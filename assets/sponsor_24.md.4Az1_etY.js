It is used as a medicinal plant and as a culinary herb. The leaves have a tarragon-like flavor, with hints of anise, and it has entered the nursery trade in North America as a tarragon substitute. Common names include sweetscented marigold, Mexican marigold, Mexican mint marigold, Mexican tarragon, sweet mace, Texas tarragon, pericón, yerbaniz, and hierbanís. Description Tagetes lucida grows 18-30 inches (46–76 cm) tall and requires full sun to light shade. Depending on land race, the plant may be fairly upright, while other forms appear bushy with many unbranching stems. The leaves are linear to oblong, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long, and shiny medium green, not blue-green as in French tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa). In late summer it bears clusters of small golden yellow flower heads on the ends of the stems. The flower heads are about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) across and have 3-5 golden-yellow ray florets. The flowers are hermaphroditic (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by insects. Uses Tagetes lucida was used by the Aztecs in a ritual incense known as Yauhtli, as well as being dedicated to the rain god . Tagetes lucida is still in use today primarily as a tea to treat the common cold, intestinal gas and diarrhea. Tagetes lucida also had many culinary uses by the Aztecs including as one of the ingredients added to make the drink chocolatl, which gave it a spicy flavor. Fresh or dried leaves are also used as a tarragon substitute for flavoring soups and sauces. A pleasant anise-flavored tea is brewed using the dried leaves and flower heads. This is primarily used medicinally in Mexico and Central America.Laferrière, Joseph E., Charles W. Weber and Edwin A. Kohlhepp. 1991b. Mineral contributions from some traditional Mexican teas. Plant Foods for Human Nutrition 41:277–282. A yellow dye can also be obtained from the flowers, and when the plant is dried and burnt, it is used as an incense and to repel insects. In one study, methanolic extract from the flower inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Candida albicans cultures. This effect was enhanced with exposure to ultraviolet light. The roots, stems, and leaves also had the same effect when irradiated with ultraviolet light.

Women's literacy had been forbidden by the religious leaders. Girls were not taught to write; a few of them had managed to learn how to read a bit of the Quran, which was written in the Arabic script.

They compete in the NCAA Division III, except for their lacrosse teams, which compete in Division I. They are primarily members of the Centennial Conference. The team colors are Hopkins blue (PMS 284) and black, and the blue jay is their mascot. Homewood Field is the home stadium. Hopkins celebrates Homecoming in the spring to coincide with the height of the lacrosse season. The Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame, governed by US Lacrosse, was located on the Homewood campus, adjacent to Homewood Field, until 2016 when it moved to its new facilities in Sparks, Maryland. Past Johns Hopkins lacrosse teams have represented the United States in international competition. At the 1932 Summer Olympics lacrosse demonstration event Hopkins played for the U.S. They have also gone to Melbourne, Australia to win the 1974 World Lacrosse Championship. Origin of the name Originally, the Johns Hopkins athletes were not called Blue Jays but the Black and Blue, a nickname derived from their athletic colors. Hopkins archivist James Stimpert has theorized that the Blue Jay name stemmed from Hopkins' student humor magazine, The Black and Blue Jay, first published in 1920. The \\"Black and Blue\\" came from the athletic colors and the \\"Jay\\" most likely stood for first initial in Johns Hopkins.

It is one of two battalions that make up the Royal Victoria Regiment (RVR), with its sister unit being 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. It can trace its history back to 1854 and the battalion has existed since maintaining an unbroken record of service, albeit in varying forms and under various names.Department of Defence 1999, p. 2. The present day unit traces its lineage from a number of previous units, including 8th Battalion (City of Ballarat Regiment), 59th Battalion (The Hume Regiment), 7th Battalion (The North and West Murray Regiment), and the 38th Battalion (The Northern Victoria Regiment). Today the battalion is part of the 4th Brigade and is responsible for most of the rural areas of Victoria and protecting vital assets in the north of Australia. The battalion maintains an affiliation with the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, with whom many members of 8/7 RVR have undertaken periods of full-time service in recent times. History The Ballarat phase of the battalion's history was formed as the Ballarat Volunteer Rifle Regiment on 9 August 1858 as a result of the Crimean War, coupled with the withdrawal of the British Army in 1857. In the years between its formation and the outbreak of War in 1914, the battalion went through a series of name changes as follows: * 1854 - Earliest units of the RVR formed ( Melbourne Volunteer Rifle Regt. ) * 1858 - Ballarat Volunteer Rifle Regiment (later Rangers) * 1884 - 3rd Balarat Ballarat Infantry * 1892 - 1st Battalion, 3rd Victorian Regiment * 1898 - 3rd battalion, Victoria Infantry Brigade * 1901 - 3rd Battalion Infantry Brigade * 1908 - 1st Battalion 7th Australian Infantry Regiment * 1912 - 70th Battalion (Ballarat Regiment) including Geelong * 1912 - 71st Battalion (City of Ballarat Regiment) Further to the north the following evolution was taking place (encompassing the Bendigo/Castlemaine and Murray river areas): * 1858 - Bendigo Rifle Regiment * 1860 - Bendigo Volunteer Rifle Corps * 1870 - Castlemaine Corps of Rifles * 1872 - Mount Alexander Bn of Victorian Rifles * 1883 - 4th Battalion of Infantry * 1887 - 4th Mount Alexander battalion of Victorian Rifles * 1893 - 2nd Battalion, 3rd Victorian Regiment * 1898 - 4th Battalion, Victorian Infantry Brigade * 1903 - 8th Australian Infantry Regiment * 1908 - 1st Battalion, 8th Australian Infantry Regiment * 1912 - 66th (Mount Alexander) Infantry When war broke out in 1914, the 8th Battalion was recruited from the Ballarat and Ararat areas and the 7th Battalion from the North Western and Murray areas. Both battalions became well known and respected for their actions in the Gallipoli campaign and later in France, earning numerous Campaign and Battle honours, some of which are emblazoned on the Royal Victorian Regiments Colours, with the remainder being held in trust by the Regimental council. After World War I, further restructuring took place in the Ballarat and North-Western Regions. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, both the 8th and 7th Battalions were again raised, and the two battalions served alongside by side during the most significant campaigns and battles of that war. Following World War II, the 8th and 7th Battalions were amalgamated to form the 8th/7th Battalion, the North Western Victorian Regiment. The battalion retained its name until 1960, when Pentropic Divisions were formed and the battalion became 2RVR, absorbing the 8th/7th, 38th and 59th Battalions. On 14 November 1987, the battalion was officially retitled the 8th/7th Battalion, The Royal Victoria Regiment. It has adopted the white (8th Battalion) and brown (7th Battalion) lanyard and wears the 8th Battalion colour patch (rectangle white over red). The Battalion Flag consists of the regimental badge on a diagonally split background of brown above white. Current status Activities and equipment The current Commanding Officer (CO) is Lieutenant Colonel Tom Biedermann. The battalion usually parades from early February until mid December, taking part on parade nights (Tuesday 7:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m.), with one weekend a month and a two-week continuous training exercise taking place throughout the year. There are several training periods per year, including several sub-unit (company) based exercises, normally run quarterly, and a range week, of which the battalion undertakes several days of weapon training. This complements the 4th Brigade's contribution to Exercise Hamel at the Cultana training area in South Australia in September, allowing training in combined/support arms tactics, with access to the full resources of the entire brigade. The battalion is light infantry based, and as such uses all the weapon platforms commonly found within an Australian infantry battalion, including the standard issue F88 Austeyr rifle (5.56 mm), F89 Minimi machine gun (5.56 mm), M72 Short Range Anti Armour Weapon (66 mm), M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel device, F1 & F3 Hand Grenades, MAG 58 machine gun (7.62 mm), 84 mm Carl Gustav rocket launcher, using the standard infantry battalion composition of four companies comprising three platoons, each containing a section of nine soldiers, with a support section held at company level. Locations 8/7 RVR is located in the state of Victoria, with the following depots: * Battalion Headquarters (BHQ), Ranger Barracks, Sturt Street, Ballarat * Combat Service Support Company (CSSC), Ranger Barracks, Sturt Street, Ballarat * Alpha Company Headquarters (A Coy), Newland Barracks, Myers Street, Geelong * Bravo Company Headquarters (B Coy), Ranger Barracks, Sturt Street, Ballarat * Charlie Company Headquarters (C Coy), Passchendaele Barracks, Atlas Road, Bendigo (Junortoun) The battalion also has regional depots located at: * Somme Barracks, Sobroan Street, Shepparton * RAAF Williams, Kidbrook Road, Laverton * Kiarivu Barracks, San Mateo Avenue, Mildura * Messine Barracks, Gray Street, Swan Hill * Tel el Eisa Barracks, Pertobe Road, Warrnambool * Testing & proving ground, Melbourne- Lancefield Road, Monegeetta Battle honours The Royal Victoria Regiment has the enviable honour of having inherited the most battle honours of any other Infantry Regiment of the Australian Defence Force. 8/7 RVR currently holds the following battle honours: * Boer War: South Africa 1899–1902. * World War I: Landing at Anzac Cove, Somme 1916–1918, Bullecourt, Ypres 1917, Polygon Wood, Amiens, Albert 1918, Mont St Quentin, Hindenburg Line. * World War II: Bardia 1941, Capture of Tobruk, El Alamein, Greece 1941, South West Pacific 1942–1945, Bobdubi, Finisterres, Hari River, Borneo.

An electric lead guitar played solo lines with a bass tendency, and reverberation was applied for a deep sound. The 1957 instrumental Raunchy was probably the first such big hit. Duane Eddy and his producer Lee Hazlewood probably perfected the sound in 1958 with \\"Movin and Groovin\\" and \\"Rebel Rouser\\". The term could also be applied to the physical guitar of the player, but not because of any physical properties. For example, \\"the big guitar of Al Caiola\\". Leading practitioners included Al Caiola (\\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"Bonanza\\") and Billy Strange. The Ventures and many other instrumental groups did not generally fit this category. It became incorporated in many pop songs. The Lawrence Welk orchestra used it in \\"Scarlet O'Hara\\", Henry Mancini used it in \\"Experiment In Terror\\" and \\"Peter Gunn\\".

During his lifetime, Hartmann occupied a central place in Danish musical life. Biography Hartmann was born and died in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of composer August Wilhelm Hartmann (1775-1850) and Christiane Petrea Frederica Wittendorff (1778-1848). He came from a musical family of German descent. Although he received his music lessons initially from his father, he taught himself as much as possible. He complied with his father's wishes for him to study jurisprudence and consequently worked as a civil servant from 1829 to 1870, but also pursued an extensive musical career. By 1824, he was already the organist at the Garnisons Kirke in Copenhagen, and in 1832, he made his debut as a composer with the opera Ravnen. In 1836, he made his first study tour to Germany and France, where he made the acquaintance of such significant musical figures as Frédéric Chopin, Gioachino Rossini, Luigi Cherubini, and Louis Spohr. Spohr and the Danish composer Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse were Hartmann's most important mentors. Further journeys to Germany followed in the next few years, during which he also founded the Danish Musical Association in 1836, remaining its chairman until the end of his life. In 1843, he transferred from Garnisons Kirke to play the organ for the Vor Frue Kirke, and became the director of the Student Choral Association. He also held both these posts until his death. In 1867, after having taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Music (Københavns Musikkonservatorium) which was originally was founded in 1825 by Giuseppe Siboni (1780–1839), Hartmann helped co-establish and direct the Academy of Music with Niels Gade (1817–1890) and Holger Simon Paulli (1810–1891). He was also the director of the Copenhagen Musical Society (Musikforeningen i København) briefly in 1890 following the death of Gade. Personal life in 1829, he married Emma Sophie Amalie Zinn (1807-1851). One of their sons, Emil Hartmann (1836–1898) also became a composer, while their son Carl Christian Ernst Hartmann(1837–1901) became a sculptor. Two of their daughters both married composers; Emma Sophie (b. 1831) married Niels Gade and Clara (b. 1839) married August Winding (1835–1899). Style J. P. E. Hartmann by August Saabye 1905, Sankt Annæ Plads, Copenhagen Hartmann's works were characterized by artistic seriousness, dramatic vitality, and in particular, by national coloring which appealed deeply to Danish audiences. The Nordic elements, which could be discerned in the themes based on folksongs, modulations, and the tendency towards rather dark sounds, emerged strongly after the 1830s. Hartmann united these Romantic influences with a strong control over both form and theme, acquired through his Classical training and often reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn.

(October 18, 1740 – November 4, 1775), born Melcior Jaume Vallespir, was a Spanish-born Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order. Born at the farm Son Baró in the village of Sant Joan, Majorca, his earliest schooling was acquired from the local parish priest. At the age of fifteen Melchor was enrolled at the convent school of San Bernardino, where Fray Junípero Serra had studied some years earlier. Melchor Jayme was admitted to the Franciscan Order on September 27, 1760 in the Convento de Santa Maria de los Angeles de Jesus. Following a year of strict seclusion and rigorous discipline, Jayme solemnly promised to observe the rule of the Friars Minor for the rest of his earthly lifespan; he was known as Fray Luis from thereon. The friar conducted his theological studies at the Convento de San Francisco (Palma de Mallorca), and was ordained to the priesthood on December 22, 1764. Fray Luis was appointed \\"Lector of Philosophy\\" upon completion of his coursework, a position he occupied at San Francisco from 1765 to 1770. Jayme arrived in New Spain in early 1770 after a long and arduous trans-Atlantic voyage. There he began the special training course at the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico wherein \\"soldiers of the Cross\\" were conditioned to the privation, fatigue, mortification and penance encountered on the missionary frontier. Fray Luis set out for California along with nine other priests to begin a ten-year commitment ministering to the indigenous population. An illustration depicts the killing of Father Luis Jayme by Kumeyaay warriors at Mission San Diego de Alcalá, November 4, 1775.Engelhardt, p. 63 Jayme was assigned to Mission San Diego de Alcalá, where his earliest efforts were devoted to mastering the complexities of the local Kumeyaay language. Once he had gained a facility with its vocabulary, he was able to compile a polyglot Christian catechism. The lack of a dependable water supply, coupled with the proximity of the military personnel at the Presidio, led to the priest asking for and being granted permission to relocate the mission from its original site, atop Presidio Hill, to the valley several miles east, where it is now situated. Almost immediately there was a noticeable increase in the number of conversions which, by 1775, stood at 431. Some of the local Kumeyaay people resented the Spanish intrusion into their land.Young, p. 12 At approximately 1:30 a.m., on the moonlit morning of November 4, 1775, more than 600 warriors from the surrounding rancherías silently crept into the mission compound. After plundering the chapel, they set the other buildings ablaze. The commotion soon awakened the two missionaries, the Spanish guards, and the Christian neophytes. Rather than run to the stock hold for shelter, Fray Luis walked toward the band of warriors, uttering the traditional Franciscan greeting: \\"Amar a Dios, hijos!\\"--\\"Love God, my children!\\" Engelhardt, p. 64 The Kumeyaay seized him, stripped off his garments, shot some eighteen arrows into his torso, then smashed his face with clubs and stones. Jayme's body was, at first, interred in the Presidio chapel. When the new church at the mission was completed, the body was reinterred in the sanctuary. There it rested until November 12, 1813 when it was transferred once more. Today, the remains of Fray Luis Jayme lie in a common vault between the main and side altar. He is considered to be the first Catholic martyr in Alta California.Leffingwell, pp. 19, 132 Notes References  * Weber, Msgr. Francis J.

He opted to remain in Europe, however, and went on to play for the Deutsche Bank Skyliners in the 2002–03 and Mitteldeutscher BC for the 2003–04 season, where he won the FIBA Europe Cup. In 2004, he joined the New Yorker Phantoms Braunschweig for three seasons, but was unable to provide any impact due to injuries. In 2008, he joined the team of SG Braunschweig in the German second league to gain some playing experience. In summer 2009 he went back to Mitteldeutscher BC, but has not played in a game yet. Instead he is working as an assistant coach with the Under-19 team of Mitteldeutscher BC. Fehse also has made appearances for the German national youth team in the 2000 qualifying tournament for the FIBA World Championship. On 22 December 2009 Fehse's rights were traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder (formerly the Seattle SuperSonics) to the Utah Jazz for Eric Maynor and the contract of injured forward Matt Harpring. The trade was primarily a salary dump for the Jazz to decrease their luxury tax assessment.

However, with the departure of NBC Entertainment chairman Ben Silverman in 2009, it never came to air or even went beyond having a pilot filmed. However NBC did produce a Spanish language remake called Sin Senos no Hay Paraíso for its Hispanic- American audience . Background The showMatea Gold (October 23, 2007)Accent on talent LA Times. Accessed October 17, 2008. was set to revolve around the adventures of a young prostitute, who seeks massive breast implants to attract a rich cocaine smuggler. The Colombian version's final episode scored a record 63 share of the country's viewers. The story originated with investigative journalist Gustavo Bolivar's eponymous debut novel about child prostitution. In April 2008, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC, said that \\"We're continuing to develop it,\\" but he hinted that an English-language version may not be produced. \\"It's very likely, actually, to go on Telemundo,\\" he said. \\"Our script wasn't quite ready.\\" NBC has said little about this project since it first announced in mid-2007 and no pilot has been produced. The network announced in June that the series remained in development for the 2009–2010 season - or beyond. However, with Silverman's departure from the network in June 2009 and the network completely distancing itself from most of the pilots brought in by SIlverman which never made it to series, the project is likely dead and unlikely to be revived by NBC. Story 'Without Breasts There Is No Paradise' tells the story of 17-year-old Catalina, a gorgeous young girl who descends into a decadent world of easy money as a teen prostitute \\"pre-paid girl\\". She lives in a poor neighborhood with her single mother, Doña Hilda and brother, Byron that is a \\"hitman\\" and gets paid for killing people on a motorcycle. Catalina dreams of a life of luxury, just like her friends, Paola, Ximena and Vanessa. Yessica is her best friend and ring leader in charge of the prostitution business of the group and stays in touch with the drug traffickers for when they want girls to stay with them for the weekend. Although, they are all admired by her beauty, her breasts aren't big enough to attract a wealthy pusher whom she can seduce into making her a pampered paramour. Sick of poverty, Catalina decides that plastic surgery is her only ticket into a better life. As Catalina chases for her dreams, her boyfriend, Albeiro gets tired of waiting for her, never really knowing where she might be or whom she may be with and where she gets so much money from. He eventually develops an intimate relationship with Catalina's mother, Doña Hilda. Later on, while on regular hitman duties Byron is caught and killed by the police. During Catalina's pursuit, she is raped, gets an abortion, receives bad surgery and get allergic reaction from it and dives into the sex trade. Catalina eventually gets everything she ever dreamed and wanted when she marries drug trafficker, Marcial who falls in love with her instantly. Although, she loves Albeiro. Yessica, soon becomes envious of everything that Catalina has and betrays her, by recording Catalina discuss her true feelings about her much older husband, Marcial. Leaving Catalina poor again. She sells her body to raise money for breast augmentation. After four operations, feeling that she has nobody after everyone she cared about betrayed her, she loses the will to live, tries to commit suicide but isn't able to, so she seeks help from Marcial's bodyguard, who is secretly in love with her to hire hitmen to kill Yessica. Instead she arranges for them to kill her, while making them think she is Yessica. As she falls to the ground dead, she had written in a book, \\"It's a lie, without breasts there is no paradise.\\" Origins Gustavo Bolivar's heroine is a \\"pre-paid girl,\\" which means she sells her services around-the-clock for a set period, hoping to make extra money. The screenwriter says Paraiso highlights an unflattering part of his country: teenagers in the Colombian narco-culture getting the breast implants. Bolívar says the story is based on real-life conditions facing child prostitutes in the town of Pereira. There he met two girls who were desperate for silicone breasts. One told him that she got her operation for free in exchange for sex. Unfortunately, the doctor used a pair of used implants, which led to allergic reactions and infection. Development This was the first television show Ben Silverman bought after being named co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. He named Gary Scott Thompson, creator of Las Vegas, as executive producer.http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070716/THINGS0206/707160383/1001/news NBC would air the program in a style structured like that of the adapted Ugly Betty, which was also produced under Silverman's Reveille Productions.Telenovela gets new life in English : TV : Albuquerque Tribune This show's unique name attracted media attention.

In early 2006, it commissioned an English version of El Cuerpo del Deseo (Body of Desire), which was a hit on sister network Telemundo. That same year, it inked a deal with a two-year contract with the Los Angeles production company Galán Entertainment to adapt Deseo and other Spanish serials for use on NBC, Bravo and USA Network. However, with the disastrous launch of the competing new network MyNetworkTV using a telenovela model in the fall of 2006, these projects never came to even the pilot stage on NBC or NBC's cable networks. Spanish version NBC Universal commissioned both English and Spanish versions of the Colombian serial to be produced independently.http://nbcumv.com/telemundo/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20070614000000-nbcuniversalscores.html?rss=1 Telemundo developed the Spanish version using a different cast and script, and this was the only version of the series to air in the United States.

He was known for his swarthy looks and a prominent big nose, which was often the target of ridicule, especially Dolphy calling him baboy ramo (wild boar). Panchito frequently appeared as a comedic foil to Dolphy, with whom he was best friends in real life. Biography Panchito was born in Paco, Manila. His mother, Etang Discher, became a prominent film actress beginning in the 1940s, often being cast in villainous roles. One of his brothers, Emil Tagle, also became a film actor. He was married with children. His aunt, Elaina Discher, was also a Filipina actress. Panchito's career in show business began in 1942 when he joined a bodabil troupe called \\"Travel Stage Show\\" which performed in various theaters in Japanese-occupied Manila. The then-14-year- old Dolphy was also a member of the troupe, thus beginning a lifelong association. Film career Panchito's film career began when he, along with Dolphy, were cast by Sampaguita Pictures in the Tita Duran-Pancho Magalona musical Sa Isang Sulyap Mo, Tita. It was a career that lasted until his death. In 1955, Panchito was awarded the FAMAS Best Supporting Actor award for his role in Lupang Kayumanggi. His film career thrived despite his involvement in a 1964 mauling incident in Quezon City that led to the filing of a criminal information against him and several others for frustrated murder, though the case against him would be later dismissed. Panchito is perhaps best known for his over 50-plus film team-ups with Dolphy in such movies as Kalabog en Bosyo (1959); Beatnik (1960); Si Lucio at Miguel (1962); Pepe and Pilar (1966); Pacifica Falayfay (1969); Fefita Fofongay (1973); Bugoy (1979); and Bakit Kinagat ni Adan ang Mansanas ni Eba? (1989). The partnership likewise extended to television, where the duo would co-star in an ABS-CBN variety show, Buhay Artista (1965–1972). The tandem was famous for a comedic duet routine wherein one would interrupt the other to offer a mangled translation of a Tagalog lyric into English or vice versa. On July 4, 1966, Dolphy and Panchito opened for The Beatles at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex during that band's infamously abbreviated concert tour of Manila. Apart from his partnership with Dolphy, Panchito became known as a supporting player in many other film comedies. He was frequently cast as an authority figure such as a policeman, a politician, a father-of-the-family, and memorably, as the hula skirt-clad music teacher of Jaena High School in the Joey de Leon-Rene Requiestas starrer Elvis and James (1989) and as \\"Paenguin\\" (a parody of Batman's arch-nemesis The Penguin) in the comedy-spoof Alyas Batman en Robin (1991). In 1993, Panchito lived for a while in the United States, purportedly to seek treatment after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In early 1995, his best friend Dolphy and nephew Babalu visited him in the States where he was convinced to appear in the movie \\"Home Sic Home\\", a comedy film shot both in the Philippines and San Francisco, U.S.A. and produced by Star Cinema. Though his movements were limited throughout the movie due to his medical condition, his comeback was well-received by the viewers. Soon after he decided to come back to the Philippines to resume his showbiz career. His guesting in Home Along da Riles rated high and he was cast in Dolphy and Vandolph's movie \\"Father en Son\\". However, while doing some scenes for the film in October 1995, he suffered a stroke that left him comatose. A video of him lying incapacitated in bed aired on Philippine television. During his comatose period at the hospital, he was able to receive medical and financial support from his former co-stars. Aside from Dolphy, Eat Bulaga main hosts Vic Sotto and Joey de Leon also visited him. He died two months later, on December 18, 1995 at the age of 70, two days after the death of Bert Tawa Marcelo, and two months before his 71st birthday. It was also reported that Dolphy decided to include Panchito's partially-shot scenes in \\"Father en Son\\" at the final film cut as tribute to his long-time comic partner. In 2007, Alpha Music Corporation released an album-compilation entitled The Best of Dolphy & Panchito, featuring 14 comedic duets of the comic tandem.

It was designed by Henry Kitchen in , John Verge in and A. J. Onslow in and built from 1819 to 1840 by John Macarthur in , James English and Sons in and John Sulman . The property is owned by Belgenny Farm Trust and Camden Park Preservation Committee. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006. Today, part of the original estate contains the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute; having originally served as a commercial sheep station and horticultural farm for the Macarthur family since the early 1800s.  History  When the first fleet arrived in Sydney Cove in 1788 they found the soil unsuitable for farming and soon looked towards the heavy clay and loam soils of the Cumberland Plain (to the west) to sustain the colony. Early agricultural settlements were located on the rich alluvial soils of the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges River areas, as well as South Creek near and at the head of the Parramatta River where the settlement of Rose Hill (later Parramatta) was established about six months after the fleet landed. A settlement at the Hawkesbury was established in 1794.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20. The first European settlers in the Camden area were the cattle that escaped from Sydney Cove in 1788 and found their way to the lush pastures of the Wianamatta Shale region. It was the loss of these cattle that led to the discovery of this fertile landscape in 1795, when a party sent by Governor Hunter to investigate rumours of the strayed cattle discovered them in an area they promptly named \\"Cowpastures\\". The Cowpastures remained unoccupied due to the official decree that reserved the land for the wild cattle (to encourage their increase). This area was the traditional land of the Gandangara people.Garran, 1978, 530. The earliest recorded contact between Europeans and Aboriginal people in this area was described by the French explorer, Francis Barrallier in 1802. Travelling through Cowpastures with his party, Barrallier recorded in his journal that \\"he met and befriended the Gandangara people\\".Barrallier, 1897, 749-825 Evidence of Macarthur's later meeting the Gandangara people is documented in some early records of the \\"Macarthurs of Camden\\". When the Privy Council asked Macarthur about \\"natives\\" in the area mooted for pastoral land, Macarthur replied that \\"they come amongst the settlers familiarly, but have no fixed abode, and live upon what they can find for themselves\\". Within a few years of the Gandangara people formally welcoming Barallier, John Macarthur had settled down in the best part of their traditional lands to graze sheep. James Macarthur and family members have recounted stories of Aboriginal corroborees near Camden Park in 1839, 1846 and 1850. Moves towards the establishment of Belgenny Farm were first made in 1801, when John Macarthur was exiled to England for causing dissent after fighting a duel in which he shot his own commanding officer. While in England, Macarthur worked to promote his own interests and that of the colony by setting out the groundwork for a wool industry. He convinced the British Secretary of State, Lord Camden, to provide him with more land to pasture his flocks, and he also acquired a small number of merino sheep from the flocks of King George III.Australian Encyclopaedia Vol.7, 6th ed. In December 1803 Governor King and Mrs King visited the Cowpastures for themselves and the Sydney Gazette reported that Mrs King was the first \\"white lady\\" to have crossed the Nepean River. By 1804 much of the Cumberland Plain had been settled and King began to look for other regions in the colony for favourable arable land. The only suitable land within the Cumberland Plain was the area known as the Cowpastures, located in the south-western corner. This area was named after the discovery in 1795 of cows from the first fleet which had wandered off into the bush. The track to the Cowpastures led from Prospect and on 17 September 1805 James Meehan, under instructions from Governor King, commenced a survey of the track from Prospect to the Nepean Crossing and a rough road followed the marked line. This became known as Cowpasture Road, later the Hume Highway, most of which is today part of the Camden Valley Way. Several visits to the area by the colonial gentry took place at this time, which resulted in their desire to acquire some of this rich land for themselves. They saw the area as containing very good grazing land. Captain Henry Waterhouse described the area in a letter to John Macarthur in 1804 as follows: \\"I am at a loss to describe the face of the country other than as a beautiful park, totally divested of underwood, interspersed with plains, with rich luxuriant grass\\". Earlier Europeans had described \\"large ponds covered with ducks and the black swan, the margins of which were fringed with shrubs of the most delightful tints\\". The Europeans thought the flats were perfect for cattle and the hills would carry sheep. They admired the absence of underbush - probably achieved through Aboriginal burning off - and felt comfortable with a landscape that reminded them of an English gentleman's park.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20 On his return to NSW in 1805 with an additional grant from Lord Camden, John Macarthur selected land known as the Cowpastures on the western side of Nepean River. Although these were the traditional lands of the Gandangara people, Macarthur expressed his gratitude to Lord Camden by naming the 1805 grant \\"Camden\\". From this time, John Macarthur resigned his commission as leader of the opposition to Governor Bligh and devoted himself to farming and commercial activities. Macarthur received the first land grant in the Cowpastures region in 1805 for his role in the early wool industry in the colony. Lord Camden rewarded him with and Macarthur chose the highly coveted Cowpastures for his grant, though Governor King tried to prevent him taking it. Macarthur also organised a grant for his friend Walter Davidson, who allowed Macarthur to use his land freely after Davidson returned to England. In this manner Macarthur controlled of riverbank on the site where the wild cattle had first discovered the best pasture near Sydney. Later purchases and exchanges increased the Macarthur land there to over , an endowment that Governor Macquarie greatly resented. Other early grants were in the Parishes of Minto and in adjoining Evan, Bringelly, Narellan and Cook. These all lay west of Parramatta.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 21 James Macarthur and family members have recounted stories of Aboriginal corroborees near Camden Park in 1839, 1846 and 1850. One of the first improvements Macarthur made to the property was the construction of a small hut on a ridge at Benkennie (Belgenny). Contemporary illustrations show it to have been a simple slab hut with a bark roof and a chimney on one side. It was located a short distance from the present Belgenny Cottage. However, disputes continued between Macarthur and Bligh over the control of the rum trade and its use as a currency. In 1807 when Macarthur resisted Bligh's order to arrest him, Bligh had him placed under \\"house arrest\\" by Rum Corps officers. Macarthur was effectively exiled from the colony from 1810 to 1817 for his involvement in the \\"Rum Rebellion\\", leaving his wife Elizabeth to do most of the work in developing food production at Camden Park.Australian Encyclopaedia Vol. 7, 6th ed. Elizabeth left her residence at Elizabeth Farm and spent the culling season in the original hut while she managed the property. Governor and Mrs Macquarie stayed there during their visit in 1810 and described the hut as \\"small and miserable\\". By 1813, the Camden Park flock had increased to 4033 and a wool store had been built to house the clip.  Origins  John Macarthur, who had arrived in the colony of New South Wales in 1790 had quarrelled with successive Governors. He was forced to return to England to face trial for duelling (the charges were dismissed). While he was there, he gained the patronage of, among others, the Colonial Secretary, Lord Camden. Camden supported Macarthur and ordered Governor King to grant Macarthur 5,000 acres (20 km²) at a location of his own choosing. In 1805 when Macarthur returned to Sydney he choose the fertile 'Cowpastures', which was the first area beyond the Nepean River to be settled. King grudgingly acceded to Lord Camden's wishes, and the grant was verified in 1806. Macarthur named his new property 'Camden Park' in honour of his patron. Amongst the first structures to be built at Camden Park was a slab and bark hut, referred to as the 'miserable hut' by Governor Macquarie. Located to the immediate North of the Belgenny Farm complex, the area thought to have been the site of this and other huts was the subject of an archaeological dig in 2009. From 1809 to 1817, John Macarthur left Australia as a result of his pivotal involvement in the revolt that overthrew Governor William Bligh, the so-called Rum Rebellion. His wife Elizabeth managed his extensive pastoral interests in his absence. While in Europe, Macarthur studied agriculture and viticulture, and toured on foot throughout France with his sons James and William. John Macarthur was allowed to return to the colony in 1817 on condition that he no longer participate in public affairs. He turned his attentions to developing his considerable estates, and the merino flocks which he had moved to Camden Park. Viticulture and agriculture In 1816, the Royal Society for the Arts in England had offered medals for wine from New South Wales. As early as that year, Blaxland (at Brush Farm in Ryde) was sending wine to Governor Macquarie to keep him informed about the possibility of an Australian wine industry. Blaxland certainly knew of the grape varieties brought back to Australia in 1817 by John, James and William Macarthur and of their plantings at Camden Park. But their first vintage was not until 1824.Blaxcel, 14 October 2010. John Macarthur returned from England in 1817 with his two sons, James and William, and began to expand the productivity of the farm by introducing vine cuttings, olive trees and various seeds and agricultural implements purchased overseas. However an olive tree at the Macarthurs' Elizabeth Farm, Parramatta, dates from and the first olive trees presented to Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens as a gift of the Macarthurs in 1816 predate the Camden Park olive trees. By 1819 a new cottage had been built at Belgenny, possibly designed by Henry Kitchen, and Macarthur was dividing his time between Camden, Elizabeth Farm and Hambledon Cottage at Parramatta. The following decade was prosperous for the family with their wool receiving record prices and prizes. Belgenny was the centre of operations for the Camden estate and its importance increased as the family's pastoral and agricultural activities were concentrated on the estate. An additional were granted to the family in four separate parcels with a further rented. Clearing and burning programs were begun to prepare the land and threshing and dressing machines were ordered from local merchants. In 1824 a house site had been fenced off and a dairy had been built which employed 14 dairymaids and 23 shepherds. This implies that there were a number of dwellings for the estate workers in existence at this time. A further were added to the estate holdings in 1825 expanding the property to an area covering over , with an additional 400 hectares under lease. In 1825 James Busby wrote the first of a number of books on viticulture and wine making. In 1833, he brought 437 grape cuttings back to NSW and made these widely available (through the Botanic Gardens, Sydney). Busby, who had been trained in vineyard management, grape varieties and wine making in France, referred to Mr Blaxland's vineyard as being a showplace in the Sydney Basin. He commented on the generosity of Blaxland to share his knowledge and cuttings from his vineyard. Cuttings from Brush Farm provided early vines for Wyndham Estate (at Dalwood) in the Hunter Valley. It was not until the 1830s that William Macarthur sent 34,000 vines from Camden Park estate to the Barossa Valley in South Australia, to begin the wine industry in that state. The creamery was built with a number of other buildings, including modifications to the stables. These were originally two separate buildings that were joined to form one continuous building. In 1827 the community was provided with a place of worship, possibly made to serve later as a school. At the end of this decade the property was fenced. Livestock included sheep, horses, cattle and dairy cows. Crops included maize and wheat which grew along the river flats. During the 1830s, orchards, tobacco and vegetable crops were established and a mechanical irrigation system installed. Camden House was built between 1832 and 1835 but Belgenny remained the agricultural focus of the estate. It was here that John Macarthur lived out the final years of his life. He died in 1834 and was buried in the family cemetery located on a nearby hill. William Macarthur took over the management of the estate after his father's death and was responsible for the introduction and hybridization of many exotic plant species, and experiments with new agricultural methods. William was also committed to commercial and scientific agriculture and horticulture and purchased a considerable amount of farm machinery in Europe. Between 1837 and 1839, a commercial dairy was established and the Macarthurs brought out 42 families and a small number of single men to settle at Camden Park. Each settler was provided with a two-bedroom cottage with a kitchen, small pantry, verandah and a quarter-acre block. The estate and Macarthur family were instrumental (along with Brush Farm, Ryde via Gregory Blaxland and the Sydney Botanic Gardens, via James Busby) in establishing the Australian wine industry. Camden Park became world-renowned for the quality of its wine. It played a vital role in the fledgling Australian wine industry through its importation and distribution of vine cuttings throughout NSW and the Barossa Valley of SA. By 1841 William & James were producing more than and that wintage won Gold Medals in England. In 1844 24,000 vine cuttings were sent from Camden Park to Adelaide, setting South Australia on a path to becoming an internationally acclaimed wine growing district. By 1853 Camden Park listed some 33 grape varieties for sale.Everett, (1) 2004. Camden Park became world- renowned for the quality of its wine and by 1845 was producing around per annum as a serious vineyard and one of the most highly regarded in the colony and with quite a reputation overseas.Everett, (2) 2004. The Australian Dictionary of Biography entry for Sir William Macarthur 1800-1882 mentions that William \\"grew many fruit trees, vegetables and flowers and that later he built a hothouse and imported valuable orchids\\". Although there is no evidence of any breeding of ornamental garden plants in the early days of the colony, botanical records dating from 1831 reveal a growing interest in plant hybridisation and colonial botanical assignments. Early botanical records held at the Royal Botanical Gardens Sydney, show that William Macarthur of Camden Park collected native plant specimens from all over NSW, and was donating oleanders and cape bulbs to the gardens from 1827. He also imported Australia's second consignment of camellias from England on the ship Sovereign in 1831, the first being imported from England by Alexander Macleay of Elizabeth Bay House and Brownlow Hill in 1826.Spencer, 322-323, A camellia japonica \\"Anemoniflora\\" or \\"Red waratah\\" bush still survives at Camden Park House garden today and is possibly the oldest surviving camellia plant in Australia. With the publication of Catalogue of Plants Cultivated at Camden, 1845, it is apparent that the introduction, hybridization, distribution and export of ornamental garden plants was becoming a growing industry. Of particular interest to the colony's growing plant industry was mention of new varieties of hibiscus and camellia being hybridised at Camden Park.Australian Garden History, Vol 3 No 4. p10 The first hibiscus to be introduced to NSW was an import of a single \\"red\\" by John Macarthur. The hybrid of this hibiscus became known as H. x camdenii.Spencer, 376 Macarthur introduced at least a thousand varieties of new plants and from 1843, the Macarthurs published an annual catalogue of their plants. Exports were also listed in this publication, with the 1845 edition noting that William Macarthur sent two hybrid coral trees known as \\"Erythrina camdenensis\\" to Conrad Loddiges and Sons, a well-known Hackney nurseryman in London. This coral tree is believed to be the first Australian hybrid garden plant to be published in England, in 1847. William Macarthur continued to donate plants to the Royal Botanical Gardens Sydney until 1880, including roses, pelargoniums, orchards, palms, araucarias and tropical shrubs. He also regularly received plants from the Royal Botanical Gardens Sydney between 1835 and 1868, including grapes, Australasian conifers, African gesneriads and native plants. The orchard and nursery formed important parts of the estate, with the orchard surviving until the 1970s. A single \\"Gravenstein\\" apple tree is all that now remains, and it is perhaps the oldest surviving apple tree in Australia. A camellia japonica \\"Anemoniflora\\" (anemone flowered / waratah form) bush survives at Camden Park house today, and is possibly the oldest surviving camellia plant in Australia. John Gould Veitch, esteemed English nurseryman described Camden Park on a visit in 1864: William, in conjunction with John Carne Bidwill, was involved with plant hybridization including roses, camellias, gladioli, cape bulbs and gesneriads such as African violets. He actively corresponded with botanists in England, Europe, America and India, exchanging plants and seeds. The Macarthurs compiled a collection of botanical specimens (about 100 survive) both of plants on the estate and from the district. This collection represents amateur botany and curation from at least the 1830s onwards, being some of the earliest such work and study done here. Rarer species are held as duplicates by the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. William also produced the first hybrid in Australia when he crossed one cape bulb hybridized Crinum x scabropedunculation (C. scabrum South Africa) with a native species parent C. pedunculatum. Joseph Hooker, the Director of the Kew Gardens in London, credited John Carne Bidwill with its creation, although Bidwill himself credited William Macarthur.personal communication with Mills, 2001.  Gardens and vineyard  Illustration of Erythrina ×bidwillii 'Camdeni' — a cultivar developed at Camden Park. Wine label of James and William Macarthur — used for wine produced at Camden Park Estate. The extensive vineyards were later destroyed during the international phylloxera outbreak of the 1870s. On a hill directly facing the front of the house is the family mausoleum where John and Elizabeth Macarthur and most of their children are buried; a painting by Conrad Martens in the house collection depicts the structure. Members of the family in the direct line are still buried here. The graveyard is an excellent example of colonial arcadian landscaping, with exotic Chinese elms dominating the planting. The gardens surrounding Camden Park are the largest and most intact Australian early colonial garden in existence. They are largely the creation of Sir William Macarthur, who was a keen botanist and horticulturalist and operated a sizeable commercial nursery from the estate. Old catalogues of plants for sale from the Camden Nursery provide an idea as to the contents of colonial gardens. Many trees date from the 19th century, including a bauhinia planted by Ludwig Leichhardt, the oldest camellia in the country - the 'anemoniflora' or 'waratah' camellia (Camellia japonica var. anemoniflora), a Queensland 'bottle tree' and unusual jubaea palms (Jubaea chilensis). Camden Park has always been associated with camellias, William having produced the first Australian camellia cultivar here, the 'Aspasia macarthur'. The gardens and landscape are a combination of the colonial picturesque - which in the Cowpastures area had a decidedly 'arcadian' quality - and the gardenesque. Vistas from the house stretch out to nearby Mount Annan, Mount Gilead, the church spire of St John's at Camden, and the family cemetery. The location of St Johns was carefully surveyed by Sir Thomas Mitchell; from the house carriage loop the spire is symmetrically framed by the distant Mountains Hunter and Taurus, earning the church the local quip 'built to the glory of God and to enhance the view of the Macarthurs'. Although the export of ornamental garden plants was not one of Camden Park's major industries, nursery catalogues reveal that cultivars from Camden Park were being sent to Rules Nursery, St Kilda, Victoria, as late as 1852.Spencer, 324 William encouraged winemaking and brought out several German vignerons and their families. From the 1830s onward, the estate played a major role in establishing the wine industry by exporting tens of thousands of vine cuttings to Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.personal communication with Colin Mills, 2001. During the 1840s, vineyards were planted and the home farm expanded as new buildings were constructed and additions made to the cottage. The estate and family were instrumental in establishing the Australian wine industry. Camden Park became world-renowned for the quality of its wine. Camden Park played a vital role in the fledgling Australian wine industry through its importation and distribution of vine cuttings throughout NSW and the Barossa Valley of SA. By 1853 Camden Park listed some 33 grape varieties for sale. By 1841 William & James were producing more than 5000 gallons and that vintage won Gold Medals in England. In 1844 24,000 vine cuttings were sent from Camden Park to Adelaide, setting South Australia on a path to becoming an internationally acclaimed wine growing district. Camden Park became world-renowned for the quality of its wine and by 1845 was producing around per annum as a serious vineyard and one of the most highly regarded in the colony and with quite a reputation overseas. A horse stud was established at the farm, which grew in importance as a feature lasting into the new century. The granary was built at some time after 1840 and was used to store produce and the carpenter's shop may have been erected at this time although its original function is unknown. The economic recession of 1840 resulted in some land being sold with the proceeds from the sale used to fund the construction of a road network and an underground silo. By 1846, tenants had increased in number as more than 800 people lived on the property, occupying more than 80 hectares. From the end of the 1840s, the sheep stud decreased in importance and grain crops emerged as a staple. Part of the sheep flock was sold to William Campbell in 1846, who moved this stock to his Victorian property, and the remainder of the flock was sold in 1849. By the late 1850s there were approximately 160 farms on the estate. The sale of livestock continued up until 1856 when most of the horse stud was gone. Governor Macquarie drew up plans in 1820 for establishment of a town in the area, to be named Campbelltown after his wife Elizabeth's maiden name. With their forced return to England in 1822 these plans never came to fruition and it was not until the arrival of Governor Darling in 1827 that plans were again reinstated and the first settlers were allowed to take possession of their town land in 1831. In the early 1850s the railway line from Sydney to Goulburn was completed, with a station opening at Campbelltown in 1858. When Leppington House was offered for lease in 1865, one of its selling points was that it was near a railway. Campbelltown now provided easy access to Sydney and its markets and grew as the centre of the district. Although Camden was established in 1836, with no railway line it remained a small town. The large estates that flanked Cowpasture Road (later Camden Valley Way) and the Northern Road were run largely as sheep and cattle farms, with wheat and other grain crops being grown as well until the 1850s. The houses were often built on surrounding ridges or hills, providing sweeping views of the countryside and ensuring that any passing traveller could appreciate the owner's status by viewing their impressive country mansions from the road. This land use pattern of large farm estates and small towns, established in the nineteenth century, remained largely the pattern of development of the area up until the late 1990s. Aerial photographs of the area in 1947 show a rural landscape with some limited urban development on either side of (then) Camden Valley Way.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 22-23 During the 1860s, crop disease caused the decline of grain as a principal economic unit. Mixed farming based on horticulture, wine, mixed grain and agistment of cattle and sheep became the dominant economic pattern. By 1875, many of the tenants were given notice to quit as a result of falling agricultural prices and changing trends in farming. There were 19 tenants on the estate when William Macarthur died in 1882, increasing to 73 by 1885. In 1889 management was taken over by Onslow and Thompson, who had plans for renovating and repairing the buildings. The estate had become a little run-down and required repairs to all of the major holdings. During the 1890s, all Camden Park Estate roads were re-laid and edged with new fence posts and rail stock fences. Planted along all the estate fencing were miles of hedges. China monthly rose had been originally introduced by John Macarthur to Elizabeth Farm Parramatta in 1848. This was probably Rosa Chinensis, \\"Parson's China monthly\\".personal communication with Lehany, 2001, In 1898, a cream separator was installed and a piggery nearby were built at Belgenny Farm. During the early 1900s, an engine room was built by the farm's carpenter to house steam and diesel engines, which were used to drive chaff cutters and other machinery. The farm had become economically negligible however the real wealth came from the orchard and dairy. In 1899 more cottages were built and a co-operative dairy was established with some of the tenant farmers. of land were reserved around the house and the remainder became Camden Park Estate Ltd. During the 1900s, new milk and hay sheds were erected. Land sales and subdivisions paid for the construction of a new dam and underground water tank. Between then and 1920, more cottages were built on the estate, a number of timber silos were built and a second dam constructed. A 1919 Royal Agricultural Society plaque honouring twelve agricultural pioneers includes Gregory Blaxland along with Sir Joseph Banks, John Macarthur, Samuel Marsden, James Busby, Alexander Berry and others. In 1921 a milk depot with a railway siding was built at Camden. Menangle Model Dairy was built in 1926 and improvements were made to the home dairy. From this time onwards the economic basis of the estate changed as the dairy activities at Menangle became prominent. The creamery building was used for this purpose. In 1928 a new timber slaughterhouse was built. By 1937, Belgenny became primarily a storage place for machinery. The working horse stables were converted to a shearing shed and additions were made to the granary and blacksmith's shop. The second storey of the creamery, which housed the cream separator, was demolished and a community hall was built. In 1952 the Rotolactor was built at Menangle. By 1965 the estate was known as Australia's largest dairy. Dairy activities centred around Menangle. Belgenny Farm was mainly used to store machinery and the working horse stables were converted into a shearing shed. In 1973, as a direct result of the rural recession of the 1970s, the land surrounding Belgenny was sold to new owner/developers with plans to redevelop the land for housing. At this time the orchard was unfortunately destroyed. In 1976 the NSW Government through the Department of Planning stepped in to conserve Belgenny Cottage and farm buildings by purchasing of land and the buildings for $1.2 million. A further were purchased in 1984 for $2.85 million. The purchase did not include the land surrounding Camden Park House, which is still owned by members of the Macarthur-Stanham family. The first work carried out on the property was the conservation of Belgenny Cottage, which was completed during the early 1980s. The NSW Department of Planning and Infrastructure currently owns the property. It is managed by the NSW Department of Agriculture, which has established the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute there. Within that, Camden Park House, garden and central portion of the estate is still owned, occupied and farmed by the Macarthur / Stanham family. Camden Park was a large sheep run established by John Macarthur south of Sydney near present- day Camden in New South Wales, Australia. Macarthur, who had arrived in the colony in 1790 as a lieutenant in the New South Wales Corp, had quarrelled with successive governors and most of his neighbours, and in 1801 was sent to England for court martial after being involved in a duel. In England charges against him were dropped. Whilst in England Macarthur lobbied hard for support for his ideas as to the production of fine wool in the colony, which he believed would end England's dependence on Spanish wool. His beliefs were largely ridiculed by Joseph Banks, who would eventually acknowledge the success of the venture. Banks was patron to William Bligh, whom Macarthur was later instrumental in overthrowing. Macarthur however had powerful patrons, including Walter Farquhar, physician to the Prince of Wales, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Camden. Camden supported him and ordered Governor King to grant Macarthur at a location of his own choosing. In 1805 when Macarthur returned to Sydney he chose the fertile \\"Cowpastures\\", which was the first area beyond the Nepean river to be settled. King begrudgingly acceded to Lord Camden's wishes, and the grant was verified in 1806. Macarthur named his new property \\"Camden Park\\" in honour of his patron. The first structure built at Camden Park was a slab and bark hut, referred to as the \\"miserable hut\\" by Governor Macquarie. The site is now marked by a stone cairn. From 1809 to 1817 John Macarthur left Australia as a result of his involvement in the Rum Rebellion. His wife Elizabeth managed his interests in his absence. While in Europe Macarthur studied agriculture and viticulture, and toured on foot throughout France with sons James and William. He was allowed to return to the colony in 1817 on condition that he no longer participate in public affairs. He now turned his attentions to developing his considerable estates, and the merino flocks which he had moved to Camden Park. In 1821 the Macarthurs built Belgenny Farm House, a timber \\"cottage ornee\\". This house and the related outbuildings, known as the \\"Camden Park Home Farm\\", form one of the oldest surviving groups of farm structures in Australia. In 1832, after Macarthur had finally decided to make Camden the \\"family seat\\", he commissioned architect John Verge to design a house of a stature suitable for one of the colony's leading and wealthiest families. The house was completed in 1835, shortly after John Macarthur's death in 1834. Sons James and William Macarthur took up occupancy in the new house, while their mother Elizabeth continue to reside at Elizabeth Farm in Parramatta, in which she had a life interest. Many of the furnishings still seen in the house were acquired by James Macarthur on a subsequent trip to England, where he met his wife Emily Stone. Their only child Elizabeth was to inherit the estate. She later married captain Arthur Onslow, and through that marriage their son James Macarthur-Onslow was to inherit both Camden Park and Elizabeth Bay House in Sydney. The current owners are the Macarthur-Stanham family. Formerly a basalt quarry, Quarry Paddock has its surface strewn with stone chips. Characterised by a steep hill, the hilltop has expansive views across the site and beyond, and overlooks the cemetery with which it has a strong visual connection. Zone 17 has a sparse and fairly continuous canopy cover of narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). Located here is also a cottage, one large olive tree (Olea europaea cv.) and remnant timber fencing.  Later years  Many of the furnishings still seen in the house at Camden Park were acquired by James Macarthur on a subsequent trip to England, where he met his wife Emily Stone. Their only child Elizabeth was to inherit the estate. She later married Captain Arthur Onslow, and through that marriage their son James Macarthur-Onslow was to inherit both Camden Park and Elizabeth Bay House (the Onslows being related to the Macleay family) in Sydney. Portraits of the principal family members hang in the house's dining and drawing rooms. 6 years after the death of her husband in 1882, Elizabeth Onslow took her children to England. While the children were at school, Elizabeth studied dairy farming and on returning to Camden in 1889 she founded a dairy farming complex, the Camden Vale Milk Co., which eventually merged with the Dairy Farmers' Co-operative Milk Co in 1928. Dairy Farmer's 'gold top' milk, known by its gold foil bottle top, was sourced from Camden Park. The property is still a working dairy farm. It is likely that Camden Park is the oldest post-1788 property still owned and occupied by descendants of its original family, the present owners being the Macarthur- Stanham family. The house and garden are open each year on the second last full weekend of September.  Description  Estate overview Camden Park was a large sheep run established by John Macarthur south of Sydney near present-day Camden in New South Wales, Australia. Macarthur, who had arrived in the colony in 1790 as a lieutenant in the New South Wales Corp, had quarrelled with successive governors and most of his neighbours, and in 1801 was sent to England for court martial after being involved in a duel. In England charges against him were dropped. Whilst in England Macarthur lobbied hard for support for his ideas as to the production of fine wool in the colony, which he believed would end Englands dependence on Spanish wool. His beliefs were largely ridiculed by Joseph Banks, who would eventually acknowledge the success of the venture. Banks was patron to William Bligh, whom Macarthur was later instrumental in overthrowing. Macarthur however had powerful patrons, including Walter Farquhar, physician to the Prince of Wales, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Camden. Camden supported him and ordered Governor King to grant Macarthur 5,000 acres at a location of his own choosing. In 1805 when Macarthur returned to Sydney he choose the fertile \\"Cowpastures\\", which was the first area beyond the Nepean river to be settled. King begrudgingly acceded to Lord Camdens wishes, and the grant was verified in 1806. Macarthur named his new property \\"Camden Park\\" in honour of his patron. The first structure built at Camden Park was a slab and bark hut, referred to as the \\"miserable hut\\" by Governor Macquarie. The site is now marked by a stone cairn. From 1809 to 1817 John Macarthur left Australia as a result of his involvement in the Rum Rebellion. His wife Elizabeth managed his interests in his absence. While in Europe Macarthur studied agriculture and viticulture, and toured on foot throughout France with sons James and William. he was allowed to return to the colony in 1817 on condition that he no longer participate in public affairs. He now turned his attentions to developing his considerable estates, and the merino flocks which he had moved to Camden Park. In 1821 the Macarthurs built Belgenny Farm House, a timber \\"cottage ornee\\". This house and the related outbuildings, known as the \\"Camden Park Home Farm\\", form one of the oldest surviving groups of farm structures in Australia. In 1832, after Macarthur had finally decided to make Camden the \\"family seat\\", he commissioned architect John Verge to design a house of a stature suitable for one of the colony's leading and wealthiest families. The house was completed in 1835, shortly after John Macarthur's death in 1834. Sons James and William Macarthur took up occupancy in the new house, while their mother Elizabeth continue to reside at Elizabeth Farm in Parramatta, in which she had a life interest. Many of the furnishings still seen in the house were acquired by James Macarthur on a subsequent trip to England, where he met his wife Emily Stone. Their only child Elizabeth was to inherit the estate. She later married captain Arthur Onslow, and through that marriage their son James Macarthur- Onslow was to inherit both Camden Park and Elizabeth Bay House in Sydney. The current owners are the Macarthur-Stanham family. Camden Park house is a two- storey Palladian structure with single-storey pavilions to either side. It is built of stuccoed sandstock brick, with window and door architraves and other detailing of locally cut stone, including Marulan mudstone. The roof is of slate, while the service wings had the first documented use of corrugated iron in the colony. The house has a colonnaded verandah and sandstone portico. The dining room has a finely detailed arched apsial end, and there is a large drawing room, library and breakfast room connected \\"en fillade\\" with views to the gardens and landscape beyond. The \\"geometric\\" staircase is to one side, not centrally placed, perhaps reflecting its rural nature. The service wings stretch to the side, rather than the rear as is conventional with colonial houses, and have a central courtyard beneath which are large cisterns. They originally had no external windows or doors, only a stronmg gate at one end, reflecting the secure nature of the house. Large cellars stretch the entire length and width of the main block of the house, and were partly used for storing the estates considerable wine production. The extensive vineyards were later destroyed after a phloxera outbreak. There is a large brick stable and, on a hill directly facing the front of the house, the family mausoleum where John and Elizabeth Macarthur and most of their children are buried. Members of the family in the direct line are still buried here. The gardens surrounding Camden Park are the largest and most intact Australian colonial garden in existence. They are largely the creation of Sir William Macarthur, who was a keen horticulturalist and operated a sizeable commercial nursery from the estate. Catalogues of plants for sale give us an excellent idea as to the contents of colonial gardens. Many trees date from the 19th century, including a bauhinia planted by Ludwig Leichhardt, the oldest camellia in the country - the camellia anemoniflora or \\"waratah\\" camellia - and unnusual jubaea palms. Camden Park has always been associated with camellias. William produced the first Australian cultivar here, the camellia \\"Aspasia macarthur\\". The gardens and landscape are a combination of the colonial picturesque - which in the Cowpastures area had a decidedly \\"arcadian\\" quality - and the gardenesque. Vistas from the house stretch out to nearby Mt Annan, Mt Gilead, the church spire at Camden, and the family cemetery. It is likely that Camden Park is the oldest post-1788 property still owned and occupied by descendants of its original family. It has an annual open weekend, held on the second last full weekend of September. Estate agricultural zones The whole land surface of the site should be considered as an ongoing and interrelated agriculture property rather than a site of individual structures or concentrated areas of heritage interest. Therefore, the property has been segmented into 21 distinctive landscape zones of internally consistent character. It is important to note that these zones are not subdivisions but a way of segmenting a large area with regard to topographic and natural features, visual catchments, existing vegetation and agricultural uses, the built environment and ownership. The property can also be broken down into four distinctive landscapes based on the approach of the 1985 Landscape Report prepared by the Government's Architect's Branch of the Public Works Department of NSW. ;Zone 1Menangle Paddock Menangle Paddock is open and expansive in character. It is a group of cleared, arable fields, gently sloping around Foot-Onslow Creek. Significant structures on this sight include a Sulman- designed gatehouse on Woodbridge Road, a row of cottages, a post office, the Department of Agriculture buildings and associated plantings along Menangle Road. This architectural edge marries the zone visually to Menangle Village. Planting within the zone occurs in a linear fashion. Willows (Salix sp.) delineate the creek, Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra 'Italica') line one of the access roads and a privet hedge forms part of the southern perimeter. Similar hedging is located in the adjacent Rotolactor property. * ;Zone 2Exposed Hills Flanking Woodbridge Road to the south of the Estate are steeply rounded grassy hillsides, almost entirely cleared of tree cover, save for one olive tree (Olea europaea cv.) 0on \\"One Tree Hill\\". A few scattered narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra), a prominent feature of exotic plantings associated with Dairy No. 4. and is visible from Menangle. Zone 2 is the only example on site of exposed hills viewed against the skyline and semi- replanting on the lower slopes retains the bare character of the hilltops. ;Zone 3Ridgetop Due to Ridgetop's height, its strong north–south axis, and the steepness of the adjacent slopes, Ridgetop forms the dominant geomorphological and visual backbone of the site. The extensive views to the east and west across the property to neighbouring countryside, Menangle village and to the ridges in the middle and far distance gives an understanding of the site's regional landscape context. It has undergone only partial clearing and presents a sparse, yet fairly continuous cover of narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). ;Zone 4Top Paddock Top Paddock comprises steep slopes and minor ridgelines to the west of the main ridge. The two valleys are nearly bare of vegetation. The three ridges have been only partly cleared and retain a fairly generous cover of Eucalyptus crebra on the upper slopes. The lower slopes have been replaced by grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana) and forest red gum (E. tereticornis) and she oak (Casuarina glauca) in areas of high soil salinity or impeded drainage. Top paddock is presently used for grazing and these steep slopes offer broad views downslope to Navigation Creek Valley. The character of this zone has changed since the completion of the Agricultural Research Station, however this site is visually contained within the landscape and is not too apparent beyond this catchment. ;Zone 5East Slopes Overlooking the Nepean Plain and river to the east, these vegetated pastoral East Slopes are very steep. Visual quality of this area is lessened by overhead transmission lines and the Department of Agriculture security fencing. The dominant species is again narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). ;Zone 6Nepean Plain Zone 6 is fairly flat land and has been completely cleared of tree cover and the only significant feature is the slight depression towards Menangle Pond. The adjacent mining operations and associated clearing are highly visible. ;Zone 7Mining Lands As a result, from Menangle Sand and Soil mining operations, the original land profile has been lowered and the river banks have been destabilised. Zone 7 was almost completely cleared of indigenous vegetation until rehabilitation, however weed growth has appeared and the natural river character has been lost. Without control, the river bank vegetation and visual qualities may be completely lost. ;Zone 8Barragal In the northern portion of the Nepean Plain, Barragal Lagoon is overlooked from the north by a steep hill accommodating a sandstone monument that marks the camping place where Governor Macquarie and his wife stayed in 1810. From the hilltop, superior views include the lagoon and swale in the foreground. In the middle distance are views of the Nepean Plain and river and Menangle village beyond. On the lagoon fringe grows blue box (Eucalyptus bauerana) while forest red gum (E. tereticornis) woodland and grassy understorey dominates the upper slopes. Waterfowl frequent the lagoon and other species of birds vary with fluctuating water levels. ;Zone 9Sawyers Paddock Sawyers Paddock has an open character and is visually contained although distant ridges to the east are visible. Sawyers Paddock is pastoral land on a minor ridgeline crossed by overhead transmission lines. It is partly vegetated with grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana). ;Zone 10Hamlet Basin Hamlet Basin has a levee depression formation that runs parallel with the existing river course. Zone 10 comprises several lagoons and ponds, a deep natural swale along the southern orchard boundary. Its enclosed atmosphere is created by the low ridge to the west, and the riverbank and orchard planting to the east which it overlooks. Located in Zone 10 are six workers' cottages that are associated with the orchard. The pastoral basin itself is sparsely vegetated with rough barked apple (Angophora subvelutina), she oak (Casuarina glauca) and cabbage gum (Eucalyptus amplifolia), and the swale with large specimens of rough barked apple (A subvelutina), and river oak (Casuarina cunninghamiana). ;Zone 11Indigenous Reserve Indigenous Reserve is referred to as \\"Sawyer's Wildlife Conservation Area\\" and has been enclosed to allow for the regeneration of indigenous vegetation. This controlled zone has seen the re-emergence of a dense understorey of herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings which is uncharacteristic of the rest of the Estate. The dominant indigenous vegetation is rough barked apple (Angophora subvelutina), cabbage gum (Eucalyptus amplifolia), and ribbon gum (E.viminalis). ;Zone 12Orchard Zone 12 is presently used in part for grazing and fodder crops and is enclosed by riverbank vegetation to the north and east, and by the Indigenous Reserve to the west. These expansive flat fields form a portion of the river terrace and remnant fruit trees are found closer to the river bank. Vegetation is significant in this area due to the exotic plantings carried out by William Macarthur. Extensive remnants of these plantings survive today and some specimens being at least 140 years old. Of particular significance was a small Gravenstein apple tree (Malus sylvestris 'Gravenstein') that was planted and was believed to be one of the oldest apple trees still in existence in the country. This tree has since died and attempts to graft onto the roots have failed.2007, pers. comm., S. Read In the recent past the southern extent of the Orchard was used as a citrus grove. The Orchard also includes structures such as the old piggeries and sheds. Other mature exotic trees are growing on the far side of the orchard on the flat to the NE of the house/garden a few kilometres away though off the Menagle Road. These comprise an evergreen magnolia / bull bay (Magnolia grandiflora) years old, male and female maidenhair trees (Ginkgo biloba) and several cork oaks (Quercus suber).Pers. comm., S. Read, 6/6/2007 ;Zone 13Navigation Creek Valley This is a broad, fairly flat, alluvial and flood-prone valley extending approximately north–south the length of the Estate, exhibiting erosion near the creek head to the south. In its northern extent it is open and pastoral in character, and largely bare of vegetation except for some she oaks (Casurarina glauca) along the creek. To the south, vegetation is diverse with Angophora hybrids and Pimelea spp. ;Zone 14Cummin's Flat Hawkey's Dam, a shallow damming of Navigation Creek, enclosed on the east and west by hills and on its perimeter by tree planting to prevent wind evaporation, is a working example of Keyline practice (based on the writings of P.A. Yeomans). Perimeter plantings carried out in 1960-61 include she oak (Casuarina glauca), flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), spotted gum (Corymbia maculata), grey gum (Eucalyptus moluccana), mugga ironbark (E.sideroxylon var. Rosea), forest red gum (E. tereticonis), Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra 'Italica'). Cummin's Flat is very open, flat and grassy with glimpses of water to be viewed through the trees and reflections of flooded Gums in the northern part of the dam. Cummin's Flat is susceptible to evaporation and when the water volume is low, the flat is used for grazing. ;Zone 15West Expanse This West Expanse is flanked by the Hume Highway and Finns Road to the west of the Estate and has broad views across the site to the central ridge. Zone 15 is a hilly and pastoral terrain and comprises a fairly sparse canopy cover of narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra), grey gum (E. moluccanna) and open woodland of she oak (Casuarina glauca). Cameron's Dam with perimeter row planting of river oak (Casuarina cunninghamiana), flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), spotted gum (Corymbia maculata), Mugga ironbark (E. sideroxylon 'Rosea'), and silky oak (Grevillea robusta) is also located in this vicinity. The west expanse also contains two groups of dairy buildings and associated plantings located on two dairy farms. ;Zone 16Camden Paddock Camden Paddock is characterised by a gentle undulating landscape. Open in character, Camden Paddock's north-west boundary forms the edge between the Estate and suburbia. A pastoral landscape associated with Belgenny, the Macarthur cemetery, the calf pens and the dairy, it is almost entirely clear of vegetation aside from a few scattered rough barked apple (Angophora subvelutina) to the south and dam planting to the north. ;Zone 17Quarry Paddock Formerly a basalt quarry, Quarry Paddock has its surface strewn with stone chips. Characterised by a steep hill, the hilltop has expansive views across the site and beyond, and overlooks the cemetery with which it has a strong visual connection. Zone 17 has a sparse and fairly continuous canopy cover of narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). Located here is also a cottage, one large olive tree (Olea europaea cv.) and remnant timber fencing. ;Zone 18Cemetery Located on top of a knoll, the cemetery is significant burial ground for generations of Macarthur descendants, and the focus of dense exotic plantings. Enclosed and restful, its location above the flood-prone valley offers extensive views to the east of the Macarthur-Onslow Estate, and to the north-west over Belgenny, forming an important component of the landscape. William Macarthur established these cemetery gardens in 1834 and designed them to have two distinct compartments. The cemetery gardens were developed in the style of the English Landscape School. An iron palisade fence surrounds the outer perimeter garden and a second internal palisade fence contains the graveyard and further plantings. The southern side of the graveyard contains a single large tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides) and is a rare botanical specimen planting. The major components of this area are Port Jackson pine or native cypress(Callitris rhomboidea) and the kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum) which are likely to be remnants of the original dry hill top woodland. African olives (Olea europaea var. africana) also dominate the canopy. ;Zone 19Belgenny Farm Belgenny Farm was the headquarters for what is now the Camden Park Estate and is sited on a minor ridgeline. Belgenny has a strong visual connection with the cemetery and has broad views over the pastoral landscape to the east. The Belgenny group comprises an important collection of tenant cottages and timber farm buildings. This community is an exemplar of early Australian construction in timber. This zone includes the adjacent Dairy No. 2, timber calf pens and remnant exotic plantings. Zone 19 is where Belgenny Farm started and many early 19th century buildings have survived intact due to a conservation program designed by Howard Tanner and Associates Pty Ltd during the 1980s. Timber is the main building material used for construction at Belgenny Farm. The buildings are stabilised and well conserved with little replacement to the original structures. Originally a small hut was constructed on the ridge at Belgenny Farm and was occupied by the Macarthurs between 1801 and 1817. A small stone monument marks the site not far from the present Belgenny Cottage. Belgenny Cottage was built in several stages, the earliest dating c. 1819. The original structure is located in the middle section of the current day cottage and was occupied by John Macarthur until his death in 1834 (in front of the fire) and was occupied by the family until 1835. The original section is the oldest surviving part and is made from brick nog, a very early form of construction. Original roof shingles remain beneath the iron. The cottage would originally have had packed earth floors, raised floorboards were a later addition. To accommodate the inward-opening doors, the raised floor had to have the \\"cut out\\" seen today. After John's death the cottage served as a manager's residence and later as an office (until the early 1970s), thus it had many alterations. The rear section is a \\"Hudson ready cut\\" or \\"kit\\" house, erected in 1920 on the foundations of an older building.undated 'Belgenny Farm: historical walking tour brochure. Other structures within Belgenny Farm are the stables c. 1826, the creamery (originally built as a coach house c. 1820s then operated as a creamery between 1900 and 1928), the slaughterhouse, the carpenters' building from the 1840s and the blacksmith's shop c.1930s. A number of important remnant historic plantings remain on the Belgenny Estate such as the English oak (Quercus robur) located on the northern side of Belgenny Farm. This was planted by John Macarthur from an acorn he collected in 1789 from an Elizabeth Farm planting (now dead). It is the oldest surviving English oak tree in Australia. Originally, two dovecotes were located on the farm and were believed to have housed pigeons that flew messages between Belgenny and Elizabeth Farm. Today, only one survives. The old oak tree (Quercus robur) to the cottage's south-west is reputed to be the oldest oak tree in Australia. It was supposedly grown from an acorn picked up in one of the English Royal Estates (undated 'Belgenny Farm: historical walking tour brochure). Adjacent to the 1920s addition to Belgenny Farm located near the remaining dovecote may be the site of the original Macarthur garden. In 1993, remnant root stock and stumps of the original roses from this garden survived and new shoots were being nurtured. Immediately south of the homestead is a multi-stemmed kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum) In spite of its old scar tissue from livestock damage, it is one of the healthiest and finest specimens of this species within the municipality and may be a remnant of the original woodland. Along the southern boundary fence are remnants of an old mulberry (Morus alba) grove. William Macarthur planted the first mulberry trees and may have been attempting to develop an early silk industry, since mulberry trees are a primary food source for silk worms. Descendants of the original mulberry plantings are located in paddocks along the western side of the blacksmith's shop and along the private road. The small (token) vineyard planting of 500 grape vines (in five varieties) on the site of the horse yards/paddocks, is to commemorate the first commercial vineyard and winery in Australia, established at Camden Park in 1820, (experimental planting) and in full swing by 1830. William Macarthur is credited with the work of the vineyard. On the south are vines grown in the traditional method of the early 1800s, and on the left vines on the modern trellis system. In 1821 the Macarthurs built Belgenny Farm House, a timber 'cottage ornée' designed by Henry Kitchen. Kitchen also designed Hambledon Cottage at Elizabeth Farm, the family's estate at Parramatta, and a series of unbuilt mansions for their Pyrmont estate and Camden Park itself. The original cottage was later demolished and replaced by a poorly configured structure that led several architectural historians to mistakenly decry Kitchen's capacity as an architect. This later structure and the original related outbuildings, known as the 'Camden Park Home Farm', form one of the oldest surviving groups of farm structures in Australia. In 1832, after Macarthur had finally decided to make Camden the 'family seat', he commissioned architect John Verge to design a house of a stature suitable for one of the colony's leading and wealthiest families; previous designers employed by Macarthur included Edward Smith and Henry Cooper. The house was completed in 1835, shortly after John Macarthur's death in 1834. Sons James and William Macarthur took up occupancy in the new house, while their mother Elizabeth continued to reside at Elizabeth Farm at Parramatta, in which she had a life interest. ;Zone 20River Zone 20 is significant as it enabled early farm development in the region. This zone consists of the river and accompanying vegetation which has become despoiled on the banks through sand and soil mining. This has resulted in the banks becoming destabilised, causing weed infestation and a reduction in water quality. The spread of weed species has resulted in a loss of the river's role as a visual site boundary and wildlife corridor. Where the vegetation cover remains intact, a discrete corridor atmosphere is provided. ;Rotolactor \\"Seven miles out of Campbelltown, adjacent to the main Southern Railway at Menangle, the Camden Park Estate P/L has installed a Rotolactor which is designed to milk 2500 cows twice daily. A steel platform, in diamenter is mounted on 20 steel wheels and revolves on two circular railways which rest on concrete walls above the basement floor. The machinery is mounted underneath and revolves with the platform. An inclined ramp leads from the holding yards. The cows approach in correct order and enter slowly. As the platform revolves, milking commences using standard vacuum milking machines. After one revolution, the cows return to the holding yard via a ramp under the platform. Around the moving platform, the milk is collected in vacuum steel containers then emptied into a dump vat, pumped to the depot and within 90 seconds is chilled and ready for despatch to Sydney. All cows on Camden Park are tested annually for tuberculosis (TB). All milk is guaranteed to be free from this disease. There is no charge for visitors and a milk bar operates at weekends or for organised parties when advice is given\\".Transcribed from GREGORY'S 100 MILES AROUND SYDNEY, 26TH EDITION (1967).  Condition  As at 30 July 2003, conservation during the 1980s by NSW Agriculture has enabled the timber structures to be preserved and many interpretative qualities remain intact. Belgenny Farm has high archaeological potential relative to historical landscapes and built structures. The surrounding landscape, scenic views and remnant plantings are considerably intact and play a primary role in maintaining the integrity of the estate and adjoining landscapes Camden Park & Belgenny Farm Estate in particular has retained its integrity and intactness due to best practice conservation techniques.  Modifications and dates  *Since 1989 a new access road has been constructed, beginning from the east of the farm buildings and terminating at a visitor car park located at the northern end of the site. A timber and lattice structure has been built at the entry point to the estate and additional planting of avenue and screening trees has been developed. A \\"country style\\" garden has been landscaped around Reception Cottage and a demonstration vineyard to the north-east of the site has been established. *In 2000 / 2001 Wollondilly Council prepared a Local Government Environmental Plan and Development Control Plan concerning a land release area at South Camden, on the western edge of Camden Park Estate's valley. The Heritage Office was involved in specifying controls to minimise the visual impact of housing on the valley. *2003-5 west of the Navigation Creek valley new urban development is in the process of being developed, the \\"Bridgewater Estate\\" development (on what was formerly the Dog Trap Paddock of the early estate). This continues the residential development of the suburb of Elizabeth Macarthur along Remembrance Drive. Apart from the prominent Camden Park Reservoir cylinder new houses are now highly visible from the central northern part of the EMAI lands. Other recent residential development is visible from the site to the south of Woodbridge Road, and west of Mount Taurus.Britton, 2005 *2005 a new Dairy complex is under construction over the Upper Navigation Creek Valley featuring the use of innovative technology. *2013: Old Orchard (EMAI): The orchard is depleted of fruit trees (I was told by an (EMAI) employee, Christine that all of the apple trees except one were grubbed out for an apple and pear bounty in decades past, the last one was much later felled by lightning). No deciduous magnolias were found. A few oak trees (Quercus spp.) remain but some looked senescent. A cork oak (Q.suber) looked splendid although some nearby eucalypts might threaten it in due course. Three old camellias were present and one other was dead. All were (Camellia) japonicas and one of the three survivors had the characteristic brown sepals of the descendants of \\"Anemoniflora\\" which William Macarthur used as a seed parent. Maybe it will prove to be \\"Mariana\\". One would need to look in winter or early spring. As for magnolias, two clones of Magnolia grandiflora (bull bay/evergreen or southern magnolia) were present. Both are large and very old - one has improved its prospects for durability but sending down low branches to help anchor it against gales (see picture with Christine, an EMAI employee) whereas the other has started vigorously sending up root suckers. (Several photos sent, filed in objective file).Neil Mitchell, personal communication, 5/3/2013  Further information  Belgenny Farm has a depth and complexity of cultural engagement and botanical history spanning two centuries of European settlement. It provides an important perspective on some of the most productive periods of the Camden Park Estate.  Camden Park appearances in film  An iconic colonial house with large gardens and intact interiors, Camden Park has appeared several times in film and advertising, including the following: *The 'Smiley' films (1956, 1958) which starred Chips Rafferty and Ralph Richardson, scenes from which were also filmed in the Camden area. *The 1979 adaptation of Australian novelist Miles Franklin's 1901 novel My Brilliant Career as Five Bob Downs, the house of Harry Beecham. Notable scenes that feature the house and its contents include a formal dinner in the large dining room and a pillow fight between the central character Sybylla Melvyn, played by Judy Davis, and her potential husband Harry (Sam Neill) that proceeds down the house's main staircase, through the garden and along a long arbour known as the 'clivia walk', finishing on a grassed section below the rear lawn known as 'Blarney Bank'. *Both exterior and interior scenes of Julia Leigh's film Sleeping Beauty (2011), starring Emily Browning, were filmed at the house, notably in the library and along the entrance drive where tall hedges of plumbago and bay create a shaded theatrical contrast to the brightly lit western front of the house with its Tuscan portico.  Heritage listing  As at 10 March 2006, the Camden Park Estate is of social, historic, scientific and aesthetic significance to NSW and Australia. It shows a high degree of technical and creative excellence being a rare, and still relatively intact, example of a model rural estate of the early 19th century (continuing to serve this function until the 1950s). It is the oldest pastoral sheep stud in Australia. The estate's considerable social and historic significance is also due to its ability to demonstrate the way of life, tastes, customs and functions of a 19th - early 20th century rural establishment. From its establishment the site was a particularly fine example of a colonial rural estate and served as a prototype for other 19th century estates. The intactness of the site's structures and their landscape settings enhances its role as a relatively unique survivor and as a site of archaeological and scientific importance.LEP/ Heritage Study The site also has significance through its historical associations with the Macarthur family - from its establishment by John and Elizabeth Macarthur in the early 19th century to the present day Macarthur-Stanham family - this relationship shown in both landscape and structures and being well documented and researched. By the 1830s the estate of included the greatest and most advanced mixed farm in NSW, at a time when Australian wools had almost ousted continental wools from British usage and the British manufacturers had a vast ascendancy in the world's woollen marketsCamden Park Estate, 1965 Its extensive grounds planted in the tradition of 19th century English landscape parks holds a major botanical collection and its large, exceptional collection of rural buildings is especially important because of both the quality and rarity of the group. The Camden Park orchard site and cottages area contains the remnants of an early commercial and scientific horticultural collection which was established by William Macarthur and made a contribution to commercial horticulture in NSW and other colonies such as South Australia. The cottages are an integral part of the orchard complex which continued to function commercially until for 150 years and are important 19th century elements of the landscape. Camden Park played a vital role in the fledgling Australian wine industry through its importation and distribution of vine cuttings throughout NSW and the Barossa Valley of SA. By 1853 Camden Park listed some 33 grape varieties for sale. (By 1841 William & James were producing more than and that vintage won Gold Medals in England. In 1844 24,000 vine cuttings were sent from Camden Park to Adelaide, setting South Australia on a path to becoming an internationally acclaimed wine growing district. Camden Park became world-renowned for the quality of its wine and by 1845 was producing around per annum as a serious vineyard and one of the most highly regarded in the colony and with quite a reputation overseas. James & William Macarthur managed the estate with great enterprise, importing expert workers: Australia's first skilled wool-sorter from Silesia, shepherds from Scotland, vignerons from Nassau and dairymen from Dorset. They installed the first irrigation plant in Australia in 1830 and the first sheep wash and wool press. After changes of soil and climate in 1849 dictated sale of their merino stud, wheat was the stable until the mid 1860s. But rust and labour shortage led to a change to mixed farming - sheep and cattle fattening, mixed grains, wine, horses for India until 1857, and Australia's largest plant and tree nursery. The 2000 specimens of plants, shrubs and trees included the country's premier collections of domestic orchids and camellias, both of which William Macarthur was one of the first to introduce into Australia. Two vineyards were planted in 1830 and 1841 and produced up to a year including choice vintages, with as much as in cellar sometimes. In 1832 the estate exported the first Australian brandy, and had 8 vintage and fortified wines varying from Muscat to Riesling at the Paris Exhibition of 1861. Also in the 1830s William Macarthur pioneered processes of drying fruit, \\"with which the British Isles were unacquainted\\". In 1857 Camden Park had a variety of all normal species of orchard fruits and nuts, 56 varieties of apple including cider making types, 31 kinds of pear, 23 citrus fruit varieties including Navel oranges, 16 table grapes apart from 32 wine varieties. Apricots, plums, cherries, quinces, figs, chestnuts, almonds and strawberries were also grown on the estate.Camden Park Estate, 1965, modified Read, S., 2004 The Camden Park garden and nursery is historically important as part of the original Macarthur family Camden estate. The garden is significant for its demonstration of the early nineteenth century estate garden design, including the following: The use of a hill site to take advantage of the views; the use of plantings to enframe views; and the planting of trees with ornamental form, demonstrating the influence of the early nineteenth century horticultural movement. The area has historical significance as the original Macarthur nursery renowned for the introduction and propagation of exotic plants in early Australia. Significant features include the following: the area of olive and plumbago shrubbery; the brick edged gravel carriage loop; structured vistas from the house entrance and garden entrance; specimen plants of araucarias and camellias reputed to be the oldest in Australia; well blended later additions of herbaceous beds and rose garden; and ruins of the gardener's lodge, potting sheds and hothouses from the original nursery period.Register of the National Estate, 1978 Finally the estate is of major landscape and environmental significance as a significant area of open space lining the Nepean River with landmark landscape features including the tree lined river meadows, ridge top Belgenny Farm Group, the driveways and the relic orchard and plantations site on the flood plain north-east of the mansion. Camden Park House is of historic and aesthetic significance as one of the finest of the nation's early 19th century country homesteads. More particularly it is an outstanding exemplar of Australia's Colonial Regency style of architecture, this significance being enhanced by the quality of the design and craftsmanship and the degree to which it has retained important original fabric and features. The building is generally regarded as one of architect John Verge's finest achievements. The house's historic significance is also due in large measure to its role as the home of the Macarthur family from the days of John and Elizabeth, through a direct line of descendants to the present.State Heritage Inventory Public Presentation report, modified Stuart Read, 09/2004 Belgenny Farm and Camden Park Estate has historical, aesthetic, social and technical/research significance at local, state and national levels as the oldest, intact, rural landscape and group of farm buildings in Australia, with close associations with the Macarthur family. Belgenny Farm and Camden Park Estate was instrumental and influential in the development of this country's agricultural, pastoral, horticultural and viticultural industries. It is both representative of the evolution of many rural industrial technologies and a rare example of a remnant colonial farm within the Cumberland Plain where many of its scenic qualities have survived intact. Belgenny Farm and Camden Park Estate has important associations with key figures in the history of New South Wales, particularly John and Elizabeth Macarthur, their sons James and William, and Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow. As an unusually intact record of farm building construction techniques and rural technological change, Belgenny Farm and Camden Park Estate has enormous educational and interpretive potential for current and future generations of Australians. Aesthetically, Camden Park Estate is in a setting of bucolic charm, symbolic plantings and important vistas with the added significance of the Macarthur family cemetery with its monuments and Belgenny Farm's timber vernacular buildings. The entire estate is considered to be an ongoing agricultural property of social significance.

History of the Shamlu tribe Pre-Safavid era Among the Qizilbash, Turcoman tribes from Eastern Anatolia and Azerbaijan who had helped Shah Ismail I defeat the Aq Qoyunlu tribe were by far the most important - in number and influence. Therefore the name Kizilbash is usually applied to them only. Some of these greater Turcoman tribes were subdivided into as many as eight or nine clans and included the: * Ustādjlu * Rumlu * Shāmlu (the most powerful clan during the reign of Shah Ismail I.) * Dulghadir (Arabic: Dhu 'l-Kadar) * Afshār * Qājār * Takkalu Other tribes, such as Turkman, Bahārlu, Qaramānlu, Warsāk or Bayāt were occasionally listed among these \\"seven great uymaqs\\". Some of these names consist of a place-name with addition of the Turkish suffix -lu, such as Shāmlu or Bahārlu. Other names are those of old Oghuz tribes such as Afshār, Dulghadir, or Bayāt, as mentioned by the medieval Uyghur historian Mahmoud Al-Kāshgharī. The origin of the name Ustādjlu, however, is unknown and possibly indicates a non-Turkic origin of the tribe. The non-Turkic or non-Turkish-speaking Iranian tribes among the Kizilbash were called Tājiks by the Turcomans and included: * Tālish * Siāh-Kuh (Karādja- Dagh) * Lur tribes (for example the Zand) * certain Kurdish tribes * certain Persian families and clans The rivalry between the Turkic clans and Persian nobles was a major problem in the Safavid kingdom and caused much trouble. As V. Minorsky put it, friction between these two groups was inevitable, because the Turcomans \\"were no party to the national Persian tradition\\". Shah Ismail tried to solve the problem by appointing Persian wakils as commanders of Kizilbash tribes. However, the Turcomans considered this an insult and brought about the death of 3 of the 5 Persians appointed to this office - an act, that later inspired the deprivation of the Turcomans by Shah Abbas I. Safavid era The Beginnings In the 15th century, Ardabil was the center of an organization designed to keep the Safavid leadership in close touch with its murids in Azerbaijan, Iraq, eastern Anatolia, and elsewhere. The organization was controlled through the office of khalīfāt al-khulafā'ī who appointed representatives (khalīfa) in regions where Safavid propaganda was active. The khalīfa, in turn, had subordinates termed pira. Their presence in eastern Anatolia posed a serious threat to the Ottomans, because they encouraged the Shi'ite population of Asia Minor to revolt against the sultan. In 1499, Ismail, the young leader of the Safavid order, left Lahijan for Ardabil to make his bid for power. By the summer of 1500, ca. 7,000 supporters from the local Turcoman tribes of Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq - collectively called \\"Kizilbash\\" by their enemies - rallied to his support. Leading his troops on a punitive campaign against the Shīrvanshāh (ruler of Shirvan), he sought revenge for the death of his father and his grandfather in Shīrvan. After defeating the Shīrvanshāh Farrukh Yassar, he moved south into Azarbaijan where his 7,000 Kizilbash warriors defeated a force of 30,000 Ak Koyunlu under Alwand Mirzā, and conquered Tabriz. This was the beginning of the Safavid state. In the first decade of the 16th century, the Kizilbash expanded Safavid rule over the rest of Persia, as well as Baghdad and Iraq, formerly under Ak Koyunlu control. In 1510 Shah Ismail sent a large force of the Kizilbash to Transoxania to support the Timurid ruler Babur in his war against the Uzbeks. The Kizilbash defeated the Uzbeks and secured Samarqand for Babur. However, in 1512, an entire Kizilbash army was annihilated by the Uzbeks after Turcoman Kizilbash had mutinied against their Persian wakil and commander, Amir Nadjm. This heavy defeat put an end to Safavid expansion and influence in Transoxania and the northeastern frontiers of the kingdom remained vulnerable to nomad invasions. The Battle of Chaldiran Meanwhile, the Safavid da'wa (propaganda) continued in Ottoman areas - with great success. Even more alarming for the Ottomans was the successful conversion of Turcoman tribes in eastern Anatolia and Iraq, and the recruitment of these well experienced and feared fighters into the growing Safavid army. In order to stop the Safavid propaganda, Sultan Bayezid II deported large numbers of the Shi'ite population of Asia Minor to Morea. However, in 1507, Shah Ismail and the Kizilbash overran large areas of Kurdistan, defeating regional Ottoman forces. Only two years later in Central Asia, the Kizilbash defeated the Uzbeks at Merv, killing their leader Muhammad Shaybani and destroying his dynasty. His head was sent to the Ottoman sultan as a warning. In 1511, an Alevi revolt known as \\"Shahkulu Uprising\\" broke out in Teke and was brutally suppressed by the Ottomans: 40,000 were massacred on the order of the sultan. Shah Ismail sought to turn the chaos within the Ottoman Empire to his advantage and invaded Anatolia. The Kizilbash defeated a large Ottoman army under Sinan Pasha. Shocked by this heavy defeat, Sultan Selim I (the new ruler of the Empire) decided to invade Persia with a force of 200,000 Ottomans and face the Kizilbash on their own soil. In addition, he ordered the persecution of Shiism and the massacre of all its adherents in the Ottoman Empire. On the 20 August 1514 (1st Rajab 920 A.H.), the two armies met at Chaldiran in Azarbaijan. The Ottomans outnumbered the Kizilbash two to one (according to other sources: three to one) and had artillery and handguns. The Kizilbash were heavily defeated,[15] and many high-ranking Kizilbash amirs as well as three influential figures of the ulamā were killed. The defeat destroyed Shah Ismail's belief in his invincibility and his divine status. It also fundamentally altered the relationship between the murshid-e kāmil and his murids. Shah Abbas's Reforms In 1588, Shah Abbas I came to power. He appointed the Governor of Herat and his former guardian and tutor, Alī Quli Khān Shāmlū (also known as Hājī Alī Qizilbāsh Mazandarānī) the chief of all the armed forces. Later on, events of the past, including the role of the Turcomans in the succession struggles after the death of his father, and the counterbalancing influence of traditional Ithnāʻashari Shia Sayeds, made him determined to end the dominance of the untrustworthy Turcoman chiefs in Persia. In order to weaken the Turcomans - the important militant elite of the Safavid kingdom - Shah Abbas raised a standing army from the ranks of the ghilman who were usually ethnic Armenians and Georgians. The new army would be loyal to the king personally and not to clan-chiefs anymore.

Publication history The preface to the first volume of the work, written by , a minor artist of Nagoya, suggests that the publication of the work may be aided by Hokusai's pupils. Part of the preface reads:Michener, p. 13 The final volume is considered spurious by some art historians.Hillier, p. 100 Sources of the Manga A page from the Manga, showing people with their faces hidden Hokusai Manga depicting self-defense techniques (early 19th century) The traditional view holds that, after the outburst of production, Hokusai carefully selected and redrew the sketches, arranging them into the patterns we see today. However, Michener (1958:30-34) argues that the pattern of the images on a particular plate were arranged by the wood carvers and publishers, not by the artist himself. Legacy The first volume of 'Manga' (Defined by Hokusai as 'Brush gone wild'), was an art instruction book published to aid his troubled finances. Shortly after he removed the text and republished it.'The Floating World of Hokusai': BBC Radio 4, broadcast 10:30am (UTC) 30 Aug 2012 The Manga evidence a dedication to artistic realism in portrayal of people and the natural world. The work was an immediate success, and the subsequent volumes soon followed. The work became known to the West since Philipp Franz von Siebold's lithographed paraphrases of some of the sketches appeared in his Nippon: Archiv Zur Beschreibung von Japon in 1831. The work began to circulate in the West soon after Matthew C. Perry's entry into Japan in 1854.Hillier, p. 107 and 110 Notes References *Bouquillard, Jocelyn and Marquet, Christopher (2007).

Diversicon provides programming and social opportunities to encourage the multicultural, multimedia exploration and celebration of SF by those within and outside of the traditional SF community. Diversicon includes both live and posthumous guests. It is sponsored by SF Minnesota. Programming Diversicon's programming—typically three simultaneous tracks—focuses on literature but also includes items related to film, TV, comics, art, science, and other subjects. Science fiction, fantasy, horror, and slipstream/magic realism genres are all represented. Programming topics are solicited from preregistered attendees.Diversicon 16 Media Guide . 2008. \\"Profile: Diversicon and SF Minnesota co-founder, past convention chair, and Diversicon 16 programming chair Eric M. Heideman.\\" p. 4. Programming items often focus on authors and/or fictional characters from underrepresented groups; how work deals with themes of race, ethnicity, class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, dis/ability, and other definitions of \\"difference\\"; and how contemporary issues around diversity influence the reading and writing of SF. Most programming items are panel discussions. In addition, guests of honor are interviewed and participate in Q&A; with the audience. Other formats include roundtable discussions, film screenings, informational presentations/workshops, and concerts. The convention includes an Art Show; displaying artists are encouraged to attend and be available to discuss their work with attendees. It also includes a Dealers' Room where various jewelry, books, magazines, clothing/accessories, and other items are for sale. The ConSuite is a room with comfortable, informal seating and light food and drink. Parties are held each evening. Diversicon 15 Media Guide . 2008. \\"Diversicon 16: A preview.\\" p. 6.

History Diversicon 16 Media Guide . 2008. \\"Diversicon: A brief history.\\" p. 2. Diversicon is sponsored by SF Minnesota, a nonprofit organization. SF Minnesota was founded in February 1992 by a group that wanted to create a Twin Cities speculative fiction convention with a different tone and focus from what already existed. They decided that Diversicon would celebrate and explore the connections between speculative fiction (SF) and diversity, particularly in three areas: * Cultural diversity. Slightly more than two thirds of Diversicon's guest professionals have been women. A number of guests have been persons of color. A number of guests have been openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual and/or have written SF that explores issues of alternate sexuality. * Diversity of fan groups. Diversicon would be openly welcoming, friendly, and respectful to the wide range of SF-related organizations in the area, ranging from book clubs to writing groups, Star Trek and anime clubs, creative anachronists and futurist organizations, and anyone else who shared an interest in diversity and the imagination. * Diversity in media. Recognizing that different people come to SF through different paths, Diversicon would be inclusive of all media. In addition to a strong core of literary programming—including items for both writers and readers—the convention also includes a rich sampling of panels and discussions related to SF in film, TV, graphic arts, and other media as well as speculative science. Diversicon 1 premiered in June 1993 and subsequently settled on August as its regular month. The convention hosted the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 2000.

Patient education can include explaining the results of diagnostic tests. Patient education is the process by which health professionals and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status. Overview Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training. Health education is also a tool used by managed care plans, and may include both general preventive education or health promotion and disease or condition specific education.Peter R. Koongstvedt, \\"The Managed Health Care Handbook,\\" Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved. It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. The value of patient education can be summarized as follows: *Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability. *Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition. *Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them. *Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply. *Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications. *Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need. *Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits. *Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients. *Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.Patient Education Institute, Research evidence The competencies of a health educator include the following: *Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others. *Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care. *Practice preventive health care. *Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families. *Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care. *Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society. *Use technology appropriately and effectively. *Be current in the field and continue to advance education. There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment. * For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation. * In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving overall patient health. * In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, patient education has been shown as an effective non-pharmacological treatment.

He is also known as a long time stage manager for the Metropolitan Opera and is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame Youth Kuntner immigrated to the U.S. with his family when he was seven. His family settled in the New York City area where he began playing soccer. However, he was an all around athlete and played baseball, football, basketball and tennis at Gorton High School in Yonkers, New York. Professional soccer Kuntner signed with the New York Giants of the American Soccer League during the 1927–1928 season. He played five games, all in the second half of the season, scoring three goals. In 1928, he moved to the New York Hungaria in the short lived Eastern Soccer League. After the collapse of the ESL in 1929, Kuntner moved to First Vienna (also known as Wiener Sports Club and New York Vienna F.C.) of the German American Soccer League. In 1930, he was back in the ASL with Bridgeport Hungaria, but the team moved to Newark after ten games, then folded. He then moved to the New York Giants of the American Soccer League (ASL). The Giants folded in 1932 and Kuntner moved to New York Americans of the second ASL. In 1937, the Americans fell in the National Challenge Cup final to St. Louis Shamrocks. In 1939, he was playing with Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic when it won the National Cup final over Chicago Manhattan Beer.U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF Kuntner was still going strong in the 1942–1943 season when he scored nine goals in seventeen games with Brookhattan. In 1945, he was still active with Brookhattan when it won the triple, the league title, Lewis Cup (league cup) and National Challenge Cup. National and Olympic teams Kuntner earned two caps with the U.S. national team in 1928. At the time, the Olympic soccer games counted as full internationals and his first cap with the national team came in the 1928 Summer Olympics. That game, an 11–2 loss to Argentina saw Kuntner score in his debut with the national team. Following the tournament, the team traveled to Poland where it tied the Polish national team 3–3. Kuntner again scored, joining a handful of U.S. players who scored in their first two international games.The Official Site of U.S. Soccer – Men's National Team Despite his scoring success, Kuntner was never again called into the national team. Metropolitan Opera In addition to his success on the soccer field, Kuntner found great success as a stage hand at the Metropolitan Opera. He began as an electrician, but over the years moved into areas of greater responsibility including lighting and stage management. According to the Soccer Hall of Fame profile, he \\"received wide acclaim for his role in the staging of Tristan and Isolde in 1971.\\" In 1963, Kuntner was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

Through the generosity of Frankfurter Joseph Hoch, who bequeathed the Conservatory one million German gold marks in his testament, a school for music and the arts was established for all age groups. Instrumental to the foundation, prosperity and success of the conservatory was its director Joachim Raff who did most of the work including setting the entire curriculum and hiring all its faculty. It has played an important role in the history of music in Frankfurt. Clara Schumann taught piano, as one of distinguished teachers in the late 19th century, gaining international renown for the conservatory. In the 1890s, about 25% of the students came from other countries: 46 were from England and 23 from the United States. In the 1920s, under director Bernhard Sekles, the conservatory was far ahead of its time: Sekles initiated the world's first Jazz Studies (directed by Mátyás Seiber) and in 1931 the Elementary Music Department. Dr. Hoch's conservatory offers instruction in the Music Education for Youth and Adults (ANE) program, the Elementary Music Department (Basisabteilung), and the Pre-College-Frankfurt (PCF) program, which provides preparation for future studies at a Hochschule or conservatory. There are also Ballet, Early Music and New Music departments. The following qualifications are available: Bachelor of Music in Performance and Pedagogy in all instruments, voice, music theory, composition, performance and Elementary Music Pedagogy.

Gilbert Westacott Reynolds (10 October 1895 Bendigo - 7 April 1967 Mbabane), was a South African optometrist and authority on the genus Aloe. Gilbert Reynolds arrived in Johannesburg with his parents in 1902, where his father started business as an optician. He received his education at St John's College where he was Victor Ludorum. After the outbreak of World War I he enlisted and saw active service in South West Africa and Nyasaland with the rank of captain. Having qualified as optometrist he joined his father's practice in 1921. Reynolds developed a keen interest in the bulbs and succulents of South Africa at about this time. When he started his own country practice about 1930, he was able to travel extensively and gradually narrowed his interests to Aloe. Reynolds was guided in the early stages of his research by Dr I. C. Verdoorn and Dr R. A. Dyer of the Botanical Research Institute in Pretoria, later becoming the authority on Aloe and having an extensive knowledge of the genus in the field and under cultivation. To gather material for his book, he explored the entire country, collecting specimens, gathering data and taking photographs of the plants in their natural habitats. General Smuts, himself an avid collector and experienced botanist, wrote the foreword to the book. Before the publication of Reynolds' work, no comprehensive guide to the aloes had been compiled, except for various writings and monographs which did not attempt a complete coverage. He spent four weeks at Kew towards the end of 1960, checking the taxonomy, type specimens and identifications.Germishuizen, G. and Glen, G.

It was built in 2004 by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The original Lexington Bridge was built in 1965 as part of the proposed construction of Interstate 35E. However, the bridge did not see much use for a while, because I-35E was not completed between Lilydale and Burnsville until the mid-1980s. Construction of I-35E between Minnesota State Highway 5, just north of the bridge, and Interstate 94 in downtown St. Paul was not finished until the early 1990s. The increase in traffic caused the old bridge to deteriorate faster than expected. As a result of deterioration, and a need to carry more traffic, the old bridge was replaced. The staging of this construction project was notable for keeping four lanes of traffic open during the process. A new span was built on the west side of the bridge, and then traffic was detoured to the new southbound span and the old southbound span. The old northbound span was demolished, and a new northbound span was built. When this was completed, the old southbound span was demolished, and the inner two lanes of the new bridge were completed. The bridge has an anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather. This is part of a test to see if measured application of chemicals can prolong the life of a structure, as compared to the usual liberal application of sodium chloride salt.

From 2013 to 2017, the auditorium was the home to Britney Spears's concert residency Piece of Me and Justin Timberlake's annual concert to benefit the Shriners Hospitals for Children. In 2011, it was voted as one of the \\"Best Concert Halls & Theaters In Las Vegas\\". History While this location was known as the Aladdin Hotel, the owners decided to create a performing arts center to replace the mildly used golf course. Planning began in 1969, with concepts showing the venue as a separate building. In 1972, the hotel was sold to Sam Diamond, Peter Wevve, Sorkis Wevve and Richard Daly. The center opened on July 2, 1976 (America's bicentennial weekend), with Neil Diamond, who was paid $750,000 for five sold- out shows. During the 1970s and 1980s, the auditorium became a staple on the Strip for many rock and roll acts. During the hotel's financial troubles in the 1990s, the center became its main revenue stream. In 1998, the venue closed while the original Aladdin Hotel was imploded. During the renovation, the center's original structure was removed, incorporating the venue into the casino area of the hotel. In 2000, the venue reopened with a performance by Enrique Iglesias, with a capacity decrease to 7,000. Due to the additions of the MGM Grand Garden Arena and Mandalay Bay Events Center, the venue was used infrequently by music acts. In 2004, the venue made international news when spectators walked out of a Linda Ronstadt concert while expressing support for filmmaker Michael Moore. In 2010, the center saw a resurgence in use, hosting at least 15 concerts annually. The theater was the host of the Miss Universe 1991, 1996, 2012, 2015 and 2017 pageants, several Miss USA pageants and several Miss America pageants. On June 28, 2012, the auditorium was renamed to the \\"PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino\\". On December 19, 2013, the venue was renamed \\"The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino\\". It was also announced that American entertainment company Live Nation Entertainment would take over operations and management of the venue from BASE Entertainment. The AXIS theatre has been home to headlining concert residencies such as Justin Timberlake & Friends, Paris By Night and Britney: Piece of Me, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life and Christina Aguilera: The Xperience The venue's name was changed to Zappos Theater in February 2018, as part of a five-year marketing deal with online shoe retailer Zappos.

Career Early career In 1996 Zhang Shuai would leave home and move to Beijing to start his football career where he would eventually gain a place at the Beijing Guoan youth team and then eventually promotion to their senior team. After breaking into the Beijing squad he would be called up to the Chinese youth team, however his off-the field antics did not go down well with the management especially his nights out clubbing with his teammates, which saw him dropped from the team. Returning to Beijing he would go on to establish himself within the squad and by the 2003 league season he would aid the team to win the 2003 Chinese FA Cup. After achieving success with Beijing Zhang Shuai was given a drugs test during the off season on 22 December 2003, which he failed and was given a three-month ban for testing positive for the banned substance ephedrine. He became the first Chinese player ever to be banned for using drugs in football and was personally fined an undisclosed amount. Zhang claimed his innocence by saying he accidentally took the substance for a remedy to his cold, however his apologies were not enough for the Chinese youth team and they permanently dropped him from their squad once more. Beijing Guoan stuck by him and he would surprisingly miss very little of the 2004 league season and would even go on to win the 2004 Chinese Super Cup at the end of the season. Retirement Zhang Shuai's career would go from strength to strength, winning his first senior international cap for China against Thailand in a friendly on May 16, 2007 in a 1–0 defeat where despite the defeat his performance was good enough for him to become a regular within the squad and go to the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. His career drastically changed when he had a terrible performance against Shanghai Shenhua in a game, which saw him make a dreadful mistake that lead to a Shanghai goal. This saw him to being forced into the reserve team and frozen out of the squad, Zhang would later announce that he decided to retire from association football because of this unfair punishment.

Kennedy (April 8, 1987 – May 16, 2007) was a young gay American man who was severely punched by a younger man, Stephen Andrew Moller as Sean was leaving a bar in Greenville, South Carolina. The punch was so hard that it shattered his facial bones and separated his brain from his brain stem. He fell to the ground, and his killer drove off leaving Sean dying on the ground. Sean William Kennedy died 17 hours later of his fatal injuries. This attack and Kennedy's death drew attention to South Carolina's lack of a hate crime law and is believed to have contributed to passage of the federal Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2009, for which his mother lobbied. Additionally, Moller served so little time \\"because of the lack of an applicable Violent Crime Law in South Carolina\\" at the time, according to the Judge, although this explanation was seen by the LGBT community as merely thinly veiled homophobia. Stephen Andrew Moller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in causing Kennedy's death. He was sentenced to five years, suspended to three years and counting time already served. He was released on parole July 1, 2009. Death On May 16, 2007, at about 3:45 am, Kennedy was leaving a local bar in Greenville. A car pulled up beside him, and Moller got out and approached Kennedy. He punched him hard enough to break facial bones. Kennedy fell and hit the asphalt, resulting in his brain separating from his brain stem and ricocheting in his skull. Kennedy later died of his injuries. Stephen Andrew Moller, age eighteen, was charged with involuntary manslaughter of Sean Kennedy. The warrant stated that the act was \\"a result of the defendant (Moller) not liking the sexual identity of the victim.\\"Paul Hyde, \\"Community rallies against hate, intolerance\\", Greenville News, 6 June 2007 Pre-trial In November 2007, Moller was released to home detention upon paying a $25,000 bond. He was required to stay with his mother until his trial. The charge of murder was reduced to involuntary manslaughter because 1. there was no conscious premeditated desire to kill Kennedy and 2. the state law does not have a between murder and involuntary manslaughter. Unable to secure a conviction for murder, the prosecuting attorneys opted for involuntary manslaughter in order to get the violent activity onto Moller's record. The sentence carries a 0–5 years prison term, and Moller was released on July 1, 2009.Stephen Moller released week early QNotes Gay Charlotte and LGBT Carolina News, Arts & Entertainment Sentencing On June 11, 2008, Moller appeared at a plea hearing (a no-jury trial). He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to five years, suspended to three years, including the 199 days he served in county jail before he was released on bond. At the sentencing, Moller denied that his attack was a hate crime, claiming that he did not know Kennedy's sexual orientation prior to the attack. This explanation was contradicted by eyewitnesses. Moller received a 2-month credit for working on getting his GED and was released 7 days early on July 1, 2009, after having served 12 months in prison. All releases generally occur on the first of the month, according to the department of parole in South Carolina.Gay Man's Killer Released After 1 Year WYFF Home - WYFF Home Moller was on probation for 3 years and ordered to take anger management classes, complete 30-days of community service, and to have regular alcohol/drug testing and counseling.

Their function in North American telephony is analogous to that of an individual registrar in the Internet's Domain Name System. RespOrgs were established in 1993 as part of a Federal Communications Commission order instituting toll-free number portability. A RespOrg (pronounced as though it were a single word, something like \\"ressporg\\") can be a long-distance company, reseller, end user or an independent that offers an outsourced service. Theory of operation The initial implementation of toll-free calling was primitive. In the 1950s, a collect call or a call to a Zenith number had to be completed manually by a telephone operator; by 1967, a direct-dial +1-800 number could be provided using Wide Area Telephone Service, but each prefix was tied to a specific geographic destination and each number brought in on special fixed-rate trunks which were priced beyond the reach of most small businesses. There was no means to select between rival carriers and little room for vanity numbering; a subscriber would need three separate numbers to be reachable from Canada, US interstate and US intrastate. A \\"data base communication call processing method\\" patented by Roy P. Weber of Bell Labs (and implemented by AT&T in 1982) broke the link between individual numbers and a specific trunk, city, or carrier. A toll-free number was merely an index into a large, distributed database; any number could geographically be reassigned anywhere merely by changing its database record or sent to one of multiple locations based on the call origin, load balancing between multiple call centers, times, or days. While this data was originally maintained by telephone companies, the breakup of the Bell System in the 1980s and the introduction of toll-free number portability in 1993 required an independent operator to maintain the SMS/800 database. If the Service Management System were a central registry that controlled routing on all toll-free and other telephone numbers, the RespOrgs would be its registrars. Many RespOrgs are telephone companies or long-distance carriers; a toll-free number provided by a carrier is bundled with RespOrg service adequate to send all calls through that one carrier to a single local destination number. A large subscriber with more complex requirements could use an independent RespOrg to direct calls for an individual number to multiple carriers for least-cost routing or to provide disaster recovery. A number that reaches multiple call centers via multiple carriers can be configured to avoid any single point of failure; any change to a number's routing can be propagated throughout the network in fifteen minutes. An independent RespOrg may also hold an advantage in obtaining vanity phonewords by reserving recently disconnected numbers for its clients in the first few seconds after they become available. Regulatory framework In the United States, according to the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the end-user has the right to select their RespOrg and have their numbers transferred to their control. This process is called \\"porting\\" or \\"change of RespOrg\\" and requires a signed letter of authorization from the end-user. Every individual ten-digit toll free telephone number (+1-800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833 area codes, as well as any future toll-free area codes created that share the same characteristics) is managed by a RespOrg. There are approximately 350 RespOrg services, ranging in size from huge incumbent local exchange carriers to companies that control only a few numbers. All RespOrgs operate under the same tariff and are required to follow specific guidelines for this process. The guidelines are maintained by a national industry group known as the SMS/800 Number Administration Committee (SNAC), a committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions. Membership is open to any RespOrg. In theory, regulations prevent hoarding, brokering and warehousing of numbers by both RespOrgs and subscribers. In practice, weak and sporadic enforcement of these regulations allows some RespOrgs to abuse the system to stockpile millions of toll-free numbers for advertising purposes, requiring periodic creation of overlay plan toll-free area codes to prevent exhaustion of the SMS/800 available number pool.

It is also sometimes called \\"pathography.\\" The genre is generally considered to be American in origin, but later became popular in Britain as well. The term misery lit was ostensibly coined by The Bookseller magazine. The genre Works in the genre typically—though not exclusively—begin in the subject's childhood, and very often involve suffering some wrong, physical or sexual abuse, or neglect, perpetrated by an adult authority figure, often a parent. These tales usually culminate in some sort of emotional catharsis, redemption or escape from the abuse or situation. They are often written in the first person. Most critics trace the beginning of the genre to A Child Called \\"It\\", a 1995 memoir by American Dave Pelzer, in which he details the outrageous abuse he claims to have suffered at the hands of his alcoholic mother, and two subsequent books which continue the story. Pelzer's three books—all recovery narratives dealing with his childhood—created considerable controversy, including doubt as to the veracity of the claims. While the books spent a combined total of 448 weeks on the New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list, Pelzer acknowledges purchasing and reselling many thousands of his own books. Jung Chang's Wild Swans (1992) and Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes (1996) are also seen as seminal works establishing the genre. Popularity Misery lit has been described as \\"the book world's biggest boom sector\\". Works in the genre comprised 11 of the top 100 bestselling English paperbacks of 2006, selling nearly two million copies between them. The Waterstone’s chain of British book retailers even instituted a discrete \\"Painful Lives\\" section; Borders followed suit with \\"Real Lives\\". At the W H Smith chain, the section is entitled \\"Tragic Life Stories\\"; in each case side-stepping the dilemma of whether to categorize the books under Fiction or Non-fiction. The readership for these books is estimated to be \\"80% or 90% female\\". Roughly 80% of the sales of misery lit books are made not in conventional bookstores but in mass-market outlets such as Asda and Tesco. Criticism Some of the genre's authors have said they write in order to come to terms with their traumatic memories, and to help readers do the same. Supporters of the genre also claim the genre's popularity indicates a growing cultural willingness to directly confront topics—specifically child sexual abuse—that once would have been ignored or swept under the rug. However, a common criticism of the genre is the suggestion that its appeal lies in prurience and voyeurism. The Times writer Carol Sarler suggests the popularity of the genre indicates a culture \\"utterly in thrall to paedophilia\\". Other critics locate the genre's popular appeal in its combination of moral outrage and titillation. Literary hoaxes \\"Misery lit\\" has been proven to be a popular genre for literary hoaxes in which authors claim to reveal painful stories from their past. One early such hoax was the 1836 book Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, or, The Hidden Secrets of a Nun's Life in a Convent Exposed, by Maria Monk, which claimed to tell of Monk's abuse in a convent. The book was a fabrication, and, though it contained a variety of factual errors, it became a widely read bestseller for several decades as it capitalized on anti-Catholic sentiment in the United States. The Holocaust has been the subject of several notable literary hoaxes by authors who either falsely claim to have lived through it, or were in fact Holocaust survivors but falsified their experiences. Such hoaxes include The Painted Bird (1965) by Jerzy Kosinski, Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood (1995) by Binjamin Wilkomirski, Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years (1997) by Misha Defonseca and Angel at the Fence by Herman Rosenblat (which was planned to be published in 2009, but publication was cancelled). Other, more recent memoirs, which tell of childhood miseries as a result of parental abuse, drug use, illness and the like, have been exposed as hoaxes, including Go Ask Alice (1971) by Beatrice Sparks, A Rock and a Hard Place: One Boy's Triumphant Story (1993) by \\"Anthony Godby Johnson\\", The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (2001) by \\"JT LeRoy\\", Kathy's Story (2005) by Kathy O'Beirne and Love and Consequences (2008) by Margaret Seltzer Some memoirs of suffering have included elements of both truth and fiction. These include I, Rigoberta Menchú (1983) by Rigoberta Menchú (a book that won Menchú the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992), and A Million Little Pieces (2003) by James Frey. The latter was initially marketed as non-fiction, and attracted considerable controversy when it was revealed that significant portions of it were fabricated.

It is the most numerous dairy breed in China and is distributed throughout the country. History Black and white dairy cattle were imported to major cities in China in the 1870s from Canada, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA. After the Second World War large American Holstein-Friesians were imported, as was smaller Dutch Black Pied stock from the Netherlands. These at first gave rise to larger and smaller types within the Chinese breed, but these can no longer be distinguished. A herd-book was established in 1983. This records all pedigree cattle. Use In 1982 the average milk yield of 270,000 cows was estimated at per lactation of 305 days. The highest recorded individual yield in one lactation was in 305 days, and the lifetime record was in 10 lactations totalling 3,721 days.

It is named after the Estonian town of Kunda, about east of Tallinn along the Gulf of Finland, near where the first extensively studied settlement was discovered on Lammasmäe Hill and in the surrounding peat bog. The oldest known settlement of the Kunda culture in Estonia is Pulli. The Kunda culture was succeeded by the Narva culture, who used pottery and showed some traces of food production. Culture Tools of Kunda Culture Most Kunda settlements are located near the edge of the forests beside rivers, lakes, or marshes. Elk were extensively hunted, perhaps helped by trained domestic hunting-dogs. On the coast seal hunting is represented. Pike and other fish were taken from the rivers. There is a rich bone and antler industry, especially in relation to fishing gear. Tools were decorated with simple geometric designs, lacking the complexity of the contemporary Maglemosian Culture communities to the southwest. Origin of culture The Kunda culture appears to have undergone a transition from the Palaeolithic Swiderian culture located previously over much of the same range. One such transition settlement, Pasieniai 1C in Lithuania, features stone tools of both Late Swiderian and early Kunda. One shape manufactured in both cultures is the retouched tanged point. The final Swiderian is dated 7800–7600 BC by calibrated radiocarbon dating, which is in the Preboreal period, at the end of which time with no gap the early Kunda begins. Evidently the descendants of the Swiderians were the first to settle Estonia when it became habitable. Other post-Swiderian groups extended as far east as the Ural mountains. Genetics In a genetic study published in Current Biology in February 2017, it was determined that peoples of the Kunda culture and the succeeding Narva culture showed closer genetic affinity with Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHGs) than Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs). In a genetic study published in Nature Communications in January 2018, the remains of a male and female ascribed to the Kunda culture was analyzed. The male was found to be carrying haplogroup I and U5b2c1, while the female carried U4a2. They were found to have \\"a very close affinity\\" with WHGs, although with \\"a significant contribution\\" from Ancient North Eurasians (ANE). Their ANE ancestry was lower than that of Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers, indicating that ANE ancestry entered Scandinavia without traversing the Baltic. A genetic study published in Nature in February 2018 included an analysis of a large number of individuals buried at the Zvejnieki burial ground, most of whom were affiliated with the Kunda culture and the succeeding Narva culture. The mtDNA extracted belonged exclusively to haplotypes of U5, U4 and U2. With regards to Y-DNA, the vast majority of samples belonged to R1b1a1a haplotypes and I2a1 haplotypes. The results affirmed that the Kunda and Narva cultures were about 70% WHG and 30% EHG. The nearby contemporary Pit–Comb Ware culture was on the contrary found to be about 65% EHG.

Pervasive zero marking is very rare, but instances of zero marking in various forms occur in quite a number of languages. Vietnamese and Indonesian are two national languages listed in the World Atlas of Language Structures as having zero-marking. In many East and Southeast Asian languages, such as Thai and Chinese, the head verb and its dependents are not marked for any arguments or for the nouns' roles in the sentence. On the other hand, possession is marked in such languages by the use of clitic particles between possessor and possessed. Some languages, such as many dialects of Arabic, use a similar process, called juxtaposition, to indicate possessive relationships. In Arabic, two nouns next to each other could indicate a possessed-possessor construction: ' \\"Maryam's books\\" (literally \\"books Maryam\\"). In Classical and Modern Standard Arabic, however, the second noun is in the genitive case, as in '. Zero-marking, when it occurs, tends to show a strong relationship with word order. Languages in which zero-marking is widespread are almost all subject–verb–object, perhaps because verb-medial order allows two or more nouns to be recognized as such much more easily than subject–object–verb, object–subject–verb, verb–subject–object, or verb–object–subject order, for which two nouns might be adjacent and their role in a sentence possibly thus confused. It has been suggested that verb-final languages may be likely to develop verb-medial order if marking on nouns is lost.

Jackie Coogan and Ted Cassidy, who played Uncle Fester and Lurch respectively from the 1960s television series, returned in voice-over roles. The cast also included an 11-year-old Jodie Foster, who performed the voice of Pugsley Addams. The show's theme music was completely different and had no lyrics and no finger snapping, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live- action show. Plot The Addams Family consists of husband and wife Gomez and Morticia Addams, their children Wednesday and Pugsley, as well as Grandmama, Uncle Fester, Thing, Cousin Itt, and their butler Lurch. The Addamses are a close-knit extended family with decidedly macabre interests and supernatural abilities. No explanation for their powers is explicitly given in the series. This series depicts the Addamses on a cross-country road trip, exploring the United States in their Victorian-style Creepy Camper that resembles their mansion. Along the way, they stop off at various locations and venues. They inadvertently cause mayhem wherever they go due to their unusual interests and mannerisms, their willingness to trust those who probably shouldn't be trusted, and their getting swept up in criminal schemes or problems without their knowledge.

John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy provided the voices for their respective Addams Family characters while voice actors were used to voice Grandmama, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Cousin Itt. The episode details the Addams Family in a mystery with the Scooby-Doo gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams comics. The Addams Family get their own cartoon The first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from 1973–1975 on NBC. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a Victorian-style Recreational vehicle (RV) that resembles their house. This series followed the relationships of the original Addams comics in that Fester is Gomez's brother, and Grandmama is Morticia's mother. Many cast members from the original series and the Scooby-Doo episode reprise their roles in the series, with the exceptions of Astin and Jones whose characters were voiced by Lennie Weinrib and Janet Waldo.

Characteristics of the Baroque The Baroque is characterized by the following features: *Pessimism: The Renaissance had been not successful in its purpose of imposing the harmony and the perfection over the world, as the humanists tried, and neither had made man happier; war and social inequalities continued; misery and calamity were common throughout Europe. An intellectual pessimism became more and more marked, together with a carefree character (of which the period's comedies and rogue narrations - on which the picaresque novels are based) give testimony. Calderón, Madrid. *Disappointment: As Renaissance ideals failed and, in the case of Spain, political power continued to ebb, disappointment grew and was manifest in literature which in many cases recalled that of two centuries before, as in the Dance of Death or the Poems on the Death of my Father by Manrique. According to Quevedo, life is formed by \\"successions of deceased\\": the new born ones become them, from the diaper to the shroud. In conclusion, nothing temporal has importance, it is necessary only to obtain eternal salvation. *Preoccupation about the passage of time. *Loss of confidence in the ideals of the Renaissance. In view of the crisis of the Baroque, Spanish writers reacted in several ways: *Escapism: The avoidance of reality, through singing past feats and glories, or through presenting an ideal world in which problems are resolved and order prevails; this is the case of the theater of Lope de Vega and his followers. Others, meanwhile, took refuge in the world of art and mythology, as in the case of Luis de Góngora. *Satire: Another group of writers chose to make fun of the reality, like Quevedo, Góngora on some occasions, and in the picaresque novel. *Stoicism: Complaints on the vanity of the world, the fleetingness of beauty, life, and fame. The greatest exponent of this was Calderón de la Barca in the autos sacramentales. *Moralizing: Criticizing the defects and vices, and proposing models of conduct in line with the political and religious ideology of their time, typified by the narrative and doctrinal prose of Gracián and of Saavedra Fajardo. Prose Miguel de Cervantes Miguel de Cervantes The narrative of the 17th century opens with the figure of Miguel de Cervantes, who returned to Spain in 1580 after ten years absence. His first printed work was The Galatea (1585). It is a pastoral novel (see Spanish Renaissance literature) in six books of verse and prose, according to the model of the Diana of Montemayor; although it breaks with the tradition when introducing realistic elements, like the murder of a shepherd, or the agility of certain dialogues. In 1605 he published The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, with immediate success. In 1613 the Exemplary novels appeared. They are a collection of twelve short novels that look for an ideal, although this is not always clear. In 1615, Cervantes published the second part of Don Quixote. In 1617, a year after Cervantes died, The works of Persiles and Sigismunda appeared. It draws on the Byzantine and Greek novelists such as Heliodorus (3rd century CE) and his The Ethiopian Story of Theagenes and Chariclea. It relates, in four books, how Periandro and Auristela travel from northern territories of Norway or Finland to Rome to receive Christian marriage. As is typical of this subgenre, throughout the trip they experience a variety of trials, mishaps, and delays: captivity by Barbarians, the jealousy and machinations of rivals. The work takes advantage of resources of the Exemplary Novels - especially the italianizing ones - puzzles, confusions, disguises, etc. Francisco de Quevedo Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas Francisco de Quevedo wrote towards 1604 his first work of prose fiction : the picaresque novel titled The Life Story of the Sharper called Don Pablos, example of wanderers and mirror of scrooges. Quevedo also wrote satirical, political and moral prose works where a stoic morality predominates, where subjects like the criticism of archetypes of the society of the Baroque, the constant presence of death in the life of man, and Christian fervor whereupon the politics has to conduct itself. The first of his Dreams dates from 1605: The Dream of the Judgment narrates the resurrection of the dead, who must answer for the manner of their life. It is a social satire against professions or trades: jurists, doctors, butchers... In 1619 he wrote the Politics of God, government of Christ and tyranny of Satan, a political treatise which expounds a doctrine of good government, or 'mirror of princes', for a righteous king, who should have Jesus Christ for model of conduct. It is a treatise in conformity with Spanish anti- Machiavellism, proposing a politics free of intrigue and unconnected with bad influences. Towards 1636 Quevedo concluded his last great satirical prose: The hour of everybody and the Fortune with prudence, unpublished until 1650. In it, Jupiter requests Fortune to give for one hour what each individual truly deserves. This makes plain the falsity of appearances, and the hidden truth under the veils of the hypocrisy. Operating by antithesis Quevedo shows doctors who are in fact executioners, the rich as poor but thieving, and a whole gallery of social types, offices and states is presented, all implacably satirized. Marcus Brutus (1644) arises from glosses or commentaries to the biography that Plutarch wrote on this Latin statesman in his Parallel lives. Baltasar Gracián Baltasar Gracián The most important work of the second half of the century is The Critical one (1651–1657) of the Aragonese Jesuit Baltasar Gracián (1601–1658). With it, the Spanish novel is solved in concepts or abstractions. The idea prevails over the concrete figure. It is a philosophical novel written in form of allegory of the human life. Gracián cultivated didactic prose in treatises of moral intention and practical purpose, like The Hero (1637), The Politician don Fernando the Catholic (1640) or The Discreet one (1646). In them he creates a full series that exemplifies the exemplary, prudent and sagacious man, and the qualities and virtues that must adorn him. The Manual oracle and art of prudence is a set of three hundred aphorisms composed to help the reader prevail in the complex world-in- crisis of the 17th century. (An English version of this dense treatise has been sold as a manual of self-help for executives and has obtained a recent publishing success.) He also wrote a rhetoric of Baroque literature, that starts from the texts to redefine the figures of speech of the time, because they did not relate to the classical models. It is a treaty on the concept, which he defines as \\"an act of the understanding which expresses the correspondence that is found between the objects\\". That is to say, a concept is every association between ideas or objects. To their classification and dissection Gracián dedicated his Art of talent, treatise on the witticism (1642), extended and reviewed in the later Witticism and art of talent (1648). The style of Gracián is dense and polysemous. It is constructed of brief sentences, abundant plays on words, and the ingenious association of concepts. Gracián's attitude to life is one of disillusionment, based on the decay of Spanish society. The world is seen as a hostile space full of deceit and illusion triumphing over virtue and truth, where Man is a self-interested and malicious being. Many of his books are manuals of behavior that allow the reader to succeed gracefully in spite of the maliciousness of his fellow men. For this, he must be prudent and wise, have knowledge of life and the motivations of others, until the point to behave \\"to the occasion\\" and \\"to play of the\\" dissimulation. Gracián is recognized as precursor of existentialism, he also influenced French moralists like La Rochefoucauld, and, in the 19th century, the philosophy of Schopenhauer. Other writers of prose Mateo Alemán by Pedro Perete *Lope de Vega stands out, whose well- known Novels to Marcia Leonarda can be singled out. They are a collection of miscellaneous novels, brief works, of amorous thematic and intricate technique, in which verse and prose are mixed. Charged with erudition, and subject to frequent and tedious digressions, they are set in exotic atmospheres and peopled with colorful characters. But Lope de Vega is primarily known as one of the greatest of Spanish playwrights, and his plays are written in verse. *Mateo Alemán y de Enero (Seville, 1547 - Mexico, 1615) was the author of the picaresque novel Life of the rascal Guzmán de Alfarache, published in 1599. This work established the canon of the genre. It achieved a formidable success in Spain and Europe, and was well known as \\"the rascal of Alemán\\". In 1604 the second part of the Guzmán de Alfarache was published in Lisbon. The European success of this work was formidable: it was translated almost immediately into Italian in the Venetian presses of Barezzi in 1606; published in German in Munich in 1615; J. Chapelain translated the two parts of the novel to the French and published them in Paris in 1620; two years later the English version was printed in London by James Mabbe who, in an extraordinary prologue, says of the rascal Guzmán that he was \\"similar to a ship, that sails on the brink of the shore, and never finishes taking port\\". *Alonso de Castillo Solórzano (1584–1648), native of Tordesillas (Valladolid), was a very popular novelist, author of The girl of the lies Teresa de Manzanares (1632), Adventures of the Trapaza Bachelor (1637) and The marten of Seville and hook of the bags (1642). They are picaresque works in which novels, poems and some entremés are mixed, as we have already seen in Lope de Vega. *Not without reason the Madrilenian María de Zayas y Sotomayor (1590–1661) is considered an important novelist of the century. In 1637 her Loving and exemplary novels appear, a collection of ten stories in which the erotic thematic creates conflicting and surprising situations. *Luis Vélez de Guevara (1579–1644), Sevillian, a follower of Francisco de Quevedo and author of \\"The devil cojuelo\\" (1641), a social satire accompanied by allegorical figures. *Antonio de Solís y Ribadeneyra (1610–1686), born in Alcala de Henares, was a dramatist and student of law at the University of Salamanca. His plays brought him fame which led to his post as secretary to the Count of Oropesa and later service at the royal courts of Philip IV and Charles II. Eventually appointed official chronicler of the Indies, his work Historia de la Conquista de Mexico (1684) is considered one of the last great works of Golden Age prose and it remained a standard European source on the Americas up through the Enlightenment. *Juan Ruiz de Alarcón (1581 - 4 August 1639) was a New Spain-born Spanish writer of the Golden Age who cultivated different variants of dramaturgy. Noted for his literary feuds with both Gongora and Lope de Vega. This half of the century closes with the Life and facts of Estebanillo González, man of good humor (Antwerp, 1646). It narrates his life (1608–1646) as servant of many masters, and soldier in several causes. It displays many characteristic themes of the picaresque genre: swindles, fights, deceits, drunkenness, robberies and prostitution. Religious prose shines with Miguel de Molinos (1628–1696), originally from Teruel but settled in Rome. His quietist doctrine can be read in Spiritual guide (1675), a manual of contemplative mysticism which despises action. Poetry Luis de Góngora and Francisco de Quevedo were the two most important poets. They were enemies and composed many bitter (and funny) satirical pieces attacking each other. Luis de Góngora Luis de Góngora by Diego Velázquez. Góngora's lyric collection consists of numerous sonnets, odes, ballads, songs for guitar, and of certain larger poems, such as the Soledades and the Polifemo, the two landmarks of culteranismo. Góngora alternates popular poetry with a more cultured one. That way he tries to emulate the style of Ancient Romans and Greeks poets using moreover their mythology. The usage of words that come directly from Latin and its complex syntax make him a difficult author to understand. Cultura Andaluza, Francisco Alejo Fernández, Juan Diego Caballero Oliver, José Luis González Rapela,Esteban Moreno Hernández, Jose Luis Moreno Navarro/ Página 258 Francisco de Quevedo Quevedo's poetry first appeared in an anthology by Pedro de Espinosa, Flowers of Illustrious Poets (1605). Quevedo was a master of conceptismo, a movement in opposition to culteranismo. The theater Theatrical performances of this time took place in open sites, squares or fixed corrals: the corrals of comedies. They began around two in the afternoon and lasted until dusk. In general they did not have seats, and spectators remained standing throughout the performance. The nobility occupied balconies and windows of houses that surrounded the square or led to the corral, and ladies attended the spectacle with their faces covered with masks or obscured behind lattice windows. The function began with a performance on guitar of a popular piece; immediately, songs accompanied with diverse instruments were sung. The praise came soon, species of explanation of the merits of the work and synthesis of its argument. The main comedy or work then started, and in the intervals dances were executed or entremeses represented. The stage was a simple platform and the decoration a curtain. The changes of scene were announced by one of the actors. The poet wrote the comedy, paid by the director, to whom he yielded all the rights on the work, represented or printed, to modify the text. The works lasted three or four days in the billboard, or (with exceptions) fifteen days for a successful comedy. Juan de la Cueva, in the second half of the 16th century, introduced two elements of great importance for the boom of this artistic production: popular ethics, that gave origin to the comedies of national historical character, and the freedom to compose plays considering popular taste. Lope de Vega and Tirso de Molina took these characteristics to their furthest extent. Lope de Vega Félix Lope de Vega Carpio At the end of the 16th century Lope de Vega created the new comedy: to a theme of romantic character is added another theme, historical or legendary, of moriscos, of captives, or religious. It concludes with a happy ending. Constructed on three days, the redondilla or the décima is used in the dialogues, the romance in the narrations, the sonnet in the monologues and the tercet in serious situations. The new art to make comedies, written in 1609, is a humorous defense of his theater. He shows scorn about the rigid interpretation that the theorists of the Renaissance—mostly Italian—had done of the Aristotelian ideas on the theatre, and he proposes as values, naturalness as opposed to artifice, variety as opposed to unity, and considering popular taste. Among his prolific dramatic production, some works can be singled out: Peribáñez and the Commander of Ocaña (1604–12) is a tragicomedy set in 1406 in Toledo: Peribáñez understands that the Commander of Ocaña has overwhelmed him with honors to harass his woman. After killing him he wins the royal pardon. Around 1614 Lope composed one of his better tragicomedies: Fuenteovejuna. Following the Chronicle of the three orders (Toledo, 1572) of , it shows the abuses by the Commander Fernán Gómez de Guzmán of the neighbors of Fuenteovejuna and of Laurencia, newly married with Frondoso. The murder of the Commander by the town and pardon by the Catholic Monarchs in the light of the evidence finishes off the action. A popular revolt triggered by abuse of power is presented, but only concerning a particular injustice, and submission to the king is emphasized. The Knight of Olmedo (about 1620-25), tragedy rooted in the Celestina, is based on a popular cantar: Don Alonso dies at the hands of Don Rodrigo, jealous at losing Doña Ines. The Best Mayor, The King is about the dignity of the farmer: Don Tello, haughty nobleman, abuses Elvira, engaged to the farmer Sancho. Alfonso VII allows her to recover her reputation, making her marry Don Tello, and then executes Don Tello, to make the—now noble—widow marry Sancho. Calderón de la Barca Pedro Calderón de la Barca The other great dramatist of the 17th century was Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600–1681). His most famous work is Life is a dream (1635), a philosophical drama in which Segismundo, son of the king of Poland, is chained in a tower because of the fateful predictions of the royal astrologers that he will kill his father. Meanwhile, Rosaura proclaims in the Court that her honor has been violated by Duke Astolfo. Duke Astolfo courts Estrella in order to become king. The aggressiveness of Segismundo explodes when he is released from his tower, where he returns, chained, believing he has dreamed his experience of freedom. When a riot rescues him again, his will overcomes the predictions: he overcomes his violent nature, marries Rosaura to Astolfo, and accepts the hand of Estrella. El alcalde de Zalamea may have been first staged in 1636 or 37. It was printed in 1651. First translated into English as The Garrotte Better Given, from 1683 on the title was more accurately rendered as The Mayor of Zalamea. It presents the story of the rape of Isabel, daughter of Pedro Crespo, by the captain Alvaro de Ataide. Pedro Crespo being named mayor, he kills de Ataide. The king listens to his defense and Crespo presents his reasons. He is then pardoned by the King. This customary drama of honor deals with Lope's similar theme of the honor of a peasant.

Shacklock may have been the inspiration for the naming of Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes. Shacklock was born at Crich, Derbyshire, and by 1881 was a professional cricketer living in Kirkby in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.British Census 1881 RG11 3323/31 p55 He made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire in September 1883 against MCC when he took a wicket in the first innings and four in the second innings but failed to score a run. Shacklock joined Derbyshire in the 1884 season and played regularly. In the 1885 season against Yorkshire in August he took 8 for 45 in the first innings, and 5 for 87 in the second innings of the same match. He shared the top wicket tally for the season with William Cropper. Shacklock took 59 wickets for Derbyshire at an average of 16.74 and a best performance of 8 for 45. In 1886 Shacklock rejoined Nottinghamshire and played 117 matches for them over the next eight years. For Nottinghamshire he took 360 wickets at an average of 18.74 and a best performance of 8 for 32. After 1889 Shacklock played for the MCC against the universities and also for sides selected by Nottinghamshire wicketkeeper Mordecai Sherwin. In 1903 Shacklock moved to New Zealand where he coached in DunedinOtago Daily Times, 29 October 1903, p. 4. and played for Otago. He remained in New Zealand and moved to Christchurch, where he was the principal coach to the Canterbury Cricket Association in the early 1920s. He died in Christchurch in 1937.Frank Shacklock at Cricket Archive The name of Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, is said to have been inspired by the combination of Shacklock and Sherwin.Times Review of Lawrence Booth, Arm-Ball to Zooter – a Sideways look at the Language of Cricket, Penguin, 2006 His fellow fast bowler at Derbyshire was William Mycroft and the pair Shacklock and Mycroft were prominent in a match against MCC at Lord's in June 1885. Conan Doyle, who was an active MCC member, published his first Sherlock Holmes story two years later. Holmes' brother in the stories was named Mycroft.

He observed how many figures, such as Pherozeshah Mehta, who would have made capable leaders, eschewed total alliance with the Congress for fear of damage to their private careers. Despite this lack of support from Indian leaders, Wacha did acknowledge the vital role that the Scotsman, Allan Hume, played in maintaining Congress in between sessions, stating, \\"He is the man to give us steam.\\" Still, Wacha expressed concern over Hume's growing influence over Congress and micromanagement of its affairs. \\"Because he is indispensable... [Hume] ought not to behave as a tyrant...He thinks in all matters he must have the upper hand.\\" Wacha encouraged fellow Indians to take a more active and vocal role in Congress affairs, expressing, \\"We [Indians] ought to be energetic and patriotic enough to make an advance in our political progress without such aid.

An allrounder, he was the first to complete the double twice in the Central Lancashire League. He once scored 38 runs off an eight- ball over.Cricinfo profile, Cricinfo. Life and career Cec Pepper played first-class cricket for New South Wales from 1938–39 to 1940–41. He fought in World War II in the Middle East and New Guinea, and at the end of the war he played for Australian Services cricket teams in England (the \\"Victory Tests\\" series) in 1945 and in India, Ceylon and Australia in 1945–46. Career highlights included an innings he played for New South Wales at Brisbane in 1940–41 when he made 81 with all but 7 of them coming in boundaries. His only century came when he hit 168 in 146 minutes, with 17 fours and 6 sixes, for the Australian Services XI against H.D.G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Scarborough in 1945.HDG Leveson-Gower's XI v Australian Services XI 1945 His best bowling figures of 6 for 33 came in 1949–50 when touring India with a Commonwealth side. He took a hat-trick in the match.Holkar v Commonwealth XI 1949–50 He played only two first-class matches after that tour, spending the rest of his career as a professional in league cricket. Pepper became embroiled in a row that is widely believed to have cost him Test selection. Teammates Keith Miller and Dick Whitington regarded him as one of the best all rounders in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection. Pepper appealed for leg before wicket against Australian captain Don Bradman in a match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire, prompting Bradman, who was also a member of the Australian Board, to lodge a complaint about Pepper. Pepper was subsequently never selected for Australia.Pollard (1988), p. 372. Cricket historian Gideon Haigh said that \\"[team manager Keith] Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [national] selection panel [Bradman among them] ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand\\" in 1945–46.Haigh and Frith, pp. 98-99. Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no directive had been given to the selectors to exclude Pepper. Garry Sobers, who played against him in league cricket, said of Pepper that \\"the reason why he never played county cricket was probably because of his overripe language. He was certainly good enough as a cricketer but no one wanted to take the chance ... It is said that Sir Don Bradman once remarked that had Cec's mouth and his attitude been different, he would have been one of the greatest all-rounders the world has ever seen.\\"Garry Sobers, My Autobiography, Headline, London, 2002, p. 50. After retiring he became an umpire in county cricket from 1964 until 1980. He remained in England and died in 1993 in Lancashire. His Wisden obituary noted that \\"A Manchester Evening News correspondent said he could not imagine any match involving Pepper pursuing a peaceful course\\", but added that usually \\"there was more humour than anger\\".Wisden 1994, p. 1350.

Its name means \\"a farmstead where broom grows\\" broom is a small yellow flowering shrub. Today, Brompton is a small residential village between Chatham Dockyard and Gillingham. Overview Brompton dates back to the late 17th century, and grew rapidly in the 18th century to accommodate the fast-growing dockyard workforce. It was a deliberately planned settlement, laid out by Thomas Rogers, Esquire, the owner of Westcourt Manor on whose demesne lands it was built. In the 1750s, with the building of the Chatham Lines to defend Chatham Dockyard, the village became completely surrounded by military establishments, limiting its ability to expand much beyond its original plan. When war with France recommenced in 1778, it was necessary to strengthen the dockyard defences. Fort Amherst and the Chatham Lines (defensive ditches) were improved and extended, and work was later begun on additional perimeter forts in Chatham and Rochester. The Barracks – still in existence today – were built to house the soldiers. This, and the expansion of the dockyard, meant that more homes were needed for the workers. The position of the Chatham Lines meant that eventually building could only happen to the east of the defensive ditch, and so New Brompton came into being. The population rose to 9,000 by 1851. From the 1850s, following the building of New Brompton & Gillingham Station, and the subsequent expansion of the town of New Brompton (Gillingham), the original settlement of Brompton became known as Old Brompton. From the late 19th century the importance of Old Brompton as a commercial center began to decline, finally being destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s when redevelopment by Gillingham Council tore down the main 18th & 19th century shopping streets (High Street, Wood Street, Middle Street), replacing shops with council housing, leaving just a handful of shops at the southern end of the High Street. The closure of Chatham Dockyard in 1984 spelled the end for several of the shops and pubs that did manage to survive the Council redevelopments. Gillingham Green was a small village; eventually it, too, was swallowed up, and the name of the whole settlement changed to Gillingham. Officers' houses were built within the confines of the Barracks and at Brompton where Mansion Row, Prospect Row and Garden Street now form part of the Brompton-Lines conservation area. New Brompton was the name originally given to Gillingham station on the Chatham Main Line. New Brompton was the original name of Gillingham F.C. Founded in 1893 it changed its name in 1913. Brompton Barracks has been home to the Royal Engineers since 1812, and now houses the Royal Engineers Museum. The Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME) is based at Brompton Barracks Brompton is also part of the Chatham Dockyard World Heritage bid.

He spent seven years in Major League Soccer (MLS) with the New England Revolution and Colorado Rapids. He was also a member of the American squads at the 1989 U-16 World Championships, 1993 U-20 World Cup and the 1996 Summer Olympics. Baba earned one cap with the senior United States national team. Youth and college Baba's father moved to Texas from Palestine. Baba was born and raised in Texas. In 1990, he was given a trial at Manchester United, but failed to impress. He was the 1992 Texas High School Player of the Year and a four-time Parade Magazine high school All-American, the only player to earn that honor four times. After high school, he attended the Clemson University where he played on the men's soccer team for three seasons from 1993 to 1995. A varsity starter as a freshman, Baba elected to skip his last season in order to turn professional. Major League Soccer On March 4, 1996, the New England Revolution selected Baba in the second round (16th overall) of the 1996 MLS College Draft. Baba spent five seasons with the Revs. He became a free agent on December 21, 2000. The Revs traded him to the Colorado Rapids for Matt Okoh, the rights to Alan Woods and a second round draft pick on March 19, 2001. Baba spent the next two seasons with the Rapids before announcing his retirement on June 13, 2002. National team Baba entered the national team program with the U-16 team as it went through qualifications for the 1989 U-16 World Championship. The U.S. easily qualified only to go 1-1-1 in group play and fail to make the second round. However, Baba scored the lone U.S. goal in its victory over Brazil, the first U.S. goal of the tournament. Baba went on to play for the U.S. at the 1993 U-20 World Cup in Australia. Baba scored a goal in the 6-0 victory over Turkey in the first U.S. game of the tournament. Once again this was the first U.S. goal of the tournament. The U.S. again went 1-1-1 in group play, but this time it advanced to the second round where the team met Brazil. This time the results were not so favorable to the U.S. as it fell 3-0 to Brazil. In 1995, Baba again played with the U.S., this time as part of the U-23 national team at the Pan American Games. In this tournament, he started two of the three U.S. games as the U.S. crashed out with an 0-3 record. He was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

It was a two-seat multi-role aircraft, primarily used as a ground attack machine. Like the other Hannover \\"light-C-class\\", or \\"CL\\" designated aircraft designed by Hermann Dorner, it included an unusual biplane tail, allowing for a greater firing arc for the tail gunner. Until the introduction of the aircraft, such tails had only been used on larger aircraft.

It was also intended that it should use the excellent Mercedes D.III engine, but the Idflieg gave priority for these engines to fighter production, and most CL.IIIs were produced with the same Argus engine that the CL.II had used.

Life and career   Early life and education  Omar Naim was born in Jordan to a Lebanese journalist father and the renowned Lebanese actress and playwright mother Nidal Al-Ashkar. Growing up surrounded by artists, musicians and writers, Naim had a childhood enriched with art and culture. His parents were both in theater and film. His mother, Nidal Al-Ashkar, the matriarch of Lebanese theater, is the founder of Masrah Al-Madina (The City Theater) where she was decorated by the French government in 1997 with a Knight Grade Decoration of Arts and Letters. Naim had his first film-going experience at 14. As he grew more and more fascinated with the world of cinema, he became furthermore interested in nurturing the abilities of writing and visuals. As an aspiring filmmaker, Naim was mostly inspired by directors like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone and Spike Lee. With the help of the Fares Foundation, Naim went on to study film at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. During his four-year education at Emerson, Naim created a number of short films, among which figures his 1999 thesis, a 28-minute documentary titled Grand Theater: A Tale of Beirut. In this work, Naim puts the spotlight on Beirut’s historic Grand Theater, which was torn in a violent no-man's land between two bellicose sides in the Lebanese civil war. The theater serves as a metaphorical illustration for Lebanon's tragic 15-year civil war. Through the eyes of the old theater, the different tales of actors, directors, soldiers and civilians are woven together at the Grand Theater. As war escalates in scale and absurdity, the lines between war and theater, as well as between show and reality, become blurred. The film earned Naim several awards at Emerson, an Honorable Mention, and played at a number of international festivals. Naim was also a finalist for the Student Oscar given by the AMPAS in 2000. Above all, and perhaps most importantly, this film earned the young director loaded hands-on experience he needed to be able to tackle his next giant project, which was still dormant at that time. “I learned everything making that film, from inception to print”, says Naim.  Career  In 2004, Naim wrote and directed his first feature film, The Final Cut, which starred Academy Award winning actor and comedian Robin Williams, Academy Award winning actress Mira Sorvino, and Jim Caviezel. Tak Fujimoto, of The Silence of the Lambs and The Sixth Sense fame, oversaw the cinematography. The film won the best screenplay award at the Deauville Film Festival and was an official selection of the Berlin Film Festival. “The Final Cut is about editing and memory” said the young director barely 27 at the time. Naim also stated that his Lebanese origins also influenced the film's plot. “It’s the Lebanese notion of mass memory, and people's very subjective memory and view of the world,” he explains. “This subsequently dictates how society functions. I extrapolated that into sci-fi theory”. Naim had sent his script to the French project Equinox, where hundreds of screenwriters from around the world submit their movie scripts. Only ten are chosen and are flown into Bordeaux to work on their screenplay with a group of experts for a week. Naim was one of the lucky ten and was then fixed with an agent. Upon his arrival, Naim made it clear that he was not interested in having anyone but himself direct his movie. Naim indeed was allotted the post of director and, once headed to the U.S., Lionsgate Entertainment gave the script a green light. As Lionsgate was recruiting actors, Robin Williams expressed interest in playing the lead role of Alan Hakman. Having loved the script, Williams told Naim that what really “struck” him was the “sense of mortality, something [he] hadn't explored as an actor before”. Within weeks, the rest of the cast and crew was hired. The 95 minutes movie was shot on 35mm film in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and was described by Naim as a very harmonious, very organized 35-day shoot “with no problems whatsoever”.

After Fitzgerald's death in 1940, Edmund Wilson compiled and edited this anthology, first published by New Directions in 1945.

S. Eliot, and Edith Wharton, praising Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. Famous quotes At the beginning of The Crack-Up Fitzgerald makes this widely quoted general observation:— As an example of this \\"truth,\\" he cites the ability to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. In modern decision theory, the quote has been used by some to explain the bias shown in many experiments, where subjects gather information to justify a preconceived notion. These experiments suggest that the mental ability described by Fitzgerald (being able to see both sides of an argument) is rarer than many assume. Reaction The essays when originally written were poorly received and many reviewers were openly critical, particularly of the personal revelations. Time has been somewhat kinder to them and the collection is an insight into the mind of the writer during this low period in his life. The philosopher Gilles Deleuze adopted the term crack-up from Fitzgerald to refer to his interpretation of the Freudian death instinctKorine,\\"A Crack-Up at the Race Riots\\". In popular culture The title of the 2017 Fleet Foxes album Crack-Up was inspired by these essays.Fleet Foxes - Robin Pecknold Interview with Zach Cowie References  * External links *The Crack-Up By F.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Fremantle) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Fremantle was laid down by Evans Deakin & Co at Brisbane, Queensland. She was launched on 18 March 1942 by the wife of Prime Minister John Curtin, and commissioned into the RAN on 24 March 1943. Operational history World War II When Fremantle entered active service in April 1943, she was immediately assigned to convoy escort duties along the east coast of Australia. This continued until August 1943, when the corvette was assigned as a convoy escort between Darwin and Thursday Island. She continued this duty until June 1945, when she was ordered to New Guinea waters to act as a guard ship. Fremantle remained in New Guinea waters until the end of World War II. The ship received two battle honours for her wartime service; \\"Darwin 1943\\" and \\"Pacific 1943–45\\". Following the war's end, Fremantle was sent to Hong Kong, where she joined the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla in August 1945 and was involved in mine clearance in Chinese waters. On completion, the corvette returned to Australia, visiting her namesake city for the first time on 18 November 1945, before arriving in Melbourne and paying off into reserve on 25 January 1946. Post-war Fremantle was recommissioned on 10 December 1952 as a training ship for National Service trainees. Based in the port of Fremantle, the corvette was also involved in fisheries protection, monitoring of the Japanese pearling fleet, and hydrographic surveys. Decommissioning and fate Fremantle paid off to reserve for the second time on 22 June 1959. She was sold for scrapping to Kinoshita (Australia) Pty Ltd on 6 January 1961.

History It was built by Sir William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, in 1345 to a rectangular plan, with octagonal towers at each angle, a gatehouse on the east, and a residential range on the west, the whole surrounded by a broad moat. Additions were made by Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham who acquired it in 1437 by exchanging it for other manors in Northamptonshire. The castle is unusual in that it has survived largely intact. Amongst the antiquities there is a 15th-century chair upon which Henry VII was crowned after the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, a table owned by Sir Everard Digby (cousin to the Digbys of Coleshill) around which the Gunpowder Plot was planned in 1605, and a 'Whispering Door' (two doors with a common jamb) brought from Kenilworth Castle. The castle gardens The present family, the Fetherston-Dilkes, first came into possession in the 17th century. During the Civil War Maxstoke was garrisoned for Parliament. The first known Governor of Maxstoke Castle in 1642/43 was a Captain Layfield. The garrison musters reveal that between March 1644 to October 1645, the Captain of the garrison was Mr Henry Kendall Sen. lord of the manor of Austrey. His son Henry Kendall Jun. was his lieutenant. The garrison included several of their Austrey tenants: William Smart (a joiner's son), Henry Orton, Henry Spencer and John Crispe.P.R.O. Exchequer SP28/121A-122. In the 18th century William Dilke of Maxstoke married Mary Fetherstone-Leigh of Packwood House near Knowle. Since then the two families and houses have been closely linked. Current Maxstoke Castle is opened to the public annually (usually in mid-June), in aid of local charities. Also, you can book tours for interested historical groups any time. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building. The parkland of Maxstoke has been a golf course since 1898. At one time, the land was listed as a deer park and deer can still be seen there.

These signals are rebroadcast on the received frequency, typically, with power higher than the original signal, to confuse enemy navigation. Consequently, aircraft or ground stations are given inaccurate bearings. Meaconing is more of a concern to personnel in navigation ratings than to radio operators. However, communications transmitters are often used to transmit navigation signals. Since communications personnel operate the transmitters, they must know how to deal with any communications problems resulting from meaconing. Successful meaconing can cause aircraft to be lured into \\"hot\\" (ambush-ready) landing zones or enemy airspace, ships to be diverted from their intended routes, bombers to expend ordnance on false targets, or ground stations to receive inaccurate bearings or position locations. The term 'meacon' is a portmanteau of masking beacon. Alleged cases of meaconing Iran says it used this technique (among others) to capture a USAF RQ-170 Sentinel drone, causing it to crash land. Meaconing in this case could provide a drone with false altitude measurements, causing a crash landing. Meaconing is among fringe theories for some aircraft crashes, such as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash.\\"To był zamach\\"- mówią eksperci Gazecie Polskiej (20 May 2010) (In Polish) Acronym * MIJI (Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference) In popular culture In the film Tomorrow Never Dies, a military GPS signal is meaconed to send a Royal Navy frigate off course.

It was during this time that Scott Sorry departed and was replaced by guitar/bass tech Jeremy Guns and Dazzle Rebel of Red Star Rebels for the shows. Despite assurances, it looked likely that the Brides were to split up, with Tracii joining Quiet Riot, a move that was to be short lived after he parted ways less than a month later. Tracii announced he was to perform a 'Best Of\\" tour with former L.A. Guns members Paul Black on vocals, Nickey Alexander on drums and former Brides live member Jeremy Guns rounding up the lineup on bass. With The Tracii Guns Band touring, the Brides were put on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Critical reception Reviews for the album were fairly positive with Allmusic again given giving a Brides album a 3.5/5 rating stating \\"What you get is an album that follows the direction of the debut – raw, in your face, guitar-riff rock, with lyrics that usually focus on the darker side of life, as evidenced by the Motörhead-esque \\"Dead Man's Ruin\\" and the Guns N' Roses-esque \\"White Trash.\\".[ allmusic ((( Runaway Brides > Overview)))] Metal-Temple gave the album 3 out of 5 stars saying \\"There is more than one style the bands trying to present.

The owners of the three railroads had been working closely together since an October 8, 1852 meeting in Cleveland to plan an expansion of the \\"Great Broad Route\\", the Erie Railroad, through their respective areas. On March 12, 1862, general control of all three companies was placed under a central board made of two directors from each of the companies. The Ohio Board was represented by Marvin Kent and Worthy S. Streator; the Pennsylvania Board by William Reynolds and John Dick; and the New York Board by A. F. Allen and Thomas W. Kennard. William Reynolds was elected President of the Board. The line reached Cleveland on November 18, 1863 and was connected to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad in Dayton on June 20, 1864; thus linking St. Louis with New York via a gauge line. On August 19, 1865 an agreement was drafted to merge the three separate companies, each named Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, into the Atlantic and Great Western Railway. On October 5 of that year the new company issued a $30 million mortgage to pay off the outstanding mortgages on various companies included in the merger. The company went into the hands of a receiver, Robert B. Potter of New York, on April 1, 1867. Potter operated the railroad until December 1868 when it was leased for 12 years by the Erie Railroad. Jay Gould, then president of the Erie, arranged to have the company again placed into receivership, this time with Gould and W. A. O'Doherty as receivers. This receivership was transferred to Reuben Hitchcock of Cleveland in November 1869. In February 1870, the Erie again leased the company, pending foreclosure. The foreclosure took place and the property was purchased on July 26, 1871 by Gen. George B. McClellan, William Butler Duncan and Allen G. Thurman. A deed for the property was finalized on October 3, 1871. The new company was named the Atlantic and Great Western Railway, the same as the old, but on consolidation of the individual parts (one in each state) in November, the name was changed back to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. In May 1874, the Atlantic and Great Western was again leased by the Erie, at terms very generous to the A&GW; and its backer James McHenry. On December 10, 1874 the new president of the Erie, Hugh J. Jewett, repudiated the lease and the company went into the hands of a new receiver, J. H. Devereaux. This action led to a series of lawsuits between McHenry and Jewett which brought shame to both companies. On January 10, 1880 the property was again sold at foreclosure and was reorganized as the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad.

Like his predecessors, he initially allied with the Aragonese of Naples, in his case by marrying Marianna of Aragon in 1510, widow of Roberto II Sanseverino. After Marianna's death, he married to Emilia Ridolfi, niece of Pope Leo X; she died soon afterwards, and Jacopo remarried with her sister Clarice.

He is chiefly known for having written the draft of the libretto of the opera Don Pasquale for its composer Gaetano Donizetti. Don Pasquale Ruffini had been condemned to death as an enemy of the state and was living in exile in Paris in 1842 when it was suggested to him by Jules Janin (newly appointed director of Théâtre-Italien) that he might offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist . Donizetti told him exactly what he required for his latest opera project, Don Pasquale, but not that he intended to re-use music already written for other purposes. Ruffini duly wrote the draft libretto from the original text dating back to 1810, but Donizetti changed so much of Ruffini's version that librettist became angry and refused to allow his name to be mentioned in the programme for the première at the Théâtre Italien in Paris 3 January 1843. Although Ruffini refused acknowledgement of his work for the libretto, Donizetti paid him 500 francs, which was competitive for both the length and the genre at the time. Ruffini also reportedly enjoyed working with Donizetti in the early stages of their collaboration, though he wrote to family and friends that the composer continually pressed him to work faster.Weinstock 1963, pp. 188—190 Ruffini wrote several novels which were published in English by Thomas Constable & Company in Edinburgh, including Lorenzo Benoni Or Passages in the Life of an Italian (1853), The Paragreens on a Visit to the Paris Universal Exhibition (1856) and Doctor Antonio: A Tale (1858). These novels sought to raise the sympathy of people in England and France for the struggles of the Italian people during the Risorgimento.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies some 5 km west of the district seat, Wittlich, in the southern Eifel at an elevation of some 300 m above sea level, and affords a raised view into the Wittlicher Senke (depression). Bergweiler belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wittlich-Land, whose seat is in Wittlich, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. Formerly the municipality was called “Bergweiler über Wittlich” (“above Wittlich”), which expressed both the proximity to the district seat and the municipality's geographical location.  Land use  The municipal area measures 13.25 km² of which 5.71 km² is used for agriculture and 6.33 km² is wooded.  Neighbouring municipalities  Bergweiler's neighbours are Wittlich, Bruch, Dreis and Hupperath.  History  Near Bergweiler, traces of Stone Age settlement – stone tools – have been found that have been dated to around 3000 BC. There are also clues that point to Roman settlement near the village. In 981, Bergweiler had its first documentary mention as Wilre, an archaic form of the German word Weiler, meaning “hamlet”. Thereafter the name changed several times, mostly to fit the ever-changing language. Thus the village was in 1056 called Villaris, in 1171 Reinboldvillari, in 1184 Villare, in 1190 Vilare, in 1219 Wilare, in 1243 Remboldswilre, in the 14th century Wilre supra montem, in 1417 Wiler, in 1428 Wilre, in 1487 Wyler, in 1569 Bergwiler and then eventually Bergweiler in 1656. In an episcopal visitation protocol from 1669, this name is used for Bergweiler. From this same protocol comes the first mention of a small church, which is known today as the Fintenkapelle. As early as the 13th century, Bergweiler was being described as a parish seat. In 1669 and 1833, the church was newly built on the same spot in what was then the centre of Bergweiler (Unterdorf, or “Lower Village”). In 1957, Saint John's Catholic Church (Kirche St. Johannes) was renovated and partly converted, for the most part through the inhabitants’ own work. Neighbouring the church with its forecourt is a graveyard. Housed in the accompanying parish hall is the village's Eifel-Heimat-Museum, a local history museum. The Fintenkapelle, outside the village, from the 17th century, frequented as a local pilgrimage church, was in 1959 likewise renovated. The small field chapel is known as a pilgrimage chapel for sick children. Formerly, the sick child's weight in a crib in grain was used to determine the donation that had to be made to the chapel for its use. The many votive tablets inside the chapel still bear witness today to the chapel's function as a place of prayer. Architecturally interesting is the little pulpit outside the chapel. It was formerly necessary for the priest to preach to believers gathered outside in the open field before the chapel from this outdoor pulpit because the chapel was too small. The chapel was first mentioned in 1656; it was newly built in 1717. In 2004, the chapel was once again lavishly renovated by local volunteer helpers, and since then it has shone with new radiance. The Fintenkapelle is the municipality's landmark. Before the French Revolution, the Lords of Warsberg held the landlordship in the Imperial Knightly Lordship of Bergweiler. Years- long legal proceedings over Imperial immediacy before the Imperial Chamber Court were rendered obsolete in 1794 by the French occupation of the area. In 1815, Bergweiler became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The village is even today, both by the inhabitants and on maps, divided into two Ortsteile. The old centre with the church is called Bergweiler or Unterdorf (“Lower Village”), whereas the newer part, which is a few metres higher than the older part, is called Oberbergweiler or Oberdorf (“Upper Village”). Meanwhile, the further building that comes with population growth means that the village is growing together more and more.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The twelve seats on council are shared between the Thielen voters’ group (7 seats) and the Bergweiler free voters’ group (5 seats).Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Schild geteilt, oben in Schwarz ein goldbekrönter und goldbewehrter silberner wachsender Löwe, unten Silber-Rot geschacht. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess sable a demi-lion rampant argent armed and crowned Or and chequy argent and gules. To establish the historical basis for Bergweiler's coat of arms, one must go back to the territorial situation before 1789. Bergweiler's landlord was the Baron of Warsberg. He exercised his powers within the Imperially immediate Lordship of Bergweiler, which had been transferred to the Counts of Sponheim. Bergweiler's coat of arms must therefore express both the overlordship of the Counts of Sponheim and the landlordship of the Barons of Warsberg. This was done by composing a coat of arms party per fess (divided crosswise through the centre) whose lower half shows the Sponheims’ silver and red checkerboard pattern, and whose upper half shows a black field charged with the Warsbergs’ silver lion. By approval in 1967, Bergweiler was granted the right to bear its own arms.  Culture and sightseeing * At the Eifel- Heimat-Museum (Kirchstraße 3), agricultural equipment and tools from the 19th century are shown. In the middle of the museum stands an oil painting that shows one of the many legends surrounding the history of the Wittlich Säubrennerkirmes (a folk festival started in 1950 and based on a 14th-century legend). The painting, believed to be the biggest oil painting in Rhineland- Palatinate, was painted by Otto Frankfurter. * The Werthelstein (also called Wedelstein or Würstelstein, or dialectally, Werdelsteen) is a pillarlike, isolated crag measuring some two to three metres in cross-section with relatively smooth surfaces. It stands at the municipal limit, where it crosses the old way from Bergweiler to Dreis. According to legend it is a sacrifice stone. Since 1940 it has been a natural monument. * Fintenkapelle: a small pilgrimage chapel from the 17th century outside the village.

It is known above all for its wine and its meteorological distinctions.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies on the Mosel near Bernkastel-Kues. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the town of the same name.  Climate  Here on 11 August 1998, the highest ever temperature in Germany was measured, 41.2 °C, at the Meteomedia weather station by Jörg Kachelmann. Nevertheless, Brauneberg is not said to be Germany's number-one hotspot because the weather station is not included in official measurements owing to its location on a slate mountain.  Constituent communities  Brauneberg's Ortsteile are Brauneberg, Filzen and Hirzlei. Although the outlying centre of Hirzlei is indeed an integral part of Brauneberg, there is no direct road linking it to the main centre. The village representative – Ortsvorsteher – of Hirzlei is Ewald Adam.  History  Dusemont 1838 View of Brauneberg from the other side of the Moselle The name Brauneberg is first mentioned in documents dating 588. The old placename, Dusemond, may well have stemmed from what one of the vineyards here was called in Roman times: dulcis mons (Latin for “sweet mountain”). In 1925, the village's name was changed to Brauneberg. Dusemond belonged to the old County of Veldenz, into which Count Palatine Louis II introduced the Reformation in 1523. In the Thirty Years' War, the Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier seized ownership of the village. Only with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia was the Count of Veldenz reinstated with all his old rights, whereby the village's parish once more became Protestant. With the occupation of the County of Veldenz by France in 1680, however, the situation changed yet again and there arose a dispute over Catholics’ status within the County. By decree, the French settled the situation on 21 December 1684: Under its terms, in places with only one church – such as was the case in Dusemond – this would be given over to use by both denominations. The local church thus became a simultaneous church. Only in 1955 did this change, when it was decided to divide the church and separate it structurally. Since then, one third of the church has been used by the Evangelical congregation and the other two thirds by the Catholics. This matches the shares of the cost paid by each for the building of today's church, which was completed in 1777. Juffer vineyard The church itself was built between 1775 and 1777 to plans by Palatine court master builder Franz Wilhelm Rabaliatti. The onion-domed tower is the only such churchtower in the whole Moselle region. Although the church has been divided, it is still under both denominations’ joint ownership. Today's municipality of Brauneberg came into being on 7 June 1969 through the merger of the municipalities of Brauneberg and Filzen.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The sixteen seats on council are shared among the three voters’ groups Licht (6 seats), Denzer (6 seats) and Hepp (4 seats).Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Winegrowing  Besides tourism, winegrowing is the most important branch of industry. Vines are worked overwhelmingly in steep-slope vineyards in an area of 323 ha. Customarily, it is Riesling that is grown, although in some even and steep-slope vineyards smaller quantities of Müller-Thurgau, Kerner and Dornfelder are grown. Brauneberg's vineyards belong to the winemaking appellation – Großlage – of Kurfürstlay, and are further grouped into these locations: * Mandelgraben The vines at Mandelgraben cover an area of 175 ha. The name refers to the almond trees (Mandel means “almond” in German) that once grew here. * Klostergarten Klostergarten is with its 95 ha Brauneberg's second biggest vineyard. The name comes from the garden (Garten) at the Franciscan convent (Kloster) in the outlying centre of Filzen. * Juffer and Juffer Sonnenuhr The steep slope opposite Brauneberg is called Juffer (Moselle Franconian for standard German Jungfer or Jungfrau – maiden or virgin). Within this location, the area around the sundial (Sonnenuhr) is regarded as the choicest part of the vineyard and is given the name Juffer Sonnenuhr. * Kammer This small vineyard of only 0.38 ha likewise lies in the Juffer underneath a jutting crag.  Historical  In 1868, under the leadership of the Royal Cadastral Inspector, Steuerrath Clotten, a winegrowing map for the Regierungsbezirk of Trier was compiled for the Royal government at Trier. For the Brauneberg (Dusemond) area, under the Großlage of Brauneberg, the following individual locations were marked on it: *Hasenläufer *Kammer *Falkenberg *Juffer *Mötschert *Burgerslay  Famous people   Sons and daughters of the town  * Ulli Bögershausen, internationally known solo guitarist and guitar teacher * Katja Fehres, Moselle Wine Queen, Mosel-Saar-Ruwer 2006/2007 * Fabian Ostermann, conductor and international juror of CISM (Confédération Internationale des Sociétés musicales) * Johann Matthias Schreiber (1709–1771), German organ builder *Julius P.

Geography   Location  Dhronecken lies between Trier and Saarbrücken, on the Hunsrückhöhenstraße (“Hunsrück Heights Road”, a scenic road across the Hunsrück built originally as a military road on Hermann Göring’s orders), 9 km from the Autobahn A 1 towards Morbach. In the Dhronecker Mulde (hollow), the Kleine Dhron forms where two brooks meet. This river flows down a dale to the small river Dhron, which then empties into the Moselle. Dhronecken belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf, whose seat is in the municipality of Thalfang.  History   Early times  Dhronecken lies in what is known to be the oldest tribal heartland of the Celts, whose lands, about 500 BC, stretched from the Middle Danube to Lorraine (Hallstatt culture), and who spread only in later centuries into what is now France. Burying grounds and, even more so, hill fortifications bear witness to those times. The Hunnenring – not far away, near Otzenhausen – is a mighty example.  Roman times  With Caesar’s victory over the Celtic tribes in 51 BC, the place that is now Dhronecken became part of a Roman province called Belgica Prima. In that time, a Roman sanctum came to be near Dhronecken. Also worth noting is the widespread settlement of Sarmatians between the Dhron and the Nahe, as they were non-Germanic people from the Russian steppes.Cüppers, Die Römer in Rheinland-Pfalz, 1990 With the Germanic migration period, the Roman occupation came to an end after many Celtic uprisings and the first Germanic invasions.  Frankish times  Then began the Franks’ rule. Their kings divided the land into Gaue (“regions” or “districts”; singular: Gau), putting Dhronecken into the Triergau and thereby under the Bishop of Trier, as confirmed about the year 800 by documents issued by the kings Pepin and Charlemagne.  Middle Ages to present  In the course of the Middle Ages, there was a splintering into smaller territories, and Troneck – as it was then known – became part of the Mark Thalfang (Talevangero marca). At the onset of the modern age, Troneck was the seat of the Waldgraves and the main town of the Mark Thalfang. After the French Revolution, the Rhine’s left bank, and thereby Dhronecken too, were ceded to France in 1794 and 1795. Through a law from 26 March 1798, the French abolished feudal rights in their zone of occupation. After French rule ended, the village passed in 1814 to the Kingdom of Prussia. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Connection with the Nibelung saga  Dhronecken might be the hometown of the Nibelung hero Hagen von Tronje, as he is described in the foremost edition of the saga as “Hagen von Troneg” (with further examples in the dative case: von Tronege Hagene, geborn von Tronege, helt von Tronege, von Tronegaere). According to a multi-volume standard work of Germanic ancient history, : Research identifies Hagen’s origins, foremost, with the Castle Troneck in the Hunsrück, but also other places claim this, as certain (that is, solid) clues are missing. Now, in the year 752, a mediaeval document mentions for the first time the (river) Dhron as “Drona” (The Latin form “Drahonus” in Ausonius’s Mosella poem, late 4th century, is said to be unreliable), which together with the location at the forks, the corner (“corner” is Ecke in German) of two brooks, gave the mediaeval castle (Troneg/Troneck) its name. Possibly the writer of the Nibelungenlied, about the year 1200, believed that he had found the ancient-historical Hagen’s homeland in Troneck and places of the region (Hunoldispetra, Balderingin, Metz).Johannes Hoops u.a 2006.

Having been destroyed several times, by Cologne, Imperial and French troops, and then finally by an earthquake, only remnants are left now, although a corner tower can still be climbed. On the old castle's foundations in modern times, commercial buildings were built, and also a bigger, tall building – called the Schloss – which is today used as a forester's office. Also, a barn with beam construction serves as a community centre for the municipality of Dhronecken. The attractively laid-out castle gardens have been continuously planted and tended since 1985. Below the castle is found a nature play area on both sides of a brook. A ford with stepping stones, a forumlike playing and gathering place on a slope, made out of mighty stone blocks, wooden footbridges over wetlands left in their natural state, playing houses, a suspension bridge and a monorail are the great attractions not only for children, but also for adults. Haus des wild- und rheingräflichen Verwalters der Burg Dhronecken The “House of the Wild- and Rhine-Comital Administrator of Castle Dhronecken” was, as shown by dendrological analysis, built in the Baroque style. It belonged to Castle Dhronecken's comital administrator, Friedrich Christian Heusner, who was at the same time an Amtmann and judge. Since 1981 this house has been under monumental protection, thereby allowing it to be so well restored that from outside, it has regained its original appearance, and inside, in the Säulenhalle (“Hall of Columns”), the turned, four- to five-metre-tall oaken columns have been preserved. What brings this house to the cultural-historical fore is its balcony made of turned oak logs and with oaken balustrades. The builder F. Ch. Heusner's family came from Franconia, where, having taken Italy as a model, balconies standing on columns were quite widespread. In the present, because most in Germany were wooden, only a very few have been saved from then. Besides Ulm (\\"3-Kannen-Anlage\\"), the balcony in Dhronecken could well be one of the biggest.

Geography   Location  Erden lies on the Moselle’s right bank surrounded by vineyards in the great bow in the river between Bernkastel-Kues and Traben-Trarbach, where the valley spreads out into very flat country bordering on the Hunsrück. Over on the opposite bank, steep slopes lead up to the Eifel. Erden belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Nearby communities  Neighbouring places are Lösnich and Zeltingen-Rachtig, and across the river, Ürzig. The nearest middle centres are Bernkastel-Kues, some 8 km away, as the crow flies, and the district seat, Wittlich, some 10 km away. To Trier it is about 38 km.  Climate  Erden lies in a transitional zone between temperate oceanic climate and continental climate; compared to other regions in Germany, a very mild and sunny climate prevails here. In nearby Brauneberg on 11 August 1998, a record temperature of 41.2 °C in the shade, the highest ever air temperature recorded in the Federal Republic, was confirmed. The barrier formed by the Eifel shields Erden from west winds, putting it in a rain shadow and sometimes subjecting it to a föhn effect. At the same time, the warming of the air is favoured by the only slight exchange of air with the surrounding area. Tied in with this is the high humidity due to ongoing evaporation of water from the Moselle, which, especially in summer, makes at times for heavy and muggy weather, and which also brings many storms along with it.  History   La Tène and Roman times  As early as 500 BC, in La Tène times, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, settled in Western and Central Europe. Celtic graves bear witness to this. In Roman times, what is now today's municipality might well have been within the territory of the provincial capital, Trier; presumably, as state domain, it was involved in the town's provisioning. Across from Erden were found two ancient winepressing facilities, one of which was Germany's oldest such Roman facility. Onto this in the 4th century AD was built a smokehouse, a so-called fumarium, to age wine more quickly with smoke. This is confirmed by digs done by the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Trier.  Middle Ages  In Francia, Erden remained a kingly estate and belonged to the Fiscus of Kröv, which after being transferred from the king's control in the 13th century to the Counts Palatine of the Rhine was pledged, ending up in the hands of the Counts of Sponheim. About 774 or 775, the name Erden appeared for the first time in writing: in pago Muslense super fluvio Muselle in monte Ardinigo, it says in a document from the Abbey of Echternach. “Erden” means “high” or “steep”. The splintering of the Fiscus of Kröv was parallelled by one in Erden, where in the Early Middle Ages the Bishop of Toul, or rather his Abbey of Saint-Èvre de Toul, acquired extensive holdings. These might well have stemmed from the Pippinids, who had holdings in the Moselle country, and they were sold in 1266 to the Vögte of Hunolstein. In Carolingian times, the Royal Abbey of Echternach appears, provided with holdings in Erden. Following in the High and Late Middle Ages were the Cistercian Himmerod Abbey and other monasteries and foundations, among them Machern Monastery, Springiersbach Monastery, Ören, St. Maximin's Abbey, Ravengiersburg and others. The Sponheims’ share of the landholdings in Erden was surely the biggest, though the Counts gave parts thereof out as castle fiefs. Sponheim was also the liege lord of the Vögte of Hunolstein, and asserted, through the blood court, hegemony over the Kröver Reich (a kingly estate named for Kröv) until the late 18th century, and then only when the Vögte of Hunolstein sold their holdings to the Archbishopric of Trier. The Faßbodenzoll (“barrel-bottom duty”) in Erden, which might have been an old Fiscus privilege, but which was not witnessed until quite late, and the Mühlenbann (an arrangement giving the lord the exclusive right to own and run mills, and obliging all his subjects to use his mills exclusively) ensured that the Sponheim administration's hold on Erden was fast. Through part of the Hunolsteins’ holdings being further bequeathed within their family until 1786, Erden retained its Ingericht (court), which was independent of the Electorate of Trier. Quite handsome holdings that had come from the Imperial estate were also held by a knightly family that named itself after Erden, but these passed in 1347 to the St. Paulin Foundation in Trier. Ecclesiastically, Erden's Aperkapelle, a chapel whose founding might have gone back to the Abbey of St. Èvre, belonged to the parish of Lösnich, which by way of the Abbey of Mönchengladbach and the Counts of Sayn fell in the 13th century to the Teutonic Knights. The parish seat was moved in the late 13th century to Rachtig. Saint Èvre's patronage of Erden was by the 17th century forgotten. Since then, Saint Anne has been held to be patron saint. The abolition of church tithes by the French Revolution brought about Erden's shift from membership in the Rachtig parish league and the acquisition of its own pastor.  Modern times  After the transitional period under the French, which brought along with it the dissolution of the old structures, Erden, and the Kröver Reich, too, passed to the district of Bernkastel in the Regierungsbezirk of Trier, themselves part of Prussia’s Rhine Province. Since 1946, Erden has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Culture and sightseeing   Village culture  Erden is characterized by winegrowing; even today there are still more than a dozen winemaking businesses. The best known among these is the Erdener Treppchen. A volunteer fire brigade, a parish community and several clubs characterize the village’s cultural life. In a play on the first line in the Bible, Erden, jokingly, likes to call itself the world’s oldest village. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” reads Genesis 1:1, or as Erdeners like to say in German as “proof” of their village's age: Am Anfang schuf Gott Himmel und Erde[n], “Erde” being German for “earth” in fact. Worth seeing in Erden are the church, various wayside crosses and old winemaking houses, as well as the Roman winepressing facilities across the Moselle.  Regular events  Local history and wine festivals are regularly held, among which are the Wine and Fountain Festival, the Erden Wine Fair, the Winemakers’, Wine and Street Festival in late summer and the Parish Festival. In June, the Happy Mosel-Erlebnistag (“Adventure Day”) is also held.  Economy and infrastructure  Winegrowing has from days of yore played an important rôle, even if today the great majority of the population earns a living in other fields. In the 20th century, tourism developed. In Erden is a campground of roughly 1.5 ha as well as many businesses and private citizens with rooms to let with several hundred guest beds. Public transport is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier (VRT), whose fares therefore apply. There are plans to build a bridge over the Upper Moselle, very close to Erden, for the Bundesstraße 50.  Further reading  * Martina Knichel: … und Gott schuf Himmel und ERDEN.

Also admired for her dramatic abilities, she was praised as an actress who \\"textured her vivacity with emotional details.\\"Anonymous, \\"Dame Merle Park\\", online biography, Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. Retrieved 14 September 2015. Early life and training Born in Salisbury, the capital and most populous city of the self-governing British Crown colony of Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), Merle Park was educated in local schools.Christopher Pilcher, \\"Ballet Dancers Born in Rhodesia\\", in The Southern African History Musings of Ross Dix-Peek, website. Retrieved 21 November 2015. As a child she began her dance training with Betty Lamb, a local ballet teacher, and soon showed unusual facility. In 1951, when she was 14, her parents moved the family to England and enrolled her in the Elmhurst School for Dance. Located in Camberley, Surrey, not far from central London, Elmhurst is an independent vocational school for youngsters intent on pursuing a professional career in classical ballet. During her three years there, Park proved to be an outstanding student. She transferred to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in London in 1954, and, after only six months of study, was taken into the corps de ballet of the Sadler's Wells Ballet company, soon to be granted a royal charter and renamed The Royal Ballet.Barbara Newman, \\"Park, Merle\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 5, p. 100. Professional career Park made her stage debut as a rat in the retinue of the wicked fairy Carabosse in The Sleeping Beauty, the ballet staged by Ninette de Valois for the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946, a year after the end of World War II in Europe. From 1955 onward, while still a member of the corps, she was assigned numerous solo roles.Anonymous, \\"Merle Park: Dancer You Will Know\\", Dance and Dancers (London), May 1955, p. 19. At the age of 19, she danced the role of the carefree Milkmaid in Frederick Ashton's popular Façade in the opera house's Silver Jubilee gala on 6 May 1956. Soon thereafter, she was noticed by critics in a sparkling performance of Princess Florine, opposite the Bluebird in act 3 of The Sleeping Beauty.Mary Clarke, \\"Dancers at Covent Garden\\", Dancing Times (London), March 1956, p. 347. Promoted to soloist in 1958, she danced her first Swanhilde, the saucy village lass in Coppélia, and the title character in John Cranko's Pineapple Poll, set to the merry tunes of Arthur Sullivan. She had notable success in both parts, as \\"her small, light frame and fleet, sunny style made her a natural soubrette.\\" Named a principal dancer in 1962, she subsequently danced all the ballerina roles in the classical repertory.Horst Koegler, \\"Park, Dame Merle\\", in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet, 2d ed. (Oxford University Press, 1987). In 1968, Park was cast as Clara in Rudolf Nureyev's production of The Nutcracker, dancing with him in the lyrical duet in act 1 and in the spectacular pas de deux that is the climax of act 2. It proved to be the role that made her a star. A brilliant technician, an accomplished actress, and a glamorous personality on stage, she was also greatly admired as Giselle, as Cinderella, and, particularly, as Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty.Anna Kisselgoff, \\"Ballet: Merle Park in The Sleeping Beauty\\", International New York Times, 29 June 1981. She gave more performances of Giselle than any other artiste in the history of the company. In 1973, she danced the dual role of Odette/Odile in Swan Lake for the first of many acclaimed performances.John Gruen, The Private World of Ballet (New York: Viking, 1975). In the ballets of Frederick Ashton, she shone as Lise in La Fille mal gardée and as Titania in The Dream. Ashton's Symphonic Variations, a plotless work set to the score by César Franck, provided her opportunity to display her musicality and classical precision, as did the role of the Indian temple dancer Nikiya in La Bayadère. In contrast, her impersonation of Kate in Cranko's wildly funny The Taming of the Shrew, set to music by Domenico Scarlatti, sparkled with roguish humor.James Monahan, \\"Cranko's Shrew–Royal Ballet Style\\", Dancing Times (London) April 1977, pp. 282–284. She also gave highly dramatic performances in the title roles of Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet and Manon, set to scores by Serge Prokofiev and Jules Massenet, respectively. Photographs of her in these roles reveal a talented dance actress at work.Anthony Crickmay and P. W. Manchester, Merle Park (Brooklyn, New York: Dance Horizons, 1976). Photos by Crickmay, text by Manchester. Park toured widely on the international ballet circuit with the Royal Ballet, often dancing with such dynamic partners as Nureyev, Anthony Dowell, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. In 1970, she toured the major cities of Rhodesia, her home country, with Royal Ballet principal dancer Petrus Bosman, a native South African, as her partner. Capping her multifaceted career was the role of the Countess Marie Larish in MacMillan's Mayerling (1978), which depicts the final years of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary. As a lady in waiting to Empress Elizabeth and a former mistress of the prince, played by David Wall, she scored a theatrical triumph. Of all the ballets in which Park appeared in her later years, however, none suited her joyous style of dancing better than Voices of Spring (1983), a pas de deux created by Ashton for a New Year's gala performance of Die Fledermaus at the Royal Opera House. Upon entering the party scene, carried aloft by Wayne Eagling, smiling and strewing flower petals, she and he danced Ashton's buoyant choreography to Johann Strauss's famous waltz with great élan and verve, creating an indelible impression of happiness and grace.

Teaching activities In 1977, while still the senior ballerina of the Royal Ballet, Park opened her own school in London and became a popular teacher, as she was able to imbue her students with the joy of dancing as well as instructing them in the basics and fine points of classical technique. A member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, she was named a director of the Royal Ballet School in 1983.Alastair Macauley, \\"Merle Park and the Royal Ballet School\\", interview, Dancing Times (London), March 1998), pp. 506–507. With her mastery of technique and knowledge of style, she was instrumental in maintaining the high standards that made it the preeminent school of classical ballet in the United Kingdom. Honors and awards Park was named Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1974 Queen's Honours List. In 1982, she was the recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award, the highest award bestowed by the Royal Academy of Dance.Ivor Guest, \\"Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award\\", Dance Gazette (London), March 1983, p. 16. Four years later, in 1986, she was honored with the title of Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her services to ballet in the United Kingdom. Personal life Park was married twice. Her first husband was James Monahan, whom she wed in 1965 and with whom she had one child. As the dance critic of The Guardian newspaper in London, he had admired her since early in her career.James Monahan, \\"Antoinette Sibley and Merle Park\\", Dance Magazine (New York), May 1968, p.64.

One peculiarity is the cluster of ecclesiastical names borne by many of the local winemaking locations, such as Himmelreich (“Kingdom of Heaven”), Domprobst (“Cathedral Provost”) and Abtsberg (“Abbot’s Mountain”), which bear lasting witness to the ecclesiastical princes’ and monasteries’ ancient predilection for Graach's wine slopes.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Eifel – indeed in the heights of the Vulkaneifel – and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Wittlich-Land.  History  In 1341, Hasborn had its first documentary mention in a document from Prince- Archbishop-Elector Balduin. The name is interpreted thus: Born means “spring” (cognate with the English “bourne”), while the first syllable is from a Frankish name, Hasso, all of which means that the municipality's name means “Hasso’s Spring”. The village grew out of a farm that that Frank set up near where the former smithy, which was originally (until 1775) a church, later was. Running by this spring was once an old Roman road whose remnants can still be seen in a deep holloway known as der Holg (the standard German word for holloway is Hohlweg). Given this, Hasso's farm might also have been an inn at which travellers rested or changed horses. Indeed, in later times, at what is today the Hotel Thomas, postal coach horses on the Koblenz-Trier stretch of the road were changed. Another origin of Hasborn is believed to have lain in the now long vanished village of Ritzeroth, which supposedly lay in a side valley of the Sammetbach along what is now the road to Oberscheidweiler. The village's existence has only been handed down orally. It might have died out in the Plague during the Middle Ages. Today only the cadastral name “Reizat” recalls this vanished village. Beginning in 1794, Hasborn lay under French rule. In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Culture and sightseeing   Natural monuments   Hasborn Sour Spring  In the Sammetbach valley between Hasborn and Oberscheidweiler, right on the bank of the Sammetbach, lies the Hasborner Sauerbrunnen (“Hasborn Sour Spring”), a spring emerging from, and also encased in, Devonian stone. The springwater is brown in colour and tastes sourish. Responsible for the colour is dissolved iron, and for the taste, carbon dioxide (CO2) of volcanic origin.  Oak grove  The oak grove is a stand of oaktrees in the middle of Hasborn almost 400 years old that is unique in Germany. The local lore has it that it came to be during the Thirty Years' War when marauding bands made it impossible for the farmers to drive their swine to pasture in the surrounding oak forests. Instead, the villagers gathered acorns together in the woods and then cast them at the edge of the village to the animals as fodder. Some acorns were worked into the ground by the creatures, leading to growth.  Schanzley  The Schanzley is a steep crag high over the Sammetbach valley lying deep in the forest and therefore hard to find.  Neuglück coppermine  At the municipal limit with Willwerscheid is found an old, disused coppermine called Neuglück. The entrance is barred by a gate in the mountain, but one can see into the gallery.  Buildings   Alte Kapelle Sankt Rochus  Saint Roch's Old Chapel (Alte Kapelle Sankt Rochus) has a high altar from about 1700 (Dehio). It is a former parish church from 1775 with Stations of the Cross. In 1967 it was deconsecrated and in 1997 and 1998 it underwent renovation both inside and outside by the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz (“German Monument Protection Foundation”). Today it is a cultural centre used for events such as exhibitions, concerts, readings and theatre.  Neue Kirche Sankt Rochus  Saint Roch's New Church (Neue Kirche Sankt Rochus) is a new, modern church with a tent roof in the old oak grove. It was consecrated in 1968. The architect was Böhr from Trier. It has a great organ built by Alfred Führer that was once found in Bergkamen.  Hasborn Mill  The Hasborn Mill (Hasborner Mühle), standing on the Sammetbach and used until 1957 as a flour mill, has stood empty for the last few years.  Woodyard  In Hasborn is found the Rhineland-Palatinate State Forests’ high-grade woodyard. In a broad area, all high-grade wood from far around is kept for inspection and auction. The way to the yard branches off the road to Niederöfflingen or the Maare-Moselle Cycle Path (Maare-Mosel- Radweg) and is signposted.  Photovoltaic complex  In Hasborn is found one of Rhineland-Palatinate's biggest photovoltaic complexes. In 2008, in an area of 23 ha, state-of-the-art elements were installed, right next to the high-grade woodyard.  Sport  At the DJK Hasborn e.V., a sport club with more than 500 members, football, tennis, gymnastics and volleyball are practised. In Hasborn are found a grass football pitch, a training square, a big, multipurpose sport hall and a nine-pin bowling alley at the Hotel Thomas. Moreover, the Maare-Moselle Cycle Path (Maare-Mosel-Radweg) runs along the old disused Eifelbahn (railway) alignment through the municipality.  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  By way of the Hasborn interchange, there is a direct link to the Autobahn A 1\\\\. Through Hasborn runs Landesstraße (State Road) 52, the old linking road between Trier and Koblenz. Buses run to Wittlich and Daun.

The Romans used the springs for baths, and the water from the Viktoria-Quelle was once bottled and sold. Today, both springs are encased to form fountains, but neither is used commercially anymore.

It occupies of woodland, lakes, and lawns. History Thiruvananthapuram Zoo is one of the oldest Zoo in India. Similarly the Museum and Botanical Gardens are also one of the oldest of their kind in the country. Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma,(1816-1846), illustrious King and Music composer who had ruled Travancore during 1830-1846 was the visionary behind the establishment of the Thiruvananthapuram Museum and Zoo,He had a good collection of animals including elephants in his horse breeding centre. To the Trivandrum stables he incorporated a menagerie and kept tigers, panthers cheetahs, deer, bears and a lioness there. It was however left to his brother Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma and the then British Resident General Cullen which resulted in the establishment of Napier Museum and Zoo in Thiruvananthapuram. A committee was formed in 1855 with the Maharaja of Travancore as Patron, General Cullen as president, The Elaya Raja as vice president and Mr. Allen Brown as Secretary of the Committee and the Director of Museum. The Museum was thrown open to the Public in September 1857. But the Museum by itself could not attract the people much, and therefore a Zoo and a park were started in 1859.The zoo was originally built with the typical iron-barred cages prevalent at the time, and was designed for recreational purposes, but with increased loss of forest and wildlife due to human development, the goal of the Zoo has changed from recreation to conservation. Asiatic lions in Thiruvananthapuram Zoo A modernization project started in 1995, aims to gradually replace the old enclosures with spacious naturalistic enclosures. The state government of Kerala is undertaking this renovation with financial and technical help from the Central Zoo Authority. Black bear in Thiruvananthapuram Zoo Animals The Thiruvananthapuram Zoo is home to 82 species from around the world. Indigenous species at the zoo include lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri langur, Indian rhinoceros, Asiatic lion, royal Bengal tiger, white tiger and leopard, as well as nine Asian elephants (as of 31 March 2009). in 2020, animals from Africa include giraffes, hippos, zebras, and Cape buffalos.

Definition Lawrence Lin has the form of the concordance correlation coefficient \\\\rho_c as :\\\\rho_c = \\\\frac{2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_x\\\\sigma_y}{\\\\sigma_x^2 + \\\\sigma_y^2 + (\\\\mu_x - \\\\mu_y)^2}, where \\\\mu_x and \\\\mu_y are the means for the two variables and \\\\sigma^2_x and \\\\sigma^2_y are the corresponding variances. \\\\rho is the correlation coefficient between the two variables. This follows from its definition as :\\\\rho_c = 1 - \\\\frac{{\\\\rm Expected\\\\ orthogonal\\\\ squared\\\\ distance\\\\ from\\\\ the\\\\ diagonal\\\\ }x=y} {{\\\\rm Expected\\\\ orthogonal\\\\ squared\\\\ distance\\\\ from\\\\ the\\\\ diagonal\\\\ }x=y{\\\\rm \\\\ assuming\\\\ independence}}. When the concordance correlation coefficient is computed on a N-length data set (i.e., N paired data values (x_n, y_n), for n=1,...,N), the form is :\\\\hat{\\\\rho}_c = \\\\frac{2 s_{xy}}{s_x^2 + s_y^2 + (\\\\bar{x} - \\\\bar{y})^2}, where the mean is computed as :\\\\bar{x} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^N x_n and the variance :s_x^2 = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^N (x_n - \\\\bar{x})^2 and the covariance :s_{xy} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^N (x_n - \\\\bar{x})(y_n - \\\\bar{y}) . Whereas the ordinary correlation coefficient (Pearson's) is immune to whether the biased or unbiased versions for estimation of the variance is used, the concordance correlation coefficient is not. In the original article Lin suggested the 1/N normalization, while in another article Nickerson appears to have used the 1/(N-1), i.e., the concordance correlation coefficient may be computed slightly differently between implementations. Relation to other measures of correlation The concordance correlation coefficient is nearly identical to some of the measures called intra-class correlations. Comparisons of the concordance correlation coefficient with an \\"ordinary\\" intraclass correlation on different data sets found only small differences between the two correlations, in one case on the third decimal. It has also been stated that the ideas for concordance correlation coefficient \\"are quite similar to results already published by Krippendorff in 1970\\". In the original article Lin suggested a form for multiple classes (not just 2). Over ten years later a correction to this form was issued. One example of the use of the concordance correlation coefficient is in a comparison of analysis method for functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. External links * Statistical Calculator. Provided by NIWA, it is an online version of Lin’s concordance used to assess the degree of agreement between two continuous variables, such as chemical or microbiological concentrations. It calculates the value of Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient. Values of ±1 denote perfect concordance and discordance; a value of zero denotes its complete absence. Statistical testing procedures for Cohen's kappa and for Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient are included in the calculator. These procedures guard against the risk of claiming good agreement when that has happened merely by \\"good luck\\".

Each episode is roughly 12 minutes long, and is usually broken up into three or four segments. The title is the German version of the French loan word carambolage, which means \\"carom\\" or \\"collision\\". As such, Karambolage aims to explore the differences, similarities, and overlaps of French and German culture through anecdotes, household objects that are common in one country, yet virtually unknown in the other, as well as brief, tongue-in-cheek lectures by etymologists, historians, and the like. The anecdotal segments are often accompanied by simple, stylized animation. In recent years, the makers of the series have also included segments dedicated to the experiences of members of the larger immigrant populations of both countries; i.e. the Turks in Germany and the West- and North Africans in France. At the end of each episode, viewers can participate in a sort of guessing game, in which a thirty second long video recording of a public place is shown. Participants are then asked to determine whether the shot was recorded in Germany or France based on the presence of a key detail, such as road signs or businesses unique to that country. Anyone who can determine the country and name the key detail can then mail the solution to arte by postcard or submit it on the station's website. From the correct solutions, ten winners are randomly pulled and receive a small prize.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies surrounded by vineyards in the natural and cultivated landscape of the Moselle valley in the Trier region. Kesten is found in a small hollow on the river’s left bank. The nearest middle centres are the double town of Bernkastel-Kues and the district seat, Wittlich. The university city of Trier lies roughly 28 km away as the crow flies. Kesten belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Climate  The town lies in a transitional zone between temperate oceanic climate and continental climate; compared to other regions in Germany, a very warm and sunny climate prevails here. In neighbouring Brauneberg on 11 August 1998, a record temperature of 41.2 °C in the shade, the highest ever air temperature recorded in the Federal Republic, was confirmed. The barrier formed by the Eifel shields Kesten from west winds, putting it in a rain shadow and sometimes subjecting it to a föhn effect. At the same time, the warming of the air is favoured by the only slight exchange of air with the surrounding area. Tied in with this is the high humidity due to ongoing evaporation of water from the Moselle, which, especially in summer, makes at times for heavy and muggy weather, and which also brings many storms along with it.  History  Romanticized view from 1838 In 936, Kesten had its first documentary mention, thus allowing Kesten to look back on a history of more than a thousand years.

The municipality’s first documentary mention came under the Carolingian king Lothair II in 862. Kröv was part of the Kröver Reich (a royal estate named for Kröv). The village belonged until 1815 to the Département de la Sarre, and after Napoleon’s final defeat, to Prussia. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate. The Nazi and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach withdrew to Kröv after his release from prison in 1966, dying and being buried here several years later (1974).

The Burscheider Mauer is a Celtic ringwall that was used as a refuge castle.Kulturdatenbank Region Trier (1) In 1157, Landscheid had its first documentary mention as Langescheit. Today’s outlying centre of Burg was first mentioned in a written document in 1184, as was Niederkail in 1211. The landlord was Himmerod Abbey, and the overlord was the Archbishopric of Trier. Another sourceKulturdatenbank Region Trier (2) says that in 1070, Niederkail was mentioned as the nobleman Godefried von der Keyle’s home. Beginning in 1794, the Landscheid area lay under French rule. In 1815, it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The blue crozier symbolises Abbess Gertrude of Nivelles, who is the church’s patron. The six-spoked golden wheel was taken from the arms formerly borne by the once self-administering municipality of Niederkail. It symbolises both itinerant trade and agriculture.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Eifel and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Wittlich-Land.  History  The “Laufeld Culture” (Hallstatt times, about 700 BC) took its name from a great burying ground that had been found near Laufeld. In 1344, King John of Luxembourg acquired from the Abbey of Echternach the Hof Laufeld (“Laufeld Estate”). Shortly thereafter, this ended up in the ownership of the Counts of Manderscheid. Beginning in 1794, Laufeld lay under French rule. In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale azure a churchtower argent with conical roof, door and two windows in pale sable and argent a cross flory gules, in a base Or a fess dancetty of the fourth. The three charges all come from Laufeld's history. The churchtower on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side was part of the only parish church in the County of Manderscheid, and was important as a defensive structure as well. Given its importance, it has found its way into the municipality's arms. The cross with lilylike ends to its arms (“cross flory”) on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side was an heraldic charge borne by the Abbey of Echternach, once the village's landlord in the Middle Ages. The zigzag stripe (“fess dancetty”) in the escutcheon’s base was the heraldic device borne by the Counts of Manderscheid, who held sway here from the 14th century until the French Revolution. With approval from the Regierungsbezirk government in Trier on 2 May 1983, Laufeld was granted the right to bear its own arms.  Culture and sightseeing  Worth seeing in Laufeld is the Doll and Toy Museum (Puppen- und Spielzeugmuseum). On display are dolls and playthings from the last 100 years as well as everyday objects from the 1950s. The Laufeld educational nature path teaches about the forest ecosystem.  Economy and infrastructure  Laufeld is a state-recognized recreational municipality (Erholungsort). There are two commercial areas with 20 firms and more than 500 jobs.

In 2014 Mentone Girls' Grammar School became the first school in the world to receive the Certificate of International Education with the Council of International Schools (CIS). History Mentone Girls' Grammar School was established in 1899 as the Mentone High School for Girls, by the four Simpson sisters at \\"Cobbalanna\\", in Como Parade, Mentone. \\"Cobbalanna\\" is now the name given to the new Senior College. In 1924, the school was re-opened as the Mentone Girls' Grammar School (St. Margaret's) under the leadership of the then headmistress, Evaline Mary Pearson. Mentone Girls' Grammar became affiliated with the Church of England in 1962, and subsequently the bishop's mitre was added to the school crest. Parts of the campus are named after recent headmistresses and headmaster. For example, the Prudence Lewty hall was named after former headmistress Prudence Lewty. Campus Mentone Girls' Grammar School is located on single campus in suburban Mentone, directly adjacent to Mentone Beach. Features of the campus include: a pre-tertiary learning centre for students in Years 11 and 12 known as the \\"Cobbalanna Senior College\\", the Junior School with specialised facilities, the Simpson Art Centre with facilities for photography and ceramics, \\"The Bay Cafe\\" is a cafeteria style lunch space, the David Hunt centre utilized for performing arts, the Annette Kellerman science wing and pool, named for the underwater ballerina of the same name, whose mother was a member of staff at the school during the 1920s, library, multi-media laboratories, and performing arts spaces. Sporting facilities include tennis courts, a gymnasium, a 25-metre outdoor heated swimming pool and a smaller indoor heated pool used by the ELC and Prep students. The school also makes use of outside facilities such as Mentone Beach. Recently Mentone Girls' Grammar released their plans for the Wellbeing Precinct, transforming one third of the entire campus to make way for facilities such as an indoor pool with diving boards, multi-purpose courts for netball and basketball, and a synthetic multi-use pitch for soccer, hockey and tennis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfbiwohuNDY School crest The Mentone Girls' Grammar School crest was designed in 1924, by Headmistress, Mary Pearson. To complement the school crest, Pearson developed the school motto of Vero Nihil Verius, which may be translated from Latin as \\"Nothing truer than Truth\\". The crest is based on the design of St. George's shield, and is made up of four components: * The three stars represent the Holy Trinity: God the Father; God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. *The three wavy gold lines symbolise the school's location by a bay. *The bishop's mitre was added in 1963 to signify the School's association with the Anglican Church of Australia. *The colours of murrey, blue and gold, also add significance. Murrey, a traditional heraldic colour, represents the blood of Christ. Blue represents both the sky and the water and indicates the height and depth of learning. Gold represents the sands of the shore. Former Headmistress, Prudence Lewty and Bursar Mary Coxall added a laurel wreath around the crest in 1963. In heraldic terms, the laurel wreath identifies heroes returning from battle and technically should only be displayed on crests which have been carried into battle. For this reason the laurel wreath was removed in 1999.Mentone Girls' Grammar School- School crest (accessed:15-06-2007) Houses There are 4 Houses at Mentone Girls Grammar School. *Grammar House (Red) *St Margaret's (Saints) House (Gold) *McCowan House (Green) *Kent House (Blue) Annual house competitions include House Athletics, House Cross Country, House Swimming, House Enterprise, House Music, House Dance and House Aerobics.

Climate  Niederöfflingen lies in a transitional zone between temperate oceanic climate and continental climate with its attendant mild winters and warm summers.  History  Niederöfflingen's history reaches all the way back to 785 when Charlemagne donated the villa … Officinus (Niederöfflingen) to the Abbey of Echternach.Goldenes Buch der Abtei Echternach, Gotha, fol.48v-50 As early as 1179, the Abbey of Echternach forsook its holding of Niederöfflingen in Archbishop of Trier Arnold's favour,Goldenes Buch der Abtei Echternach, Gotha, fol.102v und 103 thus making it an Electoral-Trier holding. Niederöfflingen was assigned to the Amt of Manderscheid and was part of the high court of Obermanderscheid.Staatsarchiv Luxemburg nach Archiv Gotha und LHA Koblenz, Abt.1C, Nr.4207 In the Nine Years' War (1688-1697; known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), the Sun King's (Louis XIV of France) soldiers laid great swathes of the Eifel country in rubble and ashes. Under the Treaty of Ryswick, the Eifel country was for almost a hundred years freed of French hegemony.F.Textor, Entfestungen und Zerstörungen im Rheingebiet während des 17. Jahrhunderts als Mittel der französischen Rheinpolitik, Bonn 1937, S.61 According to the 1702 taxation rolls, 20 families were living in 18 houses in the early 18th century. This was six fewer houses than there had been in 1563, now that the wars in the 17th century had wrought their havoc.StA.Trier, Abt.L10, Nr.10 In the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1794), the French conquered the Eifel.M.Müller, Säkularisation und Grundbesitz, Zur Sozialgeschichte des Saar-Mosel-Raumes 1794-1813, Boppard 1980, S.25 Established as administrative units on the French model were departments, which in turn were subdivided into arrondissements and cantons. On 30 July 1802, the Mayoralty (Bürgermeisterei in German; Mairie in French) of Niederöfflingen came into being, encompassing the centres of Niederöfflingen, Gipperath, Greimerath, Hasborn, Oberscheidweiler and Niederscheidweiler.LHA Koblenz, Abt.54 C17, Nr.5 In 1814, French times came to an end in the Eifel, which as a result of the Congress of Vienna was assigned to Prussia. The municipal structure introduced by the French, however, still lasted 30 years beyond this time, before it was swept away in 1845 by the Prussian structure. Even the civil registry (baptisms, marriages and deaths) introduced by Napoleon was carried on by the new administration.Gesetz-Sammlung für die Königlichen Preußischen Staaten, 1845, S.523ff The Mayoralty – later Amt – of Niederöfflingen existed until 1934. In this year, the Ämter of Laufeld and Niederöfflingen were abolished and united with the Amt of Manderscheid.Archiv VG-Manderscheid, Beschlußbücher der Ämter Manderscheid, Niederöfflingen und Laufeld American troops arrived in March 1945, whereupon the time of the Third Reich in Niederöfflingen came to an end. The last great administrative reform, which was introduced in 1968, led to the municipality being grouped into the Verbandsgemeinde of Manderscheid, since 2014 the Verbandsgemeinde Wittlich-Land. Since the 1970s, a modern multipurpose community hall has been built as a wing on the old school, three new development areas have been laid out, a village square with a fountain has been built and Donatusstraße has been remodelled and expanded as a village thoroughfare.Sitzungsniederschriften der Gem.

The cross on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side refers to Niederöfflingen's centuries-long allegiance to the Electorate of Trier.

A new building of Saint Edeltrudis's Church was built in 1822, for which stonecarving from the destroyed Himmerod Abbey was used for doors and windows, and also a portal. When building work finished on the new church, the parish obtained a new high altar in 1826.Wackenroder, Kunstdenkmäler, S.234 In 1956, the Baroque altar was restored and \\"it was given as a new adornment a figure of Saint Edeltrudis, a carved work from the year 1500, that has stood in the Edeltrudis Chapel ever since …\\".D.Nohn, Niederöfflingen, S.39 In the autumn of 1970, extensive renovations were begun: a new heating system was built in and a new floor laid.LHA Koblenz, AB.716, Nr.14, Schulchronik Niederöfflingen On Niederöfflingen's eastern outskirts stands the Edeltrudiskapelle (\\"Saint Edeltrudis’s Chapel\\"). A stone figure of Saint Willibrord is reckoned to be from Romanesque (950-1250) times. Besides a few Gothic figures, there is a walled cross bearing the year 1608. The aforementioned wooden figure of Saint Edeltrudis stems from the end of the 15th century. The chapel was built about 1850 next to a spring. The springwater, which is said to have healing powers, can be taken through a hand-driven pump beside the sandstone basin.Wackenroder, Kunstdenkmäler, S.235 On 4 February 1945, the chapel, in which the Wehrmacht stored their munitions, was utterly destroyed in an explosion. Today's Edeltrudiskapelle, newly built on the same spot, was consecrated on 25 July 1950.Schulchronik Niederöfflingen, II  Religion  As an autonomous parish, Niederöfflingen was listed as early as 1330 in the ecclesiastical taxation rolls. Then, it had to pay 24 solidi. On the occasion of the visitation on 22 February 1657 undertaken under Carl Casper von Leyen, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War were shown.Pfarrchronik Niederöfflingen S.93 ff  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  Through the northeastern part of the municipal area runs the Autobahn A 1, and right through the village itself runs Landesstraße (State Road) 64. Likewise in the northeast runs the Maare-Mosel-Radweg (cycle path) between Daun and Bernkastel-Kues.  Infrastructure  A new commercial area called Auf dem Soll is in planning, as are a new residential area and a solar park in the area known as Auf Heckert. Niederöfflingen has its own community hall, the Wilhelm-Hees-Halle. Along with eight other municipalities, it forms the \\"Öfflingen\\" Forest District (Forstrevier), founding its own forest administration to furnish jobs for forestry workers, to create synergical effects in cultivating the woodlands and employing the forestry workers and to have a highly mechanized wood harvest with optimal added value. Since February 1999, a forest kindergarten has been part of the local kindergarten, which is also attended by children from neighbouring places. The forest kindergarten's quality feature, besides forest paedagogy, is the naturalistic, as well as holistic and nature-oriented, work with the children.  Tourism  Through the municipal area run the mountainbike trails \\"Alfbach\\" (Tour 8988) and \\"Wittlich Landesblick\\" (Tour 6696), as well as VulkanBike Trailpark's Tour 3 Manderscheid (Burgen-Schluchten-Maare – \\"Castles-Gorges-Maars\\"). Along the river Lambach, one can reach on foot the river Lieser, which one can then follow along the Lieserpfad, a hiking trail, maintained by the Eifel Club, to Daun or Wittlich.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess, gules a cross flory argent and bendy of seven of the second and the first. The arms were designed by Karl E. Becker. The \\"cross flory\\" (that is, cross with lilylike ends to its arms) is the heraldic device borne by the Abbey of Echternach, which figures prominently in the village's mediaeval history. Carloman donated the village to the Abbey, a deed later confirmed by Charlemagne. A surviving impression of a seal borne by Heinrich von Ufflingen – Ufflingen being an old form of the name (Ober)Öfflingen – from 1451 shows the same “bendy” (that is, with slanted stripes) pattern now seen in the lower half of the escutcheon. The arms have been borne since 14 October 1982 when they were approved by the Regierungsbezirk administration.Description and explanation of Oberöfflingen’s arms  Culture and sightseeing  Saint Maurice’s Church (Kirche St. Mauritius) comes from the year 1854.

This led to, among many other things, Oberscheidweiler's mention in 1193 as Scheitwilre.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies on the Middle Moselle on a slope set two kilometres back from the river, between the two hills of Hüttenkopf and Rosenberg in a side valley through which a bend in the Moselle flowed in the Tertiary. Osann- Monzel's elevation is some 180 m above sea level. Osann-Monzel belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Wittlich-Land, whose seat is in Wittlich, although that town is itself not part of the Verbandsgemeinde.  Constituent communities  Osann-Monzel's Ortsteile are, as the name suggests, Osann and Monzel. They were merged to form today's municipality in 1969.  History  The Osann- Monzel area is believed to have first been settled in Roman times after Julius Caesar (100 BC – 44 BC) had absorbed the Eifel and the Moselle into the Roman Empire. Within Monzel's limits, rubble was found that was interpreted as having been a Roman villa rustica, that is, an agricultural homestead. After the end of Roman hegemony, the municipality belonged, beginning in 510, to Francia, and after that kingdom's division in the mid 9th century to Lotharingia. Lotharingia, for its part, switched allegiances between the East Frankish and West Frankish kingdoms. In the end, the municipal area belonged, beginning in 925, albeit with interruptions, to Germany's western border area. No direct documentary mentionings from these times are known. Nevertheless, it is assumed that both Osann and Monzel were founded as early as the 7th or 8th century. At least it's certain that these places arose no later than 950. This follows from an inventory of holdings made at that time by Saint Martin's Abbey in Trier in which osanna and muncele villam are named. This first documentary mention has been dated to 1008.The oldest known documentary mention of the places Osann and Monzel is found in the appendix of “Vita Magnerici”, a biography of Saint Magneric, Bishop of Trier (570-596). This document, which contains no date, is reckoned to be from 1008, while the appendix might well have been attached sometime between 1020 and 1040. The appendix is a listing of the holdings that still belonged to Saint Martin’s Abbey in Trier about 950 before it was stripped of them by the Archbishop of Trier. Also mentioned here besides Osann and Monzel are Wehlen (today an outlying centre of Bernkastel-Kues), Longkamp, Kommen, Salmrohr (today an outlying centre of Salmtal), Fastrau (today an outlying centre of Fell), Mertloch, Bitburg, Reinig (today an outlying centre of Wasserliesch) and a place named Eweson which is nowadays unknown. Archbishop Balduin von Trier enfeoffed the Count of Saarbrücken-Nassau with Monzel and Osann in 1323; however, another important landholder in Monzel remained Himmerod Abbey. In 1412, the fiefholder at the time, Philipp von Nassau-Saarbrücken, further enfeoffed the Count of Daun and at Bruch with Osann and Monzel as a “subfief”, leading to Osann's and Monzel's becoming, through a dowry, part of the possessions held by the Counts of Manderscheid. From 1794 on, both Osann and Monzel lay under French rule. In 1815 they were assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. From 1946, they were part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1969, the two municipalities were dissolved, and out of them was formed the new municipality of Osann-Monzel on 7 June 1969.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies surrounded by vineyards, meadows and woods in the Moselle valley between Bernkastel-Kues and Trier. It is the biggest winegrowing centre in the Mosel wine region. Piesport is found on the river’s right bank where the valley begins to broaden out into country marked by utterly flat riverbank slopes. On the other side of the river, steep slopes lead up to the Eifel. Piesport belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Constituent communities  Piesport’s Ortsteile are Piesport, Niederemmel (Emmel, Reinsport and Müstert) and Ferres.  Climate  Yearly precipitation in Piesport amounts to 737 mm, falling into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 49% of the German Weather Service’s weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is twice what it is in February. Precipitation varies only minimally and is extremely evenly spread throughout the year. At only 3% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.  History  The region around Piesport was settled as early as Roman times by the Romans. “Like an amphitheatre’s rows”, wrote the poet Ausonius, the vineyards framed the place. Between the centres of Alt-Piesport and Ferres, the biggest Roman wine pressing facility north of the Alps was unearthed in 1985, and partly reconstructed. It is the focus of the yearly Römisches Kelterfest (“Roman Wine Press Festival”) held on the second weekend in October. Other Roman finds have led to the conclusion that the village was once an important port. It was dedicated to Bigontius, a local deity, whence the name Porto Pigonto was derived, which eventually mutated into “Piesport”. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, Piesport belonged to the Electorate of Trier. Beginning in 1794, Piesport lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The craggy massif that rises steeply out of the Moselle allows no transport links downstream, nor is there even any room for a footpath. Nevertheless, here and there on its steep slopes are found vineyards. For a decade in the 1930s, there was mining here. Above the Moselloreley runs a hiking trail.  Winegrowing  Piesport is to a considerable extent characterized by winegrowing, and with 413 ha of vineyard area under cultivation is by far the biggest winegrowing centre in the Mosel wine region. Traditionally it is mainly Riesling grapes that are grown here. The municipality is part of the wine area of Bernkastel. The vineyards are part of the winemaking appellation – Großlage – of Michelsberg.

Early life and education Gates was born in 1863 in Atlanta, Georgia. U.S. Passport Applications 1795-1925: William E. Gates 14 June 1917 His parents were William H. Gates (1833 in NY - 1901) and Katherine Appley. Gates' grandfather was Horatio Gates. Gates attended school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Johns Hopkins University and University of Virginia. He graduated in 1886 with a law degree. The following year he moved to Cleveland, Ohio. He ran a printing company. Mayan studies In 1898 he bought a copy of the Codex Troano. This triggered his interest in Maya culture. In 1900 he retired from his work in printing. He relocated to San Diego, California. He became involved in theosophy. He moved to a theosophy colony called the Aryan Theosophical Colony. It was located in Point Loma, a neighborhood of San Diego. He started teaching antiquities at the colony college. While teaching, he researched and published about Mayan culture and language. He started building his own collection of Mayan documentation, including manuscripts and photographs of manuscripts. By 1910 he had published the Paris Codex. Two years later, he started exploring how comparing different Mayan languages could help make further discoveries about Mayan hieroglyphs. He departed from New Orleans in June 1917 to visit Guatemala for archaeological research. He started, and served as president of, the Maya Society at Philadelphia in 1920. He started working for the Archaeology Commission of the Maryland Academy of Science as a consultant. The following year he became a researcher at the Carnegie Institution for Science. He discovered a monument dating from 120 BC in on while on a trip in Guatemala. This is credited with solidifying that the Mayan culture was older than originally thought. In 1922, he started working for the Republic of Guatemala as director-general of their archaeology department. He was also the director of the archaeology museum there. Gates was living in Charlottesville, Virginia and traveled to Guatemala, too. After one visit in 1922 he returned to Charlottesville with a K'iche' man he had met. In Charlottesville, Gates studied the K'iche' language using a wave writer. In 1924, Gates became director of the American Indian Defense Association. That year, Tulane University bought half of his Mayan archives. He also started working for Tulane in their Middle American Research department. Gates would, by 1930, sell his farm in Charlottesville, allowing him to sustain his research. He published the first and only issue of the Mayan Society in 1930 through Tulane. It was received poorly by faculty at Tulane and never published again. Gates also published various codices, including the Dresden Codex and Madrid Codex. He was also highly active in developing education and land policies while working for the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1934. Later life and legacy Princeton University acquired the other half of Gates Mayan archives in 1936. The following year, Gates relocated to Washington, D.C. He worked at the Library of Congress and published three editions of A Grammar of Maya in 1938. Gates died in Baltimore, Maryland in 1940.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies surrounded by vineyards in the great bend in the Moselle between Bernkastel-Kues and Traben-Trarbach, not far from Trier. Ürzig is found on the river’s left bank, where very steep slopes rise up to the Eifel. Over the other side of the Moselle, the valley broadens out onto very flat countryside that eventually runs up against the Hunsrück. Ürzig belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Nearby municipalities  Neighbouring municipalities are, among others, Kinheim, Erden, Lösnich and also Zeltingen-Rachtig. The nearest middle centres are the double town of Bernkastel-Kues, some 9 km away, and the district seat, Wittlich, some 8 km away. Trier lies some 37 km away.  Population  The population density is 150 inhabitants per square kilometre. The local speech in the region is Moselle Franconian (Moselfränkisch), part of the Central Franconian dialect group.  Climate  Ürzig lies in a transitional zone between temperate oceanic climate and continental climate; compared to other regions in Germany, a very warm and sunny climate prevails here. In nearby Brauneberg on 11 August 1998, a record temperature of 41.2 °C in the shade, the highest ever air temperature recorded in the Federal Republic, was confirmed at the Meteomedia weather station by Jörg Kachelmann (however, Brauneberg is not said to be Germany’s number-one hotspot because the weather station is not included in official measurements owing to its location on a slate mountain). The barrier formed by the Eifel shields Ürzig from west winds, putting it in a rain shadow and sometimes subjecting it to a föhn effect. At the same time, the warming of the air is favoured by the only slight exchange of air with the surrounding area. Tied in with this is the high humidity due to ongoing evaporation of water from the Moselle, which, especially in summer, makes at times for heavy and muggy weather, and which also brings many storms along with it.  History  Ürzig, 1954 In the surrounding areas, remnants of settlement from the Bronze Age have been found. About 500 BC, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived, settled the region around Trier. Following the Treveri, from roughly 50 BC until AD 500 were the Romans. From times of yore, winegrowing has been an important factor in the economy; foremost among the winegrowers that plied their trade in Ürzig were the monastic wineries, such as Himmerod Abbey and the Springiersbach Carmelite Monastery, whose estates are still preserved.

Knightly families once built three castles here, only one of which has been preserved, and that only as ruins. At the remnants of an old watchtower in the vineyards, a sundial has been installed. In Ürzig, there exist even today several wineries, which mainly grow Riesling. The best known vineyard is the Ürziger Würzgarten, although there is also the less well known Ürziger Goldwingert.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies some 20 km east of Trier and 8 km from the Mehring interchange on the Autobahn A 1\\\\. The municipality lies in the middle of the Hunsrück, whose highest elevation is the nearby Erbeskopf at 816 m above sea level. Talling belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Thalfang am Erbeskopf, whose seat is in the municipality of Thalfang.  History  Beginning in 1112, Talling belonged to the Mark Thalfang, a territory roughly corresponding to today’s Verbandsgemeinde. After the French Revolution, the Rhine’s left bank, and thereby Talling too, were ceded to France in 1794 and 1795. Through a law from 26 March 1798, the French abolished feudal rights in their zone of occupation. To the Mayoralty (Mairie) of Talling belonged the villages of Berglicht, Gielert, Lückenburg, Neunkirchen and Schönberg. After French rule ended, the village passed in 1814 to the Kingdom of Prussia and shortly thereafter was assigned to the Amt of Thalfang. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Partial traces of the old Roman road that led from Trier to Mainz can still be found in the surrounding woods.

The municipality’s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules an oak argent, in base dexter a pair of ploughshares palewise addorsed Or and in base sinister a stylized G, and a base per chevron reversed of the second.The German blazon uses the words Gemärke in G-Form for the “stylized G”, but there seems to be no ready translation for the word Gemärke. The oak stands for forestry in Talling, as well as for the oaktree under monumental protection on Birkenallee. The stylized G stands for the traces of the former outlying centre of Gospert. The ploughshares symbolize agriculture, as does the base with the rather unusual line of partition.  Culture and sightseeing   Clubs  There are two clubs in the municipality, the volunteer fire brigade and the Talling Table Tennis Club 1963.

Veldenz is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Bernkastel- Wittlich district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is the former main seat of the County of Veldenz, once a prominent principality to which belonged 120 villages and towns now in Rhineland-Palatinate and northern Alsace and Lorraine.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Middle Moselle region of valley country marked by even slopes and former oxbows of the Moselle. Veldenz is found on the Moselle's right bank, but does not lie right at the water's edge, but rather some two kilometres back from the river, under the outermost forests of the Hunsrück. Roughly 850 ha of the 1 441 ha municipal area is wooded. About 130 ha is given over to winegrowing. Veldenz belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Bernkastel-Kues, whose seat is in the like- named town.  Nearby municipalities  Neighbouring municipalities are, among others, Burgen and Mülheim. The nearest middle centres are Bernkastel- Kues, some 10 km away, and Wittlich, some 17 km away. Trier lies some 45 km away.  Constituent communities  Veldenz's Ortsteile are Veldenz and Thalveldenz.  Climate  Veldenz lies within the temperate zone; compared to other regions in Germany, a very warm and sunny climate prevails here. In neighbouring Brauneberg on 11 August 1998, a record temperature of 41.2 °C in the shade, the highest ever air temperature recorded in the Federal Republic, was confirmed. Because of its location alee of the Eifel, precipitation from northwest weather systems is often kept away. Ongoing evaporation of water from the Moselle regularly leads to high humidity, which, especially in summer, makes at times for heavy and muggy weather, and which also brings many storms along with it.  History  As early as 500 BC, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived, settled in Veldenz's fertile valley. After them, from about 50 BC to AD 500 came the Romans. Possibly about the year 1129, Gerlach I built a castle, today's Schloss Veldenz. In 1286, Rudolph of Habsburg granted Veldenz town and market rights. By 1444, the castle and its environs had passed to the Counts of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, or between 1543 and 1694 the Principality of Palatinate-Veldenz. In 1752, in Burgen near Veldenz, the widely known robber, Johann Peter Petri, also known as Schwarzer Peter (“Black Peter”), was born. From 1777 to 1797, Veldenz belonged to Bavaria. After French rule as part of Sarre department, it was annexed to Prussia in 1815. In 1835 the Veldenz Lion was adopted as the Bavarian Lion in that kingdom's coat of arms. Even today, many examples of comital building undertakings from the 18th century can be found, among them the town hall.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009. The mayor is Norbert Sproß.

The lion in the inescutcheon is the heraldic charge once borne by the Counts of Veldenz, and the “bendy lozengy” pattern seen on the field is the Wittelsbach dynasty's armorial bearing. In 1835, this lion was adopted by Ludwig I, King of Bavaria into that kingdom's state coat of arms, where it remained as a charge until the end of the First World War when the last Bavarian king, Ludwig III was forced to abdicate as a result of the November Revolution.  Culture and sightseeing   Village culture  In 1993 and 1995, Veldenz won the silver medal of the Federal Republic in the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”); in 2006, the villagers managed to triumph once again in the district and regional contest. In the vineyard locations of Elisenberg, Kirchberg, Mühlberg, Grafschafter Sonnenberg and Carlsberg, there is winegrowing. There still exist today in the municipality about a dozen wineries; Riesling is the customary variety.  Sightseeing  Schloss Veldenz 2007 Well known points of interest are the Villa Romana and Schloss Veldenz. There are other monumental buildings, such as the town hall, a signal tower from the 12th century, a mint, a Celtic wall and museums with various exhibits. Further points of interest are an historical market (Krammarkt), a farmer's garden (Bauerngarten), a wild garden, the Josefinenhöhe (heights), the Pionierfelsen (cliff), many ore and slate mines, the Roter Bohles leisure complex and many imposing cliff formations.  Economy and infrastructure  Winegrowing and tourism play a prominent rôle. In Veldenz there are two village squares, three community houses, a village hall, several barbecue pits, educational paths dealing with both wine and the forest, a memorial, a graveyard, two churches and a sporting ground. Furthermore, Veldenz also has its own primary school, a kindergarten, a youth centre, a football field and four children's playgrounds. In the village is also a regional children's and youth home. Roughly 45 km of hiking trails lead around the village. Public transport in Veldenz is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier (VRT), whose fares therefore apply.

Wintrich became widely known mainly for the “Großer Herrgott” vineyard (whose name means “Great Lord God”). In 1968, an uncommonly big crucifix was installed on the Geyerskopf in the vineyards, which fit the old name. It serves as the winemaking village’s landmark, and can easily be seen both day and night, for it is floodlit then, from a great distance. Riesling is the customary grape variety here, although small quantities of Pinot, Müller-Thurgau, Kerner and Dornfelder are also grown.  Wintricher Passionsspiele  The Wintricher Passionsspiele (Wintrich Passion Plays) have been produced over several weeks every five years since 1902. They portray a part of Jesus Christ’s life. The plays are well attended, with 8,000 playgoers coming for the one-hundred-year jubilee. The production venue is the church in Wintrich, this offering the best suited backdrop. The greater part of the players comes from the Passion Play Club (Passionsspielverein) with its roughly 350 members. Besides the players, the choir is one of the most important elements. The last Passion Plays were held in 2007, meaning that the next ones will not be staged until 2012.  Economy and infrastructure  Near Wintrich is a weir on the Moselle, but no bridge.

Career Military Robb graduated from the United States Air Force Academy Honors Program with a Bachelor of Science in astronautical engineering in 1985 and completed USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) in 1986. During his military career, Robb worked in the area of counterterrorism with the United States Special Operations Command, participating in global operations as a mission commander, pilot and mission planner in El Salvador, Panama, Colombia, Turkey, and Egypt, among others. He resigned his Air Force commission with the rank of Captain in August 1992. After leaving the Air Force, Robb attended Yale University. He graduated with a Masters in public and private management (MPPM) in 1995. Internet analyst After graduating from Yale, Robb was hired by Forrester Research, a technology research company located in Cambridge, MA., in June 1995. He published his first report at Forrester in December 1995, called \\"Internet Computing\\" with George Forrester Colony, the CEO of Forrester, as the editor. Robb was made a senior analyst in January 1996 and led the launch of Forrester's first research service dedicated to covering developments on the Internet, called \\"Interactive Technologies\\". While there, he wrote the reports, \\"Which Web Browser\\" and \\"Which Web Server\\" in early 1996. In summer 1996, he wrote the report \\"Navigation Hubs\\" which predicted that web search services like Yahoo would dominate the Web. In fall 1996, he wrote the Forrester report, \\"Personal Broadcast Networks\\" on the rise of social software — software that allowed people to broadcast their written thoughts, pictures and videos and to subscribe to other people doing the same. For these reports, Robb was awarded Forrester's \\"Best Research\\" award in 1997. Further, the 1997 Forrester Forum (Forrester's annual conference in Boston), was dedicated to the theme of \\"Personal Broadcast Networks\\". Robb has been quoted as an expert source on technological trends by The New York Times, The Economist, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Fortune Magazine, CNBC, Fox News, BBC, and NPR.  Entrepreneur  In 1997, Robb co-founded (with Julio Gomez and Alex Stein) Gomez, a performance measurement company in financial services. Gomez was sold to Compuware Corporation in 2009 for $295 million. While at Gomez, Robb and Julio Gomez created the first Gomez Performance Scorecard at the latter's kitchen table. It was an objective system for ranking the quality of a broker's online offering. The Gomez Scorecards provided objective decision support to hundreds of thousands of people opening online brokerage and banking accounts. With the help of Dann Sheridan, Robb designed and built the Gomez performance measurement system. This system was briefly featured as the \\"online broker weather report\\" on CNBC. The Gomez network checked on the availability of transactions systems that operated at big banks and brokerage firms like Fidelity Investments and JP Morgan. The Gomez network consisted of monitoring servers in 54 cities around the world, on six continents and across 23 different Internet backbones. Measurements were taken every five minutes and reported back in real time.  Social software pioneer  Robb became the president of UserLand Software — a pioneer in the development of XML-RPC, SOAP, RSS, and OPML — in 2001. He became the CEO in 2003. He was the product manager for Radio UserLand, the first RSS aggregator and blog publishing tool in fall 2001. This tool allowed individuals to both publish their work to the Web as a blog and to subscribe to the blogs of other people. Decentralized control over publishing and subscription, as seen in Radio, now serves as the basis for social networking and social software. To educate a growing number of people on the power of social software networks, Robb formed a discussion group called K-Logs, Knowledge Management Weblogs in 2001. This group explored how decentralized publishing and subscription using social software would and could be used. In 2003, Robb signed a deal with Martin Nisenholtz, the CEO of New York Times digital to publish an RSS feed for The New York Times, the first major publication to use RSS.  Military theorist  In 2004, Robb began the blog Global Guerrillas to cover developments in terrorism and guerrilla warfare. In April 2007, he published his book Brave New War, introducing the concept of open-source warfare and superempowered terrorism. The book was featured in The New York Times by the columnist David Brooks. His thesis contributed to the overall understanding of the \\"Global War on Terror\\" and specifically the Iraq War.

Robb is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and Yale University, and he has worked both as a special ops counterterrorism officer and as a successful software executive. In other words, he’s had personal experience both with modern warfare and the sort of information management that is the key to winning it. He’s collected his thoughts in a fast, thought- sparking book, “Brave New War”.\\" Resilient communities In 2006, Robb turned his attention from the international war on terror to the domestic concept of \\"resilient communities\\". The concept was formally introduced in his article \\"Power to the People\\" published in Fast Company in March 2006, and expanded in Brave New War (John Wiley & Sons, 2007). Robb defines resilient communities as a social and economic development in response to a broken bureaucracy. Resilient communities are self-dependent, producing all critical goods (food, water, energy, security, etc.) locally rather than relying on a central supply system. Such communities do not separate themselves from society, but are prepared for any breakdown in society that might arise.

Other places nearby include Ancrum, Ashkirk, Belses, Hassendean, Midlem, Minto House, Old Belses, St Boswells, and Woll. History Lilliesleaf used to be a village and parish in the northwest of Roxburghshire. On the old rail routes, the village was 3 miles west of Belses station, 3.5 NNW of Hassendean station, and 6 SSW of Newtown St Boswells station — all on the Waverley route of the North British railway system. It was picturesquely situated on a ridge of ground which slopes down first steeply to the village, then gradually to Ale Water. Between the village and the river lie fields and meadows. Lilliesleaf consisted mainly of one long narrow street, half a mile in length, which contained the post office, with money order, savings bank, and telegraph departments, 2 inns, 2 schools, and several good shops. There was a subscription library, containing about 1600 volumes of all classes of literature. The houses exhibited considerable diversity, some being thatched and others slated, while old cottages and new villas were not unfrequently found standing close together. Almost without exception, the houses had gardens attached to them, and as a natural consequence, flower-culture was largely engaged in. Owing to the trimness of its gardens, and the beauty of its situation, Lilliesleaf was among the prettiest of the Border villages, and its advantages have been fully appreciated by Scottish artists, who have found in it and its environs charming subjects for their brush. The parish church, built in 1771, and restored in 1883, stands a little way beyond the east end of the village. It is surrounded on three sides by the churchyard, which contains a few curious tombstones, and the remains of an old ivy-grown chapel. The improvements of 1883 changed it from a plain barn-like building to one of taste and elegance. They embraced the addition of a nave and bell-tower, and the remodelling of the interior, in which handsome modern benches took the place of the old 'box- pews.' The lighting of the church has been much improved by the new windows in the nave and the enlargement of the old windows in the transepts. A fine-toned bell, which cost about £100, and weighs 8.5 cwts., has been presented to the church by Mr Edward W. Sprot, younger son of the late Mr Mark Sprot of Riddell. An interesting relic is the old stone font. It was removed from the church at the Reformation, and eventually found its way into the moss, where for a long time it lay buried. It has lately been dug up, and placed at one of the entrance doors of the church. The United Presbyterian church was erected in 1805. Besides the girls' school at the village, built by subscription in 1860 on ground bequeathed by the late Mr Currie of Linthill, there is the public school, once known as the parish school, also at the village, and built in 1822, which, with accommodation for 191 children, had an average attendance of about 135, and a grant of over £134. The inhabitants were chiefly employed in agriculture and trades connected therewith. Village demography Pop. (1861) 325, (1871) 349, (1881) 315, (1891) 302. Lilliesleaf parish Lilliesleaf parish is bounded northwest by Selkirk, north by Bowden, northeast and east by Ancrum, southeast by Minto and Wilton, and west by Ashkirk. Almost all the land in the parish is arable, and what remains is taken up with pasture. The ground is gently undulating, sinking in the northeast to 390 feet above sea-level, and rising thence to 556 feet near the village, 754 near Greatlaws, 711 near Newhouse, and 936 at Black Craig. The soil is mostly loam and clay, and there is little or no sand. The predominant rocks are Silurian and Devonian. A portion of the Waverley route of the North British railway passes through the parish. 'Ancient Riddell's fair domain' belonged till 1823 to a family of that name, whose ancestor Walter de Riddell obtained a charter of Lilliesleaf, Whittunes, etc., about the middle of the 12th century, and who received a baronetcy in 1628. The remoter antiquity of the family has been rested upon the discovery, in the old chapel of Riddell, of two stone coffins, one of which contained 'an earthen pot, filled with ashes and arms, bearing a legible date, a.d. 727,' while the other was filled with ' the bones of a man of gigantic size.' These coffins, it has been conjectured, contained the remains of ancestors of the family, although this view has been rejected by Sir Walter B. Riddell. Lilliesleaf Moor was the scene of many ' Conventicles ' held by the Covenanters, and upon it took place several skirmishes between them and their opponents. The chief engagement occurred at Bewlie Moss. This parish is in the presbytery of Selkirk and synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The stipend amounts to £320 with manse. The old church of Lilliesleaf belonged before the year 1116 to the Church of Glasgow, whose right over it was confirmed by several Papal Bulls. A church which also belonged to the See of Glasgow, stood at Hermiston or Herdmanstown, and in addition to it, there were chapels at Riddell (where Riddell Mill now stands) and at Chapel (on the present site of Chapel Farm). Demography Pop. (1881) 718, (1891) 649.— Ord. Sur., shs. 17, 25, 1864-65. Modern village Lilliesleaf from the air Blackadder conventicle on Lilliesleaf Moor. Robert Bennet of Chesters was in the crowd and sent the people home; they did not dismiss at the threats of the soldiers. To the north of Lilliesleaf is the Ale Water which runs east to west. To the east of the village is the sports field and where the Ale runs beside it, lies \\"Postie's Pool.\\" The legend of this pool, passed from child to child in the village, states that a local postie used to ford the river here on the way to the Riddell estate. One day he was crossing the river when he became entangled in the weeds in the pool and drowned. The pool was a popular place during the 1990s for people to cool off during hot weather. The wetland named \\"The Moss\\" is to the south of Lilliesleaf as is the Stank - a bridleway used by walkers. This path runs beside what is locally known as the \\"Elephant House\\", so named after a travelling circus housed an elephant within its four walls. The field directly to the east of the Stank was home to the best sledging hill in the village. Every winter kids could be seen on sledges, bin bags and even surfboards, trying to see who could go the fastest and furthest, trying to reach the iced frozen overflow from the Moss at the bottom of the field. To the north of the village a single track road - the Wynd - runs down to the Ale. The ford and footbridge across the river can be found at this stretch of the Ale. As can the \\"Deep Corner\\" slightly further along and round a bend. This corner was a popular place for cooling off and also for fishing for eels. Near to this was the old rope swing which provided much enjoyment for local children. In covenanting times, conventicles were held on Lilliesleaf moor. Lilliesleaf currently has two pubs, the Cross Keys and the Plough. There is also a cafe named \\"The Jammy Coo\\" which sells food, drinks, paintings and jewelry. Lilliesleaf has a primary school and one church in current use. There is also a village hall - the Currie Memorial Hall - located next to the school and was at one time opposite a field, now replaced by housing. The village is part of the Selkirk High School catchment area and the local children will generally attend this upon finishing primary school. There is no regular public transport in Lilliesleaf. Lilliesleaf has no shops, but use to have a hardware shop, post office (with a hairdresser in its back room), a pottery and a grocer (Haldane's), all of which closed down in the 1990s. For a short time in the 90s there was also a fishmonger and an antique shop as well but neither lasted long. On Sundays certain local residents took on the responsibility of providing Sunday papers for the village and it was common place to see people queuing at no 5 Muselie Drive for their papers and fresh rolls. After this practice ended there was a number of years before the Sunday papers were once again available in the village. This time they were delivered to people's houses by boys going round the village with the papers in the wooden bogie. The village has one play park at the bottom of Muselie Drive which has seen many changes.

The organization's focus on realigning Haskalah and tradition among European Jews was met with opposition from some maskilim. By 1864, nonethelessss, the number of subscribers stood at 1,200. Among its early publications were Luzzatto's 1864 edition of Judah Halevi's Diwan, Salomon Buber's edition of the Pesikta de-Rav Kahana (1868), and parts of Isaac Lampronti's rabbinic encyclopedia (1864–74).

The Uncle Devil Show is a trio consisting of Jason Barr, Langton Herring and Terrence, the three of whom bear striking resemblances to three semi-famous to famous contemporary Scottish musicians. The band have a decidedly surreal quality surrounding them, and their songs tend to deal with topics and themes uncommonly found in popular music – namely, the theft of a bicycle which grants freedom but which breeds contempt, feelings of sympathy for wasps and bees, the practical application of Gilbert O'Sullivan's music and its ability to help sift out inappropriate partners, talentless TV 'talent', and cross- dressing desperates. The record contains the odd occasion of incongruous (and congruous) swearing. But while some might dismiss their efforts as satire or parody, or a one-off joke, there is a lot of evidence that this venture has a lot of thought and heart behind it, and the music and some of the lyrics follow a very well-trodden pop path. The music itself features catchy guitars, vocal harmonies and, at times, rising orchestration and strings. The lyrics explore love affairs gone wrong, from being misled by signs that things were going to work out, only to find they did not, to being in love with a woman who seems desirably, and uncharacteristically for pop songs, real and lovable. Many reviews have referred to the rewards to be gained from multiple listens. Production A Terrible Beauty was produced by The Uncle Devil Show and mastered by Paul McGeechan.

WelTec was formed in 2001 by an amalgamation between the Central Institute of Technology (established in 1960) and the Hutt Valley Polytechnic (established in 1904) In 2020, WelTec, along with 15 other national polytechnics, became subsidiaries of the New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology. WelTec delivers vocational education to about 8000 students every year. WelTec offers over 130 courses in disciplines ranging from hospitality, business, information technology, visual arts, counselling, engineering, construction and creativity.  History   Formation of Petone Technical School and name changes (1904–1960)  WelTec was formed in 1904 as the Petone Technical School at a different site in rented buildings. In 1908 the polytechnic moved to its current site in Petone on Kensington Avenue. The polytechnic went through multiple name changes; including Petone Technical College, Hutt Valley Memorial Technical College, Petone Technical Institute and Hutt Valley Polytechnic.  Central Institute of Technology (1960–2000)   Formation  The Central Institute of Technology (or CIT) was a polytechnic formed in 1960, originally as the Central Technical College before its name change in 1963. The polytechnic was originally based in the Petone Technical College. Construction of the Heretaunga site began in 1970, with the site moving in stages to the new campus. The first stage of pharmacy, science and engineering departments, consisting of three lecture theatres and a block of classrooms, was opened by the Prime Minister at the time, Norman Kirk, on 27 April 1973. The second stage, a halls of residence, consisted of a seven-storey tower block providing accommodation for up to 500 students, along with training facilities for the polytechnics hotel administration courses. The halls of residence opened in February 1978. The third stage added a library, a television production studio, computer-training facilities, areas for training in heating, ventilation, and aeronautics, along with buildings for the management school. The fourth and final stage implemented health science facilities. Courses were transferred from Petone as Heretaunga facilities were completed.  Transfer of health sciences and protests  In mid-1989, the Minister of Health Helen Clark announced that the polytechnics pharmacy training classes would be moved to the University of Otago, and that occupational-therapy training would move to Auckland. She was met with protesters while attending a polytechnic teachers' conference in Trentham in May. On 31 October 1989, as a result of the Department of Education's Wellington Regional Polytechnic review, the school of health sciences would be relocated to Wellington Polytechnic, closer to the hospital and the School of Nursing.  Premise upgrades  After a failed proposal to start a casino school in 1992, the podiatry school was opened in 1992 by Associate Minister of Health at the time, Katherine O'Regan. An aerobics facility was opened to the public the same year, following the entrance of YMCA into receivership and the closure of five of their gymnasiums. An upgrade to the podiatry school was announced in 1993, including top of the line resources; a surgical unit with two suites, examination rooms, X-ray facilities, recovery rooms and sterilisation facilities. The facility was built on top of the former orthotics and prosthetics site. The same year a lecture theatre was built containing full media facilities. This was located between the northern and western wings of the main group of buildings. In 1994 the site was hosting courses for the Victoria University of Wellington, including the first stage of a Bachelor of Commerce and Administration.  Rise of students  CEO Mike Cooper announced in an interview with Upper Hutt newspaper \\"The Upper Hutt Leader\\" in 1995 the increase in students at the polytechnic. Since 1990, the average student age had risen from 19 to 31; females were now a majority, and Māori students had increased from 5 per cent to 14. The polytechnics roll had increased 26 per cent, while funding per student was down 23 per cent.  Introduction of a Wellington campus  The polytechnic announced on 30 August 1995 that they had leased 158 The Terrace to serve as their Wellington campus. The \\"CIT House\\" was on 26 October 1995 and ran the polytechnics computer science and business courses. It was later reported that these computer courses were being used over the Internet for staff training and personal development by NASA's Jet Propulsion laboratory and Portsmouth Naval Base in Virginia. In 1996, bachelor's degrees in business information, tertiary teaching, tourism and services management were introduced.  Proposed mergers with other polytechnics  A merger between the Auckland Institute of Technology and Auckland College of Education was proposed on 27 November 1996. The merger would unify the courses and structure across the three polytechnics. CEO Mike Cooper however unexpectedly announced his resignation, leaving Trevor Boyle as acting CEO until the outcome of the merger was known. The merger was later abandoned in late 1998. Another proposed merger was in talks with Waikato Polytechnic and was scheduled to be complete by 1 May 1998. A 'measure of agreement' was reached and on 1 July 1998 an article appeared stating the benefits of the merger. The polytechnic offered 11 degree courses at this time, and had campuses across the country, including Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington along with the main campus in Heretaunga, Upper Hutt. CIT later withdrew from this merger as a conclusion could not be met. The Church St campus, which closed in 2017, as seen in 2008.  Merge of Hutt Valley Polytechnic and the Central Institute of Technology (2000–2010)  In 2000, a merger between Hutt Valley Polytechnic and the Central Institute of Technology was announced. The merger would see courses from both occurring at the Petone campus as most students lived closer to this campus. The agreed name of the merged polytechnic was the Wellington Institute of Technology. The Hutt Valley Polytechnic announced the closure of the Heretaunga campus on 18 April 2001. The reasoning for this was due to the decline in students at the Heretaunga campus. Courses ceased at the end of the first trimester in June 2001. Other tertiary providers did take up some of the CIT's courses; including the Auckland Institute of Technology taking up podiatry, and the University of Otago taking up dentistry. The Heretaunga campus was considered by a range of tenants, however was eventually sold to an investment group, who leased the building out to Aurora44, developers of video game Ashen. In 2005, WelTec opened their Church St campus in a previous PricewaterhouseCoopers building, built in 1988.  Attempted merger with Whitireia Community Polytechnic (2011–2019)  On 23 November 2011, the merger of both WelTec and Whitireia Community Polytechnic was approved by the Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce. Each polytechnic would retain its individual branding and identity however operate under a shared council. The new council commenced on 1 January 2012. Discussion regarding a merger of the branding and identity of the two polytechnics followed for years after the merger of the council. Added financial pressure to both polytechnics helped fuel this discussion. In 2018, the Minister for Education Chris Hipkins announced a NZD$65 million cash injection for struggling polytechnics including WelTec and Whitireia. As part of this cash injection, a commissioner was issued to replace the combined council. In 2019, both WelTec and Whitireia announced 55 full-time equivalent jobs would be cut by the end of the year.  Merge into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology (2020–present)  On 1 April 2020, WelTec was subsumed into the New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology (NZIST) alongside 15 other national Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs). The polytechnics will be considered subsidiaries of NZIST until the end of December 2022. The same day as the subsumption, Mark Oldershaw replaced Chris Gosling as CEO of both WelTec and Whitireia.

He belonged to an Alsatian family which had settled in Hungary during the eighteenth century. From 1824 to 1836 he lived in Vienna, studying first in the gymnasium and afterward at the university, and receiving in 1834 the degree of doctor of philosophy. He was then chiefly interested in Oriental languages, and, through the influence of Professor Wenrich, was engaged as teacher of Hebrew in the Protestant seminary. He was introduced at the same time to the Orientalist, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, who employed him as one of his secretaries. Baron von Hammer-Purgstall was instrumental in forming Cohn's decision to leave Vienna, where at that time there was no hope of preferment for a Jew, and to settle in Paris, which he did in 1836. Then began his lifelong connection with the Rothschild family. Three of the children of Baron James de Rothschild received successively from him their instruction in Hebrew and in Jewish history; and in 1839, after a year spent with his pupils in Palestine and in Austria, he was placed by the baron and baroness in charge of their extensive charities, a position which he held for the remainder of his life. Cohn worked for the charity commission of the Paris community, of which he was successively treasurer and president, making it a model for similar institutions throughout Europe. His next field of activity was among the Jews of Algeria, under their French conquerors. In 1845, and again in 1847, he visited the country, often traveling through districts where war was raging, and where the life of a European was insecure. His reports, presented by him personally to King Louis Philippe and to his son, the duc d'Aumale, led to an organization of the Jewish communities of Algeria which was destined to bring about their gradual assimilation with the Jewish communities of France. Cohn was again in Algeria in 1860, after visiting Morocco, where matters pertaining to the Jews, which required his attention, arose from the Spanish expedition of that year. Owing to his influence with the celebrated Don Juan Prim and others, these matters were solved in a manner that was favorable to the Jewish population. His activity in the East was equally important. He visited Jerusalem no less than five times between 1854 and 1869. His first voyage was undertaken at the request of the Consistoire Central des Israélites de France, which had been requested by Jews in every part of Europe to investigate the condition of their coreligionists of the Ottoman empire, and to secure, through the influence of the European great powers, some alleviation of their condition. His first visit to Jerusalem (1854) was the first visible sign to the Jews of the Holy Land that an interest in their condition was being taken by their brothers of France, Italy, England, and Germany. Sums of money had already been sent by Sir Moses Montefiore; but Cohn was the first to see how matters really stood, and to apply the needed remedies. He was helped in the performance of his task by his linguistic gifts and knowledge of the idioms of the East. On this preliminary trip to the East, in the course of which he first passed through Vienna, he delivered addresses in German, Italian, Hebrew, and Arabic. The result of Cohn's observations in Alexandria, Smyrna, Jaffa, and Jerusalem was the establishment in those places of Jewish hospitals and schools, as well as institutions for the assistance of young mothers, these organizations being supported mostly by the Rothschild family, but also by other benefactors. But Cohn's chief service was performed at Constantinople on his return journey from Jerusalem. He was received in private audience by Sultan 'Abd al-Majid, from whom he asked and received a promise that no improvements should be introduced in the legal conditions of the Christian subjects of Turkey which would not also apply to the Jews. For years he delivered lectures on Jewish history before popular audiences; and he taught without remuneration in the Séminaire Israélite from the time of its transfer from Metz to Paris until a few months before his death. His large collection of philological works and rabbinical literature now forms a part of the library of that institution. He had seat in the Consistoire Central des Israélites de France; and the French government bestowed upon him the Cross of the Legion of Honor. He also received the Grande Medaille of the Société Française pour l'Encouragement au Bien.

Dickmanns along with its twin vehicle, the VITA-2. They were able to drive in heavy traffic for long distances without human intervention, using computer vision to recognize rapidly moving obstacles such as other cars, and automatically avoid and pass them. The experimental driverless car VaMP (Versuchsfahrzeug für autonome Mobilität und Rechnersehen) which was developed in the context of the European research project PROMETHEUS: (top left) components for autonomous driving; (right) VaMP and view into passenger cabin (lower right); (lower left) bifocal camera arrangement (front) on yaw platform The VaMP was constructed by the team of Ernst Dickmanns at the Bundeswehr University of Munich and Mercedes-Benz in the 1990s as part of the 800 million ECU EUREKA Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles (1987–1995). It was a 500 SEL Mercedes re-engineered such that it was possible to control steering wheel, throttle, and brakes through computer commands based on real-time evaluation of image sequences. Software was written that translated sensory data into appropriate driving commands. Due to the limited computing power of the time period, sophisticated computer vision strategies were necessary to react in real time. The Dickmanns team solved the problem through an innovative approach to dynamic computer vision. Attention control including artificial saccadic movements of the platform carrying the cameras allowed the system to focus its attention on the most relevant details of the visual input. Four cameras with two different focal lengths for each hemisphere were used in parallel for this purpose. Kalman filters were extended to handle perspective imaging and to achieve robust autonomous driving even in the presence of noise and uncertainty. Sixty transputers, a type of parallel computers, were used to deal with the enormous (by 1990s standards) computational demands. In 1994, the VaMP and its twin VITA-2 were stars of the final international presentation of the PROMETHEUS project in October 1994 on Autoroute 1 near the Charles-de-Gaulle airport in Paris. With a safety driver and guests on board, the twins drove more than 1000 km in normal traffic on the three-lane highway at speeds up to 130 km/h. They demonstrated lane changes left and right, autonomously passing other cars after maneuver approval by the safety driver. One year later, the autonomous Mercedes-Benz drove more than from Munich to Copenhagen and back in traffic at up to 180 km/h, again planning and executing maneuvers to pass other cars with safety driver approval. However, only in a few critical situations (such as unmodeled construction areas) a safety driver took over completely. Again, active computer vision was used to deal with rapidly changing street scenes. The car achieved speeds exceeding 175 km/h on the German Autobahn, with a mean distance between human interventions of 9 km. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 158 km without any human intervention. Most current robot cars as well as commercial vehicles with driver assistance use GPS so that they know precisely where they are. However, the VaMP did not use GPS, and relied on vision only. The VaMP and VITA-2 projects pioneered many hardware and software concepts that are essential for autonomous robots. They left a big impression on many observers and heavily influenced robot car research and funding decisions worldwide. Since May 2006, VaMP is on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany.

He amassed a significant private collection of books and rare manuscripts which formed the basis for the Strashun Library of Vilnius, which operated from 1892 to 1941. Early life and education Mattityahu Strashun was born to Samuel Strashun (1794–1872), a prominent Talmudist and merchant, and his wife Sara Strashun, in Vilnius, Vilna Governorate. Coming from a well-to-do family, Mattityahu, at the age of 13, married the eldest daughter of the wealthy Joseph Elijah Eliasberg. His father-in-law bought him a business dealing in silks, which his wife managed so he could dedicate himself to Torah study. Strashun was financially independent throughout his life. Strashun studied under Rabbi Menashe of Ilya, a disciple of the Vilna Gaon, and Rabbi Yitzhak of Volozhin (son of Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin). In addition to mastering Talmud, Strashun acquired fluency in Hebrew and had a working knowledge of Russian, Polish, German, French, and Latin. He also studied mathematics, philosophy, history, and astronomy. Activities Strashun was a diligent Torah scholar who was said to immerse himself in study 10 to 15 hours a day. His home was a gathering place for educated community members and visitors from abroad. During his 1857 trip around Europe to collect rare manuscripts, the Berlin Jewish community asked him to serve as their Rav, but he declined. He published more than 300 articles of Midrashic commentary in various journals, including Pirchei Tzafon, Kerem Hemed, Hamagid, and HaLevanon. He generally wrote under a nom de plume, such as Ani Ve-Hu and Ve-Hu Ve-Hu. His textual scholarship on the Midrash was published in his sefer Mattat Yah (1892); other annotations were included in the German translation of the Midrash Rabbah by August Wünsche. His historical study of Vilnius, titled Rehovot Kiryah (Streets of the City), was published as an addendum to Samuel Joseph Fuenn's Kiryah Ne'emanah (Faithful City) (1860). In a letter he wrote in 1832 Strashun expressed support for the Haskalah, the Jewish enlightenment movement. In 1841 he joined the faculty of a Haskalah-inspired school in Vilnius. Strashun was also active in communal affairs. He served as president of the Central Charity in Vilnius and was the gabbai (secretary) of the Torah Study Society, the Burial Society, and the fund for charity for the poor in Israel. He maintained good connections with the government and was appointed to the city council of Vilnius and to the board of the Vilnius branch of the Russian Imperial Bank. In 1878, he received a gold medal from the government for the latter service. The government also made him an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Culture among the Jews of Russia. Strashun used his government connections and his wealth to organize the exemption of 58 Vilnius Jews from forced conscription. Library In 1857 Strashun traveled to countries outside Russia to amass a private collection of Hebrew books and rare manuscripts. Strashun's collection included \\"religious writings, fiction, poetry, scientific works, Jewish and Karaite historical works, travel accounts, and Hasidic texts\\". The collection encompassed works published in Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany, Holland, Bohemia, and Poland from the 1400s through the 1800s. Listed at 5,700 pieces, the library was catalogued in the 1889 publication Likutei Shoshanim (A Bunch of Roses). Strashun bequeathed the collection to the Vilnius community upon his death. His collection formed the basis for the Strashun Library of Vilnius, which opened in Strashun's home in 1892 and moved to its own building in 1901. With donations of books by other scholars and contributions from the Vilnius University Library, the collection expanded to 33,000 titles by 1931. During World War II, the Strashun Library was looted and partially destroyed by the Nazis; in 1945 about 40,000 volumes were retrieved by the U.S. Army in Germany. The YIVO Institute was one of the beneficiaries of the collection. In June 2017 the Strashun Library was entered into the UNESCO Memory of the World Registry in a ceremony held by the Directorate of the State Cultural Reserve of Kernavė, which retains 1,300 prints.

It was created in 1627 and disappeared in 1634, after death of the ruler, Albrecht von Wallenstein (1582 - 1634). It was preceded by the Principality of Friedland (Czech: Frýdlantské knížectví, German: Fürstentum Friedland) existing in the years 1624 to 1627. Establishment of the principality, and then the duchy, followed the rise to power of Albrecht von Wallenstein, a military leader in the service of the House of Habsburg during the Thirty Years' War. In August 1622 Wallenstein was granted titles of Count Palatine (falckrabě, Pfalzgraf) and Imperial Count (hrabě, Graf). A predicate \\"of Friedland\\" (z Frýdlantu, von Friedland) was granted after northern Bohemian town Frýdlant (Friedland) acquired by Wallenstein in 1621, together with the whole Friedland dominion (panství, Herschaft). On September 7, 1623 he was given title of Imperial Duke. At this time he owned 49 dominions in eastern and northern part of Bohemia, in year 1624 the number grew up to 64 and on March 12, 1624 Emperor Ferdinand II declared the area as Principality of Friedland. Because of ducal title the Principality was elevated to Duchy on January 4, 1627. The new duchy was de facto independent from the rest of Bohemia. Wallenstein had started an ambitious reconstruction of Jičín, capital of the duchy. He planned to set up bishopric, university and a diet. In 1628 he obtained the right to mint its own coins and the rights to grant nobility titles and township privileges. Preparation for the new university included invitation of Jesuits to Jičín where they established a Jesuit college. Wallenstein initiated building of a large early-Baroque church as a seat of the bishop (the building was never finished though but serves until today as the main church in the town). Next to the church the ducal palace was built. Area of the town had doubled during this period. Near to Jičín a large park was established - remains of whose survived until now. Throughout the duchy Wallenstein's financier Hans de Witte set up and controlled silver, copper and lead mines, iron forges, armament factories and river Labe transportation system, all geared up to supply warlord's forces. After Wallenstein's death (1634) most of the duchy was given to Count Matthias Gallas and its independent status was annulled.

She was awarded the title People's Artist of Russia. (1996) Biography Margarita Terekhova was born on August 25, 1942 in the town of Turinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast. In school, Margarita was interested in sport and was a basketball captain. She finished school with a gold medal. From 1959 she studied at the physics and mathematics faculty at the Tashkent State University from 1959 until 1961. After that she went to Moscow and tried to get into VGIK but her application was declined. After that she enrolled to study at the school- studio of Yuri Zavadsky at the Mossovet Theatre. After her graduation in 1964 she worked for many years as an actress of the Mossovet Theatre. From 1983 to 1987 she acted in the theatre group \\"The Puppet Show\\" organized by her and Igor Talkov. Terekhova's acting debut was in 1965 in the film Hello, That's Me!. Margarita became particularly popular in the late 1970s, after the release of a costumed musical TV films The Dog in the Manger and D'Artagnan and Three Musketeers. At first she played the capricious Countess Diana de Belflor, in the second - the treacherous Milady. Leading roles followed in films made by directors including Andrei Smirnov and Ilya Averbakh (Monologue, 1972) as well as the dual-role in Andrei Tarkovsky's acclaimed Mirror (1975). And more international co-productions came after, including George Cukor's The Blue Bird (1976) and Konrad Wolf's Mama, I'm Alive (1977). Terekhova's subsequent work in film proved her high level of acting expertise but did not reach such great success as her earlier work. Margarita Terekhova worked and was friends with Igor Talkov. They had a close relationship and worked for some time together at the musical theatre collective \\"Balaganchik\\". In 2005 she made her debut as a director, shooting the film \\"The Seagull\\" based on the work of Anton Chekhov. Starting from 2005 Margarita no longer plays in a theater, not in films and almost never gives interviews due to Alzheimer's disease.

She was named for Greer County, Oklahoma on 1 July 1955, and the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-799 by the Jeffersonville Boat & Machine Company of Jeffersonville, Indiana on 25 August 1944; launched on 3 October, sponsored by Miss Mary R. Whalen; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana on 21 October 1944, with Lieutenant Daniel C. Millet in command.  World War II  Following shakedown off Florida, LST-799 loaded construction equipment at Gulfport, Mississippi, and steamed on 29 November for the West Coast. Loading ammunition cargo at San Francisco, California, she departed on 13 February 1945, and arrived at Saipan on 24 March. Two days later she was en route to Okinawa, where the largest amphibious operation of the Pacific war was about to begin. Under the threat of enemy air raids, LST-799 approached the beaches of Okinawa on 2 April, one day after the initial landings. On 3 April LST-599 was hit by a kamikaze and a fire-rescue party from LST-799 assisted in extinguishing the blaze caused by the impact. The landing ship was on General Quarters consistently during the next month as the enemy made a futile effort to stop the accelerating American drive across the Pacific toward Japan. Departing Okinawa on 8 May, LST-799 sailed to Ulithi and for the rest of the war shuttled cargo among the American-held bases. Following the end of World War II, she supported occupation forces in Japan and the Philippines until 22 April 1946 when she decommissioned at Japan.  Korean War  Following the outbreak of war in Korea in the summer of 1950, LST-799 recommissioned at Yokosuka, Japan on 26 August 1950. On 5 September she departed with a cargo of ammunition and provisions, arriving at Pusan, Korea two days later. There she loaded a tank unit of the U.S. 5th Marines and sailed for the landings at Inchon, which turned the tide of the conflict. General MacArthur summed up the success of the 15 September assault: \\"The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\\" After the Inchon landings, LST-799 sailed for Wonsan, arriving there on 25 October. USS Greer County (LST-799) on the pier at Inchon, South Korea in 1950, the result of miscalculating the extreme ebb and flow of the tides in that port. During December an overhaul was interrupted to participate in the evacuation of American and South Korean troops at Hungnam. On 24 December she embarked final covering elements of the U.S. 3rd Division, and sailed for Pusan arriving the 27th. In early 1951, she completed overhaul and was equipped with helicopter landing facilities. Assigned as a mine squadron flagship, she performed logistic support for minesweepers off the Korean east coast. She remained off Korea until September 1952; and, in addition to logistics, performed helicopter rescue operations, engaged in the coastal blockade, and participated in the Wonsan Harbor Control System. Following extended overhaul at Long Beach, California, LST-799 returned to the Western Pacific on 9 April 1953. She resumed duties out of Wonsan as a Mine Squadron flagship. After the armistice, she continued evacuation and training in the Far East, until sailing for the United States late in November 1953. From 1954 to 1956, LST-799 made two cruises to the Western Pacific. On 1 July 1955, she was named USS Greer County (LST-799). Upon return from her 1956 cruise, she became flagship of Mine Squadron 7 operating along the West Coast. Post-War Greer County was decommissioned on 18 January 1960, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1960, and subsequently sold for scrapping. LST-799 earned one battle star for World War II service and the Navy Unit Commendation, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and nine battle stars for the Korean War.

The alpha-adrenergic receptor has two subclasses α1 and α2. Alpha 2 receptors are associated with sympatholytic properties. Alpha-adrenergic agonists have the opposite function of alpha blockers. Alpha adrenoreceptor ligands mimic the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine signaling in the heart, smooth muscle and central nervous system, with norepinephrine being the highest affinity. The activation of α1 stimulates the membrane bound enzyme phospholipase C, and activation of α2 inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase. Inactivation of adenylate cyclase in turn leads to the inactivation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate and induces smooth muscle and blood vessel constriction. Classes Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) Although complete selectivity between receptor agonism is rarely achieved, some agents have partial selectivity. NB: the inclusion of a drug in each category just indicates the activity of the drug at that receptor, not necessarily the selectivity of the drug (unless otherwise noted). α1 agonist α1 agonist: stimulates phospholipase C activity.

Warham was born in Warrington, Lancashire, England. Following a playing career as a winger with Oldham and Swinton, and a spell coaching Rochdale Hornets, Joe went to Headingley as coach in 1958. Under his stewardship, and assisted by Dai Prosser, in 1960/61 Leeds won their first-ever championship, beating Warrington 25-10 in the final at Odsal Stadium. Joe later moved to head up Leeds' scouting and recruiting efforts, signing many of the players who formed the backbone of Leeds' very successful late 1960s, and 1970s side. As Roy Francis, coach in the mid-sixties, said later, with players that talented he had no need to coach or drill them - he sent them on to the pitch to play their natural game. In 1969 Joe stepped up to coach Leeds again on an interim basis following Roy Francis' departure, and once again brought success, the club winning the championship for a second time. In the seventies Joe served the club in a number of capacities, including scouting, organising players' testimonials and representing the club on various RL committees, before being made General Manager of the Company in 1980. His period of tenure saw a number of significant ground improvements at Headingley - including, on the Test cricket ground, the UK's first electronic cricket scoreboard. After leaving the board he served as president of Leeds' Taverners' Club and as President of Leeds' ex-players' association.

The story revolves around a humanoid genetically modified dog named after Gene Hackman, in the distant future. Earth has been overrun by giant insects, known simply as \\"Them.\\" Most of the human race has been wiped out, and the few thousand survivors are waiting in suspended animation until the world is habitable again. The world is patrolled by dog soldiers called \\"auxes,\\" such as Gene, who fight Them on humanity's behalf. Plot First series At the beginning of the series, Gene the Hackman is the leader of his pack, patrolling Antarctica (which they call \\"Anarchticy\\", the name having been corrupted over the centuries). They follow the orders of voices in their heads known as the urgings, which are transmitted to them by their \\"Masters\\" (who are never seen in the series). On the coast, Gene and his pack encounter a mysterious \\"land bridge\\" which leads into the sea and beyond the horizon. They conclude that \\"Them\\" from another continent created the bridge to invade Antarctica. The urgings stop, something which has never happened before, and so the pack debate whether to return home to report their discovery or continue their patrol (which has already lasted for an unprecedented length of time). Some of the pack desert Gene, and those who remain with him are all killed in action. Gene alone survives, with crippling injuries, and finds refuge in a mysterious building. The building turns out to be an ancient outpost, built nearly two thousand years ago by humans. It is run automatically by an advanced computer, and contains a human operative in suspended animation, who is awoken by the computer on Gene's arrival. Gene has never seen a human before – it is revealed that what he thinks are the Masters are not actually humans but merely robots which run everything while the humans sleep – so he is initially sceptical that this human, who he regards as weak and sickly, could be a Master. But when Gene's injuries are rapidly healed with advanced medical technology he hasn't seen before, he accepts the possibility that there might be more to the human than meets the eye. The outpost is attacked by overwhelming numbers of Them, and despite the advanced weaponry available there, Gene is only saved by the timely arrival of another pack. The human does not survive, and the new pack does not believe Gene's story. The story ends as Gene heads alone out of Antarctica over the land bridge. Second series: \\"The Promised Land\\" Gene has arrived in Tasmania, and finds it to be overrun with new species of Them he hasn't seen before. They are larger than the ones he was used to fighting at home. But many of them have been incapacitated by parasites, \\"ticks\\", gruesome bulbous creatures covered with teeth which attach themselves to the giant insects' bodies. Gene himself is attacked by dozens of these ticks in a swamp, and only just manages to fight them off. Shortly after recovering from this attack, Gene begins to hear the urgings again, for the first time since discovering the land bridge. The urgings lead Gene to discover a small farm run by a community of humans. The farm is surrounded by a fence to keep Them out, but Gene manages to get inside. Once in the farm, Gene befriends a young girl, called Leezee Sower, who introduces him to her father. The adults accept Gene, recognising that his combat abilities will be useful in defending the farm against Them, who have recently been attacking with greater frequency and ferocity than before. Gene enjoys living on the farm, but becomes suspicious about the fact that he is being fed meat, given that there are no animals on the farm. He is told that the meat is being grown artificially in a large warehouse, but it is out of bounds and he is strictly forbidden to enter it. Defying the rules of the farmers and the admonitions of the urgings, Gene investigates anyway. He is horrified to discover that the warehouse is infested with ticks. The farmers arrive and arrest him for uncovering their secret, and Gene learns that each of the farmers is infected with a tick, even Leezee Sower. Gene insists that the ticks must be destroyed, as their presence on the farm is evidently the reason why Them are attacking it. But the humans refuse. They regard the ticks as normal, even desirable, and they are unconcerned about being infected. Leezee points out to Gene that he is also infected, and Gene realises that he has had a tick attached to him since the attack in the swamp. The voices he has heard in his head since then are not really the urgings of the Masters, but the telepathic thoughts of the tick as it tries to control him. Gene kills his tick, but the experience is so agonisingly painful that he almost does not survive. That night, Them attack and overwhelm the farm, killing everyone. Gene manages to rescue Leezee and they escape into the wilderness, the only survivors. Leezee begs Gene to let her return to the farm, but Gene recognises that this isn't really her own desire but her tick's, as it controls her. He leads her farther away from the farm. Gene tries to kill Leezee's tick, but the tick tells him that Leezee would not survive the separation. Gene reluctantly abandons the attempt for the time being, intending to search for someone intelligent enough to figure out how to detach or kill the tick without also killing its host. Third series: \\"Call of the Wild\\" Gene and Leezee reach Sydney, which is in ruins. They discover a new pack of auxes, but these ones are not pure-breeds like Gene. They have been breeding wild for centuries, and so the gene pool has diversified. Most of the pack welcome Gene, and one female pack member in particular, called Clara Bow, is especially fond of him. But there is one male, called Dingo Star, who resents Gene as he sees him as a rival to his own status within the pack. The pack turns out to be just one of many packs, which all belong to a kingdom run by an aux of greater than normal intelligence, called Rex Horizon. Rex has a pet human, who he keeps in a cage, and it transpires that the auxes all think that Leezee is Gene's pet, since they had no prior knowledge of humans. Rex's pet, Paul Numan, tells Gene that three years ago he was in suspended animation on a space station in orbit around the earth. He was awoken and sent down to Sydney to investigate some unexplained electrical activity, which turned out to be the result of Rex having discovered how to make the old machines work again. He offers to take Leezee to safety up on the station, if Gene will rescue him. But Gene is now loyal to the Wild Kingdom he has just joined, instead of to his old Masters, and he refuses to help. The Wild Kingdom suddenly finds that it is being attacked by Them more frequently than ever before, and by Them of increasing size. Numan realises it is because they can detect the scent of Leezee's tick parasite, which is deadly to Them, and they want to destroy it. Rex orders Dingo to abduct Leezee and chain her up outside where Them will find her, so that Them will leave the Kingdom alone. Rex tells Gene that his pet ran away, but Gene knows this is a lie, since he alone understands that Leezee is not his pet. Gene releases Numan from his cage, and enlists him to help find Leezee and take her to the orbiting station. Dingo interrupts the rescue, and a brutal fight ensues, in which Gene kills Dingo. Gene's pack hunts him down as a wanted murderer. Gene and Numan find Leezee and save her from Them in the nick of time. Numan summons a ship to collect him and Leezee and take them to the orbiting station. But they are forced to leave Gene behind when he is captured by his pack. Gene only survives because of the intervention of Clara Bow, and the pack allow him to escape, realising that by removing the tick from the Wild Kingdom he may have saved them all from destruction. Gene sets out across Australia on his own. Fourth series: \\"His Master's Voice\\" Clara Bow catches up with Gene and tells him that she would rather stay with him than live in the Wild Kingdom. Together they discover a base run by robots, where an elderly and insane human general has awoken from suspended animation. A series of flashbacks throughout the story show the general as a young captain in New Mexico, six years before the last human survivors entered suspended animation. He was the leader of the project which created the first dog soldiers, the ancestors of Gene Hackman. The general detains them, intending to harvest Gene's body for DNA with which to make a new army of thousands of auxes like him (a process which will be fatal to Gene). Clara Bow is held as a hostage, along with some other aux captives whose DNA is not pure enough for the general's purposes. Gene resists at first, but surrenders when the general threatens to kill the hostages if he does not submit. Luring the mad general into a false sense of security, Gene kills him, and the robots deactivate. Gene, Clara Bow and the other hostages leave the base together. Fifth series: \\"Aux Drift\\" Gene and his new pack discover Aux Drift, a mining outpost where humans and auxes work together. These humans are not \\"Masters,\\" and they explain that that term only refers to the elite humans who could afford to enter suspended animation when the world was overrun by Them. The humans who could not afford to hide in suspended animation were simply abandoned to fend for themselves. Aux Drift is attacked by a swarm of Them which display more intelligence than usual. Gene discovers that they are being controlled by a giant Them, one bigger than any that has ever been seen before. The miners teach him how to use explosives, and he kills the giant insect by blowing it up. Aux Drift is abandoned, and the miners take Gene's pack back home to their city, which they call the Kingdom. Sixth series: \\"Beast of Eden\\" By the start of this story, Gene and Clara Bow have produced two sons, and Gene is recognised as the toughest soldier in the Kingdom. The Kingdom is attacked by a larger army of Them than anyone has seen before. This super-swarm is controlled by another king Them, like the one at Aux Drift, and so Gene leads a mission to kill it. He leaves Clara behind to protect their sons. During Gene's mission, his pack encounters Numan, who has returned to Earth to investigate whether the Masters' new plan to defeat Them is working. After the king has been killed, Numan reveals that the Masters took the tick parasite from Leezee Sower and used it to create a biological weapon to infect and destroy Them. Numan discovers that Them perceive the ticks as a greater threat than the humans or the auxes, but realises that Them are evolving rapidly to counter the ticks, which is the reason that intelligent Them kings now exist. Gene is furious and he attacks Numan, but Numan's bodyguard, an aux called Major Canis, stops him. Numan takes Gene (and the only two surviving members of his pack) back to the Masters' space station in orbit. Seventh series: \\"As it is in Heaven\\" It is six months after Gene arrived on the station. The Kingdom has been destroyed by Them. Gene and his friends have been put into suspended animation to keep him out of the way, because the Masters consider them a liability. The Masters decide that this is no longer a good use of their resources, so they decide to euthanise Gene and his pack in their sleep. Leezee Sower, now an adult, decides to save Gene instead. She wakes him and they flee, killing two aux in the process. In a bid to force Gene to surrender, Major Canis wakes Gene's two friends from suspended animation and takes them hostage, threatening to kill them if Gene does not submit. Gene attempts a rescue, but he fails and both his friends are killed. Gene turns against the Masters and vows never to obey or help them again, apart from Sower. Gene and Sower escape into an abandoned part of the space station, where they encounter Pause, a renegade aux who has turned against the Masters. Pause is able to hack into the station's computer systems without the Masters knowing. He recruits Gene and Sower to help him steal the codes which control the Masters' new weapon, the ticks. The Masters' plan is to use the ticks to destroy Them, and then activate a faulty gene they have bred into the ticks which will kill them all, leaving Earth fit for human habitation again. Gene steals the codes, but while hiding from Major Canis he discovers the laboratory where the ticks are being bred. There he discovers the real Leezee Sower, who has become a hideously deformed hybrid, part human, part giant tick. The original Sower explains that the other Leezee Sower who Gene has been with on the station is a clone. The scientists had been unable to remove the tick from Sower, so instead they had kept her in the lab, and created the clone through which she could live a normal life, since the original can see what the clone sees and can control her. Major Canis and Numan discover Gene in the lab, and demand that he hand over the codes. The giant tick, controlling Sower's voice, demands the codes so that its species won't be destroyed. Not willing to help either side, Gene instead attacks everybody. He kills the original Leezee Sower and wounds Numan and Canis. He escapes from the station with the Sower clone, Pause and the codes, to return to the Kingdom and his family – not knowing that the Kingdom has been destroyed. Eighth series: \\"Alpha and Omega\\" Gene's shuttle crash lands in Patagonia, pursued by a squad of auxes led by Canis and Numan. They encounter an unprecedented phenomenon: auxes and humans riding Them as steeds. This new force captures Gene, but Pause and Leezee Sower escape. Gene learns that the Them-riders are infected with ticks; not the weaponised ones genetically engineered by the masters but natural ticks which evolved at an accelerated rate. The influence of these ticks enables the humans and auxes to work together as equals, and they refer to themselves as \\"Us.\\" Us invite Gene to join them, but he does not trust the ticks, and so he refuses. Canis's squad attacks Us, but is repulsed and Numan is captured. Numan is forcibly infected with a tick, making him one of Us. He tells Us about the codes Gene stole from the masters, and they search Gene but fail to find the codes. They threaten Gene, but are suddenly attacked again by Canis. Meanwhile, Pause has requested a nuclear strike by imitating Canis's voice in a radio message to the orbiting satellite. During the chaos caused by the blast, Gene escapes from Us, and Canis is killed by Pause and Leezee. Gene discloses that he gave the codes to Leezee, who has had them ever since they landed. The masters in the space station believe Gene and the codes to have been destroyed in the nuclear explosion, and so they begin working to recreate the codes from scratch, a process that will take years. Meanwhile Us, now led by Numan, are ambushed by a new humanoid form of Them, which have also evolved at a highly accelerated rate in an arms race with the ticks. This new form of Them tells Numan, in English, that his species is finished, and then kills him.

(Wellington: Grantham House, 1998) but it is by definition a branch line incorporating an incline. and known as the Point Elizabeth Branch in its early years, was a branch line railway located in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. It branched from the Midland Line near its western terminus in Greymouth and ran up to Rewanui in the Paparoa Ranges. The branch closed in 1985 but the first six kilometres to Runanga remain in operation as part of the Rapahoe Branch. Construction In 1889, the Cobden Railway and Mining Company and Point Elizabeth Coal Company in conjunction began construction of the line, with the original terminus situated in Dunollie. However, a decade later, the joint venture collapsed, and in 1901, the State Mines Department took over the railway operations in conjunction with the mining activity. Operation of the line subsequently passed to the New Zealand Railways Department on 1 December 1904.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 59. In comparison to the extension to Rewanui, this section was sedated, with the only significant engineering work being the Cobden Bridge across the Grey River at the start of the branch. Good coal deposits had been discovered in the Paparoa Ranges, and although the Roa Incline was being built on the other side from a junction with the Stillwater - Westport Line in Ngahere and could carry coal mined from some of the coal seams,David Leitch, Steam, Steel and Splendour (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1994), 116. a branch up the valley of the Seven Mile Creek was seen as necessary. This line was to be extremely steep: over its 5.4 kilometre length between Dunollie and the terminus, it would rise 163 metres with grades as severe as 1 in 26.Leitch, Steam, Steel and Splendour, 112. This necessitated the installation of a Fell centre rail to assist braking on the descent, though this was not full use of the Fell system like the Rimutaka Incline in the North Island was. The line was opened to its Rewanui terminus on 21 January 1914, with a full length of 13.07 kilometres. Operation  Passenger services  Rewanui was inaccessible by road, thus a considerable number of passenger trains operated by the standards of New Zealand branch lines. Although primarily for miners, the trains became minor local tourist attractions in the later years of the line due to the scenic nature of the route. During holiday periods at the mine, special tourist trains were operated, while during regular operations, tourists typically caught the early afternoon service. A number of the regular services acquired nicknames: * 6:35am Greymouth to Rewanui: \\"Miner's Train\\". * 7:35am Rewanui to Greymouth: \\"Fanny Train\\", as it was primarily used by the wives of miners in Rewanui and Dunollie to travel to their own jobs in Greymouth. * Early afternoon service to Greymouth: The \\"wet-timer\\", as miners working in wet parts of the mine had shorter shifts and used this train. * Sunday to Thursday mixed train that reached Rewanui at 11:30pm: the \\"Paddy Webb\\" or \\"Bob Semple\\", after the miners who became New Zealand Labour Party government ministers and first organised the service to benefit those miners whose shift began or ended at midnight. In addition, a bicycle track was located alongside the line for miners working shifts without convenient train service. Freight services Freight traffic was almost exclusively coal. It came from the state-owned Liverpool Mine, for which the line was expressly built, as well as from a number of nearby privately owned mines. Motive power Motive power had to be specially modified to work on the Rewanui Branch past Dunollie. In the steam era, motive power came primarily from the three members of the WE class. In 1902, two members of the B class of tender locomotives were converted into WE class tank locomotives for work on the Rimutaka Incline. One, WE 377, was transferred south at the time of the Incline's opening, followed by WE 376 in 1927. The third WE, 375, was not converted from the B class until 1943. W and WA class locomotives sometimes hauled light trains on the Incline, and in the 1960s, three members of the WW class were modified to work to Rewanui. After extra brakes were fitted to the three WWs and WE 375, the Fell centre rail was removed in 1966 and only those four engines were permitted to run to Rewanui.Leitch, Steam, Steel and Splendour, 112-3 In June 1969, diesel locomotives fitted with modified brakes took over from the steam locomotives. These were primarily of the DJ class, but DSC class shunters operated some services. These locomotives worked the line through to its closure. One quirk of the line's motive power was a Land Rover converted to run on rails. It was based in Rewanui from May 1960 and functioned as an ambulance. Previously, miners who were injured had to travel down the Incline in a specially modified \\"gravity powered\\" wagon.  Fell Vans  Special fell brake vans were used on the Rewanui Incline between Dunollie and Rewanui. Six vans were built with three being allocated for use on the Rewanui incline and the other three on the Roa Incline. They were similar in design to the vans used on the Rimutaka Incline, over the Wairarapa Ranges, but had no duckets, and instead, had windows at either end. The chassis and brake gear, however, remained the same. With the closure of the Rimutaka Incline in 1955, surplus vans were transferred to Greymouth for use on the Rewanui and Roa Inclines. Closure In the early 1980s, the Liverpool Mine was becoming an increasingly uneconomic mine to run. The line thus came to an abrupt end when the decision was taken to close the mine in 1984. That year, in October, the line was ruled unfit for passenger service, and all scheduled services – both passenger and freight – were cancelled on 5 November 1984. Occasional freight services continued to operate until May 1985, when the last train departed Rewanui with a load of coal from a nearby private mine. The line was formally closed on 19 August 1985 from the junction with the Rapahoe Branch, which absorbed the six kilometres to Greymouth and remains in use. Trains run when required to Rapahoe.New Zealand Train Timetable Guide , accessed 21 June 2007, last update of guide on 7 June 2007. The branch today The Runanga-Rewanui line is one of the most accessible closed railway lines in New Zealand, as the former railway route has been converted into a road to Rewanui.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 58. However, due to operations by the Spring Creek Mine, the road is inaccessible to vehicles. It is possible to walk or cycle to Rewanui. A local committee exists to preserve the Rewanui area as a historic site, but a landslide in 1988 killed the caretaker and destroyed bridges and some buildings. Many remnants have been long destroyed but the coal loading bin, some L and Q class wagons, two-foot gauge coal tubs and the engineer's workshop survive. A plaque has been placed on a stone at the summit as a memorial.

He was Head Coach of Saif Sporting Club Ltd during their first season in the Bangladesh Premier League and took them to fourth in the league and to AFC Cup qualifiers. He played in the Football League for Torquay United and Yeovil Town and in the National League for Woking, Weston-s-Mare AFC and Dorchester Town. He was Director of Football and Head Coach of Weston-super-Mare in the National League South and was recognised for his work developing players such as Ollie Watkins (loan from Exeter, now Brentford), Brad Ash (sold to Barnsley), Dayle Grubb (later sold to Forest Green Rovers), Scott Wilson (sold to Eastleigh, now Macclesfield)https://int.soccerway.com/coaches/ryan-northmore/391649/ Playing career Northmore began his career as a trainee with Torquay United, having previously been on the books of Plymouth Argyle and Swindon Town. He turned professional in August 1998, making his first team debut away to Gillingham in the Auto-Windscreens Trophy on 7 December 1999. His league debut came on 5 February 2000 in Torquay's 4–0 win at home to Halifax Town after regular keeper, Neville Southall had been injured in the previous league game. Northmore was highly rated by Southall as his understudy, but, when Southall was released at the end of the season, Stuart Jones was signed and took over as first choice keeper. Northmore replaced Jones early in the season and was a regular for the remainder of the season as Torquay struggled to avoid relegation to the Conference. However, Northmore was dropped for the crucial final game of the season, away to Barnet, a game that saw Jones save a penalty and Torquay survive at Barnet's expense. When Roy McFarland took over as Torquay manager, one of his first signings was Kevin Dearden, whose consistent form kept Ryan on the substitutes bench for most of the season. Leroy Rosenior took over as Torquay manager at the end of the season and Northmore was relegated to third choice keeper after the signing of Jamie Attwell. After his release by the Plainmoor side in October 2002, he became a full-time student at the University of Bath and played for the University side Team Bath in the Western League. He moved to Conference side Woking in June 2003, but was unable to dislodge another former Torquay keeper Ashley Bayes from the goalkeepers position and was allowed to join Bath City on loan in December 2003 and Yeovil Town on loan in March 2004. Northmore returned to Team Bath on a free transfer in the 2004 close season, but joined Weston- super-Mare on loan in September 2004. However, Northmore was recalled by Team Bath in December. Later that month Northmore returned to Weston on loan until the end of the season, when he was signed on a permanent basis by Weston. Northmore signed a new contract with Weston in June 2007. Following his exit from Weston in July 2009, Northmore signed for Dorchester before retiring from playing in 2010. Coaching and managerial career Northmore was made Director of Football at Weston in 2012 after expanding the academy. He was given the Head Coach role in 2014 and remained in charge until September 2016 with the club in mid table on 10 points. He joined Saif Sporting Club in the Bangladesh Premier League in April 2017 as assistant coach, teaming up with Kim Grant - an old friend - who was manager at the club. Grant was sacked midway through the season and Northmore took over leading the club to their first ever appearance in the AFC Cup at the end on the 2017–18. On 25 May 2018 it was confirmed that Northmore had been appointed manager of Southern League Premier Division side Gosport Borough. However, less than a month later, he was forced to quit the club after his Colombian wife was refused entry into the UK and he decided to put his family first. In July 2019, Northmore was appointed under-18 manager of National League club Yeovil Town.

As in Hesse and Rheinland-Pfalz, the Saarland Police is abolishing the “green star” ranks meaning their new police officers start to work the road as Kommissars. This reform aims at making the police profession more attractive and improving promotion chances. Organisation The state police falls under the jurisdiction of the Saarland state interior ministry and has two main police authorities, the Landespolizeidirektion (LPD) which is the state police headquarters and the State Investigation Bureau (Landeskriminalamt or LKA), which are both located in Saarbrücken. The Landespolizeidirektion consists of four departments, the Police Support Group (Bereitschaftspolizei), Services, Traffic Police and Investigations. The Police Support Group consists of the state's rapid reaction company, police dog section, the police band and the river police station in Beckingen that patrols the Saar and Moselle in Saarland. Police stations are located in Merzig-Wadern, St. Wendel, Neunkirchen, Saarpfalz-Kreis, Saarlouis, Saarbrücken (city) and Saarbrücken (region). Approx. 400 investigators and forensic scientists work for the State Investigation Bureau.

The Saarland Police registers its new vehicles with the state government license plate combination SAL 4 - XXXX. SAL stands for Saarland Landesregierung (Saarland state government), 4 denotes police and XXXX is a combination of four numbers.

Once a busy town with an airport, Kyancutta is now nearly a ghost town, acting only as a centre for the agricultural districts surrounding it, as well as passing tourists. History The town was established in 1917 to support the surrounding agricultural lands. The name is thought to be derived from the Aboriginal kanjakatari; kanja – \\"stone\\" and katari – \\"surface water\\", implying water in rocks. Another possible origin is that the name was taken from a nearby hill \\"Kutta kutta\\" which was the local Aboriginal name for the night hawk. An airport was built not long after establishment, and flights between Adelaide and Perth stopped there regularly. This added another facet to the town's economy, and caused the town to fall into a steady decline after its closure in 1935. A school was built in the town in 1920, remaining active for 25 years before closing in 1945. An official weather station, established at Kyancutta in 1928, became Australia's first fully automated station with a three hourly programme of weather observation which is still ongoing under the care of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. In 1986, a memorial park was established to honour the pioneers of agricultural settlement in the area. Economy The town now is the service centre for the surrounding agricultural districts, with cereal crops and sheep grazing the prevalent industries. Grain silos for storage of wheat and field peas are located in Kyancutta at the railway station on the Eyre Peninsula Railway to Port Lincoln. It also serves as a rest point for travellers making their way across the Eyre Highway. Kyancutta has no real attractions of its own, but a number of natural features including Waddikee Rock and Corrobinne Hill do lie within 20 km of the town. Facilities Kyancutta has free camping in the park adjacent the Kyancutta Store. The store does Cafe food and Coffee as well as fuel. For the locals, a post office and a sporting complex including 18 hole golf course, tennis, football and netball facilities are also located in the town.

Above all, he is famous for discoveringLee and Parker, The Yamabe Problem, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.

Other notable contributions include his definitive solution of Hilbert's fifth problem.According to : however, the question is still debated since in the literature there have been other such claims, largely based on different interpretations of Hilbert's statement of the problem given by various researchers. For a review of recent claims (however completely ignoring the contributions of Yamabe) and for a new one, see . For a general review, including an historical sketch dealing with all contributors, see the Hilbert's fifth problem entry. Life Hidehiko Yamabe was born on August 22, 1923 in the city of Ashiya, belonging to the Hyōgo Prefecture, the sixth son of Takehiko and Rei Yamabe.The content of this section is largely based on the commemoration by . After completing the Senior High School in September 1944, he joined Tokyo University as a student of the Department of Mathematics and graduated in September 1947: his doctoral advisor was Shokichi Iyanaga. He was then associated with the Department of Mathematics at Osaka University until June 1956, even while employed by the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. Shortly before coming to the United States of America, Yamabe married his wife Etsuko, and by 1956 they had two daughters. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,According to , who also reports that Yamabe precisely suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage. just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University. Academic career After graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1947, Yamabe became an assistant at Osaka University. From 1952 until 1954 he was an assistant at Princeton University, receiving his Ph.D. from Osaka University while at Princeton. He left Princeton in 1954 to become assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. Except for one year as a professor at Osaka University, he stayed in Minnesota until 1960. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,According to , who also refers that he precisely suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage. just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University. The Yamabe Memorial Lecture and the Yamabe Symposium After coming back to Japan, Etsuko Yamabe and her daughters lived with the benefits of Hidehiko's social security and of funds raised privately by her and her husband's friends in the United States of America.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 6). When she had achieved some financial stability, it was her wish to return the kindness shown to her in a time of great need by setting up funds for an annual lecture, to be alternatively held at Northwestern and Minnesota University: the Yamabe Memorial Lecture was so established, and was able to attract distinguished lecturers as Eugenio Calabi.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 7). Further funding permitted the expansion of the lecture to the present state bi-annual Yamabe Symposium.According to the University of Minnesota School of Mathematics Newsletter (2008 p. 7): see also the brief historical sketch \\"History of the Yamabe Memorial Symposium\\" at the Symposium web page. Work Research activity Yamabe published eighteen papers on various mathematical topics:.According to . These have been collected and published as a book, edited by Ralph Philip Boas, Jr. for Gordon and Breach Science Publishers.See . Half of Yamabe's papers concern the theory of Lie groups and related topics. However, he is best known today for his remarkable posthumous paper, \\"On a deformation of Riemannian structures on compact manifolds,\\" Osaka Math. J. 12 (1960) 21–37. This paper claims to prove that any Riemannian metric on any compact manifold without boundary is conformal to another metric for which the scalar curvature is constant. This assertion, which naturally generalizes the uniformization of Riemann surfaces to arbitrary dimensions, is completely correct, as is the broad outline of Yamabe's proof. However, Yamabe's argument contains a subtle analytic mistake arising form the failure of certain natural inclusions of Sobolev spaces to be compact. This mistake was only corrected in stages, on a case-by-case basis, first by Trudinger (\\"Remarks Concerning the Conformal Deformation of Metrics to Constant Scalar Curvature\\", Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa 22 (1968) 265–274), then by Aubin (Équations Différentielles Non Linéaires et Problème de Yamabe, J. Math. Pures Appl. 9: 55 (1976) 269–296), and finally, in full generality, by Schoen (\\"Conformal Deformation of a Riemannian Metric to Constant Scalar Curvature,\\" Journal of Differential Geometry 20 (1984) 478-495). Yamabe's visionary paper thereby became a cornerstone of modern Riemannnian geometry, and is thus largely responsible for his posthumous fame. For example, as of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet records 186 citations of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal, compared with only 148 citations of all of his other publications combined. As of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet also lists 997 reviews containing the word \\"Yamabe.\\" This, of course, is notably larger than the number of papers that explicitly cite any of Yamabe's articles. However, the vast majority of these reviews contain one of the phrases \\"scalar curvature\\" or \\"Yamabe equation,\\" referring to Yamabe's equation governing the behavior of the scalar curvature under conformal rescaling. In this sense, the influence of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal has become such a universal fixture of current mathematical thought that it is often implicitly referred to without an explicit citation.

It admitted Catholics to the practice of law, permitted the exercise of their religion, and the existence of their schools. On the other hand, chapels, schools, officiating priests and teachers were to be registered, assemblies with locked doors, as well as steeples and bells to chapels, were forbidden; priests were not to wear vestments or celebrate liturgies in the open air; children of Protestants were not to be admitted to the schools; monastic orders and endowments of schools and colleges were prohibited. The sentiment for reform was helped along by the signing of the Edict of Versailles in France in 1787, whereby non-Catholic French subjects were given full legal status in a kingdom where Catholicism had always been the state religion. Terms It was far more extensive and far-reaching than its predecessor, the Papists Act 1778. By it there was again an oath to be taken, in character much like that of 1778, but including an engagement to support the Protestant Succession under the Act of Settlement 1701. No Catholic taking the oath was henceforward to be prosecuted for being a Papist, or for being educated in Catholicism, or for hearing Catholic Mass or saying it, or for being a priest or deacon or for entering into, or belonging to, any ecclesiastical order or community in the Church of Rome, or for assisting at, or performing any Catholic rites or ceremonies. Catholics were no longer to be summoned to take the Oath of Supremacy, or to be removed from London; the legislation of King George I, requiring them to register their estates and wills, was absolutely repealed; while the professions of counsellor and barrister at law, attorney, solicitor, and notary were opened to them.Gerard, John, and Edward D'Alton. \\"Roman Catholic Relief Bill.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 March 2020 It was however provided that all their assemblies for religious worship should be certified at Quarter Sessions; that no person should officiate at such assembly until his name had been recorded by the Clerk of the Peace: that no such place of assembly should be locked or barred during the meeting; and that the building in which it was held, should not have a steeple or bell. The Relief Act of 1791 undoubtedly marked a great step in the removal of Catholic grievances, but the English statesmen felt, along with the Catholic body, that much more was required. William Pitt the Younger and his rival, Charles James Fox, were alike pledged to a full measure of Catholic Emancipation, but they were both thwarted by the obstinacy of King George III, who insisted that to agree to any such measure would be a violation of his coronation oath. There were also at this period considerable dissensions within the Catholic ranks. These concerned first the question of Veto on the appointment of bishops in Ireland, which it was proposed to confer on the English Government, and belongs chiefly to the history of Emancipation in that country. There was another cause of dissension, more properly English, which was connected with the adjuration of the supposed Catholic doctrines contained in the oath imposed upon those who wished to participate in the benefits conferred by the Act of 1791, as previously by that of 1778. The lay members of the Catholic committee who had framed this disclaimer were accused by the Vicars Apostolic, who then administered the Catholic Church in England, of tampering with matters of ecclesiastical discipline; and although the bishops had their way in the matter of the oath, the feud survived, and was proclaimed to the world by the formation in 1792 of the Cisalpine Club, the members whereof were pledged \\"to resist any ecclesiastical interference which may militate against the freedom of English Catholics\\". The Irish Act of 1793 The Act was followed by the Irish Parliament in 1793, with some local provisions such as allowing Catholics to take degrees at Trinity College Dublin.Text of the 1793 Irish Act Catholic schools had already been permitted again by the Irish Act of 1782,http://members.pcug.org.au/~ppmay/acts/relief_act_1782.htm subject to the teachers taking the Oath of Allegiance and obtaining a license from the local Church of Ireland (Protestant) Bishop.

Sequence of events recorders usually have an external time source such as a GPS or radio clock. When wired inputs change state, the time and state of each change is recorded. SERs enable rapid root cause analysis after multiple events have occurred due to the secure recording of the sequence of events in the order of occurrence. SERs are therefore utilized as a diagnostic tool to minimize plant downtime. SERs are often interfaced with a SCADA system, distributed control system (DCS),or programmable logic controller (PLC). SER reports are used by electrical engineers to analyze large and small electrical system blackouts. After the Northeast blackout of 2003, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) specified that electrical system data should be time-tagged to the nearest millisecond. In 1984 The Tetragenics Company, a subsidiary of the Montana Power Company, introduced the first remote terminal unit (RTU) that time-tagged events to the nearest millisecond, and now there are also other RTUs with this capability.

Nowadays virtually uninhabited, Crkvice was most notable as the location of a large Austro-Hungarian military base which was active until the end of World War I, when Montenegro regained control of the area. History Monument in Crkvice dedicated to rebels of the Krivošije Uprising (1869) During the rule of the Austria-Hungary over the Krivošije region, Crkvice was used up as the base military camp. The fortifications, including Fort Kom (Crkvice Ostfort) and Fort Stražnik (Crkvice Westfort), were built by the Austro-Hungarian soldiers in the first half of the 19th Century, and represented the furthest fortification towards the border with Montenegro. During that period, over 150 objects were built in Crkvice, including military training grounds, hotel, tennis courts, bowling alley, football pitch with stands for 1,000 spectators, cinema, church, bakery, hospital, post office, stables, and even a funicular. During the Austro-Hungarian period, Crkvice had up to 10,000 inhabitants. Crkvice bakery was the largest in Balkans at the time, having produced 24 tons of bread per day. The monument dedicated to the victorious rebels of the 1869 Krivošije uprising was put up in Crkvice on its centenary in 1969. Climate Crkvice is within the Mediterranean subtropical belt. While summers are hot and sunny, autumn, winter and spring are rainy seasons. A peculiarity of the littoral Dinarids is the precipitation regime as the settlements of Orjen receive more precipitation than any others in Europe. Like the monsoon rain it is seasonally distributed, thus November thunderstorms sometimes pour 2000 liters of water in several days, while August is frequently completely dry, leading to forest fires. With a maximum discharge of 350 m³/s water one of the biggest karst springs, the Sopot spring near Risan, is a remarkable indicator of this seasonality. Most of the time it is inactive but after heavy rain a remarkable waterfall appears 20 m above the Bay of Kotor. Two wind systems are noteworthy for their ecological significance: bora and jugo. Strong cold downslope winds of Bura type appear in winter and are most severe in the Bay of Risan. Gusts reach 250 km/h and can lead to a significant fall of temperatures in several hours with freezing events problematic for most of the Mediterranean cultures. Jugo is a warm humid wind and is important as it brings heavy rain. It appears throughout the year but is most frequent in autumn and spring.

Hosted by radio personality Rover (Shane French), the show first began at cross-town rival WXTM (92.3 FM) in 2003, quickly becoming one of the top-rated shows in the Cleveland radio market. The show briefly moved to Chicago in 2006 to serve as a regional replacement for The Howard Stern Show, mostly in Midwestern markets, following Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio. Since the move to WMMS in 2008, the show has been syndicated by iHeartMedia. Rover's Morning Glory is under contract to air on WMMS through 2021. History CBS Radio (2003-08) In March 2003, radio personality Rover (Shane French) joined Cleveland modern rock station WXTM (92.3 FM). It was here that Rover created Rover’s Morning Glory - the name itself was thought of just days before the show's premiere and is a double entendre for morning wood. In March 2005, the show began to syndicate with rock station WAZU/Columbus. In October 2005, CBS Radio announced the selection of Rover's Morning Glory to fill several vacancies - mostly in Midwestern markets - soon to result from Howard Stern's move to Sirius Satellite Radio. In January 2006, Rover's Morning Glory moved to Chicago rock station WCKG (105.9 FM); new affiliates included WAQZ/Cincinnati, WKRK-FM/Detroit, WMFS/Memphis, WZNE/Rochester, and KPNT/St. Louis. WXTM/Cleveland continued to carry the show as an affiliate, but also changed its callsign to WXRK and branding to K-Rock. Meanwhile, the previous carrier of the WXRK callsign - Stern's former flagship in New York - adopted the callsign WFNY-FM. The move to Chicago was broadly considered a misstep both on the part of Rover and CBS Radio. The talk format of WCKG skewed more to an audience of 35 years or older, while Rover's show targeted persons between the ages of 18 and 34. Rover’s Morning Glory left WCKG/Chicago in August 2006 and moved the flagship back to his former Cleveland station, WXRK. Memphis and Rochester were the only stations to remain show affiliates following the return to Cleveland. The station itself changed its callsign twice during the show's return: first, to WKRI, as WXRK went back to its former New York station; and then to WKRK-FM, the same callsign used by Rover's former Detroit affiliate. The station continued with the K-Rock brand through both callsign changes. iHeartMedia (2008-present) In February 2008, Rover reportedly informed CBS management that he had signed a contract with cross-town rival WMMS/Cleveland. Rover's Morning Glory was subsequently barred from airing during the remainder of their contract with CBS. The next month, Rover formally announced he would move the show to WMMS; the move was considered \\"a big blow\\" to WKRK-FM/K-Rock Cleveland and \\"a coup\\" for WMMS. Rover's Morning Glory began broadcasting the show from WMMS on April 1, 2008. WMFS, the show's Memphis affiliate since January 2006, abruptly flipped its format and dropped the show in May 2009. In January 2010, Rover's Morning Glory returned to the airwaves in Columbus, Ohio at WRXS after negotiating with the station for more than a year. The show's stint in Columbus proved to be unsuccessful as WRXS would change to a 1990s format that June, canceling Rover's Morning Glory in the process. In June 2013, Rover's Morning Glory began airing a tape delay version on satellite radio over the Extreme Talk channel (XM 243); the channel has since moved exclusively to the iHeartRadio platform, and now airs a live simulcast of the show. Since September 2013, Rover's Morning Glory has also added six new affiliates: WAMX/Huntington; WKGB-FM/Binghamton; WNDE/Indianapolis; WRKK/Williamsport; WTFX-FM/Louisville; WZZR/West Palm Beach; WCZR/Vero Beach and WXEG/Dayton. In February 2015, the show was dropped from WAMX. In August 2015, the show was dropped from WXEG. However, as of May 2017, the show is airing on the station once again. In 2015, the show launched a premium subscription service called RMG Plus. This feature enables listeners to not only watch a live video stream of the entire show each morning, but to access full-show archives dating back to 2012, as well as being able to watch or listen to the Aftermath, which airs Monday-Thursday from 11:05am to noon EST and features cast members Charlie, Shaun (Dumb) Street, Mattitude, Jeffrey LaRocque, and Anthony Snitzer recapping the day's episode and taking calls from listeners, completely uncensored. Fridays from 11:05am to noon EST is a continuation of show that's exclusive to RMG Plus as well and features an uncensored recap of the day's show, as well as various videos and other topics that they weren't able to discuss on the air, due to time constraints or FCC rules. https://www.roverradio.com/category/rmg-plus/ retrieved 2019-01-05 On January 23, 2017, the show added its first new affiliate in over a year with WBFX, \\"101.3 the Brew\\", in Grand Rapids, MI. In March 2017, Rover launched Rolling Glory One, a $2.6 million, 45 foot 2017 Prevost X3 touring bus previously used by Ariana Grande. The bus features a fully functioning mobile studio equipped with video and audio equipment. The show uses the bus to travel to affiliate cities, festivals, and other popular events. On January 6, 2018, Rolling Glory One lead the Perfect Season 2.0 Parade, protesting the Cleveland Browns 0-16 season. Rolling Glory One is sponsored by Travel America and PETRO Stopping Centers.  Stunts  Rover purportedly tied helium balloons to various objects to see how many it would take to lift them off the ground. One was supposedly a kitten, \\"Jinxy the Cat\\", which escaped on a 45-minute flight, followed closely by Cleveland television stations and prompting 911 calls from concerned listeners. The stunt was copied by radio stations in Philadelphia, Denver and in New York by Nick Cannon. Rover later said \\"No, there was no cat out there. It was all theater of the minds.\\"  Dare Dieter  Dominic Dieter began work on the show as a phone-screener. When a full-time on-air position became available, he volunteered to start a segment called Dare Dieter, in which he would do any stunt or dare submitted by listeners every Friday. Dieter said if he ever turned down a dare he would go back to phone-screening, a promise that was often held over his head during the segment by listeners. The feature was ended by Rover and CBS Radio management after Dieter suffered a serious injury and temporary paralysis during a stunt involving a barrel roll in July 2007. Although it is not certain whether the segment will return, an on-air conversation between Dieter and Rover on April 1, 2008 suggested that Dieter may attempt to bring it back. Events and special projects RoverFest An annual beer-drinking festival and concert to celebrate all-things-Rover. The first RoverFest was held June 20, 2008. West 6th Street in the Warehouse District of downtown Cleveland was closed, a large stage was built, and food and beer vendors were present. A competition for girls to be in Rover's annual Miss Morning Glory Calendar was conducted as well. Approximately 10,000 people made their way through the festival, surpassing expectations. RoverFest 2009 was held July 24, 2009 at Voinovich Park in downtown Cleveland. The event again featured a search for girls to be in the 2010 Miss Morning Glory Calendar, along with comedian Jim Florentine, Darryl \\"D.M.C.\\" McDaniels from Run-D.M.C. and the band Saliva. A television special was taped to air on MavTV in October 2009. The event sold out with over 10,000 people attending. RoverFest 2011 was held August 13, 2011 in Eastlake, Ohio at Classic Park. Sick Puppies, Saving Abel, and Coolio performed as main acts. As well as local bands, including \\"BEST ORIGINAL BAND\\" contest winner, Pirates of the Burning River. Comedian Jim Florentine co-hosted the event along with DJ E-V. As usual, the calendar search was held, as well as skits related to the show. RMG Golf Outing An annual golf outing event held during to celebrate end of the summer in Rochester, New York, a long time affiliate with the show. Miss Morning Glory Calendar In 2003, Rover produced his first Miss Morning Glory Calendar (for the 2004 calendar year). The show conducts a search for local, non-professional girls to be in the calendar and offers cash and other prizes to the girl who is crowned Miss Morning Glory, who gets to be featured on the calendar's cover. A large party is held for the release of the calendar (usually in November or December), which usually has all 12 girls in the calendar and everyone from the show on hand to autograph copies of the calendar.  War on the Shore  In July 2005, Dieter fought professional boxer Eric “Butterbean” Esch in a bout billed as “War on the Shore”. Months earlier, Dieter called Esch a fat slob on the air, and the two got into a fight in the studio. Over the next couple of months Dieter trained with a professional fight instructor for his first boxing match. Rover worked with the City of Cleveland to shut down a street in the downtown area, had a ring erected in the middle of the road and brought in beer-vending trucks. Rover told the city he wasn’t sure how many people would attend, but guessed 750. Police estimated over 12,000 people came out to see the three-round fight, forcing the fight to start almost an hour early because of crowd control concerns. Esch knocked Dieter down a number of times during the fight, but each time Dieter was able to get up before the ten-count. It ended in a unanimous decision for Esch on all judges’ scorecards, while Dieter suffered a broken rib. Afterwards, Esch expressed a great respect for Dieter’s ability to withstand the punishment given by a professional fighter, and the two became friends. Esch has since been in-studio and participated in other events with the show. The League of Extraordinary Morons The League of Extraordinary Morons consists of \\"Jackass\\"-style stunts where cast member compete to win money or a new car. The segment airs on a weekly basis, typically on Friday, consisting of physical and eating challenges. Season 1 pitted Chocolate Charlie (Mike Toomey), Dieter, Rob Garguilo, and Dumb (Shaun Street) competing to win a 2011 Kia Soul. The challenges were as follows: * Week 1 - Drinking a blender concoction of disgusting items including chewed bubble gum, live earth worms, tobacco juice, clam juice, anchovies, sardines, wet dog food, dry dog food, live crickets, apple cider vinegar, poached fish testicles, hot sauce, curdled milk, raw eggs, cigarette butts, and tomato juice strained through used panties. Who ever could drink the concoction quickest without puking, won. * Week 2 - Targets were painted on the bare chest of each competitor. The opponent would then shoot paintballs at the target of the opponent to garner points. Highest point total won. * Week 3 - Only two competitors competed in barefoot cactus soccer. The winner was determined by who scored the most goals in a finite time period. * Finals Week 1 - Dieter and Dumb competed in a tackle football game, where the ground was littered with thumb tacks. The competition was named \\"The Field of Screams.\\"  Controversies  An incident on the September 21, 2006 broadcast sparked controversy when, during an interview with \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, the crew asked about the death of Yankovic's parents, causing him to become audibly upset. At the end of the interview, Yankovic hung up abruptly. This was followed by numerous angry calls from both concerned listeners and Al's publicist, during which Rover defended his line of questioning. After the SuccessTech Academy school shooting on October 10, 2007, the \\"Rover's Morning Glory\\" website leaked a crime scene photo taken of the gunman after his suicide. A Cleveland policeman, Walter Emerick, was later found to have taken the picture using his personal cell phone camera. Rover stated on the air it was his intent to show kids the real final result of a school-shooting (the perpetrator lying dead). Steve Loomis, president of the Cleveland police union, claimed the picture could have been taken for legitimate evidentiary purposes. In April 2012, during a \\"best of\\" (a replay from a previously aired show) segment, Dieter replied to a listener's email on air. The email was from a father who had recently seen his teenage daughter kissing another girl. Dieter stated, \\"You should get one of your friends to screw your daughter straight.\\" GLAAD characterized Dieter's statement as advocating corrective rape and called for his immediate suspension. The following Monday, April 30, The Plain Dealer reported that Clear Channel Cleveland Operations Manager Keith Abrams had disciplined Dieter. Although Abrams did not reveal the extent of the disciplinary action, Dieter was not on air for that morning's show. However, the show did air a prerecorded apology from Dieter: \\"I want to genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended by what I said. I regret what I did say. My comments were inappropriate. They were inexcusable, and just downright stupid. And I want to make it clear - there was absolutely no intention to promote physical or sexual violence.\\" According to Aaron McQuade, director of news and field media for GLAAD, WMMS will air several public- service announcements stressing parental acceptance of a gay child's lifestyle. The station has also invited Equality Ohio to become part of the WMMS Community Advisory Board.

Based upon the real-life \\"Ghost Squad\\", writer and creator Tom Grieves explains that the real-life closure of the squad meant that he had to write the story as if the squad continued to operate in secret after officially being shut down. A total of eight episodes were broadcast, including a double-length finale that was split into two-halves for international broadcast.http://www.epguides.com/GhostSquad/ All eight episodes have since been uploaded for streaming on YouTube by the series' production company.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFypBmzyPMA&index;=1&list;=PL67C7518A565EEB2B Charles Pattinson and George Faber served as executive producers.

Based on a story by Antonioni, the film is about a man who wanders aimlessly, away from his town, away from the woman he loved, and becomes emotionally and socially inactive. Il Grido won the Locarno International Film Festival Golden Leopard Award in 1957, and the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon Award for Best Cinematography (Gianni di Venanzo) in 1958. Plot Aldo (Steve Cochran) has worked at the sugar refinery in Goriano for seven years. His long-time mistress, Irma (Alida Valli), learns that her husband, who left for Australia years ago in search of a job, recently died there. Irma goes to the sugar refinery and drops off Aldo's lunch, but does not stay to talk with him. Concerned about her behavior, Aldo goes back to the house where they discuss her husband's death. Aldo suggests that after seven years they can finally get married and legitimize their daughter, Rosina (Mirna Girardi). The next day, Irma reveals that she loves someone else. Aldo can hardly believe her words, saying, \\"All these years, nothing was true.\\" In the coming days he tries desperately to change her mind but it is no use, and the relationship ends with him slapping her in public. Distraught and disillusioned, Aldo leaves Goriano with their daughter Rosina and the two start wandering throughout the Po valley. They stop at the house of his former girlfriend, Elvia (Betsy Blair), a forlorn seamstress who still loves him. He flatters her and helps repair a racing boat owned by the boyfriend of Elvia's younger sister, Edera (Gabriella Pallotta). Later he spends time with Elvia and his daughter watching the river race, with Elvia holding Aldo's arm, but Aldo cannot hide his depression for long. Irma shows up at Elvia's house to deliver Aldo's valise. Elvia has little sympathy for Irma, believing she will regret throwing away her relationship with Aldo. That night Elvia and Aldo go to a dance and have a good time, but Elvia asks to leave early so she can talk with him. Upset that Aldo returned to her only after Irma broke off their relationship, she tells him she received his valise from Irma (but not mentioning Irma's visit). After Aldo explodes in anger at Irma's actions, they both realize his visit was a mistake. Later that evening, Edera returns from the dance a little drunk and flirtatious, and they kiss, but Aldo can only think about Irma. Aldo and his daughter leave early the next morning. Elvia tells her younger sister she is sad to see him go. Aldo is unsuccessful in finding work along the Po valley. When Rosina is almost hit by a car, Aldo slaps her face in front of a school yard of children, humiliating her. She runs off and walks among a group of men from the insane asylum. Her father retrieves her and they get a ride atop a petrol truck, but are forced to disembark before a police check point near a filling station. The truck driver tells Aldo that he'll pick him up the following day when the police are not around. Aldo meets Virginia (Dorian Gray), the attractive widow who runs the filling station, and asks if he and his daughter can stay until he can get a ride. Virginia offers him the shack next to the station and he accepts. The next morning Virginia offers Aldo a job. The truck from the previous day approaches and the driver asks if Aldo still wants the ride, but he declines, choosing to stay. That night their mutual attraction is undeniable and they consummate their desires. The next morning while Aldo and Virginia continue their lovemaking, Rosina goes off with Virginia's father who harasses the new owner of his farm which Virginia recently sold. The new owner complains to Virginia about her father's behavior. Frustrated by her father's erratic behavior, Virginia decides to put him in a retirement home. Later that day Aldo and Virginia make love in an open field partially hidden by large wooden cable spools while Rosina plays nearby. When Rosina discovers them in their passion, she runs off upset. Back at the house, Virginia suggests they can no longer take care of Rosina, and soon Aldo puts her on a bus back to her mother. As the bus pulls away Aldo runs after her saying, \\"I won't forget you ... remember that I love you. I'll always love you.\\" Sometime later, after leaving Virginia, Aldo finds work as a mechanic with a dredge crew. Listening to his boss' tales of travel, Aldo begins planning a trip to Venezuela, but eventually loses interest. While walking along the river, Aldo sees Andreina (Lynn Shaw), a local prostitute living in a riverside shack. Andreina begins flirting with Aldo but he is now being sought by the police and has to rush off. Sometime later, Andreina finds the shack where Aldo is hiding and returns the coat he left. They go for walk along a wide expanse of rivershore as desolate as their future. Aldo tells her about a time when a group of his friends wanted to go to a dance, and a woman named Irma asked him to go to a museum instead. Andreina gets annoyed at the pointless story, despite its importance to Aldo all these years later. He remembers his old refinery job and how, from the tower, he could see his house, the river, and his daughter's school. Andreina remembers being pregnant once, and how it almost got her a man of her own, but the pregnancy \\"went wrong\\". In the coming days the rain falls heavy over the Po valley and the river rises. The roof on Andreina's shack leaks and neither of them have any food. Andreina goes to a nearby restaurant where she intends to sleep with the owner for food. Aldo follows and tries to get her to come back, but she refuses. Aldo leaves dejected. The next day Aldo decides to return to Goriano, getting a ride in the back of a truck that stops at Virginia's filling station. Virginia gives him the valise he left behind and tells him about a postcard that arrived with news from Irma, which she says she has misplaced. Arriving in Goriano, Aldo finds the town in ferment over the construction of a military airfield which the inhabitants object to, and those at work leave their jobs to join the protest. Aldo spots Rosina entering Irma's house and through the window sees that she is content with a new baby and living a better life. As he turns to go, Irma notices him outside and follows him to the refinery which the workers have just quitted. Filled with despair, Aldo climbs to the top of the refinery tower where he once worked. From the ground Irma calls up to him, and he turns and sees her down below. Appearing weak and disoriented, Aldo falls to his death as Irma cries out in despair. She kneels over his dead body.

Seymour Chatman argues that Aldo is overcome with vertigo as he stands atop the tower, causing him to fall to his death. Chatman finds support in the original screenplay, which mentions that Aldo attempts to resist a sudden onset of vertigo as he looks down on the ground.Chatman (1985), p. 40.

Weiler noted the filmmaker's \\"elliptical, mystifying but often engrossing approach\\" to filmmaking and saw Il Grido as a predecessor to L'Avventura and La Notte. Weiler writes: In her review in The Village Voice, Leslie Camhi wrote that the film \\"provides a missing link between Italian neorealism and the director's later work.\\" Camhi praised Antonioni's skill at using landscape to reflect the inner emotions of the factory mechanic and his child who \\"drift aimlessly through a nearly empty, semi-industrial landscape. The camera's spare, stunning compositions and the tone of loss and disaffection anticipate Antonioni's later, brilliant explorations of bourgeois anomie.\\" In his review for the A.V. Club, Keith Phipps saw the film as an important transitional work between Antonioni's neo-realism roots and his later masterpieces. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 80% positive rating among film critics based on 10 reviews, and an 81% positive audience rating based on 1,211 user ratings.

The market occupied the block between Jefferson, Liberty, Floyd and Brook streets. A small section extended south down Floyd Street. It was established in 1891 on the site of the city's earliest rail station, belonging to the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad. The site had been cleared after the station relocated to First Street in 1881. 1891–1962 Local truck farmers used the spot informally in the 1880s to sell goods directly to consumers. A municipal market house on Market Street closed in 1888, the last of such houses on the street. In 1891 some of the farmers formed a stock company to purchase the former rail station space permanently. Despite the name, the Haymarket did not actually sell hay in any meaningful quantities. By the end of the 1890s, city regulations allowed hucksters of fruits, vegetables and other products to use three feet of sidewalk to sell their goods. Many of the purchasers were grocers who would arrive at daybreak to buy goods for resale in their neighborhood stores. Consumers who ventured to Haymarket directly were called \\"curb buyers\\". While buying directly at the Haymarket required much more haggling than in a grocery, better deals could be had. Many of the early vendors were Italian and Lebanese immigrants. In the 1920s open sheds were built as cover from the weather for sellers and buyers. The Haymarket started to decline in the 1940s with the rise of chain groceries. Many vendors left for a suburban, rail-connected market in 1962. A few vendors attempted to hang on at the original site, but a ramp to Interstate 65 was built through the site and Haymarket closed after 71 years on September 1, 1962. 1989–mid 2000s An enclosed Haymarket was in place later at a different location from 1989 to the mid-2000s, which dissolved after \\"it was replaced by the Nucleus Building\\".

They were formed from the ashes of cult doom metal/viking metal band Scald, after the death of Scald's frontman Agyl. From the beginning, Tumulus moved away from Scald's doom metal roots and played folk metal, combining metal music with traditional Russian folk and incorporated instruments as flute, tambourine and balalaika. History Russian Tumulus (not to be confused with the German viking/pagan/black metal band Tumulus) was founded in the fall of 1997 in Yaroslavl, Russia by ex-members of cult doom metal/viking metal band Scald that split up due to the death of the singer and leader of the band Agyl. The name of the new band – Tumulus – is a tribute to his memory and also a title of one of the songs from “Will of the Gods is Great Power” album. Tumulus started working on their own music by putting together elements of ethnic Russian music, progressive rock and progressive metal, ambient music elements. Tumulus musicians describe their music as \\"art progressive folk metal\\"; they use clear leading vocals and folk instruments in the studio and live. Lyrics are written in Russian, ancient Slavonic and English. The lyrics is based on Slavonic spell formulas, rites and everyday magic (that mostly are traditions of northern regions of Russia). After recording two demos - “Krada” (1999) and “Vo Luzeh” (2000), Tumulus started co-operation with a Russian label Wroth Emitter Productions that released their studio albums “Winter Wood” (2004) and “Sredokresie” (2005). Guest vocals on both albums were performed by Marina Sokolova of a folk band Sedmaya Voda – a Russian folk songstresses. At the end of 2006, Tumulus went on their “Folk Art Path” tour and performed live in Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria. One of those live shows, which took place in Sofia, Bulgaria, was recorded and released later, in December 2006, as a live album called “Live Balkan Path” (also on Wroth Emitter Productions). At the end of 2008 the band released a new EP called “Kochevonov Plyas”. In the beginning of 2010 on a label \\"2S Productions\\" is realised new album \\"Vedai\\" (by the limited edition - only for Russia). In the summer of 2011, this album was re-released under the title \\"Vedai - Sacred Knowledge of the Bearland\\" by Romanian label \\"Ygghdrassil Productions\\" for distribution outside of Russia. This re-release contains two exclusive bonus tracks, unavailable on the previous Russian edition. In early 2013, Tumulus has provided a free download three song single \\"Skomrah\\" (which includes a cover version of the cult Yugoslav folk rock band Bijelo Dugme).

It was published in 2006.  Plot summary  In 1993, Harry Bosch and his partner Jerry Edgar caught the Marie Gesto case. Marie was a young equestrian who went missing. Her car and clothing turned up in an apartment garage but her body was never found. Bosch and Edgar had pegged a likely culprit – Anthony Garland, the son of wealthy and powerful industrialist Thomas Rex \\"T-Rex\\" Garland. The younger Garland had dated a woman who closely resembled Gesto and had broken up with him due to his temper; she also had lived in the apartment where Gesto's car was found. However, despite several rounds of questioning Anthony Garland, a part-time security guard at one of his father's oil facilities, detectives never found enough evidence to charge the suspect and the case went cold. Bosch had worked Gesto case as time allowed, calling her parents several times a year so they knew their daughter was not forgotten. In the 13 years since the Gesto case went cold, Bosch had retired from the LAPD and worked as a private investigator for three years but returned to the force because things didn't work out the way he thought they would in retirement. Now, nearing 60, Bosch is working in the prestigious Open-Unsolved Unit at Parker Center, going over cold cases with his most recent partner, Kizmin \\"Kiz\\" Rider. A serendipitous traffic stop in L.A.'s Echo Park neighborhood nabs Raynard Waits, a man with body parts in his van on the floorboard in front of the front seat. Detective Freddy Olivas is working the case and Richard O'Shea is the prosecutor assigned. Soon Waits has confessed to a string of slayings involving prostitutes and runaways, as well as to two earlier murders: one of pawnshop owner Daniel Fitzpatrick during the 1992 riots, the other of Marie Gesto. When the Gesto case files are reexamined, it seems that Waits had called the police shortly after the murder, pretending to be a tipster, but Bosch and Edgar never followed up on the tip. Without this costly error, Waits could have been implicated within a week of Gesto's disappearance and never gone on to kill more victims. Bosch takes the Gesto files to his ex-girlfriend Rachel Walling, an FBI agent and former criminal profiler, asking her opinion on the case so he can have an edge in dealing with Waits. Walling suggests that Raynard Waits might not be his true identity. Raynard is an unusual name, reminding Walling of Reynard the Fox: a trickster character from French folklore known for fooling the authorities and living in a secret castle. Bosch and Walling also discuss why Waits might have been carrying the bodies through Echo Park, when nearby Griffith Park offered a much larger and more rugged area to hide human remains. Bosch suspects Waits felt comfortable in Echo Park, and that the investigation into his crimes had overlooked an important connection to this neighborhood. Bosch and Walling also rekindle their romance that ended abruptly several years earlier. In an interview room with Bosch and several others, Waits confesses to killing Fitzpatrick as a random act during the chaos of the 1992 riots, and to raping and strangling Gesto the next year due to her fitting his fantasy. The disappearance of a middle-class woman attracted too much attention, Waits says, so he subsequently targeted transients and addicts on the fringes of society who would not be missed. He held them captive for several days before killing them. Waits agrees to take police to her body, in exchange for a plea bargain and avoiding the death penalty for any of his crimes. Bosch, O'Shea, Rider, Olivas, a videographer and a forensic investigation team accompany Waits and his attorney Maury Swann to an isolated area in Beachwood Canyon where he leads them to human remains buried in a shallow grave. When departing from the burial site, O'Shea orders Waits's handcuffs removed so he can descend a ladder. Waits uses this opportunity to grab Olivas gun. He shoots three officers, killing Olivas and seriously wounding Rider, and shouts \\"How's your bullshit deal looking now?\\" before escaping into the woods. Bosch tends to Rider. She is shot through the neck and bleeding heavily, but stabilized at the hospital. In line with policy for officer-involved shootings, Bosch is taken off active duty pending review of the incident. Forensic dentistry confirms the remains are Gesto's. In the aftermath of the shooting, Bosch makes two important discoveries: First, he learns that O'Shea has apparently ordered the videotape of the Beachwood Canyon expedition edited to remove his order that Waits's handcuffs be removed, in an attempt to avoid any career- damaging fallout over the incident. Second, in examining copies of case files he made before quitting the police department several years earlier Bosch discovers no evidence that Waits had contacted police shortly after Gesto disappeared. He suspects that the \\"51 sheets\\" (typed summaries of handwritten notes) were altered to make him feel rattled and appear responsible for allowing Waits to escape notice and go on to kill several more people. After analyzing the data, Bosch comes to suspect that Olivas and O'Shea doctored the 51 sheets as part of a plot to help O'Shea's bid to become District Attorney by nabbing a serial killer and closing eleven open murders. Waits, Bosch thinks, was not guilty of the Gesto murder but played along to avoid execution and hoping for a possible chance to escape -- his parting comment about a \\"bullshit deal\\" was presumably directed at O'Shea. With qualified support from Walling, Bosch sets out to investigate his hunches and find where Waits might be hiding. He finds subtle markers on the Beachwood Canyon trail, like recently-cut cut tree limbs, that Waits might have been informed about to find the burial site despite actually having never been there. Keisha Russell, a reporter friend, confirms that T-Rex Garland was a major (though indirect) contributor to O'Shea's election campaign. This seems to confirm Bosch's idea that Waits's confession to the Gesto murder was fake and intended to permanently clear Anthony Garland of suspicion. A closer look at Olivas's files on Waits shows that because Waits was so obviously guilty detectives did not thoroughly research his background. In Fitzgerald's paperwork, Bosch and Walling discover evidence that the pawnshop owner was not a random victim: he had been murdered by a disgruntled customer named Robert Foxworth who soon afterwards falsified a birth certificate to change his name to Raynard Waits. Abel Pratt, Bosch's commanding officer, cautions him about investigating the case after he was removed from active duty. In the meantime, Waits has kidnapped another woman by forcing her into a white van. Walling, using her FBI credentials, obtains a copy of Waits/Foxworth's juvenile criminal record in hopes it will contain information about where he might be holding his newest victim. Knowing Waits tends to hold his victims captive for a few days, Bosch races against the clock to locate Raynard's hideout in Echo Park. Waits was born to an underage mother whose drug habits and prostitution history led to her losing custody of the boy in his infancy. Waits bounced between foster homes and youth detention facilities for most of his young life, exhibiting extreme anger towards women and finding stability only with the Saxon family who he lived with for four years -- in Echo Park. Bosch and Walling locate the Saxon home, where his elderly wheelchair-bound foster mother informs them that \\"Robbie\\" rents the garage. Walling urges him to wait for backup, but Bosch insists on entering sooner because the kidnapping victim is at risk. They break into the garage and are confronted with a locked room mystery -- all three exterior garage doors were locked from the inside, yet there is no sign of Waits. In the white van, Walling discovers duct tape affixed to human hair proving they were on the right track. Suddenly, gunshots ring out, narrowly missing Walling and Bosh. The shots came from behind a large American flag affixed to the wall -- a flag that conceals a tunnel built into the hillside abutment on the backside of the house. Bosch crawls into the tunnel, which is filled with human bones from Waits's victims. Hearing the victim's whimpers, Bosch knows she is alive and attempts to establish rapport with Waits. He explains he knows Waits's real name and how they were both shuttled into the Los Angeles foster care system due to troubled mothers. Waits admits that his lawyer Maury Swann approached him with the plea bargain and false confession, which he accepted only because it gave him a chance to escape. Bosch urges Waits to turn himself in, but in the end is forced to shoot and kill him. Bosch confronts O'Shea with Waits's final confession, but O'Shea denies any wrongdoing. Pratt issues a veiled warning to Bosch, saying that while the Waits shooting appears justified that verdict might change depending on forensic investigation of the Saxon house, and that high-ranking LAPD officers have decided they support O'Shea in the upcoming election. Any scandal that harms O'Shea might be blamed on Bosch, and the forensic data could be slanted to make the shooting seem unjustified. Refusing to play along, Bosch learns from his partner Jerry Edgar that Pratt had been following him continually since he was removed from active duty. Bosch reevaluates his presumptions, now coming to believe that the 51 sheets were most likely altered by Pratt and that Olivas and O'Shea were probably duped along with him. The only question is why Pratt, a decorated veteran approaching retirement, would take such an action. Surveillance proves that Pratt is cheating on his wife with a much younger woman who works in the police personnel office. In a divorce, Pratt could lose everything and thus might be desperate for cash. At Swann's house, Bosch and Walling discover Pratt has forced Swann (who can't swim) into the swimming pool as an intimidation tactic to keep him silent, and overhear damning details of the plot to make Waits take responsibility for the Gesto murder. They arrest both men, and Pratt offers Bosch a deal. If prosecutors agree that Pratt will serve no jail time and keeps his pension plan, he will go on the record saying that Olivas and O'Shea were not involved and further will obtain evidence that the Garlands are behind the scheme, with Anthony Garland leading Pratt to Gesto's hidden grave. Bosch reluctantly agrees, deciding that letting Pratt go free is a price worth paying to finally catch Marie Gesto's killer. Pratt meets the Garlands in a public park to demand more money due to the unexpected complications in the case. An FBI team, along with O'Shea, use video cameras and parabolic microphones to record the conversation. T-Rex Garland admits to paying $1 million to Pratt to shift blame from his son to Raynard Waits. When Pratt goes to the men's room to communicate with the FBI team, Anthony Garland follows him and shoots him to death. Moments later, the FBI arrive at the men's room and shoot Garland when he refuses to comply. Rachel Walling confronts Bosch with her suspicions that he orchestrated the shooting of Pratt, having known that Anthony Garland was hot-tempered and had a concealed carry permit for a handgun due to his security guard job. He denies it, but she departs in anger. Kiz Rider is released from the hospital, telling Bosch that she has decided to change careers to an office job with the LAPD chief of police where, she says, she can possibly protect him from bureaucracy and office politics. He approves, glad that she will be one floor above him like a guardian angel.  Trivia  Raynard Waits was described as a former client of Mickey Haller, a defense attorney character who also stars in a series of books by Connelly. However, this book has no mention of Haller's kinship to Harry Bosch. Cecil C. Dobbs, a character featured in The Lincoln Lawyer from the Haller series, was described as working for the family of the wealthy suspect. Harry Bosch gives his cell phone number out in the book. Those who dial the number reach a voice mail account for Harry Bosch and can leave a message. The first chapter was adapted as a short film. Tim Abell played Bosch, whilst crime author Gar Anthony Haywood played Jerry Edgar. Len Cariou was the narrator. Raynard Waits was portrayed by Jason Gedrick in the TV adaptation Bosch.

At 200 cm tall, he made his AFL debut with the Hawthorn Hawks in 2002. After appearing sporadically in his first few seasons, Campbell starred in 2006 with 230 disposals and 300 hit outs, playing in each of the club's 22 games. In 2007, he became the Hawks' number one ruckman after Peter Everitt's departure to the Sydney Swans. He played in every game for the season, including two finals appearances. Campbell has a reputation for providing value around the ground with his strength and tenacious attitude. Campbell was rewarded for his efforts with a Premiership medallion after the Hawks upset Geelong in the 2008 Grand Final. In percentage terms, no other AFL ruckman hits the ball to the advantage of his on-ballers more often than Campbell according to jini. He has evolved into one of the competition’s most durable and reliable ruckmen, missing only one of the Hawks' past 71 matches. He was first for Hawthorn's hit-outs last season, averaging about 15 a match. Tough competitor who handles the ball well for his size, tackles ferociously and can fill key-position roles when needed. He finished 13th in the Best & Fairest Award (Peter Crimmins Medal) in 2007 & 2008\\\\. Highly underrated in the AFL, Campbell got the job done for the Hawks and was a crucial part of the Premiership side, as the number one ruckman at the Hawks. Draft History: 2001 Rookie Elevation (Hawthorn). Retirement Robbie announced his retirement at the 2009 Hawthorn Peter Crimmins Medal Count on 3 October due to a knee injury. A tearful Campbell thanked fans, players, his family and coaching staff in a heartfelt speech. Comeback He returned to football in 2010 playing in finals and including 8 games for the Box Hill Hawks (VFL) after finding out his knee wasn't as bad as they first thought. Robert then stated he would like to make a comeback to AFL football and would enter the draft at the end of 2010. Campbell was selected by the Melbourne Demons during round 5 at pick number 63 in the 2011 Rookie Draft. Due to Melbourne's strong ruck depth in 2011, notably Mark Jamar Campbell was unable to break into Melbourne's senior team. As a result, he retired at the end of the season.

The Ninth Michigan Infantry organized at Fort Wayne (Detroit), near Detroit, Michigan, from independent companies recruited throughout the state, and mustered into Federal service for a three-year enlistment on October 15, 1861. The Regiment was under the command of William Ward Duffield as colonel and John G. Parkhurst as lieutenant colonel. On the morning of July 13, the Union garrison was attacked by a force of 2,500 cavalry led by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest in what was to be called the First Battle of Murfreesboro. After 8 hours of intense fighting, and suffering casualties of one-third of the fighting force, the 9th surrendered to Forrest. After being exchanged, the six captured companies rejoined the regiment in Bowling Green on November 3, 1862. The Court of Inquiry into the events at Murfreesboro praised the actions of the Ninth, and laid all the blame for the failures at Murfreesboro at the feet of Col. Lester, whom it cashiered. Four other officers from the 3rd Minnesota were also court-martialed for cowardice at Murfreesboro. Second, General Thomas assigned the Ninth to be his headquarters guard. Men of the regiment believed that Gen. Thomas said that \\"he had a special duties for the regiment that had repulsed Forrest three times\\". Finally, Colonel Parkhurst returned to the Regiment. At the Battle of Stones River on December 26, 1862. When the Union right was crushed at Stone River, the Ninth did most gallant service in checking the stampede to the rear, by firmly holding the Nashville Pike, the disorganized forces were stopped and returned to their commands. Major General Thomas complimented Colonel Parkhurst and the Regiment for the very important service rendered at this critical point of battle. The regiment was mustered out on September 15, 1865.  Service  The Ninth Michigan Infantry organized at Fort Wayne (Detroit), near Detroit, Michigan, from independent companies recruited throughout the state, and mustered into Federal service for a three-year enlistment on October 15, 1861. The Regiment was under the command of William Ward Duffield as colonel and John G. Parkhurst as lieutenant colonel. The Ninth was the first Michigan regiment ordered to the western army or the \\"Army of the Ohio\\", as it was called at the time. The regiment was sent to West Point, Kentucky, to build fortifications on Muldraugh's Hill. March 9, the 23rd Brigade was created, consisting of the Ninth Michigan, the 3rd Minnesota, and the 8th and 23rd Kentucky regiments. Col. Duffield was placed in command of the brigade which was ordered to Nashville. This left Parkurst in command of the Ninth, which was ordered to Nashville. The Regiment arrived in Nashville on March 23, and soon moved South to occupy the important city of Murfreesboro. Colonel Duffield left the brigade on May 9, to take command of the Department of Kentucky from the ailing Gen. Burnbridge. This left Col. Lester of the 3rd Minnesota in charge of the brigade. Monday, June 30, four companies (D, E, F and I) of the 9th Michigan, under the command of Major Fox, left Murfreesboro for Tullahoma. Col. Duffield rejoined the 9th in Murfreesboro on July 11, 1862.  Capture at Murfreesboro  At 4:00 A.M. on the morning of July 13, the Union garrison was attacked by a force of 2,500 cavalry led by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest in what was to be called the First Battle of Murfreesboro. Because of decisions made by Col. Lester, the various union forces were camped in different locations. The 9th were attacked furiously by Forrest's forces. At three different times during the fighting, the 9th sent messengers to Col. Lester and the 3rd Minnesota requesting reinforcements. Each time, the request was denied, even though the 3rd Minnesota were not under attack. After 8 hours of intense fighting, and suffering casualties of one-third of the fighting force, the 9th surrendered to Forrest. Col. Duffield was wounded twice during the battle and never returned to the Regiment.Historical sketches of the Ninth Michigan infantry (General Thomas' headquarters guards) with an account of the battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Sunday, July 13, 1862; four years campaigning in the Army of the Cumberlan Forrest then invited Lester, under a flag of truce, to meet with the captured Union officers. Forrest lined the streets of town with as many Confederate soldiers as he could muster, giving the Union commander the impression that he was desperately outnumbered. After returning to his camp, Col. Lester and the 3rd Minnesota surrendered to Forrest, without having fired a shot.Minnesota Historical Society - Col. Henry C. Lester Civil War Sword The six captured companies of the Ninth were paroled, and made their way to Camp Chase, just outside Columbus Ohio. Eventually most of the regiment found their way home, waiting for word of their exchange so they could again take up arms.  Tullahoma Companies  The other four companies remained at Tullahoma for some time, continuing to fortify that location. A month later, August 29, 1862, Forrest attacked the Union garrison at McMinnville, Tennessee, which consisted of the 18th Ohio and Company D of the Ninth Infantry. Thirteen of Forrest's men were killed in the attack; however none the Union garrison's defenders were mortally wounded. The following month, September 11, 1862, the companies engaged Forrest at Tyree Springs, Tennessee. Its only casualty was Major Fox's son, Charles, who died twelve days later. The Ninth would endure only two other combat deaths during its existence. Both of them died in October 1864, from wounds suffered at Atlanta. Major Fox escorted his son's body home for burial, but did not return to the Ninth Regiment. He resigned on January 29, 1863, and was immediately commissioned colonel and charged with raising and organizing the Twenty- seventh Michigan Infantry.  Reconstitution at Bowling Green  After finally being exchanged, the six captured companies rejoined the regiment in Bowling Green on November 3, 1862. On Christmas Eve, three events happened which lifted the regiment's spirits tremendously. First a Court of Inquiry into the events at Murfreesboro praised the actions of the Ninth, and laid all the blame for the failures at Murfreesboro at the feet of Col. Lester, whom it cashiered. Four other officers from the 3rd Minnesota were also court- martialed for cowardice at Murfreesboro. Second, General Thomas assigned the Ninth to be his headquarters guard. Men of the regiment believed that Gen. Thomas said that \\"he had a special duties for the regiment that had repulsed Forrest three times\\". Finally, Colonel Parkhurst returned to the Regiment. The Court of Inquiry report was so favorable to Colonel Parkhurst that Gen Thomas appointed him Provost Marshal of the XIV Corp, and the ninth was made provost guards of General George Thomas' Fourteenth Corps, Army of the Cumberland as it was now called.

If the research is high-quality, certain to be beneficial, and not going to inflict suffering, then it will fall into the hollow section (top front) meaning research should proceed. Painful, low-quality research with lower likelihood of success will be lower back in the solid area, and should not proceed. Most research will not be clear-cut, but the guiding principle is 'hollow' should continue, 'solid' should not.
