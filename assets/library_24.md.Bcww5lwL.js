The clause says that the accused shall be entitled to an \\"impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law\\".U.S. amend. VI (emphasis added). The Vicinage Clause limits the vicinity of criminal jury selection to both the state and the federal judicial district where the crime has been committed. This is distinct from the venue provision of Article Three of the United States Constitution, which regulates the location of the actual trial. The Vicinage clause has its roots in medieval English criminal procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period (when trials for treason were being held in England rather than in the colony where the crime is alleged to have happened) and Anti- federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause is one of the few constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, the other being the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Clause has led to very little litigation, in part because of its overlap (as a practical matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, with the exception of the Court for the District of Wyoming, whose district includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (except, historically, the District of Potomac, which existed from February 1801 to March 1802). Background English law during the Colonial period Blackstone wrote that English juries must be composed of residents of the county. The Oxford English Dictionary defines \\"vicinage\\" as \\"A number of places lying near to each other taken collectively; an area extending to a limited distance round a particular spot; a neighbourhood.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Vicinage\\" (2d ed. 1989). The OED cites Thomas Fuller's Church History (1655): \\"King Ethelred . . . began the tryal of Causes by a Jury of twelve men to be chosen out of the Vicenage.\\" According to Blackstone, in medieval England, the \\"vicinage of the jury\\" referred to a jury drawn from the relevant county.Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 94 n.35 (1970) (citing 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *350-51). A 1543 statute of Henry VIII of England permits treason committed outside the \\"realm\\" to be tried \\"before such commissioners, and in such shire of the realm, as shall be assigned by the King's majesty's commission.\\"35 Henry VIII, cl. 2 (1543). Parliament renewed the statute in 1769.Kershen, 1976, at 806. This law was used to try colonists accused of treason in England.16 Parliamentary History of England from Earliest Period to the Year 1803, at 476-510 (T. Hansard ed. 1813). A 1772 statute of George III of the United Kingdom permits destruction of dockyards, magazines, ships, ammunition, and supplies committed outside the \\"realm\\" to be tried in any \\"shire or county within this realm.\\"12 George III, cl. 24 (1772). A 1772 statute permitted capital crimes committed in Massachusetts to be tried in England or a neighboring province if \\"an indifferent trial cannot be had within\\" Massachusetts.14 George III, cl. 39 (1774). Protests from the Revolutionary period The Virginia House of Burgesses condemned the renewal of the treason law on May 16, 1769 in the Virginia Resolves: :[A]ll Trials for Treason, Misprison for Treason, and for any Felony or Crime whatsoever, committed and done in this his Majesty's said Colony and Dominion, by any Person or Persons residing therein, ought of right to be had, and conducted in and before his Majesty's Courts, held within the said Colony, according to the fixed and known Course of Proceedings; and that the seizing of any Person or Persons, residing in this Colony, suspected of any Crime whatsoever, committed therein, and sending such Person or Persons to Places beyond the Sea, to be tried, is highly derogatory of the Rights of British subjects . . . .Kershen, 1976, at 806; Blume, 1944, at 64-65. The same resolution referred to the \\"inestimable Privilege of being tried by a Jury from the Vicinage.\\"Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1766–1769, at 214 (J. Kennedy ed. 1906). The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress adopted on October 14, 1774, resolved: :That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law.1 Journals of the Continental Congress 69 (1904). On October 26, 1774, the Continental Congress approved an address to the people of Quebec, drafted by Thomas Cushing, Richard Henry Lee, and John Dickinson, arguing that: :[One] great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, liberty nor property, can be taken from the possessor, until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage, who from that neighbourhood may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with his character, and the characters of the witnesses . . . .1 Journals of the Continental Congress 107 (1904). The United States Declaration of Independence (1776) accuses King George III of \\"transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences.\\" (U.S. 1776). Drafting of the Constitution The New Jersey Plan contained a provision that: \\"[N]o person shall be liable to be tried for any criminal offense, committed within any of the United States, in any other state than that wherein the offense shall be committed . . . .\\"Kershen, 1976, at 808. The proposals of Alexander Hamilton and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were similar. The Committee of Detail and Committee of the Whole amended this language and included it within Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three. Article III provides: \\"The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.\\"U.S. Art. III, § 2, cl. 3. This provision received almost no debate in the Constitutional Convention. The omission of a vicinage right from the United States Constitution was among the objections of the Anti-federalists to the ratification of the Constitution.Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 49 (2004) (citing R. Lee, Letter IV by the Federal Farmer (Oct. 15, 1787), reprinted in 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 469 (1971)). James Madison explained the omission of a vicinage clause in the Virginia Ratifying Convention as follows: :It was objected yesterday, that there was no provision for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, it would not have been opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.Williams, 399 U.S. at 94 n.35 (quoting 3 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention 332 (1911)). Virginia ratified the Constitution, with a proviso that a Bill of Rights, including a right to \\"trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage,\\" be added by amendment.Kershen, 1976, at 816-17. North Carolina adopted the same proviso as Virginia, but refused to ratify the Constitution in its absence. New York and Rhode Island ratified the constitution with similar provisos as Virginia (but, in the case of Rhode Island, the Sixth Amendment had already been sent to the states for ratification).Kershen, 1976, at 817 & n.54. The ratifying provisos of Massachusetts did not include a vicinage right; a proviso including a vicinage right was considered and rejected in Pennsylvania.Kershen, 1976, at 817. Drafting of the Clause House James Madison both defended the absence of a vicinage provision in the Constitution and pushed for more stringent vicinage language in the Sixth Amendment. James Madison's (A-VA) original draft of the jury provision of the Sixth Amendment provided: :The trial of all crimes (except in cases of impeachment, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites . . . provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy, or in which a general insurrection may prevail, the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state, as near as may be to the seat of the offence.1 Annals of Cong. 435 (1789). Madison intended this language to replace Article Three, Section Two, Clause Three, rather than be appended to the Constitution.Kershen, 1976, at 818-19. The Committee of Eleven of the House amended Madison's language as follows: :The trial of all crimes (except in cases of impeachment, and in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when on actual service in the time of war, or public danger,) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites . . . . [B]ut if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy, or in which an insurrection may prevail, the indictment and trial may by law be authorized in some other place within the same State; and if it be committed in a place not within a state, the indictment and trial may be at such place or places as the law may have directed.1 Annals of Cong. 759 (1789). Aedanus Burke (A-SC) proposed that \\"vicinage\\" be replaced by \\"district or county in which the offence has been committed.\\"Kershen, 1976, at 821. Richard Henry Lee (A-VA) argued that \\"vicinage\\" was better, \\"it being a term well understood by every gentleman of legal knowledge.\\" Rep. Burke's amendment was defeated. As amended by the Committee of Eleven, this language passed the House. The Committee of Three, undertaking the task of transforming the amendments to the body of the Constitution into a separate Bill of Rights, moved the language to Article X and deleted the language concerning crimes not committed within a state.Kershen, 1976, at 821-22. Senate The Senate debated the Bill of Rights from September 2 to September 9 and returned a version to the House on September 10.Kershen, 1976, at 822. The Senate deleted every clause from the House version of the Sixth Amendment, with the exception of the grand jury indictment clause.Senate Journal, Sept. 4, 1789, 1st Cong., 1st Sess., at 71. A motion to restore the House wording failed.Senate Journal, Sept. 9, 1789, 1st Cong., 1st Sess., at 77. Little is known about the Senate debate due to the illness of Senator Samuel Maclay whose journal is a key source for the proceedings of the Senate during the first Congress.Williams, 399 U.S. at 94-95 & n.38. A September 14, 1789 letter from Madison to Edmund Pendleton reports: :The Senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alternations, which strike, in my opinion, at the most salutary articles. In many of the States, juries, even in criminal cases, are taken from the State at large; in others, from districts of considerable extent; in very few from the County alone. Hence a dislike to the restraint with respect to vicinage, which has produced a negative on that clause. . . . Several others have had a similar fate.Williams, 399 U.S. at 95 n.39 (quoting Letter from James Madison to Edmund Pendleton, Sept. 14, 1789, in 1 Letters and Other Writing of James Madison 491 (1865)). Conference Committee The altered form in which the Senate returned the Bill of Rights to the House led to a conference committee composed of members of both bodies.Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 409 (1972). The members of the committee from the House proposed that the jury simply be defined as comporting with \\"the accustomed requisites.\\"Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 409 (citing Letter from James Madison to Edmund Pendleton, Sept. 23, 1789, in 5 Writings of James Madison 424 (G. Hunt ed. 1904)). The members of the committee from the Senate were opposed to constitutionalizing the vicinage requirement, believing that the vicinage provisions of the first Judiciary Act (already being debate) were sufficient.Williams, 399 U.S. at 95. A second letter from Madison to Pendleton recounts that the Senators were :inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of Juries. The vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term; too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of the law, too strict if limited to the county. It was proposed to insert after the word Juries, \\"with the accustomed requisites,\\" leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment of professional men. Even this could not be obtained. The truth is that in most of the States the practice is different, and hence the irreconcilable difference of ideas on the subject. In most States, jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community indiscriminately; in others, from large districts comprehending a number of Counties; and in a few only from a single County. The Senate suppose, also, that the provision for vicinage in the Judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the fears which called for an amendment on this point.Letter from James Madison to Edmund Pendleton, Sept. 23, 1789, in 1 Letters and Other Writing of James Madison 492-93 (1865)). The committee adopted the version that passed Congress and was ratified by the states: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . Interpretation The Vicinage Clause may allow the commission of the \\"perfect crime\\" in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park. \\"Jury...\\" The Vicinage Clause applies only to petit juries, not grand juries, although some cases finding no violation of the Clause have assumed without deciding that the Clause does apply to grand juries.Kershen, 1977, at 173 (\\"The concept of vicinage is inapplicable to the grand jury.\\"). \\"...of the State and district...\\" In murder cases arising from the Indian Territory,United States v. Dawson, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 467, 487 (1853) (holding that the Clause \\"applies only to the case of offences committed within the limits of a State\\"). Navassa Island,Jones v. United States, 137 U.S. 202, 211 (1890) (holding that \\"a crime not committed within any state of the Union may be tried at such place as congress may by law have directed\\"). and the No Man's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle,Cook v. United States, 138 U.S. 157, 181 (1891) (holding that \\"if [the Vicinage Clause] import[s] immunity from prosecution where the district is not ascertained by law before the commission of the offense, or that the accused can only be tried in the district in which the offense was committed, (the district having been established when the offense was committed) the amendment has reference only to offenses against the United States committed within a state\\"). the Supreme Court has held that the Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes committed outside the territory of a state. The Clause does not require a jury drawn from the judicial division (a subset of a federal judicial district) within which the crime occurred; rather, the jury may be drawn from any division of the district.United States v. Grisham, 63 F.3d 1074, 1081 (11th Cir. 1995); Spencer v. United States, 169 F. 562, 563-64 (8th Cir. 1909); Clement v. United States, 149 F. 305, 309-11 (8th Cir. 1906). Nor does the Clause prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a judicial division, or any other subset of a judicial district (rather than the entire judicial district).Lewis v. United States, 279 U.S. 63, 72-73 (1929) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation in a jury drawn from only a subset of the Eastern District of Oklahoma); Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 480, 482 (1918) (\\"It is contended that plaintiffs in error were not tried by a jury of the state and district in which the crime was committed, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because the jurors were drawn not from the entire district but only from one division thereof. The proposition disregards the plain text of the Sixth Amendment, the contemporary construction placed upon it by the Judiciary Act of 1789 expressly authorizing the drawing of a jury from a part of the district, and the continuous legislative and judicial practice from the beginning.\\" (citation omitted)); United States v. Herbert, 698 F.2d 981, 983-84 (9th Cir. 1983); United States v. Gottfried, 165 F.2d 360, 363-65 (2d Cir. 1948) (L. Hand, J.); Sedlund v. United States, 97 F.2d 742 (7th Cir. 1938); United States v. Merchants' & Miners' Transp. Co., 187 F. 355 (C.C.S.D. Ga. 1911); United States v. Peuschel, 116 F. 642, 645-47 (S.D. Cal. 1902); United States v. Ayres, 46 F. 653 (D.S.D. 1891); but see United States v. Dixon, 44 F. 401 (N.D. Cal. 1890). \\"...wherein the crime shall have been committed,...\\" The \\"wherein the crime shall have been committed\\" language of the clause is in parallel with the venue provision of Article Three--\\"where the said Crimes shall have been committed.\\"--and with Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--\\"where the offense was committed.\\" 18. The three provisions have been interpreted in tandem to refer to the locus delicti of the offense.United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 278-82 (1999). \\"...which district shall have been previously ascertained by law\\" Lower courts are split on whether the Clause requires that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence at the time the crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does.Mizell v. Beard, 25 F.2d 324 (N.D. Okla. 1928) (granting a writ of habeas corpus for a prisoner by a jury from the Middle District of Georgia--formed from portions of the Northern District of Georgia and the Southern District of Georgia--for an offense committed within the former Southern District of Georgia); United States v. Maxon, 26 F. Cas. 1220 (C.C.E.D.N.Y. 1866) (No. 15,748) (granting motion to quash indictment for crime committed in Brooklyn naval yard, which had been transferred from the Southern District of New York to the Eastern District of New York after the crime). Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial.United States v. Louwsma, 970 F.2d 797, 800-02 (11th Cir. 1992) (affirming a conviction for an offense committed in the former Southern District of Florida with a jury drawn from the Middle District of Florida--which was formed from parts of the Northern District of Florida and the Southern District of Florida); Quinlan v. United States, 22 F.2d 95, 96 (5th Cir. 1927) (affirming a conviction by a jury from the Middle District of Georgia--formed from portions of the Northern District of Georgia and the Southern District of Georgia--for an offense committed within the former Southern District of Georgia); Lewis v. United States, 14 F.2d 369, 370-71 (8th Cir. 1926) (reversing a conviction on other grounds but holding that a jury of the Northern District of Oklahoma--formed from portions of the Eastern District of Oklahoma and the Western District of Oklahoma--could try an offense committed in the former Eastern District of Oklahoma). Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district but retains the former configuration for past offenses.United States v. Benson, 31 F. 896, 897-98 (C.C.D. Cal. 1887) (Field, J.) (denying a motion to dismiss an indictment and holding that the District of California had not ceased to exist); United States v. Hackett, 29 F. 848, 849 (C.C.N.D. Cal. 1887) (denying a motion to quash because the former District of California was preserved for past offenses, but stating in dicta that \\"it is plain that a jury of the Northern district could not try an offender who has committed a crime while the district comprised the whole state, neither could a jury of the Southern district try him\\"). Incorporation The Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.Caudill v. Scott, 857 F.2d 344 (6th Cir. 1988); Cook v. Morrill, 783 F.2d 593 (5th Cir. 1986); Zicarelli v. Dietz, 633 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1980). Zone of death In 2005, Professor Brian C. Kalt of Michigan State University College of Law put forth an argument that the Vicinage Clause, requiring jury selection from the state and district, may permit the commission of the \\"perfect crime\\" (technically, more of an \\"unprosecutable crime\\") in the portion of Yellowstone National Park within the state of Idaho and that a less perfect crime could be committed in the lightly populated portion of the park contained within the borders of the state of Montana. The entire park has been placed within the jurisdiction of the Court for the District of Wyoming, but the Idaho-state portion of the park has no residents with which to form a jury.Kalt, 2005, at 77-79. Kalt argues that two arguments the government might make in favor of prosecution would be unsuccessful: that the Idaho portion of the park is not part of a stateKalt, 2005, at 679-81. and that the judicial district could be changed after the crime.Kalt, 2005, at 681-82. However, Kalt argues that the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial strategies that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government might be able to charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere).Kalt, 2005, at 682. Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach.Kalt, 2005, at 682-83. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime.Kalt, 2005, at 683-85. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause.Kalt, 2005, at 685-87. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.Kalt, 2005, at 683. The defendant could also be charged under state law if it was violation of that as well. Others have noted that the prosecution could simply move for a change of venue due to the impossibility of finding an impartial jury in the location where the crime was committed. A similar problem was cited by the Nevada Legislature in 1989 when it dissolved Bullfrog County, an uninhabited county (the only uninhabited county in the history of the United States) created in 1987 for the sole purpose of shifting federal transfer payments related to the creation of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the Nevada state treasury. Similar provisions in state constitutions Before the adoption of the federal Constitution, only two state constitutions provided an explicit vicinage right.Kershen, 1976, at 815. The Virginia Constitution of 1776 provided: \\"in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to . . . an impartial jury of twelve men of his vicinage.\\" The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 read similarly, but said \\"county\\" instead of \\"vicinage\\"; it was amended in 1790 to say \\"vicinage.\\"Kershen, 1976, at 815-16. By contrast, four of the original thirteen state constitutions contained explicit criminal venue provisions.Kershen, 1976, at 807. New Hampshire (1784) and Georgia (1777 and 1789) required crimes to be tried in the county where committed. Maryland (1776) and Massachusetts (1780) contained similar provisions. § XVIII (1776), in 5 The Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws, at 1686, 1688 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909). In Coleman's Appeal (1874), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that \\"a man shall only be liable to be called on to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home, and the tribunal of his vicinage.\\"Coleman's Appeal, 75 Pa. 441, 458 (1874).

Biography Leonid Artamonov, was born in the Ananyevsky Uyezd of Kherson Governorate on February 25, 1859.Russian Army - Leonid Artamonov He studied in the Michailovsky Cadet School, then Artamonov after his graduation from the Military Engineering-Technical University in 1883, he also graduated from the General Staff Academy. In 1897, he was a member of the Russian diplomatic mission to Ethiopia, where he became a military adviser of Negus Menelek II of Ethiopia. During 1897–1898, he became a military aide of Menelik II in his boundary confrontation against the British colonialists. Artamonov was one of a contingent of Russian officer volunteers attached to the forces of Ras Tessema. He joined the expedition of the Ethiopian army to the White Nile and provided help to overcome serious difficulties. The British, after colonizing the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, exerted new pressure on Ethiopia, which lessened only after the beginning of the 1899–1902 Second Boer War. He was viewed as one of the best Russian military experts of Russia, a competent analyst with combat experience and a strong military and engineering education. But his performance at Tannenberg did not live up to this reputation.Prit Buttar, 2014. Collision of Empires, the War on the Eastern Front in 1914. Osprey Publishing. After Artamonov returned to Russia, he became a member of the Russian Geographical Society. He wrote a book Through Ethiopia to the White Nile about his experiences in Ethiopia. He described in detail the democratic experiments of Menelik II in the traditional patriarchal public dialog of the Ethiopian monarchy with its own people, similar to the later speeches of U. S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1899, for his feats and courage he was awarded the Order of the Star of Ethiopia. He was the leader of group of military analysts and editor of their collected analyses on the Anglo-Boer War, 1899-1902.Seeking the secrets of war. Russian military observers at the South African War(1899-1902) He was the commander of the fortresses of Vladivostok (1906) and Kronstadt (1907). From 1911 until 1914, he was the commander of the First Russian Army Corps. At the Battle of Tannenberg (1914), his corps was to protect the left wing of the 2nd Russian Army. He withdrew his forces without informing his commander Samsonov which contributed to the Russian defeat. For this error, he was relieved of command on August 28. After 1917, he continued his scientific, engineering and military activity for the Soviet government. In 1927, he was the expert of the Moscow city government.

The Declaration of Rights opens the Maryland Constitution and has appeared in some form in all Maryland Constitutions since the first version in 1776. The Declaration began with 42 distinct articles and now, after amendments, contains 47. These include the guarantee of free speech, protection for people involved in legal cases, a prohibition on monopolies, and, by 1972 amendment, equal rights for the sexes under the law.  Origins  The Maryland Declaration of Right was created at the 1776 Assembly of Freemen in Annapolis. On August 1, 1776, freemen with property in Maryland elected 76 delegates. They met from August 14 to November 11 and during that time drafted and approved the new Maryland's first constitution—of which the Declaration of Rights is the lead statement.Smith & Willis, Maryland Politics and Government (2012), p. 136. There are no known records of the proceedings of this convention.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), p. 640. The original Declaration contains 42 articles. The first version of the Declaration of Rights contrasts the new government of Maryland with the tyrannical British Monarchy.Reynolds, \\"The Continued Importance of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1989), p. 3. The 1776 Declaration declared Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches \\"forever separate and distinct\\"—establishing a separation of powers doctrine far more explicit than the one which came later in the Federal Constitution. The Maryland Declaration of Rights bears some similarities to the Virginia Declaration of Rights, created as an independent document in May–June 1776, and the Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights, ratified as part of Pennsylvania's constitution in September 1776. Some parts of the Declaration resemble the Magna Carta.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), p. 644.  Transformation  The adoption of a new constitution in 1851 was motivated largely by a power imbalance between Maryland's two shores, as well as the related issue of slavery.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), p. 640–641. At this point, the preamble of the Declaration changed from a condemnation of the British monarchy to a shorter introductory clause.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), p. 647. When the General Assembly held a constitutional convention in 1864, the state of Maryland was occupied by the federal military. The Union army had run the election of 1863 and heavily pushed the \\"Unconditional Union\\" party, which favored an end to legal slavery. The Maryland Constitution of 1864 reflects this pressing agenda.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), pp. 641–642. \\"The 1863 elections took place in the long shadow of the National Government. General Robert C. Schenck of the Union Army Corps, headquartered in Baltimore, openly advocated the election of the Unconditional Union ticket. Further, to consolidate Union strength and in fear of agitation, Schenck virtually took military control of the supervision of the election. Under such conditions, it is not surprising that the Unconditional Union ticket won an overwhelming victory. When the new General Assembly session began on January 6, 1864, among the first items was a call for a constitutional convention.\\" Political fortunes reversed after the war, as the opposition once again had free rein. The Democrats won large electoral victories and assembled another constitutional convention in 1867.Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), p. 642. The 1867 convention deleted summarily a statement added in 1864, \\"That we hold it to be self-evident, that all men are created equally free; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, the enjoyment of the proceeds of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness.\\"Friedman, \\"History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1998), pp. 648, 684. In 1971–1972, Maryland deleted the reference to \\"white men\\" as the only voters, legal suffrage having already been guaranteed for black men and women of any color designation by, respectively, the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments to the federal constitution.Friedman, \\"Magnificent Failure Revisited (1999), p. 545. Voters in 1972 approved Article 46, an \\"Equal Rights Article\\", which guaranteed, \\"Equality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\\"  Ennumerated rights  The Declaration establishes a government for Maryland based on popular sovereignty. Article 1 states that \\"all Government of Rights originates from the People, is founded in compact only, and instituted solely for the good of the whole.\\" Article 6 states that government officials are: > Trustees of the Public, and, as such, accountable for their conduct: > Wherefore, whenever the ends of Government are perverted, and public liberty > manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the > People may, and of right ought, to reform the old, or establish a new > Government; the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and > oppression is absurd, slavish and destructive of the good and happiness of > mankind. The Declaration has a provision for free speech: Article 40, which stipulates, \\"That the liberty of the press ought to be inviolably preserved; that every citizen of the State ought to be allowed to speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that privilege.\\"Reynolds, \\"The Continued Importance of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1989), p. 4. The Declaration of Rights has been construed in some cases as protecting individual rights where the federal Bill of Rights may not. In Choi v. State (1989), the Maryland Court of Appeals held that Article 22 of the Declaration of Rights—\\"That no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case\\"—extends further than the analogous Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it provides an unconditional right that cannot be irrevocably waived for the duration of a trial.Reynolds, \\"The Continued Importance of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\" (1989), pp. 3–4. \\"The court there was presented with the question of whether a witness had waived her privilege against compelled self-incrimination, by making an earlier statement to the police. The Court, after discussing the case law under the Fifth Amendment, found that even if the witness had waived her privilege under federal law, 'she certainly did not waive her privilege ... under Art. 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.' The privilege, in other words, can be asserted at 'any stage of the inquiry.'\\"  References   Bibliography  * Friedman, Dan. \\"The History, Development, and Interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\\".

In 1996 Kit Kars Ltd changed its name to Alternative Cars Limited. Initially the company operated from the owner's home, until moving to a small 600 square foot workshop in Auckland.  Background  In the early 1980s Hooper decided to build his own MG TF using a Triumph Herald chassis.Kiwi TF, Kit Car, UK Magazine, August 2004 Many kit car companies in the United Kingdom were using the Herald as a donor vehicle because it provided all the mechanical parts required. By 1983 the car was completed and shown at the Auckland Motor Show. Enough interest was generated to indicate demand for the vehicle in kit form. In 1984 Hooper commenced production, trading as Kit Cars Limited. Warwick Tweedy also joined at this time to assist in the marketing and development of the car. Tweedy left the company 1997.Impressions, Which Kitcar, UK, Aug 2005, pages 70–72 Alex Rohde, who had developed the one piece body mould for the T Mark 2 was contracted and consulted from 1997 to make all the steel work for the T car including the steel/brass grills. His company was Multicraft Services Ltd, later known as Rohde Engineering. Jim Woonton was the upholsterer for most of the cars. Prior to 1992 the company had used various fiber-glass laminating companies. From 1992 it created AC Fiberglass with one person was operating in a 1200 square feet of factory. By 1996 the company had grown to 11 staff and 12000 sq feet of factory space.  Overseas markets  In the late 1980s Hooper decided that the local market was too small for future growth and decided to develop a chassis and redesigned car for the Australian market. Richard Wong, a consultant design engineer was employed to design the items required by the Australian Design Rule specifications. Walter Wing replaced him. In 1996 the T Mark 5 was sent to Australia. Bill Walters was appointed the Australian distributor. In 2001 to meet Australian compliance issues the motor upgraded to an injected motor from the Mazda MX5. It was launched at the 2001 National motor Show. In 2002 Daryl Swaine took over the Australian distributorship and retained the name Alternative Cars Australia Pty Ltd. Swaine also rented out two Mark 5 T Cars, his own white one and the demonstrator from New Zealand. By 2000 Hooper decided to develop a model for left hand drive markets, primarily the United States. The model was designed around a Mazda MX5 donor car. At the 2002 Carlisle Kit Car Show in Pennsylvania Hooper obtained a commitment from an interested party to being an agent and the option to show the model at Knotts Berry Farm Kit Car Show in April 2003. Rohde lead the development team and the car was shipped on the 3 March 2003. It won the Peoples Choice trophy at Knotts Berry Farm and was shown at the Carlisle National Kit Car Show in Pennsylvania.MG Alternative – New Zealand Manufacturer Combines Traditional Looks With Modern Performance, Harold Price, Kit Car, September 20092003 Kit Car Nationals Car Show – Wet Cars, Sunny Future The '03 Carlisle Kit Car Nationals Were Rainy But Bright With Exciting Car Debuts, Mike Blake, Kit Car, February 2009 TGs are currently sold in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom (Alternative Cars (International) Limited), and Australia.Alternative TG Sports, Which Kit, UK Magazine, June 2003, pages 27–28  ModelsAlternative Drivestyles: New Zealand Custom Built Cars, Patrick Harlow, Transpress, 2011, , 9781877418136   T cars  * Mark 1 (1983–1985) Triumph Herald chassis and mechanical parts, plywood floor and firewall, fibreglass grill with rod bars, and a tub made up of 5 panels.

It measured 1280 paces or in circumference and had an average thickness of between and and a height of . It had five town gates and was first mentioned in the year 1111. Sections of the wall collapsed in the 18th century due to neglect, and many stones were then used as building material for other buildings in the town. The last large section of the wall was demolished in 1901. Now there are only two sections of the Medieval wall that still remain. One section of the wall supports a flower bed to the east of Cardiff Castle on Kingsway, and the second, larger section forms the rear of a shop on Queen Street in an unmarked alleyway immediately on the other side of Kingsway, between the Northgate Building and One Kingsway. History of the wall John Speed's map of Cardiff in 1610, showing the town wall gates, but with much of the west wall missing. The wall was constructed by Robert Fitzhamon the Lord of Glamorgan, and was first mentioned in 1111 by Caradoc of Llancarfan in his book Brut y Tywysogion (Chronicle of the Princes). By 1184, Maurice de Berkeley had built wooden palisades with South, North, East and West Gates. Gilbert de Clare later strengthened the defences of Cardiff Castle and the wooden palisades were replaced by stone walls. The town walls measured 1280 paces or in circumference, with an average thickness of between and and a height of . In 1404, forces of Owain Glyndŵr, the last native Prince of Wales, destroyed much of the wall by the West Gate. It may have been that the town was completely burnt down except for the Grey Friary outside the East Gate. In 1451, a charter granted by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, mentioned that Cardiff had been re-fortified, with new walls, towers, gates and ditches. A century later John Leland, in his Itinerary of 1536–39, described Cardiff as having a wall with five gates. During the 16th century travelling writers described Cardiff's town wall as being intact, and it began to deteriorate around 1550 to 1560. In 1607 and 1703 Cardiff flooded, caused by a high tide and heavy rain, which would have caused damage to the west wall. From the 18th century, the deterioration of the town wall progressed rapidly. It collapsed in sections due to neglect, and stones were then used as building material for other structures. It had become common practice for sections of the wall to be leased to burgesses (freemen of the town), which increased the rate of decline of the wall still further. Some of the wall was used to support the Glamorganshire Canal embankment. In 1890, one of the last surviving sections of the wall was photographed (image right) at the rear of an old infant school in The Hayes. In 1901, this section was demolished to make way for the Cardiff fish market, which is now 9-11 The Hayes. History of the gates It has been recorded that the town wall included six gates; north, west, south, Gulley or Golate, Blaunch and west. However, there is little evidence to indicate that Golate or Gulley Gate was a proper gate instead of just a breach in a section of the wall that had already been ruined by flooding. By the end of the 18th century, all the gates in Cardiff's town wall were demolished. From John Speed's plan of Cardiff in 1610, the Golate was not shown, therefore, it seems likely that Cardiff only ever had five proper town gates. Paul Sandby's original image of the North Gate The North Gate was also known as Senghennydd Gate or Sentry Gate. This was the main gate for travellers heading north to Senghennydd and Caerphilly. Its location spanned the present day Kingssway to the right of Cardiff Castle. It was illustrated several times by Paul Sandby between 1775 and 1776. Not long after Sandby's print was published in 1786, the North Gate was demolished to make room for the increasing traffic and the Glamorganshire Canal as recorded by Cardiff Council minutes 5 May 1786. The East Gate was known only by one name, Porth Crockerton (Crockerton Gate). The gate spanned Crockherbtown Street, now known as Queen Street, for travellers heading east to Llanrumney and Newport. It already stood when, in 1171, William Fitz Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the Lord of Glamorgan, mentioned it as the eastern boundary of the borough. It has been assumed that it may already have been a stone structure in 1171, while the rest of the walls were still made from wood. John Speed's 1610 plan (above) depicts the gate having a single arch, yet other accounts suggest that the gate may have had three arches. In a Cardiff Council meeting of 20 September 1791, it was decided that the East Gate should be demolished. The South Gate was mentioned in 1536 when John Leland referred to this gate as Portllongey, which means Shipsgate. Locally it was known as Moor Gate because it led to Soundry or South Town and onto moorlands, today known as Butetown. The only evidence of this gate comes from John Speed's plan and the indication of the location on later maps. The gate stood where today the Great Western Hotel stands. The final mention of the South Gate comes from a Cardiff Council meeting of 1802 when it was decided to demolish the gate and parts of the wall. There are no details known as to when Blaunch (or Blunch) Gate was actually built. It was not in the original palisade town wall in the 12th and 13th centuries. It seems likely that this gate was added when the town walls were rebuilt in the 15th century. In 1542, it was recorded as Blounts Yate, but before that it was known as Wales Gate. Later the name changed to Blaunch or Blounts Gate, named after the keeper of the gate. Nothing else is known about it. It is not shown on John Speed's plan or on a later drawing of 1678. It was later recorded in the Court of Bailiffs on 28 January 1785, that it was \\"Ordered that the gate near the Quay called the Blunch or Blount Gate be taken out\\" Paul Sandby's image of the West Gate The West Gate was also known as Millgate or Myllegate, although Rice Merrick () referred to the gate as Miskin Gate. The West Gate was first recorded in 1184, when it was still a timber building. A stone building replaced the timber construction and stood approximately high and 25 feet wide. The gate was demolished after 20 September 1781 according to Cardiff Council minutes. Cock's Tower, also known as Cokes Towre, and Cox's Tower, was a watchtower which stood on the east wall, on The Hayes. Some remains of it may still be traced. It stood on the bend of a moat, until about 1860, when it was demolished. Cock's Tower was situated on the site of St Davids shopping centre. When Oxford Arcade was demolished to make way for St Davids shopping centre, archaeologists tried to find remains of the town wall, as well as Cock's Tower, which was a medieval watchpost and dungeon until around the 16th century. Cock's Tower was demolished about 1860 and its foundations were destroyed in 1962. Present day The only remaining example of a Cardiff town gate is the reconstructed West Gate attached to Cardiff Castle reconstructed by the Bute family, which was constructed in 1860, on the approximate site of the old West Gate, this building is now a Grade II* listed building. It was restored in 1921, probably to its original size and dimensions. West Lodge Gate, which is the southern entrance to Bute Park, built in 1860 The largest remaining section of the town wall now stands in an alleyway behind Queen Street, approximately high, long with a width of . It previously had a blue plaque attached to it. A blue plaque of the North Gate still remains on the Northgate Building close by. Another smaller section of the wall supports a flower bed next to Cardiff Castle. Other connections with the town wall that still exist include the thoroughfares Westgate Street and Golate, plus the thoroughfare in St Davids shopping centre called the Town Wall and the Northgate Building, close to the original North Gate. St Davids shopping centre had been built on a boundary of the town wall. So when Oxford Arcade was demolished to make way for St Davids shopping centre, archaeologists tried to find remains of the town wall, as well as Cock's Tower, which was a medieval watchpost and dungeon until around the 16th century.

The objective of the ambush force is to quickly kill or capture all enemy soldiers inside the kill zone. The trapped soldiers may respond by counterattacking. The term is used in the analogous non-lethal sense in paintball and airsoft tactics. Practice Ambush The kill zone is an element of point ambush in which a military unit targets a single area with offensive fire such as mines, demolitions and section-level weapons. The kill zone may be bordered by obstacles, traps or indirect fire (artillery or mortars) to keep the enemy from escaping. In an area ambush, related multiple kill zones will be covered by multiple kill teams. The weapons of the kill team are not fired until the majority of the enemy unit is within the kill zone, ideally all of the targeted unit. Direct and effective fire is initiated by the kill team leader who orders simultaneous targeted firing by all members of the kill team. The attack is often initiated by remote-controlled charges such as Claymore mines or other explosives. The ambushed unit may be prevented from advancing or retreating by explosions at the front and rear of their column. Individual kill team members are to choose targets within the kill zone using machine gun and small arms fire but may be augmented by indirect fire. Ideally, the action is completed so quickly that the enemy force has no time to report the engagement. A successful ambush may result in a patrol in the kill zone being destroyed in seconds. The ambush of a kill zone carries high risk in that forces not in the zone may maneuver around the flanks of the attackers, limiting their escape. For this reason a properly executed ambush employs covering teams and relief teams in addition to the kill team(s). Nearby forces may also come to the assistance of those caught in the attack. Therefore, a well-executed attack may be over in under a minute and should rarely extend beyond a few minutes. Response A military unit that finds itself suddenly under fire in an enemy kill zone must immediately take action against the ambushers. Such action may include soldiers assuming a prone position to minimize themselves as targets. Prone soldiers will return fire toward the ambushers. Other responses may include the targeted soldiers immediately assaulting suspected defensive positions. Soldiers outside of the kill zone may direct suppressive fire at the ambushers in support of the assault, and they may advance upon the flanks of the ambushers. Vehicles in the kill zone will likely attempt to leave it, while vehicle gunners fire toward the ambushers. Disabled vehicles may create cover for ambushed soldiers. Soldiers able to leave their disabled vehicles are expected to join the assault against the ambushers. Site selection The kill zone should isolate and trap the enemy. The selection of a likely kill zone involves evaluating the terrain and making up for any inadequacies. First and foremost, the kill zone must be where the enemy is expected to travel, or where the enemy can be attracted with \\"bait\\". If the potential kill zone terrain restricts vehicle movement to one vehicle width at a time, then a suddenly disabled vehicle will help to isolate the enemy. Terrain that keeps the enemy from moving out of the kill zone is useful for isolation, otherwise the ambushers will wish to place obstacles or munitions at the borders of the selected area. Especially important is separation between the enemy and the ambushing units, to prevent a counterattack. Avoidance Military units on the move are vulnerable to ambush. To avoid the kill zone, a patrol may \\"fan out\\" and travel with elements spread out left and right, rather than staying solely on a road or track. Soldiers who take point must keep an eye out for signs of a kill zone, such as disturbed ground, obstacles and restrictive terrain. Night vision and thermal imaging equipment may help to discover hidden weapons, or enemy soldiers under cover. Paintball The term \\"kill zone\\" is used in paintball tactics to designate an area that is heavily defended by enemy paintball players. Advancing players may know the location of the potential kill zone but be uncertain whether it is well-defended. Responses vary to being caught in a paintball kill zone. If the kill zone is too large and the enemy forces relatively far away, the ambushed players often retreat to cover. If the kill zone is small, the ambushed players are likely to charge forward and assault the defensive players. Fellow players who are not caught in the kill zone are likely to attack the flanks of the defensive players.

In 1972, Mother Teresa visited Huntsville Abbey for a retreat with the monks, at the invitation of Brother Nicholas Prinster, one of the monks who had spent some time with her. He died in 2018. The monks of Utah were involved with the founding of a Trappistine monastery of nuns in Arizona. Over the years, many of the priests from Utah were sent to be the chaplain for Santa Rita Abbey. National Geographic produced a short video about the Trappist Monks of Holy Trinity Abbey. One of the notable monks at the abbey was former Abbot Casimir Bernas OCSO, who wrote almost 400 reviews of biblical and theological journals and textbooks. A former monk, Walter M. Miller Jr., wrote an fictional book based on the monastery in Utah, A Canticle for Leibowitz. Utah author Richard Crangle wrote another fictional work loosely based on the monks of the monastery, titled Temptations Behind Stained Glass: A Canticle of Desires and Redemptions.Temptations Behind Stained Glass: A Canticle of Desires and Redemptions A former Utah Trappist monk priest, George Fowler, wrote Dance of a fallen monk: a journey to spiritual enlightenment about his 20 years at the monastery, before he eventually left the Catholic Church to marry a former nun. Father Charles Cummings, OCSO was an editor of Cistercian Studies Quarterly. He was also the author of monastic books, including Spirituality and the desert experience; Eco-spirituality : toward a reverent life; Songs of freedom: the psalter as a school of prayer; and two editions of Monastic Practices. The monks supported themselves by farming and beekeeping on the abbey's 1,840 acres of land. Among other goods, they sold bread, multigrain cereal, creamed honey, and handmade clocks in the gift shop. The abbey had 32 monks when it was founded, and at one point it held 84 monks and novices. As the number of monks at the abbey dwindled and the average age among those remaining increased, its industries were gradually discontinued. The decision was made to sell and close down the abbey. On August 27, 2017, the abbey celebrated its final mass and was closed afterward.https://vimeo.com/236672432 Two monks transferred their vow of stability to Genesee Abbey, another Trappist abbey in New York. One monk, Father Charles Cummings, OCSO became the chaplain at Our Lady of Angels monastery for the Trappist nuns in Crozet, Virginia. He died in 2020 while transferring his vow of stability to the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, CA. The remaining monks moved to a nursing home in Salt Lake City. The influence of the monks on their neighbors in the valley was documented in a commentary printed in the Ogden, Utah newspaper. In 2018, a documentary film, book and poster by John Slattery, cinematographer and director, titled PRESENT TIME: Journal of a Country Monastery, were crowdfunded to document the 70-year history of the abbey.https://www.seedandspark.com/fund/present-time-journal- of-a-country-monastery#story Brother David McManus, OCSO was the last librarian for the monks. He died in 2019. Father David Altman and Father Patrick Boyle were interviewed by the local diocesan newspaper as they reviewed the finished limited edition of the book that has been released in advance of the DVD Present Time. Father David Altman was again interviewed by the Intermountain Catholic about the \\"stay-at-home-order\\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic being similar to having the entire world to adjust to certain monastic ways.

The Ashes urn is a small urn made of terracotta and standing 10.5 cm high Lords Cricket Ground Museum, believed to contain the ashes of a burnt cricket bail. It was presented to Ivo Bligh, the captain of the England cricket team, as a personal gift after a friendly match hosted at Rupertswood mansion in Sunbury during the 1882–83 tour in Australia. After his death the urn was presented to the Marylebone Cricket Club, which has it on display at Lord's cricket ground in London. The urn has come to be strongly associated with 'The Ashes', the prize for which England and Australia are said to compete in Test series between the two countries. The origin of the urn The death notice that appeared in The Sporting Times An etching of the English cricket team that toured Australia in 1882-83 in the Australasian newspaper of 1882. The English Cricket Team that toured Australia in 1882-83. They were captained by Ivo Bligh.

On 29 August 1882 Australia defeated England in a cricket match played at Kennington Oval, London. There was a great deal of dismay felt by the English about this loss and a few days later a mock obituary notice written by Reginald Shirley Brooks appeared in the Sporting Times which read: \\"In Affectionate Remembrance of English Cricket which died at the Oval on 29th August, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. R.I.P. N.B.—The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\\"The Sporting Times, 31 August 1882. It was the first time the term 'the ashes' had been mentioned. It had previously been arranged that a cricket team captained by Ivo Bligh would tour Australia in 1882-83 and this team became the English hope of victory. Before leaving England for Australia, Bligh pledged to bring back \\"The Ashes of English cricket\\".Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 \\"In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes\\". page 19. Three main Test matches were played. The first was in Melbourne and was won by Australia. The second was also in Melbourne and won by the English. The third match was in Sydney and was again won by the English. After this it was generally acknowledged that the English were the victors. After the conclusion of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets.The International Cricket Match. England v. United Australia The Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1883, p. 10, at Trove This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test.Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 \\"In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes\\". pages 24-27 However, The Sydney Morning Herald made it very clear that this game was not part of the international \\"rubber\\" which had in fact been won by England.Cricket. The International Matches The Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1883, p. 11, at Trove There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour. The urn was made during the 1882-83 tour. It is a very small red terracotta artefact which some believe could be a perfume bottle. Two labels are pasted on it: the top label says \\"The Ashes\\"; the lower label is a verse cut out from Melbourne Punch magazine of 1 February 1883 which reads: :\\"When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn; :Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return; :The welkin will ring loud, :The great crowd will feel proud, :Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn; :And the rest coming home with the urn.\\" These names are some of the men in the English team. Many of them are shown in the pictures above. There is also an associated red velvet bag with a Victor's Olive Crown embroidered on it in yellow silk cotton with the emblem “1883” in the middle of it. This bag was made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, wife of the manager of the NSW team, in early 1883.Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 75. The presentation of the urn Janet, Lady Clarke, was one of the women who presented the urn to Bligh. Rupertswood, where the Ashes urn originated Florence Morphy (later Lady Darnley) who also presented the Ashes urn to Bligh. Ivo Bligh (later Lord Darnley) who was the recipient of the Ashes urn. Reports have established that the estate of Rupertswood in Sunbury, Victoria is the birthplace of the Ashes urn legend. According to a 1908 newspaper report in the Hobart Mercury, an unnamed writer from the Westminster Gazette recalled that a group of Melbourne ladies which included Janet, Lady Clarke, and Florence Morphy, presented \\"a tiny silver urn, containing what they termed 'the ashes of Australian (sic) cricket.'\\"Cricket Hobart Mercury, 4 June 1908, p.8, at Trove to The Hon. Ivo Bligh, captain of the English touring team after one of the three Tests in 1882-83. Rupertswood was the home of Sir William Clarke and Janet, Lady Clarke. Sir William was president of the Melbourne Cricket Club. At Christmas 1882 and again at Easter 1883, the members of the English cricket team were his guests.Munns, Joy 1994 \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes\\", pages 16-17. A divergent story about the presentation of the urn is that on Christmas Eve, prior to the start of the three-test series, and after a friendly match between the English cricketers and a combination of staff and guests held at Rupertswood, the urn was presented by Lady Clarke to Bligh in a joking fashion.Munns, Joy 1994 \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes\\", page 17 Also present on this occasion was the Clarkes' music teacher, Florence Morphy, who was later to marry Ivo Bligh. There has been some disagreement with this version of events mainly because of three issues. Firstly the verse on the urn was not published in Punch until 1 February 1883 which is five weeks after the Christmas event. Secondly there are statements by both Lord Darnley and Lady Darnley that the presentation happened sometime after the Third Test.Lord Darnley’s statement is in Cricket Field, 30 June 1894. Lady Darnley’s statement was given to Lady Mildred Allsop and quoted in Munns, Joy 1994 \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes\\", page 62 The Third Test finished in Sydney on 30 January 1883. Thirdly the accompanying red velvet bag made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, was not made until early 1883. Joy Munns has taken these problems into account and has concluded that there were two quite separate presentations of the same urn. It was presented firstly at Rupertswood at Christmas and was merely the perpetuation of a joke. The second and most documented event was at Easter (which was around 25 March 1883) at Rupertswood after all the formal matches had finished. On this occasion Joy Munns says the verse was pasted on the urn, it was placed in the red velvet bag and given to Bligh.Munns, Joy 1994 \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes\\", page 65. Lady Clarke and Florence Morphy were both present on this occasion. This version of the presentation being in late March is supported by a statement made by Lord Darnley who said in 1921 that he was presented with the urn by \\"some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team\\".hall\\" urn&searchLimits;=l-decade=192 International Cricket: The Ashes Geraldton Guardian, 15 February 1921, page 1, at Trove England in fact won the series 2-1.

Over Easter many of the English team were guests at Rupertswood and did not embark on the return voyage to England until 29 March. Ivo Bligh stayed for another five weeks during which time it is believed he became engaged to Florence Morphy. He sailed for England on 5 May but returned to Australia in February 1884. Four days after his arrival, on 9 February,Summary of Events The Illustrated Australian News, 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at Trove he married Florence at St Mary's Church in Sunbury.Marriage of the Hon.

A modern-day replica of the Ashes Urn After their honeymoon in Australia the couple went to England in August 1884 where they stayed at Cobham Hall in Kent. The English papers reported that Florence was warmly welcomed by the Bligh family on her arrival. They remained in England for the next 18 months and then returned to Melbourne in January 1886. It was reported at this time that they intended to stay in Australia for about one year because of Ivo Bligh's health. In Melbourne they lived in a house called Hazelwell in Powlett St East Melbourne and in November 1886 Florence had her first child.

The Ashes urn remained at the Hall until Bligh's death in 1927. Lord Darnley had an interview in 1921 with Montague Grover, a well-known Australian journalist, at his home in Cobham Hall. Grover says that the urn was kept in Darnley's den where all his other treasured cricket memorabilia were placed. He had numerous photos of the other team players on the wall as well as a leather-bound copy of the original account of the 1882-83 cricket tour of Australia.Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1.

It was placed in the Long Room at the Lord's Pavilion until 1953, when it was transferred to the Cricket Museum next to the Pavilion. A photo of the urn in the Long Room in 1929 is shown at the left. After the urn was first displayed at Lord's it produced a gradual change in the public perception of 'The Ashes'. In 1933 it was displayed in the National Sporting Trophies Exhibition in London with some of the world's great sporting memorabilia. To the public the urn was becoming the image and symbol of 'The Ashes'.Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 \\"In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes\\". page 82. It was not until after about 1950 that the cricket books and paraphernalia almost exclusively used representation of the urn to depict 'The Ashes'. From about 1989 images of the Australian Test cricketers with replicas of the urn appeared in the media. Since 1929 the urn has returned to Australia only thrice – once when it was brought to Sydney for the Bicentenary Test Match in 1988 and secondly in 2006 for the tour of the Ashes Exhibition to each state capital of Australia.Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 \\"In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes\\". page 35.

By then, Keator had left his legal practice and had become a minister, as well as the first-priest-in-charge of the new mission. He remained at the parish until 1896, when he accepted a call from a church in Iowa, near his childhood home, and soon become the first Bishop of the Missionary diocese of Olympia, Washington.http://www.churchoftheatonement.org/history In May 1898 the Mission became a self-supporting Parish and had 120 members, and construction of the Parish House began south of the church. The Parish House was finished in 1901. By the early 20th century, the parish had become of the leading Anglo-Catholic parishes in the country. Beginning under Rector Charles E. Deuel (1903-1914) in 1910, the original church building was enlarged to twice its capacity, since by then the parish had more than 500 members. This expansion and the 1919 expansion were under the guidance of British born parishioner J.E.O. Pridmore, who carefully maintained the English Gothic church style.J.E.O. Pridmore, Edgewater Architect Vol. IV No. 3 - FALL/WINTER 1992 by LeRoy Blommaert The first service after the last expansion was on Easter in 1920. The parish then had 650 members, and Rector Frederick Fleming (who served from 1915-1927) would represent the Diocese of Chicago at several Anglo-Catholic conferences. Rev. Fleming would leave this parish to accept a call as rector of St. Stephen's Church in Providence, Rhode Island in 1927, and finished his career as rector of historic Holy Trinity Church in Manhattan, New York City. Meanwhile, in 1922 a new Parish House was begun and completed in 1924. Stained glass windows were added beginning in 1929, under Rector Alfred Newberry (1927-1937; who would ultimately leave to accept a call from the Church of the Advent in Boston) and finished in 1946. Under Rector Dean Paxton Rice, the church received a donation of an Elizabethan-era paneled room (installed in the Parish House), and also expanded its outreach to the diverse and changing neighborhood. It established St. Augustine's Mission to the Native American community in the nearby Uptown neighborhood. In the 1970s, the church established a ministry to Spanish-speaking neighbors. The parish also developed a distinguished music program, including a choir which expanded under Rev. Thomas Harris to include women, and a custom-built organ. Architecture Parishioner Henry Ives Cobb designed the original church building, including a stone tower on the northwest corner and constructing the east wall of wood to facilitate future expansion. Cobb was known for his English Gothic and Richardson Romanesque buildings, including the Potter Palmer Mansion, the Newberry Library and the Old Chicago Historical Society on Dearborn and Ontario Streets (now a nightclub). He also designed the Fisher Building. Pridmore's expansion, finished during World War I, created the current church. The roof was raised and extended 16 feet, to Kenmore Avenue, and side aisles added. Stained glass windows were added, with the final one installed at the end of World War II, and after Pridmore's death. The best example of the stained glass is the Christ the King window in the North Chapel. It has been recognized in books on stained glass in Chicago as one of the best. On the second level of the Parish House, is the Elizabethan Room. It was brought to the United States from England in 1620. The paneling is registered with The Art Institute of Chicago and is the only authentic example of its kind in the Midwest.

Charity The Tiny Tickers charity was founded in 1999 by a group of parents and medical professionals who had experience of, and were concerned about, the low prenatal detection rate of congenital heart defects(CHD). At that time, the published detection rate for CHD was 23% on average across the UK, with wide geographic variation (Bull K., Lancet, 1999). Tiny Tickers aims to provide a better START for tiny hearts, through five key areas: * Standards - to improve standards of care, using appropriately trained and qualified resources * Training - to improve screening for CHD in hospitals, especially at the routine ultrasound anomaly scan * Awareness - to inform the public and health professionals about congenital heart disease * Research - to increase our understanding of prenatal congenital heart defects and the impact on quality of life * Together - working with charities, professionals, businesses and supporters to make this a reality Activities Tiny Tickers aims: * All women should be offered the opportunity to have their baby screened for heart problems during pregnancy * This screening examination should detect most types of congenital heart defect * There should be sufficient resources and trained specialists to care for babies with heart conditions and support families If these goals are met, more babies with heart conditions would have a prenatal diagnosis, allowing families and doctors to be involved at an earlier stage and give these babies the chance of a better start in life. Facts and figures In 2002 Tiny Tickers funded a free hands-on, on-site training programme and piloted it in 12 hospitals. Based on positive feedback from the pilot, the training was extended throughout the UK. In 2008, Tiny Tickers were asked to train all hospitals in Wales and in 2010, to train 3 regions in England. In 2011, Tiny Tickers trained over 80 hospitals in England and Wales bringing the total trained to over 140 (or about 2/3rds of maternity hospitals).

It was a light twin-engined craft intended for flight distance record setting. Design and development Fernic-FT-9 tandem monoplane built by Gheorghe Fernic Designer George Fernic was a Romanian aviator who developed the T-9 after emigrating to the United States from Germany. The Fernic T-9 can be seen as a conventional twin-engined monoplane with the addition of a nose-mounted canard foreplane to provide two lifting surfaces in tandem. The canard was designed to stall ahead of the main wing, reducing the risk of stalling or spinning the entire aircraft. The plywood covered aircraft also featured tricycle landing gear with a castering nose wheel. A spring steel tail skid was added to protect the tail. Fernic tested the design with professor Alexander Klemin in the wind tunnels of the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics, New York University in 1926. For the transatlantic effort, the upper engine nacelles were able to be removed and powered with a small outboard motor for water ditching. Operational history The T-9 was first flown at Roosevelt Field in New York on 10 September 1929. The landing gear and wings were damaged on its second day of test flying. A record flight from the United States to Bucharest, Romania was planned with the prototype. Fernic did not complete the flight due to a fatal accident he suffered while landing his later three-surface design, the Fernic FT-10 Cruisaire in 1930.

Located on both sides of Center Street between High and Liberty streets, the mall has 80 stores and a food court. Opened in 1979, the mall has three anchor stores with of gross leasable space located on and two floors. The anchors are: Kohl's and Macy's with two vacant anchors last occupied by JCPenney and Nordstrom. The mall also features five sky bridges, one of which connects Macy's to the mall, another connects the mall to an adjacent city-owned parking garage, with another connecting the former JCPenney to the mall, in addition to connecting the two mall buildings across Center Street. Salem Center is managed by Jones Lang Lasalle. Early history Salem Center's roots can be traced back to 1955, when Meier & Frank opened a two-level department store and parking garage, which was the first branch location in the chain. JCPenney also opened a two-level store nearby in 1965. While those two stores were originally designed as freestanding buildings, they eventually became integrated into the later mall development as anchor stores, and were connected to the mall via skybridges. Mall development history Construction began on the new shopping center in 1978. Salem Center then opened in 1979, and was remodeled in 1988 and again in 1995. Until approximately 2004 the mall was known as Salem Centre. The Kohl's location was previously a Mervyns store until 2007, while Macy's location is a converted Meier & Frank with the name change in 2006. The mall launched a service in January 2008 that allowed people to search all products offered by the mall's stores, claiming to be the first mall in Oregon to have such a service.

The church was founded in 1833 by workers building the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and first met in a rough log cabin. The present church building was built from 1853 to 1858 of locally quarried limestone painstakingly dragged up the steep hill. It was built on an ancient Native American trail, which has evolved into today's Archer Avenue (Illinois Route 171). On March 27, 1991, a tornado caused significant damage to Lemont and Sag Bridge, including the historic St. James church and cemetery. The tornado lifted up the roof of the church and dropped it back down askew, and knocked over numerous trees and tombstones in the cemetery. A group of dedicated parishioners banded together as the St. James Preservation Society to repair the damage and restore their church. St. James at Sag Bridge Catholic Church continues today in its historic role as the center of the Sag Bridge community. It is the only country parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 1984, and is a contributing property of the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor.

It is considered the finest example of Gothic Revival and Prairie School design in town. History The First Congregation Church of Western Springs in Illinois was founded in 1887. By the 1921, the congregation had expanded to a point where a new church building was required. In 1924, a Building and Planning Committee was formed out of the congregation to seek out an architect. Seven architects from Chicago and St. Louis were interviewed. The design submitted by George Grant Elmslie was selected as the winning bid in 1926. Elmslie had just ended a lengthy partnership with William Gray Purcell and had opened an independent practice in Chicago. The committee was fond of Elmslie's recent Capitol Building and Loan Association in Topeka, Kansas, and envisioned a similar structure.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223423.pdf The committee favored a Gothic Revival building, and Elmslie obliged by submitting an elaborate Gothic design. When the committee realized that the design would be too expansive, Elsmlie responded by offering a design with Prairie School elements. Construction finished in 1930 with the completion of the sanctuary and Education Building, both structures a blend of Gothic and Prairie styles. Gothic elements included a cruciform floor plan and stained glass windows from the Temple Art Glass Company of Chicago. Prairie elements include a horizontal emphasis, wood ornamentation, earth tones, and use of natural materials. Emil Zettler was commissioned to carve statues and provide decorative elements. Herbert and William Brand designed an addition north of the Education Building in 1959. The church was surveyed during the Illinois Historic Structures Survey and, on August 8, 2006, was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The annual camp meeting was established in 1860 by a group of Methodist ministers and businessmen, including the future war hero and Illinois Governor John L. Beveridge, on the scenic land of Squire Socrates Rand along the Des Plaines River. At the end of the US Civil War in 1865 approximately 25 equally scenic acres downstream (in what some deem to be the lowest geographical point in the midwest) were purchased from Squire Rand with donations. Upon these grounds the meetings have been held annually without interruption. The Chicago District Camp Ground Association was granted a charter in 1867 and continues to be led by an elected Board of Trustees. Chosen for the proximity to Chicago (about 16 miles), Squire Rand's properties bordered both a C&NW; train line and a popular road that served travelers from the college town of Evanston, IL, home to Northwestern University then and now, making it an ideal location to bring midwesterners together to express their Christian faith in the serenity of the outdoors. Each summer in the early years devout Methodists staked out the groves to create a tent city, including boardwalks with signposts. A large clearing served as the main sanctuary where a platform speaker's stand served as stage for the ministers and choirs. Upwards of 10,000 people filled the groves for the large meetings. A train depot was eventually built to add a stop to the train lines from Chicago to save people from the mile-long walk from downtown Des Plaines. The ticket booth still stands off Campground Road, which runs parallel to the CNW train line. By the mid 1860s, devoted participants had tired of pitching tents. They began building temporary cottages meant to stand for 5–10 years. Many still stand today. Most of the current 100 cottages were built between 1870 and 1930 in a uniform late Victorian architecture style as found on Martha's Vineyard. Several important meeting houses were built for the many ongoing gatherings. In 1903 the American Tabernacle was built based on the architectural principles of the Eiffel Tower, rendering it devoid of support pillars that might obstruct a view of the stage. Later named the Waldorf Tabernacle (after Bishop Ernest Lynn Waldorf), its circular shape mimics the original tents and other similar tabernacles built for similar Chautauqua meetings throughout the United States. Cottages built around the circle are among the oldest surviving. All cottages are built on paths that lead to at least one of the many tabernacles. In 1906 the current Wesley Tabernacle was built as the new Swedish Tabernacle. A small, round Norwegian Tabernacle that could be seen from Algonquin Road caved in from heavy snows in the late 1990s. In the early decades of camp meeting, groups of Swedes, Germans, Norwegians and other ethnicities still spoke the mother tongue, creating a mild segregation which faded with time and assimilation. Famous frequenters to the Camp Ground included D.L. Moody, Frances E. Willard, Billy Sunday, Mahalia Jackson and other Christian celebrities of local and international acclaim. Camp Meeting met uninterrupted from 1860 through the late 1900s, at which time the nature of camp meeting was renamed and reformatted. It still includes ongoing Sunday worship services and summer events. Residents continue to own and rent cottages during the months between May and October, with one cottage designated for a year-round caretaker. In the early years, minor floods came no more than every seven years in the spring, creating very little inconvenience to campers. Due to excessive urban build-up in the outlying swamp tributaries to the Des Plaines River, the camp is subject to more and more floods each year, rising to levels that put some two-story cottages underwater to the rafters. The camp was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Linnell was posthumously invested as a Commander of the United States Legion of Merit in recognition of his outstanding services in the Mediterranean theatre of operations from 29 February – 29 June 1944. The decoration was presented to his widow, Lady Linnell, by Brigadier General E. F. Koenig at a special ceremony in London. Project Upkeep Linnell was apparently against the idea of a bouncing bombRoyal Air Force Museum London Wing Commander Winterbotham's Letter reasoning that it was drawing development resources away from the prototype high altitude bomber Vickers Windsor, his thinking may have been influenced by Charles Craven, the Chairman at Vickers.New Scientist 2 March 1978 pages 563–564 Early in 1943, tests authorised by Linnell in June 1942 at the instigation of Sir Henry Tizard, indicated that a bouncing bomb was technically feasible. A meeting between the Air Ministry, RAF Bomber Command and MAP decided to continue development of project Upkeep with a proposal to have a fully trained squadron ready by May. AOC-in-C of RAF Bomber Command Harris thought differently and saw the project as a waste of precious Lancasters. However Chief of the Air Staff Portal was convinced by film footage of the tests and ordered three Lancasters allocated to the project. One week later, at a meeting convened by Linnell, the number of Lancasters ordered had risen to a squadron and Operation Chastise was planned for that spring.Dambusters – Operation Chastise 1943 by Douglas C.Dildy Personal life Only son of William Henry and Kate Linnell, he had one sister, Marjorie Clare.

Biography He belonged to a noble Belgian family, and his brother was prime minister of that kingdom for several years. Ferdinand entered the Society of Jesus in 1817, and at the close of his novitiate was appointed professor and prefect of studies in the high school of Brig, Switzerland. After several years, he was summoned to Rome to act as assistant secretary to the father general of the order, and subsequently was assigned to the American mission. Helias arrived in the United States, 19 May 1833, and was immediately appointed master of novices in the Jesuit college, Frederick, Maryland. Shortly afterward he organized at St. Louis, Missouri, a German congregation, which, through his labors, became one of the largest in the country. He also built St. Joseph's Church for the use of the German Catholics. In 1838 he organized the first German congregation outside of St. Louis at Washington, Franklin County, Missouri, and founded a church. From Washington he made his way through the wilderness, with compass in hand, to Westphalia, Osage County, where he organized a church and founded a mission. In course of time, he organized congregations and built churches in Rich Fountain in the same county, in St. Thomas and Jefferson City, in Taos, in Booneville, Cooper County, and in several other places. His missionary labors extended to Westport and Independence, the extreme western settlements of the state. For the last 24 years of his life, he was principally stationed at Taos, near Jefferson City. Notwithstanding his advanced age, he continued to perform his functions until the day before his death.

He has been a director of 60 companies. He was jailed in 2001 and 2003 for bribery and fraud. Business career Hinchliffe was the 2nd largest UK Renault new car dealer in the 1970s. After training to be an accountant, Hinchliffe worked in a Sheffield engineering company and a Trent Regional Health Authority. He switched to marketing at grocers Mars and computer systems company Memorex. Wilkes In 1984, Hinchliffe led a management buyout of the Sheffield department store chain Wades, then suffering a £2m deficit, from Asda with a £200,000 stake. After the sale the chain returned a £2m profit and was sold on for £20m to Waring & Gillow – the buyout team made £7.3m profit and he personally made £2.9m. Using the profits from that sale and other property deals, including Norwich Union's Sheffield building, he bought the Midlands engineering firm James Wilkes, among other things a beermat maker, and became chairman after profits rapidly increased. The company headquarters was moved to Beauchief Hall in Sheffield, a stately home with a disco in the basement. Another engineering firm, Petrocon, attempted a hostile takeover of Wilkes and highlighted what it said were Hinchliffe's excesses, but the takeover failed in 1992. In the early 1990s, the West Midlands fraud squad arrested Hinchliffe without charge when investigating another company, WB Industries, who he had had property dealings with. He left Wilkes, receiving £533,000 in severance pay; he received a further £131,000 from a computer services company Lynx Holdings when he was forced to resign his chairmanship of that firm by the board. After leaving Wilkes in 1992, he unsuccessfully took on several other companies in tennis court surfacing, soccer kits, and retail, including Shoesave, renamed to Echolake Properties, Bukta Sportswear, and surfacing company En-Tout-Cas, renamed to Boxgrey. Boxgrey collapsed in 1994, with shares being transferred to four British Virgin Islands companies just prior to the collapse. The DTI investigated all three company collapses. Other deals included buying Cooper Ludlam cutlery, Colibri lighters, French & Scott cosmetics, and property deals in Sheffield – including the Sheffield Royal Hospital site and the city centre Gateway Project. Up until being banned from being a company director until 2013 by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998 due to the En-Tout-Cas/Boxgrey collapse, Hinchliffe had been on the board of 60 companies. His wife was also a director of some of the companies. He was declared bankrupt in 2001. Facia group In August 1994 he sold his remaining stake in Wilkes to engineering group Suter Plc (now part of Dow) and received a £3m loan from John Doherty, chief lending officer of the London branch of United Mizrahi Bank, Israel's fourth largest bank. He used the money to buy Salisbury's, a chain selling leather goods, from Signet (formerly Ratners) for £3.18m (Ratner had paid 25 times that six years earlier). The purchase was also backed by Murray Johnstone, a fund management company. This deal was the founding of Hinchliffe's Facia group. His personal company to manage his own finances was Chase Montagu, which was paid fees by Facia.UK: HIGH STREET STITCH-UP. – Leadership, business and management news, tips and features from MT and Management Today magazine Hinchliffe's Facia group, with its headquarters at Parkhead Hall in Sheffield, rapidly became a retail empire with 850 British high street shops (more than Marks and Spencer at the time), over 6000 employees, and over £250m in turnover, second only to Littlewoods as a private retail group in the United Kingdom. Brands acquired at the pace of around one a month included clothing stores Sock Shop, Red or Dead, Contessa, and Oakland menswear, Torq jewellers, and the shoe shops Trueform, Saxone, Manfield, and Freeman Hardy and Willis, though only fashion chain Red or Dead was profitable.UK: WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT STEPHEN? – Leadership, business and management news, tips and features from MT and Management Today magazine Facia expanded into continental Europe in March 1996 when they acquired the German Bata Shoes chain and renamed it Millennium. Hinchliffe's strategy was said to be buying well-known but apparently underperforming brand names, centralise warehouses and distribution, and upgrade stores, but also involved delaying payments to suppliers and channelling money to his private company. The group was partly sustained by shell companies that Hinchliffe used to borrow money. Facia bought the shoe shops from Sears, but only paid for the brand names, shelves and tills – in an unusual deal, Sears retained the leases, staff and stock. Murray Johnstone had sold Sock Shop to Hinchliffe and owned 50% of Facia. Rival companies and marketing analysts expressed scepticism over the rapid expansion, the merits of the business strategy in a difficult trading environment for high street brands versus out-of-town stores, the lack of coherence of the brands, and the lack of transparency over accounts and funding sources. Management Today said he was \\"Like someone playing Monopoly and buying whichever property they land on\\". A new headquarters was being built in Chelsea in 1996 where Laura Ashley's design HQ used to be, including a \\"high street\\" of all the Facia branches. He bought Knoydart estate, west Highlands from Sheffield United chairman Reg Brealey's Titaghur company in 1998, with Christopher Harrison, the finance director of Facia. In May 1999 he was bought out by the local community for £850,000, leaving him with £1.4m debt.Community thriving with boost in population and economy growing Herald Scotland Collapse and trials Facia group did not file accounts in 1996 and attempted to change the terms of the rental agreement on the shops. United Mizrahi Bank decided to withdraw from lending, auditors including Deloitte and Touche declined to sign off the 1994/5 accounts for Sock Shop and Salisbury's, and the former owners and leasers of Saxone, Sears withdrew support. Hinchliffe tried to arrange a sale to Texas American Group, who later sued Facia for giving them misleading figures, but the group collapsed in June 1996, owing £70m, and was brought into receivership by KPMG and Grant Thornton. In December 1996 the Serious Fraud Office began an investigation. Hinchliffe was charged with fraud in December 1998. A trial at the Old Bailey concluded that Hinchliffe paid £813,750 in 'gifts' to Doherty to obtain £13m of unsecured loans. Doherty and Hinchliffe were both jailed by Judge Graham Boal for five years in February 2001. Paul Brady of United Mizrahi and businessman Robert Leckie were also jailed. Financial director Christopher Harrison was sentenced in February 2000 for misappropriation of funds relating to Bata. Hinchliffe served two years of his sentence, which had been reduced to four years on appeal, and was released on probation in January 2003. He and associate Christopher Harrison were subsequently convicted by Judge Jeremy Roberts in April 2003 of fraud associated with Facia's invoices. Hinchliffe served a further 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to the £1.75m fraud, increased from a non-custodial 15-month suspended sentence in July 2003 after an appeal by the SFO and the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith.Stephen Hinchliffe Press room SFO – Serious Fraud Office Twenty additional charges were dropped to save trial costs of up to £10m. He was released from jail in 2005. Football He owned 15% of Sheffield United football club and was on the board of directors; he attempted to become chairman but resigned in 1996 when Facia collapsed. He owned 37% of Hull City football club, controlling the club with Nick Buchanan and acting as vice-president. His involvement was investigated by the FA.When Saturday Comes – The Half Decent Football Magazine – Hull City, Hastings Town Hoyland Fox Hinchliffe was brought in by the Smith family, owners of Alexander Seven Marketing, to buy Hoyland Fox, a Goldthorpe-based umbrella company. He arranged the purchase by his wife's firm Mozaic in June 2007 using a loan from Hoyland Fox to Mozaic – a practice called \\"whitewashing.\\" The Smiths said they believed the purchase was on their behalf, but Hinchliffe later claimed that the agreement had been a 50:50 share in ownership between the two families. The Hinchliffes tried to gain control over Hoyland Fox in early 2008 due to what they said were disputed expenses and false invoices, but the Smiths put the company into receivership by withdrawing funds. In March 2010, Hinchliffe and his wife were found guilty by Judge Hazel Marshall in the Chancery Division of the High Court of \\"conspiring with intent\\" to take over the company when acting as agents for the Smith family. Benefit fraud In July 2015, Hinchliffe pleaded guilty at Sheffield Magistrates Court to overclaiming £4,228.89 in pension credits during 2012 and 2013. Personal life Hinchliffe was born in Sheffield and is the son of a civil servant or a postal clerk. He is married to Marjorie. He studied at New College, Oxford, leaving early to become an accountant. He is said to be imposing at 6' 5\\". Prior to being jailed in 2001, Hinchliffe lived in a villa, Long Acres, in Dore, Sheffield, collecting over 50 classic cars, driving a Mercedes with number plate SH1, and buying the former helicopter of Gerald Ratner to use to fly to meetings. The villa and four cottages owned by the couple was put up for sale in August 2002 by the receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers to pay personal creditors. After being released in 2005 he lived in a £1.5m mansion owned by his wife in Hope, Derbyshire. In 2015, he was living in Greenhill, Sheffield.

Since GRBs can occur anywhere in the sky, are often poorly localized, and fade very quickly, this implies very rapid slewing (less than 10 sec) and a wide field of view (greater than 15 degrees). To achieve the needed response time, LOTIS was fully automated and connected via Internet socket to the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This network analyzes telemetry from satellite such as HETE-2 and Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission and delivers GRB coordinate information in real-time.. The optics were built from 4 commercial tele-photo lenses of 11 cm aperture, with custom 2048 X 2048 CCD cameras, and could view a 17.6 X 17.6 degree field. LOTIS started routine operation in October 1996, with a limiting magnitude Mv≈11.5 . In March 1998 it was upgraded with cooled cameras, resulting in a limiting sensitivity of Mv≈14. It was in operation until at least 2001, but never successfully detected the optical counterpart of a GRB, though it did set upper limits. By 2001, the 4 cameras had been co- aligned and two of them had added filters. In the idle time between GRB triggers, LOTIS systematically surveyed the entire available sky every night for new optical transients. LOTIS was succeeded by another robotic telescope with a larger mirror but smaller field of view, called Super-LOTIS.

History INS Virbahu was commissioned as the shore support base for submarines on 19 May 1971. With the commissioning of INS Virbahu the 8th Submarine Squadron of Vela (Foxtrot) class submarines was based here. The Commanding Officer INS Virbahu was also designated as the Captain submarines 8th Submarine Squadron. Thereafter, with the induction of the Sindhughosh class submarines, the 11th Submarine Squadron was created. As two Submarine Squadrons were based at Visakhapatnam, comprising eight submarines, the scope of responsibility of the Commanding Officer, INS Virbahu, increased many fold. The submarines were thus placed under the operational control of Captain Submarines, 8th and 11th Submarine Squadron. With the increase of the number and type of submarines the operational authority of Submarine Squadrons was elevated from Captain Submarines to Commodore Submarines in Apr 1990. Since the appointment of the Commodore Submarines had a command responsibility towards the submarines the appointment was thus re-christened as Commodore Commanding Submarines (East Coast) in Jun 1997. Initially all training, maintenance, operational and logistic matters pertaining to submarines were dealt by Virbahu. As the Arm expanded, the training role was taken over by INS Satavahana and the Class Authority functions by Submarine Headquarters. But the attachment to the old Alma Mater persists and Virbahu continues to be regarded as the 'Home of the Dolphins' even today.

Led by Chief Kancamagus, it began King William's War, a series of Indian massacres orchestrated by Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin and Father Louis-Pierre Thury.  Cause  At the end of King Philip's War (1675-1678), a number of Indians fleeing the Massachusetts Bay Colony militia took refuge with the Abenaki tribe living in Dover. The militia ordered Major Richard Waldron to attack the natives and turn refugee combatants over to them. Waldron believed he could capture them without a pitched battle, and so on September 7, 1676, invited the natives—about 400 in total, half local and half refugees—to participate in a mock battle against the militia near Cochecho Falls. After the natives discharged their guns, Waldron and Major Charles Frost took them prisoner. He sent both refugee combatants and those locals who violently objected to Boston, where seven or eight were convicted of insurrection and executed. The rest were sold into slavery, most in Barbados. Local Indians were released, but never forgave Waldron for the deception, which violated both sides' rules of honor and hospitality. Waldron was appointed Chief Justice for New Hampshire in 1683.  Revenge  Death of Major Richard Waldron Thirteen years passed and settlers believed the incident forgotten, when members of the newly formed Wabanaki Confederacy arrived at Dover. Citizens expressed concern to Waldron, but he told them to \\"go and plant your pumpkins, and he would take care of the Indians.\\" On June 27, 1689, two native women appeared at each of five garrison houses, asking permission to sleep by the fire, not uncommon in peaceful times. All but one house accepted. In the dark early hours of the next day, the women unfastened the doors, allowing braves who had concealed themselves to enter.

Archaeological remains 20% of the wreck was recovered and lifted from the Thames Estuary, excavated and recovered by Wessex Archaeology. It was then taken to Horsea Island, an estuarine lake near Portsmouth so it could be preserved. A five- year research project (\\"The Gresham Ship Project\\"), was carried out from 2007 to 2012 by researchers from University College London and the University of Southern Denmark. The project focused on five large sections of the hull that had been recovered, as well as associated artefacts. The hull timbers are now a major exhibit at the UK National Dive Centre at Stoney Cove. The design and construction of the Princes Channel Wreck is of Archaeological significance, as it appears to have been rebuilt using the method of furring, which allowed the vessel to gain about 1 foot in width on each side. The rebuilding may have been necessary if the ship was crank-sided. Naming There has been debate as to the preliminary naming of the wreck, as it was found in the Princes Channel at the mouth of the Thames estuary. However the more popular name of Gresham Ship was introduced when the guns on board the vessel revealed a grasshopper insignia, which was the motif made by Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange.

Works Ward authored eight books during her lifetime, the most noted being The Snake Pit, which received widespread critical acclaim after its publication in 1946. Ward's semi- autobiographical story about a woman's recovery from mental illness made more than a hundred thousand dollars in its first month; it was quickly chosen for Random House’s book-of-the-month club and developed into an Oscar-winning film The Snake Pit, starring Olivia de Havilland.Yaël Ksander, Moment of Indiana History: Mary Jane Ward, March 24, 2008. Ward’s story, along with the ensuing film, was credited with instigating public dialogue on the condition of state psychiatric hospitals and influencing reform legislation. Three years after the book’s release, Daily Variety journalist Herb Stein wrote that Wisconsin had become “the seventh state to institute reforms in its mental hospitals as a result of The Snake Pit.”Clooney, Nick (November 2002). The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen. New York: Atria Books, a trademark of Simon & Schuster. p. 143. . Biography Mary Jane Ward was born August 27, 1905 in Fairmount, Indiana. Ward—cousin of Ross Lockridge, Jr.—maintained an interest in writing and music from an early age; as a teenager, she composed her own music, but would eventually choose writing as her main focus. After graduating from high school, Ward studied at Northwestern University and at Chicago's Lyceum of Arts Conservatory, and went on to work at a series of odd jobs. In March 1928, she married Edward Quayle, a statistician and amateur playwright, and became inspired to submit her own writing for publication. Ward published a few short stories, and in 1937 she received a job as a book reviewer for the Evanston News-Index. That same year, E. P. Dutton published Ward's novel The Tree Has Roots. A second novel, The Wax Apple, was published in 1938. Both books received decent reviews but did not achieve much popularity.Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Mugar Library, Boston University; Mary Jane Ward biography. Ward and Quayle moved to Greenwich Village in 1939. Neither of them was very successful in publishing their material, and the financial stress eventually proved to be too much for Ward, who suffered a nervous breakdown and ended up spending more than eight months at Rockland State Hospital in Orangeburg, New York. Ward was (probably erroneously) diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her therapy included scalding baths and electroshock. Over the next few years, drawing from her experiences at the psychiatric institution, Ward penned the novel The Snake Pit. The book was published in 1946 and received glowing reviews from critics and from experts in the psychiatric field. At the time The Snake Pit was released, Ward denied that the story reflected in any way on her own life, but it was later revealed that the book had been formed around her experiences at Rockland. The kindly character “Dr. Kik” is apparently based on Gerard Chrzanowski, who treated Ward at Rockland and was one of the first doctors in the U.S. to use psychoanalysis to treat patients with schizophrenia. Dr. Militades Zaphiropoulos, who also worked at Rockland while Ward was being treated there, stated in an interview that Chrzanowski was nicknamed “Dr. Kik” because Americans tended to have difficulty pronouncing his name.New York Times obituary for Gerard Chrzanowski, November 12, 2000. After the success of The Snake Pit, Ward and Quayle moved to a dairy farm outside of Chicago, where Ward continued to write. She went on to publish The Professor’s Umbrella (1948), A Little Night Music (1951), It’s Different for a Woman (1952), Counterclockwise (1969), and The Other Caroline (1970). Ward was hospitalized for psychiatric issues three more times during her lifetime, and her last two novels revisit the theme of psychiatric illness. She died on February 17, 1981, in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 75.

The Congress of Durrës () was a conference of Albanian political leaders, held from December 25 to December 27, 1918, in Durrës, at the time capital of the Principality of Albania. Mehmet Konica was the Chairman of the Congress, which aimed at establishing an Albanian National Council or Government under the influence of Italian authorities. It elected a government which fell in January 1920 after the Congress of Lushnjë.  Background  The efforts to form an Albanian government had begun with the start of the First World War, after the departure of Prince Wied and his government. Albanians have ceased efforts during the global conflict, but despite all later attempts, they had encountered strong opposition from the occupying armies. The chances of forming an Albanian government became higher by the end of the First World War, when the Albanians were constrained to harmonize all efforts to avoid real threats coming from the war-winning neighbors. These threats were being institutionalized through the Paris Peace Conference. Following the events carefully, Albanians found themselves before a very important international event, which required political maturity and restraint. The government in exile, represented by Essad Toptani, had made itself a sufficient publicity through European newspapers. Not only his political profile was not damaged, but rather it was given a place of honor as the \\"first Albanian diplomat in the eyes of European diplomacy\\". These were some of the circumstances which had driven Vatra, as published later through the newspaper \\"The Sun\\" (), to demand to the Italian government to respect the will of all Albanians, allowing them to form in Albania a government of their own. This was in August 1918, while World War I was not still over. A similar request to the Italian side came also Myfid Libohova, who in October demanded to the Italians the establishment of a provisional government, which would work side by side with the Italian counterpart in \\"fighting against common enemies\\".  Preparations  By the end of World War I, the Italians needed an Albanian government composed of pro-Italian elements. This required, first to create the impression that Albanians demanded a government brought to life with the support of Italy, and second, an official government body established legally, which would be the best option to avoid any other representatives of Albania (claimants) which might show up and be introduced at the Peace Conference. This government would server as a domestic support, but also to avoid any territorial claims from the Balkan neighbors. Sonnino called Turhan Pasha, Myfid Libohova, and Mihal Turtulli for a summon in Rome on October 22, 1918. They should make contact with the Albanian colonies, and form an interim government where the large Albanian provinces as well as all religions were represented. Turhan Pasha and Myfid Libohova resided still in Italy during early November, while the Albanian newspaper \\"The Nation\\" () was presenting them as \\"patriots and people with a spotless past\\". Mihal Turtulli had the mandate of Vatra but was still residing in Switzerland. He didn't go to Italy as requested initially, evaluating the danger of Italy's colonialist intentions, but did not succeed to find any support within Albania. Italians managed to replace Turtulli with another delegate from Vatra, which was Mehmet Konica. Konica was called to go to Rome on November 3–4, 1918. Gathering of Albanian leaders had already started by October 1918, with the support of Mehdi Frashëri and Mustafa Kruja, both pro-Italian at that time. The same were asking Vatra on October 6, 1918 to send the representatives in Italy for discussing the ground of a common political platform, which would be represented at the Peace Conference. Mehmet Konica, according to \\"Kombi\\", arrived in Rome on November 19, warmly received by the Italian side. Meanwhile, the Italian government had given up the initial idea of assembling an Albanian government. Albanians leaders, who came from Rome to Albania, were advised to form only a \\"National Council\\" or \\"National Committee\\" rather than a government. This half-government should not exercise independent politics, neither internally nor internationally, and would depend a lot on Italian decision making. All this was ostensibly made to avoid any diplomatic entanglement. In late November 1918, the approval of forming the Albanian National Council arrived. The council was pre-designed by Gaetano Manconi and was supposed to be formed as soon as possible in Durrës. Regardless of the factual substantial form, either as a government or as a council, this governing body should come after a national congress. Mehmet Konica, Myfid Libohova, and Mehdi Frashëri were launched in Albania in late December 1918, accompanied by Lieutenant Ettore Lodi, who would perform political tasks during the congress as well as later. The preparation stage for a Congress in Durrës was accompanied by an initiative to gather a congress or meeting in Shkodra. The later idea came impossible due to objections of French Colonel Bardy De Fourtou, and the meeting took place in Lezhë on December 9, 1918, being organized by Catholic clerics and tribal chieftain of Mirdita, Prênk Bibë Doda, but this movement found no support on other Albanian regions because of its emphasized \\"Northern Albanian\\" character.  Congress of Tirana  The preparation took place with the initiative of Rauf Fico (vice- prefect) and Abdi Toptani on a meeting held on December 7 at Fico's office. Other initiators were Sotir Peçi, Abdyl Ypi, Ismail Ndroqi, Mytesim Kelliçi, Sinan Hoxha, and Myslim Beshiri. An invitation was sent to representatives of central regions, with a special invitation for Hasan Prishtina, Aqif Pashë Elbasani, and Ahmet Zogu who were invited to come earlier. The Congress of Tirana was held on 19–20 December, which was attended this time only by representatives of several provinces of central Albania led by Abdi Toptani and Ismail Ndroqi, with the aim of establishing the grounds of a National Congress (initially was thought to be held in Krujë in January 1919) which would be achieved later in Durrës.  Events  The congress was opened on the afternoon of 25 December 1918, with the participation of 53 delegates. They came from most Albanian regions, which were under Italian occupation. The delegates from Vlora were not allowed following strict instructions received from Rome. Congress lacked also the representatives of the provinces that were under Serb occupation, Peshkopi, and Has-Luma, and even those who were under French occupation, as the Korçë area. Delegates by region: *Gjirokastër - Myfit Bey Libohova, Polo Meksi, Petro Poga, Apostol Dhima, Vasil Dilo *Delvinë - Namik Bey Delvina, Hikmet Bey Delvina *Tepelenë - Sylejman Shehu, Koço Harito *Përmet - Baba Xhemali, Dhimitër Kacimbra *Dishnicë & Këlcyrë - Baba Mustafa, Baba Hyseni *Frashër - Rexhep Selfo *Kurvelesh - Ali Koka *Kolonjë - Abdullah Bey, Petër Prodani *Berat - Sami Bey Vrioni, Dhimitër Tutulani, Fejzi Bey Alizoti *Mallakastër - Hajredin Cakrani, Kamber Belishova *Lushnje - Ahmet Resuli, Jakov Bozo *Skrapar - Xhelal Bey Koprencka, Servet Bey Zaloshnja *Elbasan - Shefqet Bey Vërlaci, Lef Nosi, Ahmet Dakli *Peqin - Ismail Haki Kadiu, Xhavit Metobashi *Durrës - Hafiz Aliu, Mihal Truja, Mustafa Kruja *Kavajë - Qazim Bey Hyti (Elbasani), Sheh Hamiti *Krujë - Muharrem Pengili, Xhemal Belegu *Shijak - Ymer Bey Shijaku, Rexhep Jella *Tiranë - Adbi Bey Toptani (did not attend), Ismail Efendy Ndroqi *Mat - Abdurrahman Bey Çela, Hasan Bey Zogolli *Shkodër - Riza Dani, Ndoc Çoba, Luigj Gurakuqi (instead of Preng Bibe Doda) In addition to the delegates' list, there were other political figures present in Durrës. The local newspaper Agimi (\\"The Dawn\\") would redirect to this issue in detail in Mars 1921 (vol.54, p. 155): \\"During the congress, persons that lacked the delegate mandate managed to get the right of speech and proposals.\\" Prior to discussing the agenda, the representatives of Durrës expressed concern about the lack of participation from all the provinces of Albania. The secretary of the congress on behalf of the Assembly expressed the despair of Assembly regarding the absence of representatives of Vlora, Himara, and other provinces considered as integral part of Albania. Other delegates as Sotir Peçi and Idhomene Kosturi declared they would not participate because the delegates were not elected legitimately, so they did not represent Korça region. According to them, the selection process was done by \\"shouting out load the names, and urging people\\". The proceedings continued with the delegates showing trust to the war-winning powers, and a special greeting to the US President Woodrow Wilson who had revealed and supported the principles of self determination of the nations. Meanwhile, Luigj Gurakuqi mentioned the declarations of the US Senator Henry Lodge published in early December right before the congress. The declaration mentioned that one of the cornerstones of future peace is the creation of Albania out of all those who speak Albanian. Therefore, Lodge's name was added to Wilson's in the special greeting list. The congress discussed regarding the Italian side, which could show interest in supporting the territorial claims of the Albanians. According to Myfid Libohova's memories, it appears that Mehmet Konica submitted an Italian proposal for the formation of an Executive Committee which will try to delegate an Albanian representative body to the Peace Conference and will operate within the country ensuring national and political life of the Albanian people. On the other hand, Mehmet Konica supported the proposal of Namik Delvina and Riza Dani, for the creation of a provisional government, which should be accepted by Rome authorities. He asked that before this was announced, it was necessary to obtain a response from Rome, hoping that the Italians would finally accept it. While several other delegates stated that the government was the desire of the Albanian people and it did not matter if it would be accepted by Italy or not. Afterwards, the congress went through the established agenda. The delegates refused the first point on the agenda, which stipulated the formation of a committee that, based on the record, had two tasks: first, send an Albanian delegation at the Peace Conference; and second, to ensure national political life of the Albanian people. The delegates decided the formation of an interim government, which was an independent decision and defiant against the diplomatic positioning of Rome so far. Regarding this issue there were two positionings, which were expressed by Mehmet Konica's words on December 26: \\"When the delegates, by an absolute majority, agreed on the formation of the interim government after accepting the decisions of the yesterday's meeting, even the Italian command which was given the news, was kind enough to commit to communicating it to its own government. In two or three days the answer from Rome will come, stating that it has been accepted or not\\". Meanwhile, Hikmet Bey Delvina said that Albanians honored the Italian Command allocated in Albania for the care and kindness showed towards Albanians, but he strongly pointed that it did not matter whether Rome would accept the decision of the congress, what was worth was that Albanian people wanted and declared the Provisional Government through their delegates in the national meeting. Vasil Dilo stated that the congress should not act independently. He supported this approach in several ways: first, the Albanian people were not ready and had not reached that degree of maturity as to shed blood for their country; second, it would be risky for Albania, considering this lack of readiness, to express political stands and operate independently; third, an independent movement will lead to the demolition of Albanian relations with the only friend it had, which was Italy. This attitude is reinforced by a debate he had with Mehdi Frashëri, expressing the opinion \\"we as delegates do not have the power to form a government\\". But even the other side had strong arguments. Only an effective Albanian Government would serve as a center where Albanians could see real hope and the possibility of resolving the national question, while any sort of council or committee would be only a \\"feeble and ridiculous institution, leaving both free path to foreign intrigues\\". The existence of a committee will also give more freedom to Essad Toptani, because he was a strong and pragmatic opponent more than any other Albanian politician, he was one of the most powerful of the feudal class as for his military strength and financial means, and he armies were present and active along the borders at the time of the congress. The platform of creating an Albanian Government prevailed and was made official. On the morning of 26 December, Konica presented a memorandum to Lieutenant E. Lodi, explaining the government formation, first of all the importance that it had for devaluing any possible attempt of France and the Balkan states to call Essad Toptani delegates at the Peace Conference. This further was confirmed by a letter of Gurakuqi, which dates December 26, 1918. Among other things, he cautioned that there were only a theoretically independent Albanian state, relying morally on Italy. But the fact that was troubling Albania even more was that France and some Balkan countries already recognized Esad Pasha as head of the Albanian government in exile, proving that they would support his delegation in the Peace Conference. Lodi had already reported to Rome that despite his effort for influencing the congress to elect only and Executive Committee, the \\"strong fraction\\" would prevail.  Italian reaction  The foreign policy of Italy was focused on the political situation in Albania. Therefore, Sonnino sent a telegram to the supreme commander of Italian Forces in the Balkans, Settimo Piacentini on December 29, 1918, asking to be informed on how the discussions were going, and how the delegates managed to create the Provisional Government in contradiction with Italian expectations. He also advised to carefully consider the factual and legal relations between the occupying military authorities and the newly created governing body. Sonnino later would recognize the authorities and the composition of the Provisional Government created, though fearing any controversy by the Great Powers.  Outcome  In addition to establishing the Albanian Provisional Government, the congress defined an initial delegation which would represent Albania in the Peace Conference in Paris. The head of the delegation would be Turhan Pasha, and as members Luigj Bumçi, Mehmet Konica, Mihal Turtulli, and Mit'hat Frashëri. (The list would change later, other names would come and go during various stages of the Conference, including Christo Dako, Parashqevi Qiriazi, Edith Durham, Sotir Kolea, Gjergj Fishta as Secretary General, etc.) All members of the initial delegation came from within the government. Moreover, the congress expressed its disapproval and concern regarding the outcome of the Treaty of London (1915), through two basic issues related to Albania. First, on the political level, through the creation of the government, Albanians rejected the Italian protectorate over Albania with representation by the state of Italy in relations with the world, as was contemplated in section VII of the Treaty. Congress restated that the majority of the decisions of the London Conference of 1912–13 were intact, along with the full sovereignty of the Albanian state already formed. Second, it rejected any decision affecting Albanian territories. The delegates expressed bitterness over this point VI of the Treaty, by which it recognized Italian sovereignty over Valona, as well as to point VII, under which Italy would not oppose the passage of southern and most northern Albania to Greece and Serbia - Montenegro, in case this would have been also required by other signatories of the Treaty, as France and/or England. The congress rejected point V as well, which accepted the existence of an \\"Muslim\\" Albanian state in central Albania. Another critic went to the Italians for creating obstacles for Vlora delegates to be part of the congress. In the same sense also addressed other provinces, which were unable to be represented. It was strongly emphasized that these territories be considered part of the Albanian state.  Government of Durrës  The composition of government was proposed since the first session of the meetings. Government of the Principality of Albania: 28 December 1918 – 28 January 1920: * Turhan Përmeti - Head of State and Prime Minister of Albania * Prênk Bibë Doda - Deputy Prime Minister * Myfid Libohova - Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without portfolio * Monsignor Luigj Bumçi - Minister without portfolio * Mustafa Merlika-Kruja - Minister of Posts and Telegraphs * Mihal Turtulli - Minister without portfolio * Mehmet Konica - Minister of Foreign Affairs * Sami Bey Vrioni - Minister of Agriculture * Mit'hat Frashëri - Minister without portfolio * Luigj Gurakuqi - Minister of Education * Lef Nosi - Minister of National Economy (short time) * Mehdi Frashëri - Minister of the Interior * Fejzi Alizoti - Minister of Finances * Petro Poga - Minister of Justice  Governmental programme  The congress drafted a general political programme, which focused in three main directions: maintaining the independence and sovereignty of the Albanian state, the territorial integrity of the state and the revision of the 1913 ethnic borders, and internal order. Regarding the controversial issues related to the legal status of the state and political preferences towards any war-winning force, which had brought up enough disagreements and discussions, an internal silent agreement took place without being officialized. Despite the decisions taken, Albania was still under foreign occupation.  Aftermath   Attitude towards the Congress of Lushnjë  The new government did not last long, which was expected considering the turbulent years of 1918–1919. But the event held immediately after World War I showed the continuity of the Albanian state, which was put in doubt after the departure of Prince Wied. A little more than a year later, another congress was organized in Lushnjë. This one would bring at a higher level the institutionalization of the Albanian state, giving it a constitution and a government, although the head of state issue was still pending. No the all old-cast Albanian leadership of Durrës would show friendly feelings towards the new event. According to Sejfi Vllamasi's (1883–1975) memories there were serious contradictions between the two camps. These include the assassination of the Prefect of Durrës (and delegate to Lushnjë) Abdyl Ypi (1876–1920) by Sul Mërlika, himself cousin of Mustafa Mërlika-Kruja, the prohibition of Krujë delegates to join the congress, the attempts to stop the delegates of Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo by Mërlika-Kruja, as well as failed attempts of Fejzi Alizoti and Myfid Libohova to stop other delegates from north and south of the country even involving Italian militia. Nevertheless, the Government of Durrës resigned right before its start, on January 29, 1920, allowing the continuation of the political consolidation of the country.  Part of the Albanian history  The Congress of Durrës is considered an important step in the Albanian state-forming process. A full assessment on the program of the government is still missing. The Albanian historiography after World War II took a critical attitude towards it, its key leaders, and the pro-Italian spirit that characterized it. Specifically, the critics went to Pan-Albanian Federation of America (Vatra), considered one of the strong pillars of Albanian nationalism, which compromised with Italy regarding the formation of the government of Durrës. The Albanian government that was created was considered \\"a little more than an Italian puppet\\". A retrospective view shows that perhaps that was a right attitude. The agreements that came out were a consequence of historical circumstances that changed at the end of the war, such as disruption of equilibrium in the Balkans as a result of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Description The Samar cobra is a species of spitting cobra that can grow up to 1.4 meters in length. Their coloring varies from a black and yellow to green. Scalation There are 17-25 scale rows around the hood, 17-19 ahead of mid-body; 161-184 ventrals, 41-52 subcaudals, basal pairs sometimes undivided.http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~bss166/Taxa/AsNaja.htm Distribution and habitat The Samar cobra is endemic to the southern Philippines. Specifically, the Visayas and Mindanao island groups. Habitat can vary widely from mountainous jungle to tropical plains. They can live close to human settlements. Behavior Like the Philippine cobra (Naja philippinensis), the Samar cobra feeds mostly on rodents. They will also prey upon frogs and reptiles. Since their main food source is attracted to rice paddies and human settlements, this species often comes into conflict with people. Venom The Samar cobra's venom is a potentially deadly neurotoxin, with cytotoxic properties as well. Envenomations can result in respiratory distress and paralysis, as well as considerable tissue necrosis around the bite site. They are noted for their nervous behavior, and are quick to strike as well as to spray venom, which they generally aim towards the face and eyes. If venom gets in the eyes, it causes extreme pain and mechanical damage to the eyeball. If not properly flushed out, it can result in permanent blindness due to its tissue destroying properties. Antivenin for the Samar cobra is produced in the Philippines, but is not widely available due to this species' restricted distribution and thus, relatively low numbers of individuals.

The attack resulted in a two-year delay before Fort Victoria became fully operational. Early IRA actions against shipping One of the first IRA attacks on British ships since the Irish War of Independence was carried out against the Royal Navy fast-attack patrol boat HMS Brave Borderer, which was damaged by gunfire from a Boys anti- tank rifle in September 1965 while paying a visit to Waterford, Republic of Ireland.White, Robert Williams (2006).

After a telephone warning from the IRA,Explosion Rips British Navy Ship in Belfast Reuters, 7 September 1990 one of the bombs exploded, causing extensive damage inside the engine room, which was holed and subsequently flooded. The ship listed 45 degrees, and the chances of sinking were high. The situation was under control after hours of work by emergency teams, which pumped the water out of the engine room. John Parker, the shipbuilder, praised the courage of the engineers for saving the ship. It was not learned that a second device had failed to explode until a second IRA phone call 24 hours later. It took two weeks to find and disable the second bomb, which stalled the works further.From an interview to shipbuilder Sir John Parker published by Sunday Times, 13 March 2006: :The contract for Fort Victoria was won, but the ship became a target for the IRA. \\"She was afloat in the dock when we got the call from the IRA. Later that day the bomb went off and blew a hole in the engine room of the ship. The ship heeled over to about 45 degrees and we thought we were going to lose her. Fortunately some very courageous engineers went on board and lowered pumps in to clear the engine room so we could save the ship.\\" The next day there was a call about a second bomb.

It runs in a southwest to northeast direction from LA 8 east of Colfax to US 165 east of Breezy Hill. The signage for LA 123 carries east–west directional banners unlike most odd numbered state highways in the primary range, which are bannered north–south. The highway traverses a thickly forested area located almost entirely within the Kisatchie National Forest. About midway along its route, LA 123 passes through the village of Dry Prong, located on US 167\\\\. LA 123 comes close to intersecting a third U.S. route, as its western terminus is located less than from US 71 near the town of Colfax, the seat of Grant Parish. US 71, US 165, and US 167 all diverge northward out of Alexandria, the principal city of central Louisiana, located in neighboring Rapides Parish. Route description From the west, LA 123 begins at a T-intersection on LA 8 located about east of Colfax and east of US 71 in Grant Parish. The route heads northeast, winding through the thick piney woods of the Kisatchie National Forest's Catahoula Ranger District. After , rural residences begin to line the highway, and LA 123 soon enters the village of Dry Prong. At an intersection with Grove Street, the highway meets the eastern terminus of LA 122, connecting with Verda and Montgomery. Shortly afterward, LA 123 crosses US 167, an undivided four-lane highway connecting with the cities of Winnfield and Alexandria to the north and south, respectively. After crossing the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line at grade, LA 123 proceeds northeast out of Dry Prong and takes a serpentine path through the largely uninhabited pine forest. later, after a nearly right-angle curve in the roadway, LA 123 passes through a point known as Breezy Hill. Here, it intersects LA 524, a former alignment of US 165 that connects to the modern alignment in either direction. LA 123 continues eastward for another to its own junction with US 165, a divided four-lane highway whose immediate destinations are Georgetown to the north and Pollock to the south. A local road named Grover Atwell Road continues straight ahead from this intersection to an area along the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line known as Howcott. Route classification and data LA 123 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The highway is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as a rural major collector from its western terminus through Dry Prong. The remainder of the route east of Dry Prong is classified as a rural minor collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 averaged between 570 and 870 vehicles over most of the route. The lowest figure reported was 230 vehicles through the eastern portion near Breezy Hill. The posted speed limit is generally , reduced to through Dry Prong. History Pre-1955 route numbering In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 123 was designated as State Route 617. It was an addition to the state highway system enacted by the state legislature in 1930. The entirety of Route 617 was graveled by the early 1930s and paved during the early 1950s. The only significant difference between the pre-1955 route and the current LA 123 is the eastern terminus, which was originally located at an intersection with the present LA 524 at Breezy Hill. This was the original alignment of the pre-1955 State Route 14, which became part of US 165 when the numbered U.S. Highway system was implemented in 1926. In 1949, US 165 was placed onto a new and straighter alignment bypassing Breezy Hill. The old alignment was retained in the state highway system as State Route C-2115 and served to connect Route 617 with the new section of highway. Post-1955 route history LA 123 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of former State Route 617. The old alignment of US 165 remained in the state highway system as LA 524, continuing to provide a state-maintained connection between Breezy Hill and the current alignment. However, an existing gravel local road was also taken into the system to provide a more direct connection. LA 123 therefore extends slightly further to the east compared to the pre-1955 route. This extension was paved by 1960. Since the 1955 renumbering, the route of LA 123 has remained virtually the same. Minor improvements include a sharp curve at Fire Tower Road between LA 8 and Dry Prong that has been bypassed, as well as a zigzag at Breezy Hill that has been smoothed out.

His father died during the trip and he probably became a ward of Governor Printz when he arrived at New Sweden in 1643. He became a soldier in 1648, and accompanied Printz back to Sweden in this capacity in 1653. The Swedish settlement was incorporated into New Netherland in 1655. Åkesson subsequently returned and probably settled on Tinicum Island in Pennsylvania. The island was sold to Dutch merchant Joost de la Grange (1623-1664) in 1662. Åkesson later traveled back to Sweden where he recruited settlers and returned with them in 1663. Thirty-two Finns arrived on board the \\"Purmerlander Kerck \\" and were settled at Feren Hook on south side of Christina River. As a reward, he received from the Dutch governor a monopoly on the fur trade in Pennsylvania and in 1664 was entitled to become a justice replacing Mats Hansson (1612-1663) on the Upland Court where he served until 1681. By this time, his military rank had risen to captain, and he had adopted the surname Helm. In his trading with the local American Indians, he learned their language, and was frequently employed as an interpreter. He acted as such in 1675 at the conference between English Gov. Edmund Andros, the magistrates of New Castle, Delaware, and the Lenape sachems of New Jersey, when their treaty of peace was renewed. In 1677, he was living in Gloucester County, New Jersey, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died during 1701 and was buried with his wife in the cemetery at Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church on Tinicum Island.

Launched June 2, 1940, this was a tabloid-sized newsprint comic book sold as part of eventually 20 Sunday newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. In a 2004 interview, Eisner elaborated on the origins of the supplement: The Spirit Section generally included two other, four-page strips (initially Mr. Mystic and Lady Luck), plus filler material. Eisner was the editor, but also wrote and drew most entries — after the first few months, he had the uncredited assistance of writer Jules Feiffer and artists Jack Cole and Wally Wood, though Eisner's singular vision for the strip was a unifying factor.

The monument was designed by Lloyd Pinay, of the Peepeekisis First Nation in Saskatchewan, whose father took part in the D-Day assault in World War II. It was unveiled in Confederation Park by Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, on National Aboriginal Day, June 21, 2001. Creation The bronze monument sits atop a marble base, which was quarried in Shawinigan, Quebec. The monument itself was created in its entirety during 2000 and 2001 on the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation Urban Reserve in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, part of Treaty Six Territory. Once completed, it was then disassembled for transport and then reassembled again in Ottawa. Symbolism The sculptor, Lloyd Pinay, has said that \\"the major theme was that the reason for war is in all likelihood a desire for peace\\". The monument depicts a golden eagle as the messenger between the Creator and man. The eagle or Thunderbird also symbolizes the Creator and embodies the spirit of the Aboriginal people. Below the eagle are four human figures, facing the four points of the compass and representing First Nations, Inuit and Métis. Pinay felt it was very important to incorporate female figures in the sculpture to acknowledge the role of women not only as nurses, but as those responsible for maintaining families while the men were away. The human figures hold not only weapons but also spiritual objects: an eagle feather fan and a peace pipe. There are four animal figures, one on each corner to act as spirit guides, each with a special attribute: a wolf (family values), a buffalo (tenacity), an elk (wariness) and a bear (healing powers).

Revolt  The Pandatsang were an extremely rich Khampa trading family with enormous influence in Kham. The family leader was Nyigyal. The family's servants often said \\"Sa spang mda' gnam spang mda'.\\" \\"The earth is Pangda's, the sky is Pangda's.\\" and \\"I am connected to Pangda, what are you going to do to me?\\". They were behind the rebellion against Lhasa in 1934 and the Tibet Improvement Party. The mastermind of the rebellion was Pandastang Togbye of the rich and powerful Kham Pandatsang family. Pandatsang Rapga was the brother of Pandastang Togbye (also spelled Topgyay), who was a great friend of Thubten Kunphela who was from Nyemo county located between Shigatse and Lhasa, U-Tsang. Partly out of anger over Kunphela's fall from power after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, in 1934 Togbye organized a revolt against the Tibetan government in areas the areas they controlled in the western part of Kham. (that was about one third of the whole Kham region). His brother had military control while Rapga was more of a \\"scholar\\". They aimed to ultimately attack Lhasa, and had to take Chamdo first. He did so in the belief that many monks from Kham originating in the large monasteries near Lhasa would support him in this. The Tibetan government knew that the rebellion originated from within Kham. The residence of his family in Lhasa was confiscated, but ultimately negotiations ensued. The reason was that the family was the main exporter of Tibetan wool abroad, and any further incident could affect government funds. As a result of the outcome of the negotiations, the members of the family did not persecute the rebellion further. While the Kham rebels were escaping from the Tibetan government forces, they were forced into battle against both the Sichuan warlord Liu Wenhui and the Chinese Communist party forces which were on the Long March. Rapga fled from Kham to Kalimpong via Kanting and Nanking after the revolt failed. Grey Tuttle, an Assistant Professor of Modern Tibetan studies, believes that it was possible that Rapga \\"was a devout believer in the political ideology of Sun Yat-sen and had translated some of Sun's more important writings into Tibetan\\" during this rebellion.

Bridges, \\"Courtois, Lambert\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed 7 January 2012). Details of his early life are sparse. Originally from France, he came to Italy most likely during the 1540s, as several music prints there refer someone of his name. By 1550 he was in Rome, where he performed at the church of San Marcello during Easter Week. He briefly directed the Accademia Filarmonica di Verona after their previous maestro di musica, Vincenzo Ruffo, was discharged for being negligent in his duties.Einstein, 462 Courtois only served for several months in early 1553. In May he went to Ragusa, modern-day Dubrovnik, as a trombonist in the court wind band. He remained there until 1570. Three further posts are known: a three- year stint in Udine lasting until 1573, and similar posts in Treviso (1578–79) and Vicenza (1582-83). Nothing further is known of his life after his employment in Vicenza. Of Courtois's works, one book of madrigals for five voices and a handful of works printed in other anthologies survive. Two of the separate works are motets, written in the early 1540s, and attributed to \\"Lamberto\\", who was most likely the composer. The book of madrigals is dedicated to three aristocrats of Ragusa, who were likely students of the composer during his time in that city. Courtois left family behind in Ragusa, including a son and grandson who were also musicians. Notes References * Alfred Einstein, The Italian Madrigal. Three volumes.

He is the Chairman and major shareholder of the privately held Polygon Homes Ltd., one of the largest multi-family builders in British Columbia. Early life and education Audain was born to James Guy Payne Audain and Madeleine Marie Stulik in Bournemouth, England. The couple were living near Yeovil. His father was a retired British Army officer, while his mother had a career as a London dress model. Audain attended numerous schools in the United Kingdom due to frequent moves by his split-up family during World War II. His first nursery school was named St. Georges, located on Castle Street in Farnham, Surrey, while his first boarding school was called Melbreck Preparatory School situated in the countryside outside Farnham. Later, he attended Eagle House near Sandhurst in Berkshire. In Canada, Audain attended Glenlyon School (now Glenlyon Norfolk School) and University School (now St. Michael's University School). Both are situated in Victoria, British Columbia. Later, he was sent to Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario. In terms of higher education, Audain attended the University of Lyon in France, where he acquired a Diploma in French Civilization in 1959. At the University of British Columbia he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1962, a Bachelor of Social Work in 1963, and a Masters in Social Work in 1965. He later attended the London School of Economics and Political Science as a Ph.D. student but did not submit a thesis. In 1977, Audain obtained a Certificate in Farm Management and Rural Appraisal from the University of California, Davis.  Career  In the early 1970s Audain established a reputation for himself as one of Canada's leading housing policy experts. After moving from the position of Director of Community Relations at the Ontario Housing Corporation in Toronto (now Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation) in 1969, he was appointed Housing Program Director at the Canadian Council on Social Development in Ottawa where he conducted a number of research studies on housing issues, most notably a national study on housing for the elderly, which was published as a book called Beyond Shelter. In Ottawa he also started and became editor of a quarterly publication called Housing and People. In late 1973, Audain was called to the British Columbian government in Victoria by Premier David Barrett and appointed Special Advisor to the Minister of Housing, with the task of setting up a housing ministry. During this period he initiated policies that resulted in a significant increase in social and cooperative housing throughout British Columbia. To aid the process, he negotiated the purchase of Dunhill Development Ltd. which became the Housing Corporation of British Columbia. After a term as chairman of the Provincial Commission on Mobile Homes, which published a well-received report, in 1976 Audain established a company called Audain Planning Ltd. to undertake research and provide advice on housing policy across Canada. Later in 1994 he was appointed by Premier Michael Harcourt as co-chairman of the Commission of Affordable Housing Options, which held public hearings and whose report ultimately played a significant role in revising municipal government's attitudes to so-called \\"illegal suites\\" and a host of other housing related matters. From 1977 to 1979, Audain taught as a sessional lecturer at the University of British Columbia's School of Urban and Regional Planning (now the School of Community and Regional Planning). In September 1980 Audain was appointed Executive Vice President of Polygon Properties Limited, becoming a partner in the firm. Then in 1988 he was appointed President, and in 1992 Chairman of Polygon Homes Ltd. He has continued to serve as Chair of the Board since Neil Chrystal's appointment as President in 2003. Polygon Homes Ltd. The history of Polygon Homes started in 1980 when Michael Audain was invited by W.K. Paulus to become the Executive Vice President and a partner in a company that owned an interest in three rental apartment properties. Initially, Audain built residential communities for housing cooperatives and non-profit organizations, but in 1983 he started building townhomes and apartments for the market. The company expanded in 1988 when Paulus sold his interest to Laing Property Corporation. After Laing Property Corporation was taken over by P&O; Limited, a British conglomerate, Audain and his partner Rick Genest negotiated the acquisition of all the shares in the company in 1992, with Polygon becoming 100 percent British Columbia owned and managed. After Genest's death as a result of a highway accident in 2002, Neil Chrystal became a major shareholder in the company and assumed the title of President and CEO. Since 1980, Polygon Homes Ltd. and its affiliated single-family builder Morningstar Homes Ltd. have completed the construction of over 29,000 homes in Metro Vancouver.  Visual Arts  Michael Audain has been a supporter of the visual arts in British Columbia and beyond. In 1992 he joined the Board of Trustees of the Vancouver Art Gallery and with a brief interregnum has been involved in the affairs of the Gallery until finishing his term as Chair of the Vancouver Art Gallery Foundation in 2014. He served as the Association's President/Chair from 1996 to 1998. In 2005, Audain was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada, and then as Chair from 2009 to 2012. In 2019 he was reappointed as a Director of the National Gallery of Canada Foundation.  Audain Collection  1860 Tsimshian portrait mask at Audain Art Museum Michael Audain and his wife Yoshiko Karasawa amassed a significant art collection which is considered among Canada's most outstanding. Particularly strong was a large group of Northwest Coast First Nations masks which had been brought back to the Northwest Coast from the United States and Europe, the acquisition and subsequent donation of a Potlach Figure to the U'Mista Cultural Centre in 2008; a major collection of Emily Carr's works, Canada's most important collection of Mexican modernist works, and one of the leading collections of Quebec artist Jean-Paul Riopelle. The collection was in part exhibited at the Vancouver Art Gallery in late 2012 and early 2013. Nearly 140 works from this collection were installed at the Audain Art Museum in preparation for its opening in March 2016, and have now been donated to form the basis of the Museum's permanent collection. Audain has also commissioned works from a number of British Columbia artists (personally or through Polygon) to allow them to develop their talents, including: James Hart, Robert Davidson, Xwalacktun (Rick Harry), Susan Point, Paul Wong, Marianne Nicolson, and Jay Simeon to name a few.  Audain Art Museum  In September 2012, Michael Audain was invited to Whistler, British Columbia to discuss establishing a museum for his family collection. Less than a year after his visit, the 56,000 square foot Audain Art Museum building designed by Patkau Architects commenced construction on land donated by the Resort Municipality of Whistler for a 199-year lease. Adjacent to Whistler Village, the Museum officially opened to the public on March 12, 2016 and houses a portion of the Audain Collection, a gallery dedicated to 15 works by E. J. Hughes, as well as offers spaces for special exhibitions. It is the only museum in Canada with a permanent collection that exclusively represents the artists of its home province. The Museum published a book by Ian M. Thom titled Masterworks from the Audain Art Museum, Whistler. The Museum is governed by a Board of Trustees chaired by Susan Adams, and is managed by Dr. Curtis Collins, Director & Chief Curator. Michael Audain remains a Trustee. The Audain Art Museum Foundation was subsequently created to raise an endowment fund of $25 million (now increased to $50 million) to support the operations of the Audain Art Museum. This registered not-for-profit charitable corporation is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by Michael Audain. By mid-2020, over $27 million had been donated to the endowment by persons and companies called the Museum's \\"Founders\\". Jean Paul Riopelle Foundation Passionate about the legacy of Quebec artist Jean Paul Riopelle (1923-2002), Michael Audain announced on October 3, 2019 the creation of the Jean Paul Riopelle Foundation. Serving as Chairman, Audain is joined on the board by Riopelle’s eldest daughter, business executives, art historians, and collectors dedicated to celebrating the contribution of the artist to international art history. The Foundation will also serve as a center of scholarship in the documentation, publication and discourse on the oeuvre of Jean Paul Riopelle. The Foundation is managed by Montreal-based Executive Director Manon Gauthier. October 7, 2023 will mark the centenary of Riopelle’s birth and the Foundation is planning to provide a multitude of opportunities to acknowledge his contribution to the visual arts. Philanthropy  Audain Foundation  Michael Audain Chairs the Board of the Audain Foundation, which was established in 1997 to support the visual arts in British Columbia with grants and endowments for capital projects and exhibitions at major public art galleries and educational institutions. More recently, the Foundation managed by Executive Director Chantal Shah, has expanded its scope to include wildlife interests, including start-up funding for the new Grizzly Bear Foundation. The Audain Foundation has supported many initiatives, among them the Audain Endowment for Contemporary Canadian Art and the Audain Curator of Indigenous Art at the National Gallery of Canada (in recognition of this support, together with donations for special projects, collections and operations, the contemporary exhibition space is named La Salle Audain); the new building for Arts Umbrella; the Audain Curator of British Columbia Art, the Audain Emerging Artists Acquisition Fund, and the Post-Secondary Student Engagement in BC Program at the Vancouver Art Gallery; the Audain Curator of First Nations Art Endowment Fund and the new building for the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria; the Audain Professorship in Contemporary Art Practice of the Pacific Northwest and the Audain Gallery and Atrium at the University of Victoria; the Audain Endowment for Curatorial Studies, the Audain Art Centre, the commissioning of the Reconciliation Pole by James Hart, and the Audain Chair in Historical Indigenous Art at the University of British Columbia; the donation of a Nuu-chah-nulth ceremonial club from Captain James Cook's collection, and the Audain Gallery at the Museum of Anthropology; a gift to support Northwest Coast art studies and the Audain Visual Artists-in-Residence Program/School for the Contemporary Arts at Simon Fraser University (recognized with naming the main exhibition space the Audain Gallery); the acquisition of a Bill Reid OBC masterpiece for the Royal British Columbia Museum; the annual Emerging Artist Scholarship at YVR Art Foundation; the Audain Art Studio at Brentwood College; the Audain Great Hall at the Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art; the Gordon Smith Gallery of Canadian Art; the Audain Distinguished Artist-in-Residence Program and the Audain Faculty of Visual Arts at Emily Carr University of Art and Design; the Audain Chief Curator Endowment Fund and the new building for The Polygon Gallery (previously Presentation House Gallery) in North Vancouver; the Arts Umbrella capital campaign for a new building; and the Audain Art Museum building and art acquisitions. In 2004, the annual Audain Prize for the Visual Arts was established to recognize the outstanding achievements of British Columbia's senior artists. The $100,000 award is now administered by the Audain Art Museum. Grizzly Bear Foundation A close encounter with a grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and her three cubs inspired Michael Audain to establish and fund a registered charitable organization in 2016, dedicated to the welfare of grizzly bears. The Grizzly Bear Foundation supports the conservation and preservation of grizzly bears through research and public education. It commissioned a Board of Enquiry to travel the province of British Columbia in the fall of 2016 to seek information from individuals and organizations that have an interest in the grizzly bear. The report summarizing the findings of this Enquiry was submitted to the Provincial Government in March 2017. The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by Stuart McLaughlin and managed by Executive Director Nicholas Scapillati. Personal life  Activism  During the 1960s Michael Audain led a colourful life as a social activist. At the University of British Columbia he founded and was President of the Nuclear Disarmament Club, which among other initiatives, organized peace marches. In 1962 Audain organized the largest peace march in Vancouver since the 1930s. Also at the University of British Columbia, together with a group of faculty members, Audain founded The Penthouse Radical Society, which met monthly on the top floor of the Faculty of Arts Buchanan Building to discuss social and economic issues. Audain also served as an editor of the international magazine, Our Generation Against Nuclear War, and was also a delegate to the 1961 founding convention of Canada's New Democratic Party. In the summer of 1961, he saw action as a Freedom Rider in the United States south, being sentenced in Jackson, Mississippi to a jail term and a $250 fine. He served part of his sentence in the city jail in Jackson, as well as the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. Together with a group of University of British Columbia faculty, Audain was instrumental in founding the BC Civil Liberties Association in 1962, the first executive meeting being held in his apartment in Kitsilano, a neighbourhood of Vancouver. Later he served for two years as Executive Secretary of the BCCLA before leaving Canada for New York City and eventually London. While a student in London, Audain was an active member of the campaign to end the Vietnam War, and was also involved in left wing student activity.

Both the Chinese Landscape poetry and the Fields and Gardens poetry share a common theme of nature foremost with human beings and human thought seemingly not in main focus; however, in the case of the Fields and Gardens genre the nature that was focused upon was more domestic—the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Sometimes, the poems were designed to be viewed with a particular work of art, others were intended to be \\"textual art\\" that invoked an image inside a reader's mind. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many Classical Chinese poetry genres. One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as Tao Qian (365–427), among other names or versions of names).Yip, 163-169 Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.Watson, 79 Translator and commentator David Hinton sees the Fields and Gardens genre as more of a subgenre of the Shanshui (mountains-and-waters) genre, than as a standalone, side-by-side genre under the general heading of Chinese landscape poetry.Hinton, 111-112. Wai-lim Yip's treatment in his Chinese Poetry does not seem to contradict this viewpoint, but neither does it make this explicit.

Common gameplay elements within the series center upon educational activities, mostly focusing around American history and culture, though other aspects such as adventure, puzzle or even action elements are occasionally interspersed in some of the games. Titles Edutainment games The first two games in the series marked American Girl's (then known as Pleasant Company) expansion into video games. They featured American Girl's historical character roster, which of the time consisted of six characters representing various periods of American history. *The American Girls Premiere is the first entry in the series, developed and published by The Learning Company for American Girl and released in 1997 for personal computer platforms. The game allows the creation and direction of unique stage plays starring the Historical Characters, from Felicity Merriman to Molly McIntire. The Second Edition release, which was released in 1998, adds Josefina Montoya to the roster. *The American Girls: Dress Designer is the second entry in the series, developed and released by Mattel Interactive for Windows in 1999. This was essentially an interactive version of the paper doll sets American Girl sold featuring their Historical Characters roster, from colonial era Felicity Merriman to World War II-era Molly McIntire. The game allows players to create and edit period clothes for the historical characters. Users can choose between different patterns, styles, designs and trim for each character, and they can also build and print out a fashion portfolio. Besides Premiere and Dress Designer, Mattel Interactive also published Your Notebook (with help from Amelia), a software toy in the form of an interactive journal based on the Amelia's Notebooks children's book series by Marissa Moss, under the American Girl banner in 1999. Developed by KnowWonder, Your Notebook allowed the user to write their own journals with the help of the titular protagonist, and comes with stamps, text effects and styles to which the user can add to their entries. Games published by THQ In the late 2000s American Girl collaborated with THQ for a number of games based on their franchise. Three of the games were released exclusively for Microsoft Windows, all of which are presented in a 2.5D isometric viewpoint using pre-rendered characters and backgrounds, while the other two, namely Julie Finds a Way and Kit Mystery Challenge, are released for the Nintendo DS. *American Girl: Julie Saves The Eagles is the third entry in the series, developed by ImaginEngine and the first to be published by THQ for American Girl on October 15, 2007 for Microsoft Windows. The main goal in the game is to help Julie find ways to finance an eagle release. The game, along with Mia Goes for Great and A Treehouse of My Own, uses the open-source FreeType font rendering engine, as well as the Lua programming language for most of the game's logic. The game also won a Parents' Choice Award from the non-profit Parents' Choice Foundation in 2008. *American Girl: Julie Finds a Way is the fourth entry in the series based on Julie's stories, developed by Webfoot Technologies and released by THQ on December 3, 2007 for the Nintendo DS. The game loosely follows the plot of the series; throughout the game various mini games are interspersed into the plot. The game also offers two- player multiplayer with three of the mini games. The game's world is divided into different zones, similar to Postal 2, rather than in a single continuous map like in the Grand Theft Auto series of games. Entrances to other areas are usually denoted by a lower-quality backdrop of the zone to be visited, or an interior model with a lower level of detail. *American Girl: Mia Goes for Great is the fifth entry in the series, based on the 2008 Girl of the Year Mia St. Clair, released on February 4, 2008 for Microsoft Windows. The game lets players participate in a number of figure skating competitions. It also features a program builder allowing players to design and customize practice routines for Mia. *Kit Mystery Challenge is the sixth entry in the series, developed by Webfoot Technologies and released by THQ in 2008 for the Nintendo DS. The game loosely follows the events of the Kit Kittredge story arc, although unlike in Julie Finds a Way, the game is presented as a mystery- solving game in the vein of the Nancy Drew series, and does not offer a multiplayer component. Core gameplay consists of mystery-solving elements, with players being presented in a third-person viewpoint. The player is tasked to look for clues to be used as evidence, interrogate suspects or ask for leads, and analyze all the evidence and facts gathered in order to solve the case. Players can also engage in a number of side missions, such as selling eggs to neighbors and other people around the city, or running errands for cash, which can be spent on various perks, upgrades and other items, like buying food supplies or paying part of the house's mortgage. *American Girl: Kit - A Tree House of My Own is the seventh entry in the series, also based on Kit's story arc, developed by ImaginEngine in collaboration with Bon Art Studio and published by THQ on June 23, 2008. The game is composed of several minigames, such as a Puzzle Bobble clone, an anagrams game, and a few others. Players are also rewarded with tools and other prizes that Kit needs to start her own treehouse. Mobile apps Since 2011 American Girl released mobile apps for download on major smartphone and tablet platforms, mostly consisting of simple games and software toys for young girls. Most of the games, which are published by the company, are exclusive to iOS, though Isabelle Dance Studio and Grace Sweet Shop were later ported to Android; newer titles in the series also saw simultaneous iOS and Android releases. *Secret Wardrobe is a puzzle game for the iOS based on historical characters Cécile Rey and Marie- Grace Gardner, released on Aug 29, 2011 to tie in with the aforementioned characters' debut. Gameplay consists of a simple puzzle game where in players have to put clothes in their corresponding places. *Shave Ice is a puzzle game for the iOS based on 2011 Girl of the Year Kanani Akina. Players take the role of Kanani as she serves shaved ice to customers. *Cheer On! is a puzzle game for the iOS, serving as a companion game for the now-defunct Innerstar University online community, released on Aug 29, 2011. *Gymtastic is a platform game for the iOS, released in 2012 to coincide with Girl of the Year McKenna Brooks' debut. Players guide McKenna through a series of gymnastic platforms, collecting stars, bonus items and avoiding obstacles that get in her way. *Port to Port is an adventure game for the iOS, centering on Caroline Abbott as she picks up and delivers cargo on the ports of Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Core gameplay consists of guiding Caroline's ship to a certain port and picking up supplies to be delivered back to Sackets Harbor, while trying to avoid British warships along the way. *Paint Ponies is an app based on Saige Copeland's stories. It was released to coincide with Saige's release and was available for free on the App Store. Players round up ponies by drawing shapes around them. Bonus points are awarded for chaining combos and drawing over power-ups. A coloring book mode with scenes from Saige's world is also included. *Playful Pet is a digital pet app released by American Girl to tie in with their Coconut line of plush toys for the Truly Me doll line. Players choose a pet dog to take care of, to which they can accessorize and play with, along with a number of activities where they can unlock rewards for their pets. *Tropical Toss is a memory based game for the iOS based on the Truly Me doll line. The game takes place in a beach, and players are tasked to copy the instructor's moves as they bounce a beach ball in time with the movement. *Friendship Ties is a crafts-based mobile app for the iOS. The app allows young girls and their friends to design virtual bracelets, either through a pre-existing pattern or a user-created one, and add accessories like buttons and charms. The app also includes instructions on how to make real- world bracelets and other such accessories. *Isabelle Dance Studio is an app based on Isabelle Palmer's stories, released in January 2014 for iOS in line with her debut. A port of the game to Android was also released in July 2014. Players take on the role of Isabelle as she performs her ballet routines. Points are scored by tapping on the stars for Isabelle to reach and to keep them up in the air. Colliding on gems fills up the starburst meter, which the player can use to clear the screen and rack up more points. Bigger stars reward the player with multipliers and other bonuses. If at least one star hits the floor, or if the player accidentally taps on the black pearl, the game ends and players have to start from the beginning. *Scene Sounds is a software toy for iOS, based on the Truly Me line. The app is essentially a soundboard allowing children and their friends to add background music and ambient sound effects while they play with their dolls. Common scenarios include Christmas, summer, winter, and a hair salon. A port for Android was released exclusively for the American Girl edition of the Nabi SE tablet and for Amazon FreeTime subscribers. *Maryellen TV Console is a software toy for iOS, released in 2015 to coincide with Maryellen Larkin's debut. The app is specifically designed for certain iPad models, such as the iPad 2, the third- generation iPad, the fourth-generation iPad, and the iPad Air, as it is intended to run as a companion app for the Maryellen TV Console toy which acts as a specially-designed case for the aforementioned iPad models. Users can watch pre-made stop-motion scenes made with the Maryellen doll, or record their own with a selection of templates and background music. Users can also listen to a number of 1950s-style music that came with the app. *Grace's Sweet Shop is a mobile game for iOS and Android. Players take on the role of Grace Thomas as they mix, bake and decorate pastries in a French bakeshop. *Maryellen Rocket Rally is a space flight simulation game for iOS. The game features Maryellen Larkin as players design and launch space rockets, guiding them to fuel pickups and coins along the way. A port for Android was released exclusively for the American Girl edition of the Nabi SE tablet and for Amazon FreeTime subscribers. *Lea Born for Adventure is an action-adventure mobile game for iOS. Players guide Lea Clark in a series of adventures in Brazil, where she guides baby turtles to safety and rescues a sloth. *WellieWishers is a mobile game for iOS, released on Jun 23, 2016 to coincide with the release of the WellieWishers line for younger girls. The app consists of a series of minigames, among them a basic digital pet where players can feed and pet a rabbit, a music-based minigame where the WellieWishers characters can stage a musical performance, and a minigame allowing players to make a mud pie. A freemium sequel for iOS and Android, subtitled Garden Fun, was developed by [x]cube Games and published by American Girl on October 4, 2017. Common elements Most games in the series puts players in the role of an American Girl character, typically a Historical/BeForever character like Kit Kittredge or a contemporary one such as any of the Girl of the Year characters like Grace Thomas, Isabelle Palmer or Lea Clark. The games' presentation may vary from one title to the next, from an edutainment game typical of The American Girls Premiere and Dress Designer, a Nancy Drew-esque mystery as seen in Kit Mystery Challenge, to an action-adventure platform game as seen in Lea Born for Adventure. History The first game in the series, The American Girls Premiere for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS, marked the debut of Pleasant Company into the digital software space. Linda Ehrmann, vice president of Internet business strategy consulting firm Grey Interactive, said that the video game had a due potential as it was entering a relatively untapped market, commenting that in the interactive media space, \\"girls are for the most part totally ignored.\\" Reception The American Girls Premiere was released to mostly positive reception, and received accolades from various parenting organizations; subsequent games in the series however received tepid to negative scores from gaming publications - American Girl: Kit Mystery Challenge for example was panned for its repetitive gameplay, tank controls and lack of replay value.

Viperin is a multifunctional protein in viral processes that is an interferon stimulated gene. It has been reported that viperin could be induced by either IFN-dependent or IFN- independent pathways and certain viruses may use viperin to increase their infectivity.  Function  Viperin is an interferon-stimulated gene whose expression inhibits many DNA and RNA viruses including CHIKV, HCMV, HCV, DENV, WNV, SINV, influenza, and HIV. Initially identified as an IFN-γ induced antiviral protein in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infected macrophages, it was reported that viperin could be induced by HCMV glycoprotein B in fibroblasts, but inhibits HCMV viral infection and down-regulates viral structural proteins. The reason why virus protein would induce viperin against itself is still not clear; however, the viral induced redistribution of viperin may reflect the mechanism of virus evading its antiviral activities. Viperin may also be induced and interact with HCMV viral proteins and relocate to mitochondria in HCMV viral infected cells to enhance viral infectivity by disrupting cellular metabolism. Viperin is a radical SAM enzyme which is capable of producing the chain terminator ddhCTP (3ʹ-deoxy-3′,4ʹdidehydro- CTP), which inhibits the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Viperin activity appears to abolish metabolism of amino acids and mitochondrial respiration. In the inhibition of influenza virus budding and release, viperin is suggested to disrupt the lipid rafts on the cell's plasma membrane by decreasing the enzyme activities of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), an essential enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Viperin was suggested to inhibit the viral replication of HCV via its interaction with host protein hVAP-33 and NS5A and disrupting the formation of the replication complex.  Structure  Human viperin is a single polypeptide of 361 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 42 kDa. The N-terminal 42 amino acids of viperin forms amphipathic alpha-helix, which is relatively less conserved in different species and has a minor effect on the antiviral activity of viperin. The N-terminal domain of viperin is required for its localization to the ER and lipid droplets. Amino acids 77-209 of viperin constitute the radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) domain, containing four conserved motifs. Motif 1 has three conserved cysteine residues, CxxCxxC, which is the Fe-S binding motif and also essential for antiviral activity. The C-terminal 218-361 amino acids of viperin are highly conserved in different species and essential for viperin dimerization. The C-terminal tail appears to be critical for the antiviral activities against HCV since a C-terminal flag tagged of viperin lost its antiviral activity. When viperin is bound to SAM and Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) or uridine triphosphate (UTP) is used as a substrate, different kinetic parameters are achieved. It is predicted that the CTP substrate binds much more tightly with viperin because of the low Km value of the substrate. However, the overall structure of both UTP- and CTP-bound compounds are similar. The difference being that the uracil moiety is less effective then the cytosine moiety at binding and ordering turns A and B. Nucleotide-free viperin contains a (βα)6 partial barrel and has a disordered N-terminal extension and a partially ordered C-terminal extension. When the C-terminal tail is ordered, a six-residue α-helix, an eight-residue P-loop (that binds the γ-phosphate of CTP), and a 310-helix are revealed.  Cellular localization  Viperin is normally localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its N-terminal domain, and also localized to lipid droplet, which are derived from the ER. However, it is also found in mitochondria in the HCMV infected fibroblasts.  References   External links  Bernheim, A., Millman, A., Ofir, G. et al.

The cannelure may be pressed into or cast with the bullet or case. Function In the Minie Ball the purpose of the cannelure was two fold. For one it changed the center of gravity of the bullet so that it would turn in flight in the direction it was falling in, instead of maintaining an orientation pointing at the original line of sight from the barrel. The bullet would strike its target by the point, instead of being slightly misaligned. The second purpose in the Minie ball and often in other bullets to be fired from black powder weapons was to hold a lubricant which would reduce the rate of bore fouling by black powder residue. In modern bullets, such as the 7.62 illustrated here, the cannelure is pressed into the circumference of the bullet to provide a strong purchase for the mouth of the cartridge case when it is crimped onto the cannelure. This is done to prevent the bullet from moving either forward or backward in the case. While bullet setback can be a problem with any self-loading gun, it can also be a problem with bolt action rifles if the cartridges used are rimmed or semi-rimmed and are not positioned in a magazine so that the topmost cartridge can move freely into the chamber without catching on, and moving the cartridge below it. If this happens the lower cartridge may have its bullet damaged and also setback into the cartridge creating a dangerous problem. Revolvers that have heavy recoil (and even some that do not if used with poorly crimped cartridges) can have their bullet move forward out of the case. Once they move far enough, the cylinder movement will be stopped by the protruding bullet. Setback In cartridges, the cannelure is a band pressed into the case which helps prevents cartridge setback when the case mouth is properly crimped onto the cannelure. Bullet setback of .1\\" can increase pressure beyond safe limits and possibly cause a catastrophic failure.

The point has been an officially recognised natural site since 1965.Sites de la Baie d'Audierne , Conservatoire du littoral, with map of protected areas During the current geologic era, the Quaternary, the promontory has at times been surrounded by dunes and been an island. Protective barriers have been installed to prevent its being cut off again by the sea, which would otherwise have happened.La Torche / Un haut lieu historique / Les niveaux marins, Commune of Plomeur The surf and currents sometimes make the sea around it very dangerous. Dolmen History The promontory and environs show evidence of human use since the fifth millennium BCE. At the upper end of the promontory is the Pointe de la Torche Dolmen, a tumulus containing several half-buried dolmens, remnants of a multi-chambered Megalithic passage grave. The site was registered as a national heritage site in 1960.Presqu'île de la Torche ou Bogan Dorchenn, Monuments historiques, Mistral Monuments Historiques et Immeubles protégés sur Plomeur, Annuaire-Mairie Several archaeological digs have taken place at the site. The earliest evidence of human activity on the Pointe de la Torche is a Mesolithic midden on the northeast side, consisting mostly of seashells, with some fish and cattle bones.La Torche / Un haut lieu historique / Un sanctuaire de la préhistoire, Commune of Plomeur The burial site was constructed in the Neolithic period with five chambers, four of them arranged symmetrically, and an entrance way which forms an angle and was roofed over in the late Neolithic. Finds from several different eras have been uncovered in the chambers and the corridor, and for reasons of soil chemistry the site was only the third in Brittany to yield prehistoric human remains in significant numbers.P.R. Guiot and André Guilcher, \\"Essai de chronologie des successions pré- et protohistoriques de la baie d'Audierne (Finistère)\\", Bulletin de la Société préhistorique française 44 (1947) 116-21, pdf at Persée, p. 118 Neolithic worked flints and polished axeheads have also been found at Pointe de la Torche, and the sea sometimes uncovers remnants of walls in both rectangular and circular shapes. The point and the nearby dunes are also the site of finds of Bronze Age axes, swords, daggers and pottery, and human skeletons and food debris dating to after the Celtic settlement in the second half of the first millennium BCE. Menhirs have been found in the dunes and at the Kerharo quarry. Sea level was some 10 metres lower in prehistory, so the promontory would have extended further into the bay and offered excellent views. The Musée de la Préhistoire finistérienne (Museum of Prehistory of Finistère) at Pors Carn, Penmarc'h, has exhibits documenting the finds. It also has displays on the cemetery of Saint-Urnel, a few hundred metres away, where remains of over 100,000 people have been found. This has been determined to be a mediaeval burial ground associated with a chapel and settlement which were abandoned in the 16th century as the dunes encroached.Guy Riou, La Torche / Un haut lieu historique / La Nécropole de Saint-Urnel , Commune of Plomeur It was declared a historic monument in 1929. During the Second World War, the Germans constructed fortifications on the Pointe de la Torche, part of the Atlantic Wall.Guiot and Guilcher, p. 117.Yvan Pailler, Des dernières industries à trapèzes à l'affirmation du Néolithique en Bretagne occidentale (5500-3500 av.

Biography Perugia & Giulianova Born in Foligno, the Province of Perugia, Umbria, Campagnacci joined Serie B club AC Perugia on 30 August 2004 along with Giacomo Fabrizi, from a local team of Spello. Despite the club bankrupted at the end of 2004–05 Serie B, a new entity \\"Perugia Calcio\\" was allowed to play in 2005–06 Serie C1 (made the team effectively relegated), where Campagnacci made his professional debut. In mid-2006 he was signed by Serie D team Tolentino, his first club outside his hometown. Campagnacci was re-signed by Perugia in July 2007. However, he only played once in the third division. In January 2008 he was loaned to the fourth division club Giulianova. Campagnacci played an improved 9 games for Perugia in 2008–09 Lega Pro Prima Divisione, the first season since the name change of the third division. In January 2009 he was loaned out again to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Sangiovannese. In July 2009 he was loaned to the town of Giulianova again, where the club won the promotion playoffs in 2009. He scored his career high of 8 goals in the \\"Lega Pro Prime Division\\". The team relegated after losing the relegation \\"play-out\\" to Andria. However Perugia also bankrupted again, thus Campagnacci signed a new contract with Giulianova Calcio. Reggina In July 2010 second division club Reggina Calcio borrowed Campagnacci from Giulianova. He also entered the first session of pre-season camp. Campagnacci was the starting forward along with Emiliano Bonazzoli under the command of Gianluca Atzori. Campagnacci played 27 starts but with 3 goals only. Reggina was able to enter the promotion playoffs in June, losing to Novara in the first round. Eventually Novara was the winner. ;2011–12 On the same day that Reggina presented Roberto Breda as coach, Campagnacci was signed outright from the Abruzzo team. Later Jonis Khoris joined Giulianova as part of the compensation. At first he was the favourite of Breda along with Bonazzoli, where Campagnacci scored 4 goals in the first 5-round (But Bonazzoli failed to score any). However, after a goal drought, Antonino Ragusa was preferred as one of the two forwards in the 3–5–2 formation (round 9 to round 17), ahead Campagnacci. Breda also picked Ceravolo or Bonazzoli as another forward. In round 18 and 19 the coach changed the tactics to 4–2–3–1/4–3–3, which Campagnacci was the supportive striker/attacking midfielder in the first game (for centre forward Bonazzoli along with Ragusa) and as a centre forward in the second one (which Ceravolo and Ragusa were his partner). Campagnacci scored in the latter one, made him secured a place in starting eleven. Breda brought back 3–5–2 formation to partner with Alessio Viola or Bonazzoli in round 20 and 21 (with the latter one without departed playmaker Missiroli, also the team top-scorer; was replaced by Nicolas Viola), However Breda could not save his position where he was axed after round 21, a 0–0 draw, the first match after the winter break. Campagnacci made 11 starts under Breda and 10 of them before the winter break. Under new coach Angelo Gregucci, the coach changed to use 3–4–3 formation against Modena (round 22), and Campagnacci remained in starting XI to partner with Bonazzoli and Ceravolo. The game ended in 3–3 draw. The coach then changed to use 3–5–2 formation since round 23. He only missed the round 24 and 26 to squad rotation. He scored once in round 25 and again round 27. Campagnacci wore no.87 shirt, his year of birth since 2010–11 season. Representative teams Campagnacci played for the representative teams of Serie C / Lega Pro in 2007–08 and 2008–09 season. He was selected to Serie C1 Group B under-21 representative team for the Serie C1 U-21 Trophy in January 2008, losing to the Group A. At the end of 2007–08 season he was selected to Serie C representative team for Dossena youth trophy, losing to Grêmio youth team after penalty shootout.

She is best known for her photojournalistic images of everyday life, working people, and women, particularly in Canada. Early life Watson was the youngest of four children. Her family was involved in the newspaper business and also farmed tobacco. She and her sister, Amelia Watson, shared an interest in the art of watercolor painting, and at one point set out to become working artists by building their own studio. For about a decade, they traveled throughout New England, showing and selling their artwork. In the 1890s, when they went their separate ways, Watson started experimenting with the camera. Watson also studied photography with her uncle, botanist Sereno Watson. Photography career Edith Watson In 1896, Watson first traveled to Canada, and spent much of the next 35 years photographing rural people, often women, across the country. She sold her photographs to several North American newspapers and magazines; sometimes, she bartered her photographs in order to obtain lodging or supplies. Through these efforts, she maintained her independence and supported herself both as an artist and as a traveler. For many years, she spent time during the winter in Bermuda, renting a cottage in St. George's, Bermuda and selling watercolors and hand-tinted photographs. In 1911, in Bermuda, Watson met journalist Victoria \\"Queenie\\" Hayward, who eventually became her partner in work and in life. The two women lived, worked, and traveled extensively together through isolated areas of Canada. With her camera, Watson documented the lives of people in Newfoundland, Labrador, the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, and then westward into Manitoba and British Columbia, while Hayward wrote about them. The two women stayed with First Nations people in Quebec and Ontario; Mennonites, Doukhobors, and other \\"New Canadians\\" in Manitoba; and Haida people in British Columbia. In 1922, Watson and Hayward published Romantic Canada, an illustrated travelogue of their journeys across Canada. In it, Hayward coined the phrase \\"the Canadian mosaic\\" to describe the region's multiculturalism; the phrase and concept was picked up by subsequent thinkers and artists, including writer and cultural promoter John Murray Gibbon.

With an area of it is the largest island of the group and the only inhabited one. Administratively, it is part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. It is an important nesting site for seabirds. Description Île de la Possession lies in the eastern group of the archipelago, about 20 km west of Île de l'Est (East Island). It has a rugged landscape of mountains cut by deep glaciated valleys. The coastal areas and valleys are covered with herbaceous subantarctic vegetation. The island is uninhabited except for the staff of the Alfred Faure research station at the eastern end of the island, with a maximum of about 20 people. Important Bird Area The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds, of which there are at least 26 breeding species. Birds nesting in relatively large numbers include king, northern rockhopper and macaroni penguins, wandering, sooty and light-mantled albatrosses, northern giant petrels, medium-billed prions, Kerguelen and soft-plumaged petrels, and South Georgia diving petrels. Other island breeders in smaller numbers are southern giant petrels, grey-headed albatrosses and Kerguelen terns. Crozet blue-eyed shags, black-faced sheathbills and Eaton's pintails are resident. The smaller birds nest only at higher altitudes because of their vulnerability to rat predation at lower levels. Other wildlife The goats that were introduced have been eradicated, though black rats remain and are a threat to the birdlife. Both Antarctic and subantarctic fur seals, as well as southern elephant seals, breed on the island. A pod of about 80 killer whales inhabits the surrounding waters.

Nicknamed Lupillo, he began his career with Atlas in 1986–87 and moved to León in 1990, winning a starting fullback spot as León won the tournament championship title in the 1991–92 season.MedioTiempo. \\"Guadalupe Castañeda – Dorados\\" .

In 1993 Castañeda joined Cruz Azul, beginning a spell of club success that lasted until the end of 2000: Invierno 1997 title and CONCACAF Champions' Cup titles (1996 and 1997). He was transferred to Chivas in 2001, playing two and a half years at the Guadalajara club, then moved into the México Segunda División (Second Division) club Dorados de Sinaloa. The club was promoted and he ended his career in the Primera División (First or top League Division) at the Clausura 2006 campaign at the age of 41.

The Excessive Fines Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit certain disproportionate sentences. Further, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for certain crimes, for certain classes of defendants, and in the absence of certain procedures. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits increasing the maximum authorized sentence for an offense based on a fact not found by a jury. Mandatory minimums based on judicial fact-finding are not prohibited. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense. The test of Blockburger v. United States (1932) is whether each crime contains an element that the other does not. Eighth Amendment The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: :[N]or [shall] excessive fines [be] imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. amend. VIII. Excessive fines United States v. Bajakajian (1998) is the first and only case in which the Supreme Court has declared a criminal fine constitutionally excessive. There, the government sought the forfeiture of $357,144 from Hosep Krikor Bajakajian solely as a penalty for not declaring that amount to Customs when leaving the country.United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998). The Excessive Fines Clause applies to forfeitures of property,Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602 (1993). but does not apply to punitive damages in civil suits.Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257 (1989). Cruel and unusual punishments Non-capital sentences The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause regulates non-capital sentences far less closely than capital sentences. As a threshold inquiry, the Court will not inquire into a non-capital sentence unless the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate, even after deferring to the legislature.Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. 11 (2003); see also Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Next, the Court engages in a three-factor test, considering: (1) the gravity of offense, (2) an inter-jurisdictional comparison of the sentences for crime, and (3) an intra-jurisdictional comparison of the sentence given.Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983). For example, the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of the sentence of life without the possibility of parole on juvenile offenders if they did not commit homicide,Graham v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010). or if automatically imposed by statute for homicide.Miller v. Alabama, No. 10-9646 (U.S. June 25, 2012). Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have argued that the Court should not engage in Eighth Amendment proportionality review at all. Capital sentences The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause has more to say about capital sentences. First, the Clause entirely precludes the use of capital punishment for crimes other than murder.Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008) (rape of a child); Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977) (rape of adult). Even with murder, the defendant must personally kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill.Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). Second, the Clause entirely precludes the use of capital punishment against certain classes of defendants, such as the insane,Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986). the mentally retarded,Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), overruling Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989). juveniles at the time of the crime,Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (under 18), overruling Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988) (under 16). and those who are not competent at the time of the execution.Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930 (2007). Third, the Clause prevents the arbitrary and discriminatory use of the death penalty.Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), overruling McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183 (1971). Nor can the death penalty be mandatory for those convicted of a certain offense.Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976). Aggravating factors must be found by a jury.Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), overruling Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990). Aggravating factors cannot be vague.Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356 (1988). The sentencing decision-maker must have the authority to consider all mitigating factors.Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978). Fourth, the Clause requires certain additional procedural rules in capital cases. For example, the jury must be permitted to consider a lesser included offense.Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980). Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) held that jurisdictions could permit prosecutors for-cause strikes of jurors who would never impose the death penalty, but not jurors who were merely opposed to the death penalty.Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). Such a jury is known as a death-qualified jury. Similarly, the defendant must be allowed to challenge for cause a juror who would impose the death penalty in every capital case.Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719 (1992). Facts not found by a jury Article Three, Section Two of the United States Constitution provides: :Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury . . . . Art. III, § 2. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: :In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury . . . . amend. VI. The Supreme Court has held that every fact that increases the maximum authorized sentence or minimum mandatory sentence must be named in the charging instrument, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt--whether or not statutory law labels that fact as an element of the offense or a sentencing factor.Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), overruling Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990); Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000); Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227 (1999); Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151, overruling Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545 (2002). The only exception is the fact of prior conviction, which may be found by a judge.Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998). Because the relevant maximum is the authorized sentences that arises from the fact of conviction alone, without additional fact- finding, this principle invalidates mandatory sentencing guidelines that are the equivalent of increasing the maximum authorized sentence.Cunningham v. California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004). This principle does not prevent the judge from deciding whether the sentences stemming from a multi-count indictment will be concurrent or consecutive based on judicial fact- finding.Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009). This rule was not retroactively applied in habeas cases.Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004). And, it is subject to the principles of harmless error analysis.Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S. 212 (2006). Double jeopardy U.S. Const. amend. V provides: :[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . . The Double Jeopardy Clause, inter alia, prohibits multiple punishment for the same offense In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977). Blockburger is the default rule, unless the legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773 (1985); Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292 (1996). as can conspiracy.United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378 (1992). Due process The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: :[N]or shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . . amend. V. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: :[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . . amend. XIV. In Williams v. New York (1949), the Supreme Court held that due process does not require the use of ordinary evidentiary rules at sentencing.Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241 (1949).

Robertson (born April 10, 1941) is an American lawyer, and retired Republican politician and judge. He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly for three terms, and was an appointed Wisconsin Circuit Court judge in Trempealeau County. Biography Robertson was born in Beloit, Wisconsin, on April 10, 1941. He graduated from Beloit Memorial High School and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Wisconsin Law School, earning his Bachelor's degree and Juris Doctor. Robertson is married with three children and has served as a scoutmaster with the Boy Scouts of America. Career After being admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin, Robertson went to work as an assistant district attorney in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin. In 1969, he was also elected City Attorney for Blair, Wisconsin, and town attorney for the town of Preston. In 1971, four-term incumbent state representative John Q. Radcliffe resigned to accept a role in the new governor's administration. Robertson ran and was elected in the special election to replace him in the 1971-1972 session of the legislature. He served on the committees on taxation and printing, but lost his bid for re- election in 1972. In 1979, another opportunity in the legislature presented itself when incumbent state representative Steve Gunderson resigned his seat to accept a role on the staff of congressman Toby Roth. Robertson ran again and defeated former state representative John Q. Radcliffe in the September special election. He ultimately won one more term in the assembly, narrowly defeating Democrat Rodney C. Moen in 1980, before losing re-election in 1982 to Barbara Gronemus after redistricting. Robertson resumed his law practice, but returned to public service one more time, in 1994, when Governor Tommy Thompson appointed him to the Wisconsin circuit court in Tremplealeau County to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Judge Richard Galstad. He ran for a full term on the court in April 1995, but was defeated.

The technique was popularized by the music of James Brown, later spreading to other genres and performers. The name \\"chanking\\" is either a portmanteau of the words \\"choking\\" and \\"yanking\\", referring to the procedure involved in the technique, or simply onomatopoeia - a word that sounds like what it describes. Chanking was developed by James Brown band guitarist Jimmy Nolen as a part of his signature \\"chicken scratch\\" sound. The technique appeared first with a double- chank on the first backbeat of each bar in \\"Out of Sight\\" (1964),Williams, Richard (2010). The Blue Moment, p.210. W. W. Norton. . and in \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" (1965), a song that typified much of Brown's subsequent work. \\"Chicken scratching\\" itself differs slightly: the fretting hand lightly squeezes the chord on the neck, then releases suddenly to produce a scratch chord. In particular, Brown used chanking against syncopated bass to produce a unique blend of sounds. The technique of chanking spread from funk to reggae music. Alan Warner, then of The Foundations, also utilized the technique, which left its sound legacy in Europop.

Story  A daughter of an accused deceased famous physician, was given to the care to a female imperial chef who is a sworn sibling before her whole family (except the baby) was executed; He Meiniang who raised the child by becoming a butcher selling pork in the market. The child's name was He Tian, disguised as a man to get into the Imperial Hospital to be a physician to cure illnesses and finding a book called 'Collected Essentials of species of Materia Medica', but failed the test. Her amazing acupuncture medical skills came from one of her father's book. But the Prime Minister daughter, Zhao Xiang Ning, didn't know the fact she's a girl and had fallen for her for the incident she caused with a child, Xiao Shi Tou. He Tian, the emperor and a bandit, fake eunuch became sworn brothers. He Tian became in-charge of the Imperial Hospital of the inner palace for curing maids, eunuch, etc. Her actions in finding the medical book created 20 years ago by her father and many others were known to Li Bao Chuan , the dowager eunuch. He knew she is a girl and suggested He Tian to marry Xiang Ning as once The Emperor asked her to check Xiang Ning's body for a hidden book recording lists of ministers committing greed, he tried to harm her looking for that book. He Tian tried to escape from the wedding but they threatened to kill her foster mother if she did not attend the upcoming wedding. He Tian told Xiang Ning she cannot marry a girl. The emperor, Dowager, Prime Minister, Li Bao Chuan and other subjects were at the scene of the wedding ceremony, when coming up to the bow husband and wife had to bow, He Tian removed her groom hat and revealed that she is a girl. Zhang Zhe San(her 2nd sworn brother), Xiang Ning,He Meiniang and the emperor(her sworn eldest brother) plead the Dowager from putting a dead sentence on her for lying to the emperor she is a girl and for losing The Dowager's face because of the wedding. The Dowager decided He Tian be executed the next day at noon, she was rescued by Zhang Zhe San for pretending attempting to kill The Emperor. A new character named Lady Mo appeared. She and He Tian became sisters. She's in-charge of teaching maids how to serve properly and she'd fallen for the Emperor. She caused the death of Princess, He Tian's disciple etc. The Emperor liked her because her face was quite similar to He Tian's. Even though she knew The Emperor only loves He Tian, she worked with Li Bao Chuan and planned to drug He Tian with a special drug that makes one hallucinate, wanting to prove to every one she is a drug addict. The plan almost worked out, only to have He Tian rescued by Zhang Zhe San and Xiang Ning. After the wedding incident and knowing Zhang Zhe San is a fake eunuch, she wanted him to love her by trying out different methods. When He Tian found the medical book, the sworn siblings realized that there's nothing wrong with the series of medical books and the Prime Minister and Li Bao Chuan framed 12 physicians, their families and even servants to be executed that year. Xiao Shi Tou hid Zhang Zhe San, enemies are after him for having the remaining chapters of the series, to trade the fake copies with Xiao Shi Tou's life. But Xiao Shi Tou was shot by arrows as he assumed the chapters are real and went for them and died. He Tian learned about her origin, went to plead The Emperor for investigating her father's cause of death, for that she had to undergo kneeling towards The Emperor on peddles while screaming out her grief. Actually there are 100 over physicians doing the chapters but why only 12 died. The last chapters one of the pages marked and the code is 'Do you believe the Late Emperor died by accident?'. The story unveils that Li Bao Chuan killed Prime Minister when he tried to confess what Li Bao Chuan and he did 20 years ago but suddenly The Dowager had a terrible headache as he was dying, he stuffed a letter under the carpet. When The Emperor came back, found the Prime Minister dead. It was raining that night, he and He Tian sat near the carpet and found the letter when the wind blew the carpet. He realized Li Bao chuan did it. The next night, Li Bao Chuan knew he was exposed and tried to strangle the Emperor to death and the method he killed the previous Emperor was also exposed. It was a trap set by Lady Mo for being pressured by him in knowing she was the one that caused the Princess's death and she didn't even have a baby. He committed suicide by drinking his specially made poison that was used to cause the princess's death. Lady Mo becomes crazy when hearing the news that the dowager is making He Tian the Empress as she was kind, cured her illnesses many times and was a better candidate than Lady Mo. Zhang Zhe San and Xiang Ning used her family money to buy porridge for the poor. Although He Tian became an empress, she still helped in curing the sick and old, ending the story of her leaving the Emperor to a far place. Gender representation The beginning hinges on He Tian dressing as a man in order to be able to study and practice medicine. There are several other instances of women dressing as men in contrast to one instance of a man, Zhang Zhesan, being forced to dress as a girl to embarrass him. The only time gender roles or the patriarchy were discussed was when a woman (Mo Yanrou) was trying to manipulate the heroine (He Tian). He Tian seems like she'd be a capable and strong female character on paper, yet she is portrayed to be passive and gullible, especially in the second half of the series. This is a typical tale of a kind-hearted, self- sacrificing heroine experiencing troubles and eventually living happily ever after. At one point she was about to be executed for a crime she did not commit and she cried for being a burden to people trying to help her be acquitted,and apologised. The show also makes numerous references to eunuchs and them having been castrated. At one point the trio talk about if the two boys got castrated they could all be sisters. Presumably all these penis references are intended to be funny. The chief eunuch has a big jar which he keeps his penis in, and this being stolen is the inciting incident for the entire story unfolding. He also has bright lipstick and speaks with a high pitched voice- he is the main villain of the first 20 episodes. The use of cross dressing and wounded masculinity for comedy points is typical of a less liberal society that wasn't part of the western feminist movement. The weakness of the female lead may also be due to the legacy of communism and state controlled media, as well as continued censorship and self censorship in mainland china. The characters have very little depth or grey to them, it is clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are - to the point that the whole thing looks like parody.

They faced continuing attacks from Confederate forces under Col. Douglas H. Cooper. Background With the secession of eleven Southern states in 1861, both the Union (American Civil War) and the Confederate States of America vied for control of the Indian Territory. Old tribal rivalries were renewed, with some aligning with the North and others with the South. When a Confederate force under Col. Douglas H. Cooper attacked Unionist tribes in the Indian Territory, Upper Creek Chief Opothleyahola resisted and led Unionist Creek and Seminole from McIntosh County, Oklahoma north to Fort Row, Kansas. These Indian warriors fought Cooper in a series of battles in the winter of 1861–62. They withdrew to Kansas in a bitterly harsh trek known as the \\"Trail of Blood on Ice.\\" Battle of Round Mountain The first engagement, the Battle of Round MountainOn this date in Civil War history: November 19, 1861 - Battle of Round Mountain (150th Anniversary) occurred on November 19, 1861 near the Red Fork of the Arkansas River. The actual location is in dispute as some historians believe it to be near Keystone, while others believe it to be near Yale, Oklahoma. The evidence slightly favors the site near Yale, known as Twin Mounds. Cooper's men arrived there around 4:00 p.m. Charging cavalry discovered that Opothleyahola's followers had recently abandoned their camp. The Confederates located and followed stragglers; the 4th Texas blundered into Opothleyahola's warriors on the tree line at the foot of the Round Mountains. The Federal response chased the Confederate cavalry back to Cooper's main force. Darkness prevented Cooper's counterattack until the main enemy force was within 60 yards. After a short fight, Opothleyahola's men set fire to the prairie grass and retreated. Battle of Chusto-Talasah The second engagement, the Battle of Chusto- Talasah also known as \\"Caving Banks,\\" was fought on December 9, 1861 near Sperry, Oklahoma. For almost four hours, Cooper attacked and attempted to outflank the Federals, finally driving them east across Bird Creek just before dark. Cooper camped there overnight but did not pursue the Federals because he was short of ammunition. The Confederates claimed victory. Chief Opothleyahola and his band moved off in search of security elsewhere. Their loss was estimated by Cooper as 500 (some accounts suggest 412). Confederate casualties were 15 killed and 37 wounded.On this date in Civil War history: December 9, 1861 - The Battle of Chusto-Talasah (150th Anniversary) Battle of Chustenahlah The third and final engagement, the Battle of Chustenahlah occurred on December 26, 1861 near Skiatook, Oklahoma. Colonels James M. McIntosh and Cooper planned a combined attack with each of their columns moving on the camp from different directions. McIntosh left Fort Gibson on December 22, with 1,380 men. On December 25, he was informed that Cooper's force could not join him for a while, but he decided to attack the next day, despite being outnumbered and severe cold weather conditions. McIntosh assaulted the camp at noon. The 1,700 pro-Union defenders were secluded in the underbrush along the slope of a rugged hill. McIntosh devised a plan to converge on the crest, with the South Kansas-Texas Cavalry (also known as the 3rd Texas) ordered to charge directly up the steep bluff on foot. The 11th Texas advanced to their left using a defile for concealment, while the 6th Texas circled to the right. As the Confederate attack progressed, the Native Americans began to fall back, taking cover for a while and then moving back. The retreat became a rout as the Federals reached their camp. The Indians attempted to make a stand there but were forced away again by 4:00 p.m. The survivors fled; many went all the way to Kansas where they found loyal Unionists. Three hundred Cherokees under Col. Stand Watie intercepted the fleeing Creeks and Seminoles, killing 15 of them. Sonuk Mikko's band of Seminole Indians covered the rear after the battle against Cherokee chief Stand Watie. Aftermath Chief Opothleyahola's band mounted no further resistance, and nearly 2,000 of them died on or shortly after the trek to Fort Row, Kansas, mostly due to exposure and disease.On this date in Civil War history: December 26, 1861 - Battle of Chustenahlah (150th Anniversary) Survivors eventually settled near Fort Belmont, where more members died of exposure and starvation during the winter. Many made their way to other parts of eastern Kansas like LeRoy's post and formed the First Indian Home Guard.

Owned by Sri Lanka Railways, the state-owned railway operator, the station is one of the busiest in the country, linking the north with the capital Colombo. The popular Yarl Devi service, which operates on the Northern Line, calls at this station. In the late 1980s the station suffered heavy damage due to the civil war. All railway services on the Northern Line north of Vavuniya had stopped by 1990. The station was abandoned, suffering further damage in the following years. The civil war ended in 2009 and the government started various projects to rebuild the line and stations. The Northern Line between Pallai and Jaffna was re-opened on 13 October 2014. History Origins In the late 19th century residents in northern British Ceylon started campaigning for the construction of a railway line linking the north to the south. The Jaffna Railway Commission report, published in 1891, recommended the construction of a new railway line (now known as the Northern Line) from Polgahawela to Kurunegala and a survey of a line to Jaffna. The line would join the Main Line at Polgahawela Junction, allowing trains to run to the capital Colombo. Approval was given in 1892 and the new line to Kurunegala opened on 14 February 1894. Approval was given in December 1897 for the construction of the Northern Railway and an announcement was made in the Legislative Council in October 1899 that authorisation had been given for the construction of a railway line connecting the north with Colombo. Tenders for the construction of railway line from Kurunegala to Kankesanthurai were called in January 1900 and construction of the new line started at Kurunegala in April 1900. Construction of the Kankesanthurai- Chavakacheri section, including Jaffna, began in July 1900. This section was officially opened by Governor Sir J. W. Ridgeway on 11 March 1902. The Chavakacheri-Pallai section was opened on 5 September 1902. The Northern Railway line up to Anuradhapura was opened on 1 November 1904 and the construction of the line up to Medawachchiya was completed on 11 March 1905. The construction of the line was completed in the next few months and on 1 August 1905 the first train from Colombo arrived at Jaffna Railway Station. The journey took 13 hours and 20 minutes. The single track line between Kankesanthurai and Vavuniya had 16 stations and 12 sub-stations. 20th- century height An express train called Yarl Devi was introduced on the Northern Line on 23 April 1956, cutting the journey time between Jaffna and Colombo to 7 hours. The service flourished and Jaffna became the second largest station in the country. The Yarl Devi service was the largest revenue earner for Sri Lanka Railways. Eight passenger trains and six freight trains operated daily between Jaffna and Colombo. By the early 1980s six thousand people travelled daily on the Northern Line. War and Closure Abandoned station in August 2011 The line's fortunes waned when the civil war started in 1983 - the government increased the number of soldiers stationed in the north, many of whom used the line to return to their homes in the south. Thus the Yarl Devi service became a target for Tamil militants as it passed through areas they controlled. It was blown up by Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization cadres near Murikandy, Mullaitivu District on the night of 19 January 1985, killing 34 people including 22 soldiers and destroying the tracks. The service was attacked again on 25 March 1986 between Puliyankulam and Vavuniya. The railway tracks were relaid by the Indian Peace Keeping Force and in August 1987 the Jaffna-Colombo rail services resumed. However, the deteriorating security meant that only a few people used the service. After the IPKF withdrew from Sri Lanka in 1990 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam took over most of the territory the IPKF had controlled, including Jaffna. In the middle of 1990 the truce between the LTTE and Sri Lankan government broke down and full-scale war erupted. Intense fighting took place in and around Jaffna as the Sri Lankan military tried to regain control of the area. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the fighting took refuge in Jaffna Railway Station. The station was bombed by the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) on 9 August 1990, damaging 6 train carriages and killing eight people nearby. The station was bombed to a shell by the SLAF. On 13 June 1990 the Yarl Devi service rolled into Jaffna but it could not return to Colombo as the railway track had been destroyed (it would be the last rail service into Jaffna). The station was bombed again on 16 August 1990. In the next few years the entire track between Kankesanthurai and Vavuniya and abandoned railway coaches were removed by the Sri Lankan military and Tamil rebels for use as bunkers. Reconstruction and reopening Jaffna Station during reconstruction The Sri Lankan government regained control of most the Jaffna Peninsula, including Jaffna, in 1995 but no effort was made to rebuild the Northern Line or the stations along it. Following the end of the civil war in May 2009, the government initiated various projects to rebuild the Northern Line from Vavuniya to Kankesanthurai. The line between Vavuniya and Omanthai was rebuilt by the Sri Lankan military. Thandikulam Railway Station was re-opened on 6 June 2009 and Omanthai Railway Station was re-opened on 27 May 2011. The contract to reconstruct the line between Omanthai and Pallai was awarded to IRCON International, the Indian state-owned engineering and construction company. The project was to cost US$ 185 million and would be financed by a soft loan from the Indian government. In June 2011 an agreement was signed between Sri Lanka Railways and the Bank of Ceylon for the reconstruction of Jaffna Railway Station. The project was to cost LKR 89 million. In July 2011 it was announced that IRCON had also been awarded the contract to reconstruct the line between Pallai and Kankesanthurai. The project was to cost US$ 150 million and would be financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of India. The reconstruction of the entire Northern Line had been expected to be completed by the end of 2013. The line between Omanthai and Kilinochchi was re-opened on 14 September 2013. The line between Kilinochchi and Pallai was re-opened on 4 March 2014. The line between Pallai and Jaffna was re-opened on 13 October 2014. Services This station is served by six Northern-Line trains, including the Yal Devi, Uttara Devi Intercity, AC Intercity, Night Mail and two unnamed services.

History Željezničar always had great support from fans all over Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia (when Bosnia was a part of Yugoslavia ). When Željeznicar won Yugoslav First League in 1971–72 season, fans followed their club across Yugoslavia. In 1976–77 season Željeznicar was relegated from Yugoslav First League, but that didn't stop fans to follow Željo in second league, so the average attendance at Grbavica Stadium was 10 000 which wasn't often in Yugoslav Second League, and after one season in second league Željeznicar won promotion and was again in first league. During that time the most passionate Željeznicar fans were located on the south stand of Grbavica Stadium . Željeznicar was a club supported mainly by working class citizens, and their city rivals FK Sarajevo by upper class. In 1981 Zeljeznicar played in Yugoslav Cup finals against FK Velez Mostar. Match was played at Marakana stadium, and attendance was 40 000. The Željeznicar fans were on the east side of stadium. Despite the great support Željo lost the finals. The best moments oh their history Željeznicar had when they played the semi-finals of UEFA Cup in 1984–85 season. That year except in Sarajevo Željo had a support in other cities such as Konjic, Travnik, Lukavac and there was a group of Željo fans in Novi Sad. In 1987 the most passionate fans of Željeznicar formed an ultras group called The Maniacs. The Maniacs are located on south stand of Grbavica. There was also formed subgroups Blue Tigers and Joint Union. Club supporters For the next years Maniacs become one of the famous supporter groups in country. They followed Zeljo in Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana and other cities across Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and when Bosnian War start, Grbavica a quarter of the city of Sarajevo where Grbavica Stadium is located was on front lines of battle between Bosnian army and Bosnian Serbs forces. Many members of The Maniacs joined Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Zelene beretke. One of them was Dževad Begić-Đilda. He was one of the founders and leader of The Maniacs. Dževad Begić was killed 1992 by sniper shot when he was trying to save wounded civilians.

Although already well known in the Midlands, she rose to international fame in 2010 when she appeared in a viral video playing live in the street along with a recording of Rihanna's song \\"Rude Boy\\".Rihanna's Rude Boy feat Early life The youngest of two children, from very early on her mother always called her 'Rani.' The nickname not only stuck but automatically became her stage name. In an interview with the BBC Asian Network, she states that both of her parents were born in Mirpur, Pakistan. During the construction of The Mangla Dam, like most other British Pakistanis, her family were also displaced from their home. One of those was Rani's maternal grandfather who left for Birmingham to look for work in the 1960s. After establishing himself he sent for his wife and children. Rani's mother was four years old when she joined her father in Britain along with her own mother and siblings. Rani's father joined her mother in Britain after they married in 1990. Rani Taj was born in Birmingham in 1993. Musical influences Although, Rani played the dhol since the age of nine, her first instrument was the viola, which she picked up when she was only six whilst at primary school. Towards the end of her primary school career she attended a Vaisakhi Mela, where she saw the Dhol Blasters playing dhol. She immediately fell in love with the Dhol and asked her mum to buy her one so she could learn to play it. Subsequently, after leaving school she decided to receive professional training. She spent the first couple of years being taught by Gurcharan Mall of the Dhol Blasters and was later also taught by Harjit Singh of the Azaad Dhol Group. Gurcharan Mall had been a dholak player with the group Apna Sangeet and Harjit Singh had been a tabla player with the Azaad Group. Both groups were pioneers in their own right and were part of the first generation of bhangra music to hit the Midlands. As part of the Dhol Blasters Rani also learned to dance bhangra. To gain further experience and provide a service Rani started to play at all kinds of public events such as festivals, parties and weddings. She initially just wanted to be a regular dhol player like many others but this all changed after her YouTube video went viral. Notable sessions In the summer of 2010 Rani stood in a street in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, dressed in full Punjabi dress and candidly mixed to this and Tinie Tempah's 'Pass Out'.Rani playing dhol on \\"Pass Out\\" This spontaneous mix was recorded and put on YouTube by a friend. People all across the world began watching this video and were shocked as well as pleasantly surprised not only to see a female playing a traditionally male instrument but effortlessly. Traditionally, a male domain Rani Taj has challenged the idea that certain instruments can be played by men only. Tours Even though only a teenager, Rani continues to be a role model to young people across the world and pursues her passion for the Dhol. She has also spent tireless hours playing dhol for charitable causes such as the flood relief in Pakistan and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. After her YouTube video went viral, she was asked to perform at many venues all over the world including at weddings, charity events and nightclubs. To date, she has played Dhol in New York, Dublin, Hong Kong, Norway, Pakistan and all over Britain. Rani Taj performed at New York in live studio session.Rani Taj performed in BTR Live Studio – IMDB She performed along with DJ Rekha and Zuzuka Poderosa in Bhangraween 2011. She also appeared as a guest in a BBC Asian Network program with Noreen Khan Since 2011 Rani Taj has spent a lot of time with the Sufi dhol players of Pakistan, namely Gunga and Mittu Sain. She is not only fascinated by the 'Qalandari' style of dhol playing but has played alongside them in various Melas and Darbars all over Pakistan. These include the darbars of Baba Shah Jamal, in Lahore, Shabir Shah in Lahore, Baba Lal Shah in Murree, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh, Heera Lal Qalandar Mela in Gujar Khan and Datta Mela at Datta Darbar in Lahore. Dholis Got Talent At the United Kingdom's biggest dhol competition held in Smethwick, near Birmingham and organised by Gurcharan Mall, she was invited to become one of the judges of the tournament. Not only was she the only female judge in the final she was also the youngest judge on the senior panel that day.

History  Initially, Benjamin Brooke & Co Ltd, a firm owned by Sidney and Henry Gross, had produced the soap in Philadelphia. The soap's highly abrasive agent was probably pumice. Lever Brothers bought the company in January 1899 and transferred the production of Monkey Brand soap to Port Sunlight near Liverpool. The name ‘Benjamin Brooke’ (hence Brooke's Monkey Brand) was retained to promote the Monkey Brand soap on both sides of the Atlantic.

Neo is grouped in different layers, each designed for a special purpose. Neo Layout, layer 3 Most special characters inherit the meaning of the lower layers—the character is one layer above the , or the Greek is above the character. Neo uses a total of six layers with the following general use: Neo Layout, layer 4 Neo Layout, layer 5 Neo Layout, layer 6 Neo keyboard, produced 2017 # Lowercase characters # Uppercase characters, typographical characters # Special characters for programming, etc. # WASD-like movement keys and number block # Greek characters # Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters  Concept   Facilitating Ten Finger Writing  On the basis of the statistical distribution of letters of the German language and research on ergonomics, the neo-keyboard layout aims to shorten the finger movements during writing. The most common letters are therefore on the baseline and the fast index and middle fingers. This allows more words to be written without leaving the baseline compared to other keyboard layouts. For an average German-language text 63% of all letters can be typed from the baseline with fingers on the home row - in contrast to 25% in the usual QWERTZ-layout. In addition, using Neo the hands shall alternate as often as possible during writing and their use be evenly distributed - the QWERTY keyboard layout is heavily left-heavy. The drafting of the letter positions took into account the experience from other keyboard layout reforms. Instead of pursuing a purely mathematical or experimental path, Neo combines the insights of both paths with the goal of improving both the ergonomics and memorization of the keyboard layout.  Layers  Neo 2 has a total of six levels. The first two levels correspond to the German lowercase and uppercase letters and can be reached by \`switching\` as usual layouts. The third level can be reached via the \`Mod3\` , which under QWERTZ corresponds to the \`Caps Lock key\` and the \`#\` key, and contains common punctuation and special characters. Binary and trigrams, which are commonly used in programming, in wikis, when chatting, or in the command line of common operating systems, have been taken into account in the design of this level. The fourth level can be reached via \`Mod4\` , which under QWERTY corresponds to the \`Alt Gr\` key and the \`<\` key, contains a numeric keypad and important navigation keys, so you do not have to take your hands off the main field to navigate in a text document. By making the navigation buttons accessible on the main panel, Neo also encounters the criticism expressed in reform keyboards that text editors like Vim would be more difficult to use. This level can be locked just like the second one. The levels five ( \`Shift\` \\\\+ \`Mod3\` ) and six ( \`Mod3\` \\\\+ \`Mod4\` ) finally contain small and capital letters in Greek as well as other mathematical and scientific signs.  Character variety and typography  Neo allows the writing of virtually all languages with Latin-based alphabet, in particular the dead keys and additional Compose combinations, of which Neo brings many own. The dead keys are located at the top left and right Neo and allow the following characters with the corresponding diacritic when hitting the key. Thus, not only grave, acute and circumflex, but also many other diacritics such as Kroužek, Breve and Makron are possible, including the novel dead button \\"turning\\" \`↻\` , for example, from the sign a creates a ɐ. Together with the fifth level, Neo can be used to create Greek as well as international phonetic alphabet symbols. Nevertheless Neo is clearly designed for the German language; for others a change in programming is necessary. Furthermore, meaningful Unicode characters were placed on the keyboard for which otherwise a character table would have to endeavor, or which would otherwise not be so easy to achieve. These characters include the common quotes (\\"...\\"), the dash (-), the real apostrophe (') and the chevrons commonly used in books and newspapers (\\"...\\"). In addition, the Capital ẞ, standardized in June 2008, is also available.  Mathematics and special characters  On the levels five and six one reaches the Greek letters and numerous characters required for the formula theorem, for example symbols for sets ( ℕ , ℝ , ∩ , ∪ , ⊂ ), logic ( ¬ , ∨ , ∧ , ⇔ ), derivatives ( ∂ , ∇ ), and many more. By means of the Compose key, for example, the sequence \`Compose\` \\\\+ \`=\` \\\\+ \`⊂\` can be used to generate the subset symbol, ⊆ ', which also contains the equality. In addition, the following characters are available with the keyboard layout: biological characters ( ♀ , ♂ , ⚥ ), arrows (↦, ←), physical constants ( ℏ ) and graphic symbols (✔, ✘, ☺).  Typing speed  Another goal was to increase typing speed by shortening the average finger movement, however there has been no scientific research. Some users report faster speeds with Neo, although others see no speed advantage over other keyboard layouts such as QWERTZ or Dvorak.  Genesis  The initial version 1 was introduced in 2004 by Hanno Behrens on the mailing list of the de ergo keyboard. The name Neo is a recursive acronym and originally stood for NEO Ergonomic Oops , so \\"NEO\\", later the interpretation was set to Neo ergonomically optimized . Considered were experiences of the Dvorak keyboard layout (around 1932), the ergonomic layout of Helmut Meier (1954) and some later investigations as well as attempts to have an ideal occupancy calculated by algorithms alone. Instead of treading only a purely mathematical or purely experimental way, as is the case with previous ergonomic layouts, Neo takes both findings into account and combines these with consideration of the ergonomics and the quickly memorable arrangement of the keys. Thus, Neo relies on the one hand on statistical surveys, in particular the distribution of letters in German and other languages, on the other hand studies on ergonomics by Walter Rohmert, the MARSAN Institute (1979) or Malt (1977). In 2005, Neo 1.1 started thinking about how to arrange the keys that are often needed when programming. In it are brackets and special characters on the main field with the help of the key \`Mod3\` , which corresponds to \`Qwerty\` the caps lock key and the \`#\` button and the button \`Mod4\` , which under QWERTY the key \`Alt Gr\` and the key \`<\` corresponds to reach.  Neo 2  Release 2, released on March 29, 2010, introduces a number of fundamental changes: * In the main level, the keys X, J and Q were swapped cyclically. The X was placed on the left hand so that the frequently used key combinations , and for the commands \\"Cut\\", \\"Copy\\" and \\"Paste\\" are on one hand. [7] * The special character level 3 has been completely reworked, as the corresponding shift keys are more accessible. * The higher levels 4-6 were introduced.  Platforms  Since late 2006, Neo has been included in Linux as a variant of the German keyboard layout for the X Window System X.Org in all current distributions. Drivers are downloadable on the project page for common platforms, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, BSD and Solaris. In addition, free learning software is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS; the neo-learning software is an official part of the KTouch project. Under ChromeOS, Neo can be found in the German language settings. Google's Gboard Keyboard for Android supports Neo2.

History The school was established in August 1925 by a Sierra Leonean Anglican priest Rev. Ezekiel Festus O'Reilly. O'Reilly Senior High School is the fourth oldest senior high school in Ghana and second oldest in the Greater Accra Region behind Accra High School, Adisadel College and Mfantsipim School. The name of the school was first known as O'Reilly Educational Institute. The school was officially declared open by the Hon. Dowuona - Hammond, the then Minister of Education. The school was founded with the sole aim of providing education for ambitious lads of poor parents. The shool was to provide a complete course of education lasting twelve years from the infant up to the school leaving - examination. The kindergarten section was the first to be established in 1925 and by nearly 1927, 200 small children were attending the school. The first location of the school was at Korle Wokon (North of Ussher Town) in the basement of a large house in Accra owned Barrister Silas Dove. As the population of the school grew, it became imperative to provide a more spacious place for the school. In 1926, decided to undertake a fund raising tour through the Gold Coast and Nigeria. The project was very successful and therefore he started looking for a new site for new buildings. Fortunately, he had become acquainted with Francis Dove, the elder brother of Mr. Silas Dove who gave him a large plot at Tudu for the construction of buildings for the school. Rev. O'Reilly with the help of the teachers and pupils constructed the buildings by 1927. On 20th October 1961, the school moved from Tudu into a building at James Town previously occupied by Accra Academy. This was meant to be a temporary arrangement because the school was in the process of acquiring a permanent site at Kokomlemle. However this couldn't materialize. Again the population of the school was increasing and facilities needed to be extended and therefor had to leave James Town into a rented premises at Kokomlemle. The school stayed hear for years. Then again, around the mid 1980's, the landlord of the Kokomlemle premises ejected the school. This action led the school to the massive loss of documents and properties of the school. But by the Grace of God settled at Adabraka. The school settled in a 3- story building structure just behind the Holy Spirit Cathedral. In August 2010, the Ghana Education Service directed the school to stop accepting new entrants and prepare for closure. The owners of the building housing the school decided that since the Service could not afford to purchase the building, they would no longer lease it to the Service. However, in December of that year, the Service developed a plan to move the school to a new location. The School is now located at Teshie Okpoi-Gonno. The new building constructed to accommodate the student is good enough for teaching and class activity. The school offers all courses that individuals aspire to pursue.

The book's original title was Regular Cycles of Money, Inflation, Regulation and Depressions. MIT Economics Professor Lester Thurow wrote a favorable introduction for the book with its original title. Retitled, the book entered the New York Times Best Seller list in early 1987 and reached #1 later that year. The book and its sequel, Surviving the Great Depression of 1990, made Batra \\"one of the best selling economists of all time.\\" The book was frequently criticized by economists after it became a best-seller, as it focused on a darker side of capitalistic development, notably Batra's main claim that excessive inequality in capitalist societies can lead to financial crises and economic depressions. Importantly, the prediction in the title did not materialize. Reception In late 1987, Milton Friedman was asked by the San Francisco Chronicle about Batra's new best-seller. Friedman replied that he would \\"not touch it with a ten foot pole\\". In a review in the Los Angeles Times, economist Paul Erdman, considered the book to be \\"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis. It provokes, and we can use the provocation.\\" Marketing professor J. Scott Armstrong was far more critical. Writing in the International Journal of Forecasting, Armstrong noted problems in three areas. First, Batra made an argument from authority based in part on his prolific publication record, but his work was much less cited than would be expected by someone claiming to be a \\"superstar\\" as Batra did. Second, Batra based his ideas on business cycles from a sample size of six and did not buttress his conclusions or methodology with citations to the relevant literature. Third, the reliance on Sarkar's philosophy led to imprecise terminology that prevented a coherent theory. Armstrong concluded that while some recommendations of the book were sensible, others were \\"potentially dangerous\\" and the conclusions drawn by the author were not supported by the text. New York Times reporter Thomas C. Hayes noted Batra's \\"penchant for sweeping generalizations, factual errors and other missteps\\" and that despite impressive sales, \\"many academic and business economists have ignored the book\\". The book was generally ignored after its key prediction failed to materialize in the 1990s. Some says because the predicted great depression already destroyed the USA economy in 1988.

The film is directed by Geoffrey Enthoven, written by Pierre De Clercq and based upon a real-life experience. Plot The Flemish boys Lars, Philip and Jozef are somewhere between 20 and 30 years of age and each has a physical handicap. Jozef is almost blind and needs to use a magnifier. Philip suffers from paraplegia. He can only move his head and can use one hand which gives him the strength to control his automated wheelchair. Lars has an incurable brain tumor a side effect of which is that he is restricted to a wheelchair as a result of his increasing paralysis. The three are good friends and visit each other frequently. Philip, who is able to control a computer keyboard with a mouthpiece, had a conversation with a man who lost his legs during his last holiday at the Dutch sea-side. That man frequently visits a luxury brothel in Spain which is specialized to host men with a handicap. Philip convinces Lars and Jozef to organize a trip to Spain \\"as they do not want to die as a virgin\\". Of course, they have to convince their parents but are afraid to tell them the real reason about the trip. That's why they deceive them and tell them that they are only going to visit some wine gardens in France and Spain. As Lars already made a well-organized plan about the trip and found a tour guide who is specialized in \\"holidays for people with a handicap\\" the parents eventually agree. Some days before departure, Lars goes to his doctor for approval to make the trip, but it seems his brain tumor has grown. His doctor advises to cancel his trip. Philip and Jozef initially cancel as well since they do not want to abandon Lars. Lars however insists that the trip should continue, so they decide to leave sneakily. However, the tour operator can't make the trip any more as it was cancelled by the parents, and does not want to jeopardize his professional and private life by ignoring the wishes of the parents. The tour operator takes pity and decides to send Claude, who also owns a specialized bus. They are surprised when Claude seems to be an oversized, unattractive, grouchy woman who does not understand Flemish (as she lives in Brussels). Philip and Lars dislike Claude and always use abusive Dutch language to describe \\"the insensible mammoth-looking woman\\". Neither Philip nor Lars speak French, so Jozef becomes the interpreter. He is more friendly towards Claude and can't laugh with the remarks of Philip and Lars. Claude seems not to be very sociable. She only drives the boys to their different destinations and separates herself during each break. She does want to help the boys, but is always refused. The three are convinced they do not need Claude as \\"a replacement for their parents\\" and can handle the situation. Soon, they discover this is not that easy. Claude insists that the boys must accept her as they do need her help as a nurse. The three are surprised when they discover Claude does understand the Dutch language. They are embarrassed and ask Claude to forgive their misbehaviour, which she accepts. The following days are very entertaining and Claude decides to overnight in open sky. The next day, she drives them to a hotel. The three are led to a meeting room and are astonished when they meet their parents. They were able to locate their sons via the original tour operator who gave them the mobile number of Claude. Claude, who got a call of the parents, could not refuse the parents' request to drive them to this hotel. She is just out of prison due to maltreatment of her previous husband and does not want to get into new problems. The parents want to take their children back to Belgium. Philip and Lars get very aggressive and scream they do not want to be treated like children. Lars insists that his parents let them continue the trip. Eventually, they approve of their sons continuing the trip to Spain with Claude as a guide. Once they arrive Claude surprises them by taking them to a villa instead of the foreseen bungalow, which is a present from the parents. The boys decide that they want to see the night-life of the Spanish town. Claude brings them to the centre and allows them to take off by themselves. They try to strike up a conversation with a couple of girls and invite them to go to a restaurant together. Although the girls provide them with a recommendation, they are reluctant to join and state they don't have enough time, so the boys take off on their own. On the way to the restaurant, Lars is taken aside by a different girl which he had met before in a shop. He instructs Philip and Jozef to continue without him and takes off with the girl. Later on they are talking but Lars gets sick and is embarrassed. When Philip and Jozef return to the bus after dinner, they find Lars already there, clearly upset. Philip starts ranting about Lars ditching them, but Jozef tells him to 'shut up'. The first visit at the brothel is a disaster as Lars gets ill. During their next visit, Jozef does not want to go as he fell in love with Claude. This seems to be mutual and the two have sex in the tour bus. Lars and Philip enjoy their visit in the brothel. That night, the group decides to sleep on the beach. Next morning, Philip finds a dead Lars. Philip is picked up by his parents to travel to Belgium by aeroplane, whereas Jozef decides to stay with his new girlfriend Claude who drives him back to Belgium on her bus.

Scottish botanist Robert Brown formally described the species in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London in 1810 from a specimen collected at Lake St Clair. Abundant in alpine and subalpine heath, it is a small to medium shrub tall, with relatively small, blunt leaves with strongly revolute margins. The white flowers grow on terminal spikes during summer. Being proteaceaous, O. revolutus is likely to provide a substantial food source for nectivorous animal species within its range. Description Orites revolutus grows as a spreading bush or an erect, woody shrub, usually in height. Branching is dense and the leaves are alternate up the stem. Leaf shape is narrow and fairly blunt at the apex, 7–20 mm long, 1-1.5 mm wide, with tightly revolute margins and a hairy surface on the underside. Flowering occurs in early to mid-summer with the sour-scented flowers arising on terminal spikes to twice the length of the leaves. White in colour, they are 5 mm long, actinomorphic and bisexual with 4 adnate stamens and a superior ovary. The corolla is valvate, tubular in bud and split at maturity. Fruit is a hairy follicle to 15mm containing winged seeds. The species is often confused with Olearia ledifolia in the field, however this unrelated plant lacks the woody follicles. Evolution and taxonomy Orites revolutus is 1 of 9 species in the genus Orites, with 7 endemic to Australia and only 4 in Tasmania. The remaining 2 species reside in the Chilean Andes and Bolivia. Recent phylogenetic work suggests the genus Orites spread over the Gondwanan continent from South America to Australia during the Paleogene, reaching Australia by the Early Oligocene. Fossils of Orites revolutus indistinguishable from contemporary specimens have been recorded in Early Pleistocene sediments from western Tasmania, suggesting the species is at least this old. The name Orites revoluta (referring to the tightly revolute leaf margins) was first published by the Linnaean Society of London in March 1810 in the paper On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae by Robert Brown. However, the orthographic variant Orites revolutus is used just as widely and is often reported to be the more correct species name. Brown's paper also established the genus Orites, named for the Greek oreites, meaning “a mountaineer” (denoting the montane distribution of the genus). The paper included dozens of pages of taxonomic revisions for the family Proteaceae, although much of this important work is not officially attributed to Brown. Distribution Distribution map of Orites revolutus showing Tasmanian restriction. Orites revolutus is endemic to Tasmania, however it is extensive on mountain plateaus at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1300 m. It occurs in rocky areas of better drained soil within alpine and subalpine heaths and woodlands, and may be present both on dolerite and sedimentary substrates. The mean annual temperature within the plant’s range hovers around and rainfall tends to be as high as 1700 or even 2000 mm (67 – 78 in) annually.Kirkpatrick J. B. Pers. comm. Orites revolutus can be seen at many localities within the state including the Hartz Mountains, Mount Field, Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair and Ben Lomond National Parks, as well as Wellington Park near Tasmania’s capital city of Hobart. Ecology An insect visitor to Orites revoluta Orites revolutus is a prominent shrub in alpine and subalpine sclerophyll heath and woodland, commonly occurring alongside Epacris serpyllifolia, Baeckea gunniana, Richea sprengelioides, Eucalyptus coccifera, Empodisma minus, Leptospermum rupestre and Orites acicularis. The two Orites species tend to be roughly similar in their distribution and dominance within the vegetation. The sour-smelling white flowers arise in terminal spikes in early to mid-summer (December and January). Surveys of insect visitors to Orites species in mainland Australia and New Zealand suggest pollination by small to medium insects such as bees in the genera Lasioglossum and Hylaeus and many types of flies including families Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, Muscidae, Empididae and Tachinidae, all of which occur in Tasmania. This is consistent with the tendency of many Orites species to display purple ‘bee lines’ on the white to cream tepals. Numerous seeds develop in hairy follicles over the following months. Orites revolutus may be heavily infested by the seed parasite Symphygas nephaula, which lays its eggs in the developing flower bud before the seed pods have formed. After hatching, the larvae feed on the maturing seeds as they become available. Orites revolutus is a preferred host for this tortricid moth borer as compared to O. acicularis, which has a heavily overlapping range, and plants at lower altitudes are more likely to become infested. It is thought that this parasite may be the most important agent of predispersal seed loss in the plant. The mature follicles dry and split open, releasing the seeds into the nearby environment. The seeds will remain in the soil until there is sufficient disturbance (such as a wildfire) to stimulate their germination, or until they are no longer viable. Studies of alpine and subalpine heath indicate a minimum average fire-free period greater than 250 years, and it is unlikely that many seeds will persist this long. It appears that plants of O. revolutus maintain themselves predominantly through vegetative propagation during the long disturbance free periods, and the great majority of young plants are the result of underground stems. It is therefore possible that the high levels of parasitism witnessed in the seed pods of O. revolutus represent a negligible impact on recruitment. Indeed, O. revolutus is one of the few species in the community able to resprout after fire, a character absent even in O. acicularis Many species of arthropods have been observed inhabiting O. revolutus plants, including members of the families Sminthuridae, Entomobryidae, Membracidae, Curculionidae, and Miridae, and species from the genera Diaea, Rhyzobius, and Nannochorista. Orites revolutus supports a higher arthropod diversity than the generally co-dominant O. acicularis, possibly due to the plant’s more complex shape (and therefor niche mosaic), although this diversity is only evident in full sized plants. Consistent with this higher diversity is a reduction in ecological dominance by a handful of taxa. O. revolutus’ namesake revolute leaf margins are very likely an adaption to the harsh growing conditions of its range, presumably adding structural integrity to leaves often exposed to frost, sleet and driving wind, as well as very high UV levels. The margins would also reduce air movement across the stomata, presumably protecting the plant from desiccation. This is supported by observations that plants growing in shady subalpine pockets—where the need for sunlight may offset the need for a tough exterior—tend to have flatter or broader leaves with recurved rather than revolute margins. Little is known about fungal interactions with O. revolutus, however there is clear evidence of dieback in Tasmania’s Central Highlands that may be attributed to a Phytophthora species.

Early life John Joseph Scanlan was born in South Melbourne, Victoria, on 19 October 1890. He attended Christian Brothers College, St Kilda, after which he worked as a shipping clerk at the Customs Department. He joined the Citizens Military Force in 1910 and was initially posted to 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment). Two years later, by then a sergeant, he transferred to 60th Battalion. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 58th Infantry (Essendon Rifles) in July 1913. Military career First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Scanlan was a volunteer in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Having been commissioned a second lieutenant the previous year, he was posted to the newly raised 7th Battalion. After departing Australia in October, he along with the rest of the battalion spent the remainder of 1914 and early 1915 in Egypt. A lieutenant since February, Scalan was amongst the first of his battalion to land at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. A chest wound received on 8 May ended his participation in the Gallipoli Campaign and he was evacuated to Egypt. After convalescing for over a year, firstly in Egypt and then Australia, he was posted to the 59th Battalion, then recuperating in England after the Battle of Fromelles. Promoted to captain on 1 November 1916, and then to major on 20 February 1917, he held a number of staff positions at brigade and divisional level. He briefly commanded the 57th Battalion in late January 1918 before being promoted to lieutenant colonel on 6 February and given command of the 59th Battalion at the age of 27. Scanlan ably led the battalion during the battles of Amiens and Mont Saint-Quentin and finally, in late September, the St. Quentin Canal. After this latter battle, the battalion was placed in reserve for rest and recuperation, a period during which the war ended. Scanlan returned to Australia in 1919 having been awarded the Distinguished Service Order and a bar, and the French Legion of Honour, as well as being mentioned in dispatches three times. On 1 August 1919, his service with the AIF was terminated.Corfield, 1991, pp. 230231 Interwar period Returning to civilian life, Scanlan first worked as a secretary for the Victorian Prices Commission before turning his hand to farming. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was involved with the Sustenance Department. In 1936, he moved to Tasmania as the deputy governor of Hobart Gaol. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Scanlan was called up from the Reserve of Officers (having been placed on the reserve in 1920) and put in command of the 6th Garrison Battalion. In September 1941 he was put in command of Lark Force, which was tasked with the defence of Rabaul, in New Britain. Lark Force was a mixture of regular Australian Army troops (the bulk of whom came from the 2/22nd Battalion) and locally raised militia, a total of 1,400 men. When the Japanese Empire invaded Rabaul on 23 January 1942 in what is now known as the Battle of Rabaul, the force was quickly overrun and forced to take to the jungle. When 160 captured Australian soldiers were massacred by the Japanese, Scanlan opted to surrender. He spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. Later life In 1946, Scanlan took up the position of governor at his former workplace, the Hobart Gaol, a position to which he had been appointed while still a prisoner of war. Scanlan died on 6 December 1962 in a hospital at Kingston, Tasmania of a coronary occlusion. He was survived by his wife, son and daughter.

The school's faculty members were practicing lawyers and judges from across the state of Georgia. History The school began in 1890 and closed its doors in 1994. It was accredited by the Georgia Board of Bar Examiners. Today the school continues as a scholarship fund for those students who would not otherwise have the opportunity to practice law. In 1890, Hamilton Douglas, Sr., Hooper Alexander, Archibald H. Davis and Charles A. Read, began night law classes for those who were unable to attend law classes during the day. The law school has graduated over 6,000 in its 104 years of operation. It was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1892. The law school conferred the Bachelor of Laws degree and students had diploma privileges along with the University of Georgia and Mercer University. Later the school adopted the Juris Doctor degree as the requirements of admission to the bar included college credits and finally a college degree. Students could return for an advanced degree, the Master of Laws, in litigation. National Legal Fraternity Delta Theta Phi had an active senate at the school. The Wayne Senate was named for Judge James Moore Wayne of Savannah, Georgia, who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1835 until his death in 1867. The Senate was installed at Atlanta Law School in 1914 by Robert S. Parker, late Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Georgia. The Dean of the Wayne Senate in 1988 was James Fabian Bernecker. The School offered the Valedictorian Prize, Harrison Company Prize and The Hershel E. Cole League of Honor Graduates. From its founding, the instructors were always engaged in the practice of law, either as practitioners or as judges (sitting or retired). No professional teachers or instructors were engaged in the teaching process throughout the school's history. The character of the school was defined as a \\"Lawyer's Law School\\". Deans of the law school The late Hamilton Douglas, Sr., served as dean of the law school. His son Hamilton Douglas, Jr. continued the school until Herschel E Cole became the last dean of the school. Donald W. Gettle served as assistant dean for the last thirty years of the school's existence. Robert E. Cochran, II was named an assistant dean in 1985. Board of trustees included Herschel E. Cole, chairman, Charles W. Allen, Donald W. Gettle, E. Lewis Hansen (1985) Dean Virlin Moore and Dean Wayne C. Pressley were also quite involved throughout the transition of Woodrow Wilson College of Law. Events leading to closing In 1998 the State Bar of Georgia modified the requirements for bar admission, allowing only ABA- accredited law school graduates to take the bar exam. This rule change affected the three night law schools in Georgia. Atlanta Law School trustees decided to close the school. The Woodrow Wilson College of Law (founded in 1933) attempted to merge with Georgia State University but was unsuccessful. John Marshall Law School (founded in 1933) was able to meet the requirements of the ABA and continues to this day. Notable alumni Members of the Georgia judiciary, state legislature, and business owners received their legal training at the school. Atlanta's first female lawyer, Minnie Hale Daniel was a graduate of Atlanta Law School in 1911.\\"Atlanta and Its Lawyers: A Century of Vision:1888-1988\\" Helen Douglas Mankin who would later become Georgia's first woman member of Congress received her LL.B. from Atlanta Law School in 1920. Judge Juanita Marsh attended in the 1940s–50s. Other alumni include former New York City Councilman and Congressional nominee Domenic Recchia, Atlanta trial attorney Don Keenan, former Georgia State Representative Chesley V.

It was also the school now attended by Max Peiffer. His half-sister Grace was born in 1913. Max Peiffer passed his Abitur in 1914. In compliance with his parents’ wishes, Max began to study medicine in Bonn, but then soon enrolled at the law faculty and studied law in Strasbourg, Frankfurt/Main and Munich. It was in Munich, in Goltz's bookshop, that he first set eyes on the works of Paul Klee; he was later to meet Klee in person. He obtained his doctorate in Würzburg in 1918 with a thesis on church law and then took his trainee barrister's examination. There then followed several months’ military training at an army barracks in Mülheim/Ruhr. In 1919 he became a trainee barrister at the district court in Hattingen and, in that same year, adopted the double surname of Peiffer Watenphul. By the autumn of that year he had decided to become a painter and gave up his legal career. Travels and friendships Landscape, 1920 Oil on canvas, Sprengel Museum Hannover Slit Tapestry, 1922 Hemp (warp) and wool (woof), Bauhaus-Archiv, Museum für Gestaltung, Berlin In 1919 Max Peiffer Watenphul enrolled as a student at the Bauhaus in Weimar. Walter Gropius gave him permission to sit in on all workshop classes. He was given his own studio and attended Johannes Itten’s famous introductory course. It was around this time that he befriended Oskar Schlemmer, Wassily Kandinsky, Gerhard Marcks, Josef Albers, Paul Klee, Kurt Schwitters and Else Lasker-Schüler. Peiffer Watenphul resided in Weimar until the end of 1923. From 1920 he was a member of the “Junges Rheinland” group of artists in Düsseldorf, making friends with Otto Dix (who painted his portrait), Werner Gilles, Otto Pankok and Max Ernst. The art dealer Alfred Flechtheim placed Max Peiffer Watenphul under contract with his gallery, thus largely ensuring the young artist's financial independence. In 1920 he was able to travel, for the very first time, to Salzburg and Vienna, and in 1921 he had his first exhibition, arranged by Ernst Gosebruch, at the Municipal Art Museum in Essen. His first trip to Italy followed in November 1921, taking him via Rome and Naples to Positano. In 1922 he worked in the enamelling workshop of his former fellow Bauhaus student Maria Cyrenius in Salzburg. While in Essen he made the acquaintance of Alexei Jawlensky. On 1 July 1924, Peiffer Watenphul travelled on a cargo ship via Cuba to Mexico, where he stayed for almost a whole year. During 1925 he visited Jawlensky several times in Wiesbaden, where he exhibited his works at the art museum. There then followed a trip to Ragusa, Dalmatia, with Maria Cyrenius and a trip to the South of France, Paris, Florence and Rome. From 1927 until 1931 he worked as a teacher of \\"general artistic design\\" at the Folkwang School in Essen, where Max Burchartz and Grete Willers, who had been students together with Peiffer Watenphul at the Bauhaus in Weimar, were also teachers. Stays in Berlin and trips to Paris (where he met Karli Sohn-Rethel and Florence Henri) followed, as well as travels to the South of France and Morocco together with the collector Klaus Gebhard. Peiffer Watenphul's interest in photography, which had begun during his Bauhaus years, was developed in greater depth at the Folkwang School. In 1931 he terminated his teaching post there and, in that same year, was awarded the Rome Prize. Italy Max Peiffer Watenphul spent the period from October 1931 to July 1932 in Rome at the German Academy in the Villa Massimo, where other artists residing there at the time included Uli Nimptsch, Ernst Wilhelm Nay, Karl Rössing and Fritz Rhein. He also made friends with Ludwig Curtius, Bernhard Degenhart and Eckert Peterich. In July 1932 he visited Gaeta together with his sister Grace and Erika and Klaus Rössing. In 1933 he received the “Additional Award” of the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, for a floral still-life. Travelling to Italy again in 1936, he visited Rome, Latina, Sorrento, Capri, Ischia and Sicily. By 1937 the situation in Germany was becoming more and more oppressive. His correspondence was intercepted and his paintings were confiscated from German museums: Nationalgalerie Berlin, Folkwang Museum Essen, Städtische Kunstsammlung Kassel, Städtische Kunsthalle Mannheim. The floral still-life, which had won him the Carnegie Award and had meanwhile been hanging in the Nationalgalerie Berlin, was shown in the Nazis' notorious \\"Degenerate Art\\" exhibition in Munich in 1937. In the autumn of that same year, Max Peiffer Watenphul finally decided to move to Italy for good, to which end he was greatly helped by his half-sister Grace, who was married to the Roman architect Enrico Pasqualucci. It was also in that year that the artist's parents moved to Essen, his stepfather having been prematurely retired from his post as headmaster for political reasons. In December 1937, Max Peiffer Watenphul travelled to the island of Ischia, where he met several German painters and intellectuals, including Werner Gilles, Rudolf Levy, Eduard Bargheer and the composer Gottfried von Einem. Heinrich Watenphul, Max's stepfather, died in 1940. By 1941, Max was in such financial straits that he was obliged to return to Germany and take up a teaching post – obtained for him by Georg Muche – at the Krefeld School of Textile Design as the successor to Johannes Itten. He took over the drawing and painting class. Frequent visits were paid to Oskar Schlemmer in Wuppertal. In 1943, Peiffer Watenphul's studio was destroyed in an air raid. The summer of that same year was spent in Vienna, whereupon he taught at the Arts and Crafts School in Salzburg until the winter of 1946. Max Peiffer Watenphul was to exercise an enormous influence on the young painters of Salzburg. As a German national, Peiffer Watenphul was refused permission to reside in Austria after 1946 and so he fled across South Tyrol to his half- sister in Venice, where he then lived for the next twelve years. He made friends with the painters Filippo De Pisis and Felice Carena and with the collector Peggy Guggenheim. His first solo exhibition since the end of the war took place in Venice in 1948. His first post-war travels to the south of Italy – to Rome, Naples, Caserta, Positano and Capri – were made in 1949. It was in Positano that he met up again with Karli Sohn-Rethel and Stefan Andres. Recognition regained Max Peiffer Watenphul spent the whole month of April 1950 in Florence. In the same year Eberhard Hanfstaengl obtained an exhibition room for him at the Biennale, where his Venice paintings were shown. In autumn 1951 Peiffer Watenphul was granted a passport, enabling him to travel to Salzburg. The City of Salzburg placed a studio at his disposal in the Salzburger Künstlerhaus, which he kept until 1971. He met up again with Max Ernst and Jean Arp in Venice. Emilio Vedova, Giuseppe Santomaso, Carlo Cardazzo and the critic Bruno Alfieri counted among his many friends. Jean Cocteau wrote a foreword for his exhibitions. It was not until January 1952 that Peiffer Watenphul made his first visit to Germany since the end of the war: Essen, Dortmund, Wuppertal, Braunschweig, Munich were the cities on his itinerary before travelling on to Zürich. From 1952 onwards he took part regularly in the Grand Art Exhibitions at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and was for a long time a member of the Munich Secession. Encouraged by the Zürich gallery owner Chichio Haller (née Trillhaase), he produced his first colour lithographs. In 1952 he exhibited at the Folkwang Museum in Essen, the Museum am Ostwall in Dortmund and the Städtisches Museum in Wuppertal. On a visit to Paris in the spring of 1953 he was able to see many old friends again, including Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and Florence Henri. From 1954 he spent the spring and autumn months on the island of Ischia and the summer months in Salzburg, where, in 1956, he had a large and important exhibition at the Salzburg Residence. This was followed in 1957 by an exhibition on the premises of the Stuttgart Art Society showing 60 oil paintings, 40 watercolours and a large number of prints and drawings. In the autumn of 1957 Max Peiffer Watenphul bought a small studio in Rome, not far from the Piazza di Spagna. From his terrace he had an unobstructed view of the Pincio. In 1958/59 he took part in an exhibition at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni entitled Arte tedesca dal 1905 ad oggi. A comprehensive retrospective at the Municipal Art Museum of Leverkusen included both his early works and his Venice paintings. Rome Max Peiffer Watenphul took up permanent residence in Rome in 1958. During the 1960s he travelled to the south of Italy on many occasions. He made friends in Rome with the German correspondents Josef Schmitz van Vorst, Gustav René Hocke and Erich Kusch. In 1960 spent a month in Lebanon and, in 1961, visited Greece for the very first time. An exhibition mounted at the Kunsthalle in Kiel in 1961 emphasized the importance of his Venice and Rome paintings. Anna Peiffer, the artist's mother, died in Rome in February 1963. From 1964 Max Peiffer Watenphul travelled to the island of Corfu every year, where he usually rented a small apartment for the period from April to June. In 1964 he succeeded Kokoschka at the International Summer Academy in Salzburg and taught there for three months every year. In that same year he was awarded the Ring of Honour of the City of Salzburg. In 1965 he was appointed a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and, in the same year, exhibited his works from 1921 to 1964 at the Galleria La Medusa in Rome. His 70th birthday in 1966 was marked by exhibitions at the Otto Stangl Gallery in Munich and the Friedrich Welz Gallery in Salzburg. In November 1969 he was awarded the Great Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. His last painting was done in 1970; after that he produced only drawings, watercolours and lithographs. A retrospective took place at the Kunsthalle in Darmstadt in 1972, with 90 oil paintings and 60 watercolours.

Background  During the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590), the Ottoman military expenditures increased sharply. Meanwhile, state revenues began to decrease because of Jelali revolts in Anatolia. The result was a budget deficit. Murat III decided to devalue the coins. Between the reign of Suleyman the Magnificent and his grandson Murat, the value of a gold coin rose from 63 akçes (silver coin as the Ottoman monetary unit) to 120 akçes. The ensuing economic crisis hit the fixed income of the janissaries.  Rebellion  The janissaries revolted demanding a rise in their salary. They further asked for the execution of two Ottoman civil servants. One of them, Mahmut Efendi, was the chief treasurer (). The other one was Doğancı Mehmet Pasha, the beylerbey (high governor) of Rumeli who was accused of being the sultan's advisor in devaluation. Although the sultan initially tried to protect his prestige and two of his subordinates, he finally gave up. At the end of the negotiations, the salaries were increased and the two civil servants were sacrificed. They were immediately killed by the janissaries. The Grand Vizier Kanijeli Siyavuş Pasha was fortunate, for he was only dismissed from his post. Following the rebellion of jannisaries the sipahis also revolted demanding a rise in their salaries. But during the negotiations in the palace yard, an unidentified person in the crowd gave a command to attack the sipahis and the bostanjis (palace guards) caught sipahis off guard, killing about 400 of them. This ended the sipahi rebellion.Online history page  Istanbul riots  The Beylerbey incident was the first example of military revolts, in which civil servants were killed by soldiers. In the following years, a number of civil servants and even the sultan (Osman II) in one case, were killed in more serious riots by soldiers.

Twist (182?-1861) was possibly a Canadian native, a volunteer soldier in the Mexican American War in California, Sheriff of Santa Barbara County and captain of California Militia in Los Angeles. He was killed in action as a captain of artillery in the Mexican Army.  Early years in California  William W. Twist, described variously as a native of Nova Scotia History of Santa Barbara County, California, with illustrations and biographical sketches of its prominent men and pioneers, Thompson & West, Oakland, 1883 pp.78-87 or an American by birth,Horace Bell, Reminiscences of a Ranger: Early Times in Southern California, p.297 came to California from New York with Stevenson's Regiment during the Mexican American War.Bell, Reminiscences of a Ranger, p.288 Part of the garrison of Santa Barbara at the end of that war, he remained there afterward and married a Mexican woman. Sheriff of Santa Barbara County In 1852 William W. Twist was appointed Sheriff of Santa Barbara County but was later replaced by Valentine W. Hearne. Sheriff Hearne's part of the lynching of two Santa Barbara Californios accused of murder in Los Angeles, in the later San Gabriel Affair was not pleasing to Dr. Nicolas A. Den (owner of the Dos Pueblos Rancho) and the de la Guerras (an influential Californio ranchero family in the county), who were his principal sureties, they withdrew from his bonds, thus forcing him to resign. On August 10 Charles Fernald was appointed in his place. In the November 1852, election W. W. Twist, was elected to the office. Jesse D Mason. History of Santa Barbara county, California, with illustrations and biographical sketches of its prominent men and pioneers, Thompson & West, Oakland, 1883 pp.78-87  Arroyo Burro Incident  John Vidal, a Justice of the Peace and former Associate Justice with Joaquin Carrillo, and like Twist a former member the Stevenson Regiment garrison at Santa Barbara, had rented a tract of land on the Arroyo Burro, a small creek which runs into the ocean, west of Santa Barbara. When the lease expired he claimed the land under the preemption laws as Government land. This was a common tactic among those in the American population who were opposed to the large land holdings being held by the Californios and the Americans who had intermarried among them. Unlike Northern California, the Californios were in the majority in Southern California and especially in Santa Barbara County, and controlled the local courts. Suit was brought and the title judged to belong to Dr. Den, from whom Vidal had rented the land. Sheriff Twist was ordered by the courts to remove Vidal and put Den in possession. However Vidal had friends among the many gamblers in Santa Barbara including Jack Powers, which made dispossessing Vidal hazardous. People took sides depending on whether they favored the cause of the squatter and his gambler friends or the law-and-order party of la Guerra and the other Californio rancheros. Vidal's friends were gathered determined to hold the ground at all hazards. Vidal's partisans claimed that the presence of his friends at the Arroyo Burro was merely friendly and that no resistance to the law was contemplated. Twist no doubt disbelieved that claim and raised a posse to execute the writ of ejectment. About 200 men were enlisted in the posse and set to gather at the Egerea House (used as the County court house) and 9 o'clock the next morning before departure. A small cannon kept on the plaza, was to be taken and used if necessary to knock down any fortifications. A surgeon, was employed to accompany the force. Before the party had fully assembled that morning, Vidal and some of his companions came riding up. Two of his companions, one called \\"Little Mickey,\\" and the other a short, swarthy man almost covered with a serape, lassoed the cannon and attempted to drag it away.Mason, History, p.83 It was claimed Vidal rode up as if to commence the fight there. \\"Old residents differ materially as to the incidents. Some say that Vidal had come to avert the war or affect a compromise; that he stayed in town all night to answer a summons if need be; while others say that his whole party had come out from the fort that morning with the intention of capturing the cannon and thus break up the proposed attack. ... It is said that Mickey was drunk, and that this part of the affair was mere fun or bravado on his part.\\" Believing it was an attack, Twist fired at them, and firing immediately became general. Vidal was shot, and fell from his horse. The swarthy man in the serape rushed at Twist drawing a long knife from his belt and plunged it into him. Fortunately the knife was turned by a rib and the wound was not dangerous. Twist shot his assailant dead. A running fight then ensued, without any more casualties. The posse arrived at Arroyo Burro Canyon, to be met with a hail of bullets, and stopped short. After a brief negotiation, Powers informed the leader of the posse (Twist, injured, had stayed behind) that his gang would kill any man that passed a huge sycamore tree. Seeing that the bandits were dug in, well-armed, and determined, the posse backed away in defeat.Tompkins, Walker A. Santa Barbara, Past and Present. Tecolote Books, Santa Barbara, CA, 1975, p. 48 There was now serious talk of driving out the whole gang of \\"hounds,\\" as Powers Gang were sometimes called. It was likely that the slightest incident would trigger a war between the Powers gang and the la Guerra party. An emissary was sent to the squatter fort the next day with a flag of truce, and he induced Powers and the others who were with him to submit to the legal authorities, and the affair ended. The next morning the reason for their submission appeared in the shape of a ship-of-war anchored in the offing, requested by the de la Guerra's and dispatched by California Governor John Bigler, having sailed from Monterey the day before to enforce order if necessary. Vidal lived fourteen days before he died, without being able to speak, attended by the surgeon. Twist soon recovered. The land in dispute was afterwards judged to be public land. Jesse D Mason. History of Santa Barbara county, California, with illustrations and biographical sketches of its prominent men and pioneers, Thompson & West, Oakland, 1883 pp.82-84  Santa Barbara Guard  The Arroyo Burro Incident, had demonstrated the weakness of the civil authorities in the face of the Powers gang. Also raids of the Yokut from the San Joaquin Valley were also causing anxiety to the inhabitants in the county. In January 1854, upon the election of Sheriff Twist as Caprtain and E. B. Williams, First Lieutenant. Adjutant General William C. Kibbe immediately forwarded arms to their new California Militia unit the Santa Barbara Guard. However, Jack Powers soon eliminated the danger of Twist and his new militia to his gang. Shortly after the formation of the Guard, in February, 1854, Sheriff Twist was about to hang an Indian convicted of murder. A petition had been sent to Governor Bigler to have the sentence commuted to imprisonment for life and the reply was expected daily on the coastal steamer. On the day of execution no order for a mitigation of the sentence had been received, but when the Indian was about to be hanged, Jack Powers moved a stay of proceedings on the ground that the commutation of the sentence was probably on the steamer which was then overdue. The hanging was postponed on a vote of the spectators and the Governors order arrived on the steamer. Twist was much blamed for allowing this procedure by his political backers and his sureties were withdrawn from his bonds, compelling Twist to resign his office as Sheriff. He was replaced as Sheriff by Doctor Brinkerhoff, the County Coroner, until the Court appointed Russel Heath as Sheriff, later elected Sheriff in September 1855. After resigning his office as Sheriff, Twist moved to Los Angeles, tendering his resignation as Captain of the Santa Barbara Guard to Governor Bigler on September 21, 1854, and the unit now leaderless was disbanded after being in existence for less than a year, thus eliminating it as a danger to the Jack Powers Gang.  Los Angeles, Captain of Militia  Shortly after coming to live in Los Angeles, on February 3, 1855 Twist was elected Captain of the newly formed California Militia company, the Los Angeles Guard. It was raised to the fill the great need for help by the civil authorities in suppressing lawlessness, which was prevalent there at that time. In the latter part of February the company received their arms and accoutrements from the Adjutant General. California State Militia and National Guard Unit Histories, City Guard (Los Angeles), California State Military Department, The California Military Museum from www.militarymuseum.org accessed January 9, 2012 Among their duties Horace Bell, says Twist used his company in a traditional local Californio ceremony when he: > ... responded to the pious call of Father Anacleto, marched his company to > the plaza, and with Uncle Sam's muskets riddled Judas as effectually, as > well and as much to the satisfaction of all concerned as ever did the > christian soldiers of Spain and Mexico.

The volcano is not linked to any tectonic plates, the volcano is also in an area of very few earthquakes, suggesting that St. Andrew Strait is an Intraplate volcano. It consists of a group of Quaternary volcanic cones that are mainly rhyolitic in composition. The volcanism is curved, suggesting that the volcano has an ancient caldera. The centre of the volcano is Lou Island. Lou island last erupted in 240 BC (give or take 100 years) and 340 AD, both eruptions came from the Bendal volcano. Lou island is the largest eruptive centre of the volcano, with 6 volcanic vents. Also the Pam islands (Pam Lin and Pam Mandian) also contain fresh deposits. Historic eruptions have come from the Tuluman Islands. Eruptions 1880 eruption A small submarine eruption came from the Tulaman islands on March 28, 1880. The vent that the eruption came from was probably one of the vents that formed Tuluman island in its 1953-1957 eruption. This was a small VEI 2 explosive eruption. 1953-1957 eruption An eruption began June 27, 1953. The eruption began with submarine eruptions that formed a new island. The eruption came from 6 vents: *Vent 1. Located 1.3 km SSE of Lou Island. Emerged above the surface for two months, but was reduced to a submarine mound by wave action. *Vents 2,4,5. These three vents combined to form an island, 2 km south of Lou Island. The island reached a maximum length of 1 km. *Vent 3. Located 1.3 km south of Lou Island. The irregular shaped island reached a maximum length of 400 m. *Vent 6. Vent 6 is submerged and located 300 m south of vent 5. The eruptions were most intense in 1955 (and also near the end of the eruption) when lava effusion was dominant. The island was built 29 m above sea level. The eruption also produced tsunamis. The eruption was one of only 3 major rhyolitic eruptions of the 20th Century.

Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful Prime Minister drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the UK constitution. The independence of the judiciary has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the House of Lords or in the Cabinet. The court's ability to legislate through precedent, its inability to question validly enacted law through legislative supremacy and parliamentary sovereignty, and the role of the Europe-wide institutions to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system. Approach Although the United Kingdom recognises parliamentary sovereignty, writers have stressed the importance of the independence of the judiciary in establishing the rule of law, among them Trevor Allan.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81. The role of the separation of powers has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government. Albert Venn Dicey, writing in 1915 in Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution, described the separation of powers as \\"the offspring of a double misconception\\".Dicey (1915). p. 13. More recently Sir Ivor Jennings has argued that it is of little relevance, and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10. Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10-11. The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy - the creation of big government.Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191. This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of government, replaced with the concept of governance. This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the \\"executive\\" does.Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192. A similar approach is to take an approach of public choice theory. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the Committee on Standards in Public Life which applies the same rules to different organs, although their approach to judges is separate.Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11-12. Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192-193. Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12. However, Lord Mustill summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union:R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567. > It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers > that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and > largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to > make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the > administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it > by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed. Division between organs of parliament The UK Parliament creates law through the authority of the Queen-in-Parliament, securing the support of at least the House of Commons, and usually the House of Lords as well - although since the passing act of the Parliament Act 1911 this has not been necessary.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82. Under the European Communities Act 1972, the organs of the European Communities to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create primary legislation has also been devolved to Scottish and Welsh parliaments and to government ministers and local authorities to create secondary legislation. The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including local authorities) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as rubbish collections and the police.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83. The civil service remains non- partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195. The executive also exercises a number of powers under the Royal Prerogative, including foreign relations; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The Council and the Commission of the European Union also exercise executive power, as do devolved governments. Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected-non-elected divide: decision- makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194. The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196. The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through civil and criminal courts and a variety of tribunals. The Human Rights Act 1998 has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. The introduction of a tax is a legislative function; collecting tax is an executive and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is judicial review of executive decisions. However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails. The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87. Legislature and executive The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led Walter Bagehot to declare the \\"nearly complete fusion\\" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness. By convention, government ministers are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons. There is, however, a limit on their number. Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the Civil Service, the armed forces, and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers. The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy. When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 Select Committee report suggested:Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88. > The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in > favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our > parliamentary democracy. Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition complicated the party structure, since the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, served as Deputy Prime Minister under a Conservative Prime Minister. However, the legislature can render a government's position untenable through a vote of no confidence, as happened in 1979; on that occasion, as in 1924, a general election was called which the sitting government lost. This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms. Secondary legislation - where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an Act of Parliament - is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse. Executive and judiciary The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The Lord Chancellor, a member of the Cabinet is no longer a judge since the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The Attorney General (England and Wales) and the Lord Advocate (Scotland) have \\"quasi-judicial roles\\" but are part of the executive.Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88-89. In terms of control, the independence of the judiciary is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in superior courts cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in \\"good behaviour\\".Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89. Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of judicial review and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power. The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return. The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated. There remain problems with the scope of role of the Home Secretary in the penal system and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90. Nolan LJ, in M v Home Office, noted that:M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314. > The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is > that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful > province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as > to what its lawful province is. In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the Home Secretary must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker Gary McKinnon being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the Home Secretary announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide. Judiciary and legislature The judges of the Supreme Court do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as Law Lords formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No Member of Parliament may hold a full-time position in the judiciary. The departure of the judiciary from the House of Lords has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account. The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament. Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and legislative supremacy dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted primary legislation invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house. The European Communities Act 1972 placed a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90-91. Although the Human Rights Act 1998 allows the courts to make a declaration of incompatibility, they are required to interpret but may not disapply primary legislation.Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91. Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including exclusive cognisance), with the potential to cause conflict. However, R v Chaytor found that right to be limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.R v Chaytor; [2010] UKSC 52. the court thought it very unlikely that \\"the intention of Parliament\\" was to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way. The courts have also exercised a quasi- legislative power through precedent - for example, ending the marital rape exemption in R v R (Rape: marital exemption).R v R (Rape: marital exemption) [1992] 1 AC 599. There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary- legislature relationship.

It was first published in 1996 by Anglo- Saxon Books, and later republished in a revised edition in 2003. Divided into two parts, the first section of the book is devoted to a discussion of Anglo- Saxon paganism and magical beliefs, in doing so drawing evidence from Anglo- Saxon, Norse and Classical sources. It looks at a wide range of different areas, including the Anglo-Saxons conception of gods, the beliefs regarding death and the ancestors, and the ideas about elves and dwarves. Background The use of historical written sources to learn more about the pre-Christian religion of the Anglo-Saxons was something that had been going on for many decades prior to the publication of Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic. In 1948, Godfrid Storms published Anglo-Saxon Magic, a study of the subject which also contained a complete collection of Anglo-Saxon charms.Storms 1948. Synopsis Part One In the first chapter, entitled \\"The Up World\\", Griffiths discusses the Anglo-Saxons' pre-Christian beliefs about their gods, looking at the veneration of idols and the manner in which the deities were understood by the Anglo-Saxons, in doing so contrasting them with those of the Classical world.Griffiths 2003. pp. 11-22. Moving on into the second chapter, \\"The Dead World\\", Griffiths deals with the role of the ancestors in Anglo- Saxon heathenism before proceeding on to discuss beliefs in an afterlife and the reasons for performing sacrifice,Griffiths 2003. pp. 23-45. Chapter three, \\"The Around World\\", looks into the beliefs regarding those species who were neither god nor humans, such as the elves and dwarves, as well as the Anglo- Saxon magical beliefs regarding medicine and agriculture.Griffiths 2003. pp. 47-71. The fourth chapter, which is entitled \\"The Empty World\\", deals with those Anglo-Saxon texts which portray the supernatural world as \\"a bleak reality\\"”, looking at conceptions of predestination and fate,Griffiths 2003. pp. 73-79. whilst the fifth, entitled \\"The Rational World\\", dealt with the role of Anglo-Saxon Christianity and the wider effect that this had on English society, in particular discussing the significance of Bede,Griffiths 2003. pp. 81-93. Part Two The second part of the book contains a series of Anglo- Saxon texts pertaining to Anglo-Saxon magical practices. Reception and review Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic has not been the subject of any scholarly book reviews. The academic archaeologist Neil Price made reference to Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic in his study of Norse magical beliefs, The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia (2002). Praising Griffiths' approach in describing the \\"fluid ambiguities\\" of Anglo-Saxon cosmological beliefs, he considered such an approach to be an improvement on British archaeologist David M. Wilson's book Anglo-Saxon Paganism (1992), which he believed had failed to even discuss Anglo-Saxon conceptions of cosmology. Price thought that it was pertinent to \\"bear [Griffiths'] flexible view of the cosmos in mind\\" when studying Norse cosmological beliefs.Price 2002. pp. 110-111. Apart from these mentions in Neil Price's out-of-print PhD thesis, Griffith's book has not made any impact within scholarship in the fields of northern paganism or Anglo-Saxon studies. Writing on the Twisted Tree Bookshelf website, Contemporary Pagan D. James reviewed the book, praising it as a \\"comprehensive\\" study of the subject of Anglo-Saxon paganism and magic. Opining that it was a \\"ground breaking\\" study, James compared it to Brian Bates' The Way of Wyrd and recommended it to all practicing Pagans.James 2008.

He was born in Tynset as a son of farmers Embret Thoresen Myrvang (1828–1884) and Gisken Krogseng (1829–1922). He took teacher's education at Hamar Seminary in 1877, and was a teacher in Stor-Elvdal until 1916. He also owned the farm Westgård from 1896. From 1911 to 1915 he was the acting school director of the Diocese of Hamar, being a substitute for Olav Andreas Eftestøl who was an MP. Myrvang served as mayor of Stor-Elvdal from 1901 to 1904, 1913 to 1916 and 1922 to 1925. During the last period he also chaired the county council (which was composed of mayors). He then represented the Labour Democrats, which he joined after the split from the Liberal Party. For both these parties, he served a total of six terms in the Parliament of Norway. The first five terms were continuous, with Myrvang winning elections in 1894, 1897, 1900, 1903 and 1906. On the latter occasion, the system with single-member constituencies had been implemented, and Myrvang won because he gathered the social democratic vote. In 1912 he was elected as the deputy of Olav Andreas Eftestøl in Søndre Østerdalen, whereas in 1915 he was elected to his sixth and last term, with K. K. Sanaker as his deputy. In 1918, the last election with single-member constituencies, he lost to Johan Bondesen, social democrat from Stor-Elvdal. In 1921 Myrvang headed the party ballot in the plural-member constituency Hedmark, whereas in 1924 he was the second candidate on a joint list with the Liberal Party, both times without being elected. Among his other posts, Myrvang chaired the county school board of Hedmark from 1924 to 1930, and also chaired the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union.

The term is largely used when referring collectively to Central Norway and Northern Norway. Until around 1800 the name also included all of Western Norway. The largest city is Trondheim, with the Trondheim Region having a population of 260,000. Historically, an administrative division of Norway in Sønnenfjells and Nordenfjells has been used from the Middle Ages until around 1800. The border between the two regions was a range from Åna-Sira or Lindesnes, northwards along Langfjella and Dovrefjell. What is today known as Western Norway (Vestlandet) was defined as part of Nordenfjells.Imsen, S. and Winge, H. (eds.): Norsk historisk leksikon, Cappelen Akademisk Forlag, Second edition, 1999 The notion of Western Norway was introduced in the 1800s. Erik Pontoppidan was one of the first to use the notion of vestenfields (west of the mountains) as distinct part of Nordenfjells. Pontoppidan observed the notable differences in climate between east and west. Later William Thrane wrote that western Norway included most of Christiansand dicose (Agder, Rogaland and western Telemark). Hans Strøm used the old distinction where «nordenfjells» included western Norway. Christopher Hansteen travelled across Hardangervidda in 1821 and observed that his compassed apparently had a 90° deviation: People in Eastern Norway said they traveled \\"north\\" to Hardanger and people from the west were known as \\"nordmenn\\". Christian Magnus Falsen in 1822 used Vestlandet about Agder and Jæren. Ivar Aasen's dictionary from 1850 og 1873 use vestlending og Vestlandet as these names are used today.Helle, Knut: «Ei soge om Vestlandet». Chapter 1, volume 1 of Vestlandets historie (edited by Knut Helle).

Ohthere of Hålogaland used these names in his report to King Alfred in year 890. When the kingdom expanded the old labels nordmenn and nordenfjells were still used about the coastal/fjord areas in the west while the eastern areas, Østlandet, were inhabited by austmenn (eastern men).Orning, Hans Jacob: «En vestlandskonge?» Klassekampen, 18. februar 2013.

Biography Birth Yuknoom was born on September 11, 600. His parents were possibly king Scroll Serpent and his wife, Lady Scroll-in-hand. Reign As he acceded in AD 636 and his successor followed him upon the throne in 686, Yuknoom the Great is known to have ruled the Kaan kingdom for fifty years during the height of its power and ascendency over Tikal.Martin and Grube 2008:108 He took the name of the Early Classic king Yuknoom Chʼeen I upon his accession. As Tikal was showing strong signs of recovering from the defeat of its king Wak Chan Kʼawiil almost one hundred years earlier, Yuknoom exerted himself against Kaan's great rival; he accomplished this in the context of a division in Tikal's dynastic line whereby both Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil of Dos Pilas and his probable brother (or half-brother) Nuun Ujol Chaak of Tikal came to style themselves holy lords of Mutal. The initial circumstances of the relationship between Dos Pilas and Tikal are murky, but in 650 Bajlaj Chan Kʼawiil was attacked and driven from his city, and he came to acknowledge the Snake ruler as his overlord and ally in the factional dispute with Tikal. In 657 Yuknoom Chʼeen turned his attention to Tikal and vanquished it in a \\"star war\\" encounter, as a consequence of which Nuun Ujol Chaak must have pledged some form of fealty, because both he and Bajlaj Chan Kʼawiil subsequently attended a ritual performed by Calakmul prince Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ. But then in 672 the Tikal king asserted his independence by ousting Bajlaj Chan Kʼawiil from Dos Pilas and pursuing him as he sought refuge at other sites. Calakmul then intervened in 677 and dealt Nuun Ujol Chaak a second defeat, which was followed in 679 by a decisive vanquishment at the hands of Dos Pilas, almost certainly with Calakmul aid. The following year brought turmoil to another region of Kaan's hegemony; Naranjo, which had defected from its vassal status after the death of Aj Wosal Chan Kʼinich and had been punished by the defeat of its thirty-sixth ruler, had recovered sufficiently for the thirty-seventh to attack Kaan's client Caracol. Retribution seems to have followed swiftly, however, as the royal lineage of Naranjo was terminated within two years, ultimately to be replaced by the grandson of Bajlaj Chan Kʼawiil. Yuknoom Chʼeen's superordinate status was recognized in inscriptions at a number of sites, while it is probable that a great many other such mentions are lost to us. He sponsored three generations of Cancuen rulers and oversaw the accessions of two of them in 656 and 677. And far to the west of Calakmul, the accession of a king at Moral-Reforma in 662 took place under the auspices of Kaan, an event apparently coordinated with an attack by Piedras Negras on Moral-Reforma's neighbor Santa Elena that same year — an inscription at Piedras Negras mentions Calakmul six days before this event. An emissary of Yuknoom Chʼeen also supervised a ritual at Piedras Negras in 685. Yuknoom the Great was well into his eighties when he died, and it is likely that many of the successes of his later years were actually the achievements of his successor, Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ.Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens by Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube (2008:56-57, 74-75, 94-95, 108-9) Relations with La Corona were enhanced when a daughter of Yuknoom Chʼeen married a lord of that site in 679.

Following line-up changes, such as the addition of drummer Josh Pickett, bassist Stephen Minter, and Duce becoming the band's frontman,Patashnik 2013, p. 61 they began working on what would become their first EP, Bretton. Duce taught himself how to sing and play guitar at the same time while playing along to the band's Demo 2007 release.Patashnik 2013, p. 62 Bretton was released in December 2008. Partway through the touring cycle for the EP, the band had further line-up changes. In June 2009, the band toured with We Stare at Mirrors. Through this tour, drummer Eddy Thrower met Duce and Sansom. We Stare at Mirrors bassist Declan Hart \\"thought Lower Than Atlantis were meth-heads. Their reputation was just mental.\\" Luke Sansom re-joined on bass, before leaving a second time. Composition and recording While at university, Duce wrote the majority of songs that would feature on Far Q, which were later credited to the band as a whole. Duce wrote about his life experiences in Watford, such as working on building sites, going to the pub and relationships. \\"Eating Is Cheating\\" features references to bars and clubs in Watford. Ben Patashnik of Rock Sound described the album as taking \\"their first steps into more melodic territory\\", while at the same time keeping \\"the hard, gritty edge\\" of Bretton. The album's sound has been described as melodic hardcore, post-hardcore, and punk rock. Shortly afterwards, the pair found themselves without a drummer. Duce called Sansom, asking \\"Why does everyone keep leaving [the band]?!\\". They soon remember drummer Eddy Thrower from We Stare at Mirrors. They called him, asking he if would like to partake in a practice session. Thrower, who was unhappy with his time at university and with the band he was in, accepted the offer. Thrower fit in quickly, resulting in the trio writing \\"Far Q\\". Duce explained the band \\"never worked with a good drummer before. [With Thrower, i]t was... nice.\\" Duce and Sansom previously created demos with programmed drums. Thrower initially learned the songs as they were but began changing the drum parts after a few practices. He used a double bass pedal for a lot of fills.Chamberlain 2012, p. 60 Far Q was recorded in a room above a printing factory in Hertfordshire between September and October 2009. The band were originally supposed to be on tour during September and October, but had to cancel plans when their bass player left. The album was produced by Daniel Lancaster, who also engineered and mixed it. The band had known Lancaster since they formed. Lancaster would constantly push Thrower to get a good drum sound to the extent where he was screaming in Thrower's face. Duce played bass on the album while Lancaster has guest vocals on \\"A/S/L?\\". The album was mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music in New Windsor, New York in November. Release On 14 February 2010, \\"I'm Not Bulimic (I Just Wanted to See How Far I Could Stick My Fingers Down My Throat)\\" was made available for streaming via the band's Myspace profile. The music video for \\"Taping Songs Off the Radio\\" was released on 17 February, and the song released as a single on 1 March with \\"I'm Not Bulimic (I Just Wanted to See How Far I Could Stick My Fingers Down My Throat)\\" as the B-side. Far Q was released on 29 March 2010 through independent label A Wolf at Your Door Records. German label Redfield released a mediabook edition of the CD and a vinyl version of the album; the mediabook was limited to 1,000 copies while the vinyl was limited to 500 copies. The album's artwork was created by Alex Gregory and Jon Bamby. The pair also contributed the design, while Gregory provided photography and Bamby did the layout. Due to their frequent line-up changes in the past, the band's initial plan was to have temporary bass players. However, shortly after the release of Far Q, Declan Hart joined the group. Hart, who was a guitarist at the time, subsequently purchased a bass. Previously, the band frequently gave Hart a lift to places. Duce explained, Hart \\"would show up, drink all our rider and get wasted. We were like, 'We like this guy!'\\" Around this time, the group were having problems with their label. Hart explained: \\"They didn't understand us or what we were doing. We had a punk ethic\\". In addition, the members quit their jobs and began to focus on the band full-time. Lower Than Atlantis supported I Am Ghost on their tour of the UK in May. The band toured the UK between June and August. The music video for \\"Far Q\\" was released on 6 July, and the single was released on 19 July with \\"Mike Duce's Symphony No.11 in D Minor\\" as the B-side. The band toured with TRC on the This Is England Tour in September. The band toured the UK as part of Rock Sound Presents...

As part of their 2019 3-date farewell tour, the band released 300 limited edition vinyl pressings of the album (100 per night). Reception and legacy Far Q was critically acclaimed upon release. Alter the Press! reviewer Sean Reid said Far Q was the band's attempt at standing out in a big pool of other UK hardcore bands. Reid noted that the album is \\"Filled with energy and passion\\" from the beginning and are able to show their honesty with \\"social[ly]-aware lyrics\\".

First published by Sussex Academic Press in 2003, the book presented Wilby's theory that the beliefs regarding familiar spirits found among magical practitioners - both benevolent cunning folk and malevolent witches - reflected evidence for a general folk belief in these beings, which stemmed from a pre-Christian visionary tradition. Building on the work of earlier historians such as Carlo Ginzburg, Éva Pócs and Gabór Klaniczay, all of whom argued that Early Modern beliefs about magic and witchcraft were influenced by a substratum of shamanistic beliefs found in pockets across Europe, in Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits, Wilby focuses in on Britain, using the recorded witch trial texts as evidence to back up this theory. The book is divided into three parts, each of which expand on a different area of Wilby's argument; the first details Wilby's argument that familiar spirits were a concept widely found among ordinary magical practitioners rather than being an invention of demonologists conducting witch trials. The second then proceeds to argue that these familiar spirits were not simply a part of popular folklore, but reflected the existence of a living visionary tradition, which was shamanistic and pre-Christian in origin. Finally, in the third part of the book, Wilby looks at the significance of this tradition for Britain's spiritual heritage. Reviews of the book published in specialist academic journals were mixed, with some scholars supporting and others rejecting Wilby's theory, although all noted the importance of such a work for witchcraft studies. Wilby meanwhile would go on to expand her theory by focusing it in on the case of the accused witch Isobel Gowdie for her second book, The Visions of Isobel Gowdie: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern British Witchcraft and Magic (2010), also published by Sussex Academic Press. Background Historical research Prior to Wilby's work, the English historian Owen Davies had researched the role of the cunning folk in Early Modern Britain, culminating in the publication of his 2003 book Cunning- Folk: Popular Magic in English History.Davies 2003. Davies had rejected the idea that there had been any shamanistic traditions among the cunning folk of Britain, and furthermore argued that the Early Modern cunning tradition should not be seen as being a continuation of a pre-Christian practice, relating that \\"to emphasise their pagan roots is about as meaningful or meaningless as pointing out the pagan origins of early modern potting.\\"Davies 2003. pp. 177-186. From the 1930s onward, various historians studying the witch trials on continental Europe had begun arguing that in some areas, the image of the witch had been influenced by underlying local folklore about visionary journeys. Poc's book on Hungarian witchcraft and magic appeared in her native language in 1997, before being published in an English translation in 1999 as Between the Living and the Dead. Wilby and her research At the time of writing, Wilby had done some part-time teaching at Exeter University, although was essentially performing the research in her capacity as an independent scholar. Wilby's unpublished work came to the attention of the historian Ronald Hutton of Bristol University, a specialist in Early Modern Britain, who would later note that he \\"gave it all the help that I could, in making suggestions for improvement to the manuscript, encouraging a publisher, and writing an endorsement\\", believing that Wilby had \\"repaid my faith richly with the result.\\"Hutton 2010. p. 250. Synopsis Wilby opens her book with a transcript from the trial of the cunning woman Bessie Dunlop, which took place in Edinburgh in 1576, in the midst of the Early Modern witch trials. Dunlop had been accused of \\"Sorcery, Witchcraft and Incantation, with Invocation of spirits of the devil\\", found guilty, and executed through strangulation.Wilby 2005. pp. viii-xv. Part One The first part of Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits is devoted to a historical examination of the professional cunning folk and accused witches of Early Modern Britain, with a particular focus on the beliefs in familiar spirits that they held to; according to Wilby, this serves the purpose of \\"illustrat[ing] in some detail, the event-pattern, emotional dynamics, and social context of the alleged familiar-encounter, and secondly to illustrate how encounter-narratives were not merely élite fictions, that is, the result of learned prosecutors superimposing their demonological preconceptions onto cunning folk and witches, but were rooted in folk belief and came, in significant part, from the magical practitioners themselves.\\"Wilby 2005. pp. 6-7. After laying out the basis of her argument in the book's introduction,Wilby 2005. pp. 3-7. Wilby starts by giving a context for the world of Early Modern Britain, which was for the common people an unceasingly poor and traumatic place, filled with folk beliefs about magic, religion, animism, and fairies of both Christian and pre-Christian origin.Wilby 2005. pp. 8-25. For the sake of discussion, she simplifies the various contemporary terms for folk magic practitioners into two types: cunning folk, who generally perform beneficial magic, and witches, who generally perform harmful magic, also known as maleficium, and she explains the types of services each typically provided, often for others in exchange for goods or services.Wilby 2005. pp. 26-45. Wilby also condenses the various types of spirits that assist magic practitioners into two categories: familiar spirits for cunning folk and demon familiars for witches.Wilby 2005. pp. 46-58. Drawing from the many trial records of those accused of witchcraft during this period, she illustrates the ways that magic practitioners first meet their familiars,Wilby 2005. pp. 59-76. the types of working relationships they might have,Wilby 2005. pp. 77-91. the demands made by familiars (such as the renunciation of Christianity),Wilby 2005. pp. 92-111. and the morally ambiguous space that cunning folk and witches occupied in society.Wilby 2005. pp. 112-120. Part Two The second part of the book proceeds to lay out the case that the encounters with familiar spirits recorded by those investigating cunning folk and alleged witches did not simply reflect \\"accumulations of folk belief\\" but that instead they offer real \\"descriptions of visionary experiences - actual psychic events which occurred in historical time and geographical space\\" which \\"could be interpreted as evidence that popular shamanistic visionary traditions, of pre-Christian origin, survived in many parts of Britain during the early modern period.\\"Wilby 2005. p. 7. Wilby turns to anthropological methods to make this point: since little to no evidence of pre-Christian beliefs in Britain exist, she looks at other indigenous shamanic traditions—namely Siberian and Native American, modeled after the anthropological work of Alan Macfarlane and Keith Thomas.Wilby 2005. pp. 123-127. She details the ways in which shamans of these cultures meet their spirit guides, form a working relationship together, invoke them, and build intimate, fulfilling relationships together that can last for decades, all while drawing parallels to the customs of Early Modern British cunning folk and witches that she laid out in part one.Wilby 2005. pp. 128-145. She points out that in addition to similaries in practicies, there are also similarities in beliefs: both believe in a spirit world that exists separately from our own and that magic practitioners can travel there, but that they must do so carefully because if a human's soul gets trapped there, their body will die.Wilby 2005. pp. 146-159. Part Three The third and final part of Wilby's study deals with what she describes as \\"the possible spiritual significance of these traditions,\\" which includes the argument that these encounters with familiars were actually mystical experiences. She reviews the ways that scholars have looked at the ontology of familiar encounters, which often include the belief that they were partly or wholly fiction, as opposed to the contemporary writings that treated them as real events. Specifically, she analyzes the nature of European witches' sabbaths, whether they were \\"empiracally real events\\" or \\"illusory\\" ones; both contemporary writers and present day scholars have puzzled over this question, and Carlo Ginzburg suggested a new option in 1989: that these events were \\"evidence of the survival of ritual trance experiences derived from pre-Christian Eurasian shamanism\\".Wilby 2005. pp. 165-168. Wilby argues that the familiars themselves might have been the result of the same phenomenon. Even though scholars thus far had not explored that possibility because trial transcripts did not support this claim, she points out that shamans of all cultures typically have difficulty talking about their experiences. She also points out direct evidence of trance-inducing techniques used in witches' sabbaths and indirect evidence of it used in invoking familiars.Wilby 2005. pp. 168-184. Wilby notes the various ways that scholars have \\"pathologized\\" these familiar encounters by describing them as fantasies and mental illnesses, not unlike the way scholars once analyzed shamanistic beliefs. Scholars now believe that shamans provide a benefit to their society, and even describe their experiences as mystical. Ken Wilber theorized that there are ten \\"levels of consciousness\\", of which the top four can be described as \\"transcendent\\". Roger Walsh built on this work by showing that shaman's visionary experiences fit into the eighth level, called the \\"subtle\\" level, also citing the work of Carl Jung that describes them as \\"real\\" experiences.Wilby 2005. pp. 185-198. Learned magicians of the period who practiced \\"high magic\\" have been recognized as having mystical experiences, so Wilby provides some reasons that scholars may have treated common magic practitioners differently: these practitioners were illiterate and therefore never recorded their experiences, they were intimidated by crowded courtrooms during witch trials, they sometimes used methods of deception that our culture would term quackery, they didn't conform to today's preconceptions of mysticism that we inherited from Christianity, and there was a large gulf between the way they experienced the world versus scholars of today—the last point being elucidated by Ananda Coomaraswamy's claim that our society suffers from \\"imaginal illiteracy\\" which prevents our mind from forming images in the same was as illiterate peoples.Wilby 2005. pp. 199-217. Wilby draws parallels between the cunning folk and witches to Christian contemplatives whose status as mystics is taken as historical fact, including Margery Kempe, Walter Hilton, Teresa of Ávila, Bridget of Sweden, Hadewijch, and Christina Ebner.Wilby 2005. pp. 218-242. She discusses research that claims mystic experiences are innate to the human condition, and that a percentage of people are naturally predisposed to experience them, but explains that everyday conditions in Early Modern Britain which are much less present in our society today—malnutrition, grief, darkness, hallucinogenic poisoning, and animist beliefs—are many of the same conditions that tend to induce mystical experiences, and are often practiced as part of shamanistic traditions. Wilby concludes by saying that although these folk magic beliefs and practices have mostly been lost to history, they contain an essential human truth evidenced by the recent resurgence of magical practices, such as neo-paganism.Wilby 2005. pp. 243-257. Arguments Familiar-spirits as folk tradition The first part of Wilby's argument in Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits is that the accounts of encounters with familiar spirits and journeys to other worlds were not invented by those elite figures who oversaw the witch trials, but that they were actually provided by ordinary folk themselves. Existence of a British visionary tradition Visionary tradition as pre-Christian survival As a further extension of her argument, Wilby puts forward her case that this Early Modern visionary tradition is actually a survival from before the arrival of Christianity. Reviews and reception Academic reviews In her ordinary review of the book published in Folklore, the journal of the Folklore Society, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson described Wilby's theories as \\"bold stuff\\", but argued that while \\"I found her theory stimulating\\", she did not think that it was \\"wholly convincing\\". Simpson noted that there \\"are too many places where the inevitable shortage of evidence is circumvented by that familiar device, the argument that although we cannot prove X, neither can we prove not-X, so let us assume X.\\" Continuing with her critique, Simpson also disagreed with Wilby's distinction between the \\"fairy familiars\\" of cunning folk and the \\"demon familiars\\" of witches, noting that the distinction broke down upon further scrutiny, and that as such the very inclusion of this distinction had been \\"unnecessarily laborious\\". Writing in the journal Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft, the historian Marion Gibson of the University of Exeter was more positive, calling Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits \\"bold, yet careful and intellectually rigorous\\", praising Wilby's inclusion of Bessie Dunlop's original trial records and ultimately relating that \\"This is by far the most persuasive account of such a [mystic] \\"tradition\\" that I have read. It avoids sloppy thinking and overstatement in a way that is rare and very creditable. It is exciting and fulfilling in its own right without needing to make unprovable claims. Optimistically and humanely, it makes its strong case for a British shamanic tradition. Whether readers agree with Wilby's conclusions or not, this is a very important book.\\" Wider reception In an article written for The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies, the historian Ronald Hutton, who had aided Wilby in editing her manuscript and finding a publisher, noted his belief that Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits was \\"so important\\" for witchcraft studies because it dealt \\"directly with the possible relations between the people concerned and a spirit world\\", something which recent British scholarship in the field had tended to avoid. Believing that \\"[n]obody had done anything like this before\\", Hutton did however admit to some criticisms, relating that \\"I think some of her suggestions more speculative than others, and (as she knows) I worry a bit about her selective use of widely scattered examples of what can be called shamanism taken from other parts of the world. This, however, does nothing to diminish my enthusiasm for her work.\\" Wilby's work also proved an influence on the historian Joyce Froome in her study of the Pendle witches, Wicked Enchantments (2010).

It is owned by Goodman Properties and Managed by 6711 Glen Burnie Retail, LLC a subsidiary of LNR Property Inc. The Property has now been turned into a Shopping Center with The Following anchors; Burlington, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, and Target. History The center opened in 1963 as the Glen Burnie Mall, the third shopping mall developed by Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.. At the time of its opening it had Montgomery Ward as an anchor as well as an A&P; grocery store, a G.C. Murphy variety store and a single-screen movie theater. The mall's second anchor, a Topps Discount City (a division of Interstate Department Stores) was dedicated in March 1969. This store was shuttered in late 1974. Toys \\"R\\" Us (another Interstate division) opened a store in the Topps space, as did Baltimore-based Epstein's department store. Toys \\"R\\" Us closed in 2018 due to bankruptcy. Half of the Topps space that was occupied by Toys \\"R\\" Us became an Ollie’s Bargain Outlet in 2018. The half of the former Topps was once occupied by Best Buy, which moved across the street in 2010 and the space was converted into H. H. Gregg in 2011, which closed in 2017 and Office Depot, which closed in 2019, and the space is still vacant. A fire damaged the north end of the mall on October 24, 1981. The center, except for Montgomery Ward, was closed while renovations could be completed. The mall re- opened in November 1982. Montgomery Ward went out of business in 2000. In 2002, the mall was sold to Petrie Ventures, which announced plans to tear down the vacant Wards store and built a new Target discount store. The mall also underwent extensive renovations that added outward-facing retail bays. In 2005, the mall was renamed as Centre at Glen Burnie. In 2012, Jones Lang LaSalle was named leasing agent and manager of the center. The property was transferred on March 14, 2016 from the legal entity BACM 2006-5 Ritchie Highway LLC to one known as 6711 Glen Burnie Retail LLC for a book amount of $15M. Both LLC's are, in turn, ultimately owned by Starwood Property Trust LLC in Greenwich, CT. Starwood owns the property through its $1.05 billion acquisition of LNR Property LLC and its subsidiary LNR Partners LLC of Miami, FL in 2013. Shopping center In 2017, Renovations were underway to the Centre At Glen Burnie to become an outdoor strip Mall. A movie theater is Planned. Anchors are Burlington, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, and Target. Also, Toys \\"R\\" Us closed their store as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As of 2019, Office Depot is closing and Spirit Halloween opens seasonally in the former Hhgregg.

Anthropogenic climate change is already a reality in Africa, as it is elsewhere in the world.

The risks of climate change on agricultural production, food security, water resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa.Niang, I., O.C.

Over the coming decades, warming from climate change is expected across almost all the Earth's surface, and global mean rainfall will increase. Regional effects on rainfall in the tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable and the sign of change at any one location is often less certain, although changes are expected. Consistent with this, observed surface temperatures have generally increased over Africa since the late 19th century to the early 21st century by about 1 °C, but locally as much as 3 °C for minimum temperature in the Sahel at the end of the dry season. Observed precipitation trends indicate spatial and temporal discrepancies as expected. The observed changes in temperature and precipitation vary regionally. In terms of adaptation efforts, regional-level actors are making some progress. This includes the development and adoption of several regional climate change adaptation strategies e.g. SADC Policy Paper Climate Change, and the adaptation strategy for the water sector. In addition, there has been other efforts to enhance climate change adaptation, such as the tripatite Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA-EAC-SADC). As a supranational organization of 55 member states, the African Union has put forward 47 goals and corresponding actions in a 2014 draft report to combat and mitigate climate change on the continent. The Secretary General of the United Nations has also declared a need for close cooperation with the African Union in order to tackle climate change, in accordance with the UN's sustainable development goals.  Impacts  Climate change will increasingly impact Africa due to many factors. These impacts are already being felt and will increase in magnitude if action is not taken to reduce global carbon emissions. The impacts include higher temperatures, drought, changing rainfall patterns and increased climate variability. These conditions have a bearing on energy production and consumption. The recent drought in many African countries, which has been linked to climate change, adversely affected both energy security and economic growth across the continent.  Agriculture and food security  Agriculture is inherently sensitive to climate conditions and is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the risks and impacts of global climate change. Agriculture in most African countries is mainly small-scale and rain-fed, making it particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change. Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in many parts of Africa. Furthermore, the agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and the resources to adapt. Climate variability and change have been and continue to be, the principal source of fluctuations in global food production in countries of the developing world where production is highly rain-dependent. The agriculture sector is sensitive to climate variability, especially the inter-annual variability of precipitation, temperature patterns, and extreme weather events (droughts and floods). These climatic events are predicted to increase in the future and are expected to have significant consequences to the agriculture sector. This would have a negative influence on food prices, food security, and land-use decisions. Yields from rainfed agriculture in some African countries could be reduced by up to 50% by 2020. In order to prevent the future destructive impact of climate variability on food production, it is crucial to adjust or suggest possible policies to cope with increased climate variability. African countries need to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with the anticipated climate variability. However, before devising a policy to cope with the impacts of climate variability, especially to the agriculture sector, it is critical to have a clear understanding of how climate variability affects different food crops. In the year 2020, sever invasion of Locusts harmed the agriculture in eastern Africa. The invasion is at least partly due to climate change - the warmer temperature and heavier rainfall caused an abnormal increase in the number of locusts  Water resources  Water quality and availability have deteriorated in most areas of Africa particularly due to climate change. Previous research and climate projections provide enough evidence that water resources are vulnerable and have the possibility of being strongly impacted by climate change with vast ramifications on human societies. The IPCC predicts millions of people in Africa will persistently face increased water stress due to climate variability and change (IPCC 2013). Changes in precipitation patterns directly affect surface runoff and water availability. Any changes to the hydrological cycle may have significant effects on river basins of Africa. To improve understanding of past and future changes in water availability due to climate change, the IPCC (IPCC 2013) recommends using the dynamic downscaling technique. The IPCC 2013 proposed using the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models which runs at a maximum of 50 km resolutions, the resolution used depends upon the size of the watershed and area coverage by the meteorological records. However, before using the climate simulations from the dynamic downscaling, it is appropriate to evaluate their performance at different spatial scales since their performance differs from one location to another and from one RCM to another.  Health  African countries have the least efficient public health systems in the world.World Health Organization. (2014). The health of the people: what works: the African Regional Health Report 2014. World Health Organization. Infectious disease burdens such as malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue fever, meningitis, which are sensitive to climate impacts, are highest in the sub-Saharan African region. For instance, over 90 percent of annual global malaria cases are in Africa. Changes in climate will affect the spread of infectious agents as well as alter people’s disposition to these infections.  Energy  With increasing population and corresponding energy demand, energy security must be addressed because energy is crucial for sustainable development. Climate change has affected energy sectors in Africa as many countries depend on hydropower generation. Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower water levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation. This has resulted in low electrical energy production, high cost of electricity and power outages or load-shedding in some African countries that depend on hydroelectric power generation. Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania. Regional differences  Central Africa Central Africa, for the most part, is landlocked and is geographically threatened by climate change. Due to its high climate variability and rainfed agriculture, Central Africa is expected to experience longer and more frequent heatwaves as well as an increase in wet extremes. The global mean temperature in this region is to increase by 1.5 °C to 2 °C.Seneviratne S I, Donat MG, Pitman AJ, Knutti R and Wilby R L 2016 Allowable CO2 emissions based on regional and impact-related climate targets Nature 529 477–83 Central Africa Adaption Measures Angola - \\"The objective of the National Adaptation Programs of Action are to identify and communicate the urgent and immediate needs of the country regarding climate change adaptation, to increase Angola‘s resilience to climate variabilities and to climate change to ensure achievement of Poverty reduction programs, sustainable development objectives and the Millennium Development Goals pursued by the Government.\\" Effects The carbon dioxide-absorbing capacity of forests in the Congo Basin have decreased. This decrease has occurred due to increasing heat and drought causing decreased tree growth. This suggests that even unlogged forests are being affected by climate change. A Nature study indicates that by 2030, the African jungle will absorb 14 percent less carbon dioxide than it did from around 2005-2010, and will absorb none at all by 2035. Eastern Africa Situated almost entirely in the tropics, rainfall in Eastern Africa is dominated by the seasonal migration of the tropical-rain band. Eastern Africa is characterized by high spatio-temporal rainfall variability as it spans over 30 degrees of latitude (across the equator). It has influences from both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and has major orographic features (highlands) as well as inland water bodies such as Lake Victoria. Therefore the rainfall seasonality varies from a single wet season per year in July–August in parts of the northwest (including Ethiopia and South Sudan, which are meteorologically more connected to West Africa, with the West African monsoon bringing the rains) to a single wet season per year in December - February in the south (over Tanzania), with many areas close to the equator having two rainy seasons per year, approximately in March–May (the “Long Rains”) and October to December (the “Short Rains”). Fine-scale variability in rainfall seasonality is often linked to orography and lakes. Inter-annual variability can be large and known controls include variations in Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of different ocean basins, large-scale atmospheric modes of variability such as the Madden-Julian Osciliation (MJO) and tropical cyclones. Eastern Africa has witnessed frequent and severe droughts in recent decades, as well as devastating floods. Trends in rainfall since the 1980s show a general decrease in March - May (MAM) seasonal rains with a slight increase during June - September (JJAS) and October - December (OND) rains, although there appears to have been a recent recovery in the MAM rains. In the future, both rainfall and temperature are projected to change over Eastern Africa. Recent studies on climate projections suggest that average temperature might increase by about 2-3 °C by the middle of the century and 2-5 °C at the end of the century. This will depend on emission scenarios as well as on how the real climate responds compared with the range of possible outcomes shown by models. Climate model projections tend to show an increase in rainfall, particularly during OND season, which is also projected to occur later. This delay in the short rain season, has been linked to the deepening of the Saharan Heat Low under climate change. It should be noted, however that some models predict decreasing rainfall, and for some regions and seasons the very largest rainfall increases predicted have been shown to involve implausible mechanisms due to systematic model errors. In addition, changes of aerosols provide a forcing of rainfall change that is not captured in many assessments of climate projections. The contrast of the drying trend of MAM (long rains) rainfall in equatorial Eastern Africa, with most models predicting a wetting in the future has been labelled the “East African climate change paradox,\\" although there has been some recent recovery in the rainfall. Studies have shown that the drying trend is unlikely to be purely natural, but may be driven by factors such as aerosols rather than greenhouse gases, further research is needed. The drying has been shown to be have been caused by a shorter rainy season, and linked to deepening of the Arabian Heat Low. Consistent with the uncertainty in rainfall projections, changes in rainy seasons onset are uncertain in equatorial Eastern Africa, although many models predict a later and wetter short rains. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is known to provide a strong control on inter-annual variability in the short rains, and studies show that extreme IODs may increase under climate change. Globally, climate change is expected to lead to intensification of rainfall, as extreme rainfall increases at a faster rate with warming than total rainfall does. Recent work shows that across Africa global models are expected to under-estimate the rate of change of this rainfall intensification, and changes in rainfall extremes may be much more widespread than those predicted by global models. Southern parts of Eastern Africa receive most of their rainfall in a single rainy season during the southern hemisphere’s winter: over Tanzania seasonal rainfall is projected to increase under future climate change, although there is uncertainty. Further south, over Mozambique, a shorter season due to a later onset is projected under future climate change, again with some uncertainty. East Africa Adaption Measures Comoros - \\"NAPA is the operational extension of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), as it includes among its adaptation priorities, agriculture, fishing, water, housing, health, but also tourism, in an indirect way, through the reconstitution of basin slopes and the fight against soils erosion, and therefore the protection of reefs by limiting the silting up by terrigenous contributions.\\" Kenya gazetted the Climate Change Act, 2016 which establishes an authority to oversee development, management, implementation and regulation of mechanisms to enhance climate change resilience and low carbon development for sustainable development, by the National and County Governments, the private sector, civil society, and other actors. Kenya has also developed the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP 2018-2022) which aims to further the country's development goals by providing mechanisms and measures to achieve low carbon climate-resilient development in a manner that prioritizes adaptation. Madagascar - the priority sectors for adaptation are: agriculture and livestock, forestry, public health, water resources and coastal zones. Malawi - The NAPA identifies the following as high priority activities for adaptation: \\"Improving community resilience to climate change through the development of sustainable rural livelihoods, Restoring forests in the Upper and Lower Shire Valleys catchments to reduce siltation and associated water flow problems, Improving agricultural production under erratic rains and changing climatic conditions, Improving Malawi’s preparedness to cope with droughts and floods, and Improving climate monitoring to enhance Malawi’s early warning capability and decision making and sustainable utilization of Lake Malawi and lakeshore areas resources\\". Mauritius - adaptation should address the following priority areas: coastal resources, agriculture, water resources, fisheries, health and well-being, land use change and forestry and biodiversity. Mozambique - \\"The proposed adaptation initiatives target various areas of economic and social development, and outline projects related to the reduction of impacts to natural disasters, the creation of adaptation measures to climate change, fight against soil erosion in areas of high desertification and coastal zones, reforestation and the management of water resources.\\" Rwanda has developed the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA 2006) which contains information to guide national policy-makers and planners on priority vulnerabilities and adaptations in important economic sectors. The country has also developed sector based policies on adaptation to climate change such as the Vision 2020, the National Environmental Policy and the Agricultural Policy among others. Tanzania Tanzania has outlined priority adaptation measures in their NAPA, and various national sector strategies and research outputs. The NAPA has been successful at encouraging climate change mainstreaming into sector policies in Tanzania; however, the cross-sectoral collaboration crucial to implementing adaptation strategies remains limited due to institutional challenges such as power imbalances, budget constraints and an ingrained sectoral approach. Most of the projects in Tanzania concern agriculture and water resource management (irrigation, water saving, rainwater collection); however, energy and tourism also play an important role. Zambia - \\"The NAPA identifies 39 urgent adaptation needs and 10 priority areas within the sectors of agriculture and food security (livestock, fisheries and crops), energy and water, human health, natural resources and wildlife\\" Zimbabwe - \\"The other strategic interventions by the NAP process will be: Strengthening the role of private sector in adaptation planning, Enhancing of the capacity of Government to develop bankable projects through trainings, Improving management of background climate information to inform climate change planning, Crafting a proactive resource-mobilization strategy for identifying and applying for international climate finance as requests for funds are primarily reactive at present, focusing on emergency relief rather than climate change risk reduction, preparedness and adaptation, Developing a coordinated monitoring and evaluation policy for programs and projects, as many institutions within the government do not currently have a systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation. \\" North Africa Southern Africa Southern Africa Adaption Measures Lesotho - \\"The key objectives of the NAPA process entail: identification of communities and livelihoods most vulnerable to climate change, generating a list of activities that would form a core of the national adaptation program of action, and to communicate the country’s immediate and urgent needs and priorities for building capacity for adaptation to climate change\\" Namibia - the critical themes for adaptation are \\"Food security and sustainable biological resource base, Sustainable water resources base,Human health and well being and Infrastructure development\\" South Africa is in the progress of finalizing its national climate change adaptation strategy. \\"The National Adaptation strategy acts as a common reference point for climate change adaptation efforts in South Africa, and it provides a platform upon which national climate change adaptation objectives for the country can be articulated so as to provide overarching guidance to all sectors of the economy\\" West Africa and the Sahel The West African region can be divided into four climatic sub-regions namely the Guinea Coast, Soudano-Sahel, Sahel (extending eastward to the Ethiopian border) and the Sahara, each with different climatic conditions. The seasonal cycle of rainfall is mainly driven by the south-north movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which is characterised by the confluence between moist southwesterly monsoon winds and the dry northeasterly Harmattan. Based on the inter-annual rainfall variability, three main climatic periods have been observed over the Sahel: the wet period from 1950 to the early 1960s followed by a dry period from 1972 to 1990 and then the period from 1991 onwards which has seen a partial rainfall recovery.Rowell, D.P., 2003: The Impact of Mediterranean SSTs on the Sahelian Rainfall Season. J. Climate, 16, 849-862Nicholson, SE, Fink, AH and Funk, C, 2018: Assessing recovery and change in West Africa's rainfall regime from a 161‐year record. Int. J. Climatol., 38, 3770-3786 During the dry period, the Sahel experienced a number of particularly severe drought events, with devastating effects. The recent decades, have also witnessed a moderate increment in annual rainfall since the beginning of 1990s. However, total annual rainfall remains significantly below that observed during the 1950s. Some have identified the recent 2 decades as a recovery period. Others refer to this as a period of ‘hydrological intensification’ with much of the annual rainfall increase coming from more severe rain events and sometimes flooding rather than more frequent rainfall, or similarly other works underline the continuity of the drought even though the rainfall has increased. Since 1985, 54 percent of the population has been affected by five or more floods in the 17 Sahel region countries.Livelihood Security Climate Change, Migration and Conflict in the Sahel 2011 In 2012, severe drought conditions in the Sahel were reported. Governments in the region responded quickly, launching strategies to address the issue. The region is projected to experience changes in rainfall regime, with climate models suggesting that decreases in wet season rainfall are more likely in the western Sahel, and increases more likely in the central to east Sahel, although opposite trends cannot yet be ruled out.Rowell, D.P., Senior, C.A., Vellinga, M. and Graham, R.J., 2016: Can Climate Projection Uncertainty be Constrained over Africa Using Metrics of Contemporary Performance? Climatic Change, 134, 621-633Berthou, S., Rowell D. P., Kendon E.J., Roberts. M.J, Stratton R., Crook J. and Wilcox C., 2019: Improved climatological precipitation characteristics over West Africa at convection-permitting scales. Climate Dynamics, 53, 1991–2011 These trends will affect the frequency and severity of floods, droughts, desertification, sand and dust storms, desert locust plagues and water shortages. However, irrespective of the changes in seasonal mean rain, the most intense storms are expected to become more intense, amplifying flood frequency. Enhanced carbon emissions and global warming may also lead to an increase in dry spells especially across the Guinea Coast associated with a reduction of the wet spells under both 1.5℃ and 2℃ global warming level. Fifteen percent of Sahel region population has also experienced a temperature increase of more than 1 °C from 1970 to 2010. The Sahel region, in particular, will experience higher average temperatures over the course of the 21st century and changes in rainfall patterns, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  African Highlands   Shifts in Malaria Transmission Due to Climate Change  Climate change, and resulting in increased temperatures, storms, droughts, and rising sea levels, will affect the incidence and distribution of infectious disease across the globe.Beard, C. B., Eisen, R. J., Barker, C. M., Garofalo, J. F., Hahn, M., Hayden, M., . . . Schramm, P. J. (2016). Vector-Borne Diseases. Retrieved February 15, 2017, from https://health2016.globalchange.gov/vectorborne-diseases This is true in Africa, where malaria continues to have dramatic effects on the population. As climate change continues, the specific areas likely to experience the year- round, high-risk transmission of malaria will shift from coastal West Africa to an area between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, known as the African Highlands. =Exposures= To understand the exposures that affect shifting malaria transmission rates we can look to The Epidemiologic Triad, a model that explains the relationship between exposure, transmission, and causation of infectious diseases.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2012). Lesson 1: Introduction to Epidemiology. Retrieved March 26, 2017, fromhttps://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section8.html With regards to malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands, factors and exposures resulting from drastic environmental changes like warmer climates, shifts in weather patterns, and increases in human impact such as deforestation, provide appropriate conditions for malaria transmission between carrier and host. Because of this, vectors will adapt, thrive, and multiply at a fast pace. An increase in the number of vectors that carry parasites, microbes, and pathogens that cause disease will become a health hazard for the human population. Specifically, malaria is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites which are carried by the vector Anopheles mosquito. Even though the Plasmodium vivax parasite can survive in lower temperatures, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite will only survive and replicate in the mosquito when climate temperatures are above 20℃. Increases in humidity and rain also contribute to the replication and survival of this infectious agent., Increasing global temperatures combined with changes in land cover as a result of extreme deforestation will create ideal habitats for mosquitoes to survive in the African Highlands. If deforestation continues at its current rate, more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds, and the population of mosquitos will rapidly increase. The increase in mosquitoes will thus increase the opportunity for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites to proliferate. Exposure to malaria will become a greater risk to humans as the number of female Anopheles mosquitos infected with either the Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax parasite increases. The mosquito will transmit the parasite to the human host through a bite, resulting in infection. Then, when an uninfected mosquito bites the now infected human host, the parasite will be transmitted to the mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected human hosts. Individuals who are constantly exposed to the Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes that carry the parasite are at greater risk of dying. Infected humans can also transmit the disease to uninfected or healthy humans via contaminated blood. =Health Effects= The health effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands have the potential to be severe. Research has shown that the effects of climate change on health will impact most populations over the next few decades. However, Africa, and specifically the African Highlands, are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected. In 2010, 91% of the global burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa. Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess the potential effect of projected climate scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa. A study conducted by Caminade et al. concluded that the most significant climate change effects are confined to specific regions, including the African Highlands. These results are consistent with previous studies. Ultimately, studies show an overall increase in climate suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in the population at risk of contracting the disease. Of significant importance is the increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes (like the African Highlands). Rising temperatures in these areas have the potential to change normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics.Martens, W. J., Niessen, L. W., Rotmans, J., Jetten, T. H., & McMichael, A. J. (1995). The potential impact of global climate change on malaria risk. Environmental Health Perspectives, 103(5), 458–464. Consequently, new populations will be exposed to the disease resulting in healthy years lost. In addition, the disease burden may be more detrimental to areas that lack the ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses.  Scientific Limitations  Scientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in the African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of climate change and malaria. While modeling with temperature changes shows that there is a relationship between an increase in temperature and an increase in malaria transmission, limitations still exist. Future population shifts that affect population density, as well as changes in the behavior of mosquitos, can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining the future risk of malaria outbreaks, which also affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation.  Challenges and Solutions  The challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in the African Highlands are many and varied. Many of the strategies used to control malaria have not changed, are few in number and have rarely been added to in the last 20 years. The most common forms of control are educating the public and vector control. The huge geographic area of the vectors Anopheles is possibly the largest challenge faced in the control of malaria. With such a large area to cover it is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level.Osungbade, K. O., & Oladunjoye, O. O. (2012). Prevention of Congenital Transmission of Malaria in Sub- Saharan African Countries: Challenges and Implications for Health System Strengthening. Journal of Tropical Medicine, 2012, 1-6. doi:10.1155/2012/648456 This form of control is expensive, and the areas affected are not able to sustain control. Without sustained control, a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen. Another challenge with insecticides is that the vector is now becoming insecticide-resistant. Due to the fact that mosquitoes have several generations per year, resistance is seen very quickly. Education has its limitations as well, as the population most affected by malaria are children, and the educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity. The low socioeconomic status of the people who inhabit the African Highlands is also a challenge. Local health facilities have limited resources, and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria symptoms and increase the likelihood of death due to malaria. As climate change shifts geographic areas of transmission to the African Highlands, the challenge will be to find and control the vector in areas that have not seen it before, and to not waste resources on areas where the temperature is no longer conducive to parasite growth.Tanser, F. C., Sharp, B., & Sueur, D. L. (2003). The potential effect of climate change on malaria transmission in Africa. The Lancet, 362(9398), 1792-1798. doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14898-2 The solutions that can help malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges, but if they are effective they can truly change the areas currently affected. There are number of groups working on a vaccine, some are looking to control the transmission of the parasite to the host, or control transmission from human back to the vector.Nunes, J. K., Woods, C., Carter, T., Raphael, T., Morin, M. J., Diallo, D., . . . Birkett, A. J. (2014). Development of a transmission-blocking malaria vaccine: Progress, challenges, and the path forward. Vaccine, 32(43), 5531-5539. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.030 These vaccines are not very effective currently, and lose their effectiveness over time, so are not ideal. But, the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better, more effective long-lasting vaccine. An alternative to vaccines is vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) that is a form a gene therapy. This therapy will change cells in the host that will secrete antigens from various stages of the parasite in the hopes of triggering an anamnestic immune response in the recipient and prevent disease and parasite transmission.Rodrigues, M. M., & Soares, I. S. (2014). Gene-therapy for malaria prevention. Trends in Parasitology, 30(11), 511-513. doi:10.1016/j.pt.2014.09.005  Policy Implications  The policy implications of climate change and malaria rates in the African Highlands are also vast, and ultimately fall into two categories: # Enacting policy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus slowing down climate change, and # Mitigating problems that have already arisen, and will inevitably continue to develop, due to climate change. Addressing both of these areas is of great importance, as those in the poorest countries, including countries that make up the African Highlands, face the greatest burden. Additionally, when countries are forced to contend with a disease like malaria, their prospects for economic growth are slowed. This contributes to continued and worsening global inequality. When addressing policy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to act on a global scale, even when related effects are narrowed to a smaller area. The 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change made nine recommendations for governments to address. These include: # Make an investment in climate change research. # Increase financing for global health systems. # Eliminate coal as an energy source. # Support cities that encourage healthy activities for individuals and the planet. # Clarify carbon pricing. # Increase access to renewable energy in low to middle-income countries. # Quantify avoided burdens when these measures are taken. # Collaborate with global governments and health organizations. # Create an agreement that will help counties making changes to become low-carbon economies. When one focuses on mitigation, specifically as it relates to malaria in the African Highlands, research is still an important component. This research needs to take many forms, including attribution studies, to help clarify the degree to which malaria rates are attributed to climate change; scenario modeling, which can help further our understanding of future climate change consequences on malaria rates; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques, to help our understanding of what appropriate responses are. Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in the African Highlands will also be important, to better understand disease. Beyond these research priorities, it is also important that we enact policies that will significantly increase investments in public health in the African Highlands. This achieves two goals, the first being better outcomes related to malaria in the affected area, and the second being an overall better health environment for populations. It is also important to focus on “one-health approaches.\\" This means collaborating on an interdisciplinary level, across various geographic areas, to come up with workable solutions. These policies can be seen in action in the World Health Organization's “Adaptation to Climate Change in Africa Plan of Action for the Health Sector 2012-2016.\\"World Health Organization. (2012).

History  The Blandijnberg was already inhabited in prehistoric times. In the 3rd century AD. there was a Gallo-Roman villa on the hill, owned by a person named Blandinus. In the 7th century, Saint Amand founded the Benedictine Saint Peter's Abbey on top of the Blandijnberg. The area around the abbey was known as Sint-Pietersdorp (Saint Peter's Village). With the expansion of Ghent in the 13th century, the abbey was included in the walled city. At the end of the Ancien Régime, the church possessions on the Blandijnberg were confiscated by the city. In the 19th century, the Blandijnberg area was completely urbanized and had become a laborers' neighborhood. In 1848 Sint-Pietersplein, the city's largest square, was laid out in order to redevelop the area. At the end of the 19th century, part of the hill was cleared to build new university buildings for Ghent University. In the 1930s, the Ghent University Library with its iconic Boekentoren, designed by Henry Van de Velde, was built on top of the Blandijnberg. In 1960, the new buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, known as the Blandijn, were opened. The Blandijn is directly adjacent to the Boekentoren.

Reign This king acceded in his thirty-sixth year, but there are indications that he may have effectively governed the kingdom for a substantial period before this on behalf of the previous king, Yuknoom the Great.Martin and Grube 2008:110 The latter, who may have been Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahk's father, lived well into his eighties and may have been incapacitated in his later years. Calakmul, city of Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ The inscription of Stela 9, from 662, goes into great detail about the birth of Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ and accords him a full royal title; thus military victories in the following years, as well as successful assertions of Kaan's hegemony, might tentatively be ascribed to Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ. These include military triumphs over Tikal in 677 and (quite probably) 679; supervision of the accessions of kings of Moral and Cancuen in 662 and 677 respectively; the dispatching of Lady Six Sky from Dos Pilas to re-seed the dynasty of Naranjo in 682, and a lieutenant's action expressive of Kaan overlordship at Piedras Negras in 685. Yichʼaak Kʼahk's:es:Q'anjob'al (etnia)#cite ref-3 accession was recorded at El Peru by local ruler Kʼinich Bahlam and at Dos Pilas by Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil. At Naranjo, the son of Lady Six Sky, Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Chaak, acceded in 693. In 695 Calakmul suffered a military defeat at the hands of Tikal and it was believed that the king was killed or captured in that battle. A stucco scene at Tikal shows a prisoner being \\"adorned\\" for sacrifice and names the Kaan king in a related caption; the text is damaged and in its current condition it allowed for the possibility that it referred to Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ himself instead of him being the overlord of the prisoner to be killed. A new find at La Corona has revealed that the king survived at least until 696, when he made a visit to that town. There are reasons to believe that Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ is buried in Tomb 4 within Calakmul's Structure 2. Yichʼaak Kʼahk's monument program does not even begin to compare with that of his immediate predecessor, and the two stelae that still stand (including Stela 105 from 692) are located far from the site core in the Northeast Group.Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens by Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube (2008:45, 75, 109-111):es:Tikal References Category:Kings of Calakmul Category:7th century in the Maya civilization Category:7th-century monarchs in North America Category:649 births Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Yuknoom Yichʼaak Kʼahkʼ"},{"id":"34336003","text":"Athetis maculatra is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae.

Werner (1805–1875) was a nineteenth-century wrought iron manufacturer, artisan, and entrepreneur based in Charleston, South Carolina, US. He was one of three noted German-American ironworkers in Charleston, who created most of its high-quality wrought iron. He had immigrated from Prussia in his late 20s, already an accomplished businessman. In Charleston he married a young woman from England, another immigrant, and they had a family. Werner is known for crafting the \\"Iron Palmetto\\", dedicated to South Carolina's Palmetto Regiment that fought in the Mexican–American War. Erected in 1853, it is the oldest monument on the grounds of the state Capitol. He was highly influential, completing high-quality iron design and manufacture in Charleston and throughout the state, including gates, architectural ornamentation, and balconies.  Biography  Werner was born in 1805 in Münster, in the Prussian Westphalia (now the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany). His father, Burnhard, was a wealthy carriage builder. The young Werner learned his initial blacksmithing skills of iron working in his father's blacksmith shop. Werner became known while still a young man as a carriage maker, blacksmith, wrought iron worker, and a businessman. In Prussia, Werner would have to serve compulsory years in the authoritarian Prussian Army.Anja Johansen, Soldiers as Police: The French and Prussian Armies and the Policing of Popular Protest, 1889–1914 (2005), p. 37: \\"The Prussian army had been based on universal conscription since its reorganisation in 1807–1815 after the old Prussian army's collapse before Napoleon's mass-army.\\" He decided to emigrate to the United States, which he did in the early 1830s. He took up residence in Charleston, South Carolina, where he obtained American citizenship by naturalization in 1839. He almost certainly arrived in America more than five years before that, as the naturalization process at that time took at least five years to complete. In 1841 Werner married Isabella Hanna, an immigrant from Liverpool, England. They had six children, five of whom lived to adulthood, with a son named Bernard dying at the age of six. Their children were literate and some received formal schooling. John Hanna Werner, the youngest son, was sent to Germany for part of his schooling. The children were raised in the Lutheran church. According to the 1850 U.S. Census, in 1850 Werner was 45 years old and his wife about 13 years his junior, with an age of 32. The other family members were Robert H. Werner (9), Mary Werner (8), Bernard Werner (1), and Hannah Werner (65).1850 U.S. Census, Home in 1850: St Michael and St Phillip, Charleston, South Carolina; Roll: M432_850; Page: 167A; Image: 174 According to the next census, in 1860 Werner was 55 years old and his wife 14 years his junior, 41 years old, the other family members being Robert Werner (18), Mary Werner (15), Jno. H Werner (4), Grace Werner (1), and Ann Lee (70).1860 U.S. Census, Charleston Ward 4, Charleston, South Carolina; Roll: M653_1216; Page: 337; Image: 308; Family History Library Film: 805216 They lived in Charleston Ward 4,Charleston Ward 4 Charleston, South Carolina. Werner and his wife reared their children in his Lutheran faith.  American career  Werner had followed in his father's footsteps and first became a maker of carriages. He later added a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop, and a moulding shop to his business as a carriage maker. His foundry was located in Charleston on the street corner of Cumberland and State. His business soon expanded into a large enterprise throughout the state of South Carolina. Werner had an excellent reputation for quality work. It has been said that his work did not need the modest stamp \\"Werner, fecit\\" (Werner made it) as the grace and beauty of his work spoke for itself.Werner's obituary exclaimed, \\"Immediately the effect of his genius was felt, and ever since then it has not needed the modest stamp \\"Werner, fecit\\" to tell by whose masterly direction beauty and grace of proportion and very life took possession of the dead metal.\\" During the nineteenth-century there was a type of guild of the \\"mechanic class\\" in Charleston, which was a group of men with special skills related to the mechanics of blacksmithing. They constituted a more or less secret society, keeping this \\"mechanic class\\" technology information to themselves. It was not shared publicly. Werner liked to construct new buildings and remodel older existing buildings. Because of this, he was temporarily located at his project while working on the \\"old house\\" and the \\"new house\\", and had his address there. He moved within different Charleston addresses, but always kept his foundry business address, near State and Cumberland Streets, as a permanent one. In 1859 he advertised in one of the Charleston directories, \\"C. Werner manufacturer of Railings, Verandahs, and Fancy Iron Works generally, together with repairing & smithery in all branches ... No.17 State, near corner of Cumberland St.\\" Most of his temporary addresses were in the vicinity of his foundry business and located generally on State Street, Cumberland Street, and Meeting Street. Werner strove \\"to show what could be accomplished in Charleston in the adornment of edifices, to make it worthy of the name of 'Queen City of the South.'\\" He was one of three German immigrants in Charleston who \\"created an abundance of the mid- nineteenth century ironwork.\\" The other two were J. A. W. Iusti and Frederick Julius Ortmann.  Works  Palmetto Regiment Monument, state capitol grounds Typical Werner gates Christopher Werner cross made by him, erected at his burial site He constructed iron fences and other wrought iron projects all over South Carolina. He was known for his design of business signs, using a wrought iron snake as the figure to hold the sign. The snake extended in circles from the wall, where it hung by its tail. In the snake's jaws was a sign of the merchant's business. A well-known work of Werner's was the spiral and finial of St. Matthew's Lutheran church on King Street. He also made all the wrought ironwork for the Abbeville, South Carolina, county courthouse. He was known for his manufacture in 1853 of the wrought iron Palmetto Monument, located on the Capitol grounds in Columbia. Made of iron, brass and copper, it represented the palmetto tree and commemorated the Palmetto Regiment that had fought in the Mexican–American War.\\"The State\\"; December 22, 1907; Issue: 6134; Page: 17 (column 3) \\"But the crowning achievement of Werner's artistic life was the making of what is at the same time his loveliest and most famous piece of work – namely, his wonderfully beautiful palmetto tree, which was bought by the State of South Carolina to serve as a noble monument to the memory of the splendid Palmetto regiment, whose achievements are among the finest in the whole long list of gallant feats in the history of American arms. This tree is made of iron, copper and brass and was built in 1853...\\"Werner's obituary described it as, \\"Inimitable in execution and almost excelling nature...\\" The lifelike tri-colored metal sculpture—\\"scarcely distinguishable from a real tree\\"—was designed by Henry Steenken, who worked in Werner's shop. After it was toppled and shattered by a \\"freak\\" February 3, 1939, tornado, the monument and the plates with the names of the war dead were restored. Werner had made the monument without a commission, and as \\"a speculation.\\" He was relying upon his execution of the sculpture, and the tree's importance as a secular and cultural icon, to enable him to be paid for it. He knew that the state had suffered a loss of many men. Like \\"a fisherman, casting and letting the bait settle,\\" he installed the monument in front of the old statehouse. He had done it is an homage, embodying the State Seal's palmetto tree and recognizing the sacrifices of men from the state in the Mexican War (1846–1848).The South had sent 43,232 troops, compared to 22,136 from the more populated North. The \\"Palmetto Regiment suffered greater losses than any other American unit.\\" Of 974 volunteers, 501 succumbed to wounds and disease. Among them was former governor Pierce M. Butler, who died in the fight. The question of payment for the monument and for the associated plaques became embroiled in politics, leaving Werner unhappy and dissatisfied. Called by some the \\"Iron Palmetto,\\" it is the oldest monument at the Capitol. Werner was initially paid $5,000 for the sculpture; but he said he had put more than $11,000 into the project. He manufactured the \\"Sword Gate\\", likely designed by well-regarded Charleston architect Charles F. Reichert. It is one of the two most notable iron gates in Charleston, the other being the St. Michael's Cemetery Gate by Iusti. Like many of Werner's other works, it was probably ordered by one patron and installed for another, because the work exceeded the initial contractual cost. Werner also created the iron gate located at 34 Broad St., Charleston, South Carolina.\\"Do You Know Your Charleston?\\", Charleston (S.C.) News & Courier, 7 Nov. 1932, p. 10. According to a 1907 newspaper report, Werner's wrought ironwork could be seen at Mayor Rhett's \\"handsome old house\\" on Broad Street in Charleston, previously (and later) known as the John Rutledge House. Werner had made the wrought iron work for the original owner, Thomas N. Gadsden. The Rutledge house incorporates two of Werner's favored design elements: palmettos and eagles. Werner also made the entrance gate to Judge Simonton's house at Tradd and Legare streets. Werner crafted the iron gates for the Hibernian Hall, built in 1840 as a meeting place for the Hibernian Society, an Irish benevolent organization founded by immigrants in 1801. The Hall was later associated with the National Democratic Convention of 1860, a critical political assembly in United States history. Democratic divisiveness is believed to have contributed to Republican Abraham Lincoln winning the presidency that year. The design includes Irish harps. This building has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Werner continued to work until 1870, making a career in Charleston alone of more than 35 years. He is considered a successor of other master craftsmen in Charleston, and he was one of a triumvirate of 19th-century German masters of fashioning iron into artful gates. According to traditional folklore, some of Charleston’s \\"finest\\" cast iron gates were cut down during the American Civil War and reworked as horseshoes. Others were said to be melted down to create the sides of the ironclad CSS Virginia, formerly the . The United States Patent Office shows that Werner has patent No.109,694, issued November 29, 1870, for an improvement in awning-frames.Patent No.109,694 Another Werner patent was filed posthumously in 1877 by his widow Isabella as No.194,278, on improvements of Werner's previous patent.Patent No.194,278  Death and burial  Werner died on June 11, 1875. A large wrought-iron cross was erected at his grave, near the entrance to the St. Lawrence Roman Catholic cemetery, Charleston. Having grown up in the Roman Catholic faith, Werner wanted to be buried in the new Catholic cemetery south of Magnolia.D. Huger Bacot, Jr.; \\"Christopher Werner: Great Iron-Worker, Creator of Famous Palmetto on State- House Grounds and of the Beautiful Designs Here and in Charleston\\", The State, 22 December 1907; Issue: 6134; Page: 17; Location: Columbia, South Carolina. The last paragraph of this source says: \\"At his death Werner remembered the religion that he had been brought up in and expressed a wish that he should be buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Magnolia. As has already been said, he willed the splendid iron cross spoken of should be placed over his grave. This all came as a surprise to his family, which had grown up Lutheran. But his wish was respected, and he was buried in St. Laurence cemetery, with his handsome iron cross above him just as he desired. And thus passed away the profound master of wrought iron work, whose life and splendid accomplishments are striking illustrations of that noble lien -'A thing of beauty is a joy forever.\\" His family was surprised by this request because they were reared as Lutheran, but his wishes were honored. Father Daniel J. Quigley, a priest from Charleston's Roman Catholic Cathedral, officiated at the funeral.Ciociola, p. 32 Werner's grave is numbered Range Center Plat 1, Lot 1, Grave 1. His age at death was given as seventy years and four months, and the cause of death as chronic hepatitis. After his widow died on June 29, 1894, she was buried alongside him. When the monumental cross was dismantled to be restored, the remains of both were found beneath it.

He was created a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI on 18 February 2012. He was the second Maltese member of the College of Cardinals, the first since 1843. Formation and studies Born Stanley Grech in Vittoriosa, Malta, on 24 December 1925, he studied at the Lyceum. He took the name Prospero when he joined the Augustinian Order in 1943. While Malta was under siege during the Second World War, Grech served as a gunner in the Royal Malta Artillery. He was ordained to the priesthood at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome on 25 March 1950. Grech studied philosophy at St. Mark's Priory, Rabat, Malta, and theology in St. Monica's College, Rome. He earned a doctorate in theology at the Gregorian University, Rome (1953), obtained a licentiate in sacred scripture from the Pontifical Biblical Institute, Rome (1954), and a diploma in educational psychology from University of Fribourg, Switzerland (1951). Grech conducted research in Semitic languages at the universities of Oxford (1957–58) and Cambridge (1958–59). Teaching In 1959, Grech was appointed lecturer at the Augustinian Theological College, Rabat. He also served as professor at the Augustine Institute and joined the staff of the Vicar General for Vatican City. As secretary to the Vicar General, Bishop Petrus Canisius Van Lierde, who was sacristan of the Apostolic Palace, his duties included dressing Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI for liturgical functions. During the 1963 Papal conclave, he heard Giovanni Battista Montini's confession a couple of hours prior to his election as Pope Paul VI. In 1970, together with Fr. Agostino Trapè, Grech founded the Patristic Institute Augustinianum attached to the Lateran University in Rome and served as its president from 1971 to 1979. He was a member of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (SNTS); he became a member of the Pontifical Academy of Theology in 2003 and of the Pontifical Biblical Commission in 2004. Grech lectured on hermeneutics for over thirty years at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. He became a consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1984 and went to India on behalf of the congregation as an apostolic visitor of seminaries in 1998. Grech authored various articles and publications and presented lectures on the Bible, hermeneutics and patristics. On 13 December 2011, he was appointed a Companion of the National Order of Merit of the Republic of Malta. Cardinal Pope Benedict XVI announced on 6 January 2012 that he would create Grech a cardinal, together with 21 others, on 18 February 2012. He was the first Augustinian made a cardinal in 111 years. As canon law requires cardinals to be bishops unless they receive special dispensation, Grech was consecrated a bishop on 8 February 2012 by Paul Cremona, Archbishop of Malta, assisted by Archbishop Giuseppe Versaldi, and Mario Grech, Bishop of Gozo. He took the episcopal motto ('In you, Lord, I take refuge'), from the opening words of Psalm 71. He was created a cardinal deacon by Pope Benedict XVI in a consistory on 18 February 2012 and assigned the titular church of Santa Maria Goretti. Grech delivered the opening meditation at the 2013 papal conclave, but his age prevented him from participating as an elector. He warned that the Church was always threatened by disunity: \\"Between ultra-traditionalist extremists and ultra-progressive extremists, between priests rebelling against obedience and those who don't recognize the signs of the times, there always will be the risk of small schisms that not only damage the church, but go against the will of God.\\" He raised the issue of how the Church hierarchy was handling the sexual abuse crisis: \\"Today many people are not able to come to believe in Christ because his face is obscured or hidden behind an institution that lacks transparency.\\" When Pope Francis marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Augustinianum, he praised Grech for the \\"grandiose simplicity\\" his sermons had achieved in his old age. Grech died in Rome's Santo Spirito Hospital on 30 December 2019. Notes References ;Additional sources * Rafael Lazcano, Episcopologio agustiniano.

In a career that lasted from July 1853 to September 1854 he ran ten times and won eight races. After being beaten in his first racecourse appearance he won his next seven races including the 1854 Epsom Derby. Andover was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season. After less than two years as a stallion in England he was sold and exported to Russia. Background Andover was a strongly built bay horse with one white foot, standing 15.2 hands high. He was bred by William Etwall, of Longstock near the Hampshire town of Andover, after which the colt was named.http://www.ebooksread.com/authors- eng/william-day/reminiscences-of-the-turf-with-anecdotes-and-recollections-of- its-principal-cel-hci/page-6-reminiscences-of-the-turf-with-anecdotes-and- recollections-of-its-principal-cel-hci.shtml He was sired by Bay Middleton, an unbeaten champion racehorse who won the 2000 Guineas and the Derby in 1836. He was also a highly successful stallion being Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1844 and 1849 and siring the Derby and St Leger winner The Flying Dutchman. Andover's dam (sometimes referred to as the sister to Aegis) was an unnamed mare by Defence, who went on to produce Anton, a colt who finished second in the 2000 Guineas and won the St. James's Palace Stakes. Andover was offered for sale as a yearling and was bought by the former prize-fighter John Gully who owned the colt in partnership with Henry Padwick (also known as Mr Howard). Andover was sent into training with John Day at Danebury in Hampshire and ridden in most of his races by Alfred Day, his trainer's younger brother. Racing career 1853: two-year-old season Andover's racing career began in July at Goodwood, where he ran twice. He finished third to Alembic in the Ham Stakes on his debut and then won the Molecomb Stakes by a length and a half from the future Epsom Oaks winner Mincemeat. He made two more appearances at Brighton in August, walking over in a £175 Sweepstakes when no other horses appeared to oppose him and then completing his hat-trick by winning a £100 Plate. In the latter race he carried top weight of 123 pounds and won by a head from Quince. He was to have been aimed at the Criterion Stakes, a valuable race at Newmarket in October, but sustained an injury which kept him off the racecourse for the remainder of the season. Andover's winning prize money of £810 made him only the twelfth highest earning two-year-old of the season, but some considered him a serious contender for the following year's Derby. 1854: three-year-old season M.P. Andover made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Derby on 31 May. In a field of twenty- seven runners he started 7/2 second favourite for the £5,950 prize. Ridden by Alfred Day, he was held up in the early stages before making steady progress and turning into the straight in third place behind the 2000 Guineas winner The Hermit and the 5/2 favourite Dervish. Inside the final quarter mile the two leaders began to weaken, and Day sent Andover into the lead. He held off the strong late challenge of King Tom to win by a length in a time of 2:52.0 After the Derby, Andover developed a \\"curb\\" or swelling of the hock but he nevertheless appeared at his local course at Stockbridge for a Triennial Stakes on 29 June. He started at odds of 2/7 and won by a length from a good colt named Ivan, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. In July he walked over for a £125 race at Goodwood and then returned to Brighton where he won the Champagne Stakes by a length from two opponents at odds of 1/20. In autumn Andover was sent to Doncaster, although he had not been entered for the St Leger. His seven-race winning streak came to an end in the Eglington Stakes on 14 September, in which he was set to carry top weight of 131 pounds over a distance of a mile. Before the race he looked impressive but \\"a little too fat\\" and in the race itself he finished fourth, beaten three lengths by a two- year-old colt named The Chicken. The winner was later renamed Vengeance and won the Cesarewitch Handicap in 1856. On the following day Andover returned to his best form to win the Don Stakes by a neck from Gospodar. Andover seems to have been kept in training as a four-year-old as he appeared among the entries for the Chester Cup, but he never ran again. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Andover was bought for £1,450 by the leading breeder Sir Tatton Sykes and stood as a stallion at his Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. Before any of his offspring appeared on a racecourse, Andover was sold for £2,000 and exported to Russia in 1856.

He was one of the first professional representatives of Azerbaijani visual arts and was the founder of realistic easel painting of Azerbaijan. Biography Bahruz Kangarli was born on 22 January 1892 in Nakhchivan. He was hard of hearing due to an illness as a child, which is why he could not attend a comprehensive secondary school and was instead homeschooled. In 1910, he went to Tiflis with the support of Jalil Mammadguluzadeh and entered the Tiflis School of Arts under the Society of Encouragement of Fine Arts, where Otto Schmerling and Yegishe Tadevosyan taught at that time. He painted portraits of Schmerling and his colleague Lado Gudiashvili while he studied there. Various satirical magazines published in Russia in the prerevolutionary period, especially Molla Nasraddin magazine of Baku published Kangarli's works, next to caricatures by Schmerling and satirical paintings of Azim Azimzade, whom Kangarli was inspired by. He returned to Nakhchivan after graduating from the School of Arts in 1916. The landscape genre took up a great place in his creativity. Kangarli's watercolor paintings depicting the nature of his native land include \\"Waterfall\\", \\"Agridag\\", \\"The road in Yakhshan village\\", \\"Ilanly mountain under the moonlight\\", \\"Russian church in Nakhchivan\\", \\"Before rising time of the Sun\\", and \\"Spring\\". Monuments of culture were portrayed in his landscapes \\"Momine Khatun Mausoleum\\", \\"Ashabi-kahf Mountain\\", and \\"Prophet Noah's grave\\". Compositions \\"Matchmaking\\", \\"Wedding\\" and also artworks and costume sketches for the theatrical plays The Deadmen (by Jalil Mammadguluzade), Haji Gara (by Mirza Fatali Akhundov), Pari-jadu (by Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev) and other plays staged in Nakhchivan are examples of Azerbaijani art of the time. Kangarli also created portraits of his contemporaries (\\"An old man\\", \\"A Georgian\\"), and a series of paintings called \\"Refugees\\" (\\"Refugee-lady\\", \\"Refugee-boy\\", \\"Refugee-woman\\", and \\"Homeless family\\"). Kangarli's album called \\"Memories of Nakhchivan\\" with his 20 landscapes is currently kept in the Azerbaijan State Museum of Art. He was known to hold exhibitions of his paintings in his own house, with free entrance. Kangarli also drew portraits of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels during the first months of the Soviet rule. Kangarli exhibited more than 500 works painted by him at the first exhibition organized with Revcom's assistance, in 1921, in Azerbaijan. This exhibition was of great importance to him, and Kangarli donated one third of the money raised to an orphanage. Kangarli left an artistic legacy of more than 2000 artworks created during his short creative activity of seven years. On 22 May 2007 Kangarli's home-museum was established in Nakhchivan, and a monument was erected on his grave.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History On 9 January 1880, the Northampton Street Tramways Company was founded at a meeting in London. It quickly gained parliamentary approval for a network of 7 lines to be built in Northampton. Jabez Spencer Balfour was the chairman of the company. The Vice- Chairman was W.J. Pierce (Mayor of Northampton 1880-81). The directors were J. Pelton, D.B. Miller, and H.S. Freeman. The company signed a contract on 14 March 1881 and construction began. Major General Hutchinson of the Board of Trade inspected the works at 09.00 hrs on 4 June 1881. Following some remedial works, there was an inaugural run for local dignitaries, and the tramway opened to the public on the same day at 18.00 hrs. Stables had been erected on land behind 72 Abingdon Street in the town centre.Northamptonshire Horse Tramways, A. W. Brotchie, Tramway Review, Vol. 11. No. 81, Spring 1975 The entrance to the depot was through a narrow passageway, but the land at the back provided space for 31 horses, 8 cars, a smithy, granary and fodder store. There was also a paddock and small grazing area for sick animals, but this was later built on with extensions to the depot. Routes The first route ran from All Saints church in the town centre, along Abington Street and Kettering Road to the White Elephant (then the Kingsley Park Hotel). It ran west down Gold Street to St James' End. There was also a route along St Georges Terrace, Kingsthorpe Hollow to Kingsthorpe. This part of the system was extended around 1883. In 1884 the St James' route was extended along Weedon Road. In 1893 an extension was built along Wellingborough Road towards Weston Favell. This opened on 18 May 1893. Financial controversy By 1885 there was dissent amongst the shareholders. At the meeting in August a deficit of £139 was declared, but a motion that this be not accepted was carried. There were allegations of mismanagement and falsification of the accounts. The resignation of the directors was not accepted, and an Extraordinary Meeting was arranged. This failed to resolve the issue and a further meeting was arranged where several of the board of directors were replaced. Six months later they reported that there was now a credit balance of £154. The company took drastic measures to achieve this, having replaced many of the poor quality horses, they dismissed all of the conductors and employed 14- to 16-year-old boys who worked for 7 shillings per week. This caused great ill feeling (as there was already considerable unemployment). Sunday services were withdrawn. Further economies were put into effect - some of the 1881 cars were modified to remove the upper deck, stairs, and lower deck windows, to reduce the weight so that they could be operated by one horse rather than two. This resulted in an immediate improvement in the company fortunes. Cost of operating the horses fell from £2,088 in 1885 to £1,476 in 1887. Stock Six cars were ordered initially from the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company at Smethwick. Only four were delivered in time for the opening, but the remainder followed shortly afterwards. There were seats for 18 people inside, and 18 outside. By 1901 they were operating 21 tramcars, 3 buses and owned 100 horses. Gas engine experiment The company were keen to adopt mechanical power. A gas powered locomotive, designed and built in December 1882 at Mobbs' Vulcan Ironworks, Guildhall Road, Northampton was tested on the company tracks. On 3 March 1883 it successfully pulled a car containing a dozen people along the track by West Bridge. Nothing more is known of the subsequent history of this locomotive. Closure The system was bought by the Northampton Corporation Tramways on 21 October 1901 for the sum of £38,700.

He attempted to introduce new levels of musical sophistication to the genre. Some of his songs achieved popularity at the time. Early life Edwards was born in Manchester, England, and studied in Edinburgh and London. He became conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. He also conducted at the Royal English Opera House, where he met his wife, prima donna Philippine Siedle.\\"Honor Roll of Popular Song Writers, no 27, Julian Edwards\\", The Billboard, July 9, 1949. p.38. He composed a grand opera entitled Victorian, first performed at the Theatre Royal, Sheffield on 6 April 1883, which was also performed at Covent Garden Opera House on 19 January 1884. The libretto, by J F Reynolds-Anderson, was based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's play The Spanish Student. Broadway career Score for Edwards' musical comedy The Motor Girl. He soon turned his attention to lighter music, moving to New York at the invitation of Broadway producer James C. Duff, and creating a number of Broadway shows, beginning with Jupiter (1892), to a libretto by Harry B. Smith. He followed it with 17 more musicals.Gerald Bordman, \\"Edwards, Julian\\", The Oxford companion to American theatre, Oxford University Press, 1984. His first big success was Madeleine, or the Magic Kiss (1893). This was his first collaboration with playwright and lyricist Stanislaus Stange, with whom he worked on several other projects. They later had an even greater success with Brian Boru (1896), a \\"Romantic Irish Opera\\" based on the life of the medieval Irish king. Among his many other works, he also wrote Jolly Musketeer (1898), Princess Chic (1900),with Kirke La Shelle Dolly Varden (1902), When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1902), Love's Lottery (1904), The Gay Musician (1908, with book and lyrics by Chas. J. Campbell and Edward Siedle, his brother-in-law), The Motor Girl (1909) and The Girl and the Wizard (1909). Love's Lottery was intended as a vehicle for the German opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink, who withdrew after fifty performances. Some of Edwards' songs with lyricist Stanislaus Stange were published as independent pieces. Their patriotic song My Own United States from When Johnny Comes Marching Home, achieved particular popularity. Among the stars of the era who performed his work were Lillian Russell, Jefferson De Angelis, Della Fox, Christie MacDonald, and Lulu Glaser. Other works The published score of King René's Daughter While writing his Broadway shows, Edwards continued to work on more serious pieces. He made his name in America with an operatic adaptation of the play King René's Daughter (1893), presented as a one-act lyrical drama.Julian Edwards, \\"A Composer of Light Opera who has recently become famous\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, October 30, 1896, p. 23. Edwards wrote the libretto himself, from an existing English translation. The opera was criticised on the grounds that his music \\"wallows in Wagner\\". Edwards had intended to submit it for the Sonzogno prize for one- act operas, but it was completed too late.\\"Julian Edwards Dead: Composer succumbs to heart disease at his Yonkers home\\", New York Daily Tribune, Sep. 5, 1910, p. 3 The work had only limited success.Bordman, Gerald Martin. American musical theatre: a chronicle, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 132; 281. He also composed The Patriot (1907), another one-act grand opera, to a libretto by Stange, set in the American War of Independence. He completed two more grand operas, Elfinella and Corinne, but these were unproduced. He was particularly proud of his sacred cantatas, including The Redeemer and Lazarus. His oratorio Mary Magdalene was not fully completed before his death. In 1907 he set a translation of P. D. A. Atterbom's poem The Mermaid. He wrote incidental music for productions of many plays, including Quo Vadis, In the Palace of the King, Gringoire, The Wooing of Priscilla, King Robert of Sicily, The Cipher Code, In a Balcony, The Land of Heart's Desire and others. He also published collections of songs, including \\"Sunlight and Shadow\\", and copyists' full scores of two symphonies, in E major and A minor, exist in the Tams- Witmark collection at the Library of Congress. Views on music and songwriting When interviewed in 1908 Edwards was asked about the proper relationship between a composer and a lyricist. He took the view that there is no single model but stated that \\"to my mind the ideal collaboration between the musician and the librettist is that of Gilbert & Sullivan. They stand alone.\\" He especially praised Gilbert's libretti, and described Sullivan's music as \\"clever\\". He dismissed his own work in light music, emphasising his serious works, particularly his operas and cantatas.\\"Julian Edwards\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, July 3, 1908, p.8. Initially, an opponent of Wagnerism, Edwards had become a strong supporter of the movement. He believed that Richard Strauss's Salome (1905) was the most important work of recent modern music. Edwards died of heart failure in 1910. He is described as a \\"serious, but poorly endowed\\" composer by theatre historian Gerald Bordman, but Bordman's comments on Edwards concern only his operettas.

It is an automated telescope designed to slew very rapidly to the location of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), to enable the simultaneous measurement of optical counterparts. GRBs can occur anywhere in the sky, fade very quickly, and were initially poorly localized, so the original LOTIS needed very rapid slewing (less than 10 sec) and an extremely wide field of view (greater than 15 degrees). However, this wide field of view meant it could not see faint sources, and only the brightest GRB afterglows could be studied. Later satellites such as HETE-2, and BATSE detector of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, delivered much more accurate GRB coordinates in real-time. This enabled the construction of Super-LOTIS, based upon a Boller and Chivens 0.6 meter telescope, with a much smaller field of view (originally 51' by 51'), but much deeper imaging. After a few years of operation in this mode (2000 to 2003), the Swift Gamma- Ray Burst Mission was launched in 2004 providing even smaller error boxes. The super-LOTIS optics were modified again, now with a 17' by 17' field of view at the secondary focus, and a simultaneous visible/NIR camera. To achieve the needed response time, Super-LOTIS is fully automated and connected via Internet socket to the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. It is still in operation as of 2012. Since GRB searches only occupy a small fraction of the possible observing time, Super-LOTIS is also used for supernova searches and general astronomy.

The movie was released in 1987 and was the most successful Flemish movie regarding the number of visitors in Belgian movie theatres until 1990. It was beaten by Koko Flanel, another movie with Stijn Coninx as director and Urbanus as main actor. Story Hector was brought into an orphanage as a child to cure his chicken pox. He was never picked up by his parents. 35 years later Hector is still there, surrounded by children who are still his playmates. The orphanage is run by nuns who never introduced Hector to real life and maturity. His life changes when he is remembered by an aunt named Ella. She and her husband Achiel run a baker's shop and are searching for a cheap worker. Ella is too busy with the rehearsals of a romantic theatre play where she has the main female role. A prominent Hollywood director will attend the play and Ella dreams to become a famous actress. Their son Jos is only interested in bicycle contests. Achiel suffers from a high blood pressure and his marriage with Ella is not that successful. Furthermore, he suspects Ella is having an affair with Gregoire, the father of Swa. Swa is Jos biggest competitor in bicycle racing. Gregoire also obtained the main male role in the romantic play. Hector seems not to be as clumsy as he looks. He makes clever inventions such as an automatisation of the baker's shop where many objects (such as a mixing machine, egg beater, ...) are now powered by a bicycle driven by Jos. Ella flirts with Hector hoping Achiel notices this so he will pay more attention to her. Instead of Achiel, this is noticed by Gregoire who got indeed an affair with Ella. Ella soothes Gregoire by telling Hector is just an immature big child. Gregoire does not believe Ella and considers Hector as a rival. Some time later, Jos is participating a bicycle race which he is about to win. Due to interaction of Hector, Jos falls just before the finish resulting Swa to win the course. Achiel is upset and sends Hector back to the orphanage. There, on the evening of Ella's play, Hector admits to the children he is in love with her. The children convince him to escape. Hector finds a way to escape and runs to the theatre. He arrives just before the play ends, where \\"Gregoire\\" has to kiss \\"Ella\\" to promise her eternal love. Hector dresses up as a noble count, sets foot on the stage and claims Ella. This ends up in a hilaric improvisation where Hector and Gregoire fight their personal vendetta, whilst the audience thinks this is part of the play. Hector wins the battle and Ella answers his love. Achiel, also sitting in the audience, is so jealous he gets a heart attack and dies in the theatre. Some time after the funeral Ella gets a letter from the director: she got a role in a movie and is about to leave to Hollywood. Hector is depressed when it turns out it was not Ella who promised eternal love, but the character she played. While Hector walks back to the orphanage, a taxi is driving Ella to the airport. There she realizes she is in love with Hector and asks the taxi driver to pick up Hector.

In the pre-Islamic times, numerous pilgrims gathered in Ma'rib city and headed to almaqah temple of Harunum to perform their cultic rituals, and continued to the sanctuary of Awwam using processional road. One of the most frequent titles of the god Almaqah was \\"Lord of ʾAwwām\\". Temple of Awwam The Temple of Awwam or \\"Mahram Bilqis\\" is a Sabaean temple dedicated to the principal deity of Saba, Almaqah, near Ma'rib in what is now Yemen. The temple is situated southeast of ancient Marib, and was built in the city outskirt. Usually Sabaean major sanctuaries are located outside urban centers, the reason behind it, is probably for religious privacy, and to facilitate the conduct of rituals by arriving pilgrims from remote areas of Sabaean territories.Robin, 1996 Such patterns are observed in several temples from Al- Jawf and the Hadramawt. The oldest inscription found in the complex was in reference to the building of the temple's massive enclosure by Mukarrib Yada\`'il Dharih I in the middle of the 7th century BCE. Indicating much earlier period of the temple's construction. Yada\`'il inscription was carved outside the wall, and contains the following: The largest part of the temple is occupied by an unguarded yard that is enclosed by a stone wall with an irregular oval ground plan. On the inner wall of the hall were several dozen highly important inscriptions from the late period of the Sabaean kingdom. Partial excavation of Awwam peristyle in 1951–1952 by the American Foundation for the Study of Man that was led by Wendell Philips, cleared the entrance court almost completely and made numerous discoveries. Such as elaborate bronze statues, and the usage of the southern entrance in the elliptic wall for ablution rituals before entering the cella. General plan of Awwam temple The temple is situated in isolated site functioning mainly as religious sacred area. The place-name, 'wm (place of refuge), signify that sacredness attached to the sanctuary. There is a possibility that the temple developed from a small shrine into an enormous complex encompassing multiple structures associated with the temple i.e. houses for priests, auxiliary rooms, workshops for metalworkers, cemetery connected to the sanctuary, and a residential area which form the so-called protected enclave. Geomorphological investigations have shown that the Awwam temple was erected on high natural platform, making it even more impressive for the viewers. Access to the complex was controlled by doors leading to hierarchical series of courtyards and halls that served as transitional areas. The temple itself was oriented towards the rising sun (north-east) and consisted of eight pillars propylaeum marking the entrance, followed by large rectangular peristyle hall, and massive oval shaped enclosure with other exterior linked structures (nearby cemetery). Pillars are the most widespread architectural feature used in ancient South Arabian religious structures. The peristyle hall might have reflected the numbers of the 8 pillared propylaeum; There are 32 pillars (4 × 8) inside the peristyle hall, and 64 recessed false windows (8 × 8). Statues of bronze bulls, horses, and humans used to be attached to the entrance gates of the temple. Many aspects of the decoration, geometrical and figural paintings, sculptures, large and precisely dressed stones, finely carved inscriptions painted red, and beautiful ornamental friezes on the wall's exterior, were meant to impress visitors and fill them with awe in the presence of god. Peristyle hall plan The peristyle hall The hall has a semi-rectangular form, with a pillared 8 monolith propylaeum entrance, topped by square tenons designed to accommodate an architrave. The perimeter of the peristyle hall is approximately 42 m × 19 m and is flanked by the end of the oval-shaped enclosure in its western and eastern exterior walls. The interior of the structure contains a large library of inscribed stone blocks and 64 vertically double false windows motif with 32 pillars made from single monolith except two that once supported stone beams.Albright (1952) pp. 26-28 The number 8 seems to reflect a sacred number, since it is used at the entrance, interior pillars (8 × 4), and false windows (8 × 8). Ancient South Arabian buildings, including Awwam peristyle hall, appears to be pre-planned according to a system of prescribed measurements instead of full use of space. AFSM excavation in the paved courtyard revealed multiple South Arabian inscriptions, a group of broken column capitals, bronze plaques, altars, and numerous pottery statues,Albright (1952) pp. 269-275 along with potsherds that date back roughly to 1500–1200 BCE. Visitors of the sanctuary are obliged to go through the annex, then via a gate of three entrances into the peristyle hall. The gate could be closed if needed.Zaid & Marqten (2008) pp. 228-240 A visible water conduit made from alabaster used to run through the hall and into a bronze basin (69 × 200 cm) placed in a room for purification purposes. The water fell on the floor like a fountain, and it fell so long and with such force that it eventually cut through a copper basin placed under and then into the stone itself. The oval shaped enclosure Reconstruction of the northwestern gate, only accessible to priests AFSM member with the help of locals copying an inscription from the sanctuary's exterior wall The enclosure is defined by massive oval shaped wall that flank the peristyle hall from its western and eastern wings, the wall measures approximately 757 m long and 13 m high, however the original height can't be determined for certainty and it's difficult to assess its full extent. Many inscriptions, hundreds in quantity, were discovered in the sanctuary and nearby, only few that deals directly with the temple's construction. One of the terms used for the sanctuary was \\"gwbn\\"; the oracle sanctuary. The sanctuary include a raised platform within the temple's sacred area representing primordial mound. Which makes it more impressive when looked from a distance. It appears, from archeological investigation, that a cultic place was built around a wellspring inside the sanctuary. The oval sanctuary is accessible from two gates, either through the northwestern gate, or from the peristyle hall one, which was the main entrance, while the former was exclusively built for priests. Third gate was discovered by AFSM, but it was for the cemetery and accessed only from the interior of the oval sanctuary and restricted to funerary rites usage. The oval sanctuary precinct was the main and holy part of Awwam temple. It was an open space that contains several structures, courtyards, and wellspring. Most rituals were performed in the oval sanctuary, and according to Sabaean inscriptions, was the house of Almaqah. This holiness is demonstrated by the existence of three places for purification and to perform ablutions before entering the sacred spaces, primarily the oval sanctuary (dwelling house of Almaqah). Cleanness is emphasized by the discovered inscriptions that deals with physical and spiritual purity of worshipers. Several inscriptions attest that an individual who enter the sanctuary without performing purification rituals, will suffer severe consequences. Although no detailed information concerning the act of purification is mentioned in Sabaean inscriptions. The cemetery Awwam cemetery The 7th century BCE cemetery is attached to the Oval Sanctuary, and apparently accessed only from it. The cemetery hosts around 20,000 estimated burials during its long period of usage. That lengthy period created a large settlement of the dead, where passages and streets divide the tombs. The cemetery tombs were multi-storey structures (up to four) built using excellently polished and dressed limestone blocks. External walls were sometimes decorated with friezes and low relief of the dead's face. According to south Arabian inscriptions the cemetery was known as \\"Mhrm Gnztn\\" (cemetery sacred enclave). Despite the sacredness of the cemetery, no surplus of epigraphic remains for the ritual ceremonies were found in the complex. Apparently the rituals were conducted in the Oval Sanctuary Precinct, then they enter the cemetery where further ceremonies took place before burial.Roring (2005) pp. 153-159 The memory of the dead was preserved by placing sculptural representations of them on their tombs, frequently inscribing their names.

It was developed by Uriah Lott and businessmen of San Antonio as a direct route from the city to Aransas Bay on the Texas Gulf coast.See Allhands, J. L. \\"Gringo Builders.\\" (Iowa City, Clio Press)(1931). It was eventually absorbed in the 20th century by Southern Pacific. Background Uriah Lott, a transportation entrepreneur, engaged his friends Richard King and contractor Mifflin Kenedy in development of three railroad lines in Texas to improve connections from major cities to smaller ones, and to trading areas in Mexico. The Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande Narrow Gauge Railroad connected Corpus Christi and Laredo. The St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway ran from Houston to Brownsville through the Rio Grande Valley and related stops. Supported by businessmen from San Antonio, the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway was developed to connect San Antonio with Aransas Bay on Texas' Gulf coast, where a deepwater port was being developed. Lott, Texas was named in the developer's honor. (After damaging hurricanes in the early 20th century, the US Army Corps of Engineers designated Corpus Christi to be the deep-water port in this area.) Line history The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway Company was incorporated in 1884, to fulfill the need for a direct railway route from San Antonio to Mexico. Augustus Belknap became president of the company's board of directors, all of whom were businessmen in San Antonio. George Polk was the surveyor. With no progress upon completion of Polk's survey, Belknap was replaced by Lott as president of the board. He gained support in the state legislature from Representative Mifflin Kennedy. Construction began in 1885, and the first train rolled out on the line in 1886. The railroad went into receivership in 1890. After a corporate reorganization whereby Southern Pacific acquired the majority of the stock, the receivership was lifted in 1892. As Section 5 of Article X of the Texas Constitution prohibited common control of parallel railroads, in 1903, the Southern Pacific Railway was sued by the Texas Railroad Commission. Southern Pacific lost the lawsuit and was compelled to divest itself of ownership of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway. In 1924, a change in statutes allowed Southern Pacific to regain control of the railway. The Southern Pacific relegated the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway into a secondary system and instead leased the track of the defunct San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad on the route from San Antonio to Corpus Christi, now part of the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1934, the Southern Pacific consolidated the San Antonio and Aransas Pass into their Texas and New Orleans subsidiary road.

It is a major source of protection for the players, made of metal covered either with a rubber or plastic coating (although early facemasks were made with pure plastic). Details of the face mask may vary according to each player and their needs for their position. For example, the quarterback's face mask in previous years could be just a single horizontal bar, since he has a need to see the entire field; today, quarterbacks, receivers and kickers/punters wear, at minimum, a two-bar facemask. (Single-bar face masks are no longer allowed in most levels, except for players who began using the single bar before the rules were implemented.) Positions such as linemen, however, may have several bars on their face mask, both horizontal and vertical. In the leather helmet era, an early attempt at face protection was the \\"executioner\\" helmet which covered the nose and much of the face. This helmet literally was a face mask bearing a strong likeness to traditional executioner face masks. Another early attempt in the leather helmet era at face protection was the nose guard. These simply covered the player's nose. In modern times, the term \\"nose guard\\" describes a player on the interior defensive line, usually aligned opposite the offensive center. Face masks first came into vogue in football during the second half of the 1950s, after the hard-shell plastic helmet became commonplace, and were adopted voluntarily and universally at all levels of gridiron football within one decade. Garo Yepremian was the last NFL player to not wear a face mask, only adopting one partway through the 1966 season. Single bars were initially the only available design, and this evolved over the course of the next several decades into the current cage-like designs, which became the norm at all levels by the early 1980s. Single-bar face masks were officially banned in professional football in 2004, with the remaining players still using them allowed to continue wearing them under a grandfather clause; Scott Player was the last player in professional football to wear the single-bar, finishing his career in 2009. Initially, face masks were clear lucite. They then became brown through the use of a rubber coating, which covered the metal bars; the brown later became a neutral gray, and would remain as such until 1974, when the then-San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs introduced the first colored facemasks to football; the two teams rolled out yellow and white facemasks, respectively. This opened the door to many teams at all levels of football changing the facemask color, but some have retained gray ones since. The term \\"face mask\\" in the game is also used to refer to the foul of illegally touching the equipment. In most leagues, tackling or otherwise restraining a player by grabbing the face mask is illegal due to the risk of injury, and the penalty is severe, drawing 15 yards, and also a first down if committed by the defense. In high school, the penalty is only 5 yards if the act was considered to be \\"incidental.\\" References Category:Gridiron football penalties ","title":"Face mask (gridiron football)"},{"id":"34336898","text":"1965–66 Albanian Cup () was the sixteenth season of Albania's annual cup competition.

In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It is found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices of cliffs, from in elevation.Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center: Garrya wrightii (Wright's silktassel) Description Garrya wrightii is a shrub slowly growing up to tall. It has branches that are square in cross-section and thick, tough leaves. The species is dioecious with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate plants. Both flower types are borne in catkin-like spikes. They are green. The fruit is a rounded purple berry under a centimeter wide containing one or two seeds. The seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries. Ecology This shrub grows in chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and Madrean pine-oak woodlands. It is rarely dominant but it occurs in many types of plant communities. It grows alongside many species of oak such as Emory oak (Quercus emoryi), gray oak (Quercus grisea), and Coahuila scrub oak (Quercus intricata). Other plants in the habitats may include birchleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), pointleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens), Pringle manzanita (Arctostaphylos pringlei), yellowleaf silktassel (Garrya flavescens), and hollyleaf buckthorn (Rhamnus crocea). It is adapted to wildfire-prone habitat, resprouting after being top-killed in fires. Uses Small amounts of rubber can be made from it. Livestock occasionally eat the plant, goats are especially partial to it. Cattle tend to dislike it because of its bitter taste. Many wild ungulates, such as mule deer, bighorn sheep, and elk browse it. Cultivation Garrya wrightii is cultivated as an ornamental plant, for planting as a shrub or small multi-trunked tree in gardens. It is used in drought tolerant and wildlife gardens, in natural landscaping design, for erosion control, and for habitat restoration projects.

From Erik Dahlberg's propaganda work Suecia antiqua et hodierna. Details and scale have likely been exaggerated. Eskilstuna House () was a royal palace in Eskilstuna, in present day Södermanland County, Sweden. It was erected on the site of a medieval monastery in the 16th century, and was later destroyed in a fire in 1680. The palace was the county seat of Eskilstunahus County during its existence, before its merger into Södermanland County in 1683.  History   Conversion from monastery to royal residence  The palace and its gardens were located on the site where the first church in the area had been erected by Saint Eskil. In the late 12th century or early 13th century a monastery belonging to the Hospitallers had been established here, which later was confiscated during the Swedish Reformation in 1527. King Gustav I had the monastery rebuilt into a royal palace. He and his sons occasionally used Eskilstuna House as a royal residence. Duke John's daughter Anna was born in the palace during his stay here in May 1568, and in June the same year the rebellion of the dukes John and Charles against their royal brother King Eric XIV was launched from the palace, leading to the imprisonment of Eric and the ascension of Duke John to the throne as John III. In 1589 Mary of the Palatinate, the first wife of Duke Charles (later King Charles IX) died in Eskilstuna House.Eskilstuna.se - (machine translation:)Historiens vingslag  Renaissance palace  The majority of the renaissance palace was constructed sometime after 1585 during Charles IX's reign as Duke of Södermanland, and it was completed by his son, Prince Charles Philip, during the early 17th century. The palace was two stories high, approximately 80 meters square (260 feet) and built around a square court. The south façade had two towers with domed roofs. The establishment of an ironworking industry close to Eskilstuna House in the 17th century transformed Eskilstuna into an industrial city. A plan drawn by Jean de la Vallée in 1658 for a new palace north of Eskilstunaån existed but was never realised.Eskilstuna.se, Jean de la Vallée - Eskilstuna map with proposed design for a new royal palace, 1658  Fire and modern day remnants  A fire in 1680 destroyed most of the upper levels of Eskilstuna House, only sparing the basements, which remained in use as a local prison. The palace was never rebuilt; instead, the seat of the county administration was permanently moved to Nyköping in 1683. Some of the material from the ruins was later used in the construction of the present Royal Palace of Stockholm. Presently, a school named after the palace and a cemetery belonging to Eskilstuna Parish are located on the site. Some remnants of the foundations are still visible in the cemetery.

She has participated and presented at conferences in a.o. Cameroon, Nigeria, and Italy. Early life Mercy Manci was born in Pondoland, the firstborn of a nine children, in the small village of Hlwahlwazi. At birth she was covered with a white substance, which her mother called a \\"net\\", which indicated that she was a special child. She was raised by her grandmother, because her mother was a domestic worker in Durban; her grandmother was a traditional healer and as a child Mercy would help her prepare muti. When she was teenager, she was \\"grabbed\\" by another family to marry one of their sons, in order to avoid lengthy lobola negotiations. As she was no longer a virgin, she could not return to her mother, and the marriage became official when the family paid four cows. She has one daughter from this marriage. While she lived in the Ciskei, and her husband went to work in the mines, she studied nursing through correspondence at Damelin. However, when her husband came home, he burned her books and destroyed the typewriter she bought. Eventually, after he discovered that she was taking contraceptives behind his back, something that was taboo at that time, their marriage ended and he sent her back to her family. Instead of returning to her family's home, she went to Johannesburg and found a job as a Doctor's assistant. While she was living in Johannesburg, she fell sick and began to dream strangely. Eventually a traditional healer would confirm that she need to answer a calling to become a sangoma. Activism Mercy Manci founded Nyangazeziswe, meaning Healers of the Nation, an organisation dealing with African traditional healing and HIV. She focussed on giving workshops for other traditional healers in the Eastern Cape, but also internationally, teaching them how to use condoms and how HIV is transmitted. In 2000 Mercy Manci appeared in an episode of Siyayinqoba Beat It! a television program about HIV, developed and produced by the Community Media Trust in South Africa.

The study was first published in Hungarian in 1997 as Élők és holtak, látók és boszorkányok by Akadémiai Kiadó. In 1999, it was later translated into English by Szilvia Rédey and Michael Webb and published by the Central European University Press. Building on the work of earlier historians such as Carlo Ginzburg and Gabór Klaniczay, both of whom argued that Early Modern beliefs about magic and witchcraft were influenced by a substratum of shamanistic beliefs found in pockets across Europe, in Between the Living and the Dead, Pócs focuses in on Hungary, using the recorded witch trial texts as evidence to back up this theory. The reviews published in specialist academic journals were mixed, with many applauding the fact that information on Hungarian witchcraft was being brought to a wider English-speaking audience. Conversely, some reviewers claimed that Pócs' argument was largely unconvincing and lacked sufficient evidence to support it, with criticisms also being aimed at Pócs' writing style and the quality of the English translation. Background Pócs' research In gathering the data for her book, Pócs noted that she made use of \\"several thousand pages of records\\", all of which pertained to the Hungarian witch trials of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. This included published documents relating to \\"approximately two thousand witch trials\\", and several hundred further documents which were unveiled in the course of Pócs' research by her team, who included fellow academics Gabór Klaniczay, Katalin Benedek, Ildikó Kristóf and Péter G. Tóth.Pócs 1999. pp. 7, 17. Synopsis Arguments Reception Academic reviews In his review for The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Andrew Sanders of the University of Ulster noted that Pócs' \\"examination and analysis are folkloric rather than anthropological\\", and that as a result, \\"the great majority [of case studies in the book] are examined in insufficient detail and contain inadequate information to answer the kinds of questions likely to be posed by anthropologists.\\" Furthermore, Sanders argued that \\"the main problem of the book could be poor translation from the original Hungarian. At times the discussion is difficult to follow or to understand, because the account is ambiguous or contradictory and the meaning is unclear\\". Believing that Pócs went into \\"bewildering detail\\" over her categorisation of the different kinds of Hungarian magical practitioner, Sanders finally remarked that the book could have been improved with a \\"more careful translation and/or presentation\\" and the inclusion of an index.Sanders 2000. Valerie Kivelson of the University of Michigan called Between the Living and the Dead an \\"intriguing book\\" in her review that was published in the Slavic Review journal. Noting that Pócs had set herself a \\"ambitious, broadly defined project\\", Kivelson felt that the work had both \\"strengths and weaknesses\\". Believing that the sources which she used were \\"rich and fascinating\\", containing \\"vivid testimony and lurid imagination\\", Kivelson felt that the work provided convincing evidence to support Carlo Ginzburg's theories regarding shamanistic survivals. Nonetheless, Kivelson did have some criticisms, for instance noting that \\"A more systematic study of Hungarian witchcraft trials and the villages and towns that produced them, even a brief summary of Gabor Klaniczay's work on the subject, would have added force to the argument\\", whilst she felt that the amount of space given over to categorizing the different types of magical practitioners was \\"dizzying\\".Kivelson 2000. In his review published in the History of Religions journal, Bruce McClelland remarked that in his view too much attention had been paid to the third type of witch by Pócs, leaving him wanting to know more about \\"the village witch and, to some extent, the more ambiguous figure of the healer-sorcerer\\". Moving on, McClelland argues that \\"Pócs is at her best when examining the Hungarian testimony for possible homologies between the witches and sorcerers of central and southeastern Europe (in particular, Romania and south Slavic regions) and those of western Europe\\", but he also felt that Pócs could have discussed the effect that the tensions between Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity might have had on Hungarian views of witchcraft. Further noting that he would have liked to have seen \\"a closer comparison between several of the Hungarian folkloric figures Pócs identifies as lurking behind the images of witches in the trial narratives and similar figures she notices in the folklore and mythology of neighboring cultures\\", he also laments that \\"any political role that gender may have played in the general system of witchcraft and sorcery is not investigated.\\" Writing in the journal Anthropos, T.O. Beidelman lamented that despite the huge amount of source material that Pócs had to work with, \\"No account whatsoever is provided to set these witch-hunts and trials (and thus the data at hand) into any kind of historical, cultural, or social contexts. We gain no idea of just what kind of materials may be found in these accounts, who transcribed them, or how these transcriptions may or may not relate to what actually occurred and just who believed what.\\" He argues that Pócs \\"displays little sense of proper historical procedures\\" in her method, and that she also \\"has little concern for any anthropological, sociological, or psychology theory\\", remarking that ultimately the work is \\"essentially [a] folkloristic, neo-Frazerian account content to describe a large aggregation of terms, beliefs, and practices mainly with the aims of comparing them to materials from elsewhere in Europe... and of tracing the possible origins of such ideas and customs to earlier beliefs and customs of the pre-Christian or even prehistoric past.\\" He furthermore criticised the style of writing, claiming that it was \\"rambling and discursive\\", to the extent that it became \\"the most serious weakness of this volume\\". He similarly criticises the translation into English, asserting that it \\"reads poorly\\". On a more positive note, Beidelman accepts that the \\"main value of Pócs's book lies in her making available a broad and detailed array of terms, beliefs, and customary practices of early Hungarian witchcraft and associated supernaturalism\\" that are otherwise unavailable to English-speaking scholars.

Alvarado. Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco, Appendix, p.16. 110, 407, N. D. Andres Pico et al., claimants for Mission San Jose, 30,000 acres. The grant derives its name from the secularized Mission San José, and was called ex-Mission because of a division made of the lands held in the name of the Mission—the church retaining the grounds immediately around, and all of the lands outside of this are called ex-Mission lands. The grant extended to the lands of present-day Fremont including the former towns, now districts of Centerville, Irvington and Mission San Jose. History Rancho Ex-Mission San José of 30,000 acres, in what is now Alameda County, was granted May 5, 1846, by Pio Pico to Andres Pico and Juan B. Alvarado. In 1850 Elias L. Beard, and John M. Horner acquired Alvarado's interest in the Rancho and began large scale farming of vegetables, potatoes and grain for the gold camps. They also began surveying and selling land in the Centerville area. In 1853, Beard, and Horner declared bankruptcy, due to a glut of potatoes on the market and a financial panic and the Ex Mission lands were acquired by their creditors. They also sold more of the land to more people.Woodruff Minor, Historical and Architectural Assessment, Trombras-Abreu Property, 43569-43575 Ellsworth Street, Fremont California, Community Development Department, City of Fremont, June 2006, pp.6–9. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim 110 for Rancho Ex- Mission San José was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852. Claimants before the Land Commission were Andrés Pico and Elias L. Beard, and John M. Horner who had bought out Alvarado's share. The land claim was filed March 22d, 1852, confirmed by the Commission December 18, 1855, but rejected by the Northern District Court (case 407ND) on June 30, 1859. The 180 land titles on the Ex Mission San Jose lands thrown into doubt by the 1859 court decision, were settled by the 1865 Act of Congress, \\"An Act for the Relief of the Occupants of the Lands of the Ex Mission of San Jose in the State of California\\". The land was surveyed and partitioned into parcels. Claimants could then buy their land back at the rate of $1.25 per acre.

Foerster (April 17, 1927 - January 11, 2000) was a Democratic politician. Foerster held a variety of political positions in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and was seen as one of the last \\"machine\\" politicians from the area. Career A native of Pittsburgh, Foerster was active in athletics while a high school student, and while attending Slippery Rock College (now a university). He also began coaching youth football. State House Foerster unsuccessfully sought a seat in the Pennsylvania State House in both 1954 and 1956. He was successful in his third bid in 1958, winning one of Allegheny County's allotted at-large seats by defeating former Steelers quarterback John \\"Harp\\" Vaughn. Foerster joined Leroy Irvis (who would go on to serve as the first African American Speaker of the State House) and State Senator Eugene Scanlon in a much-heralded freshman legislative class. While in the State House, he championed the cause of outdoorsmen and environmentalists, distinguishing himself by authoring Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law. Board of Commissioners Foerster was persuaded to run for one of the three seats on Allegheny County's Board of Commissioners in 1967. He received significant backing from the political machine of former Pittsburgh Mayor David Lawrence, whom Foerster had long admired. Lawrence, who had been elected Governor the same year Foerster won his State House seat, supported Forester and his running mate, former State Senator Leonard Staisey. Together, Staisey and Foerster toppled incumbent Democratic Commissioners William McClelland and John McGrady in the primary election. Foerster would go on to be re-elected to the Board of Commissioners a record six more times. In 1977, he was the Democratic nominee for Pittsburgh Mayor. However, he lost the general election to incumbent Mayor Richard Caliguiri, who ran as an independent. As Chairman, he initiated a plan to establish home rule in Allegheny County, which would replace the county commission with an elected County Executive and a County Council. This initiative was based upon a study set into motion by him and county commissioner Pete Flaherty in 1995. They established a committee chaired by the then Chancellor of Duquesne University, John E. Murray, Jr. called \\"ComPAC 21\\", (The Committee to Prepare Allegheny County for the 21st Century). Their report laid the plan for a completely new organizational structure of county government. The new form of government recommended by the study was advanced by the subsequent board, voted upon via a county-wide referendum, and officially instituted in 2000, and he became the first person to represent the 13th district on the Council, which replaced the County Board of Commissioners. He was defeated in the Democratic primary in his bid for an eighth term in 1995. That fall, Republicans Bob Cranmer and Larry Dunn both won seats on the Board, forming the first Republican majority in six decades. Commissioner Foerster in 1996 County Council In 1999, Foerster was elected to the Allegheny County Council, which was created by the enactment of Allgheny County's home rule charter in 1998. He became the first person to represent the 13th district on the Council, which replaced the County Board of Commissioners. Death Foerster died on January 11, 2000, just eleven days into his term, from complications of cardiac arrest and diabetes. He was 72 years old and had been in a coma for nearly a week. He was survived by his wife, Georgeann, and five stepchildren.

Born in Westerhope, he began his career in amateur football before joining Third Division North side Nelson in 1930. He made 14 senior appearances for the club and scored Nelson's last-ever goal in the Football League. Tebb went on to assist Wigan Borough and Lancaster Town and had an unsuccessful spell with Tottenham Hotspur. Biography Tebb was born in Westerhope, a mining village near Newcastle upon Tyne, in the first quarter of 1911. Aside from football, he was also a keen sprint runner. After retiring from professional football, he returned to live in Westerhope and died there on 23 June 1957, at the age of 46. Football career At the age of 16, Tebb started to play for Scotswood in the North Eastern League. In 1928 he was selected to represent \\"The Rest of the North Eastern League\\" in an exhibition match against the league champions, Sunderland Reserves. While at Scotswood, he had trial spells with Aston Villa and Hull City, but was not offered a contract by either club. In August 1929, Tebb transferred to North Eastern League First Division side Washington Colliery as was part of the team that finished 18th in the division in the 1929–30 season. His performances for Washington led to him being signed by Football League Third Division North club Nelson in June 1930. Tebb was one of several new signings acquired by Nelson in the summer of 1930, along with fellow forwards Arthur Bate and Leslie Raisbeck, as the club aimed to improve on a 19th-placed finish from the previous campaign. He made his debut for Nelson in the opening fixture of the 1930–31 season, playing at inside-left in the 4–5 defeat away at Rochdale. Tebb was dropped for the next three matches in favour of Arthur Hawes but returned on 13 September 1930, appearing at inside-right in place of Frank Allen as Nelson lost 0–1 at Halifax Town. He retained his place in the team for the following five games, but was then dropped again as manager Jack English made several changes for the trip to Crewe Alexandra on 18 October 1930.Dykes (2009), p. 84 Over the next five months Tebb made just one senior appearance, deputising for Hawes in the goalless draw with Rochdale at Seedhill on 27 December 1930. However, with Nelson bottom of the division and seven matches of the season remaining he was recalled to the starting line-up. He made his return for the visit of Wigan Borough on 3 April 1931 and scored the first goal in a 2–1 win. The victory proved to be Nelson's last of the season as the team lost its remaining six matches to finish 11 points adrift at the foot of the table. Tebb played in five of those defeats, and in his last appearance for Nelson in the penultimate game of the campaign he netted a consolation goal in the 1–5 loss away at Wrexham. The goal turned out to be Nelson's last in the Football League as their re-election application was unsuccessful and their place in the Third Division North was usurped by Chester. Along with many of the Nelson team, Tebb left Seedhill, preferring to stay in League football. He subsequently linked up with Wigan Borough in July 1931 and played six league matches for them before the club was wound-up midway through the season after suffering financial problems. Again without a club, Tebb joined Lancashire Combination outfit Lancaster Town in the summer of 1932. He spent one season at Lancaster, during which he was linked with a return to the Football League with Preston North End. Although the transfer never materialised, his return to professional football was confirmed when he signed with First Division side Tottenham Hotspur in June 1933. However, Tebb failed to break into the first team at White Hart Lane and was loaned out to Northfleet United two months later. After being released by Tottenham at the end of the 1933–34 season, Tebb returned to the North Eastern League with Blyth Spartans, where he ended his career.

The southwest of the Cricket Mountains merges southwest into the smaller San Francisco Mountains on the southern border of Sevier Lake and on the east of Wah Wah Valley. Description The Cricket Mountains rise to peaks ranging from the elevation to its highpoint of Headlight Mountain, ,Utah, DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer, p. 40-41. in the extreme southwest of the range. The Cricket Mountains are bordered by the Sevier Desert on the east, north, and west, where the Sevier River flows west then southwest into Sevier Lake, on the range's west border. The southwest of the range merges into the northeast of the San Francisco Mountains, a slightly smaller range. Both ranges trend southwesterly x northeast, presumably part of Basin and Range block faulting. Graymont Lime Graymont Lime has a plant in the Cricket Mountains, about southwest of Delta. It is one of the 10 largest lime plants in the United States. It was previously owned by Continental Lime, which was purchased by Graymont Lime.

Birth Born in Vale, Guernsey, Channel Islands, William Corbet was a member of the notable Corbet family of the Channel Islands. World War I Corbet served in World War I with the 2nd Royal Engineers in Wearside, Newcastle. His soldier number was 133579. He was honourably discharged in 1921. World War II The Great Escape Corbet was living back in Vale, Guernsey, Channel Islands when on 28 June 1940 the Germans invaded Guernsey and subsequently occupied the Channel Islands. Corbet was working as a Sea Pilot and Fisherman at the time. Within 3 years living conditions in Guernsey became almost unbearable and with his wife who was ill at the time and in need of medical assistance he decided to escape the island. He snuck minuscule amounts of gas fuel over a period of approximately one years accumulating enough to fill his vessel engine without the Germans noticing. On Saturday 14 August 1943 at approximately 3:30PM William Corbet set off from the Parish of St. Sampson's in his privately owned fishing vessel which measured 18 feet in length. He sailed near the rocky coastline harbour retrieving six other Guernsey residents where he arranged for them to board his vessel. In total 7 people boarded Corbet's boat \\"Kate\\". The other residents of the island were: Gertrude Corbet, Grace Le Morellec (Corbet's mother-in-law), Jack Hubert, Alfred Bougourd, and Mr. and Mrs Herbert Le Page. Corbet sailed quietly under the bright light of the moon drifting aimlessly after his engine broke down. The British Channel was eerily calm that night. In one instance the vessel passed dangerously by several German E-Boats and operation search lights but luckily Corbet and passengers were not seen; everyone hiding under blackened tarpaulins. Within 24 hours Corbet's vessel boat was spotted by a Royal Naval minesweeper who quickly identified the occupants as allies and safely brought the small vessel to the port of Dartmouth, England. Corbet was questioned by Royal Navy as were the six other escapees. Vital information from Corbet was supplied to the Royal Air Force about the poor living conditions under German Guernsey Occupation citing hunger, health issues and torture. This information proved vital to the Red Cross which helped in sending more humanitarian care to the island. Corbet credited his engineering abilities during World War I and his piloting skills in devising and safely reaching England. The British Admiralty offered an Honourable Commission to William Corbet but due to his wife's illness and advanced age he gratefully declined it. Results Once the German Forces found out about Corbet's escape a number of actions took place. The home and land of the escapees were confiscated and family arrested for questioning. Tighter rules were employed as to fishing licenses and curfews strictly enforced. Final years and death Corbet lived out his final years in England rarely discussing his escape. No credit was given by the States of Guernsey to Corbet for the information he provided to the British Forces which aided in assisting the island in receiving better care and conditions. William John Corbet died having changed the spelling of his surname from the use of one 't' to two (Corbett).

The bombing killed at least 30 people while 78 others were injured. Background The Khyber Agency market bombing was recorded to be the first major terrorist attack in the country since September 2011 when a Taliban suicide bomber had killed 46 people at a funeral in Lower Dir, targeting anti- Taliban militia members. Khyber Agency has experienced heavy conflict due to constant cross-border movement of militants connected to the War in Afghanistan. It used to serve as the main NATO supply route to Afghanistan until the closure of all supply lines by Pakistan in the wake of a NATO-led attack on Pakistani military checkposts which resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. Attack According to official sources, the bomb was triggered by a remote-controlled device and had been planted beforehand in a passenger pick-up van at a fuel station in the town near a vegetable market (bazaar). A local government administrator said the incident may have been a reaction to a successful military operation underway in Khyber Agency against insurgents and that the possible target of the attack may have been people of the Zakhakhel tribe who had formed a lashkar (armed militia) against Tehrik-i- Taliban militants. The bombing had hallmarks similar to earlier attacks carried out by insurgent groups. The injured were transported by ambulances to the Hayatabad Medical Complex, Khyber Teaching Hospital and Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. The area was closed and cordoned by security agencies for investigation following the explosion. Funeral prayers were held for the dead soon after the attack. A compensation of Rs. 1,00,000 was announced by authorities for heirs of the deceased victims and Rs. 25,000 for those who were injured. Responsibility A Taliban spokesman speaking via telephone from an undisclosed location denied that the Taliban had a role in the attack. Taliban spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan also disowned the attack in an email sent to the media. Local residents claimed that the nature of the bombing suggested that it was related more to a tribal dispute, since most of the victims of the blast were members of a tribe who opposed the notorious local warlord Mangal Bagh.Tribal dispute seen behind Jamrud blast Reactions Domestic * President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast and expressed grief over the loss of lives. * Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Amir Haider Khan Hoti condemned the incidentBlast in Jamrud claims 35 lives while Masood Kausar, the Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, also condemned the blast and called it an inhuman act in which innocent people were targeted. Kausar visited injured victims at a hospital. * Shahbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of Punjab gave his condemnations on the attack. * Imran Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) political party condemned the bombing and criticised the government, stating that the ignorance in maintaining rule of law by the country's leaders created a culture in which \\"the weak and the underprivileged become victims.\\" He added that if the PTI came into power, it would not spare those who violated law. International * : UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon condemned the bombing and issued his \\"heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and reiterates the continued solidarity of the United Nations with the people and government of Pakistan in their continuing efforts to confront terrorism and extremism.\\" * : In a statement, U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said the United States condemned the marketplace bombing and offered condolences for the dead victims: \\"By callously targeting innocent peoples, the extremists who planned and perpetrated this attack are just showing their contempt for the value of human life.\\" The U.S. embassy in Islamabad also released a press statement condemning the blast.

Its mission is to preserve the nation’s heritage for future generations through innovative leadership, education, and programs. History In 1973, the National Conservation Advisory Council was organized in November, funded by the National Museum Act of the Smithsonian Institution. The NCAC surveyed national needs and became the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property in 1982, and changed its name again to Heritage Preservation in 1997. One of its first major projects was called Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!). Initiated in 1989, the project is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor sculpture in the United States. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource. The Smithsonian Museum of American Art has become an active partner in the SOS! Project. The project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or “crowd-sourced” social media-driven initiatives. A second major project was a report produced in 2005 called the Heritage Health Index, which included data from more than 3,000 institutions, among them museums, historical societies, government archives, libraries, scientific organizations and universities. This report was funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The survey found that some 612 million artifacts - from photographs and paintings to nature specimens and pottery - are at risk of deterioration because they are not cared for properly. Programs * Rescue Public Murals seeks to bring public attention to U.S. murals, document their unique artistic and historic contributions, and secure the expertise and support to save them. * Since 1990, 2,600 museums have participated in the Conservation Assessment Program (CAP), including museums in all 50 states and the U. S. territories. Museums have the condition of their collections and historic structures assessed by professional conservators. CAP is administered by Heritage Preservation and funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. * Emergency Programs include the Heritage Emergency Task Force, a partnership of 41 national service organizations and federal agencies created to protect cultural heritage from the damaging effects of natural disasters and other emergencies. The Task Force was founded in 1995 and is co-sponsored by Heritage Preservation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. * Heritage Preservation bestows two annual awards. The Ross Merrill Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Preservation and Care of Collections is presented jointly by Heritage Preservation and the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. It recognizes an organization that has been exemplary in the importance and priority it has given to conservation concerns and in the sustained commitment it has shown to the preservation and care of cultural property. The CAA-Heritage Preservation Joint Award for Distinction in Scholarship and Conservation recognizes an outstanding contribution by one or more persons who have enhanced the understanding of art through the application of knowledge and experience in conservation, art history, and art.

His father was director of research at the ICI dyestuffs division in Blackley. He attended Manchester Grammar School and Manchester University in 1937 to read chemistry obtaining a BSc and MSc.Royal Society obituary accessed 11 January 2012 He was accepted as a PhD student by the Nobel prizewinner Alexander Todd. Career Todd's group did fundamental work on the chemistry of nucleosides, nucleotides and nucleic acids. This formed the base for subsequent work on the role of these compounds in cell biology and heredity. In 1944 he moved with Todd to Cambridge University and was awarded an ICI research fellowship. His work culminated in the first synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). He then joined the Wenner-Gren Institute (now the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research) in Stockholm with a fellowship from the Swedish Medical Research Council. Later at the Lister Institute in London he established the structure of several nucleotide coenzymes, in particular coenzyme A (CoA). He then attended Harvard with a Rockefeller fellowship. From 1954 to 1977 he was Professor of Organic Chemistry at King's College, University of Durham, now part of Newcastle University. From 1975 to 1983 he was Professor of Chemical Microbiology at Newcastle where he established the Microbiological Chemistry Research Laboratory (MCRL). The focus of his work was the biosynthesis, structure and biological function of various biochemical compounds, especially the discovery of teichoic acids, major components of cell wall structure of gram-positive bacteria. In 1981, Baddiley became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. After Newcastle he was awarded a senior research fellowship by the Science and Engineering Research Council, and moved to the biochemistry department at Cambridge. This led to the establishment of the Institute of Biotechnology of which he was the first chairman and he was also appointed a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Awards In 1961 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1963 as Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was awarded the Davy Medal in 1974 with the citation: In recognition of his distinguished researches on coenzyme A and studies of the constituents of bacterial cell walls. He was knighted in 1977.Obituary in The Independent 3 January 2009, accessed 10 January 2011 Other awards were DSc (Manchester), ScD (Cantab), and Honorary DSc's from Heriot-Watt University(1979) and also the University of Bath (1986). For his work at Newcastle University on teichoic acids, the recently built Baddiley-Clark building (housing bacterial cell biology research) was named in part after him. Personal life In 1944, married Hazel Townsend (d 2007) a textile designer. They had a son, Christopher.

It is the second film version of Zane Grey's novel, previously made in 1934 and also titled West of the Pecos starring Richard Dix. It is no relation to the 1922 silent film of the same name. Plot Colonel Lambreth's health is poor, so daughter Rill persuades him to leave his Chicago meat-packing business behind and move to their Texas cattle ranch. Her fiancé, lawyer Clyde Corbin, stays behind. On the trail, a couple of cowboys, Pecos Smith and sidekick Chito Rafferty, pull up to demand driver Tex Evans pay their back wages. After they ride off, the stagecoach is attacked by bandits. Circling back, the cowboys are told by the mortally wounded Tex that he was shot by Sam Sawtelle. The stage proceeds to town with Jeff Slinger at the reins. Rill, harassed in town, tucks her hair into her hat and disguises herself as a boy to be left alone. Brad Sawtelle, brother of Sam, organizes a posse of vigilantes to find Tex's killer. Pecos gets to Sam first and shoots him. The colonel and Rill get lost en route to their ranch. Pecos and Chito assist them and are offered jobs. Chito tries to woo the Lambreths' maid, Suzanne, but where Rill is concerned, Pecos still doesn't know she's a woman. Corbin comes to Texas and senses that Rill is now in love with someone else. Brad and his men believe Pecos to be an accomplice in the stagecoach robbery and murder. Pecos proves that the one responsible was Slinger, who is shot dead by Brad. A marshal places Brad under arrest and Rill and Pecos finally get to know each other better.

Early life Blaine was born in County Londonderry, Ireland in 1741, the son of James Blaine and his wife, Isabella.Houston et al., p. 333 The family moved to Pennsylvania in 1745 when Ephraim was four years old.Muzzey, p. 1 The Blaine family settled near the western frontier in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, later relocating to the east, in Cumberland County.Muzzey, p. 2 He received some schooling at Dr. Francis Alison's New London Academy in Chester County, then returned to the family homestead. In his early twenties, Blaine fought in the French and Indian War, and was among the defenders of Fort Pitt from the forces of Chief Pontiac in the subsequent Pontiac's War. After the wars ended and commerce resumed with the Native American tribes, Blaine began a career trading with them and became one of the wealthiest men in western Pennsylvania.Crapol, p. 1 Blaine married Rebecca Galbraith in 1765 and three sons, Robert, James, and David, were born to them in quick succession. Remaining in Cumberland County, Blaine was elected a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1770. From 1771 to 1773, he served as county sheriff.Minutes, p. 779 In 1774, he was chosen as a member of the county's Committee for Observation, which was formed to observe and address concerns with the royal government. Revolutionary War service In 1776, with the outbreak of war, Blaine was named chief commissary officer of the newly formed 8th Pennsylvania Regiment. Soon thereafter, Washington appointed Blaine commissary of purchases for the northern (or middle) department of the Continental Army.Rodenbough & Haskin, p. 69 In that position, Blaine helped to feed the Army that wintered at Valley Forge in 1777–1778. In 1777, Blaine was also made colonel of the Cumberland County militia. As commissary-general, Blaine traveled throughout the colonies to arrange food deliveries for the army, often having to advance his own money for payment.Muzzey, p. 3 After the war ended, Blaine returned to Carlisle and resumed his trading business, also engaging in land speculation. He remained out of the political arena, but did host Washington at his home in 1794 when the President was traveling west to confront the Whiskey Rebels. Washington and Blaine maintained a strong friendship until the former's death in 1799. Blaine's wife, Rebecca, died in 1795 and he married again, to Sarah Elizabeth Postlethwaite, in 1797. They had one son, also named Ephraim. Blaine died at his home in 1804. He is buried at Meetinghouse Springs Church near Carlisle.

He was born in Montelongo, Italy and emigrated to Montreal in 1958. Bibliography Marco Micone grew up in Montreal and since he was thirteen when he arrived he spoke, read and wrote in Italian. In high school, he read Gabrielle Roy's novel, Petite poule d'eau and discovered Quebec literature. He earned French degrees from Loyola College and McGill University where he wrote an M.A. thesis (1971) on the theatre of Marcel Dubé. He spent his professional career teaching Italian at Vanier College in Montreal, but was also involved in community and political activities as a spokesperson for immigrant issues. In the 1970s he joined the Parti Québécois, the nationalist movement in Quebec. Work in Theatre and Literature Micone wrote and staged his first French play, Gens du silence in 1980 and became a voice for the voiceless Italian immigrants of Quebec. It was published in 1982 and the English translation, Voiceless People in 1984. The English version was staged in Vancouver in 1986. The first French-language play to critically examine the immigrant conditions in Quebec it went on to achieve great success with repeated productions. Micone's dialectical style took a feminist turn with Addolorata staged in 1983 published in 1984, a play that focuses on the condition of immigrant women. The third play in Micone's trilogy, Déjà l'agonie staged 1986, published 1988, has a pessimistic tone as it considers the lost culture of the immigrant and the abandoned villages in Italy. He published a one-act play, Babele in 1989. Micone published a poem, Speak What 1989 in response to Michele Lalande's controversial poem, Speak White. Micone also published a book of biographical essays, Le Figuier enchanté(1992). Marco Micone worked as a French translator for theatres in Quebec and adapted a number of classical Italian plays for Montreal audiences among which are Pirandello's Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore(1992), Goldoni's La Locandiera (1993), La Serva amorosa (1997), Le donne di buon umore(2000), La vedova scaltra (2002), and Gozzi's Angelino belverde (1998). His translation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew produced in 1995 was given a feminist adaptation. Micone also published many magazine articles which engage in the controversies of Quebec politics and the conditions of immigrants in a nationalist society.

The band is one of the most recognized Chilean metal bands beyond Chile's borders. History Founding The group was founded in May 1989 by bassist and vocalist, Francisco Cautín. Infest Records In 1990, the band recorded its first demo, Kingdom of the Dark. and, two years later, signed a deal with the French label, Infest Records, subsequently recording the debut album, Oppressed by the Force. In 1995, the band recorded and released an EP in Spanish, entitled Los Últimos Tiempos. New members In March 1997, drummer Martín Valenzuela, with guitarists Sebastián Morales and Francisco Garcés, joined the band. In June 1998, with its new lineup, Torturer featured alongside Kreator (Germany), demonstrating its musical abilities to more than 3000 audience members. That same year the band recorded the Advance L.P. 1999. In September 1999, Garcés left the band and was replaced by Pablo Navarrete. Rise from the Ashes On May 25, 2001, Torturer released an album entitled Rise from the Ashes, symbolic of the band's absence from the public's attention and a subsequent \\"rebirth from the ashes\\" for the band. This album marked the return of the group to the music scene and was one of the band's most internationally recognized musical works. The concert for the album was documented with a 16-track recorder and the result was the band's first live recording, entitled Live from the Ashes (2002), which continued with the genre of \\"death metal-thrash\\" and was released on the Bloodbath Records label. In July of that year, Garcés returned to the band, with the intention of contributing to Torturer's fourth album. Apocalyptor Records signing The band signed with Australian label, Apocalyptor Records, to release a limited edition (500 copies) picture vinyl disc of Rise from the Ashes, an unprecedented occurrence for a Chilean band of any musical genre. The vinyl record was available in 2002 and the issue was solely targeted at fans of the band. On November 1, 2003, Torturer released its highly successful new album, entitled Purification of the Flames. The full-length recording includes seven original songs and one cover version of the legendary Sadus, a band that visited Chile in 2004 for the 15th anniversary of Torturer. 2007 release It was reported that the band had been working on material for a new album that was scheduled for a 2007 release. Current status In December 2010, Torturer was registered as an active band signed to the Rawforce Productions record label.

Life  Obentraut was born in Stromberg as the son of the Amtmann, Johan Bartel von Obentraut. He joined the army at an early age and is said to have been a formidable opponent because of his boldness. He initially served in the army of the Electorate of the Palatinate and joined Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, on whose side he had fought against the Turks in Hungary. Later, Johann Tserclaes would be his prime opponent. At the Battle of the White Mountain, Obentraut already fought on the Protestant side. He joined the Danish army and won battles at Frankenthal, Haguenau and Wiesloch.  Death in Seelze  His last victory occurred at Nienburg, when he served as lieutenant general of Duke John Ernest I of Saxe- Weimar. He prevented the army of the Catholic League, led by Johann Tserclaes, from occupying the town. After this success, Obentraut intended to take Calenberg Castle in Schulenburg near Pattensen, which Tserclaes had occupied. On his way there, his unit of 700 horsemen met an army of from Tserclaes's army at Seelze near Hanover. Obentraut rushed to the scene; legend has it that he was in such a hurry that he wore only one boot and no helmet. During the ensuing battle, he was hit by a fatal bullet. He died in the presence of his Tserclaes, his former brother in arms. Legend has it that Tserclaes closed Obentraut's eyes. Obentraut's body was held at Calenberg Castle for four months, before he was exchanged for a leading officer. His body was then transferred to the St. Aegidius Church in Hanover. Two years later, he was finally buried in the Market Church, also in Hanover.  Obentraut Monument  The Obentraut monument in Seelze A 6-meter-high monument was erected in Seelze at the spot where Obentraut was wounded mortally. It was made in 1630 by the sculptor Jeremias Sutel (1587–1631) form Hanover. It is unknown who commissioned the monument. The monument carries an inscription in Latin and the quote dedicated to the highest and best God. In 1989, an oversized metal riding boot and a helmet were installed next to the monument. They point to the items Obentraut was missing when he threw himself into the fray. The main thoroughfare through Seelze passes by this monument in the town center.  German Michel  Legend has it that Tserclaes's Spanish troops were awed by his bravery and called him Deutscher Michel. However, no proof of this story has been found in either Spanish or German contemporary sources. The first author to mention it was Philipp Andreas Oldenburger in 1668, in a book published under the pseudonym Philipp Andreas Burgoldensis. Oldenburg's reputation as a scientist was somewhat controversial during his lifetime.  References   Non-fiction  * [Anonymous]: Stromberg am Soonwald feiert seinen großen Sohn vom 6. bis 9.

While not denying that some form of primacy could exist for the Bishop of Rome, Orthodox Christians argue that the tradition of Rome's primacy in the early Church was not equivalent to the current doctrine of supremacy. Orthodox understanding of Catholicity The test of authentic catholicity is adherence to the authority of the Church's Holy Tradition, and then to the witness of Sacred \\"Scripture\\", which is itself a product of the Church's aforementioned Holy Tradition. It is not defined by adherence to any particular See. It is the position of the Orthodox Church that it has never accepted the pope as de jure leader of the entire church. All bishops are equal \\"as Peter\\", therefore every church under every bishop (consecrated in apostolic succession) is fully complete (the original meaning of catholic). Referring to Ignatius of Antioch,Epistle to the Smyrnaeans - Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop. Carlton says The church is in the image of the TrinityLossky, V., (2002) The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, (St Vladimirs Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY), p.176 and reflects the reality of the incarnation. Any changes to the understanding of the church would reflect a change in the understanding of the Trinity. Orthodox rebuttal of Catholic arguments It is the position of Orthodox Christianity that Roman Catholic arguments in support of the teaching have relied on proofs from Fathers that have either been misinterpreted or so taken out of context as to misrepresent their true intent. It is the position of Orthodox Christianity that a closer examination of those supposed supports would have the effect of either not supporting the argument or have the opposite effect of supporting the counter- argument. Apostolic Throne Athanasius is used as a witness for papal primacy on numerous Catholic apologist sites. Whelton however says that Athanasius does not use the definite article (the) in the text.Whelton, M., (2006) Popes and Patriarchs: An Orthodox Perspective on Roman Catholic Claims, (Concillar Press; Ben Lomond, CA), pp63-4. Rome is an Apostolic throne, not the Apostolic throne. Augustine too is misquoted on the same point of grammar ... Pope Leo XIII Augustine Whelton goes on to say that for Augustine there is not one Apostolic See, but many: Ignatius of Antioch For Ignatius each church under a bishop is complete – the original meaning of \\"catholic\\". For Ignatius the church is a world-wide unity of many communities. Each has at its center a bishop \\"who draws together the local community in the Eucharistic celebration.\\"Empie, P. C., & Murphy, T. A., (1974) Papal Primacy and the Universal Church: Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue V (Augsburg Publishing House; Minneapolis, MN) p47. This then is the unity of the church – each church united to its bishop – each of these churches united to each other. There is no evidence of him accepting a single supreme bishop-of- bishops as the bishop's authority is localised to a particular church.Srawley, J. H., (1910) The epistles of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, Volume 1, (Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; London), p. 34 C. Carlton sums up Ignatius's view of the bishop's role in the Church this way: Ignatius sets out what he believes consists of the church in an epistle to the Trallians: There is no reference to another tier above bishop. For Ignatius, the bishop is supreme, not the bishop because he is in communion with the bishop in Rome.\\"It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would look upon the Lord Himself.\\" Ignatius, Epistle to the Ephesians - Chapter VI - Have respect to the bishop as to Christ Himself.\\"He who honors the bishop has been honored by God; he who does anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve the devil.\\" Ignatius Epistle to the Smyrneans - Chapter IX.—Honour the bishop.\\"As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, \\"I can of mine own self do nothing,\\" so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop\\" Ignatius Epistle to the Magnesians - Chapter VII —Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters.\\"For your justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp.\\" IgnatiusEpistle to the Ephesians – Chapter IV – the same continued.\\"And do ye also reverence your bishop as Christ Himself, according as the blessed apostles have enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure, wherefore also he is obedient to the bishop and presbyters: but he that is without is one that does anything apart from the bishop, the presbyters, and the deacons. Such a person is defiled in his conscience, and is worse than an infidel. For what is the bishop but one who beyond all others possesses all power and authority, so far as it is possible for a man to possess it who according to his ability has been made an imitator of the Christ of God?\\" Ignatius Epistle to the Trallians. Chapter VII.— The same continued. Thus when he writes to Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna, he states that God is Polycarp’s bishop, implying that there is no intermediary between the local bishop and God.Epistle to Polycarp. \\"Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to Polycarp, Bishop of the Church of the Smyrnæans, or rather, who has, as his own bishop, God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: [wishes] abundance of happiness\\" John Chrysostom referred to Ignatius of Antioch as a \\"teacher equivalent to Peter\\".Homilies on S. Ignatius and S. Babylas – Eulogy \\"... when Peter was about to depart from here, the grace of the Spirit introduced another teacher equivalent to Peter ...\\" Eulogy quoted in Abbé Guettée (1866).The Papacy: Its Historic Origin and Primitive Relations with the Eastern Churches, (Minos Publishing Co; NY), p165. Letter to the Romans Ignatius' Epistle to the Romans is used by Catholic apologists to suggest Roman primacy.Ray, S. K., (1999) Upon this rock: St. Peter and the primacy of Rome in scripture and the early church, (Ignatius Press; San Francisco), p. 72 In particular his opening remarks: J.H. Srawley concedes that the Roman church presides but argues that it is unclear as to what area the act of presiding (\\"presides in the place of the region of the Romans\\" and \\"presides over love\\") refers to. He argues that the act of presiding may be simply of those churches in the region of the Romans, that is, those in Italy.Srawley, J. H., (1919), The Epistles of St Ignatius (The Macmillan Company; NY), p. 70 Tome of Leo Often cited as a proof of Papal SupremacyRay, S. K., (1999) Upon this rock: St. Peter and the primacy of Rome in scripture and the early church, (Ignatius Press; San Francisco) p. 235The Authority of the Pope: Part II at Catholic AnswersIS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH APOSTOLIC ? Catholic Apologetics is the Tome of Leo which is a letter sent by Pope Leo to the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Chalcedon in 451. It in part seems to suggest that Leo speaks with the authority of Peter. It is the position of Orthodox Christianity that the approval of the Tome is simply to state a unity of faith, not only of the pope but other churchmen as well. Before the Tome of Leo was presented to the Council, it was submitted to a committee headed by Patriarch St. Anatolius of Constantinople for study. The committee compared the Tome of Leo to the 12 Anathemas of St. Cyril of Alexandria against Nestorius and declared the Tome orthodox. It was then presented to the council for approval. However it is not just Leo's teaching that is the teaching of the Apostle, but Cyril's teaching as well. Both teach as Peter. The same language was used following the reading of Cyril's letter at the council.\\"And when these letters had been read, the most reverend bishops cried out: We all so believe: Pope Leo thus believes: anathema to him who divides and to him who confounds: this is the faith of Archbishop Leo: Leo thus believes: Leo and Anatolius so believe: we all thus believe. As Cyril so believe we, all of us: eternal be the memory of Cyril: as the epistles of Cyril teach such is our mind, such has been our faith: such is our faith: this is the mind of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written. Extracts from the Acts. Session II. (Continued). (L. and C., Conc., Tom. IV., col. 343.) The language of the council is simply to reinforce that all believe.Whelton, M., (2006) Popes and Patriarchs: An Orthodox Perspective on Roman Catholic Claims, (Concillar Press; Ben Lomond, CA). pp. 85ff At the Third Ecumenical Council Pope Celestine and Cyril were compared to Paul.\\"And all the most reverend bishops at the same time cried out. This is a just judgment. To Cœlestine, a new Paul! To Cyril a new Paul! To Cœlestine the guardian of the faith! To Cœlestine of one mind with the synod! To Cœlestine the whole Synod offers its thanks! One Cœlestine! One Cyril! One faith of the Synod! One faith of the world!\\"Extracts from the Acts. Session II.(Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. III., col. 617.) John Chrysostom Another apparent witness for supremacy claims is John Chrysostom. This evidence is supposed to be based on an incident when he faced exile and he appealed to the pope for help. When he was to be exiled he appealed to the pope for help, as well as two other western prelates; Venerius of Milan and Chromatius of Aquileia. He appealed to all three in the same terms rather than viewing the pope as leader.Stephens, W. R. W., (2005)Saint Chrysostom: His Life and Times, (Elibron Classics), pp. 349-50 In 2007 Pope Benedict XVI also spoke of this: Historian J. N. D Kelly wrote: The pope took up the cause of John Chrysostom, convoking a western synod to investigate the matter.Palladius, (1985) Dialogue on the Life of John Chrysostom (Newman Press; NY) p.24 They found in favor of John Chrysostom and sent delegates to Constantinople but these were ignored and sent back after only three months.Ibid. pp. 29–30. The pope's findings in support of John Chrysostom were not viewed as serious enough to annul John Chrysostom's exile. It must also be remembered that he took his vows from Meletius (whom we noted earlier was not in communion with Rome). He accepted as an authority men not in communion with Rome. After Meletius died John Chrysostom accepted Flavian as his bishopSocrates Scholasticus The Ecclesiastical History Book V.9 \\\\- another person not in communion with Rome.Puller, F. W., (1893),The Primitive Saints and the See of Rome, (Longmans, Green & Co; NY), p. 266 John Chrysostom spent much of his life not in communion with Rome. Other texts are used to allege he supported Roman primacy. John Chrysostom sometimes ascribes to Peter greatness. This would seem to indicate that Chrysostom taught that Peter was the supreme ruler over the \\"brethren\\". He goes on to ascribe Peter as the \\"teacher of the world\\".\\"And if any should say 'How then did James receive the chair at Jerusalem?' I would make this reply, that He appointed Peter teacher not of the chair, but of the world ... And this He did to withdraw them (Peter and John) from their unseasonable sympathy for each other; for since they were about to receive the charge of the world, it was necessary that they should no longer be closely associated together.\\" John Chrysostom Ibid. However, according to Abbé Guettée on other occasions John Chrysostom ascribes the same titles to others:Abbé Guettée (1866). The Papacy: Its Historic Origin and Primitive Relations with the Eastern Churches, (Minos Publishing Co; NY), pp. 156ff. Denny also notes that John Chrysostom goes on to speak of Paul as being on an equal footing with Peter.Denny, E., (1912) Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), pp. 84ff\\"Where the Cherubim sing the glory, where the Seraphim are flying, there shall we see Paul, with Peter, and as chief and leader of the choir of the saints, and shall enjoy his generous love ... I love Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it ... Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the city of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be caught up, thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder, at the thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together with Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. What a rose will Rome send up to Christ! ... what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be girded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, nor for the columns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church (1 Cor. 15:38 ).\\"- John Chrysostom Homilies on the Epistle to the Romans, Homily 32, Ver. 24 quoted in Abbé Guettée (1866). The Papacy: Its Historic Origin and Primitive Relations with the Eastern Churches, (Minos Publishing Co.; NY), p157. Further, the Catholic encyclopedia offers this frank admission of his writings: Basil the Great Basil the Great also supported Meletius against Rome's candidate.Whelton, M., (2006)Popes and Patriarchs: An Orthodox Perspective on Roman Catholic Claims, (Concillar Press; Ben Lomond, CA), p. 120 Writing to Count Terentius Basil said From his letters it appears that Basil did not hold the popes in high esteem. When Basil wrote to the west for help (in combating Arianism) he addressed his letters to the whole western church.Letter XC -To the holy brethren the bishops of the West He didn't especially write to Rome for help and did not even list it first. Damasus was the leader of a group supporting the heretic Marcellus Of the pope, St Basil wrote Coryphæus Coryphæus means the head of the choir. Catholic apologists note that John Chrysostom uses the term to describe Peter.Ray, S. K., (1999) Upon this rock: St. Peter and the primacy of Rome in scripture and the early Church, (Ignatius Press; San Francisco), pp. 219-220 However he also uses this term in relation to others: It is argued by Catholics that John Chrysostom only uses the singular Coryphæus in relation to Peter. This is true, but others do not restrict the use of the singular to Peter. Basil also uses the term Coryphæus. He refers to Athanasius as \\"Coryphæus of all.\\"Letter LXIX in Denny, E., (1912) Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), p. 335 He refers to Pope Damasus as Coryphæus, but as the leader of the westerners, not of the whole church. Hesychius of Jerusalem uses the term Coryphæus to refer to James.Denny, E., (1912)Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), p. 85 Maximus the Confessor Pope Leo XIII has already been shown to have misquoted Athanasius. Whelton states that (in his encyclical Satis cognitum) he misquotes Maximus the Confessor.Whelton, M., (2006) Popes and Patriarchs: An Orthodox Perspective on Roman Catholic Claims, (Concillar Press; Ben Lomond, CA)., p. 125 In Defloratio ex Epistola ad Petrum illustrem Maximus (also rendered Maximos) is alleged to have said: Edward Denny giving his own translation and using that of VincenziVincenzi, L, (1875) De Hebraeorum et Christianorum Sacra Monarchia shows that the words of Maximus give Rome a power conferred upon it by Holy Synods. This is in contrast with Catholic teaching and also would suggest that if a Synod can confer power, it can also take it away. Denny states that Vincenzi is \\"compelled by the facts to admit that these very authorities to which St Maximus refers, as they have been handed down to us, are witness against the Papal Monarchy.\\"Denny, E., (1912)Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), p. 327 Formula of Pope Hormisdas Under the emperor Anastasius I, the churches of Constantinople and Rome were in schism. However with the ascendency of the orthodox emperor Justin I, the two churches could be reconciled again. Justin ordered negotiations begin. Pope Hormisdas issued a formula of orthodox catholic faith which the Patriarch John II could sign if he wished reunion of the two churches. Catholic apologists emphasize part of the text bolded above. Those in agreement with orthodox faith would naturally be in agreement with the church in Rome on this matter – which was stating orthodox faith. For Catholic apologists agreement to this text means an agreement to Rome, because Rome is the leader. For Orthodox agreement to Rome is because it stated the truth. Further evidence seems to point to this. Patriarch John expressed his opinion that Rome (Old Rome) and Constantinople (New Rome) were on the same level.Dvornik, F., (1966) Byzantium and the Roman Primacy, (Fordham University Press, NY), p.61. The Patriarch showed this when he added to the document: Furthermore despite it being one of the demands in the formula the east continued to disregard papal demands by not condemning Acacius. Meyendorff, J., (1989) Imperial Unity and Christian Divisions: The Church AD450-680. (St Valdimir's Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY) p215. In doing so John was re- affirming Canon XXVIII of the Council of Chalcedon - a canon which the popes were not to affirm for many centuries to come. The politics of this is demonstrated by the fact that the Emperor Justin ignored the pope's candidate for the vacated see of Alexandria and instead \\"authorised the consecration of Timothy III, an intransigent Monophysite\\".Davis, L. D., (1990), The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787) Their History and Theology(Liturgical Press, Minnesota), p. 223 Theoderic, king in Italy, and an Arian grew suspicious of the new alliance between Rome and Constantinople. John who succeeded as pope was sent to Constantinople to restore Arian churches there. Thus the orthodox Catholic pope was sent to urge the restoration of churches to heretics. This the pope did with limited success.Ibid., p. 224Meyendorff, J., (1989) Imperial Unity and Christian Divisions: The Church AD450-680 (St Valdimir's Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY) p220. Having failed, upon his return the pope was arrested and died in prison. This then is not the capitulation of the eastern churches to Roman authority. It is not even the capitulation of the church in Constantinople – as other eastern churches ignored the formula completely. The popes did not have authority over the church and in fact were forced to go and plead the case of heretics before the imperial throne. Opposition arguments from early church history * The church at Rome was founded (or more formally organised) by both Peter and Paul. As no particular charism or primacy attaches to Paul, then it is not from his co-foundation of the church of Rome that the Roman Pontiff claims primacy. * As many Sees are of Peter, Peter serves as an archetype of \\"Apostle\\". * While the See of Rome had primacy, it was a position of honour rather than power or magisterial authority. * Rome is an Apostolic throne, not the Apostolic throne. * Each bishop has the right to manage affairs within his local diocese. In the event of a dispute with another bishop, only a general council may rule on the matter. * Church Fathers do not refer to another tier or clerical office above the ordinary episcopate. * Cases which had been decided by Rome were appealed to bishops in other metropolitan areas. * Cases which had been decided by Rome were appealed to synods of bishops in other metropolitan areas. * Peter founded many episcopal sees; all such sees have equal standing. * The Apostles were equal; no authority was withheld from any of them. * The Roman Pontiff is also styled \\"universal bishop\\" (), but a previous Pope condemned the use of such a title by any bishop. * The post-Constantinian church conferred upon the sees of Old Rome and later New Rome (Constantinople) the same degree of honor. * Eastern Patriarchs have regarded the Bishop of Rome, occupying the only apostolic see in Western Christendom, as the Patriarch of the West (not of the entire church). * Faced with exile, John Chrysostom, the Archbishop of Constantinople, wrote an appeal for help to three Western churchmen. While one of these was the bishop of Rome, had Rome exercised primacy at that time, he would not have written to the other two bishops. \\"Keys of the Kingdom\\" Orthodox Christians accept that Peter had a certain primacy. In the New Testament, he is first to be given the keys . However other texts may be interpreted to imply that the other Apostles also received the keys in . Such an interpretation, it is claimed, Webster, W. (1995), The Church of Rome at the Bar of History, (The Banner of Truth Trust; Edinburgh), pp43ff has been accepted by many Church Fathers; Tertullian,\\"What, now, (has this to do) with the Church, and) your (church), indeed, Psychic? For, in accordance with the person of Peter, it is to spiritual men that this power will correspondently appertain, either to an apostle or else to a prophet.\\" On Modesty. Book VII. Chapter XXI Hilary of Poitiers,\\"This faith it is which is the foundation of the Church; through this faith the gates of hell cannot prevail against her. This is the faith which has the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatsoever this faith shall have loosed or bound on earth shall be loosed or bound in heaven. This faith is the Father's gift by revelation; even the knowledge that we must not imagine a false Christ, a creature made out of nothing, but must confess Him the Son of God, truly possessed of the Divine nature.\\"On the Trinity. Book VI.37 John Chrysostom,\\"For (John) the Son of thunder, the beloved of Christ, the pillar of the Churches throughout the world, who holds the keys of heaven, who drank the cup of Christ, and was baptized with His baptism, who lay upon his Master’s bosom, with much confidence, this man now comes forward to us now\\"Homilies on the Gospel of John. Preface to Homily 1.1 Augustine.\\"He has given, therefore, the keys to His Church, that whatsoever it should bind on earth might be bound in heaven, and whatsoever it should loose on earth might be, loosed in heaven; that is to say, that whosoever in the Church should not believe that his sins are remitted, they should not be remitted to him; but that whosoever should believe and should repent, and turn from his sins, should be saved by the same faith and repentance on the ground of which he is received into the bosom of the Church. For he who does not believe that his sins can be pardoned, falls into despair, and becomes worse as if no greater good remained for him than to be evil, when he has ceased to have faith in the results of his own repentance.\\"On Christian Doctrine Book I. Chapter 18.17 The Keys Given to the Church.\\"... Peter, the first of the apostles, receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven for the binding and loosing of sins; and for the same congregation of saints, in reference to the perfect repose in the bosom of that mysterious life to come did the evangelist John recline on the breast of Christ. For it is not the former alone but the whole Church, that bindeth and looseth sins; nor did the latter alone drink at the fountain of the Lord's breast, to emit again in preaching, of the Word in the beginning, God with God, and those other sublime truths regarding the divinity of Christ, and the Trinity and Unity of the whole Godhead.\\"On the Gospel of John.

(Rabbinic Judaism only prescribes Noahide Laws for gentiles.) Catholic historians note that when Peter spoke, all were silent. However Whelton notes that when Paul and James spoke, all were silent as well.Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.36 Eusebius said that it was James who stated the decision of the Council, not Peter. quoted in John Chrysostom noted James made the decision.\\"This (James) was bishop, as they say, and therefore he speaks last ... There was no arrogance in the Church. After Peter, Paul speaks, and none silences him: James waits patiently; not starts up (for the next word). No word speaks John here, no word the other Apostles, but held their peace, for James was invested with the chief rule, and think it no hardship. So clean was their soul from love of glory. Peter indeed spoke more strongly, but James here more mildly: for thus it behooves one in high authority, to leave what is unpleasant for others to say, while he himself appears in the milder part.\\" John ChrysostomHomilies on the Acts of the Apostles, Homily 33 quoted in Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy -Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.38.\\"But observe how Peter does everything with the common consent; nothing imperiously.\\" John Chrysostom Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles Homily III on Acts 1:12 quoted in Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.33 The ruling of the Council was expressed as being the decision of all the council, not just Peter. Continuing with this the opening statements of official formulations normally begins with the phrase \\"Following the Holy Fathers\\", not \\"Following the ruling of the Pope.\\"Chrestou, P.

Victor was rebuked by Irenaeus for this severity and it seems that he revoked his sentence and that communion was preserved.\\"Joint Coordinating Committee for the Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church (Aghios Nikolaos, Crete, Greece, 27 September - 4 October 2008), \\"The Role of the Bishop of Rome in the Communion of the Church in the First Millennium\\" Eusebius wrote: The matter will be eventually resolved at the First Ecumenical Council in line with Sunday observance.  Orthodox arguments from Church Councils  * Not one Ecumenical Council was called by a pope; all were called by Byzantine emperors. Had the teaching of primacy formed part of Holy Tradition, then such power would have been exercised to resolve the many disputes in the early history of the church. * A general council may overrule decisions of the Roman Pontiff * Decisions taken by popes in cases involving against bishops have often been confirmed by ecumenical councils. This indicates that the papal decision itself is not considered binding.  First Ecumenical Council  Arius and his teachings were condemned by a synod of bishops which the pope summoned in 320. Alexander of Alexandria summoned a local synod in Alexandria in 321 which also condemned Arianism.Protopresbyter George Dion. Dragas, (2005), Saint Athanasius of Alexandria: Original Research and New Perspectives, (Orthodox Research Institute; Rollinsford, NH), p. 195 Five years after the pope had condemned Arianism, Emperor Constantine I called an ecumenical council to settle the matter. Whelton argues that the pope's decision was not considered an end to the matter because a council in Africa met to examine the issue for itself. Constantine then ordered a larger council to decide on the matter.Whelton, M., (2006) Popes and Patriarchs: An Orthodox Perspective on Roman Catholic Claims, (Concillar Press; Ben Lomond, CA), pp83ff The Fourth Canon of this council confirmed that bishops were to be appointed only locally.\\"It is by all means proper that a bishop should be appointed by all the bishops in the province; but should this be difficult, either on account of urgent necessity or because of distance, three at least should meet together, and the suffrages of the absent [bishops] also being given and communicated in writing, then the ordination should take place. But in every province the ratification of what is done should be left to the Metropolitan.\\"Canon IV. of the First Ecumenical Council at CCEL This is in contrast with Catholic canon law that allows the pope (should he wish) to interfere in the appointment of church officers at any level.  Second Ecumenical Council  The Second Ecumenical Council was presided over by Meletius of Antioch, who was not in communion with Rome.Empie, P. C., & Murphy, T. A., (1974) Papal Primacy and the Universal Church: Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue V(Augsburg Publishing House; Minneapolis, MN), p82.  Third Ecumenical Council  The Third Ecumenical Council called Nestorius to account for his teachings following his condemnation as a heretic by Pope Celestine I. The council did not consider the papal condemnation as definitive.Ibid., p153.Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.59. Catholic theologian Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet noted Bishop Maret said St Vincent of Lerins In its condemnation of Nestorius, the language given is of the council ruling, not because the pope said so. Cyril writes that he, and his fellow bishop - the pope - had both condemned Nestorius.Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius with the XII Anathematisms Catholic apologists Fathers Rumble and Carty stated It is true that the statement was made at the council. It is however not a \\"decree\\". It was a statement by a priest during the deliberations of the council. This priest, Philip, was at the council to represent the pope. It was not a decree or finding made by the council and remains his opinion.quoted in Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), pp56-7.  Fourth Ecumenical Council  The Fourth Ecumenical Council was called against the expressed wishes of the pope.quoted in Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.50.  Fifth Ecumenical Council  A controversy arose out of the writings known as Three Chapters – written by bishops Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas. Pope Vigilius opposed the condemnation of the Three Chapters. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council (553) the assembled bishops condemned and anathematized Three Chapters. After the council threatened to excommunicate him and remove him from office, Vigilius changed his mind – blaming the devil for misleading him.Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), pp68ff. Bossuet wrote German theologian Karl Josef von Hefele notes that the council was called \\"without the assent of the Pope\\".Hefele, Karl Joseph von, History of the Councils, Vol. IV., p. 289  Sixth Ecumenical Council  At the Sixth Ecumenical Council, both Pope Honorius and Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople were declared heretics.Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p.72.

The Catholic Encyclopedia states: So too the Seventh Ecumenical Council declared its adhesion to the anathema in its decree of faith. Thus an Ecumenical Council could rule on the faith of a pope and expel him from the church.Even kings could sit in judgment of popes, such as recorded in the chronicles Annales Romani record the events thus: \\"Henry, most victorious king by the grace of God ... When he arrived at the city of Sutri, he called the Roman clergy along with Pope Gregory to meet with him. He ordered a special synod to be held in the holy church of Sutri and there, lawfully and canonically, he sat in judgment upon Bishop John of Sabina, called Silvester; the archpriest John, called Gregory; and the aforementioned Pope Benedict.\\" See Annales Romani–Description of the Synod of Sutri - in Miller, M.

Western councils Filioque In 809, when Pope Leo III was asked to approve the addition to the Nicene Creed of the Filioque, first included by the Third Council of Toledo (589) and later adopted widely in Spain, the Frankish empire and England, he refused:Sergeĭ Nikolaevich Bulgakov, The Comforter (Eerdmans 2004 ), p. 92Andrew Louth, Greek East and Latin West (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2007 ), p. 142 The claim that Pope John VIII also condemned the addition of the FilioqueRomanides, J., (2004) An Outline of Orthodox Patristic Dogmatics (Orthodox Research Institute; Rollinsford, NH), p33. is disputed.Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, vol. 5, part 1, \\"The Enlargement of the Nicene Creed\\", footnote 590 Philip Schaff says there are different opinions about when the addition was accepted in Rome, whether by Pope Nicholas I (858-867), Pope Sergius III (904-911) or, as is most commonly believed, by Pope Benedict VIII (1014–1015). When arguing \\"that so far from the insertion being made by the Pope, it was made in direct opposition to his wishes and command\\", he expresses himself more decidedly: Council of Frankfurt The Council of Frankfurt was held in 794. \\"Two papal legates were present, Theophylact and Stephen.\\"The Council of Frankfort at the Catholic Encyclopaedia Despite the presence of papal representatives it still repudiated the terms of the Seventh Ecumenical Council – despite the fact that the Seventh was accepted by the pope.Whelton, M., (1998) ‘'Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition'’, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MD), p.78. Rome's supposed primacy The first pope The Catholic church states that Rome's supremacy rests on the pope being given power handed down from the first pope – Peter.Catholic Catechism - 882: The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, \\"is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful.\\" \\"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered.\\" However there is evidence that Peter was not the first bishop, and that the church in Rome was founded (or organized)There were already Christians in Rome when Peter and Paul arrived therefore it is suggested that they organized the existing community of believers, rather thanfounding the community – See Neill, S., (1984) A History of Christian Missions, (Penguin History; London), p.22 by Peter and Paul together. \\"Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.\\" Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions, Book 7, Chapter XLVI – Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?

Primacy based on Peter and Paul Rome had primacy, but it was one of honor, rather than power. The reasons for this are varied. One being that it was a See founded by both Peter and Paul. This honor was given not because of the 'primacy' of Peter (which is Catholic teaching), but on the position of both Peter and Paul. This was the accepted position, even in the west. :Pope Leo the Great Augustine\\"For Rome, in a specially honorable and solemn manner, commends the merits of Peter and of Paul, for this reason among others, namely, that they suffered [martyrdom] on the same day.\\" Augustine \\"The Harmony of the Gospels\\". Book I. Chapter X.—Of Some Who are Mad Enough to Suppose that the Books Were Inscribed with the Names of Peter and Paul and Theodoret\\"But on your city the great Provider has bestowed an abundance of good gifts. She is the largest, the most splendid, the most illustrious of the world, and overflows with the multitude of her inhabitants. Besides all this, she has achieved her present sovereignty, and has given her name to her subjects. She is moreover specially adorned by her faith, in due testimony whereof the divine Apostle exclaims \\"your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. And if even after receiving the seeds of the message of salvation her boughs were straightway heavy with these admirable fruits, what words can fitly praise the piety now practised in her? In her keeping too are the tombs that give light to the souls of the faithful, those of our common fathers and teachers of the truth, Peter and Paul This thrice blessed and divine pair arose in the region of sunrise, and spread their rays in all directions. Now from the region of sunset, where they willingly welcomed the setting of this life, they illuminate the world. They have rendered your see most glorious; this is the crown and completionof your good things; but in these days their God has adorned their throne.\\" TheodoretLetter CXIII. To Leo, Bishop of Rome also wrote on the greatness of Rome – but for being the largest city, and its foundation on Peter and Paul. Rome's degree of 'primacy' was affirmed by one hundred and fifty bishops meeting at the Council of Chalcedon.\\"Following in all things the decisions of the holy Fathers, and acknowledging the canon, which has been just read, of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who assembled in the imperial city of Constantinople, which is New Rome, in the time of the Emperor Theodosius of happy memory), we also do enact and decree the same things concerning the privileges of the most holy Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome. For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, - Canon XXVIII The Fourth Ecumenical Council. The Council of Chalcedon. For this council Rome's primacy rested on the fact it was once the imperial capital. Canon XXVIII of the Council of Chalcedon This canon above comes up in numerous discussions on Papal Supremacy. For Orthodox it demonstrates a fluidity to the placing of honors – it shows Constantinople's place of honor moving up higher than older Sees such as Jerusalem, Alexandria and, Antioch. Pope Leo I protested against the inclusion of this canon and refused to sign agreement to it. The Catholic encyclopaedia says The pope protested on behalf of two other Sees' privileges, not on a matter of his own power. However despite his energetic protests the canon remained adhered to by the eastern churches. It was confirmed in the east at the Council of Trullo in 692, where the four major eastern patriarchs attended; Paul of Constantinople, Peter of Alexandria, Anastasius of Jerusalem, George of Antioch. Thus despite the wishes of the pope the eastern churches ignored his protests. Eventually it was accepted in the West. In 1215 at the Fourth Council of the Lateran the Roman church accepted Constantinople's position – albeit when Constantinople was in western hands following the Fourth Crusade. Subsequently at the Council of Florence this was confirmed to the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople. Rome as an archetype church The church in Rome is occasionally singled out. Tertullian With no special charism associated with Paul, he is quietly ignored by Catholic apologists as a founder of the See of Rome. Or his part is acknowledged but merely in passing because the theory of the pope's authority has no place for Paul's role in the foundation of the Roman church. Rome serves as an example, but so do the other apostolic churches. Again, reflecting Ignatius' thoughts on catholic it is noted that the many churches each are 'one'. Cyprian Equality of the Apostles Peter and Paul taught the same as each other. All the Apostles were the foundation (rock) of the church. Nothing was withheld from any of the Apostles. When they preached they did so with equal knowledge. Peter preached to the Jews as Paul preached to the Gentiles Abbe Guetée The Papacy, p. 11 . :Tertullian :John Chrysostomon Cyril of Alexandria \\"Rock\\" Orthodox Christians believe all people can share in God. In a process called Theosis. We are all called to be rock. That is to share in the same nature. Thus from the earliest times the foundation of the church can be said to be; the faith; Jesus; the Apostles, not just Peter. :The Shepherd of Hermas :The Divine Liturgy of James the Apostle and brother of God Peter is referred to as rock but other Christian writers use the term in describing others; Hippolytus of Rome;The Extant Works and Fragments of Hippolytus, Part I Victorinus of Pettau;Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John, From the Twenty-First and Twenty-Second Chapters Gregory of Nyssa;Panegyric on St. Stephen, M.P.G., Vol. 46, Col. 733 Hilary of Poitiers;On The Trinity, Book VI.33 Jerome;6th Book on MatthewBasil the Great;De Spiritu Sancto, Chapter VIII Gregory Thaumaturgus;Part II.\\"Dubious or Spurious Writings, A Sectional Confession of Faith\\", Chapter XXII Ambrosiaster;Commentary on Ephesians, M.P.L., Vol. 17, Col. 380 Aphraates;The 'Demonstrations' of Aphrahat Athanasius;Letters of Athanasius, Letter 29 Origen;Commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew Book XII.11 -The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him - cited by Denny, E., (1912)Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), ppp. 60–61 John CassianOn the Incarnation of the Lord, Against Nestorius Book III. Chapter XIV \\"How the confession of the blessed Peter is the faith of the whole Church.\\" The Orthodox Christian position is that all members of the church are called to be 'rock'; just as the church is built on the foundation of all the Apostles (), all are called to be stones (). Protestant Matthew Henry's bible commentary notes this too when he states Peter described himself as a fellow elder , placing himself on equal footing with the other disciples.Schaeffer, F., (1994)Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion (Holy Cross Orthodox Press; Brookline, MA), p179. Peter as \\"Prince of the Apostles\\" Peter is often called the Prince of the Apostles. If such a special title meant that he held a special charism it was not exclusively Rome's. Other Sees had been founded by Peter. Pope Gregory the Great recognised these Sees were all equally as Sees of Peter. There is no difference between the Sees of Peter.Braaten, C. E.(2001) Church unity and the papal office: an ecumenical dialogue on John Paul II's Encyclical Ut Unum Sint, (Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co; Grand Rapids, MI) p48. :Pope Gregory Theodoret also refers to other Sees being thrones of Peter.\\"Dioscorus, however, refuses to abide by these decisions; he is turning the See of the blessed Mark upside down; and these things he does though he perfectly well knows that the Antiochene (of Antioch) metropolis possesses the throne of the great Peter, who was teacher of the blessed Mark, and first and coryphæus (head of the choir) of the chorus of the apostles.\\" Theodoret - Letter LXXXVI - To Flavianus, Bishop of Constantinople. Peter as the Archetype As all are called to be rock, and as many Sees are of Peter, Peter serves as an archetype of Apostle. When he receives the keys he represents all of the Apostles.Abbé Guettée (1866).The Papacy: Its Historic Origin and Primitive Relations with the Eastern Churches, (Minos Publishing; NY), p. 176 Morrison, J. H., (1872) Disquisitions and notes on the Gospels, (American Unitarian Association; Boston), p291. This is found in the writings of AugustineThou art Peter.\\" For before he was called Simon. Now this name of Peter was given him by the Lord, and that in a figure, that he should signify the Church. For seeing that Christ is the rock (Petra), Peter is the Christian people. For the rock (Petra) is the original name. Therefore Peter is so called from the rock; not the rock from Peter; as Christ is not called Christ from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. \\"Therefore\\", he saith, \\"Thou art Peter; and upon this Rock\\" which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledged, saying, \\"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, will I build My Church;\\" that is upon Myself, the Son of the living God, \\"will I build My Church.\\" I will build thee upon Myself, not Myself upon thee. 2\\\\. For men who wished to be built upon men, said, \\"I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas,\\" who is Peter. But others who did not wish to be built upon Peter, but upon the Rock, said, \\"But I am of Christ.\\" And when the Apostle Paul ascertained that he was chosen, and Christ despised, he said, \\"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\\" And, as not in the name of Paul, so neither in the name of Peter; but in the name of Christ: that Peter might be built upon the Rock, not the Rock upon Peter ... He was able to do what the Lord was doing, not in himself, but in the Lord. \\"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.\\" What no one can do in Paul, no one in Peter, no one in any other of the Apostles, this can he do in the Lord. Therefore well said Paul by a wholesome despising of himself, and commending of Him; \\"Was Paul crucified for you, or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\\" ... So then, ye are not in me, but together with me; not under me, but under Him. 6\\\\. Therefore Peter walked on the water by the bidding of the Lord, knowing that he could not have this power of himself ... 8\\\\. So Peter also said, \\"Bid me come unto Thee on the water.\\" I who dare this am but a man, but it is no man whom I beseech. Let the God-man bid, that man may be able to do what man cannot do. \\"Come,\\" said He. And He went down, and began to walk on the water; and Peter was able, because the Rock had bidden him. Augustine Homilies on the Gospels Sermon XXVI. [LXXVI. Ben.] Again on Matt. xiv. 25: Of the Lord walking on the waves of the sea, and of Peter tottering. and Cyprian.\\"Our Lord, whose precepts and admonitions we ought to observe, describing the honour of a bishop and the order of His Church, speaks in the Gospel, and says to Peter: \\"I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" Thence, through the changes of times and successions, the ordering of bishops and the plan of the Church flow onwards; so that the Church is founded upon the bishops, and every act of the Church is controlled. Since this, then, is founded on the divine law, I marvel that some, with daring temerity, have chosen to write to me as if they wrote in the name of the Church; when the Church is established in the bishop and the clergy, and all who stand fast in the faith - Cyprian Epistle XXVI Cyprian to the Lapsed. Gregory the Great The pope now holds the title of universal bishop. However such titles once raised the ire of popes.M'Gavin, Wm., (1823) The protestant: Volume II. No. II. A series of essays on the principal points of controversy between the Church of Rome and the Reformed, (6th ed.) (Waugh & Innes; Edinburgh), pp426-7. Pope Gregory the Great heard that Patriarch John the Faster had accepted the title ecumenical patriarch. This simply meant patriarch to the emperor, not 'universal' patriarch.Universal bishop The pope wrote to the emperor to protest that any one bishop should be accorded the title universal bishop. Gregory first accords Peter the title prince of the Apostles. Gregory notes that honor was bestowed upon Peter and the church in Rome – given it by an ecumenical council, but that no one person used the title.\\"Certainly, in honour of Peter, Prince of the apostles, it was offered by the venerable synod of Chalcedon to the Roman pontif. But none of them has ever consented to use this name of singularity, lest, by something being given peculiarly to one, priests in general should be deprived of the honour due to them. How is it then that we do not seek the glory of this title even when offered, and another presumes to seize it for himself though not offered? Ibid. It was an honor for all priests.\\"But far from Christian hearts be that name of blasphemy, in which the honour of all priests is taken away, while it is madly arrogated to himself by one. 'Ibid. Gregory emphatically says no one person should have such a title.\\"He, then, is rather to be bent by the mandate of our most pious Lords, who scorns to render obedience to canonical injunctions. He is to be coerced, who does wrong to the holy Universal Church, who swells in heart, who covets rejoicing in a name of singularity, who also puts himself above the dignity of your Empire through a title peculiar to himself. Behold, we all suffer offence for this thing. Let then the author of the offence be brought back to a right way of life; and all quarrels of priests will cease. For I for my part am the servant of all priests, so long as they live as becomes priests. For whosoever, through the swelling of vain glory, lifts up his neck against Almighty God and against the statutes of the Fathers, I trust in Almighty God that he will not bend my neck to himself, not even with swords.Ibid. Pelagianism During the controversies surrounding Pelagius' heresies a council in Mileve (in Numidia) found against Pelagianism. They then wrote to the pope seeking his help. They gave him much praise Catholic apologists may make the most of such praise. However in the context of history one must also note that this praise was conditional. The next pope Zosimus did not out-rightly condemn the heresy Pelagianism and was himself condemned by the rest of the church for back-pedalling.Hinson, E. G., (1995) The church triumphant: a history of Christianity up to 1300, (Mercer University Press; Macon, GA), p. 264 Thus the same church (in Africa) could lavish praise upon the church in Rome but could equally condemn them, depending on the teachings Rome upheld. Zosimus eventually reconfirmed the decision of Innocent, Pelagius went to the churches in Palestine where a synod was called to hear his case.Augustine On Original Sin - Chapter 15 [XIV.]—Pelagius by His Mendacity and Deception Stole His Acquittal from the Synod in Palestine Augustine says that the churches in Palestine were deceived by Pelagius. What is important though is that even after two popes had condemned him Pelagius could still seek judgment by another region's synod. Evidently the Palestinian churches did not see the condemnation of the church in Rome and the church in Africa as binding. It would take an ecumenical council to bring the churches to agreement on this matter. Cyprian In the encyclical Satis cognitum Pope Leo XIII misquotes Cyprian. The quotation is taken from Cyrpian's letter to Antonianus who was questioning whether he should be loyal to Cornelius or another claimant to the pontificate Novation. Cornelius selection as bishop of Rome was backed by sixteen bishops. Cyprian stated that Novation Therefore to adhere to a heretic (Novation) is to separate oneself from the Catholic Church. Furthermore Cyprian confirms here that the one church is divided into many bishoprics throughout the world. He goes on to say in the same letter Cyprian is used several times in Catholic apologetics.Ray, S. K., (1999) Upon this rock: St. Peter and the primacy of Rome in scripture and the early church, (Ignatius Press; San Francisco), pp296-7 The Jesuit scholar Bévnot notes… Cyprian and Augustine Background - Donatism :During the persecutions of the early church some Christians, in order to avoid persecution renounced their faith. A question then rose of how to accept these people back into the church. Some argued that they should just be allowed back into the church. Others, \\"Donatists\\" argued that re-baptism was required. Cyprian of Carthage was one who argued that the lapsed needed to be baptised again. Augustine would argue against rebaptism. Augustine’s position was one that was accepted as orthodox. The local church decides for itself :Cyprian stated the position that each local church to decide upon matters.\\"It remains, that upon this same matter each of us should bring forward what we think, judging no man, nor rejecting any one from the right of communion, if he should think differently from us. For neither does any of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops, nor by tyrannical terror does any compel his colleague to the necessity of obedience; since every bishop, according to the allowance of his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he himself can judge another. But let us all wait for the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only one that has the power both of preferring us in the government of His Church, and of judging us in our conduct there.\\" The Seventh Council of Carthage; The Synod held at Carthage over which presided the Great and Holy Martyr Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage. Cyprian was adamant that the popes had no power over him.\\"For neither did Peter, whom first the Lord chose, when Paul disputed with him afterwards about the circumcision, claim anything to himself insolently, nor arrogantly assume anything, so as to say that he held primacy, and that he ought to be obeyed to novices and those lately come.\\" Epistle LXX concerning the baptism of Heretics - quoted in Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MD), p.34 Cyprian in his dispute believed he was following the teachings of the Apostles. He appealed to what he believed was always taught and this was the faith as maintained by all the Apostles. He addressed Pope Stephen not as his master, but as his equal.Denny, E., (1912) Papalism: A Treatise on the Claims on the Papacy as set forth in the Encyclical Satis cognitum, (Rivingtons; London), p. 281 Augustine supports Cyprian :Thus Cyprian's stance does not evidence Papal Supremacy. The pope had condemned this position but one local church continued on with its own matters in the manner it decided. Importantly Augustine, who disagrees with Cyprian's stance on dogma does not condemn Cyprian's manner.\\"Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands of truth. If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, \\"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;\\" Augustine On Baptism, Against the Donatists Book II.2 Augustine agreed with Cyprian's right to decide within his local church ... As Michael Whelton observed \\"He does not condemn Cyprian for refusing to submit to the Bishop of Rome\\"Whelton, M., (1998) Two Paths: Papal Monarchy - Collegial Tradition, (Regina Orthodox Press; Salisbury, MA), p. 30 Despite the fact that the pope had condemned Cyprian’s position, a general council had not yet ruled on the matter. Augustine recognises this fact.\\"There are great proofs of this existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,-to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council, what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow bishops of the African churches, that every man who had been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the Church, be baptized anew.\\" Augustine On Baptism, Against the Donatists Book I.18.28 Augustine is of the belief that Cyprian might have changed his mind if a general (ecumenical) council had been called.\\"I do not doubt that if he had had the opportunity of discussing this question, which has been so long and so much disputed in the Church, with the pious and learned men to whom we owe it that subsequently that ancient custom was confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council, he would have shown, without hesitation, not only how learned he was in those things which he had grasped with all the security of truth, but also how ready he was to receive instruction in what he had failed to perceive.\\" Augustine On Baptism, Against the Donatists Book IV.5.8 He states that a council would have the ultimate say in removing all doubt.\\"For, in the next place, that I may not seem to rest on mere human arguments,—since there is so much obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the Church, before the schism of Donatus, it has caused men of great weight, and even our fathers, the bishops, whose hearts were full of charity, so to dispute and doubt among themselves, saving always the peace of the Church, that the several statutes of their Councils in their different districts long varied from each other, till at length the most wholesome opinion was established, to the removal of all doubts, by a plenary Council of the whole world.\\" Augustine On Baptism, Against the Donatists. Book I.7 Augustine had elsewhere argued that a council could over-rule a local church - even the church in Rome.\\"Well, let us suppose that those bishops who decided the case at Rome were not good judges; there still remained a plenary Council of the universal Church, in which these judges themselves might be put on their defence; so that, if they were convicted of mistake, their decisions might be reversed.\\" Augustine Letter 43 - To Glorius, Eleusius, the Two Felixes, Grammaticus, and All Others to Whom This May Be Acceptable, My Lords Most Beloved and Worthy of Praise, Augustine Sends Greeting. Chapter. VII.19 Adherence to the Bishop of Rome was not \\"necessary\\" for unity.Benson, E. W., (1897), Cyprian– His Life – Hist Times – His Work, (Macmillan & Co; NY), p. 196 This is the orthodox understanding – bishops can be in error, including the bishop of Rome. Individual churches could disagree with each other, and still remain Catholic short of a general council deciding; it could be called in which all churches gathered and proclaimed a unity of faith. The African Church was steadfast in its belief, despite any papal pronouncements. In 258 at the Council of Iconium, presided over by St. Firmilian of Neo-Caesarea, and attended by Fathers from Cappadocia, Lycea, Galatia and other parts of Asia. It rejected the teaching of Pope Stephen of Rome, and confirmed the decrees of Carthage in regards to the rebaptism and re-ordination of converts baptized or ordained by heretics. Around 419 at the Council of Carthage, presided over by Pope Aurelius of Carthage, and attended by 217 bishops all together it condemned Pelagianism (those who deny original sin and grace) and Donatism (who reject the ordination of those who had lapsed during the persecution), and denied the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome in the African Church. Further it enumerated canon of Holy Scriptures (Old and New Testaments), and prohibited the rebaptism or re-ordination of those baptized or ordained by Donatists. (which of course depends on whether they were rightly ordained/baptised in the first place). Eventually, following an Ecumenical Council the orthodox position as supported by both the pope and Augustine was accepted in Africa. But, as shown they did not accept it simply because the pope had stated it was so. They recognised he could be in error, and that they had, for the time being ruled on their own affairs themselves. Augustine supported Cyprian's right to decide as he did. St Vincent of Lérins As Augustine argues that Cyprian would have rejoined orthodox belief following a general council, Vincent of Lérins wrote on what he considered constituted the teachings of the Catholic Church. His opening \\"General Rule\\" mentions no adhesion to the Bishop of Rome, rather what is taught by all the church. Hasler sums this up as This same rule would be used also to argue against Papal infallibility. The Reunion Council For Orthodox, the acceptance of a council relies on two points, it must not only state the faith as always taught, but also be accepted by the whole church. A council can rule and still be rejected by the faithful. Some Catholic historians maintain that the Second Council of Lyon of 1272 shows the churches of the east submitting to Roman authority. It was at this council that the Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Michael endeavored to re-unite the churches (split apart at the Great Schism in 1054). The delegation who attended from the east however did not represent the churches in the east, but the Emperor himself. They were his personal emissaries.Papadakis, A., (1994) The Christian East and the Rise of the Papacy, (St Vladimir’s Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY), p. 222 Historian Steven Runciman notes; Michael had genuinely wished re-union. His primary fear was not an attack from the Turks, but the fear of a renewed effort by the Latin west against the Empire – one must remember that this is not long after Michael had recaptured Constantinople from the Latin west – which had held it since the Fourth Crusade in 1204. With the failure of this attempt at union through a political solution, Michaels fears were realised when the pope concluded an alliance with Charles of Anjou in 1281. The empire and the dynasty were saved from military intervention only by the Sicilian Vespers, (a rebellion that broke out in Palermo).Papadakis, A., (1997) Crisis in Byzantium: The Filioque Controversy and the Patriarchate of Gregory II of Cyprus (1283-1289), (St Vladimir’s Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY), p26. This council then, having been rejected by the whole church is not accepted in the east as a valid council, despite the pope accepting it as such. Conclusion of Orthodox rebuttal The Catholic position is that Rome's bishop stands out from the others because he has a special charism handed down from Peter. As shown above Rome's greatness was found in the two apostles Peter and Paul; that there was no difference between them. The Church Fathers state that the keys are held by others; John the Evangelist, for example, and the church as a whole. The Church Fathers also say that rock refers not just to Peter, but to the church, to Jesus, and to the Christian faith. Further there was no difference between one of Peter's Sees from another. Orthodox maintain that all bishops are equal. All are called to be rock. As a reflection of the Trinity the church is united by love, not a formal adherence to one particular bishop in one particular location. For Orthodox, each individual to truly be a person must also be engaged in this unity of love with other persons.Fitzgerald, K. K., (2006)Persons in Communion – A Theology of Authentic Relationships, (InterOrthodox Press; Berkeley, CA), p58. The Trinity too is joined by a union of love - with each member of the Trinity fully God. Each church is fully catholic united by love. To change the structure of the church would change how we perceive God, and also how we must interact with each other. Citations  Sources  * Abbé Guettée (1866).

It provides mobile connectivity for on-demand traffic information services and internet provided maps displayed inside select Nissan vehicles. The service began in December 1997, having been installed in the 1997 Nissan Cedric, Nissan Gloria, Nissan President, Nissan Cima and the Nissan Elgrand. The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the vehicles TCU (telematics control unit), unlike other Nissan vehicles that use the driver's cell phone to connect to their data services. Vehicles installed with the service Starting October 2006 * Presage * Skyline * Stagea * Sylphy * Teana * Wingroad * Murano * Serena * Lafesta * Note * Fuga * Tiida * Latio * Leaf * Elgrand Services Offered The services offered vary on the version of the navigation system installed in the vehicle.  Fastest route (on-demand VICS)  This feature offers the most efficient route based on various conditions between the point of departure and the destination. The objective of this feature is to offer a predetermined route that will enable the driver to arrive with the fewest interruptions, taking into account any factors that could contribute to a delay in arriving in the least amount of driving time. The VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication System) feature is a service offered only in Japan that provides traffic information and is broadcast digitally on FM radio frequencies. Operator Services By selecting this feature, the system will connect you to a call center, where a destination can be sent to your vehicle by an operator, which can be done while the vehicle is moving. Other information available includes current weather information, a search for restaurants as well as other features. If the caller is unsure of some of the details needed, the live operator can make suggestions or offer assistance in numerous categories.  AutoDJ (information content)  Some of the services available include traffic and weather information, horoscopes, including sports scores and game status. The information is then displayed on the screen. The downloaded text, and navigation can be read audibly by the navigation system. Starting September 20, 2006, CARWINGS was made available to subscribers on their home computers, by registering the URL of a site that offers RSS, which is then relayed to a separate \\"information channel\\" that is also displayed. Probe traffic information delivery Installed in conjunction with HDD navigation, this service began in November 2006. The telemetry is uploaded via mobile phones, and the Nissan Vehicle Information Center collects and analyzes statistical system to deliver results as traffic information. The vehicles position is then complemented by the VICS service to display the fastest route. The implementation is very similar to the \\"Floating car\\" system offered by Honda's Internavi service.

The album was recorded by Owsley Stanley in 1968, and released on 12 March 2012 through Columbia and Legacy, on the one-year anniversary of his death in an automobile accident. He had previously been supervising the development and release of this album right up to the time of his death on March 12, 2011. The album is dedicated to him, and set to the specifications Stanley set prior to his death. Background The concert by Big Brother and the Holding Company was performed at the Carousel Ballroom on June 23, 1968, shortly after recording sessions ended for the group's number-one hit album, Cheap Thrills. The concert took place during a brief six-month period in which the facilities were owned by bands including the Holding Company, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead. Afterwards, the ballroom would be purchased and run by Bill Graham, who renamed it the Fillmore West. Owsley Stanley, who most memorably produced innovative sound recordings for the Grateful Dead, manned the sound system for the Holding Company and other acts who played the Carousel. This is the first of Stanley's Bear's Sonic Journals, hundreds of released and unreleased live shows from the San Francisco psychedelic rock era. No mixing or remastering was done for the release of the album, as Stanley's intent was to create a unique and real sound. Recording Limited by the technology of 1968, Stanley admirably worked to perfect the sound produced by Big Brother during the performance. Unusual by today's standards, drums and vocals are transmitted on the left channel and lead guitar and bass on the right. The distinctive results are a raw sound depicting each instrument as a different individual entity. Stage monitors had yet to be developed, so the musicians had to listen to the echo effect in the ballroom, the P.A., and amplifier sound to cue pitch. An occasional missed note, especially in the vocal harmonies, was the result. Still, the miscues don't hinder the production of an overall classic performance by the Holding Company. Despite its imperfections, this style of recording features a distinct uncut sound that captures the true live experience of the performance. Stanley also insisted that no applause be dubbed into the recording. Performance As for the Holding Company's performance, Janis Joplin's lead vocals are dominant. Sam Andrew also ventured beyond his lead guitar role as an occasional co-lead vocalist and backing vocalist. The Holding Company's heavily psychedelic instrumentals jell superbly with Joplin's commanding vocals, making standouts like \\"I Need a Man to Love\\" and \\"Ball and Chain\\" all the more stellar. Joplin establishes an emotional integrity in her performance. This concert is a prime example of the Holding Company at the climax of their live appearances in San Francisco. Apart from the band's usual repertoire are two rarities, \\"Jam - I'm Mad\\" and \\"It's A Deal,\\" that had not yet been released. There is minimal stage banter, but what little there is noteworthy. After the eighth track, \\"Call on Me,\\" it is announced to Hells Angels bikers Tiny and Tim that their motorcycles would be towed if they were not promptly moved out of the parking lot. Release and reception Live at the Carousel 1968 was released on March 12, 2012 to compact disc on the Columbia/Legacy label. Subsequent releases were included on vinyl and, another LP release included a bonus track, \\"Call On Me\\". This version of the song was performed from the Holding Company's concert in the same venue on June 22, 1968. San Francisco rock analyst Joel Selvin noted the live album as an influential piece in the overall \\"social/musical laboratory experiment akin to inmates running asylums, whose six-month run may well have corresponded with the height of the whole sixties Haight-Ashbury/San Francisco thing...\\". He goes on to state the recording is a pivotal part in Stanley's long and innovative sound engineering career. In the liner notes, Stanley advises listeners on how to listen for the best experience: increase the volume and place one speaker on each side of yourself. Stanley also states that \\"I believe that this will be hailed as a definitive Big Brother live album...\\". Liner note writer Jaan Uhelszki explains, \\"These 14 songs are a testament to what a force of nature Janis Joplin and the Big Brother and the Holding Company was during these two nights at the Carousel Ballroom\\". Stanley's widow also expressed how the album preserved the production values Stanley held so dear: \\"This is Bear's vision -- how he heard the band live, and how he wanted to transmit it to you...\\".

Biography Bock was born in Linz. After high school graduation, she applied for a job at the municipality of Vienna and could start working as an educator. From 1962 until 1969, she worked in a school in Vienna. Afterwards, she started working for the youth care center Zohmanngasse in the Viennese district Favoriten and in 1976, she was appointed as its director. In the early 1990s, the youth welfare office increasingly sent youth with migration backgrounds to Ute Bock's center, also because they had already been turned away by other schools. This is when Bock started being involved in activism and humanitarian help for asylum seekers. In 1999, during a raid on her centre, about 30 young Africans were arrested for drug trafficking under the controversial \\"Operation Spring\\". Ute Bock herself was charged with banditry and drug trafficking, too. This led to her being temporarily suspended from duty. Later the charges were dropped, though she was forbidden to accommodate other African asylum seekers in her center. She then organised private residential communities, which she self-funded and supervised. In 2000 she retired, but continued working on her project. 2002 she founded her own NGO Flüchtlingsprojekt Ute Bock (\\"refugee project Ute Bock\\"). Over 350 asylum seekers find accommodation in Ute Bock's organised apartments. Another 1,000 homeless asylum seekers have their mailing address at her NGO's address. She made legal advice available to her clients. The NGO relies on donations. In Vienna, the campaign Bock auf Bier was started, in which a small percentage of the price of a beer was given to Bock's housing projects for asylum seekers. Bock auf Bier is a slang expression for Wanting a beer, but Bock Beer stands for a specially strong beer In 2012, president Heinz Fischer awarded her the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria, Austria's highest national honorary award. In December 2013 she suffered from a stroke and was unable to be as active as she had been before, which led her NGO into financial difficulties. Several flats could not be paid anymore and some asylum seekers had to change accommodation. In order for donations to be revived, she started working again in 2014. In 2018, she died in Vienna, aged 75.  Movies  Two films have been made about Ute Bock: * The documentary Bock for President was released in 2019. It was shown for the first time as a preview in cooperation between Stadtkino and the Vienna International Film Festival during the 2009 student protests in Austria in the then occupied lecture hall of the University of Vienna. The official premiere took place as part of the Vienna International Film festival at the Künstlerhaus cinema on November 1, in the Austrian cinemas the film was shown on January 15, 2010. * In November 2010, the feature film Die verrückte Welt der Ute Bock (The crazy world of Ute Bock) was released. It was directed by Houchang Allahyari and starred Josef Hader, Karl Markovics, Viktor Gernot, Andreas Vitasek, Julia Stemberger, Dolores Schmidinger, Peter Kern and Alexander Pschill. The film depicts Bock's work as well as stories of people she meets, both refugees as well as police.  Awards  Bock won several awards for her social implication: *1999: Ute Bock Award for Moral Courage ZivilcourageSOS Mitmensch: Der Ute Bock Preis für Zivilcourage. *2000: UNHCR- Refugee-Award *2002: Bruno Kreisky Award *2003: Karl Renner Prize and Greinecker Seniorenpreis *2005: One of the five Austrian women, who were selected for the project Peace Women Across the Globe 2007 *2007: International Human Award1\\\\.

Sarr was born at Foundiougne. His father (Koly Samba Sarr) was a former Chief of Foundiougne, Gandoune, former head of the constituency of Ndiaye-Ndiaye and former Prime Minister of Diognick in Senegal. Although Sarr was a prominent politician like his father during the colonial era, he is best known as a historian and author especially after his famous work Histoire du Sine-Saloum which was officially published in 1949 and peer reviewed by historians.Sarr (introduction: Becker), pp 11-12Klein, 277 Politics In 1963, Sarr was President of the Regional Assembly of Sine-Saloum, (Kaolack, Senegal) (French: Président de l’Assemblée Régionale du Sine-Saloum), a position he occupied when the historian Martin A.

A document which took him several years of research. It detailed the ancient history of the Serer kingdoms of Sine and Saloum, their constituent villages, provinces and founders (including lower Saloum - modern day Gambia, a former colony of the Kingdom of Saloum); the Serer kings; Serer culture; the coronation process of the kings; the Guelowar maternal dynasty; the Serer paternal dynasties and the royal house; the wars (religious and economic) that affected the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum; etc.Alioune Sarr.

Centre d'études francophonesLéopold Sédar Senghor. P. Seghers, 1988. . P 98 An extract was published in 1948 in order to assess the value of the document. The future president of Senegal Léopold Sédar Senghor persuaded Sarr in 1948 to get the document published. Senghor liaised with the assistant professor of history at the Sorbonne (Professor Michel Devèze) to review the manuscript. Professor Devèze was very interested in it but concluded that the paper was \\"a good start\\" and needed some work. Alioune Sarr reworked the document and in 1949 it was published by Présence Africaine. Although the document was previously unpublished, some were familiar with it and were using it illegally without giving credit to the author.Sarr (introduction: Becker), pp 4-12 The original document itself did not cover all the periods and some sections were somewhat brief. The Serer paternal Lamanic period was not covered in detail neither was the maternal Wagadou period (princesses from the Ghana Empire who married into the Serer paternal aristocracy - predecessors of the Guelowar). Nonetheless, historians such as Becker, Martin, etc., agree that, the original data were very numerous, and their contribution to a global history of these ancient kingdoms are indisputable.Sarr (introduction: Becker), pp 7-11 During investigations in Kaolack about the history of its neighborhoods, the historian Charles Becker came upon the document with the assistance of Mamour Mbodj (who was then Chief of Tiofak). Becker contacted Sarr and an agreement was reached to type it up; add an introduction, bibliography and notes sections; publish it and attribute credit to the author. Numerous editions have been made to it including the 1963, 1986 and the 1983 edition by Becker.DeCorse, Christopher R. West Africa during the Atlantic slave trade: archaeological perspectives.
