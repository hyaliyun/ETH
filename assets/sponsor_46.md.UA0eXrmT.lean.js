It starred Richard Benjamin, Dyan Cannon, James Coburn, Joan Hackett, James Mason, Ian McShane, and Raquel Welch. The original music score was composed by Billy Goldenberg. The song \\"Friends\\", sung by Bette Midler, can be heard during the final scene of the film and the end credits. Plot On a one-week Mediterranean pleasure cruise aboard the yacht of movie producer Clinton Greene (Coburn), the guests include actress Alice Wood (Welch), her talent-manager husband Anthony (McShane), secretary turned talent agent Christine (Cannon), screenwriter Tom Parkman (Benjamin) and his wife, Lee (Hackett), and film director Philip Dexter (Mason). The trip is, in fact, a reunion; with the exception of Lee (who was \\"sick of Santa Barbara\\"), all were together at Clinton's home one year before, on the night a hit-and-run accident resulted in the death of Clinton's wife, gossip columnist Sheila Greene. (Yvonne Romain, a former Hammer horror actress, appeared as Sheila Greene in a cameo performance.) Once the cruise is under way, Clinton, a parlor game enthusiast, informs everyone that the week's entertainment will consist of \\"The Sheila Greene Memorial Gossip Game.\\" The six guests are each assigned an index card containing a secret (in Clinton's words, \\"a pretend piece of gossip\\") that must be kept hidden from the others. The object of the game is to discover everyone else's secret while protecting one's own. Each night the yacht anchors at a different Mediterranean port city, where one of the six secrets is disclosed to the entire group. The guests are given a clue, then sent ashore to find the proof of who among them holds the card bearing that night's secret. The game for that night ends when the actual holder of the subject secret discovers the proof. Anyone who has not yet solved the clue receives no points on Clinton's scoreboard for that round. Following the revelation of the first card, \\"YOU are a SHOPLIFTER\\", suspicion begins that each guest's card does not contain \\"pretend\\" gossip but in fact an actual, embarrassing secret about each guest. On the second day, Christine is nearly killed when someone (not revealed to the camera) turns the boat's propellers on while she is swimming near them. The second game session takes place in an abandoned, derelict abbey during a thunderstorm, where the second card is revealed to be \\"YOU are a HOMOSEXUAL.\\" When Clinton does not return from the second evening's installment of the game, the guests return ashore the following day and discover his corpse. Although the group initially assumes that Clinton perished when a stone column collapsed during the storm, Tom points out several clues that suggest otherwise. The blood where Clinton was struck came from a stone at the bottom of a pillar, not the top, meaning it could not have fallen on him from a great height. Furthermore, a piece of wood landed in his jacket from where he was sitting earlier in the evening, implying he died there and was moved underneath the column. Finally, there was a burnt cigarette butt at his feet, despite Clinton being a non-smoker. Tom surmises one of the six killed him where he sat, then dragged the body to one of the pillars and dropped a stone (mistakenly from the bottom of the column) on his head to make it seem like an accident. Next, Tom reveals that his card reads, \\"YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER\\". After getting everyone else to reveal their cards (the others are EX-CONVICT, INFORMANT and LITTLE CHILD MOLESTER), he confesses to having had an affair with Clinton, revealing himself to be the homosexual and suggesting that one of the secrets belongs to each of the others. It is implied that the hit-and-run killer murdered Clinton to conceal his or her guilt in Sheila's death. This begins a macabre game of musical chairs of sorts, with guests jousting over who lays claim to which dirty little secret. Eventually, it becomes clear that Christine was the McCarthy- era informant, Alice the shoplifter, Anthony the ex-convict, and Philip the child molester. Lee tearfully confesses to having killed Sheila while driving drunk the previous year, and having accidentally killed Clinton the previous night after he provoked her by blaming her for Sheila's death. She locks herself in her cabin, and Tom is unsuccessful in reaching her. Shortly thereafter, she is found dead with her wrists slit, and the case seems to be closed. On the final night of the cruise, the crew and most of the guests go to a party on the shore, but Philip, who brought no money, remains on the ship. Tom returns to find him thinking over loose ends of the earlier events. Philip experiments with stamping out cigarettes, speculating that it was Clinton who attempted to stamp out the cigarette but was unable to in the dark. This further implies that he only had one try at it; Philip posits that, while he looked down and tried to put it out, the killer murdered him. Lee could not have killed him in this way, and therefore Philip suspects that Lee had \\"killed\\" a dead body. He further speculates that someone else – presumably the actual killer – stayed there after Lee fled and rearranged the scene to implicate her instead. Finally, Philip realizes that the six clues (Shoplifter, Homosexual, Ex-convict, etc.) spell out \\"SHEILA\\", and that a picture taken the first day has each of them standing under a letter of Sheila's name that corresponds to their clue – except for the final \\"A\\", which breaks the pattern. (The use of the acronym also explains the redundant \\"LITTLE\\" in Philip's own clue; \\"CHILD MOLESTER\\" would have divulged Philip's secret guilt well enough, but the \\"L\\" from \\"LITTLE\\" was necessary for the photograph.) With this, it becomes clear what had actually happened: after Alice (with whom Tom had been having an affair) confessed to being a shoplifter to Tom on the first night, he realized the pattern and saw an opportunity. He changed out his own card – \\"YOU are an ALCOHOLIC\\", the missing A – for a more condemning one, \\"YOU are a HIT-AND-RUN KILLER\\", knowing both secrets applied to Lee. He arranged for Lee to see his card and think the game's purpose was to expose her for her role in Sheila's death. Then he murdered Clinton on the second night, planning to frame Lee for the deed – made much easier after (impersonating Clinton) he taunted Lee into attacking the corpse and thinking she had killed Clinton. Thus, all of his detective work that day had been based on a crime he himself had committed. After Lee's guilt was \\"established\\", he spiked her bottle of bourbon with sleeping pills and, after she drank it, carried her body into the bathtub and slit her wrists, making it seem like a suicide. Her estate, worth $5 million, therefore went to him and freed him to pursue other romantic interests. Philip is himself guilty of attempted murder, having attempted to kill Clinton with the boat's propellers to prevent his secret from coming out. After Philip deduces Tom's guilt, Tom attempts to strangle him, but their fight is broken up by the arrival of Christine with one of the ship's Italian crewmen. She had listened to Philip and Tom's conversation. Philip then blackmails Tom into financing a film with the money from Lee's estate, employing the various guests in roles related to it but keeping Tom on only in a very minor capacity. The film ends with an encroaching closeup of an ominously silent but enraged Tom. Cast * Richard Benjamin as Tom Parkman * Dyan Cannon as Christine * James Coburn as Clinton Greene * Joan Hackett as Lee Parkman * James Mason as Philip Dexter * Ian McShane as Anthony Wood * Raquel Welch as Alice Wood * Yvonne Romain as Sheila Production The movie was inspired by an irregular series of elaborate, real-life scavenger hunts Sondheim and Perkins arranged for their show business friends (including Lee Remick and George Segal) in Manhattan in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Herb Ross also took part in the treasure hunts with his wife, Norma. Ross said one of the clues was spelled out by icing on a cake which had been cut up into different pieces. The climax of one hunt was staged in the lobby of a seedy flophouse, where participants heard a skipping LP record endlessly repeating the first line of the Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer standard \\"One for My Baby\\" (\\"It's quarter to three ... It's quarter to three ...\\"). The winning team eventually recognized the clue — 2:45 — and immediately headed for room 245 of the hotel, where bottles of champagne awaited them. Sondheim later recalled: > The idea for the movie grew out of two murder games I devised some time ago. > One was for Phyllis Newman; the other for four couples just after I got out > of college. A murder game? No, nobody gets murdered. With the four couples, > I told each person to think of a way to kill one of the others over the > weekend we would be spending together in the country. Then we passed out > envelopes and inside one was an 'X'. That person was the only one who was to > carry out his plan; the others were to spend the time avoiding being > murdered. Herb Ross made the film for his own production company; it was distributed by Warner Bros. Ross: > If you have a group of people on a ship, the ship becomes a metaphor for > existence, you can't help it. It's not a symbol one strives for, but it does > happen. It's not a picture about film people, it's about people... I'll tell > you what this picture is about. It's about civilisation and barbarism. You > cannot make up for the absence of civilisation. Casting Stephen Sondheim said he and Perkins \\"thought of the secrets before the characters\\". The Dyan Cannon character was based on talent agent Sue Mengers. Herbert Ross originally offered the role to Mengers herself, but she turned it down, claiming too many of her clients were out of work. Instead she pitched her client, Dyan Cannon, for the part. Mengers stated, \\"But they came and took pictures of my office to see what a lady agent's office looks like ... It's filled with ferns and plants. They want to construct a set just like it over in Nice.\\" Cannon later said she had not wanted to do the film at first as she disliked the role, \\"[t]he script seemed too broad, everybody caricaturised, especially my part. I mean, Sue Mengers is wild, but not that wild. There seemed to be no humanity in the women's roles.\\" She said Mengers talked her into it as \\"it'll be a chance to show them you've got something more than your obvious assets.\\" Cannon said she gained 19 pounds to play the role and the part was \\"finally changed, deepened. I still had to bring a lot to it, and I think the result's unlike anything I've ever done.\\" James Mason played a washed-up film director, who was reportedly based on a composite of two real-life directors. \\"Steve and Tony insist they wrote the part for me\\", said Mason. \\"If they did, they did it for a ready-made image. If the passé director is played by someone who makes constant appearances on The Late, Late Show, it helps. Consequently I'm playing it as everybody's idea of James Mason.\\" Raquel Welch played a movie starlet and Ian McShane her manager- husband. Welch claimed the two were based on Ann-Margret and her husband, Roger Smith. Sondheim later said the part was actually based on Welch herself and her one time husband Patrick Curtis. Shooting The movie was shot in the south of France. In an interview for a fortieth-anniversary screening of the film, Cannon said that filming on an actual yacht proved to be too difficult, and so production was halted, stranding the cast on location: \\"So we had to wait in the south of France while they built a set at the Victorine Studios [in Nice] for us. We had to spend our days lying on the beach and going to lunch and shopping. It was a hard job!\\" The shoot was not easy; according to Cannon the first cameraman was fired and the yacht sank. This required reshooting early in the process. There were also complaints about Welch's behaviour. In turn, she announced she was suing Herbert Ross for assault and battery as a result of an incident in her dressing room. She claimed she had to flee to London during the shoot \\"to escape physical harm\\". However she then returned to Nice to shoot the film's final scenes, although she was provided with a bodyguard. Warner Bros later issued a statement supporting Ross and criticising Welch for her \\"public utterances\\". Mason told a newspaper at the time that Welch was \\"the most selfish, ill-mannered, inconsiderate actress that I've ever had the displeasure of working with\\". Joel Schumacher worked on the film as costume designer. Reception Perkins and Sondheim's script was novelized by Alexander Edwards. The critical reception for the film was mostly positive. The film currently holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews. In The New York Times Vincent Canby called the film \\"an old-fashioned murder mystery\\" that \\"makes murder, as well as life, more interesting.\\" Raquel Welch later said she was \\"good\\" in the film \\"but being good in a bad movie doesn't do anything for your career.\\" Other Sondheim-Perkins Collaborations The Chorus Girl Murder Case In 1975, Tony Perkins said he and Sondheim were working on another script, The Chorus Girl Murder Case. \\"It's a sort of stew based on all those Bob Hope wartime comedies, plus a little Lady of Burlesque and a little Orson Welles magic show, all cooked into a Last of Sheila-type plot\\", said Perkins. He later said other inspirations were They Got Me Covered, The Ipcress File and Cloak and Dagger. They had sold the synopsis in October 1974. At one point, Michael Bennett was to direct, with Tommy Tune to star. In November 1979, Sondheim said they had finished it. However, the film was never made. Crime and Variations In the 1980s, Perkins and Sondheim collaborated on another script, the seven part Crime and Variations for Motown Productions. In October 1984 they had submitted a treatment to Motown. It was a 75-page treatment set in the New York socialite world about a crime puzzle – another writer was to do up the script. It, also, was never made.

Born in London, England on 2 March 1826, James Thomas was educated at University College School between 1835 and 1839, then attended University College. In 1879 he became a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and was then articled to Evans and Sons. For two years he was superintendent of gun machinery for the arsenal at Trubia, Spain. He then spend several years as engineer to the Imperial Gas Company at Vauxhall. In 1852, Thomas emigrated to New South Wales, where he was appointed resident engineer for the dry dock at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney. He held the position until 1857, when he was appointed inspector of government railways for New South Wales. Later, he was put in charge of arrangements for the 1868 visit of the Duke of Edinburgh. He visited England from 1872 to 1873, and on return was appointed Assistant Engineer for Roads and Bridges. In 1875, Thomas emigrated to Western Australia to take up the positions of Director of Public Works, Government Engineer and Commissioner of Railways. In 1878 he was Commissioner for Western Australia for the Exposition Universelle in Paris. At some point thereafter he travelled to England for health reasons. In July 1883, the Western Australian Legislative Council amended its membership to include the Director of Public Works as an official nominee member. Accordingly, Thomas was appointed to the Legislative Council. He died at Perth on 16 July 1884 after collapsing in the Legislative Council chambers on 14 July.

It lived in the late Albian stage. It is one of the few ceratopsians known from this period. However, the fossils from this genus have been sparse: only jaw and tooth fragments have been found so far.  Description  Kulceratops was named by Lev Alexandrovich Nesov in 1995.L. A. Nessov, 1995, Dinozavri severnoi Yevrazii: Novye dannye o sostave kompleksov, ekologii i paleobiogeografii, Institute for Scientific Research on the Earth's Crust, St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg pp. 1-156 The type species is Kulceratops kulensis. Both the genus name and the specific name are derived from the Khodzhakul Formation, kul meaning \\"lake\\" in Uzbek. Its fossils were found in Uzbekistan, central Asia. The holotype, CCMGE No. 495/12457, was in 1914 discovered by geologist Andrei Dmitrievich Arkhangelsky. It consists of a left maxilla, of which the front end has been broken off.  Classification  Kulceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned face\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. As Kulceratops is the oldest known neoceratopian, Nesov assigned it to a special Archaeoceratopsidae. Later workers considered it a member of the Protoceratopidae or at least a basal member of Neoceratopia. Due to the paucity of the remains, it is considered a nomen dubium  Diet  Kulceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the early Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.

Their arrest took place in 1871, and 212 persons were tried together in 1873, in the city of Constantine. Most were sent over to prisons in metropolitan France - Oléron and Saint-Martin-de-Ré (on Île de Ré) - then, as these were due to be closed, to Quélern (near Brest). At the same time, 29 of them were kept in Oran; Antoine Chanzy, the Governor-General, attempted to have them removed from the public's eye by proposing they should be sent to the Marquesas Islands. They too were ultimately transported to Quélern, through Marseille. A third group was imprisoned together with former Communards in Thouars. Due to malfunctions in the communication between ministries, the distinction made between sentences to transportation (traditionally, to French Guiana) and deportation (to New Caledonia) was no longer made - all were sent to New Caledonia in the end. Their arrival on the island coincided with transports of Communards, who were to leave precious testimonies of the Kabyles' presence. However, the Kabyles were left behind when the Communards were granted an amnesty in 1879, and remained in exile despite campaigns to raise sympathy among the French public. An amnesty was awarded only in 1895, and they were not able to return to Algeria until after 1904. Some descendants of the deported still live in New Caledonia. One of them, Taïeb Aïfa, served as the mayor of Bourail from 1977 to 2001. In Nessadiou (FR), south of Bourail, there is a Cimetière des Arabes, or \\"Cemetery of the Arabs\\"; over time, the community began to identify as \\"Arabs\\" rather than with a Kabyle or local designation. One elderly Algerian-Caledonian traces this to an occasion when the Algerians arrived to perform labour during Ramadan dressed in white robes, whereupon the native Caledonians decided that they must be \\"Arabs\\".

Walberg, who to that point had been better known as an announcer, and was a production of Stone Stanley Entertainment. Free 4 All and Quicksilver, a fellow Stone-Stanley production, premiered on the same day as part of USA's afternoon lineup that consisted of reruns of game shows from years past. These were the first two games to air in first-run on the network since the 1990-91 season, when USA aired the final season of Bumper Stumpers and The New Chain Reaction. The two programs were in fact paired on the schedule, but Free 4 All failed after nineteen weeks while Quicksilver ran for sixteen months. Gameplay Free 4 All was a basic question-and-answer game played by two teams of three contestants. The reason it was called Free 4 All was that any of the six contestants could buzz in if they thought they knew a correct answer. Round 1 The first round followed a slight variation of the \\"toss-up/bonus\\" format common in scholastic quiz bowl team competition: If a contestant answered a toss-up question correctly, that contestant's team received the opportunity to answer a bonus question; however, unlike in most quiz bowl tournaments, # the team could choose the category of the bonus question from among four options, with that choice then being replaced; # the contestant who correctly answered the toss-up (rather than the captain as in usual practice) was charged with answering the bonus question; and # that contestant could not confer with his or her teammates about the bonus question. A contestant's incorrectly answering the toss-up question gave the other team a chance to answer it (\\"bounce back\\"). Each correct answer in Round One was worth 25 points; toss-up/bonus cycles continued until time expired for the round. Round 2: Category Round The trailing team or the team that won the coin-toss if round one ended in a tie was given their choice of four categories to begin the round. All questions in round two were worth 50 points, and were always toss-up questions. New categories replaced selected ones, and the choice went to the team with the last right answer. Round 3: Free 4 All Face-Off Round 3 was a speed round. Host Walberg read a series of rapid-fire questions from a specific category (e.g., \\"Bodies of Water\\" might be actual bodies of water, or people or places with water names) for a time limit of 90 seconds. Correct answers scored 75 points for the team, and the team with the most points at the end of the round won the game and a prize package. If there was a tie, the next question in the packet broke the tie in favor of the team that answered correctly. Free 4 All Bonus Round The bonus round gave the winning team the chance to win up to $1,000 cash and a grand prize. The team lined up in whatever order they wished, and was presented ten categories. The team had 60 seconds for the contestant at the front of the line to choose a category and answer a question. Each right answer won $100 for the team. Regardless of the answer, that category was taken out of play. After time ran out or all the categories were chosen, the bonus prize was revealed from behind one of the categories. If the team answered that question correctly, or if they answered all ten questions correctly before time expired, they all won the grand prize. Whether or not they won it, they divided any money won by the team.

Today, five distinct canal-construction efforts are recognized. The retronym First Welland Canal is applied to the original canal, constructed from 1824 to 1829 and 1831 to 1833. Pre-canal times The Great Lakes form an excellent navigation route into the interior of North America. Downstream from Niagara Falls, ships can reach the port city of Montreal without encountering major difficulties. Upstream, the lakes are navigable all the way to the western end of Lake Superior. Early on during the European settlement of North America, lack of other infrastructure made the Great Lakes the premier route to reach the interior of the continent, and later to ship materials and goods from the new frontiers. The elevations of the Great Lakes, demonstrating the massive elevation difference across the Niagara River. The Niagara Falls stood as a mighty barrier. To bypass it, a portage road between Queenston, Ontario and Chippawa was used, but the solution was far from optimal. The cargo had to be unloaded, carried 18 km up the Niagara Escarpment, then loaded onto different ships to continue on its way. The relatively narrow Niagara Peninsula, situated between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, was a natural match to the idea of bypassing the Falls. Indeed, the idea of a canal across the Peninsula was examined as early as 1799, when a group headed by Robert Hamilton, a Queenston merchant, unsuccessfully petitioned the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. Hamilton's plan called for a canal to be constructed between Fort Erie and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Queenston. In 1816, a young man called William Hamilton Merritt bought a rundown sawmill on the Twelve Mile Creek, and added a grist mill and a store. The Twelve flowed from its source south of the Escarpment to Lake Ontario, but its water levels varied considerably, creating difficulties for Merritt and his mills. In 1818, when the flow was especially low, Merritt pursued the idea of bringing water to his mills from the Welland River. On a bigger scale, the Erie Canal, dug from the Hudson River through northern New York, was about to reach Lake Erie. The impending completion meant the cargo from upper Great Lakes was about to head down the canal and Hudson River to New York City, bypassing its previous destination, Montreal. At the time, a considerable rivalry existed between Montreal and New York for cargo headed to Europe via ocean-going vessels. All of these factors contributed to the construction of the Welland Canal. Planning In 1818, William Hamilton Merritt borrowed an instrument called a water level from Samuel Beckett, a mill owner in St. Johns. Along with George Keefer, John DeCew, and a couple of other neighbours he set out to survey a potential route for a water canal. From the headwaters of the Twelve Mile Creek near present- day Allanburg, they planned a line three kilometers south to meet with the Welland River. A ridge was encountered along the way, and using the instrument, the surveyors calculated it to be 10 metres high. It was actually double that height; the reason for the error is not known. On July 4, 1818, Merritt organized a meeting in St. Catharines. The outcome was a petition sent to Upper Canada Legislature to provide for construction of a canal between the Twelve Mile Creek and Welland River. Unlike Merritt's original water-canal plan, the petition included plans for allowing boats to cross the Niagara Escarpment. In 1823, Hiram Tibbetts, an engineer, was employed to make a formal survey for the route. He suggested to dig a channel below the surface level of Welland River between present-day Port Robinson and Allanburg, and then follow the Twelve Mile Creek northwest to DeCew's Falls (where John DeCew owned a mill). There, it was suggested to descend the escarpment by an incline railway and continue along the creek to Port Dalhousie to reach Lake Ontario. On January 19, 1824, an act of the Legislature formed the Welland Canal Company, with a capitalization of $150,000 and Merritt as the financial agent. As part of his fundraising duties, he travelled extensively, including the United States and Great Britain. Later in 1824, a revised route was put forward for the canal. It travelled from Port Robinson to Allanburg like the previous one, but from there went north and descended the escarpment by a series of canal locks in present-day Merritton. The canal then followed a local creek before joining the Twelve Mile and continuing on to Port Dalhousie. (With this new route, John Decew, one of the original canal proponents would become an opponent, when he realised that the new route would not only bypass his property, but divert water from his mill.) Construction The Welland Canal as originally planned. The present-day canal is marked in pale grey On November 30, 1824, approximately 200 people gathered near Allanburg to witness the sod-turning for the construction. Soon, contracts for the work were let out, but the actual construction didn't start until July 1825. Wherever possible, natural waterways were used, but this was not possible for the construction of the canal between Port Robinson and Allanburg. In what was called the Deep Cut, a channel over three kilometres long was cut, sometimes as deep as 20 metres. No less than 750,000 cubic metres of earth was removed. Prior to the construction of the Welland Canal, the main settlements in the area were located along Lake Ontario and Niagara River, as the interior of the Niagara Peninsula remained hard to reach and rural areas, if that. As the construction progressed, however, shantytowns to house the labourers and their families were established along the way, giving birth to communities that later became Port Dalhousie, Merritton, Thorold, Allanburg and Port Robinson. As the Deep Cut progressed, plans were being made for an alternate route to Lake Erie. The original motivation behind the canal was to bring water to mills, and this was met by constructing a canal to the Welland River. However, as the plans evolved to include a ship route, they were accommodated by simply following the Welland River until it emptied into the Niagara River. This was suboptimal for a number of reasons, the main one being the strong current of Niagara and the proximity of the towering Niagara Falls that made the journey hard and uncomfortable. Due to this, a second route was planned to diverge from the canal at Port Robinson. It would follow the Welland River southwest, then branch off, following Forks Creek and a 20 kilometre channel cut through present-day Wainfleet and the Wainfleet Marsh to reach Grand River and Lake Erie. In September 1827, work on the Deep Cut was paused due to heavy rains. Many workers were transferred to construction of the canal in Wainfleet, and had made significant progress before Deep Cut work was resumed the following April. However, the rains continued. On November 9, 1828, just two weeks' worth of work before completion of the Deep Cut, the banks of the cut near Port Robinson collapsed into the excavated channel, killing an unknown number of workers below. More landslides followed, and it soon became evident that making a cut deep enough as to use the Welland River as the source of canal water would not be possible. An alternate, sufficiently high source of water was necessary. Feeder Canal The Welland Canal including the Feeder Canal. The present-day canal is marked in pale grey Since the construction of a channel towards Grand River was already underway at the time of the Deep Cut failure, a dam across the mouth of the Grand was proposed soon after, in December 1828. From there, a channel could be dug to feed this level to the Welland Canal proper. An aqueduct would be used to cross the Welland River. The dam was relocated eight kilometres inland by naval authorities, mindful of its safety in times not long after the War of 1812. The settlement by the dam later evolved into present-day Dunnville. From there, the Feeder went southeast to Stromness, before turning northeast in a straight cut across the Wainfleet Marsh. The location chosen for the aqueduct across Welland River was not Port Robinson. Although the Welland Canal and River first met in Port Robinson, it was decided to dig the canal essentially parallel to the river for a couple of kilometres upstream before crossing it. The aqueducts of three subsequent canals were later built in the same spot. Once again, many of the Deep Cut labourers were transferred to the Feeder cut. The digging was finished in the span of 177 days, which was a large achievement at the time. Lake Erie water was let into the Feeder and Welland Canals in November 1829. As with other locations in the peninsula, shantytowns sprung up along the Feeder Canal. These later developed into places like Dunnville, Wainfleet and Welland, among others. The Welland Canal was officially opened on November 30, 1829, exactly five years after the first turning of the sod. Two schooners, Annie and Jane from York, Upper Canada and R.H. Broughton from Youngstown, New York, left Port Dalhousie on Lake Ontario and arrived in Buffalo on the eastern end of Lake Erie two days later. Annie and Jane returned to Lake Ontario along the same route four days later. On to Lake Erie The complete First Welland Canal including the Feeder Canal and the extension to Port Colborne. The present-day canal is marked in pale grey As mentioned before, the route to Lake Erie afforded by the canal, following the Welland and Niagara Rivers, was difficult and slow. The Feeder connected directly to Lake Erie, but it was long, and, not intended as a ship canal, of insufficient capacity. Over the course of the canal's first full navigation season in 1830, it became evident that a more direct route was necessary. In March 1831, a location called Gravelly Bay (now Port Colborne) was chosen as the new Lake Erie terminus for the canal. It was one of the closest points on the Lake Erie shore, and also offered a natural harbour for the ships waiting to enter the canal. The new part of the canal was to run in a fairly straight line, except for a stretch where it followed a local ravine and a creek to minimise required excavation of hard rock in the area. The Welland Canal Company obtained a loan of 50,000 pounds from the Province of Upper Canada. Construction started soon after, but it was delayed by rain, difficulty in clearing land, and a cholera outbreak in 1832. Neither the Wainfleet Marsh nor the rock south of it were easy to dig in, but work was accelerated during mild weather of late 1832 and early 1833. On June 1, 1833, the schooner Matilda, headed for Cleveland from Oakville, became the first ship to travel through the new channel. Completion Overall, the combined Welland and Feeder Canals stretched between the two lakes, with 40 wooden locks. The minimum lock size was 33.5 m by 6.7 m (110 ft by 22 ft), with a minimum canal depth of 2.4 m (8 ft). Today, very little of the First Canal is evident. Much of the Feeder Canal, however is still present today in Wainfleet township. References * Lewis, William H.

He is best known as the bass guitarist, backing vocalist and founding member of power metal band Helloween.Interview with Helloween Bassist Markus Grosskopf by Luxi Lahtinen. metal-rules.com 18 July 2010. Retrieved 20 July 2011. Biography Grosskopf started playing bass at the age of 15 when he became friends with a drummer and a guitar player. They were looking for a bass player, so he bought his first bass and started jamming with covers of the Sex Pistols, Ramones, and the like. They covered songs from the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, Sid Vicious, XTC, The Stranglers, and others. Some time later, he decided to leave in hope of finding a heavier band with more live playing opportunities, then he met Kai Hansen and his band Second Hell, with whom he started playing. The band soon joined forces with former Powerfool guitarist Michael Weikath and adopted the name Helloween, with the original lineup being Kai Hansen (guitars/vocals), Michael Weikath (guitars), Grosskopf (bass) and Ingo Schwichtenberg (drums). Helloween Grosskopf writes some of the band's songs, which were initially mostly used as B-sides, but since Rabbit Don't Come Easy (which contained 3 songs credited to Markus), tracks written by him are regularly present on their albums. In 2011 Grosskopf with Helloween band performed in Greece. During that time, he along with Andi Deris and Uli Kusch had recorded Master of the Rings. In 2017 he and his fellow band mates Kai Hansen, Michael Kiske, Sascha Gerstner, Andi Deris, Michael Weikath and Dani Löble had participated in the 'Pumpkins United' Reunion Tour. Side projects Grosskopf's first side project was Shockmachine where he played both bass and rhythm guitars. They released their first album, Shockmachine, in 1998. He played bass on the first two albums of Edguy vocalist Tobias Sammet's project, Avantasia, issued in 2001 and 2002. He played on Uriah Heep members' arranged orchestral version of Salisbury released on video in 2001. He also worked with the band Kickhunter, which released in 2002 their first album Hearts and Bones on which Markus played the roles of bassist, guitarist and producer, then again on the Little Monsters album released in 2007. His most recent endeavour is his bassguitar-focused side-project, Markus Grosskopf's Bassinvaders. In 2015, Grosskopf performed with Judas Priest in Belgrade, Serbia, and following it, performed in countries such as Russia, Japan, Australia and the United States. In 2016 he performed with Gotthard.

He is known to use both his fingers and a pick, depending on the song. He regularly uses a pick for the more straightforward, simple bass lines, as in I Want Out or Just a Little Sign, and fingers for more lead-type playing, as on Eagle Fly Free or Halloween. His playing style expanded on one of Helloween's more recent albums Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy, where many more bass solos and lead parts are heard, like \\"Invisible Man\\", \\"Light the Universe\\" and even some slap bass on the first single \\"Mrs. God\\", as well as \\"Goin' Home\\" from Pink Bubbles Go Ape, where one can hear slap for the first time in Helloween's discography. Regarding new ideas for the songs, he was quoted saying to the Metal Insider: \\"Sometimes I shout them into my mobile phone wherever I am at whether it be on a toilet, backstage, or somewhere else.

The author was Georg Bauer, whose pen name was the Latinized Georgius Agricola (\\"Bauer\\" and \\"Agricola\\" being respectively the German and Latin words for \\"farmer\\"). The book remained the authoritative text on mining for 180 years after its publication. It was also an important chemistry text for the period and is significant in the history of chemistry. Mining was typically left to professionals, craftsmen and experts who were not eager to share their knowledge. Much experiential knowledge had been accumulated over the course of time. This knowledge was consecutively handed down orally within a small group of technicians and mining overseers. In the Middle Ages these people held the same leading role as the master builders of the great cathedrals, or perhaps also alchemists. It was a small, cosmopolitan elite within which existing knowledge was passed on and further developed but not shared with the outside world. Only a few writers from that time wrote anything about mining itself. Partly, that was because this knowledge was very difficult to access. Most writers also found it simply not worth the effort to write about it. Only in the Renaissance did this perception begin to change. With the improved transport and the invention of the printing press knowledge spread much more easily and faster than before. In 1500, the first printed book dedicated to mining engineering, called the Nutzlich Bergbuchleyn (The Useful Little Mining Book”) by Ulrich Rulein von Calw, was published. The most important works in this genre were, however, the twelve books of De Re Metallica by Georgius Agricola, published in 1556. Agricola had spent nine years in the Bohemian town of Joachimsthal, now in the Czech Republic. (Joachimsthal is famous for its silver mines and the origin of the word \\"Thaler\\" and, ultimately, \\"dollar.\\") After Joachimsthal, he spent the rest of his life in Chemnitz, a prominent mining town in Saxony. Both Joachimsthal and Chemnitz are in the Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains. The book was greatly influential, and for more than a century after it was published, De Re Metallica remained a standard treatise used throughout Europe. The German mining technology it portrayed was acknowledged as the most advanced at the time, and the metallic wealth produced in German mining districts was the envy of many other European nations. The book was reprinted in a number of Latin editions, as well as in German and Italian translations. Publication in Latin meant that it could be read by any educated European of the time. The numerous woodcuts and detailed descriptions of machinery made it a practical reference for those wishing to replicate the latest in mining technology.Eric H. Ash, Power, Knowledge, and Expertise in Elizabethan England (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004) 23. In 1912, the first English translation of De Re Metallica was privately published in London by subscription. The translators were Herbert Hoover, a mining engineer (and later President of the United States), and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals. Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms that were unknown to classical Latin. The most important translation—outside English—was the one published by the Deutsches Museum in Munich.Georg Agricola, Zwolf Bücher vom Berg- und Hüttenwesen, (Berlin 1928). Summary A water-powered mine hoist used for raising ore The book consists of a preface and twelve chapters, labelled books I to XII, without titles. It also has numerous woodcuts that provide annotated diagrams illustrating equipment and processes described in the text. Preface Agricola addresses the book to prominent German aristocrats, the most important of whom were Maurice, Elector of Saxony and his brother Augustus, who were his main patrons. He then describes the works of ancient and contemporary writers on mining and metallurgy, the chief ancient source being Pliny the Elder. Agricola describes several books contemporary to him, the chief being a booklet by Calbus of Freiberg in German. The works of alchemists are then described. Agricola does not reject the idea of alchemy, but notes that alchemical writings are obscure and that we do not read of any of the masters who became rich. He then describes fraudulent alchemists, who deserve the death penalty. Agricola completes his introduction by explaining that, since no other author has described the art of metals completely, he has written this work, setting forth his scheme for twelve books. Finally, he again directly addresses his audience of German princes, explaining the wealth that can be gained from this art. Book I: Arguments for and against this art This book consists of the arguments used against the art and Agricola's counter arguments. He explains that mining and prospecting are not just a matter of luck and hard work; there is specialized knowledge that must be learned. A miner should have knowledge of philosophy, medicine, astronomy, surveying, arithmetic, architecture, drawing and law, though few are masters of the whole craft and most are specialists. This section is full of classical references and shows Agricola's classical education to its fullest. The arguments range from philosophical objections to gold and silver as being intrinsically worthless, to the danger of mining to its workers and its destruction of the areas in which it is carried out. He argues that without metals, no other activity such as architecture or agriculture are possible. The dangers to miners are dismissed, noting that most deaths and injuries are caused by carelessness, and other occupations are hazardous too. Clearing forests for timber is advantageous as the land can be farmed. Mines tend to be in mountains and gloomy valleys with little economic value. The loss of food from the forests destroyed can be replaced by purchase from profits, and metals have been placed underground by God and man is right to extract and use them. Finally, Agricola argues that mining is an honorable and profitable occupation. Book II: The miner and a discourse on the finding of veins This book describes the miner and the finding of veins. Agricola assumes that his audience is the mine owner, or an investor in mines. He advises owners to live at the mine and to appoint good deputies. It is recommended to buy shares in mines that have not started to produce as well as existing mines to balance the risks. The next section of this book recommends areas where miners should search. These are generally mountains with wood available for fuel and a good supply of water. A navigable river can be used to bring fuel, but only gold or gemstones can be mined if no fuel is available. The roads must be good and the area healthy. Agricola describes searching streams for metals and gems that have been washed from the veins. He also suggests looking for exposed veins and also describes the effects of metals on the overlying vegetation. He recommends trenching to investigate veins beneath the surface. He then describes dowsing with a forked twig although he rejects the method himself. The passage is the first written description of how dowsing is done. Finally he comments on the practice of naming veins or shafts. Book III: Veins and stringers and seams in the rocks This book is a description of the various types of veins that can be found. There are 30 illustrations of different forms of these veins, forming the majority of Book III. Agricola also describes a compass to determine the direction of veins and mentions that some writers claim that veins lying in certain directions are richer, although he provides counter-examples. He also mentions the theory that the sun draws the metals in veins to the surface, although he himself doubts this. Finally he explains that gold is not generated in the beds of streams and rivers and east-west streams are not more productive than others inherently. Gold occurs in streams because it is torn from veins by the water. Book IV: Delimiting veins and the functions of mining officials This book describes how an official, the Bergmeister, is in charge of mining. He marks out the land into areas called meers when a vein is discovered. The rest of the book covers the laws of mining. There is a section on how the mine can be divided into shares. The roles of various other officials in regulating mines and taxing the production are stated. The shifts of the miners are fixed. The chief trades in the mine are listed and are regulated by both the Bergmeister and their foremen. Book V: The digging of ore and the surveyor's art This book covers underground mining and surveying. When a vein below ground is to be exploited a shaft is begun and a wooden shed with a windlass is placed above it. The tunnel dug at the bottom follows the vein and is just big enough for a man. The entire vein should be removed. Sometimes the tunnel eventually connects with a tunnel mouth in a hill side. Stringers and cross veins should be explored with cross tunnels or shafts when they occur. Agricola next describes that gold, silver, copper and mercury can be found as native metals, the others very rarely. Gold and silver ores are described in detail. Agricola then states that it is rarely worthwhile digging for other metals unless the ores are rich. Gems are found in some mines, but rarely have their own veins, lodestone is found in iron mines and emery in silver mines. Various minerals and colours of earths can be used to give indications of the presence of metal ores. The actual mineworking varies with the hardness of the rock, the softest is worked with a pick and requires shoring with wood, the hardest is usually broken with fire. Iron wedges, hammers and crowbars are used to break other rocks. Noxious gases and the ingress of water are described. Methods for lining tunnels and shafts with timber are described. The book concludes with a long treatise on surveying, showing the instruments required and techniques for determining the course of veins and tunnels. Surveyors allow veins to be followed, but also prevent mines removing ore from other claims and stop mine workings from breaking into other workings. Prospecting, a woodcut from the book Book VI: The miners' tools and machines Minecart shown in De Re Metallica (1556). The iron guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks. Railroads descended from minecarts. This book is extensively illustrated and describes the tools and machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts. Book VII: On the assaying of ore This book deals with assaying techniques. Various designs of furnaces are detailed. Then cupellation, crucibles, scorifiers and muffle furnaces are described. The correct method of preparation of the cupels is covered in detail with beech ashes being preferred. Various other additives and formulae are described, but Agricola does not judge between them. Triangular crucibles and scorifiers are made of fatty clay with a temper of ground-up crucibles or bricks. Agricola then describes in detail which substances should be added as fluxes as well as lead for smelting or assaying. The choice is made by which colour the ore burns out which gives an indication of the metals present. The lead should be silver-free or be assayed separately. The prepared ore is wrapped in paper, placed on a scorifier and then placed under a muffle covered in burning charcoal in the furnace. The cupel should be heated at the same time. The scorifier is removed and the metal transferred to the cupel. Alternatively the ore can be smelted in a triangular crucible, and then have lead mixed with it when it is added to the cupel. The cupel is placed in the furnace and copper is separated into the lead which forms lithage in the cupel leaving the noble metal. Gold and silver are parted using an aqua which is probably nitric acid. Agricola describes precautions for ensuring the amount of lead is correct and also describes the amalgamation of gold with mercury. Assay techniques for base metals such as tin are described as well as techniques for alloys such as silver tin. The use of a touchstone to assay gold and silver is discussed. Finally detailed arithmetical examples show the calculations needed to give the yield from the assay. Book VIII: Roasting, crushing and washing ore In this book Agricola provides a detailed account of beneficiation of different ores. He describes the processes involved in ore sorting, roasting and crushing. The use of water for washing ores is discussed in great detail, e.g. the use of launders and washing tables. Several different types of machinery for crushing ore and washing it are illustrated and different techniques for different metals and different regions are described. Smelting ore, a woodcut from the book Book IX: Methods of smelting ores This book describes smelting, which Agricola describes as perfecting the metal by fire. The design of furnaces is first explained. These are very similar for smelting different metals, constructed of brick or soft stone with a brick front and mechanically driven bellows at the rear. At the front is a pit called the fore-hearth to receive the metal. The furnace is charged with beneficiated ore and crushed charcoal and lit. In some gold and silver smelting a lot of slag is produced because of the relative poverty of the ore and the tap hole has to be opened at various times to remove different slag materials. When the furnace is ready, the forehearth is filled with molten lead into which the furnace is tapped. In other furnaces the smelting can be continuous, and lead is placed into the furnace if there is none in the ore. The slag is skimmed off the top of the metal as it is tapped. The lead containing the gold is separated by cupellation, the metal rich slags are re-smelted. Other smelting processes are similar, but lead is not added. Agricola also describes making crucible steel and distilling mercury and bismuth in this book. Book X: Separating silver from gold and lead from gold or silver Agricola describes parting silver from gold in this book by using acids. He also describes heating with antimony sulphide (stibium), which would give silver sulphide and a mixture of gold and antimony. The gold and silver can then be recovered with cupellation. Gold can also be parted using salts or using mercury. Large scale cupellation using a cupellation hearth is also covered in this book Book XI: Separating silver from copper This book describes separating silver from copper or iron. This is achieved by adding large amounts of lead at a temperature just above the melting point of lead. The lead will liquate out with the silver. This process will need to be repeated several times. The lead and silver can be separated by cupellation. Book XII: Manufacturing salt, soda, alum, vitriol, sulphur, bitumen, and glass This describes the preparation of what Agricola calls \\"juices\\": salt, soda, nitre, alum, vitriol, saltpetre, sulphur and bitumen. Finally glass making is covered. Agricola seems less secure about this process. He is not clear about making glass from the raw ingredients but clearer about remelting glass to make objects. Prof. Philippus Bechius (1521–1560), a friend of Agricola, translated De re metallica libri XII into German. It was published with the German title Vom Bergkwerck XII Bücher in 1557. The Hoovers describe the translation as \\"a wretched work, by one who knew nothing of the science,\\" but it, like the Latin original, saw further editions.Georgius Agricola, De re metallica, Hoover translation, pp. xvi-xvii. In 1563 Agricola's publisher, Froben and Bischoff (\\"Hieronimo Frobenio et Nicolao Episcopio\\") in Basel, published an Italian translation by Michelangelo Florio as well.Georgius Agricola, De re metallica, Hoover translation, p. 601. Publication history Although Agricola died in 1555, the publication was delayed until the completion of the extensive and detailed woodcuts one year after his death. In 1912, the first English translation of De Re Metallica was privately published in London by subscription. The translators were Herbert Hoover, a mining engineer (and later President of the United States), and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals, such as the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, the history of mining law in England, France, and the German states; safety in mines, including historical safety; and known minerals at the time that Agricola wrote De Re Metallica. This translation has been reprinted by Dover Books. Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms unknown to classical Latin.

Founded in 1957, the foundation is named after William \\"Pete\\" Snell, a popular sports car racer who died in 1956 of head injuries he received when the racing helmet he wore failed to protect his head. A group of friends, scientists, physicians, and others joined together to create a group that would promote research and education as well as test and develop standards to improve the effectiveness of helmets.  Standards  *B-95 Bicycle helmets *B-95C Children's bicycle helmets *E2001 Equestrian helmets *H2000 Harness racing helmets *L-98 Mopeds and Low Powered Vehicles *M2015 Motorcycle helmets *N-94 Undefined or general use helmets used in sports and industry *RS-98 Recreational Skiing & Snowboarding helmets *SA2005 Auto racing helmets *SA2015 — 2015 Helmet Standard For Use in Competitive Automotive Sports *K2005 Kart racing helmets (same as SA without the need for fire retardant fittings) *K2010 — 2010 Helmet Standard For Use in Kart Racing PDF files of current and past Snell standards are available on the Snell Web site. Tests To qualify for Snell certification, the helmet must pass a series of tests. The tests are determined depending on the application and the requirements of the standard. Safety Snell Standards significantly surpass those set by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), ASTM International (ASTM) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's 16 CFR Part 1203. Snell Standards are updated about every five years. These updates are based on new scientific research and improved, available manufacturing technologies. As such, and in addition to other factors such as typical use wear and tear, Snell recommends that helmets be replaced approximately every five years to ensure good safety. Controversy In 2005, Motorcyclist magazine wrote an in-depth article discussing helmet testing and safety. The article included criticism of Snell Memorial Foundation standards by prominent head injury and helmet design experts, including Dr. Harry Hurt, author of the Hurt Report, who described the Snell standards as \\"a little bit excessive,\\" and Dr. Jim Newman, former head of Snell Memorial Foundation, who characterized the then- current Snell Memorial Foundation standard as a \\"marketing gimmick.\\" The article reported that a softer absorption material would transfer less g-force to the head in the most common motorcycle accidents than the stiffer absorption material required in Snell-certified helmets. Snell Memorial Foundation released a technical critique and rebuttal to the article, available at their Web site, which asserts that there are no viable data to indicate that a softer liner or a softer shell could result in less severe head injuries. In September 2009, New York Times published a follow-up article which cited the 2005 Motorcyclist article; SMF rebutted it as well. Snell Memorial Foundation's 2010 standard for motorcycle helmets now conforms to one of the magazine's criticisms, that a larger head will also be a heavier head.

Career Calder first worked as a journalist in Dundee and Glasgow, where he became noted as a socialist and peace activist; as Science Editor of the News Chronicle, he wrote under the name of 'Ritchie Calder'. After moving to London before World War II, he accepted an appointment as the Director of Plans and Campaigns at the Political Warfare Executive branch of the Government, which was responsible for the allied war propaganda effort. He wrote propaganda posters and leaflets and speeches for allied leaders. He was a member of the 1941 Committee, a group of liberal politicians, writers and other people of influence in the United Kingdom. In 1941 he became popular with his book Carry on London, which described the effects of the German bombardment of London, Coventry and other cities in Great Britain. After the war Calder returned to his former activities as a writer and specialised in internationalism, the peace movement and in the public understanding of science. He worked also with the United Nations and was President of the National Peace Council and of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He also worked for the News Chronicle newspaper as Science Editor. Sir Lawrence Bragg's original announcement of the discovery of the structure of DNA was made at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 but went unreported by the UK press. He then gave a talk at Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the News Chronicle of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \\"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\\". Calder was an ardent peace activist and humanist. In 1955, Calder recorded and released an album on Folkways Records entitled, Science in Our Lives. In 1980 he was one of the signatories of A Secular Humanist Declaration, a statement of belief in democratic secular humanism, issued by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (\\"CODESH\\"), now the Council for Secular Humanism (\\"CSH\\"). He was also one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. He also taught International Relations at the University of Edinburgh, from 1961 to 1967. He was created a life peer as Baron Ritchie-Calder, of Balmashanner in the Royal Burgh of Forfar on 5 July 1966, and received the 1960 Kalinga prize.

Structure It passes transversely below the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle to the anterior margin of the trapezius, beneath which it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. It crosses in front of the phrenic nerve and the scalene muscles, and in front of or between the divisions of the brachial plexus, and is covered by the platysma and sternocleidomastoid muscles, and crossed by the omohyoid and trapezius. The transverse cervical artery originates from the thyrocervical trunk, it passes through the posterior triangle of the neck to the anterior border of the levator scapulae muscle, where it divides into deep and superficial branches. * Superficial branch ** Ascending branch ** Descending branch (also known as superficial cervical artery, which supplies the middle and lateral portions of the trapezius) * Deep branch (also called the dorsal scapular artery). Descending branch in older literature. Most often, however, this artery branches directly from the subclavian artery. Function Superficial branch Upon entering the trapezius muscle the superficial branch divides again into an ascending and descending branch. The ascending branch distributes branches to trapezius, and to the neighboring muscles and lymph glands in the neck, and anastomoses with the superficial branch of the descending branch of the occipital artery. The descending branch which is also called as superficial cervical artery, anastomoses with the deep and dorsal scapular artery which in turn links to the subscapular artery. This anastomosis is a ring circulation around the scapula where it continues to the suprascapular artery via the circumflex scapular artery.Moore And Agur. Essential Clinical Anatomy (2002) America: Lippincott Williams Publisher. 2nd Ed. Deep branch The dorsal scapular artery (or descending scapular artery) is a blood vessel which supplies the levator scapulae, rhomboids, and trapezius. It most frequently arises from the subclavian artery (the second or third part), but a quarter of the time it arises from the transverse cervical artery. In that case, the artery is also known as the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery, and the junction of those two is called cervicodorsal trunk. It passes beneath the levator scapulae to the superior angle of the scapula, and then descends under the rhomboid muscles along the vertebral border of the scapula as far as the inferior angle. It anastomoses with the suprascapular and circumflex scapular arteries.

The RSR started in 1986, when the B&O; sold off its Buffalo and Rochester branches. The trackage was purchased by Genesee & Wyoming Inc., and split into two railroads, the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad and the Rochester and Southern Railroad. The Rochester branch was scrapped from Silver Springs south to Machias, New York.Rochester & Southern Railroad, Inc.--Abandonment Exemption--in Wyoming, Allegany, and Cattaraugus Counties, NY, Docket No. AB-354 (Sub-No. 1X) (ICC served Jan. 8, 1992) The RSR interchanges with CSX twice in Rochester, at CP-373 on the Rochester Subdivision and at Genesee Junction on CSX's West Shore Subdivision, where the RSR also interchanges with the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad, another shortline. Until 2003, the RSR also interchanged with the Genesee and Wyoming Railroad, also owned by GWI, in Caledonia as well as with Norfolk Southern's Southern Tier Line in Silver Springs. Since 2003, the G&W; railroad ceased to be, and was made part of the Rochester and Southern. Trackage In Rochester, the RSR mainline splits into two lines just north of the Chili Avenue (NY-33A) grade crossing: the Belt Line, which runs north into the heart of the city; and the Lincoln Park line, which runs parallel to the CSX mainline until the Brown Street underpass, where it turns south and crosses King and Canal Streets. After crossing Canal St., the track leads to Morse Lumber, an online customer, as well as the former entrance to the Rochester Subway, which has since been fenced off. The RSR made deliveries of paper to Gannett Newspapers through the subway until 1996 when the printing operations were moved to Greece, a suburb of Rochester. The subway has not seen use since and likely never will again as the city of Rochester has plans in place to fill this section of the tunnel with dirt. Heading north up the belt line, the track snakes to the north, passing over the Falls Road Industrial Track, then to the east and back to the north, to parallel CSX's Charlotte Branch. Just after the Lexington Avenue underpass, a switch off the Belt Line leads down to another former connection with old subway trackage. However, unlike the connection off Canal St., this connection was built in 1976 after the city of Rochester filled in the old subway cut from Lexington Ave. to Brown St. to save on bridge maintenance. Further north, the RSR runs through the center of Kodak Park, crossing West Ridge Rd. (NY-104) before heading north to its terminus at Matthews and Fields Lumber, another online customer, on Stonewood Avenue. Heading south from the Chili Avenue grade crossing, the first notable area of trackage is the Brooks Avenue yard. Continuing south, the RSR interchanges with CSX at Genesee Junction, where there are three online customers served by the RSR.STB Decision: 3/31/1997 - FD_33375_0 12 miles farther down, the Rochester and Southern passes through P&L; Junction, its connection point with the GNWR. The line then continues south to Silver Springs, where the RSR interchanges with the Southern Tier Line in the heart of Silver Springs. Since the merger with G&W; RR, the RSR operates their track from Caledonia south to Retsof, New York. There, the old G&W; engine shops are still used for the GWI locomotive fleet. From Retsof, the RSR continues south via ex-DL&W;/EL track to Mount Morris (village), New York, where there is a new American Salt mine. From there, the line continues south to Dansville, NY, where two new companies occupy the former Foster-Wheeler plant: Bombardier Transportation and American Motive Power. A portion of the line from Mt Morris to Dansville is via the Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad - specifically this is from a connection in Groveland, NY between the DL&W; and the DMM south to Dansville.

The name changed to the Rochester and Pittsburg Railroad in 1881 and was absorbed into the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway in 1886. The line was purchased by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1932, which maintained ownership of the line as the Chessie System and CSX before the line between Rochester and Silver Springs was sold to GWI in 1985. Operations under the new railroad, the Rochester and Southern, began in 1986. The RSR main line to Silver Springs formerly continued along the B&RP;/B&O; lines through southern Wyoming and northern Allegany counties through Machias Junction and beyond Ashford Junction. The line between Silver Springs and Machias was abandoned and later removed in the early 1990s after sister line B&P; took over operation of the southern portion of the line.

While a student at Nebraska, he interned in the Nebraska Governor's Office and, later, served as a legislative page in the Nebraska Unicameral. He returned home to Gering after college, and, in 1994, he began serving as a member of the Gering City Council. Smith continues to live in Gering, Nebraska. Smith has also worked in the private sector. He has been a realtor as well as a marketing specialist for the housing industry. Nebraska Legislature Elections In 1998, Smith defeated incumbent State Legislator Joyce Hillman 55%–45%. In 2002, he won re-election to a second term unopposed. Since Nebraska voters passed Initiative Measure 415 in 2001, he was term-limited. Committee assignments He sat on the Natural Resources and Building Maintenance committees and was the vice chairperson of the Transportation and Telecommunications committee. Smith served as Vice Chair of the Military and Veterans’ Affairs Committee and as Chairman of the Four State Legislative Conference in 2001. U.S. House of Representatives Elections ;2006 Smith ran for the open seat in the 3rd district in the 2006 election. Three-term incumbent Tom Osborne gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful run for Governor of Nebraska. Smith won the Republican primary with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates. He faced Democrat Scott Kleeb, a ranch hand and Yale graduate, in the general election. Approximately one-third of the funding of his campaign came from members of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, limited government, school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the US Department of Agriculture. For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote. The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences. It covers nearly , two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska's 93 counties (one of which, Cherry County, is larger than the entire state of Connecticut). However, Kleeb raised more money than any other Democrat had raised in the district in decades. Overall, the race was the most expensive in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1963. As the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House campaign committees. President George W. Bush also made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe Republican seat. In the end, Smith won by 10 percentage points, taking 55 percent of the vote to Kleeb's 45 percent. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 16 years; in 1990, Republican Bill Barrett only defeated fellow Unicameral member Sandra Scofield by 4,400 votes. It was also only the third time a Democrat had come reasonably close to winning this district in its current configuration; besides Barrett's narrow win in 1990, Virginia D. Smith only won her first term by 737 votes in 1974. Besides Bush's visit two days before the election, Smith likely rode the coattails of Governor Dave Heineman, who won many of the counties in the district with 80 percent or more of the vote in his bid for a full term. ;2008 Smith won the primary with 87% of the vote. He won re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Jay Stoddard 77%–23%.Our Campaigns – NE – District 03 Race – November 4, 2008 ;2010 Smith won the primary with 88% of the vote.

They believe that monitoring police activity on the streets is a way to prevent police brutality. The stated goal of at least one Copwatch group is to engage in monitoring and videotaping police activity in the interest of holding the police accountable in the events involving assaults or police misconduct. Copwatch was first started in Berkeley, California, in 1990. Methods The main function of most Copwatch groups is monitoring police activity. \\"Copwatchers\\" go out on foot or driving patrols in their communities and record interactions between the police, suspects, and civilians. Copwatchers hope that monitoring police activity will provide a deterrent against police misconduct. Some groups also patrol at protests and demonstrations to ensure that police do not violate the rights of protesters. One Copwatch organization states that it has a policy of non-interference with the police, although this may not be true for all groups. In Phoenix, Arizona, copwatchers have increased efforts of \\"reverse surveillance\\" on the police in an effort to document racial profiling. They believe that Arizona Senate Bill 1070, a controversial law that allows police to question people they believe are illegal immigrants, will increase racial profiling by police. Copwatch groups also hold \\"Know Your Rights\\" forums to educate the public about their legal and human rights when interacting with the police, and some groups organize events to highlight problems of police abuse in their communities. Activities   Response to the killing of Kendra James  In 2003, Kendra James was fatally shot by Portland, Oregon Officer Scott McCollister as she attempted to drive away from a traffic stop with Officer McCollister attempting to pull her out of the vehicle. After the shooting Copwatch offered a reward for a photograph of McCollister. It then produced and distributed posters bearing McCollister's photo and the phrase \\"Getting away with murder\\". The editorial staff of Willamette Week opined that the poster was \\"inflamed rhetoric\\" which would harm \\"the relationship between the Portland police and the community it serves\\", and claimed that protest posters put up by the Rose City chapter of Copwatch were aimed at \\"inciting generalized anti-cop hysteria at the expense of informed criticism\\". A member of the Rose City Copwatch group, which seeks to \\"disrupt the polices ability to enforce race and class lines\\", says that the shooting \\"demonstrate[s] a culture of racism and brutality that's really sort of at the core of policing\\". A grand jury later found no criminal wrongdoing on McCollister's part.  William Cardenas video  November 3, 2006: Video showing an LAPD officer striking William Cardenas 6 times in the face as he struggles to prevent the officers from handcuffing him. On November 3, 2006, CopWatch LA posted a video showing the arrest of William Cardenas, whom police described as \\"a known gang member who had been wanted on a felony warrant for receiving stolen property\\". According to the arrest report, when officers tried to arrest Cardenas as he was drinking beer on the sidewalk with two others, he fled, but was caught and tripped by the officers, who then began to attempt to handcuff Cardenas as he fought with the officers to avoid being arrested. The video, in which Cardenas struggles to prevent the police from handcuffing him, shows an officer repeatedly punching him in the face while trying to force his hands together. The officers indicated that they were unable to subdue Cardenas with pepper spray, which seemed to have \\"little effect\\", and that some of the punches were delivered in response to Cardenas putting his hand on one officer's gun holster during the struggle. According to the arrest report, several witnesses confirmed that Cardenas threw punches at the officers, who were only able to handcuff him after two of his friends arrived and told him to stop fighting. The circulation of this video led to nationwide media coverage of Copwatch, and, although the LAPD had begun a use-of-force investigation the same day as the arrest, prompted an additional investigation into police conduct by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Superior Court commissioner had previously concluded that the use of force was reasonable because Cardenas was resisting arrest.  Awards  In 2013 Berkeley Copwatch was awarded the James Madison Freedom of Information Award by the Society of Professional Journalists, Northern California chapter, for \\"effective use of public records to block a Homeland Security grant for putting an armored military vehicle on the streets of Albany and Berkeley.\\"  Criticism  Joe Arpaio, the convicted former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, known for widespread police brutality among his deputies and corrections officers, said that his opponents' videotaping of police during traffic stops \\"create safety concerns for his deputies.\\" Tim Dees, former police officer and editor-in-chief of Officer.com, alleges that Copwatch selectively distributes video and photographic media to \\"spin\\" incidents against law enforcement.

It is positioned around 3° to the north and slightly west of the star Gamma Comae Berenices and is visible in a small telescope. The galaxy was discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel on March 13, 1785. It was labelled as peculiar by Allan Sandage in 1961 because of the unusual structure in the center of the bar. NGC 4314 is a member of the Coma I group of galaxies. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SBa, which indicates a barred spiral galaxy (SB) with very tightly wound spiral arms (a). It is inclined at an angle of 21° to the line of sight from the Earth, and the primary bar is oriented with a position angle of 158°. The bar extends out to a diameter of before joining the spiral arms. These trail in 130° arcs out to a radius of from the nucleus. Outside the nuclear region, the galaxy is considered generally gas-poor, with no H II regions in the outer spiral arms. There is a prominent ring of star formation about the galactic nucleus with a radius of . 76 open clusters of stars has been found associated with this ring, and these are probably due, at least in part, to Lindblad resonance. Most of these clusters are 15 million years old or less. The current burst of galactic star formation is estimated to have lasted 30 million years. External to the ring, the stars are generally older than within the ring structure, suggesting a previous epoch of star formation.

An American force which had failed to recapture the vital outpost at Fort Mackinac in August 1814 attempted to starve its garrison into surrender by destroying the schooner Nancy which carried supplies to Mackinac from the Nottawasaga River and then blockading the island with two gunboats. A party of sailors of the Royal Navy and soldiers from the garrison of Mackinac captured both gunboats by surprise in the first week of September, leaving the British in control of the lake until the end of the war. Background The Old Northwest, as the modern American Midwest was known at the time, was inhabited by various Native American peoples who in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were resisting, with British support, efforts of American colonists to settle in the region.Gough (2002), pp.4–5 The British military outpost at St. Joseph Island was the most distant extent of British authority, and furthest from reinforcement from Lower Canada. The Montreal-based North West Company, which dominated the fur trade in the Great Lakes region, was active in supplying guns to the Native Americans in exchange for furs.Gough (2002), pp.5–6 Almost all the \\"Nor'Westers\\", as the locally-based Scottish and French-Canadian fur traders and employees of the North West Company were known, had Native American wives, so there were close connections between the company and the Native American peoples in the region.Gough (2002), p.7 American influence in the area was represented by a trading post and fort (Fort Mackinac) on nearby Mackinac Island. When the United States declared war on Britain in 1812, the North West Company put its ships and its voyageurs at the disposal of the British government.Gough (2002), pp.6–7 The Nor'Westers pressed the British to take Fort Mackinac and to move the British garrison on St. Joseph island to the Company's trading post at Sault Ste. Marie. Captain Charles Roberts, commanding the garrison at St. Joseph Island, hastily assembled a force of 47 soldiers from the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion, 3 artillerymen, 180 Nor'Westers who were mostly French-Canadian voyageurs and 400 Native Americans. Learning that the small American garrison (61 men) of Fort Mackinac were not aware that war had been declared, Roberts' force landed on Mackinac Island in the early hours of 17 July 1812 and forced the Americans to surrender without fighting.Hitsman (1999) pp.72–73 The news inspired large numbers of Natives to rally to the British and to Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief who was leading a confederacy of Native American tribes resisting the Americans in the Northwest. It also affected the morale of the American army under Brigadier General William Hull, who later surrendered at the Siege of Detroit. Although the Americans were aware of the importance of regaining control of the region, the British hold on the area was secure for the remainder of 1812 and for much of 1813 as their armed vessels controlled Lake Erie and repeatedly thwarted the efforts of the American Major General William Henry Harrison to regain Detroit. Having built their own naval flotilla on Lake Erie, on 10 September 1813 the Americans won the decisive naval Battle of Lake Erie. This allowed Harrison's army to recapture Detroit and win the Battle of Moraviantown, where Tecumseh was killed. By these victories, the Americans also cut the British supply line to Mackinac via Lake Erie and the Detroit River. It was too late in the year for the Americans to send ships and troops into Lake Huron to attack Mackinac. During the ensuing winter and spring, the British established another supply line from York to Mackinac, using a former fur trading route via the Toronto portage to Lake Simcoe and then to the Nottawasaga River. This was a shorter and easier route than the route from the Saint Lawrence River via the Ottawa River, Lake Nipissing and the French River to Lake Huron, that was still used by the Montreal-based fur traders. American Expedition of 1814 In 1814, the Americans mounted an expedition to recover Mackinac, which was part of a larger campaign to retake American territory granted by the Treaty of Paris and affirmed by the Jay Treaty. The American force initially consisted of five vessels (the brigs , and , and the gunboats and under Commodore Arthur Sinclair, with 700 soldiers (half of them regulars from the 17th, 19th and 24th U.S. Infantry, the other half volunteers from the Ohio Militia) embarked under Lieutenant Colonel George Croghan. The expedition sailed from Detroit and entered Lake Huron on 12 July. They first searched Matchedash Bay for the British supply base but, hampered by foggy weather and lacking pilots familiar with Georgian Bay, failed to find any British establishment.Elting (1995), p.278 They then attacked the British post at St. Joseph Island on 20 July but found that it had been abandoned. On 4 August, they attacked the main British position at Fort Mackinac but were repulsed with heavy losses at the Battle of Mackinac Island. Action at Nottawasaga In spite of their victory, the British at Mackinac were very short of provisions and would starve if they were not resupplied before Lake Huron froze at the start of winter. Sinclair had earlier captured a small schooner (Mink) belonging to the Canadian North West Company, and learned from one of the prisoners that the British supply base was at Nottawasaga Bay.Zaslow, p.148 Having sent Lawrence and Caledonia back to Detroit with the militia, he arrived at the Nottawasaga with Niagara, Scorpion and Tigress on 13 August. The British detachment at Nottawasaga consisted of a midshipman and 21 sailors of the Royal Navy under Lieutenant Miller Worsley, and 9 French Canadian voyageurs. The schooner HMS Nancy was present at the Nottawasaga, loaded with 300 barrels of provisions (salted pork, flour, spirits etc.) for the garrison at Mackinac. A few days before the Americans appeared, Lieutenant Robert Livingston of the Indian Department had arrived, carrying a warning from Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall, the commandant at Mackinac, of the American presence. Nancy was towed up the Nottawasaga River, and a crude blockhouse armed with two 24-pounder carronades removed from Nancy and a 6-pounder field gun was hastily constructed for her protection. Livingston had proceeded onwards to York to request reinforcements, but none were available. (Almost all the British regular troops in Upper Canada were already engaged in the Siege of Fort Erie, and the militia could not be persuaded to turn out.) On his return, Livingston was able to gather 23 Ojibwa to help Worsley's party. The Americans believed that Nancy was still en route to the Nottawasaga and intended to intercept the schooner on the lake, but on 14 August some of Croghan's troops landed to set up an encampment on the spit of land at the mouth of the river and foraging parties chanced on the schooner's hiding place. The next day, Croghan's troops (three companies of regular infantry) landed and attacked. The American vessels opened fire over intervening sand hills without success, but the Americans then landed a detachment of artillery with one (or two) 5.5-inch howitzers to support the infantry. Worsley decided that further defence was impossible and made preparations to destroy the blockhouse and schooner. A line of powder was set running to Nancy and from there to the blockhouse. At four o'clock, Nancy was set alight Gough, p.139 which in turn by way of the powder train, set off an explosion in the blockhouse. The blockhouse explosion surprised Sinclair, causing him to think that one of the howitzer's shots had found its mark. Worsley's party then retreated into the woods, having suffered one killed and one wounded.Zaslow, p.150 The Americans recovered the guns from the wrecked blockhouse and then felled trees across the river to block it. Sinclair departed for Detroit in Niagara, leaving the gunboats under Lieutenant Daniel Turner to maintain a blockade of the bay. Sinclair's orders were that the gunboats were to remain until they were driven from the Lake by bad weather in October, by which time it would be impossible for small boats to re-establish communications between the Nottawasaga and Mackinac. He did however authorize Tigress to cruise for a week or two around St. Joseph Island to intercept fur canoes. The gunboats' crews were reinforced by twenty-five men of the 17th U.S. Infantry, to serve as marines. Movements in late August The Americans had missed one hundred barrels of provisions in a storehouse, and two batteaux and Livingston's large canoe which had been moved higher up the Nottawasaga River toward the depot at Schoonertown. Worsley removed the obstructions from the river and sailed in open boats for Fort Mackinac with his sailors and Livingston, carrying seventy barrels, late on 18 August. Accounts of subsequent events vary; some state that Worsley evaded the gunboats, which were forced back into Lake Huron by a storm (which also nearly sank Niagara) a few days later,Zaslow, p.151 while others state that one or both gunboats had left the Nottawasaga almost as soon as Niagara was out of sight, hoping to capture boats and canoes involved in the fur trade with their valuable cargoes, and thus leaving the Nottawasaga unguarded. The Americans then heard that several boats manned by hired Canadian voyageurs under Captain J. M. Lamothe were attempting to reach Mackinac Island with supplies via the French River. To intercept this party, the gunboats cruised in a narrow channel about east of Mackinac Island, known as the Detour Passage. The voyageur party were warned and temporarily turned back up the French River.Zaslow, p.153 (Apparently, only three out of eleven boats ultimately reached Mackinac.) Having rowed and paddled , Worsley encountered the two gunboats in the Detour on 24 August but was able to turn aside without being spotted. He concealed the batteaux at a secluded bay and his whole party reached Mackinac Island in the canoe on 1 September. At one point, he had passed within only a few yards of one of the gunboats at night, without being detected. Capture of the gunboats Supplies at Mackinac had run so short that McDouall's soldiers were on half rations, and he had even killed some horses to feed the Native Americans.Elting, p.280 Worsley asked McDouall for reinforcements to be used to attack the gunboats. He was given four large boats and 60 men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, all of whom were accustomed to serving as marines. Lieutenants Bulger, Armstrong and Raderhurst of the Royal Newfoundland commanded three of the boats. Worsley commanded the other, which held 17 of his sailors. Bulger's boat was armed with a 3-pounder gun railing gun, removed earlier from Nancy and Worsley's with a 6-pounder gun, also from the Nancy. Two hundred Ojibwa from Manitoulin Island, led by Chief Assiginack, followed them in nineteen canoes in case any warriors were fighting for the Americans. Late on 2 September, the boats and canoes landed on Drummond Island. Worsley and Livingston went scouting the next day, and spotted Tigress anchored a few miles away. That night, the British and Ojibwa set out towards the gunboat. Except for Lieutenant Robert Dickson of the Indian Department and three chiefs, the Native Americans were told to wait away. In the early hours of 4 September, Worsley's four boats approached Tigress silently. The crew of the gunboat (thirty-one sailors and soldiers under Sailing Master Stephen Champlin) spotted them too late, and their fire missed. Before they could reload, Worsley's and Armstrong's boats were alongside the starboard side of the gunboat, and Bulger's and Raderhorst's boats were to port.Roosevelt, p.206 The Newfoundlanders and Worsley's sailors swarmed on board the gunboat and overpowered the Americans after a sharp struggle. Three Americans were killed and five wounded (including Champlin and both his junior officers). Three British were killed and seven, including Lieutenant Bulger, wounded. Livingston set off to find Scorpion, and returned two hours later to report that the gunboat was approaching. The captured Americans were hastily sent ashore. The next day, Scorpion came into view and anchored about away, but appeared not to have heard any of the fight. At dawn on 6 September, Worsley set sail towards Scorpion in Tigress, under American colours and with most of his men below decks or concealed under their greatcoats. The unsuspecting crew of Scorpion could be seen scrubbing the deck. Worsley approached to within few yards of the Scorpion and then fired a volley of muskets and Tigresss 24-pounder cannon. As the vessels came into contact, Worsley's men swarmed aboard the American vessel. The surprised Americans made little resistance. Two Americans were killed and two wounded. There were no British casualties.Zaslow, p.152 Scorpion (but not Tigress) had boarding nettings rigged and might have been able to fight off a boarding attempt from small boats, but not from a vessel of equal size. Aftermath The captured Scorpion and Tigress were renamed Confiance and Surprise. They sailed at once for the Nottawasaga. On hearing of the loss of Nancy, Lieutenant General Sir Gordon Drummond, the Governor General of Upper Canada, had urgently dispatched batteaux and extra supplies to the Nottawasaga. Confiance and Surprise returned to Mackinac at the start of October with sufficient provisions to keep the garrison of Mackinac supplied until the end of the war. The British planned to build a frigate and other vessels at Penetanguishene on Matchedash Bay in 1815, which would have further reinforced the British advantage in the area. The end of the war put a halt to most of this construction (although the armed schooner Tecumseth and the unarmed transport vessel Bee were built in 1816 and a naval base was opened at Penetanguishene in 1817). However, all British shipbuilding efforts on the lakes had to compete for resources against those on Lake Ontario, which were being surpassed by the Americans at Sackets Harbor. Another major problem was lack of additional land transportation for such purposes.Elting, p.311-312 At the end of the war, some British officers (including McDouall) and Canadians objected to handing back Prairie du Chien and especially Mackinac under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent. However, the Americans retained the captured post at Fort Malden, near Amherstburg, until the British complied with the treaty.Elting, p.323 Results Although small in scale, the British and Ojibwa Indian successes on Lake Huron were vital, given the remoteness and sparse population of the theatre. Some historians maintain that the expedition to recapture Mackinac Island was not merely a failure but also a waste of resources. The troops would have been better employed in the battles on the Niagara peninsula and the crews of the vessels more use in the squadron on Lake Ontario.Elting, p.273 On the other hand, 300 extra regular soldiers and the same number of sailors would have made little difference given the scale of the battles further east; and the successful recovery of Fort Mackinac would have spared other American troops tied down in garrisons in the west by hostile Native Americans.

It has overtaken Circle on Cavill as the second tallest building on the Gold Coast, behind Q1. The building was approved by the Gold Coast City Council in October 2004 and finished construction in 2012 along with the next stage of the Gold Coast renovation project. It was developed by Juniper Group, and constructed by Grocon at a cost of A$850 million. History The site was previously occupied by the Raptis Plaza. By early April 2010 construction of the core structure had reached level 40. By July 2010 the tower had reached half the structure's total height. On the 14 March 2011, workers left the site in protest at the sacking of 11 Australian tilers while Korean workers were allowed to stay. Owners of units from level 39 and below were able to move into their properties before the building was complete. Some shops had opened in the retail section in mid 2010. Design View from north east, 2015 The tower was designed by the local architectural company DBI Design PL.The design includes 288 units on 77 floors and 5,700 m² of retail space. An average square metre cost of A$16,490, made Soul the highest priced units on the Gold Coast at the time. Units Soul's penthouse, which spans four levels, was Australia's highest-selling apartment at A$16.75 million. Beneath the penthouse are three sub-penthouses each occupying a whole floor. Sales were strong between 2006 and 2008, however the 2007 global financial crisis curtailed purchases. All units in the building were sold for more than $1 million each. Buyers from China were specifically targeted after strong sales from Chinese visitors were recorded early in 2010. Overall most purchases were made from people living in the South East Queensland region. In early 2009 sales of units in Soul had slowed with just over 100 units still for sale. By July 2010, three-quarters of the units had been sold. Receivership The development was placed into receivership in October 2012. At the time at least 88 units in the building remained unsold. Earlier, Grocon had started legal proceedings against Juniper Group over alleged outstanding payments for construction. Management From November 2013, Mantra Group took over the management rights of Soul from the receivers & manager, PwC.

The name James Cavill has always been connected with Surfers Paradise. Dated back to 1923, Cavill paid £40 for a block of land. In 1925 he built the Surfers Paradise Hotel and is the namesake for Cavill Mall and Cavill Avenue. Then the bridge across the Nerang River was built, improving access to the hotel that, at the time, had a small zoo and a beer garden. During World War II, the hotel was used by convalescing soldiers, some of whom later returned with their wives and families.

He was the eldest son of Silla's unifier-king, Munmu and Queen Jaeui. Sinmun's reign may be characterized by his attempts to consolidate royal authority following unification and to reorganize and systematize the governing apparatus of the newly enlarged Silla state. Sinmun was named crown prince by Munmu in 665. He came to power in the immediate wake of Silla's unification of the peninsula following its defeats of rival Baekje and Goguryeo with military aid from Tang China, and then its check of Tang ambitions to establish its hegemony over the peninsula. It was in late summer 681, not long after coming to power (the official period of mourning was in fact still in effect for the recently deceased King Munmu), that a serious revolt broke out against royal authority. The so-called \\"Kim Heumdol 金欽突 Revolt\\", named after its leader, a high-ranking Silla official, though a serious challenge to royal authority on the part of a clique of aristocratic officials, also provided Sinmun with the motive to solidify his power through a purge of certain aristocrats. The causes of Kim's revolt are disputed. Kim Heumdol was the father-in-law of Sinmun, who had married his daughter. The failure of Sinmun to produce a male heir through her, and the subsequent erosion of Kim's favor and influence at court may have been a key factor. Other scholars see in it a more serious challenge on the part of military leaders (some of whom were also implicated), who following the successful conclusion of the wars of unification saw their own influence and status erode. Still others see the source of aristocratic grievance being the rising influence of non aristocratic officials, who were increasingly being used to staff government posts. In any case, the 681 revolt was soon put down and Kim Heumdol and those implicated were executed. Further evidence of Sinmun's ambitious attempts to buttress central authority lies in a 689 royal edict that eliminated the official salary system, called the nogeup 錄邑, or \\"stipend village\\", wherein in lieu of salary officials were allotted pieces of land and their attendant population whereby to extricate their income. In place of the nogeup Sinmun instituted a system wherein officials were allotted only \\"office land\\" (jikjeon 職田) from which they were allowed to procure only taxes on grain. This was clearly meant to sever the landed power base of aristocratic officialdom. In time, however, this royal initiative would prove no match against an aristocracy united in its determination to protect the sources of its power. Eventually (though not in Sinmun's reign) the old stipend village system would be revived. It was also in 689 that Sinmun made an ultimately abortive attempt to move the Silla capital from Gyeongju to Dalgubeol 達句伐, at what is now Daegu, evidence again that Sinmun was keen on extricating the base of royal power away from the aristocratic clans, and in so doing to empower it. The Samguk Sagi, the source of this attempt at capital shifting, provides no details as to why it failed, though it is safe to assume it encountered stiff resistance by capital aristocrats. It was following the attempted revolt Kim Heumdol that Sinmun rescinded the fiefdom granted earlier to Anseung, the would-be king of Goguryeo, and had him come live in the Silla capital of Gyeongju in 683. Perhaps related to this, the following year Sinmun was again faced with rebellion when the general and relation to Anseung was implicated in a revolt and executed. His followers then launched the rebellion without him, seizing what is now Iksan, location of Anseung's erstwhile fief. This revolt too was put down. Sinmun's reign also saw the expansion of the Silla government and reorganization of Silla territory. Several new departments were established and for the first time were organized a system of nine national provinces (an organization that had clear allusions to the nine provinces of China during the reign of King Yu 禹王, legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty). Established as well were a series of \\"secondary capitals\\" 小京, to which it was Sinmun's policy to relocate many of the peoples subjugated by the defeats of Baekje and Goguryeo. In 682 Sinmun also established the Gukhak, or National Academy, dedicated to training officials in the Confucian classics. He soon thereafter dispatched an embassy to Tang, now under the rule of Empress Wu, to request copies of the Book of Rites and other classics. Sinmun died in 692, having weathered several serious challenges to royal authority and set the framework for the organization and governance of the expanded Silla state. The aristocratic challenges to his authority, though defeated, were harbingers of the social unrest and political upheavals that would characterize later Silla.

It is one of Italy's major national card games, together with Scopa and Briscola. It is also popular in the regions that were once controlled by the Italian predecessor states, such as Albania, Montenegro, coastal Slovenia (Slovene Littoral) and coastal Croatia (Istria and Dalmatia). The Austrian game Trischettn as historically played in South Tyrol is also a derivative, albeit played with a 32-card German-suited deck. It is recorded only from the early 18th century, though greater antiquity is suggested by its lack of trump. The name of the game, literally \\"three seven,\\" may refer to seven sets of three or four point possibilities when a minimum of three each (three, two, ace or all of those together in a matching suit) are dealt, or to the fact that it is played up to twenty-one. According to Cäsar (1800), the name is derived from \\"Tre Sett\\" (three sevens) because, at that time, a player holding three sevens could declare them immediately and win the game (Partie). There are many variants depending on the region of Italy where the game is played.Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, pg. 311–312 – Oxford University Press 1996 Gameplay Tressette is played with a standard Italian 40-card deck and the cards are ranked as follows from highest to lowest: 3-2-Ace-King-Knight-Knave and then all the remaining cards in numerical order from 7 down to 4. The game may be played with four players playing in two partnerships, or in heads-up play. In either case, ten cards are dealt to each player. In one-on-one play, the remaining twenty cards are placed face down in front of both players. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible until a score of 21 is achieved. Players must follow suit unless that suit does not remain in their hand, and players must show the card they pick up off the card pile to their opponent. Scoring Points are scored by collecting the face cards (King, Knight, Knave), threes, and twos; each of these cards scores one third of a point. An ace scores one point on its own. Each player can only score an integer number of points; the thirds of point \\"in excess\\" go to the player who scored the last trick. There are 10⅔ points in a deck; with the point for the last trick that makes a total of 11⅔ points available. The match continues until a score of 21 is achieved. Strategy Basic strategy Basic strategy in tressette revolves around gathering as many Aces as possible because they are worth three times the value of any one face card. As such, players typically attempt to \\"strip\\" their opponent of the Three and Two in the suit in which they themselves hold an Ace; at that time, the ace may be played safely and a point scored in their favour. Hence, when holding several lower ranked cards in a suit plus the ace you may play the lower ranked cards in the hope your opponent is forced to play the three or two of the suit allowing you to play the ace. Obviously, holding Ace, Three and Two of a suit (called a \\"Napolitana\\", \\"Napoletana\\" or a \\"Napoli\\") is a particularly powerful holding as it allows you to play the Ace with impunity, careful not to surrender it to an off-suit card. As picking up the last hand garners a point, players try to organize their card play for this purpose near the end of a round. Partner interaction When playing in partnerships, any verbal communication between partners regarding the game is considered cheating, unlike in briscola (oral tradition has it that \\"tressette was invented by four mutes, briscola was invented by four liars\\"). There are, however, three conventional signs that can be exchanged between partners: Busso (\\"Knocking\\"): The player knocks or raps on the table. This sign can be used only by the first player of the trick. It instructs that player's partner to play the highest-ranked card of the suit being played, in an attempt to win the trick. If the partner does win the trick, he is supposed to play any card of the same suit. This strategy allows a player who has a strong card in a suit (i.e. a 2 or 3) to check whether his partner has the other one, without risking to play both cards on the same trick (thus squandering one high-rank card) and keeping the flow of the game under his control. Volo (\\"Flying\\"): The player lets the card drop or \\"fly down\\" from a few centimeters above the table. This sign signifies that the player has just played his last card of this particular suit. Striscio or Liscio (\\"Sliding\\"): The player slides the card across the table before playing it. This sign signifies that the player has many cards of that suit (where the exact implications of \\"many\\" depend on the context, e.g. the number of cards of that suit still in play or the number of cards each player still has). In some regional variants the use of this sign is deprecated and considered as illegitimate as speaking openly. Variations Napolitana Also called Tresette con l'accuso, it is one variation scored up to 31 is to use bonuses during game play. When you gather three Aces, three Twos, three Threes or any Napolitana (A same suit grouping of an Ace, Three and Two) and decide to play one of the group of cards, you declare that you have that grouping in your hand and score three points. A group of four (four threes, twos, aces) also scores three points. As well, the bonus may be repeated if having played one of the grouping, you happen to pick up a card that makes the grouping in your hand yet again. To keep track of all this, players traditionally turn one card in their collected cards face up, as it is done in scopa. Ciapanò Ciapanò (meaning \\"don't collect\\", or more literally \\"take not\\", in several northern Italian dialects), also known as traversone in Central Italy and as ko manje or chi fa meno (literally \\"who makes the fewest [points]\\") in Croatia and Montenegro, is a variation where the goal is to score the fewest points. The game ends when a player has 21 or more points, and the player with the fewest points wins. It is possible to do \\"cappotto\\", i.e. collecting all the 11 points, in which case the player scores 0 points and everybody else scores 11. Ciapanò can be played by more than two players: if the players are 4 or 5 each one plays on his own, and they receive 10 or 8 cards respectively. If the players are 2, the normal rules apply. If the players are 3, two players receive 13 cards and the one at the right of the dealer is dealt one more card. Before starting to play, he chooses one of his cards and passes it to the player at his right, who takes it and then passes one of his cards to the last player. The last player puts then one of his cards aside, to be taken by the player who wins the last trick. One of the regional variants to Ciapanò involves a special score for one of the cards (usually the ace of clubs) of eleven points, that is more than all the other scoring cards combined. The game ends when a player reaches 101 points, and the other rules are unchanged. Trešeta Trešeta is a variant very popular on Croatian Adriatic coast, particularly in Dalmatia, as well as on the Coast of Montenegro, particularly in the Bay of Kotor. It is played using the standard Italian 40-card deck. It can be played one-on-one but most commonly it is played by two pairs of players where partners are seated opposite of each other. The main difference from the Italian version is that it is usually played until a player or two partnered players reach 41 points, opposed to the 21 points usually required in Tressette. Also, the player that scores the last trick is rewarded with a full point and not ⅓ of a point. Otherwise, point value of card are identical to Italian version. The cards that score ⅓ point (Kings, Horses, Knights, Threes and Twos) are most commonly referred to as bele. Having three threes, twos or aces, or three highest ranked cards (Ace, Two, Three) of the same suit in hand is known as akuža. When player gets an akuža, three points are immediately added to their total score. However, akuža must be announced before the player has played their first card. The Croatian variant is played in a clockwise order, while in Montenegro the counter-clockwise order is used.

The movie was written by Larry Grusin, and also stars Catherine Hicks and Steven Hill. It also featured the final screen appearances of veteran actors Howard Da Silva and Hermione Gingold. Bancroft was nominated for a Golden Globe. The title is a reference of the first film in which Garbo is heard on screen. Her husky voice and purposefully exaggerated Swedish accent debuted in Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie (1930), which was publicized with the slogan \\"Garbo Talks\\". The film received negative reviews from critics and failed at the box office. Plot Estelle Rolfe's (Anne Bancroft) social activism and quick temper cause a lot of inconvenience for her grown son Gilbert (Ron Silver), who often must go to a New York City jail precinct to pay her bail. Gilbert is willing to go to great lengths for his mother, though, after a doctor's examination diagnoses a terminal brain tumor. Estelle's last wish is to meet the movie star she has idolized all her life, the reclusive Greta Garbo. Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher) sympathizes, but when husband Gilbert abandons his job to devote his days to the search for Garbo, she can't take it anymore and abandons him. An aspiring actress in Gilbert's office, Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), takes a liking to Gilbert and a romantic interest seems entirely possible, but first comes Gilbert's increasingly futile search for a famous woman who does not care to be found. Leads eventually take Gilbert to an elderly actress, Elizabeth, who once knew Garbo, and to an aging paparazzo, Angelo, who is somewhat acquainted with Garbo's habits and whereabouts, but neither is able to get Gilbert to her. Estelle's estranged husband, Walter, visits the hospital to say an emotional goodbye. With little time to spare, Gilbert is finally able to meet Garbo face-to-face and explain his mother's situation. Without a word, Garbo goes straight to Estelle's hospital room for a bedside chat, where Estelle herself ends up doing all of the talking. Gilbert is at peace with how his mother's life came to an end. As he strolls with Jane in the park, she and others are startled by the sight of Garbo walking by. Even more startling to Jane is when Garbo catches a glimpse of Gilbert and says hello.

The name shows the concept of the album as a novena, a Catholic devotion consisting of nine separate days of prayers, reflecting the album's nine tracks. The first track, \\"A Dim Entrance\\", depicts a character who is in the middle of a failing relationship and exhausted from trying to save it (Send me to bed, And I fall asleep / To an overwhelming sad). The remaining tracks are all introspective reflections into the relationship of the main character and his evaluation of the relationship. \\"The Competition\\" provides the listener with an overview of the relationship, from beginning to what will ultimately be the end. The final song, \\"A Golden Exit\\" describes the conversation between the main character and his estranged lover, ending the relationship and looking forward to a bright, new beginning for both people (Maybe we'll wake up with golden wings, Maybe we'll get wings / anything to set us free).

It arises from the thyrocervical trunk and passes upward, in front of the vertebral artery and longus colli muscle. It then turns medially behind the carotid sheath and its contents, and also behind the sympathetic trunk, the middle cervical ganglion resting upon the vessel. Reaching the lower border of the thyroid gland it divides into two branches, which supply the postero-inferior parts of the gland, and anastomose with the superior thyroid artery, and with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. Structure The branches of the inferior thyroid artery are the inferior laryngeal, the oesophageal, the tracheal, the ascending cervical and the pharyngeal arteries. The inferior laryngeal artery climbs the trachea to the back part of the larynx under cover of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It is accompanied by the recurrent nerve, and supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of this part, anastomosing with the branch from the opposite side, and with the superior laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery. The tracheal branches of the inferior thyroid artery are distributed on the trachea, and anastomose below with the bronchial arteries. The esophageal branches of the inferior thyroid artery supply the esophagus, and anastomose with the esophageal branches of the aorta. The ascending cervical artery is a small branch which arises from the inferior thyroid artery as it passes behind the carotid sheath; it runs up on the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae in the interval between the anterior scalene muscle and the longus capitis. The ascending cervical artery gives twigs to the neck muscles and these anastomose with branches of the vertebral arteries. One or two spinal branches are sent into the spinal canal, through the intervertebral foramina to be distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes, and to the bodies of the vertebrae. It then anastomoses with the ascending pharyngeal and occipital arteries. The pharyngeal branches of the inferior thyroid artery supply the pharynx. The glandular branches of the inferior thyroid artery are small branches which directly supply the thyroid gland. Clinical significance The relationship between the recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior thyroid artery is highly variable. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes upward generally behind, but occasionally in front of, the inferior thyroid artery. This makes it vulnerable to injury during surgery that involves ligating the inferior thyroid artery, such as excision of the lower pole of the thyroid gland. Also as the parathyroid is mainly supplied by inferior thyroid artery accidental ligation during thyroidectomy can cause hypoparathyroidism. The injection of dye into the inferior thyroid artery can be used as an alternate method in identification the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

It is located south of the city of Vancouver and north and west of Lulu Island. Sea Island is the home to Vancouver International Airport (YVR), a nature conservation area, and a permanent resident population of approximately 736 living in the neighbourhood of Burkeville. A small part of the island is under the administration of the Musqueam Indian Band. History The island was traditionally home to the Musqueam Indian Band, and they retain ownership over a tract of land on the island's north-west under the administrative title \\"Sea Island Indian Reserve #3\\". Construction of residential neighbourhoods on the island began during World War II. Under the authority of the Wartime Housing Authority, the Boeing Company built a 300 home subdivision to house its workers on Sea Island. This neighbourhood on the island's east side became known as Burkeville, and remains a residential neighbourhood to this day. A second neighbourhood, known as the Cora Brown subdivision, was constructed in 1946 on the north side of the island, originally with 50 houses. Although it grew to the point of requiring the construction of the island's second elementary school in 1962, airport expansion led to the community being disbanded in 1978. No trace of this neighbourhood remains. Vancouver International Airport Sea Island and Vancouver International, seen from above The airport first opened for service on Sea Island in 1931, and began servicing commercial flights in 1937. The airport received relatively light traffic for the next fifty years until extensive growth in international traffic, primarily between the United States and Asia, necessitated expansion of service. With investments from the airlines, the Canadian government and a surcharge on tickets for improvement costs, the airport began a significant overhaul in the 1990s. The airport is the second largest in Canada, with over 25 million passengers passing through each year. It has grown to three passenger terminals and three main runways servicing over fifty airlines. Ground transportation Grant McConachie Way is the primary east-west artery leading to the main airport terminal, while a significant amount of commuter traffic from Vancouver to Richmond crosses Sea Island north-south via Russ Baker Way. Sea Island is connected to Vancouver to the north via the Arthur Laing Bridge, and to Richmond via the No. 2 Road Bridge, Dinsmore Bridge, Moray Bridge and the Sea Island Bridge. Sea Island is also served by three stations on the Canada Line, part of the SkyTrain rapid transit network, which connects the airport to Downtown Vancouver and Downtown Richmond. Sea Island Conservation Area The Sea Island Conservation Area (SICA) is located adjacent to Vancouver International Airport (YVR) and consists of approximately 140.1 hectares (1.4 square kilometres) of land on the north side of Sea Island dedicated for conservation of wildlife and habitat. SICA was transferred to Environment Canada as a compensation package funded by Transport Canada to replace wildlife habitat lost as a result of runway expansion at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). The main goal for management of SICA is to maintain existing populations of wildlife that do not compromise aviation safety. Habitats on SICA consist of woodland, wetland sloughs, and old agricultural field habitat which support a diversity of birds, land mammals, and terrestrial plants. SICA habitat management discourages populations of flocking birds that may pose hazards to aviation safety, as well as discourages populations of beavers that can cause prevalent, severe and costly damage to habitat. Sturgeon Bank Wildlife Management Area Over 50 square kilometres in area, Sturgeon Bank is a marine preserve located off the west side of the island and is made up of intertidal and subtidal waters. Boating is prohibited in the area. Beaches and parks Sea Island boasts two public beaches, McDonald Beach Park and Iona Beach Regional Park. McDonald Beach is operated by the city of Richmond. It is a recreational facility, with a dogs off-leash area, picnic areas and boat docking available. Iona Beach is operated by the Greater Vancouver Regional District, with a focus on wildlife protection, beaches, information on the flora and fauna, as well as a walking trail that culminates in a 4 kilometer jetty out into the Sturgeon Bank. (See also: Iona Island, British Columbia.) Other services The island's south shore features a Canadian Coast Guard station, as well as floatplane docks, a business jet terminal and Vancouver Airport's South Terminal. Sea Island is also home to the Aerospace and Aviation Technology faculty of the British Columbia Institute of Technology as well as two hotels run by the Fairmont and Delta chains. There is a luxury designer outlet mall that opened in July 2015, as a joint venture between Vancouver International Airport and the McArthurGlen Group The Burkeville neighbourhood is served by the Sea Island School, built in 1891, serving grades Kindergarten to Grade Three, after which point students must commute to Lulu Island in Richmond.

He was a conservative Catholic, and a strong supporter of the pro-life movement. In 1966, he co-founded the Catholic magazine Triumph, which ceased publication in 1976. Biography Family His parents were Lois (née Robbins) and Leo B. Bozell, the co-founder of Bozell Worldwide. His wife was Patricia Lee Buckley, sister of William F. Buckley, and their 10 children include L. Brent Bozell III, also a conservative activist and the founder and president of Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group and publisher. Another son, Michael Bozell, is a Benedictine monk in Solesmes Abbey. The Bozell family grew to 23 grandchildren and a great-grandchild by the time he died. His godson was novelist Tristan Egolf. Early life Bozell was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and attended Creighton Preparatory School in Omaha. Bozell was the state American Legion Oratorical Contest Champion of Nebraska in 1943 and 1944, winning the national title in 1944. He served in the U.S. Merchant Marine in the Pacific during World War II. Bozell resolved to convert to Catholicism in 1946 but after his father's death that same year he deferred his decision until 1947 so as not to upset his family. Bozell (left) and William F. Buckley Jr. promote their book McCarthy and His Enemies, 1954 \\"A young, energetic red-haired Yalie from Omaha\\", as he is described in Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus, Bozell was the best friend and debating society teammate of William F. Buckley Jr. at Yale University, where he was President of the Yale Political Union and the campus World Federalist Movement. Political Activity Bozell was a consistent supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy, teaming up with fellow National Review associate William F. Buckley Jr. in 1954 to write a ringing defense of him in, McCarthy and His Enemies. Defending not only the man, but the phenomenon, he wrote, “McCarthyism … is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks.” He later joined McCarthy’s staff, shortly after Roy Cohn left, writing McCarthy’s defense speech before the committee seeking to censure him, as well as a series of policy speeches through at least 1956. In 1958, Bozell ran for the Maryland House of Delegates but lost. After this defeat he proposed the formation of a new political party at one of the editors' evening meetings in New York; the idea was summarily rejected by the more fusionist editors Buckley and James Burnham. He later worked as a speechwriter for Senator Barry Goldwater, for whom he ghostwrote the 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative. He was a founding member of Young Americans for Freedom. In 1960, he took his family to Spain for the first time, making him absent from the Palm Beach decision of Buckley, Goldwater, Russell Kirk, and William Baroody Sr. to freeze out the John Birch Society from the conservative movement. Kirk inferred that Bozell would not have had any reason to be opposed to the decision,http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/goldwater—the-john- birch-society—and-me-11248 but, in fact, he, along with Frank Meyer and William Rusher, protested the exclusion of the Society from the conservative movement. After the failed attempt to draft Goldwater at the 1960 Republican National Convention, Bozell, a strong proponent of a Goldwater candidacy, was disappointed and annoyed by the would-be candidate's firm endorsement of the moderate Richard Nixon–Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. ticket. In 1962, addressing an 18,500 strong conservative rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he issued a rhetorical order to the Berlin commander, \\"Tear down the Berlin Wall,\\" which would be echoed more famously 25 years later by Ronald Reagan, who exhorted Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"Tear down this wall!\\" In 1964, Bozell ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland against Charles Mathias, one of the leaders of the then-influential liberal wing of the Republican Party; references to the gnostic heresy and to the \\"arcana of Spanish legitimism\\" made during his campaign speeches may have contributed to his loss. Triumph In 1965, he moved his family to Spain purportedly because \\"you breathed the Catholic thing there\\" and, along with Frederick Wilhelmsen and William Marshner among others, founded the Catholic magazine Triumph in 1966 which Bozell intended to be a bulwark of Catholic orthodoxy and a sort of National Review for Catholics. The magazine featured contributions from distinguished names such as Russell Kirk (a Catholic convert), Christopher Dawson, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, John Lukacs, Thomas Molnar, Jeffrey Hart, Sir Arnold Lunn, Charles Journet, Rousas John Rushdoony (a Calvinist), and initially received an enthusiastic endorsement by Buckley in the pages of National Review. However, the relationship between Bozell and his brother-in- law had already begun to sour; in March 1966, when Buckley wrote a column warning that Catholics should not try to seek legislation that would impose on others their belief that abortion is murder, Bozell wrote a letter to the editors of National Review protesting that the column \\"reeks of relativism. ... Mr. Buckley writes in this instance as though he had never heard of the natural law.\\" Buckley was stung by the letter and had composed a bitter reply, but decided against sending it. In 1966, Bozell published The Warren Revolution, a scholarly critique of the Supreme Court of the United States under Chief Justice Earl Warren. Despite his relocation to Spain, Bozell remained conscious of US politics; he opposed the Richard Nixon administration, intoning in the pages of Triumph that by supporting Nixon's candidacy in 1968, the conservative movement had \\"ceased to be an important political force in America.\\" (Buckley would later change his mind and would agree with Bozell on this subject.) He later repudiated his support for the American experiment itself, as well as his own book The Warren Revolution. Buckley summarized Bozell's new position as follows: \\"[Bozell's] thesis now is that the republic of the Founding Fathers was doomed because of their failure to adequately enthrall the city of man to the City of God.\\" Bozell himself felt estranged from the United States in general and in particular the conservative movement in which he was once a rising star, denouncing conservatism as \\"an inadequate substitute for Christian politics.\\" Especially following the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, Bozell began to see the United States as a force of evil comparable in magnitude to the Soviet Union and denounced both democratic capitalism as well as Communism. Triumph idealized Francoist Spain, criticized the events leading up to the Vietnam War, including the US-backed assassination of the Catholic President of South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem, and the conduct of the conflict thereafter as irreconcilable with Just War Theory, declared against chemical warfare and nuclear deterrence (the latter Bozell had once been a strong proponent of), and identified its economic views with distributism. Friends of Bozell blamed his increasing devotion to Catholicism, his radicalism, and his dissolving relationship with Buckley (who was reportedly traumatized by the loss of his closest friend) on alleged mental deterioration; Neal Freeman had said \\"Brent simply started to fade and you could see it happening, but you couldn't do anything about it.\\" John Judis writes in William Buckley Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives: \\"The breakup of their relationship probably could not have occurred ten years prior or ten years hence. It was very much a product of the tumultuous sixties, which exhilarated Buckley and which lifted him to new heights of celebrity, but in which more troubled, less stable souls like Bozell capsized.\\" After founding Triumph, Bozell also founded the Society of the Christian Commonwealth whose educational arm, the Christian Commonwealth Institute headed by Warren Carroll, conducted annual classes, lectures, and seminars at the El Escorial in Spain. The entirety of the original faculty of and many of the donors to Christendom College had attended the program in Spain and were subscribers to Triumph. Carroll later remarked in his obituary for Bozell, \\"In a very fundamental sense, Christendom College was a Triumph enterprise.\\" Bozell was a staunch supporter of Pope Paul VI and strongly defended his condemnation of birth control in the encyclical Humanae Vitae but disagreed with the pope's decisions regarding the liturgy. He was a founding member of and served as a special ambassador for Catholics United for the Faith. Since its founding, Triumph teetered on the verge of collapse and Bozell was planning on shutting the magazine down until Patricia Bozell attended a forum at the Catholic University of America featuring radical feminist Ti-Grace Atkinson in March 1971. When Atkinson said the Virgin Mary was more \\"used\\" than if she had participated in a sexual conception, Patricia attempted to slap her and her hand hit the microphone and she was escorted out. When Bozell heard what his wife had done, he rose to his full height (he was a tall, Lincolnesque figure) and bellowed, \\"To Hell with Catholic University!\\" The positive reader feedback convinced him to keep the magazine alive. In 1976, after the death of Francisco Franco and the beginning of the Spanish transition to democracy, Triumph ceased publication. In 1985, Bozell founded Misión Guadalupe, a program devoted to the assistance and evangelization of Hispanic immigrants. Bozell faithfully visited the inmates of Washington's Lorton Correctional Complex in Northern Virginia every week for years until his death. Pro-life activity In June 1970, three years before the Roe v. Wade decision and when abortion was illegal in most of United States outside California, Washington, D.C., and New York, Brent and Patricia Bozell led the first \\"Operation Rescue\\" mission to try by direct action to negotiate with administrators at George Washington University Hospital Clinic in D.C., where abortion was permitted for the mental well- being of the mother. Bozell had asked clinic administrators to stop the abortions and, if they would not do so, to appoint a Catholic nurse to administer Baptism and prepare the remains for Catholic burial after each abortion. Bozell and about 230 others met at a local church for a \\"Funeral Mass for The Holy Innocents\\" celebrated by four priests. The rally afterwards included a Pro Life student group from the University of Dallas, Los Hijos de la Tormenta (\\"The Sons of Thunder\\"), who were dressed in khaki and red berets (red berets being worn by the Basques, whom Bozell admired), wore rosaries, and carried papal flags. One speaker declared: \\"America ... you are daggering to death your unborn of tomorrow. The very cleanliness of your sterilized murder gives off the stench of death.\\" After the rally, Bozell and seven others went to the clinic, where they were arrested after forcing their way inside. They received suspended sentences. Bozell said later, \\"If disorder is necessary to stop this murdering of babies, I'm in favor of disorder.\\" Buckley denounced Bozell's actions, declaring in National Review that \\"the Sons of Thunder have moved precious few of the unconvinced over to their side.\\" Though Triumph closed two years later, its staff and Bozell remained active, including the organization of the first March for Life. The cover of Triumph's January 1973 issue (after the Roe v. Wade decision) was solid black except for a small logo, a white cross, and the words \\"For the children\\". Illnesses and death Bozell suffered from bipolar disorder, writing publicly about his experiences, suffering, and recovery in the introduction to Mustard Seeds, a collection mostly of his post-National Review writings (including many from Triumph) published in 1986. The book included \\"Poland's Cross--And America's,\\" Bozell's first National Review essay in almost two decades. It also included the National Review essay, for which he may be remembered best, \\"Freedom or Virtue,\\" which touched off a robust debate between himself and Meyer, mostly around whether freedom or virtue should be the paramount consideration for American conservatives. Bozell died of pneumonia in a nursing home in Bethesda, Maryland, on April 15, 1997, at the age of 71 after years of numerous and crippling health problems. His son, L. Brent Bozell III, spoke of those struggles when eulogizing him: Works * (contributor) The Best of Triumph. Lawrence, E. Michael, ed.

Rough Crossing. New York: Samuel French, Inc., 1988. Set on board the SS Italian Castle, it follows world-renowned playwrights Sandor Turai and Alex Gal in their attempts to preserve, with the assistance of the unorthodox cabin steward Dvornichek, the relationship of their composer, Adam Adam, and his love, the leading lady Natasha Navratilova, despite the interference of lothario actor Ivor Fish. History It was adapted from The Play at the Castle (Hungarian: Játék a Kastélyban) a play by Hungarian dramatist Ferenc Molnár. Another English-language adaptation of this play was written in 1926 by P. G. Wodehouse, entitled The Play's the Thing.THEATER REVIEW; Exaggeration's the Thing, via Wodehouse - New York Times André Previn wrote three original songs for the play, \\"This Could Be the One\\", \\"Where Do We Go from Here?\\", and \\"You Never Heard it from Me\\". Synopsis In the 1930s, successful Hungarian playwrights Sandor Turai and Alex Gal, collaborators for twenty years, arrive aboard the luxury transatlantic liner SS Italian Castle, which is about to sail from Cherbourg to New York, where they are to present their latest musical comedy, The Cruise of the Dodo. They are accompanied by their young French composer, Adam Adam, a former actor who was forced to end his stage career after contracting a strange speech impediment brought on by the return of his terrifying mother from prison. The three intend to surprise their stars, the glamorous Eastern European actress Natasha Navratilova and the intellectually-challenged English actor Ivor Fish, with the newest song from the as yet unfinished play. Unfortunately, they accidentally hear Ivor declaring his love for the younger Natasha, his former lover, who appears to respond. This particularly affects Adam, who, although ten years her junior, is Natasha's current love. The rest of the play sees Turai, Natasha, and Ivor (who is married and terrified of his wife finding out), assisted by the cabin steward and jack-of-all-trades Dvornichek, attempting to convince the suicidal Adam that what he heard was in fact a rehearsal for a new ending written by Ivor. It is actually Turai, staying up all night, who has written this ending, integrating Ivor's and Natasha's words from the previous evening. He does not, however, inform Gal that he has done this, and the second act takes place at a rehearsal for the play, in which the new ending is presented, although it is interrupted by a bad storm and a lifeboat drill which everyone, Dvornichek included, takes to be a real shipwreck. During this, Adam throws himself overboard and is rescued by Dvornichek. Eventually, Adam is convinced that the whole thing was a rehearsal, reconciled with Natasha, who proposes to him, and cured of his speech impediment. The old play, which Turai realises is awful, is abandoned and replaced with a new play inspired by a script written by the (unseen) ship's captain and summarised by Dvornichek. Natasha and Adam are to star, Ivor is relegated to a silent supporting role, and the multi-talented Dvornichek takes over at the piano. Production history Rough Crossing opened at the Lyttelton Theatre in London on 30 October 1984 with the following cast: *Michael Kitchen as Dvornichek *John Standing as Turai *Andrew C. Wadsworth as Adam *Niall Buggy as Gal *Sheila Gish as Natasha *Robin Bailey as Ivor It was directed by Peter Wood and designed by Carl Toms. Rough Crossing made its New York debut with the Jean Cocteau Repertory Company in 1997, starring Craig Smith as Turai, Harris Berlinsky as Gal, Tim Deak as Adam, Elise Stone as Natasha, Charles Parnell as Ivor and Christopher Black as Dvornichek.CurtainUp Review of New York Debut Critical reception Alvin Klein of the New York Times gave a 1994 production of the show a favourable review, but noted \\"there's not all that much dazzle in Mr. Stoppard's razzle; the pizazz is in the production.\\" http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9E04E3D6173EF935A35752C1A962958260 CurtainUp reviewer Les Gutman calls the play \\"not terribly interesting\\", citing in particular a fundamental incompatibility between the source material's comedy and Stoppard's absurdist style.

At it is the third highest peak in the national park, behind Clingmans Dome (6,643 ft, 2,024 m) and Mount Guyot (6,621 ft, 2,018 m). It is also the highest peak that is completely within Tennessee. However, from its immediate base to its summit, Mount Le Conte is one of the highest peaks in the Appalachian Mountains rising 5,301 ft (1,616 m) from its base, near Gatlinburg, Tennessee (1,292 ft/394 m). There are four subpeaks above 6,000 ft on the mountain (referred to as the LeConte massif): West Point (6,344 ft/1,934 m), High Top (6,593 ft/2,010 m), Cliff Tops (6,555 ft/1,998 m), and Myrtle Point (6,200 ft/1,890 m). In addition, Balsam Point (5,840+ ft/1,780+ m) serves as the dramatic west end of the massif. Additionally, the mountain is notable for having the highest inn providing lodging for visitors in the Eastern United States. History There is considerable controversy over just which member of the Le Conte family the mountain was named for. The United States Geological Survey lists Joseph Le Conte, famous geologist, eugenicist, and advocate for racial segregation, as the man for whom the mountain was named, supposedly by Swiss explorer Arnold Guyot. However, in recent years this claim has been challenged by local authorities (including the authors of A Natural History of Mount Le Conte), who in turn believe that the mountain derives its name from Joseph's older — and less famous — brother John Le Conte, a physicist at South Carolina College. Their story alleges that the mountain was named by Samuel Buckley in respect to John's help in moving his barometer to Waynesville, North Carolina, at Buckley's request. Although the mountain was measured in the 1850s, very little activity took place on the mountain until the 1920s, when Paul Adams moved to Knoxville, Tennessee. An enthusiastic hiker and explorer, Adams spent much of his free time creating adventures in the mountains. In 1924 he joined the Great Smoky Mountain Conservation Association, a group dedicated to making the region into a national park. As part of this push, later that year he led an expedition up the mountain with dignitaries from Washington, in order to show the group what rugged beauty those mountains held.Manning (1991), p. 2 The group spent the night in a large tent which would later become a cabin, and eventually the LeConte Lodge, a popular resort near the top of the peak. The trip was a great success and about a decade later Mount Le Conte, and the surrounding region, was protected as part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Geology Mount Le Conte lies in the Appalachian Blue Ridge geologic and physiographic province. It is made up of Late Proterozoic rocks; mostly metamorphosed sandstone, siltstone, shale, and conglomerate formed over 800–450 million years ago. Millions of years of weathering has caused significant erosion, giving the mountains in the region, including Le Conte, a distinctive, gentle sloping feature. A dense stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest, a remnant of the last Ice Age, coats the mountain's peaks and upper slopes.  Climate  Mount Le Conte has a humid continental climate (Dfb) bordering on a subalpine climate (Dfc) due to its elevation, giving it cool summers, and cold winters. Annual snowfall averages 40 inches near the base to 80 inches on the highest peak. The climate is much cooler and somewhat wetter than the lower elevations. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -32 °F, on January 13, 1986. The highest temperature ever recorded was 82 °F on July 1, 2012. LeConte Lodge The office of the LeConte Lodge Mount Le Conte is notable for having the highest inn providing lodging for visitors in the Eastern United States. The LeConte Lodge is a small resort, established in 1925, located on the top of the mountain. First, it was a tent, then a single cabin, and now it is a series of small personal log cabins and a central lodge/dining hall situated along the top of a mountain. It can accommodate about 50 guests a night, and is generally open from March–November. There is no transportation to the lodge and all guests must hike in on one of the five trails that access the mountain. Due to this lack of access, supplies must be brought in via helicopter and llama pack trains.Morgan Simmons, \\"Mount Le Conte Llama Packer Reaches End of the Trail,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 14 November 2011. Retrieved: 14 November 2011. The climate at the lodge is similar to that found in southern Canada, with cool summers and cold, snowy winters. Currently, the lodge is maintained under a lease with the National Park Service. Access View from Cliff Tops atop Mount LeConte Le Conte's location in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has spurred the creation of five trails that lead to the LeConte Lodge, with spur trails to each of the individual peaks. In addition to the scenic overlooks and peaceful woodlands endemic to each path, every trail offers its own unique attractions along the way to the summit. They are listed with their distances one-way as follows * Alum Cave Trail — ;Manning (1991) Alum Cave Creek, Arch Rock, Alum Cave Bluff and views into Huggins Hell decorate the trail; it is both the most scenic and often used trail. * The Boulevard Trail — ( from Newfound Gap); Begins on the crest of the Great Smoky Mountains east of Newfound Gap on the Appalachian Trail; it never dips below . * Bullhead Trail — ; The least traveled path, it offers the most solitude. * Rainbow Falls Trail — ; LeConte Creek runs alongside the trail until Rainbow Falls, the single highest drop of water in the national park. * Trillium Gap Trail — ; The trail passes behind Grotto Falls, the only opportunity to walk behind a waterfall in the park; Trillium Gap offers spring wildflowers and a short spur hike to Brushy Mountain; the only horse trail on the mountain; the llama trains that supply the lodge use this trail. Starting the Trillium Gap Trail at the Trillium Gap parking lot shortens the climb by , making this a trail. The combined traffic of these five trails makes Mount Le Conte one of the most heavily traversed mountains in the park. The Alum Cave and Rainbow Falls trails in particular tend to become overcrowded with visitors seeking rewarding payoffs just a few miles into the trails. Hikers can stay in an Appalachian Trail style shelter overnight for $4, limited to 12 spots, with a backcountry permit and reservations from the National Park Service. The area was affected by the 2016 Southeastern United States wildfires. The park, including the area around Mt. Le Conte, was evacuated during the disaster.

The Legion of Net.Heroes, or LNH, is the oldest (and perhaps the first) Usenet-based shared universe still in existence, and the name of the premiere \\"net.hero\\" team in that universe. Birthed from a rec.arts.comics cascade thread in April 1992 , it began as parody of the Legion of Super-Heroes (LSH), and other comic book superheroes. It featured characters like Cheesecake-Eater Lad (based on Matter-Eater Lad) and Super Apathy Lad defending the “Looniverse” from the likes of Lagneto (\\"Lag\\" spliced with \\"Magneto\\") and Doctor Killfile. Over time, it has evolved to include comedy, serious drama, character pieces and melodrama. With 181 stories posted in 2007, it is still active. History In the beginning On April 27, 1992, rec.arts.comics member Bill Sherman, commenting on the correct spelling of the name Winsor McCay, declared himself \\"Spelling Boy\\" of the LSH. Two days later, Dan'l Danehy Oakes suggested that long-time posters form a Legion of Net. Heroes. He declared himself California Kid, \\"whose power is to read comix weeks after everyone else has discussed 'em...\\" The thread took off, spawning 115 (mostly) on-topic replies and a large and diverse pool of \\"net.heroes\\". On May 5, Steve Librande, no doubt growing tired of the thread, declared himself \\"the ingenious Doctor Killfile\\" , threatening to \\"release the awesome force of my patented Kill-O-Ray, destroying all posts about you blithering Net.Heroes!!\\" Benjamin Pierce, in the net.persona of Marvel_Zombie Lad, rallied his fellow \\"net.heroes\\" to fight back. It was at this point that forty-four different authors began working on the first actual LNH story, later called The Cosmic Plot Device Caper. At that time, Usenet users were primarily college students, and when summer vacation came, interest in the LNH waned. Come the fall, interest was stirred up again, primarily because of Todd \\"Scavenger\\" Kogutt. New LNH stories and new authors debuted on rec.arts.comics.misc (rec.arts.comics had become defunct in late 1992). Some authors created continuing \\"series\\", with issue numbers and serialised stories; the first of these was Kyle Lucke's Quest for Cheeze, soon followed by Ray \\"wReam\\" Bingham's Ultimate Ninja. The newsgroup shuffle Many posters on rec.arts.comics.misc were annoyed by the LNH stories in what was primarily a discussion newsgroup. The LNH moved to their very own newsgroup, alt.comics.lnh, before finding their permanent home on rec.arts.comics.creative. RACC also hosts a number of other original fiction shared universes, such as ASH, OMEGA and 8FOLD. Occasionally RACC receives cross-posts from Superguy. It is moderated by Russ \\"Eagle\\" Allbery, who also maintains the eyrie ftp archives. The Looniverse The world of the LNH, known as the Looniverse, is an alternate universe much like our own, but with the presence of net.heroes, net.ahumans, and net.villains. One notable difference, besides the presence of superpowers, is that the vast majority of LNH characters are aware of the fourth wall: they know that they are fictional characters in fictional stories, and often will comment on bad characterizations and ludicrous plot-twists, sometimes talking directly to the audience or their author. Sometimes, the plot-twists themselves come out of fourth-wall breaking. For example, in Gary St. Lawrence's story, The Case of the Clueless Mystery, the characters discover how to defeat the villain by consulting the script. Metafictional concepts such as Comedy and Drama are treated like real cosmic forces. The Looniverse is also notable for its ability to simultaneously contain mutually exclusive ideas. In the work of Hubert Bartels, for example, mainstream comic books are treated something akin to movies: heroes audition for the likes of Rob Liefeld and Marv Wolfman and model for the penciller. Other authors treat the work of Marvel and DC as comic books that are products of their writer's imagination. Still others use parody titles to represent mainstream comics, i.e., Justice Mind-Wipers of America instead of Justice League of America, New Adventists instead of New Avengers. Some characters operate in a world of realistic physics; others operate by the laws of Cartoon physics. For some characters, time unfolds akin to real-world time; for others, all their lives have taken place in \\"the last ten years\\". Yet these characters can often meet and team-up in the same time- frame. Humour The humour of the LNH has broadened considerably from its joke-name beginnings, and now includes broad parody, subtle satire, and character humour. However, there are some major trends that have remained a constant thread throughout its lifetime. The two prime targets of LNH parody are superheroes, and the Internet. In fact, net terminology and conventions extends even to the naming of characters and places: for example, Lurking Girl and Lurker Lad derive their invisibility powers from \\"lurkers\\", newsgroup readers who do not actively take part in the discussion, but rather, \\"lurk\\". Many of the cities in the Looniverse have net-based names: Net.ropolis and Sig.ago, for example. Fictional history Since the day Dr. Killfile attacked the LNH, a number of LNH Writers have filled in the gaps within the Looniverse's back history. Retcons, however, often make the task of history scribing very difficult in an ever-changing Looniverse. The more popular ideas tend to remain and the other ones tend to disappear. Backstory Back during the 19th century, Net.ropolis was known as Babbagetown. Little is known of how far the origins of this city go back. The history of the LNHQ is also rather murky. What is known though is that the current LNHQ used to be the Net.ropolis Hotel Grand. Sometime in the 1920s or 1930s, a hero by the name of Boy Lad formed the Legion of Net. Heroes. During this time, he was the only member (Boy Lad Jr., his sidekick, wasn't allowed to join, due to the \\"no sidekicks are allowed to join\\" rule). No one knows what ultimately happened to him although someone who claimed to be him made an appearance in the Omaha Project series. After Boy Lad disappeared, the Agents of P.U.L.P, Classic Squad, and Society of Wireless Heroes (A British-based super group) took over the hero game in the 1940s and 1950s. Some members of the Classic Squad would eventually become part of the current LNH incarnation like Old Comics Man, Golden Man, and Kid Yesterdaze. During the 1960s, the Net.astic Nine and the Challengers of the Abominable helped protect Net.ropolis and the Looniverse from destructive forces. The LNHer Sig.Lad was formerly a member of the Net.astic Nine. At the end of the 60's, a demon going by the name of Anti- Christ Lad controlled all of Net.ropolis including the LNH that was operating during this time period: The Legion of Net. Hippies. Self-Righteous Preacher, after joining with the Legion of Net.Hippies helped free the LNH from Anti- Christ Lad's control and sent him back to hell. A few Legion of Net. Hippies like Nudist Man, Super Apathy Lad, and Procrastination Boy remained with the current Legion. In the 1980s, The Legion of New-Wave Heroes arrived on the scene and quickly disappeared. As to when the current incarnation of the LNH got its start is a subject of some debate. It could have begun a few days or a few years before the Cosmic Plot Device Caper depending on which stories one reads. The LNH begins After the Cosmic Plot Device Caper, came the 2½ Month Gap, a mysterious period of which little is known. During this time period, Rebel Yell became leader of the LNH and Y-Plex Burp replaced Lurking Girl with an evil clone called Lurking Lass. After that a number of crises took shape. During a time called Beige Noon, two god like beings called Dekay and Diskolor attempted to drain the color from the Looniverse and turn it into a wasteland. This was followed by the RMGrouping of rec.arts.comics, which caused the entire LNH to be scattered across the Net. In 501 Blues: The Long Road to Nowhere, Rebel Yell tried to find all of the lost legionaries and succeeded in finding Lurking Girl. This was followed by Cry.Sig, a parody of Crisis on Infinite Earths, where the Crossover Queen caused tons of havoc (including destroying Canada with a reality ray). Cry.Sig gave LNH Writers an excuse for rampant retconning of continuity. Dial-D-for-Dvandom became the Dvandom Stranger and Pre-Cry.Sig Occultism Kid became the August One, mentor to the Post-Cry.Sig Occultism Kid. Post-Cry. Sig The Ultimate Ninja joined with the LNH after Cry. Sig. Somewhere along the line the leadership of the LNH became a triumvirate with Rebel Yell, Continuity Champ, and the Ultimate Ninja each taking a share of LNH power. In the Integrity Quest, written by Doug P. Wojtowicz, Stephane Savoie, and Hubert Bartels, the characters Lost Cause Boy, Kid Anarky, and Panta the cat-girl were introduced; in the tenth installment, Wojtowicz referred to a penile erection as a \\"woody\\": this caused a minor controversy dubbed \\"The Woody Scandal\\", and resulted in the ostracization of Wojtowicz. Other stories of this era also skirted the line of good taste: Gary St. Lawrence's stories Pigs in Space and Passionfishing, however, produced a much less volatile reaction. These three stories challenged the notions of what was acceptable content in LNH stories and led to the development of a \\"mature audiences\\" label, Acraphobe. In 1993, Rebel Yell, due to events depicted in the Lurk of Faith, took a leave of absence from the LNH (never returning), leaving the Ultimate Ninja in complete control. Myk-El was revealed to be a traitor and killed by the Ultimate Ninja. The Secret Dvanders dug up Myk-El's grave, not convinced that he was indeed a traitor in Constellation #27, which set up the beginning for Retcon Hour. Retcon Hour, a parody of Zero Hour, was the biggest planned crossover the LNH has ever had. At least fourteen writers took part in it, it touched both the PULP and NTB imprints, and also was linked with the Omaha Project series. During the chaos involved with transferring the Looniverse from alt.comics.lnh to rec.arts.comics.creative, two Time Crappers (post and pre-Cry. Sig), and wReamicus Maximus (wielding the all-powerful Ring of Retcon) washed the Looniverse over with a number of retcons in order to take control of it. Contraption Man was revealed to be the traitor he had been sent to stop. The resurrected and vindicated Myk-El became the consort of the RACCelestial Madonna. After the dust settled a few heroes, like Sig. Lad, left for a new life. And some new heroes, like the Legion of Occult Heroes, joined the LNH. A brain dead Dr. Killfile was totally obliterated in Looniverse Adrift and the supervillain Tsar Chasm appeared to die too. Pocket Man married Organic Lass in the first LNH wedding. Post-retcon hour In 1995 in Dvandom Force #48, Sig. Lad was killed by Squidman (formerly the LNHer called Squid Boy) to prevent a dystopian future where he would have killed the entire LNH. In 1997 Tsar Chasm returned from the dead and it was revealed that he was posing as the LNHer Kid G. In 1998, Dr. Killfile also returned with no explanation of how he had cheated death in the pages of Teenfactor. In 1999 in Tales of the LNH #370, Panta was retconned out of existence, sacrificing herself to save the Looniverse from the Collector. In 2000, Hexadecimal Luthor became President of the Loonited States. In 2004, he was re-elected. In March 2001, the city of Sig.ago was completely destroyed (it would eventually be restored). In July 2001, a number of LNHers were married including Deja Dude, Master Blaster and Sister State the Obvious, Innovative Offense Boy and Ordinary Lady, and Cheesecake Eater Lad and aLLiterative Lass . Since then a few of them have become parents. In the 2006 Mid-Term Election, Haiku Gorilla won a seat as Senator for the \\"floating\\" city of Net.ropolis. In 2007, the Ultimate Ninja decided to take a vacation which kicked off Infinite Leadership Crisis, a storyline in LNH Comics Presents written by nine writers. Every day in April, a different member of the LNH became leader and disappeared. There were 465 days in this Infinite April. The conclusion led to the Beige Countdown series, which counted down to the 2008 event Beige Midnight parodying the concept of never ending comic book events. The legion The headquarters of the LNH (called LNHHQ or LNHQ) is based in Net.ropolis and houses literally hundreds of members. The ever-expanding and out-of-control roster is one of the key conceits of the Legion. The team does lend itself nicely to several less unwieldy sub-groups. The LNH are, for the most part, a privately funded but government-sanctioned team, responding to crises both cosmic and mundane; one sub-group, the TSK Force, is chosen to deal with minor annoyances. Legionnaires (also known as LNHers or LNH'rs) are given free room and board at LNHQ, plus a small allowance for purchases. How one gains membership into the LNH depends on the author writing the story: many stories feature characters rejected by the Legion who go off to form their own teams; other stories, featuring much less powerful characters, find those characters accepted instantly. LNHQ Like physics and aging in the Looniverse as a whole, the features of LNHQ are mutable depending on who is writing the story. A general-use floor-plan is available, and there are a number of features that are generally consistent from interpretation to interpretation: LNHQ as a building has many unusual properties. For example, its rooms expand to fit the number of people within the room, making for a building that is much larger inside than it appears outside (something akin to a TARDIS.) It possesses a nearly infinite number of sub-basements (each level identified by an additional \\"sub\\", as in, sub-sub-sub-sub-basement) which are host to a number of ghosts, supernatural creatures, kiwis, and a species of incredibly stupid bird known as the Oozelfinch. Not only does LNHQ provide living space for its hundreds of members, but it also contains a multitude of ways for them to pass their downtime. The Peril Room is a training room akin to those used by many hero teams, fraught with boobytraps and holographic opponents. One of the unique features of the Peril Room is that, Bugtown-like, one cannot sustain lasting injury within; many stories pit a would-be legionnaire against the Ultimate Ninja in mortal combat: if they last more than a minute before he slices them in twain, then they are granted membership. The LNH also has a more general-use holodeck and swimming pool. The Hall of Lost Heroes contains memorials to those who have fallen in battle. The Ultimate Ninja apparently has his own personal garden for meditation and tea, where he also grows his own supply of Ninja bush. It has been hinted in some stories that LNHQ is itself sentient. WCs and NWCs The original LNH characters have been designated as writer characters, or WCs. This is because these characters were intended largely as extensions of their authors' personalities; for example, Brian Perler says that he can easily remember useless information, but cannot retain useful facts: thus, he is Obscure Trivia Lad. As the stories became more sophisticated, a number of non-writer characters, or NWCs, were created. Many LNH authors still have a character that serves as an author surrogate, but by-and-large the distinction between WCs and NWCs has blurred. Some characters are owned by their creators or other writers; others are free for use by any writer. The cast Because the LNH is so large, to list all of its members in this article would be nearly impossible. What follows are a half-dozen characters whose names and concepts are the most essentially LNH- like. * Ultimate Ninja: the leader of the LNH, he possesses any ability that is construed as being oriental in nature. He is a master martial artist, a stern but effective leader, and uses maple seeds (or \\"Ninja Bush\\") to propel himself into a deadly rage. Part of the tension in the character is that, at any moment, at the drop of a hat, he could kill the entire Legion. * Cannon Fodder: possessing the ability to be killed, only to appear again in the next issue; no matter where he is killed, he always regenerates within the Peril Room. * Catalyst Lass: one of the Ninja's most trusted deputies, Cat possesses the ability to convince others to share her interests (thus being the catalyst for new hobbies and opinions). How she does this, and her general personality, is a point of contention: some authors write her as being very domineering, others as very sexy (or, for that matter, ditzy and frivolous), while some try to integrate all these various ideas. * Kid Recap: possessing the uncanny ability to recap what happened in previous stories. * Master Blaster: a chauvinist pig who uses \\"Mack Daddy Vibes\\" to seduce unsuspecting women. He is often seen using a large gun and spouting ridiculous opinions. His sexism has mellowed somewhat since his marriage to Sister State-the-Obvious, who—obviously—has the ability to state that which is obvious. * CAPTAIN CAPITALIZE: he speaks only in capital letters; this is a reference to bad netiquette. * Kid Kirby: a cosmic being with many untold cosmic powers and infallible wisdom, including the ability to be the tallest person in the room. These are derived from the Power Kirby. He also has an army of Kirbybots who often take his place in stories. With the exception of Kid Kirby, all these characters occupy the large pool of characters who can be used freely by any writer, a possible reason for their popularity and the universe's general longevity. Evolution The LNH is not only a parody universe: over the last fourteen years, it has been expanded upon to include a number of stories, characters, tones, and spin-offs. Series Among the most acclaimed of the LNH canon are: * Aeneas and Ferris: K. M. Wilcox's elegiac and mysterious series chronicles the strange friendship of housemates Aeneas Boddy (an immortal net.villain) and Ferris \\"Deductive Logic Man\\" Jones (a member of the LNH). * Alt. Riders: Jamas Enright's straight superhero adventure series follows a team under the leadership of the mysterious and ruthless Agent. The Alt. Riders seek to assess and, if necessary, intercept, possible dangers to the Looniverse before they become a problem. Dvandom Force, as drawn by the author, Dave Van Domelen. * Dvandom Force: Dave Van Domelen's series is a mixture of high drama, political intrigue, and anime-based parody. Probably one of the most admired series on RACC, it ended its run with issue # 100. * Easily-Discovered Man: Rob Rogers's series follows the green glowing radioactive net.hero, Professor Theodore Wong, who has the ability to be easily discovered. The series, narrated by his sidekick, Easily-Discovered Man Lite, is goofy but more character and situation-based than parody. * Limp- Asparagus Lad: Saxon Brenton's series starring the man with the powers and personality of limp asparagus. Like Martin Phipps in LNH, Brenton often addresses meta-fictional themes in this chronically late series. * LNH: One of the flagship titles of the LNH, it is one of the sillier series. Writer Martin Phipps often uses this series (and his other stories) to explore metafictional conceits, such as the relationship between an author and his fiction. The series was relaunched in 2005 as Legion of Net.Heroes Vol. 2, written by multiple authors. * LNH Triple Play: Joltin' Jeff McCoskey wrote this series, featuring \\"three-way team-ups\\" between superheroes. The comedy in the series was often gentle and character-based; it is also notable for giving deeper characterizations to one-note characters, such as Self-Righteous Preacher. * Misfits: Jennifer Whiston's dark, turbulent and emotional melodrama charts the supernatural adventures of Brittany, Payton, and Savannah: the Misfits. * Saviors of the Net: One of the most successful examples of a cascade story—a sort of round-robin style of fiction writing, only without any pre-planning or set order for authors to write in—this parody of Morrison's JLA and Busiek's Thunderbolts introduces a rival group of heroes who create a god-like being called The Mechanical Author in order to bring about a painless, utopian society. The Author took control of the Looniverse for a couple of years, although the LNH was completely unaware of this until the end of another cascade, Mutton Mania. * Tales of the LNH: Hubert Bartel's Panta walked a delicate line between extremes of sexiness, innocence, and violence, making her an extremely popular character, even after Bartels erased her from existence. * Writer's Block Woman (and Mouse): Jessica Ihimaera-Smiler's comedy series follows overly enthusiastic net.heroine Writer's Block Woman and her wise-cracking daughter-cum-sidekick, Mouse. Spin-off imprints * The Net. Trenchcoat Brigrade: The NTB was the first and probably the most significant of all the LNH spin-offs. Like the LNH it sprang to life from a cascade . The NTB consists of a bunch of trenchcoat wearing, chain-smoking bastards that are constantly manipulating people. * The PULP Imprint: Jeff McCoskey created the PULP Imprint to tell Pulp Fiction type tales set in the LNH's past. Agents of the Pulp is the flagship title of the imprint. It eventually expanded into telling stories beyond the scope of the LNH Imprint. * The LNH-Men Universe: Jeff McCoskey wrote an acclaimed series called The Golden LNH-Men which put a revamped version of the LNH into a dark grim and gritty Watchmen like Universe. Peter \\"Tick\\" Milan and Matthew \\"Badger\\" Rossi wrote a sequel to it called LNH-Men: The Silver Age. * League of Heroes: This was an imprint created by Ben Rawluk to tell stories set in an alternate universe called Earth B. This universe has been destroyed. * The Order of St. Doomas: This is a group of vigilantes that roams the Net hunting down sphammers. After rec.arts.comics.creative became moderated this imprint pretty much died down. * The RACCCafe: Not really a spin-off, but an out-of- continuity café where LNHers hang out along with other characters from the variety of RACC Imprints. It tends to be dominated by LNH characters though. * The LNH2 Imprint: An imprint created by Martin Phipps set in a possible LNH future. * The LNHY Imprint: An imprint created by Arthur Spitzer involving stories set in the Looniverse Y universe. Unlike the Classic Looniverse, each writer in this universe is allowed to have only one character in the LNH. * The LNH20 Imprint An imprint created by several LNH Writers to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the LNH. Significance and legacy With well over a thousand stories posted by over a hundred authors, the LNH is the predominant Usenet-based shared writing universe, and the most active of all the rec.arts.comics.creative universes. In May 1994, the estimated readership of alt.comics.lnh was 45,000. The LNH has had writers from places as diverse as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, the Philippines, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand write for it. It is an \\"open universe\\"—— meaning that anyone can join, providing they abide by basic netiquette and respect the intellectual property of others —— and this openness is probably a key part of its continued life.

This image represents copy B, printed and painted in 1789 and currently held by the Library of Congress. A shepherd's crook is a long and sturdy stick with a hook at one end, often with the point flared outwards, used by a shepherd to manage and sometimes catch sheep. In addition, the crook may aid in defending against attack by predators. When traversing rough terrain, a crook is an aid to balance. Shepherds may also use the long implement to part thick undergrowth (for example at the edge of a drovers' road) when searching for lost sheep or potential predators. Symbolic use The crook and flail on the coffinette of Tutankhamun The innovation of a hook facilitates the recovery of fallen animals by ensnaring them by the neck or leg. For this reason the crook has been used as a religious symbol of care (particularly in difficult circumstances), including the Christian bishop's crosier.Caeremoniale Episcoporum (Vatican Polyglott Press, 1985) In medicine, the term shepherd’s crook is used to describe a right coronary artery that follows an unusually high and winding route. This variant, which has a prevalence of about 5%, imposes technical problems in angioplasty procedures. Thalia, Muse of comedy in Greek mythology, was usually portrayed holding a shepherd's crook. The shepherd's crook and the flail (an agricultural tool) are insignia of pharaonic authority: the Crook and flail.

As Caoimhin Mac Giolla Leith of University College Dublin has said, > \\"Gillick's practice to date has encompassed a wide range of media and > activities (including sculpture, writing, architectural and graphic design, > film, and music) as well as various critical and curatorial projects, his > work as a whole is also marked by a fondness for diversions and > distractions, tangents and evasions.\\" Mural, Balfour Avenue, Belfast, 2008 The focus of Gillick' practice is evaluations of the aesthetics of social systems with a focus on modes of production rather than consumption. He is interested in forms of social organization. Through his own writings and the use of specific materials in his artworks, Gillick examines how the built world carries traces of social, political and economic systems. As art critic Ina Blom has said, > \\"Artists such as Liam Gillick ... no longer address abstraction as the > principle for the creation of distinct minimalist objects, but rather try to > create through design spaces for open social interaction [artworks] whose > actual use is to be constantly redefined within the situation of the > exhibition - without necessarily producing relational-aesthetic models of > community.\\"Blom, Ina, \\"THE LOGIC OF THE TRAILER: Abstraction, Style, and > Sociality in Contemporary Art\\", Texte Zur Kunst, March 2008, Issue 69, pp. > 171-77 Central to Gillick's practice are the publications that function in parallel to his artworks. An anthology of these \\"Allbooks\\" was published by Book Works, in 2009. Documents Series with Henry Bond Between 1990 and 1994, Gillick collaborated with artist Henry Bond on their Documents Series, a group of 83 fine art works which appropriated the modus operandi of a news gathering team, in order to produce relational art.Henry Bond & Liam Gillick, \\"Press Kitsch,\\" Flash Art International, Issue 165, July/August 1992, p. 65-66. In order to make the work, the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association's Gazette — a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous press kit before preparing his audio recording device. The series was first shown commercially in 1991, at Karsten Schubert LimitedKarsten Schubert (ed) Henry Bond and Liam Gillick: Documents (London: Karsten Schbert Limited, 1991.) and then, in 1992, at Maureen Paley's Interim ArtMaureen Paley (ed.)

The U.S. presentation of the exhibition was the most comprehensive of Gillick's work in an American museum. Accompanying his solo exhibition at the MCA was the show The one hundred and sixty-third floor: Liam Gillick Curates the Collection, curated by Gillick from the MCA collection. In 2016, Gillick presented a solo exhibition, titled Campaign at Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto.[https://www.serralves.pt/en/activities/liam-gillick-campaign/ \\"Liam Gillick: Campaign\\", Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto, 28 January - 08 January 2017 Art market Gillick is represented in the UK by Maureen Paley, in the US by Casey Kaplan, and in Ireland by Kerlin Gallery. Personal life and family Gillick is cousin to British artists James and Theodore Gillick. He was married to artist Sarah Morris, in 1998 at a ceremony in Miami. They divorced in 2012.

It includes the pilots who flew with the bona fide Lafayette Escadrille squadron. Numbers The estimations of number of pilots range from 180 to over 300. The generally accepted number of pilots who successfully completed French flight training is 209. Of these, 180 served in combat. More than 50 Flying Corps personnel (including members of the Lafayette Escadrille) initially served in the Ambulance Corps of the American Field Service. AFS Surgeon-General Col. Edmund L. Gros, M.D. is credited with initiating the corps. Casualties and honors Sixty-nine Corps members died during the war, 42 of them in action against the enemy. The rest were results of disease, accidents, wounds, and suicide. The planes weren't very sturdy, and sometimes guns jammed too, just when they were needed. The Corps is credited with 159 enemy kills. It amassed 31 Croix de guerre, and its pilots were awarded seven Médailles militaires and four Légions d'honneur. Eleven of its members were deemed flying aces, claiming five air kills or more. The core squadron suffered nine losses and was credited with 41 victories. Note There is frequent confusion between the terms Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps, exacerbated by the inaccuracies in the movie Flyboys.

The inquiry was headed by The Honourable Geoffrey Davies AO QC, a former Supreme Court judge of appeal. Establishment The commission was established by the Queensland Governor-In-Council in 2005 to investigate, among other things, the conduct of Dr Jayant Patel, a former surgeon of Bundaberg Base Hospital. It was not a Royal Commission and therefore had limited powers. The Commission commenced after the failure of a similar commission headed by Mr Tony Morris, called the Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry. Bundaberg Hospital administrators Darren Keating and Peter Leck undertook a court case against Morris. The Morris Inquiry was wound up after Supreme Court Justice Martin Moynihan found Mr Morris had been biased. Hearings began on 23 May 2005. Findings The commission found gross negligence in Patel's conduct, as well as systematic failures of management to deal with the problem. Davies recommended that Patel be referred to the public prosecutor for consideration of manslaughter, fraud, and assault charges. In total seventeen patient deaths were referred to police. An extradition process was begun after the police issued a warrant for Patel, acting on 14 offences. The report also found that amongst Queensland Health bureaucrats concerns regarding \\"significant and sustained statewide adverse publicity\\" were rated as significant as \\"loss of life\\". The state chief health officer at the time, Dr Gerry FitzGerald was criticised for his own investigation into Patel, describing it as too positive.

The Married Virgin (also known as Frivolous Wives) is a 1918 American silent drama film starring Vera Sisson, Kathleen Kirkham and Rudolph Valentino (credited as Rodolfo di Valentina). During the early part of his career, Valentino was often cast as a villain or \\"heavy,\\" his part in The Married Virgin reflects this typecasting. Synopsis Mary McMillan (Sisson) is the daughter of tycoon John McMillan (Jobson). She is deeply in love with Douglas McKee (Newburg), a promising young lawyer. Mary's dour \\"evil stepmother\\", Ethel (Kirkham) is carrying on an affair with the diabolical Count Roberto di San Fraccini (Valentino). John McMillan is wracked with guilt over his involvement in a violent skirmish, in which a man was killed. While McMillan was not responsible for the murder, he did fire a weapon in the scuffle, and fears he could be implicated. He keeps the gun he used locked away in a safe in his office. Ethel knows the secret, and shares it with Roberto. They arrange to have the weapon stolen from the office and extort McMillan for money for its safe and quiet return. McMillan meets with Roberto, but refuses his demands for money. The lovers move on to Plan B, which involves the virtuous Mary. They plot to force Mary to marry Roberto, and use the dowry to escape to Argentina together. Mary is understandably reluctant to go along with the plan, but eventually acquiesces to save her father from a life sentence in prison. She writes to Douglas, calling off their engagement, sadly marries Roberto and retires to an unhappy existence in her home. Roberto, at first, promises to stay away from Mary until she comes to him of her own free will. Eventually, when it is apparent Mary wants nothing to do with him, he attempts to break into her room and rape her. She is saved only through the intervention of the kindly family servant, Annie (Leighton). Ethel grows increasingly jealous of the attention, albeit unwanted, that Mary is receiving from Roberto. On a drive through the hills, she brandishes a bottle of poison and threatens to use it unless Roberto takes the next boat to South America with her. Roberto attempts to take the bottle away from her, a struggle ensues, and the car loses control and tumbles off a cliff, killing Ethel. Meanwhile, Douglas works tirelessly to clear McMillan and save Mary. He meets with Roberto, who agrees to permanently leave, dowry money in hand. He and Mary have a happy reconciliation. Eventually, McMillan is completely exonerated. Mary's marriage to Roberto is annulled because it was never consummated, and she is free to marry Douglas.

The rights to the film were then acquired by Fidelity Pictures Company in 1920. The Married Virgin was subsequently re-edited (from seven reels to six reels) and released under the title its original title and under the new title Frivolous Wives. After Valentino became a star in 1921, the film's director Joe Maxwell released the re-edited version again to capitalize on Valentino's fame. Film preservationist David Shepard later discovered the footage believed to have been cut from the original release in Belgium, Luxembourg, and at the Library of Congress. Shepard re-added the footage to the edited print to recreate the original print of The Married Virgin. Preservation status A print of The Married Virgin still survives and is held at the Library of Congress.

Mental branch  The mental branch escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen, supplies the chin, and anastomoses with the submental and inferior labial arteries.  Mylohyoid branch  As the inferior alveolar artery enters the foramen, it gives off a mylohyoid branch which runs in the mylohyoid groove, and supplies the mylohyoid muscle.

She was the middle child and only daughter of U.S. President William Howard Taft and his wife Helen Herron.  Personal life  Like her older brother Robert and younger brother Charles, Helen Taft was a high achiever. She was able to reach goals that her mother had not been granted access to due to the social restrictions placed on women of her mother's time. She earned a scholarship to attend Bryn Mawr College, where she was a student when her father was elected president in 1908. Taft's studies were interrupted for some time when her mother suffered a stroke, and was left an invalid. She moved into the White House with her family, and helped her mother to regain body movement and speech. Taft also served as official hostess for many White House functions while her mother was disabled. In December, 1910, she was given a debutante party at the White House. After her mother recovered, she resumed her studies at Bryn Mawr, graduating in 1915 with a bachelor's degree in history. She was a suffragette, and traveled the country, giving speeches in support of the vote for women and women's rights. On July 15, 1920, she married Yale history professor Frederick Johnson Manning (1894-1966), who then moved to Swarthmore College. The Mannings had two daughters: * Helen Taft Manning Hunter (October 5, 1921 – October 17, 2013) * Caroline Manning Cunningham (January 18, 1925 - March 23, 2020) Both daughters also pursued careers in teaching.  Academic career  In 1917, aged only 26, Taft became dean of Bryn Mawr, and served as the college's acting president in 1919. She then attended Yale University, where she earned a doctorate in history. Taft's research interests centered on the history of North America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1925, she returned to Bryn Mawr as dean and professor of history. She served as dean until 1941, and taught history until she retired in 1957, having become head of the department. She continued to research and to publish during her retirement. Her papers, which include a collection of personal correspondence, professional work, and her husband's work are stored at Bryn Mawr College.  Death  Taft died in 1987 at age 95 of pneumonia in a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was buried at Church of the Redeemer Cemetery in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She was the last surviving child of William Howard Taft, her siblings having died in 1953 and 1983. She was survived by her children.

Structure The lateral femoral circumflex artery arises from the lateral side of the profunda femoris artery, passes horizontally between the divisions of the femoral nerve, and behind the sartorius and rectus femoris, and divides into ascending, transverse, and descending branches. The lateral femoral circumflex artery may occasionally arise directly from the femoral artery. The artery usually courses anterior to the femoral neck and in between the branches of femoral nerve. A rare variant where the artery passes posterior to the femoral nerve has also been reported which is of great significance to the surgeon. Branches The lateral circumflex femoral artery has three branches: # The ascending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery passes upward, beneath the tensor fasciae latae muscle, to the lateral aspect of the hip, and anastomoses with the terminal branches of the superior gluteal and deep circumflex iliac artery. # The descending branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery runs downward, behind the rectus femoris, upon the vastus lateralis, to which it gives offsets; one long branch descends in the muscle as far as the knee, and anastomoses with the superior lateral genicular artery. It is accompanied by the branch of the femoral nerve to the vastus lateralis muscle. # The transverse branch of lateral circumflex femoral artery is a small artery in the thigh. It is the smallest branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and passes lateralward over the vastus intermedius, pierces the vastus lateralis, and winds around the femur, just below the greater trochanter, anastomosing on the back of the thigh with the medial femoral circumflex artery, the inferior gluteal artery, and the perforating arteries of the profunda femoris artery.

L. Sharkey, was an Australian trade unionist and communist leader. From 1948 to 1965 he served as the Secretary-General of Communist Party of Australia (CPA). Sharkey was an orthodox Communist throughout his political career, closely following the prevailing Soviet line in each major turn of policy. Biography Early years Lawrence Sharkey was born on 18 August 1898 at Warree Creek, near Cargo, via Orange, New South Wales. His farming parents, Michael and Mary, were Irish and raised him as a Roman Catholic: a religious background he would share with numerous other Australian communist officials. He left school when only 14 years old, and commenced an apprenticeship as a coachmaker in Orange. Later he worked as a farmhand,Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; p. 424. claiming that itinerant bushworkers drew him into the anti- conscription struggle during World War I and into support of the Industrial Workers of the World. After World War I Sharkey moved to Sydney and obtained a job as a lift attendant, also becoming a militant activist in the Sydney Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union.Stuart Macintyre, The Reds: The Communist Party of Australia from Origins to Illegality. Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 1998; p. 134. In 1922 Sharkey became a member of the Sydney labor union council.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 424. Sharkey was elected to the executive of the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, but lost that post in another election in 1925. In 1928 he became a union delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales. Political career By this stage Sharkey had already been a member of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) for four years.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 424. Elected to the executive of the CPA in 1926, he was dismissed from it the following year, when he resisted the turn from a 'united front' with the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In 1928, he re- emerged as a strong advocate of the Comintern's new 'Third Period' line of opposition to all forms of reform. Sharkey was elected to the CPA's governing Central Committee and rose to prominence in the party alongside his factional allies Bert Moxon and J.B. Miles. After they won control of the party in 1929, Sharkey was appointed editor of the party's newspaper Workers' Weekly. He continued to edit that paper and another party publication, The Tribune, throughout the 1930s. Sharkey was named Chairman of the CPA in 1930. He remained in this post without interruption until 1948, despite the twists and turns of party policy during that time.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 424. In the summer of 1930 Sharkey visited the Soviet Union for the first time as one of the Australian party's representatives to the 5th World Congress of the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU).Macintyre, The Reds, p. 176. At the 7th World Congress of the Comintern Sharkey was elected as an alternate to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI).Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 424. When Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies declared the CPA illegal in June 1940, Sharkey and other party leaders went underground. A year later Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union entered the Second World War as an ally of Britain. The ban on members of the CPA was accordingly relaxed, and Sharkey resumed open political activity. In 1942 the ban was removed completely. With the onset of the Cold War Sharkey displaced Miles as the Australian Communist Party's Secretary- General. The CPA became openly hostile to the ALP, and withdrew its previous conditional support of the American-sponsored program of post-war reconstruction. General Secretary At the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of Australia between May 7–10, Sydney, New South Wales, Sharkey was elected General Secretary. He took over from Jack Miles whom stood down from nomination. On 9 June 1965, Sharkey's resignation of General Secretary of the Communist Party was accepted. Sharkey resigned due to ill- health and was replaced by Laurie Aarons. Portrait of Lance Sharkey at the time of his conviction for sedition in 1949. In March 1949 Sharkey told a Sydney journalist that \\"if Soviet Forces in pursuit of aggressors entered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them.\\" For this statement Sharkey was tried and convicted of sedition. The High Court upheld his conviction and he was sentenced to three years imprisonment, but eventually served a total of 13 months. On his release, he undertook a national speaking tour. He then spent six months at a sanatorium in the Soviet Union, for treatment of a heart condition. Under his strong leadership he was able to ensure that the CPA did what many other countries' Communist parties failed to do: namely, minimise the impact of Nikita Khrushchev's repudiation of Joseph Stalin early in 1956, and of the Soviet invasion of Hungary later that year. In November 1960 Sharkey attended the Meeting of 81 Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow, at which the CPA initially sympathised with the Chinese in the Sino-Soviet split. Ultimately, though, it backed the Soviets.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 424. Eleven months afterwards, Sharkey attended the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, pp. 424-425. Later years, death, and legacy Increasingly ill, Sharkey ceded supreme control of the CPA to Laurie Aarons in June 1965. Thereafter he held a ceremonial post as the party's Vice-Chairman.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p. 425. He died of a heart attack on 13 May 1967 in Sydney. His body was cremated. Sharkey was lauded by many in his wartime and post-war heyday as a hero, but his reputation sank during the 1960s, along with the fortunes of the party as a whole. In a 1998 book, the historian of Australian Communism Stuart Macintyre (who had long since abandoned his own CPA membership) noted the hyperbolic way in which Sharkey was portrayed during the cult of personality period of the 1930s: > \\"[Sharkey] was presented as a son of the soil, steeped in communist theory, > yet always a man of the people. The list of his virtues was directed so > unerringly to his limitations as to suggest parody. It was noted that 'like > all the leaders of our Party, Comrade Sharkey was temperate in his habits'; > in fact his binges in Moscow were notorious. He was a brilliant mass > agitator; actually his oratory was leaden. He had an instinctive genius; yet > when he took up Lenin's favourite pastime of chess, lesser party members had > to be careful to lose.\\"Macintyre, The Reds, p. 362.

Boneyard encased in sheet piling in Urbana Boneyard detention basin - Also known as Healey Street Basin Flood control park at 2nd St. and Springfield Ave. Boneyard Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 19, 2011 waterway that drains much of the cities of Champaign and Urbana, Illinois. It is a tributary of the Saline Branch of the Salt Fork Vermilion River, which is a tributary of the south-flowing Vermilion River and the Wabash River. The creek flows through the northern sections of the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The newsletter of the university's ACM chapter is Banks of the Boneyard, named after the creek.  History  In pre-settlement times, the Boneyard, like most of the other watercourses of Champaign County, Illinois, was probably a series of connected wetlands without a clearly defined channel. With settlement, the drainage was \\"improved\\". Today the Boneyard is a highly channelized stream, running in a slit trench, with steel sheet pilings along much of its length. There are several stories about the origin of the name \\"Boneyard\\". One is that the local Indians hung their dead over the stream, allowing the bones to fall into the creek, so that the creek was full of human bones when the first American settlers arrived. This could be an example of excarnation, which many Native American peoples indeed practiced. One problem with this story is that there have been no confirmed findings of human bones in excavations along the streams. In University of Illinois lore, the name \\"Boneyard\\" comes from the remains of poor students who could not handle the school's tough engineering curriculum. In the 1950s, Professor Karl B. Lohmann, Professor of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of Illinois, and Urbana Parks Commissioner, publicly advocated improving the Boneyard Creek. There are two articles in the Champaign News Gazette quoting Professor Lohmann with photographs of the Boneyard. Prior to the environmental movement in the late 1960s the Boneyard was an open sewer, with floating solids and a foul stench. During the 1970s many sources of pollution were removed, and water quality gradually improved. The Urbana- Champaign Sanitary District sewage outfall is located on the Saline Branch, just downstream from where the Boneyard enters that stream. Late in the 1970s, sewage chlorination, required by environmental regulations, was identified as a major negative factor for aquatic life. Although disinfection theoretically reduced the chances of hypothetical bathers contracting disease downstream of a sewage outfall, chlorination also killed most aquatic life for miles downstream. Late in the 1980s, the Sanitary District was allowed to discontinue chlorination. Fish soon returned to the Boneyard, after the chlorine block was removed from the Saline Branch. The fish, however, live a tenuous life on the Boneyard, which has frequently seen major fish kills as a result of spills and other accidents in the urbanized area. One branch of the Boneyard extends into South Neil Street, where it meets the headwaters of the Embarrass and Kaskaskia rivers. During the 1920s, the Illinois Central Railroad tracks were elevated in this area, to allow traffic to pass under the tracks. The rail embankment cut off the South Neil branch of the Boneyard, creating \\"Lake Neil\\" after a moderate rain event. This flooding would subside over several hours as the water flowed under the rail embankment through tiles. The City of Champaign, in cooperation with the University of Illinois, has set up a master plan for improving the creek's watershed. During the 1980s, \\"Lake Neil\\" was eliminated by placing larger tiles under the rail embankment. This, however, had the effect of creating flooding on the other side of the tracks, near Fourth and Green, where the branches of the Boneyard joined. In wet years, flooding caused damage estimated to be as much as $1000 per year. During the late 1990s, the City of Champaign resolved to eliminate the flooding near Fourth Street and Green Street. After considerable debate, the city built an enormous detention basin upstream of Fourth and Green streets, at a cost of approximately $22 million. The basin is designed to fill when the Boneyard approaches flood stage, preventing flooding at Fourth and Green streets up to a 100-year flood.

It is a political parable set in Japan in the Edo period. It deals with the poet Basho and the changing political landscape over about 35 years. The play won Bond the John Whiting Award for 1968.  Quotation  :Of course, that's only a symbol, but we need symbols to protect us from ourselves. The censor Because of the plays scenes of violence (it was known in the press as \\"The One With Five Dead Babies and a Disembowelling\\"), it was originally refused a theatrical license by the Lord Chamberlain, though permission was eventually given after Bond agreed to some last minute amendments. Original production It was first performed in 1968 for the Peoples and Cities conference at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, in a production directed by Jane Howell: *Basho, old, a priest - Peter Needham *Kiro, twenty - Paul Howes *Argi - Malcolm Ingram *Tola - Christopher Matthews *Heigoo - John Rowe *Breebree - Gordon Reid *Shogo, twenty-five - Edward Peel *Prime Minister - Peter Sproule *Commodore, forty-seven - Nigel Hawthorne *Georgina, thirty-nine - Susan Williamson *Peasants, soldiers, tars, tribesmen, etc. - *Alison King *Diana Berriman *Alan David *Geoffrey White *Vandra Edwards *Malcolm Ingram *Christopher Matthews *John Rowe *Gordon Reid *Peter Sproule Royal Court Theatre The play was then staged as part of an Edward Bond season at the Royal Court in 1969, to mark the abolition of stage censorship the previous year. Critical reception Bond said he \\"knew the critics would like it, and they did.\\" The Independent's Maeve Walsh reported that Narrow Road to the Deep North was found by the critics to be cryptic but was still admired overall. The Observer called it \\"a funny, ironic and beautiful play...In a series of short elegant scenelets, Brechtian in style, but with a sly mock-Zen lightness all their own, the play compares, and finally equates, the tyranny of brute force and religious conscience.\\" Clive Barnes of The New York Times, despite praising earlier productions, criticized the Vivian Beaumont Theater performance as \\"distressingly tedious\\" for the acting and staging. Barnes wrote, \\"The writing has a fake Oriental archness to it—a solemnity, at times a pomposity. Yet the ideas are fresh. [...] Narrow Road to the Deep North is far better play than it would appear to be from its Lincoln Center production. But on just how much better I will for the moment hold my peace.\\" Ann Marie Demling noted that it is one of the Bond plays to which \\"awards and citations of excellence have been given\\" along with Saved (1965), Lear (1971), Bingo (1973) and The Fool (1975). Richard Stayton of Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Bond’s metaphor for the Vietnam War unfortunately travels neatly into the 1990s as a mirror to such tragedies as Bosnia\\", but panned the performance he had seen (which was by The Actors' Gang). Gerry Colgan of The Irish Times wrote in 2001 that while Bond's works were not generally well-known in Ireland, Narrow Road to the Deep North was a play that had \\"[resonated] down the years\\" along with Saved (1965). Michael Mangan described it as one of Bond's \\"major plays\\" in a 2018 book on the dramatist. Academic Amer Hamed Suliman dubbed it \\"one of Edward Bond's most significant works\\" in 2019.

The text of the first installment of Wagner the Wehr-Wolf begins at the bottom of the page. George William MacArthur Reynolds (23 July 1814 – 19 June 1879) was a British fiction writer and journalist. Reynolds was born in Sandwich, Kent, the son of Captain Sir George Reynolds, a flag officer of the Royal Navy. Reynolds was educated first at Dr. Nance's school in Ashford, Kent, and then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was intended for a career in the British Army, but his parents died during 1829 and, with his subsequent inheritance, he decided to quit the military and devote himself instead to literary pursuits. He left Sandhurst on 13 September 1830 and for the next few years he traveled a great deal, particularly in France, and became a naturalised French citizen.\\"The Other Dickens\\", aired on BBC Radio 3, 1 July 2012 He began residence in Paris in 1834, where he started a daily English newspaper. The venture failed, and Reynolds returned bankrupt to England in 1836. Reynolds served as editor of The Teetotaler (a weekly journal advocating teetotalism) beginning in 1840. Novels Reynolds was a prolific writer of popular fiction starting from The Youthful Imposter, published in 1835 which was then republished later as The Parricide; or, The Youth's Career of Crime. After the publication of his first novel Reynolds then assumed the editorship of The Monthly Magazine, a position which he held between 1837 and 1838 and wrote articles under the pseudonym of \\"Parisianus.\\" Almost forgotten now, during his lifetime he was more read than Dickens or Thackeray; in his obituary, the trade magazine The Bookseller called Reynolds \\"the most popular writer of our times\\" (\\"Obituary\\" 600). His best-known work was the long-running serial The Mysteries of London (1844), which borrowed liberally in concept from Eugène Sue's Les Mystères de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris). It sold 40,000 copies a week in penny instalments and more than a million copies cumulatively before it was issued in bound volumes, enjoying an international circulation in French, German, Italian, and Spanish translations. Although it was outlawed by the authorities, the German version achieved the status of a cult favourite on the Russian black market. The Mysteries of London and its even lengthier sequel, The Mysteries of the Court of London, are considered to be among the seminal works of the Victorian \\"urban mysteries\\" genre, a style of sensational fiction which adapted elements of Gothic novels – with their haunted castles, innocent noble damsels in distress and nefarious villains – to produce stories which instead emphasized the poverty, crime, and violence of a great metropolis, complete with detailed and often sympathetic descriptions of the lives of lower-class lawbreakers and extensive glossaries of thieves' cant, all interwoven with a frank sexuality not usually found in popular fiction of the time. An illustration from The Mysteries of London The Mysteries of London, like most of Reynolds' works, was published first as a weekly penny dreadful, or \\"Penny Blood\\", illustrated with lurid engravings and circulating mainly among readers of limited means and education. Although Reynolds was unusual in his religious skepticism (one of the main characters in The Mysteries of London was a clergyman turned libertine) and political radicalism, his tales were intended for his mostly middle- and lower-class readers; they featured \\"hump-backed dwarves, harridans and grave-robbers [who] groped past against a background of workhouses, jails, execution yards, thieves' kitchens and cemeteries. His readers could depend on him to bring in the theme of maiden virtue rudely strumpeted as often as possible.\\" Reynolds' Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was a gothic novel which described how the title character became a werewolf after making a pact with the devil.Fisher, B. F.; \\"Wagner, the Wehr-Wulf\\", in: Frank N. Magill, ed. Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 4. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp. 2049–53) . Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf was republished in 1975 by Dover Books with an introduction and bibliography of Reynolds by E. F. Bleiler. Reynold's novels remained in print on both sides of the Atlantic longer than those of many of his contemporaries. An 1875 edition of Reynolds's Ciprina, published in Philadelphia, lists 40 novels including Mysteries of London under the heading \\"George W. M. Reynolds' Great Works\\", priced between 50 cents and $1.00. The Mysteries of the Court of London, translated into Marathi as well as Urdu, remained a best-seller in India well into the twentieth century. The Marathi translation was done by K.B. Mande in the early 20th century and was titled The Secret Deeds of the Elites of London. It was very popular in the Marathi-speaking area, as is evident by numerous references to the text in early 20th-century Marathi literature. The first issue of The Mysteries of the Court of London (1849-56) Chartism Reynolds was also a major figure in the Chartist movement. In 1846, he founded two magazines, Reynolds' Miscellany (RM) and The London Journal (LJ). In 1849, he founded Reynolds's Political Instructor, which in May 1850 became Reynolds Weekly Newspaper, the leading radical newspaper of the post-Chartist era. It long survived him, ending publication in 1967 as the Sunday Citizen. For both Reynolds's Political Instructor and Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, between 1849 and 1856, he would write a signed editorial every week in which he gave his opinion on the pressing political matters of the day. In 1854, he relocated to Herne Bay in Kent, where he became one of the town's Improvement Commissioners. Reynolds was an advocate of British Republicanism; much of his journalism, especially during the 1870s, \\"promoted a levelling agenda against traditional social hierarchies and accentuated the difficulties of the British throne\\".Andrzej Olechnowicz, The Monarchy and the British Nation, 1780 to the Present. Cambridge University Press, 2007. , (p. 190). Novels A prolific novelist, the list of Reynolds's works is long; matters are made more complex by the fact that American publishers often attributed the authorship of various anonymously written books to Reynolds as well. Furthermore, although he is known as a penny blood author, not all of his works appeared as serialised penny instalments. The following works have, as a result of research by E.F. Bleiler, been confirmed to have been definitely authored by Reynolds: * The Youthful Imposter ** (published in 3 vols by Librarie des Estrangers in 1835) * The Baroness: A Novel ** (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1837, under the pseudonym of \\"Parisianus\\") * Pickwick Abroad; or, The Tour in France ** (serialised in the Monthly Magazine between 1837-38) * Alfred de Rosann ** (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838). * The Father ** (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838). * Mary Hamel ** (serialised in the Monthly Magazine in 1838). * The Appointment: A Tale ** (serialised in The Isis in 1839). * Grace Darling; or, the Heroine of the Ferne Islands ** (published in one volume by George Henderson in 1839). * Robert Macaire in England ** (published in 3 vols by Thomas Tegg in 1839). * Noctes Pickwickianae ** (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840). * The Steam Packet: A Tale of the River and Ocean ** (published in one volume by Willoughby in 1840). * The Drunkard's Tale ** (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1840). * Pickwick Married ** (serialised in The Teetotaller in 1841). * Master Timothy's Bookcase ** (issued in weekly parts beginning July 15, 1841 and published as a single volume by W.

Poetry  * A Sequel to Don Juan (London: Paget and Co., 1843)  Alternative Titles  Alternative American Titles (alphabetical): Many of Reynolds's novels were published under different titles by publishers in the USA, and they were rarely serialized as they were in the UK. Sometimes Reynolds was not even credited for his novels. The details of the alternative titles are as follows. Most of these American editions were published by Philadelphia-based T.B. Peterson or the New York-based Hurst and Co. * The Bronze Statue ** American title: Angela Wildon; or, the Mysteries of Altendorph Castle * Canonbury House ** American title (i): The Mysteries of the Court of Queen Elizabeth ** American title (ii): Ada Arundel; or, The Secret Corridor ** American title (iii): Olivia; or, The Maid of Honour. * Mary Price; or, The Memoirs of a Servant girl ** published as two different volumes in New York: Mary Price (vol. 1) and Eustace Quentin (vol. 2) * The Massacre of Glencoe ** American title: Roderick the Brave; or, the Massacre of Glencoe. * The Necromancer ** American title: Musidora; or, The Necromancer * The Seamstress ** American title: Virginia Mordaunt, the Seamstress ** Alternative American title: The Palace of Infamy * The Soldier's Wife ** American title: The Degraded Deserter * Omar ** American title (i): Omar Pasha; or The Vizier's Daughter ** American title (ii): Catherine Volmar; or, A Father's Revenge ** American title (iii): The White Lady: A Romance of Love and War * Leila; or The Star of Minghella ** American title (i): Leila ** American title (ii): Karaman; or, The Bandit Chief * The Empress Eugenie's Boudoir ** American title: The Mysteries of the Court of France  American Reprints of Mysteries of the Court of London  In the United States Reynolds's Mysteries of the Court of London was published as The Works of G.W.M. Reynolds, 20 vols (Boston: Burton Ethnological Society, 1900). This work was not a collection of Reynolds's whole corpus of works but merely a reprint of Series 1-4 of The Mysteries of the Court of London. These 20 volumes were then privately reprinted c.1920 by a Boston-based \\"Oxford Society\\". Each volume was given a different title: * First series: Vol. 1: Pauline Clarendon; Vol. 2: Rose Foster (a); Vol. 3: Rose Foster (b); Vol. 4: Mrs. Fitzherbert; Vol. 5: Caroline Walters * Second series: Vols. 6-10: Venetia Trelawney * Third series: Vols 11-15: Lady Saxondale's Crimes * Fourth Series: Vols. 16-20: The Fortunes of the Ashtons.  Spurious Works and Mis- attributions  Given Reynolds's fame in the USA the publisher T.B. Peterson regularly attached Reynolds's name to novels that he never wrote.

It is a branch of the common interosseous artery. Course It passes down the forearm on the palmar surface of the interosseous membrane. It is accompanied by the palmar interosseous branch of the median nerve, and overlapped by the contiguous margins of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles, giving off in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient arteries of the radius and ulna. At the upper border of the pronator quadratus muscle it pierces the interosseous membrane and reaches the back of the forearm, where it anastomoses with the dorsal interosseous artery. It then descends, in company with the terminal portion of the dorsal interosseous nerve, to the back of the wrist to join the dorsal carpal network. The anterior interosseous artery may give off a slender branch, the median artery, which accompanies the median nerve, and gives offsets to its substance; this artery is sometimes much enlarged, and runs with the nerve into the palm of the hand. Before it pierces the interosseous membrane the anterior interosseous sends a branch downward behind the pronator quadratus muscle to join the palmar carpal network. Function The anterior interosseous artery supplies the deep layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm, including the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus muscles.

It is the smallest branch of the external carotid and is a long, slender vessel, deeply seated in the neck, beneath the other branches of the external carotid and under the stylopharyngeus muscle. It lies just superior to the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries. The artery most typically bifurcates into embryologically distinct pharyngeal and neuromeningeal trunks. The pharyngeal trunk usually consists of several branches which supply the middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles and the stylopharyngeus, ramifying in their substance and in the mucous membranes lining them. These branches are in hemodynamic equilibrium with contributors from the internal maxillary artery. The neuromeningeal trunk classically consists of jugular and hypoglossal divisions, which enter the jugular and hypoglossal foramina to supply regional meningeal and neural structures, being in equilibrium with branches of the vertebral, occipital, posterior meningeal, middle meningeal, and internal carotid arteries (via its caroticotympanic branch, meningohypophyseal, and inferolateral trunks). Also present is the inferior tympanic branch, which ascends towards the middle ear cavity; it is involved in internal carotid artery reconstitution via the \\"aberrant carotid artery\\" variant. The muscular branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery is in equilibrium with the odontoid arcade from the vertebral artery. Course It arises from the back part of the external carotid, near the commencement of that vessel, and ascends vertically between the internal carotid and the side of the pharynx, to the under surface of the base of the skull, lying on the longus capitis.

However, in some individuals the contribution from the radial artery might be absent, and instead anastomoses with either the princeps pollicis artery, the radialis indicis artery, or the median artery, the former two of which are branches from the radial artery. Alternative names for this arterial arch are: superficial volar arch,Palmar and volar may be used synonymously, but volar is less common. superficial ulnar arch, arcus palmaris superficialis,This is the official and international Latin term as defined by the Terminologia Anatomica (TA), but in English speaking countries and especially the US, superficial palmar arch is more commonly used. or arcus volaris superficialis.Again, palmar and volar may be used synonymously, but arcus volaris superficialis does not occur in the TA, and can therefore be considered deprecated. The arch passes across the palm in a curve (Boeckel's line) with its convexity downward, If one were to fully extend the thumb, the superficial palmar arch would lie approximately 1 cm distal from a line drawn between the first web space to the Hook of Hamate (Kaplan's Cardinal Line). The superficial palmar arch extends more distally than the deep palmar arch. The connection between the deep and superficial palmar arterial arches is an example of anastomosis, and can be tested for using Allen's test. Three common palmar digital arteries arise from the arch, proceeding down on the second, third, and fourth lumbrical muscles, respectively. They each receive a contribution from a palmar metacarpal artery. Near the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints, each common palmar digital artery divides into two proper palmar digital arteries. Four digital branches arise from this palmar arch that supplies the medial/ulnar 3 1/2 fingers.

It provided live network sports coverage until the end of the 2016-17 Western Hockey League season. In terms of network coverage, Shaw was in a partnership with the Western Hockey League from 2003-04 through 2016-17 to all subscribers across the network in Western Canada known as WHL on SHAW. The schedule usually consisted of random games before the December holiday break, with a regular game of the week on Friday nights plus select Saturday and mid week games. In the playoffs, Shaw will select one series per round to cover. Play-by-play broadcasters for the 2012–13 season include Dan Russell and Peter Loubardias. Russell is in his ninth year as play-by-play announcer. Bill Wilms and Jeff Odgers provide colour commentary, with Andy Neal responsible for hosting duties. In 2006, Shaw added Canada West Football as a sports property with a game of the week package known as Krown Produce Canada West Football on Shaw. Shaw carried the Hardy Cup Championship until 2011, when the conference elected to broadcast the game on TSN. The Hardy returned to Shaw from 2013 - 2016. The Shaw TV production produced and presented the Hardy to 10.2 million households in the 2015 season on Global TV nationally. Jim Mullin was responsible for the play- by-play broadcast duties from 2006 until the series end in 2016. Colour announcers included former Saskatchewan Huskies quarterback Laurence Nixon, former Hec Crighton Trophy winner and Canadian Football League running back Jesse Lumsden, Saskatoon-based broadcaster Wray Morrison, Krown Countdown U analyst Gord Randall and former CFL player Daved Benefield. Andy Neal handled the hosting duties. It was announced before the start of the 2012 season that Canada West had renewed their agreement with Shaw for another three seasons. In 2009, Shaw broadcast provincial curling championships for men and women in Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. In 2013, Rogers Sportsnet obtained the rights for Manitoba's and Alberta's playdowns. It was announced by Curl BC prior to Shaw's coverage in 2013 that the broadcast rights for BC will move to Sportsnet for 2014. In 2012, Shaw broadcast the CIS Final Eight Women's Basketball Championship a.k.a. The Bronze Baby from the University of Calgary and shared the feed with NBA TV Canada. All of Shaw TV's network sports coverage ceased with the CRTC-approved closure of the Shaw TV channels in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. Controversies Some concern has been raised about the company putting business interests over public- access/community interests, and has led one community group to consider creating an alternative, independent local public-access service in Vancouver.

The players are professionals and play for the provinces in which they reside. All of the provinces in Cuba are represented by teams. Organization of Cuban national baseball system Cuban National Series The National Series generally runs from November through March with a schedule of 96 games per team in the regular season. The series is then followed by 3 playoff rounds culminating in a championship. This series has been played each winter since 1961-62. There are 16 teams organized in a West League and an East League. The top four teams from each league advance to a playoff, with the winner crowned in March, which then goes to the Caribbean Series as the Cuban delegate. Two teams have dominated the National Series in recent years: Industriales and Santiago de Cuba. Super Series The Super Series is usually played from May through July with a schedule of about 28 games. The series is followed by a playoff between the two top teams. Its teams are selected from the best players of the National Series. In turn, the Cuban national team is selected from the players in the Super Series. Five regional teams compete: *Occidentales (Western region) *Havana *Centrales (Central region) *Orientales (Eastern region) *Santiago de Cuba History of the Cuban national baseball system Prior to the Cuban Revolution, various professional, semiprofessional, industrial, and amateur baseball leagues and teams flourished in Cuba, including the professional Cuban League and the minor league Havana Sugar Kings. Since the Cuban Revolution, baseball continued to thrive as Cuba's national game. In February 1961 the government created the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER) and in March, after the close of the 1960–61 Cuban League season, it decreed the abolition of professional baseball and plans to hold a national amateur championship. The first National Series, 1961–62, included four teams: Occidentales, Orientales, Habana, and Azucareros. The next season the number of teams had increased to six, and in 1967 to 12. The expansion of baseball to the provinces was accompanied by the construction of new stadiums in provincial capitals, bringing first-tier baseball to the provincial population. This expansion greatly enhanced the nationwide accessibility of top-flight baseball. The two new Havana-based teams, Industriales and Habana (renamed in the 1970s to Metropolitanos), were similar to the old professional Cuban League rivals, Almendares and Habana in that Industriales, like Almendares, wore blue, while Habana/Metropolitanos, like Habana, wore red. However, after Industriales went on to capture four consecutive championships from 1963–66, they became known as the premier Cuban team. Metropolitanos after the '80s, on the other hand, was unable to be competitive and has failed to re-establish the rivalry; it is now considered a second-class team, where young players and fading veterans share playing time. Several individuals were important in the transition to post-revolutionary baseball. Gilberto Torres managed the early national team and conveyed his vast knowledge of the game to the new generation of amateur players. Natilla Jiménez managed several provincial teams and was pitching coach of the national team. Juan Vistuer, Asdrúbal Baró, and Pedro Chávez also were prominent transitional coaches and managers. Conrado Marrero (former pitcher with the Washington Senators) remained in Cuba where he was a pitching coach for several teams. The Cuban baseball system is designed as much to develop the nation's athletic talents as to provide entertainment to the public. Children showing athletic promise are sent to sports academies for extensive competitive training and development, with the goal of developing the nation's athletes. Some players are able to make the municipal team and advance through the sport without training in the academies, but those players are exceptional. Although players are amateurs, elite players are subsidized and given special rewards. A problem confronting Cuba's top athletes, however, is the lack of opportunities to compete against the best players in the world. An opportunity for competition against the world's best professional players was finally made available by the World Baseball Classic first held in March . Some other memorable events in the history of the Cuban national baseball system are the following: *On 16 January and 25 January 1966, right-hander Aquino Abreu pitched back-to-back no-hitters (against Occidentals and Industriales), matching a feat accomplished by major-leaguer Johnny Vander Meer. *On 13 August 1966 José Ramón López established an all-time season record of 309 strikeouts. Although López struck out 12 batters, he lost the game 2–0. * On 12 April 1980, two players from the same team, Rey Vicente Anglada and Jorge Beltrán of Habana, hit grand slams in one inning. Remarkably, on the same day major leaguers Cecil Cooper and Don Money of the Milwaukee Brewers accomplished the same feat. *In 1985 Lázaro Vargas of Industriales set the Cuban National Series record for consecutive-game hitting streak by hitting safely in 31 straight games. *In 1990 all-time Cuban great Omar Linares hit better than .400 for the third time to win his third batting title. Linares is widely considered to be one of the greatest third basemen of all time. *In March 1994 Lázaro Junco wins his eighth home run title. Junco retired with the career record of 405 home runs (later surpassed by Orestes Kindelán). *On 28 March 1999 the Baltimore Orioles are the first Major League team in 40 years to play in Cuba, playing against the Cuban national team before 55,000 fans in Latin American Stadium in Havana. In 2019, the Under-23 division of the Cuban National Series began its debut season, with its players being below 23 years of age. Emigrants A number of immigrants from Cuba (sometimes described as \\"defectors\\") have played for the major leagues. Immediately after the Cuban Revolution many of the former professional baseball players emigrated, but for the next 30 years relatively few left Cuba. Since 1991, however, a number of prominent Cuban baseball players have emigrated.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 to 1952 and again from 1959 to 1971 as a member of the Social Credit Party. Early life Tomyn taught in a one-room school house in Plain Lake, Alberta. Political career Tomyn ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature under the Social Credit banner in the 1935 Alberta general election, in the electoral district of Whitford. He defeated three other candidates, including incumbent Isidore Goresky and former MLA Andrew Shandro. The district of Whitford was later abolished in redistribution in 1940. Tomyn ran in the new electoral district of Willingdon in the election held that year and won with a large majority. Tomyn ran for a third term in the 1944 Alberta general election. He defeated Co-operative Commonwealth candidate L.L. Kostash on the second count to hold his seat. Tomyn ran for a fourth term in the 1948 Alberta general election. He defeated Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate Nick Dushenski by 250 votes. Tomyn faced Dushenski again in the 1952 election and was defeated in a close race on the second count. Tomyn attempted a comeback as the Social Credit candidate in the new electoral district of Edmonton Norwood in the 1959 general election. He defeated four other candidates in a landslide. He thus became one of the few persons to have held both urban and rural districts in the Alberta legislature. In the 1963 Alberta general election, Tomyn's share of the popular vote was significantly reduced since the last election but he was still returned with a comfortable majority. In the 1967 general election, Tomyn faced NDP candidate and future MLA Grant Notley, whom he defeated by a margin of 1,000 votes. Tomyn retired from the Alberta Legislature at dissolution in 1971. The length of his service made him the sixth longest-serving member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to date.

It is located near Upper Mississippi Mile Marker 483, adjacent to the Mississippi River Lock and Dam No. 15. The current structure (which was completed in 1896) is the fourth at this location, and includes a swing section to accommodate traffic navigating the locks. The double-rail track above the road level is unusual for a bridge. The original bridge, which was finished in 1856, was the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi. The bridge was long, and the draw-span was . It was a threat to the South (which sought to create a southern rail route to the Pacific) and to St. Louis, whose steamboats faced competition from Chicago's railroads.Tweet, Roald D. The Quad Cities: An American mosaic. East Hall Press. 1996. The Effie Afton struck the bridge weeks after it opened, and steamboat companies brought lawsuits. It was replaced in 1866 by a wooden structure. In 1868, the second bridge was damaged by an ice storm and a tornado; however, construction crews repaired and reopened the bridge. It was replaced in 1872 by a twin double-deck bridge. The third bridge, long, was near the Rock Island shore. During the 1880s, the bridge accommodated horse- drawn trolley cars; electric trolleys ran on the current bridge until 1940. History First bridge The first bridge, constructed in the 1850s and located about upstream of the present bridge, was the first railroad bridge to span the Mississippi River. It played a prominent role in the period before the American Civil War and construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The bridge connected the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad with the newly-created Mississippi and Missouri Railroad, proposed by Thomas C. Durant as Iowa's first railroad (linking Davenport and Council Bluffs). Companies operating steamships on the Mississippi opposed the bridge, fearing that it would pose a navigation hazard and alter their monopoly on trade. The bridge opened on April 22, 1856.  Description  ++The Surveying party for laying the bridge was led by Col Robert E. Lee American Ride Season 2 Episode 7The total of the bridge was long, and it’s draw-span was long. The bridge was built by utilizing timber and iron, which rested on granite piers. The draw- span allowed an opening of on both sides to let steamboats pass through. The lower deck of the bridge, which was above water, was used for wagons while the upper deck was used for railway traffic.  Post-completion history  Since the bridge crossed the island which used to be the home of Fort Armstrong, the Department of War had a say in its construction. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and President Franklin Pierce initially approved the bridge; thinking that the transcontinental railroad would go through the South to Los Angeles. He later changed his mind as resistance to that plan began to surface, fearing that the transcontinental railroad would now take a northern route. Davis ordered the construction halted, but he was ignored.  Effie Afton collision  On May 6, 1856, the steamer Effie Afton collided with the bridge after one of its paddles stopped. The crew were rescued, but the steamer caught fire, damaged the bridge, and sank. Steamboat companies sued to have the bridge dismantled. The Mississippi and Missouri Railroad (M&M;) and the Rock Island Line hired Abraham Lincoln to defend the bridge, and the case worked its way to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the M&M; and Rock Island merged to become the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.A Brief Historical Overview of the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railroad At the time of the collision, the bridge was built in a difficult part of the rapids, and its draw-span was at an angle to the current (making the bridge hard for steamboats to clear). Many felt that the bridge had been designed to interfere with steamboat traffic. Durant took his earnings from the M&M; merger to form the Union Pacific Railroad. Lincoln, as part of his research as an attorney, visited M&M; facilities and met with M&M; officials in Council Bluffs. When the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 gave him the power to choose the eastern terminus of the transcontinental railroad, he picked a location favorable to his former clients. The case trial ended in a hung jury, and was dismissed; the Supreme Court ruled on a subsequent suit on December 18, 1862, and the bridge remained operational. Second bridge The first bridge only lasted until 1866, when it was considered inadequate for the ever-increasing loads carried by the railroad. It was replaced by a heavier wooden structure, which reused the original piers. All that remains of the first bridge is an elevated approach west of River Drive on the Iowa side, and a reconstructed pier on Arsenal Island. The second bridge had two decks: a lower deck for pedestrians and an upper deck for railroad traffic. In 1868, an ice storm damaged the bridge's piers and timber spans. Later that year, a tornado also severely damaged the bridge; however, construction crews from Chicago were able to reopen it. Third bridge left The wooden structure was replaced by an iron, twin double-deck bridge in 1872 which carried a single-track rail line and a roadway. This bridge was at a new location on the western tip of Arsenal Island, and the original bridge and rail line were abandoned. The relocation was driven by the federal government, which still owned the island and wished to redevelop it as an arsenal. The original bridge and rail line divided the property in two, and the development constraint was removed by moving the bridge to one end of the island. The federal government used this bridge for access to the railroad, giving rise to its name. The railways used the upper deck, and wagons, livestock and pedestrians used the lower deck. This bridge was long, and was located near the Rock Island shore. During the 1880s, it accommodated horse-drawn trolley cars and electric trolleys; this tradition was continued on the fourth bridge until 1940. Present bridge Sidewalk view during a swing-span opening The current Government Bridge, the fourth crossing of the Mississippi in the area, was built in 1896 at the same location and used the same piers as the 1872 structure. A twin double-deck bridge which carries rail (top level) and road traffic (bottom level), it has two train tracks to eliminate what had become a rail-traffic bottleneck. The bridge was designed by Ralph Modjeski and built by the Phoenix Bridge Company, and was the first bridge designed by Modjeski. On March 2, 1895, Congress authorized the War Department to build the new bridge. A 2006 stress test indicated that the bridge used only \\"10 to 12 percent\\" of its service life, and was listed as part of a proposed rail trail. In 1956, a steam-powered train was brought to the Quad Cities to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first bridge's completion. The train pulled dining cars that included dignitaries from Rock Island to Davenport. On February 22, 2006 (50 years later), a dinner was held at RiverCenter to mark the 150th anniversary of the bridge. The dinner re-enacted a similar event that was held on February 22, 1854, which celebrated the completion of the Rock Island railroad. During that year, the Quad Cities again celebrated the 150th anniversary of the bridge completion from Thursday September 14th to Sunday September 17th in a festival that included \\"steam locomotive excursions, riverboat rides, canoe and kayak races, a story-telling festival and a unique “ghost bridge” display\\". In 1965, the bridge closed after flooding occurred at the Davenport approach. On May 2, 2019, the bridge and several others in the Quad Cities region were closed to all traffic due to severe flooding of the Mississippi and Rock Rivers and a levee breach in Davenport. The bridge was reopened on May 8.Government Bridge, Rock Island Viaduct reopens . Quad City Times , May 8, 2019 On July 10, 2019, the bridge closed for a day after a train derailed.

The magazine was headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. History and profile In its ten-year history, Deathrealm featured hundreds of stories by writers ranging from talented first-timers to the best-known professionals in the horror field. Some of the authors whose work appeared in the magazine include Gary Braunbeck, Fred Chappell, Douglas Clegg, Mary Elizabeth Counselman, Charlee Jacob, Joe R. Lansdale, Elizabeth Massie, Rex Miller, William F. Nolan, Jeffrey Osier, Tom Piccirilli, Jessica Amanda Salmonson, William R. Trotter, Manly Wade Wellman, J. N. Williamson, David Niall Wilson, W. H. Pugmire and many others. Deathrealm was best known for its high-quality fiction and stunning artwork. One cover illustration by artist Ian McDowell (issue 27), which featured an Adobe Photoshop-altered image of the artist as a baby, was considered too controversial by Canadian censors, who banned the sale of that issue. The final issue (#31, Summer 1997) featured a cover by renowned artist Richard Corben. Though Rainey edited the magazine for its entire run, Deathrealm had the following three publishers: issues 1 through 17—Stephen Mark Rainey (independent publisher); issues 18 through 22 -- Tal Publications; issues 23 through 31 -- Malicious Press (a partnership of screenwriter Terry Rossio and novelist Lawrence Watt-Evans). The first 14 issues of Deathrealm were digest- sized (5.5\\" x 8.5\\"), but as of issue 15, the editor opted to change the format to full magazine size (8.5\\" x 11\\") to increase newsstand circulation. It continued in this format until the end of its run. Deathrealm won several awards, including the Small Press Writers and Artists Organization's Best Magazine/Editor Award of 1990, the Small Press Genre Association's Best Magazine/Editor Award of 1994, and the International Horror Critics Guild Award for Best Publication of 1995. Numerous stories from the magazine were selected for DAW Books' Year's Best Horror anthology, edited by Karl Edward Wagner, and St. Martin's Press' Year's Best Fantasy and Horror edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling. In 2004, Rainey compiled an anthology of stories from the magazine, titled Deathrealms, which was published as a signed and limited edition hardcover by Delirium Books.

Structure  It is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which most commonly arises from the common hepatic artery of the celiac trunk, although there are numerous variations of the origin of the gastroduodenal artery. The pancreaticoduodenal artery divides into two branches as it descends, an anterior and posterior branch. These branches then travel around the head of the pancreas and duodenum, eventually joining with the anterior and posterior branches of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. These arteries, together with the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery, form connections or anastomoses with one another, allowing blood to perfuse the pancreas and duodenum through multiple channels. The artery supplies the anterior and posterior sides of the duodenum and head of pancreas, with the anterior branch supply the anterior surface and similarly for the posterior. At 42 letters, the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is also the artery with the longest name in the human body.

The station is owned by Dunes 102 FM, LLC. History Shortly after the station was licensed (as WTUR in 1988 and later WCDJ in 1992), the original owners, Truro Wireless, Inc., ran into opposition from the Truro local government, who objected to a radio tower being built within the town limits. Until such a tower was built, the station could not air a regular broadcast schedule. In lieu of a tower, WCDJ would occasionally broadcast just long enough, via a small transmitter, at 340 watts, to keep their FCC license intact. The first of these limited broadcasts occurred in August 1999. On March 29, 2007, the FCC granted a transfer of the WCDJ license to Dunes 102FM LLC. The new owners got the call letters changed to WGTX, and began full broadcast service as \\"Dunes 102: Cape Cod's Oldies Radio\\" on August 5, 2007. In 2012, the station dropped the \\"Oldies\\" moniker from their branding, re- branding themselves as \\"Cape Cod's 102.3, The Dunes\\", in light of the format- wide re-branding of 'oldies' stations.

It is usually formed mainly from the terminal part of the radial artery, with the ulnar artery contributing via its deep palmar branch, by an anastomosis. This is in contrast to the superficial palmar arch, which is formed predominantly by the ulnar artery. The deep palmar arch lies upon the bases of the metacarpal bones and on the interossei of the hand, being covered by the oblique head of the adductor pollicis muscle, the flexor tendons of the fingers, and the lumbricals of the hand. Alongside of it, but running in the opposite direction—toward the radial side of the hand—is the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The superficial palmar arch is more distally located than the deep palmar arch. If one were to fully extend the thumb and draw a line from the distal border of the thumb across the palm, this would be the level of the superficial palmar arch (Boeckel's line). The deep palmar arch is about a finger width proximal to this. The connection between the deep and superficial palmar arterial arches is an example of anastomosis, and can be tested for using Allen's test. From the deep palmar arch emerge palmar metacarpal arteries.

Description Iva annua is an annual herb up to 150 cm (5 feet) tall. The plant produces many small flower heads in a narrow, elongated, spike-like array, each head with 11–17 disc florets but no ray florets.Flora of North America, Iva annua Linnaeus, 1753. Distribution It is native to northeastern Mexico (Tamaulipas) and to the central and southern United States, primarily the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley as far north as North Dakota. There are some populations in the eastern US, but these appear to represent introductions.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Uses Iva annua was cultivated for its edible seed by Native Americans around 4,000 years ago in the central and eastern United States as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. It was especially important to the indigenous peoples of the Kansas City Hopewell culture in present-day Missouri and Illinois. The edible parts contain 32 percent protein and 45 percent oil. However, like its relative ragweed, sumpweed possesses many objectionable qualities which include being a severe potential allergen and possessing a disagreeable odor. Probably for these reasons it was abandoned once more pleasant alternatives (such as maize) were available, and by the time Europeans arrived in the Americas, had long disappeared as a crop.

The bridge is a truss bridge with a swing span crossing the main river channel and is adjacent to the Gateway Bridge. The original bridge was constructed in 1858, and the first train crossed the bridge on January 19, 1860. The bridge was the second railroad crossing over the Mississippi River, and the first over the Upper Mississippi. In 1870, the bridge was declared a post route, therefore stopping the occupation of steamboats and approval of railroads. From 1859 to 1908, the mileage in operation increased from 28,789 to 229,230, prompting the Chicago and North Western Railroad to replace the bridge with a new structure in 1900. The current bridge was built by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. Construction of the new bridge was planned in 1901, and on February 7, 1907, Congress authorized its construction. Construction of the bridge ended in 1907, and the bridge opened in 1909. During that year, the first train crossed the new bridge, and the old bridge was taken down. There are still piers from predecessor bridges next to the current bridge. Through its purchase of Chicago and North Western Railway in 1995, Union Pacific Railroad is the current owner of the bridge. There are possibilities that the current bridge would be replaced. The bridge was listed as “hazard to navigation” by United States Coast Guard in 1996 and by the Iowa Department of Transportation in 2009. In preparation of a replacement bridge, a new depot was purchased in 2017 and new land were purchased in 2018. However, it is unknown as to when construction for the new bridge would happen.  Description  The swing span of the Clinton Railroad Bridge in 2018. The Clinton Railroad Bridge is a two- tracked swing Parker truss bridge with a swing span and a overall length of . This bridge contains four spans: a swing span, a deck girder span, a Parker through truss span, and a quadrangular truss span. The bridge's vertical clearance is , and has estimate of above ground. At the end of the swing span is a Warren-style truss configuration, and the tower portion of the bridge has a very narrow appearance.  History  Original bridge (1864–1909) Planning In 1835, a former riverboat pilot, Elijah Buell, along with his business partner, John Baker, located a ferry service at a place north of the current bridge location called \\"the Narrows.\\" Baker established himself on the Illinois side of the river, and Buell settled on the Iowa side. Baker's settlement eventually became the City of Fulton, Illinois. Buell's settlement was chartered by Buell and three partners (George Harlan, Dennis Warren, and Chalkey Hoag) in 1837 as Lyons, Iowa, named for the city of the same name in France. Because of the popularity of the river ferry, both Fulton and Lyons grew very rapidly. In 1852, citizens of Lyons learnt that a new railroad would be built westward of Iowa, which led to possibilities of a Mississippi River railroad crossing between Lyons and Fulton. The Iowa Land Company was organized in 1855 with the announcement that a railroad crossing was to be attempted south of Lyons and Fulton. The land company bought Bartlett's holdings on the Iowa side of the river and re-platted them under the name Clinton, Iowa, in honor of the Governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton. The Chicago, Iowa, and Nebraska (C&IN;) Railroad Company was formed to effect the railroad crossing at Little Rock Island, between the new city of Clinton and the village of Albany, Illinois. However, C&IN; went bankrupt in 1862, and was later purchased by the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad. Construction Stereoscope of the old bridge In 1858, Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railroad began construction of the bridge. On January 15, 1859, the first piers for the bridge was driven and on December 14 that year, the last span was dropped. The first railroad bridge at Clinton was declared open for operation at noon on January 19, 1860, as the first train crossed the bridge. It would be the second railway crossing over the entire Mississippi River, and the first on the Upper Mississippi. However, the entire span was not yet complete, and railway cars had to be ferried across the main channel of the river between Little Rock Island and the Iowa shoreline. The final segment of the original span was completed in 1864, the same year that the C&IN; merged with the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad to form the Chicago and North Western (C&NW;) Railroad. This company operated the bridge, and its successor, the current bridge, constructed in 1907, until the Union Pacific Railway Company purchased the C&NW; in 1995. The bridge was completed on January 6, 1865 and the first Chicago freight train crossed it six days later. The bridge's total length was , and its draw span was long. From the beginning of its construction, the Clinton Railroad Bridge was the subject of several lawsuits brought by river steamboat operators. In 1870, a third lawsuit was settled by the United States Supreme Court in favor of the railroad. The bridge was declared a post route, therefore stopping the occupation of steamboats and approval of railroads. The mileage in operation increased from 28,789 in 1859 to 229,230 in 1908, with more than 150 trains using the bridge on some days, prompted the Chicago and North Western Railroad to replace the bridge with a new structure in 1900. The old bridge was torn down in 1909. Current bridge (1907–present) Planning for construction on the new bridge began in 1901. On February 6, 1907, Congress authorized construction of the new bridge. On May 4 of that year, the secretary of war approved plans for it. During the time of construction, the draw span was one of the largest spans on the Mississippi Rver. On March 21, 1907, a formal order authorized the necessary expenditures for the bridge. On May 18, 1907, a contract for the entire sub-structure was entered, which was made for erection of the slough spans and east channel spans. In February 1908, a contract for constructing the west channel spans was made. The new bridge opened in 1909, and in late winter during that year, the first train crossed the bridge. The cost for the new bridge was $1 millions dollars. In October 1958, the bridge caught on fire and suffered $250,000 in loss. In June 1959, the bridge suffered another fire, but the damage was slight. The cause of the blaze was not determined, but firefighters said that 25 ties were damaged by heat and would need to be replaced. On August 7, 2007, eleven coal cars derailed on the bridge. The train was traveling from Wyoming to Illinois. The bridge reopened on Wednesday August 8, 2007. Future replacement There has been possibilities that the current Clinton Railroad Bridge may be replaced. In 1996, the United States Coast Guard listed the bridge as a \\"hazard to navigation\\", and this declaration helped put the bridge on track for replacement once federal funds would be available to do it. During that year, the Coast Guard issued an order to \\"alter the bridge\\" to the Union Pacific and cited it as an \\"unreasonable obstruction to navigation\\". In a 2009 report, the Iowa Department of Transportation described the bridge as a \\"persistent hazard to navigation that causes a significant loss of America's economic competitiveness due to delays it creates\\". In 2013, Union Pacific planned to build a new $400 million span bridge to replace the current one. In 2017, Union Pacific purchased a depot in preparation for a new railroad bridge. In 2018, Union Pacific purchased new land near the Garden Plain Township in Illinois.

He took energetic measures to secure Cairo and St. Louis against rebel attack. Nicknamed the \\"Soldiers' Friend\\", he helped organize the Illinois contingent of Union soldiers, including commissioning Ulysses S. Grant as a colonel for an Illinois regiment. He supported the Emancipation Proclamation. He also represented Illinois in the United States House of Representatives (1851–1855) and in the U.S. Senate (1865–1871). As a Senator, he voted and spoke in favor of removing President Andrew Johnson from office. Early life Yates was born in a log cabin in Warsaw, Kentucky. His family was of English descent and moved to Illinois in 1831. He studied at Miami University and Georgetown College and graduated from Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1835. He then studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He was admitted to the bar in 1837 and commenced practice in Jacksonville. Yates served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1842 to 1845 and 1848 to 1849. In 1850, he was elected as a Whig to the United States House of Representatives, where he was the youngest member of the Thirty-second Congress. He was reelected to Congress in 1852. During Yates' second term in Congress, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise reignited the anti-slavery controversy. He opposed the repeal, which opened the possibility of slavery expanding into Kansas, and became identified with the new Republican Party. Illinois Democrats redrew the boundaries of his district to favor their candidate, and Yates narrowly lost his bid for a third term in Congress. Yates then worked for a time as president of a railroad company. Remaining politically engaged, he campaigned on behalf of Republican presidential candidate John C. Frémont in the 1856 election. He was known as an excellent orator. He had a weakness for whiskey, though at times he strove to exercise temperance. In later years, he was often conspicuously drunk, even at public functions. By 1867 he had \\"resolve[d] to quit drink altogether\\" but was unable to persist in this resolution. Governorship Polasek outside the Illinois State Capitol In 1860 he was elected governor as a Republican; he and Abraham Lincoln, with whom he was friendly, supported each other's campaigns in Illinois. Yates's inaugural address denied that states had any right to secede from the Union and declared that \\"a claim so presumptuous and absurd could never be acquiesced in\\"; he also predicted that the Union would \\"in the end, be stronger and richer and more glorious, renowned and free, than it has ever been heretofore, by the necessary reaction of the crisis through which [they were] passing.\\" Governor Yates continued to be an outspoken opponent of slavery, and at the opening of the Civil War was very active in raising volunteers. He convened the legislature in extra session on April 12, 1861, the day after the attack on Fort Sumter, and took military possession of Cairo, garrisoning it with regular troops. Illinois banks made $1,000,000 available to Yates to equip the new Illinois troops raised in response to Lincoln's call. At Yates's suggestion, Lincoln authorized Illinois troops to protect the federal arsenal in St. Louis. In Governor Yates's office, General Ulysses S. Grant received his first distinct recognition as a soldier in the Civil War, being appointed by Yates as mustering officer for the state, and afterward colonel of the 21st Illinois regiment. Yates would also secure military commissions for John A. Logan, John A. McClernand, and John M. Palmer (all prominent Democrats). Lincoln disregarded a hint from Yates that he would accept a commission as brigadier general on the grounds that Yates was too important as a loyal governor. After the Battle of Shiloh, Yates personally took hospital supplies to the succor of the wounded from his state, as did the wartime governors of Wisconsin (Salomon) and Indiana (Morton). Such humanitarian gestures cemented Yates's popularity, and the governor enjoyed the nickname of the \\"Soldiers' Friend\\". In September 1862, Yates attended the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately gave Abraham Lincoln support for his Emancipation Proclamation. During the Civil War, Yates benefited from his relations with Lincoln to bring significant federal financial resources to the State of Illinois and Chicago in particular. Chicago became the location for the largest prisoner of war encampment, Camp Douglas, which had been erected on the former estate of Lincoln's political opponent, the late Senator Stephen A. Douglas (similarly, the estate of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Arlington, Virginia was taken over by the government for use as a military cemetery). During this period, Yates enlisted the services of former Chicago Mayor James Hutchinson Woodworth, a Republican with strong anti-slavery views similar to those of Yates, to oversee the disbursement and management of the federal funds received. In his 1863 annual message, Yates denounced the talk among some secession sympathizers that the Union might be reconstructed to the exclusion of New England. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the Democratic- dominated Illinois legislature proved increasingly uncooperative. Yates, fearing that the Democrats had been infiltrated by the pro-secession Knights of the Golden Circle, dissolved the Illinois legislature on June 10, 1863, declaring that \\"the past history of the Assembly hold[s] out no reasonable hope of beneficial results to the citizens of the State, or the army in the field, from its further continuance\\". Senatorial and later career Richard Yates After his service as governor ended, Yates was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1865, to March 3, 1871. While in the Senate, Yates was Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (Thirty-ninth and Forty-first Congresses) and Chairman of the Committee on Territories (Fortieth Congress). He was identified as an associate and \\"disciple\\" of Charles Sumner, the Radical Senator from Massachusetts. During the impeachment proceedings against Andrew Johnson, Yates spoke in favor of convicting the President, whom he described as a \\"most pestilent disturber of public peace ... who, through murder succeeded to the chief command and seeks to betray us to the enemy.\\" Yates did not seek reelection to the Senate. After leaving the Senate, he was appointed by President Grant as a United States commissioner to inspect a land subsidy railroad. He died suddenly in St. Louis, Missouri on November 27, 1873. He is buried in Diamond Grove Cemetery, Jacksonville, Illinois. Legacy In 1923 a statue of Yates by Albin Polasek was erected on the Illinois State Capitol grounds. His son, Richard Yates, Jr., was also active in Illinois politics, and also became governor of Illinois. References Bibliography  The standard scholarly history.

From 1919 to 1933, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois. Although he failed to receive his party's nomination in 1928 to the Seventy-first Congress, he was later appointed nominee and elected in place of Henry R. Rathbone who died prior to the election. In 1932, he was unsuccessful in his bid for reelection to the Seventy-third Congress. His father, also Richard Yates, was also an Illinois politician; indeed, the senior Yates was Illinois' popular Civil War governor, and the younger Yates spent a portion of his boyhood living in the Executive Mansion in Springfield, which would one day again be his home. The son was born in Jacksonville, Illinois and attended public schools and, from 1870 to 1874, the Illinois Woman's College (now MacMurray College). He was the city editor of the Daily Courier in 1878 and 1879, and of the Daily Journal from 1881 to 1883. Yates graduated from Illinois College in Jacksonville in 1880 and from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1884. He practiced law in Jacksonville and was city attorney of Jacksonville 1885–1890 and county judge of Morgan County 1894–1897. From 1897 to 1900, Yates was United States collector of internal revenue for the eighth internal revenue district. In 1900, Yates was elected governor in his own right while he was not yet 40 years of age. He began his campaign as a \\"dark horse\\" under the cloak of neutrality, which won him support from Senator Shelby Moore Cullom's \\"federal crowd\\". Congressman William Lorimer, who had backed another candidate in a field of well-known men, suddenly switched at the Republican convention, grabbing up a Yates banner and proceeding to stampede the convention. The results of the third ballot were never announced; Yates was then nominated on the fourth. The subsequent, decisive election sent Yates to the governor's chair by 61,233 votes over Democrat Samuel Alschuler of Aurora. The keynote legislation signed during the governorship of Richard Yates was a new child labor law, the first of its kind in any state, restricting the work week of children to no more than 48 hours. Another significant move of the administration was the signing of a bill permitting municipal ownership of street railways. Yates restricted prison industries, but vetoed a bill calling for a centralized audit of all state agencies. The veto is significant in light of the Chicago press of the day. Highly critical of the stylish governor, who retained the parade pomp of John Tanner and his \\"sunburst colonels\\", Chicago newspapers alleged that Yates Jr. was compelling state employees to contribute to a slush fund. Further accusations had it that campaign work was compulsory for state employees under Yates. In 1904, Yates was the first Republican West of the Ohio to declare for Theodore Roosevelt. An ironic side note is that at the end of his political career, driven from Congress by the landslide which carried TR's distant cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt and an overwhelming number of Democratic candidates into office, Richard Yates Jr. of Illinois polled more votes than any other Republican in the state. Yates, despite being a sitting governor, did not receive his party's nomination in 1904; he led the field of six candidates for 58 ballots, before throwing his support behind State's Attorney Charles S. Deneen in order to prevent the nomination of Frank O. Lowden, Yates' chief rival at the convention. In his years prior to Congress, Yates was popular on the Chautauqua circuit, as well as working patronage jobs, such as serving in charge of telephone companies as a member of the state utility commission. Yates served as a private in Company I, Fifth Infantry, Illinois National Guard from 1885 to 1890. His final act of service was to cast a vote in 1933 against the repeal of the 18th Amendment (Prohibition). After leaving Congress, Yates resided in Harbor Springs, Michigan, and Springfield, Illinois, while writing his memoirs. He died in Springfield and was buried in Diamond Grove Cemetery, Jacksonville.

The total protein concentration is exhibited by a color change of the sample solution in proportion to protein concentration, which can then be measured using colorimetric techniques. It is named for the biochemist Oliver H. Lowry who developed the reagent in the 1940s. His 1951 paper describing the technique is the most-highly cited paper ever in the scientific literature, cited over 300,000 times. Mechanism The method combines the reactions of copper ions with the peptide bonds under alkaline conditions (the Biuret test) with the oxidation of aromatic protein residues. The Lowry method is based on the reaction of Cu+, produced by the oxidation of peptide bonds, with Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (a mixture of phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid in the Folin–Ciocalteu reaction). The reaction mechanism is not well understood, but involves reduction of the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and oxidation of aromatic residues (mainly tryptophan, also tyrosine). Experiments have shown that cysteine is also reactive to the reagent. Therefore, cysteine residues in protein probably also contribute to the absorbance seen in the Lowry assay. The result of this reaction is an intense blue molecule known as heteropolymolybdenum Blue. The concentration of the reduced Folin reagent (heteropolymolybdenum Blue) is measured by absorbance at 660 nm. As a result, the total concentration of protein in the sample can be deduced from the concentration of tryptophan and tyrosine residues that reduce the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. The method was first proposed by Lowry in 1951. The Bicinchoninic acid assay and the Hartree–Lowry assay are subsequent modifications of the original Lowry procedure.

Hildegar, who lived in the ninth century, says in his \\"Life of St. Faro\\" (Burgundofaro), that this bishop was the twentieth since St. Denis. According to the tradition accepted by Hildegaire, St. Denis was the first Bishop of Meaux, and was succeeded by his disciple Saint Saintin, who in turn was succeeded by St. Antoninus; and another saint, named Rigomer, occupied the See of Meaux at the close of the fifth century. In 876 or 877, Hincmar showed Charles the Bald a document which he claimed had been transcribed from a very old copy and according to which St. Antoninus and Saint Saintin, disciples of Saint Denis, had brought to Pope Anacletus the account of the martyrdom of St. Denis, and on their return to Gaul had successively occupied the See of Meaux. Councils A council convoked in 845 at Meaux by Charles the Bald adopted important measures for the re-establishment of discipline in the three ecclesiastical provinces of Sens, Bourges, and Reims. Other councils were held at Meaux in 962,The meeting at the Matrona River (Marne) in the territory of Meaux in 962 was made necessary by conflict over the succession to the diocese of Reims, following the death of Archbishop Artaldus. Thirteen bishops met under the presidency of Archbishop of Sens. One Hugues was a controversial candidate, and so the matter was referred to Rome. Pope John XII rejected Hugues, and Odalric was elected instead. J.D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima XVIII (Venice: Zatta 1773), pp. 459-460. 1082,Du Plessis, I, p. 108, places the council in 1080, and notes that it was presided over by Bishop Hugues de Die, the Papal Legate. Ursion Bishop of Soissons was deposed. 1204,The Council of 1204 was ordered by Pope Innocent III, and was presided over by his Apostolic Legate, the Cistercian Abbot John of Casamare. Its purpose was to bring about peace between King John of England and King Philip II of France. It failed. Mansi, Vol. XX (Venice 1778), pp. 745-750. 1229 (ended in Paris), where the Count of Toulouse was reconciled with the Church; in 1240 a council was held in which the sentence of excommunication was pronounced against Frederick II by Joannes of Palestrina, legate of Gregory IX; there was held an important council in 1523. Four councils were held at Melun, in 1216, 1225, 1232, 1300. The city of Provins was famous in the Middle Ages for its burlesque ceremonies (fête de fous, fête do l'âne, fête des Innocents) held in the church. The church of Champigny has a magnificent crypt dating from the thirteenth century. The cathedral of St-Etienne de Meaux is a fine Gothic edifice begun about 1170. The pouillé of 1353 shows that the Chapter of the Cathedral had six dignities and at least thirty-seven Canons (who are named). The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Meaux, the Archdeacon of Brie, the Cantor, the Treasurer and the Chancellor.A. Longnon, Pouillés de la province de Sens (Paris: Imprimérie nationale 1904), pp. 460-461; cf. p. 472. In 1681 there were 6 dignities and 37 Canons: Ritzler, V, p. 263 note 1. In 1759 there were 6 dignities and 43 Canons: Ritzler, VI, p. 284 note 1. Notable events Pope Eugene III stayed some days at Meaux from 12 June to 30 June 1147.P. Jaffe, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Leipzig: Veit 1888), pp. 44-45. In 1562 most of the inhabitants of Meaux had become Protestants. In the First War of Religion Joachim de Montluc, sent by the king, proceeded with rigour against them. They were still sufficiently powerful in 1567 to attempt to carry off, in the vicinity of Meaux, Catherine de' Medici and Charles IX; and so for that reason, shortly after St. Bartholomew's day in August 1572, Charles IX ordered the massacre of the Protestants of Meaux. At the château of Fontainebleau, built by Francis I, was held the theological conference of 4 May 1600, between the Catholics (Cardinal du Perron, de Thou, Pithou) and the Calvinists (du Plessis Mornay, Philippe Canaye, Isaac Casaubon). In 1664 Blessed Eudes preached for two months at Meaux, Mme Guyon passed the first six months of 1695 at the Visitation convent of Meaux, where Bossuet had frequent conferences with her, but failed to make her abandon her mystic views. The well-known Père Nicolas Loriquet (1767–1845) was superior of the preparatory seminary (the Pétit Seminaire) of Châage, in the Diocese of Meaux, from 1812 to 1814. He was particularly famous for his insistence on the importance of history in the curriculum, and for his elementary textbooks in the subject. His Histoire de France was anti-revolutionary and anti-Napoleonic, and caused controversy for some decades. Revolution The diocese of Meaux was abolished during the French Revolution by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Seine-et-Marne', which was part of the Metropolitanate called the 'Metropole de Paris' (which included seven new 'départements'). The Civil Constitution mandated that bishops be elected by the citizens of each 'département', which immediately raised the most severe canonical questions, since the electors did not need to be Catholics and the approval of the Pope was not only not required, but actually forbidden. Erection of new dioceses and transfer of bishops, moreover, was not in the competence of civil authorities or of the Church in France. The result was schism between the 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church. The legitimate bishop of Meaux, Camille de Polignac, refused to take the oath, and therefore the episcopal seat was declared vacant. Two-thirds of the clergy of Meaux, however, took the oath. On 27 February 1791 the electors of Seine-et-Marne were assembled, and on 18 March, after three ballots, they elected the parish priest of Dontilly, Pierre Thuin. Thuin travelled to Paris for his consecration, which was carried out on 27 March by Jean-Baptiste Gobel, the titular Bishop of Lydda, who had just been installed as Constitutional Bishop of Paris. Thuin's installation at Meaux was not attended by the Canons of the Cathedral or by the directors of the diocesan seminary. Bishop de Polignac emigrated to Switzerland and then to Hungary; he did not return until 1814. Thuin, and all the Constitutional Bishops, were required to resign in May 1801 by First Consul Bonaparte, who was negotiating a treaty with Pope Pius VII, the Concordat of 1801 (15 July 1801). Once the Concordat went into effect, Pius VII was able to issue the appropriate bulls to restore many of the dioceses and to regulate their boundaries, most of which corresponded closely to the new 'départements'.

Current Bishop Bishop Jean-Yves Nahmias Bishop Jean-Yves Nahmias was born on September 16, 1957 in Saint-Mand, near Paris, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Créteil in Créteil, France. He studied at the University of Paris I, where he has been a member of G.F.U. (Groupes de Formation Universitaire); he graduated with a License in Financial Law. He pursued his studies in philosophy and theology for two years at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, then as a student of the French Seminary in Rome, and then in the Institute of Theological Studies in Brussels, where he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Theology in 1991. Nahmias was ordained to the priesthood on June 24, 1989, and was incardinated for service to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris. Nahmias served as Parochial Vicar (Assistant Pastor) at the Parish of Notre-Dame de la Croix, Paris, and as a Chaplain in Public Schools Jean-Baptiste-Clément, Etienne Dolet and Martin Nadaud (1990-1994). In addition, from 1992 to 1996, was in charge of the Diocesan Service for Vocations, and from 1993, Director of Office for Vocations. Later, he was the Parochial Vicar at the Parish Saint-Ambroise, and a Chaplain in Public Schools Voltaire and Alain-Fournier (1994-1996). He became Rector of the Archdiocesan Seminary of Paris and the Diocesan Delegate for the Seminarians (1996-2001); and finally, was the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Paris under Cardinals Jean-Marie Lustiger and André Vingt-Trois (2001-2006). Father Nahmias was appointed as Titular Bishop of Termini Imerese and Auxiliary Bishop of Paris on June 1, 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI, and was consecrated a bishop on September 8, 2006.

President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called, \\"relocation centers\\" like Topaz during World War II. Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945. The camp, approximately west of Delta, Utah, consisted of , with a main living area. Most internees lived in the main living area, though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers. The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time. The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable, even after the belated installation of pot- bellied stoves. The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school, a library, and some recreational facilities. Camp life was documented in a newspaper, Topaz Times, and in the literary publication Trek. Internees worked inside and outside the camp, mostly in agricultural labor. Many internees became notable artists. In the winter of 1942–1943, a loyalty questionnaire asked prisoners if they would declare their loyalty to the United States of America and if they would be willing to enlist. The questions were divisive, and prisoners who were considered \\"disloyal\\" because of their answers on the loyalty questionnaire were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Camp. One internee, James Wakasa, was shot and killed for being too close to the camp's fence. Topaz prisoners held a large funeral and stopped working until administrators relaxed security. In 1983, Jane Beckwith founded the Topaz Museum Board. Topaz became a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2007. After many years of organizing, fundraising, and collecting information and artifacts, the Topaz Museum was built in Delta and debuted with a display of the art created at Topaz. Permanent exhibits, installed in 2017, chronicle the people who were interned there and tell their stories. Terminology Since the end of World War II, there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to Topaz and the other camps in which Americans of Japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents were imprisoned by the United States government during the war. Topaz has been referred to as a \\"relocation camp,\\" \\"relocation center,\\" \\"internment camp,\\" and \\"concentration camp,\\" and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continued throughout the late 1990s. In a preface to a 1997 book on Topaz written and published by the Topaz Museum, the Topaz Museum Board informs readers that it is accurate to refer to the camps as a \\"detention camp\\" or \\"concentration camp\\" and its residents as \\"prisoners\\" or \\"internees\\". History Chart showing the age distribution at Topaz Internment Center on January 30, 1943 In December 1941, the Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Shortly afterwards in February 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. The order forced approximately 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent (Nisei) and Japanese-born residents (Issei) in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska on the West Coast of the United States to leave their homes. About 5,000 left the off- limits area during the \\"voluntary evacuation\\" period, and avoided internment. The remaining 110,000 were soon removed from their homes by Army and National Guard troops. Topaz was opened September 11, 1942, and eventually became the fifth-largest city in Utah, with over 9,000 internees and staff, and covering approximately (mostly used for agriculture). A total of 11,212 people lived at Topaz at one time or another. Utah governor Herbert B. Maw opposed the relocation of any Japanese Americans into the state, stating that if they were such a danger to the West Coast, they would be a danger to Utah. Most internees arrived at Topaz from the Tanforan or Santa Anita Park holding centers; the majority hailed from the San Francisco Bay Area. Sixty-five percent were Nisei, American citizens born to Japanese immigrants. The camp was governed by Charles F. Ernst until June 1944, when the position was taken over by Luther T. Hoffman following Ernst's resignation. It was closed on October 31, 1945. Topaz was originally known as the Central Utah Relocation Authority, and then the Abraham Relocation Authority, but the names were too long for post office regulations. The final name, Topaz, came from Topaz Mountain which overlooks the camp from away. Topaz was the primary internment site in the state of Utah. A smaller camp existed briefly a few miles north of Moab, which was used to isolate a few men considered to be troublemakers prior to their being sent to Leupp, Arizona. A site at Antelope Springs, in the mountains west of Topaz, was used as a recreation area by the residents and staff of Topaz. Life A young internee playing in a nursery school Climate Most internees came from the San Francisco Bay Area, which has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, with moist mild winters and dry summers. Topaz had an extreme climate, located at above sea level in the Sevier Desert. A \\"Midlatitude Desert\\" under the Köppen classification, temperatures could vary greatly throughout the day. The area experienced powerful winds and dust storms. One such storm caused structural damage to 75 buildings in 1944. Temperatures could reach below freezing from mid-September until the end of May. The average temperature in January was . Spring rains turned the clay soil to mud, which bred mosquitoes. Summers were hot, with occasional thunderstorms and temperatures that could exceed . In 1942, the first snowfall occurred on October 13, before camp construction was fully complete. Architecture and living arrangements Topaz contained a living complex known as the \\"city\\", about , as well as extensive agricultural lands. Within the city, forty-two blocks were for internees, thirty-four of which were residential. Each residential block housed 200–300 people, housed in barracks that held five people within a single room. Families were generally housed together, while single adults would be housed with four other unrelated individuals. Residential blocks also contained a recreation hall, a mess hall, an office for the block manager, and a combined laundry/toilet/bathing facility. Each block contained only four bathtubs for all the women and four showers for all the men living there. These packed conditions often resulted in little privacy for residents. Barracks were built out of wood frame covered in tarpaper, with wooden floors. Many internees moved into the barracks before they were completed, exposing them to harsh weather. Eventually, they were lined with sheetrock, and the floors filled with masonite. While the construction began in July 1942, the first inmates moved in in September 1942, and the camp was not completed until early 1943. Camp construction was completed in part by 214 interned laborers who volunteered to arrive early and help build the camp. Rooms were heated by pot-bellied stoves. There was no furniture provided. Inmates used communal leftover scrap wood from construction to build beds, tables, and cabinets. Some families also modified their living quarters with fabric partitions. Water came from wells and was stored in a large wooden tank, and was \\"almost undrinkable\\" because of its alkalinity. Topaz also included a number of communal areas: a high school, two elementary schools, a 28-bed hospital, at least two churches, and a community garden. There was a cemetery as well, although it was never used. All 144 people who died in the camp were cremated and their ashes were held for burial until after the war. The camp was patrolled by 85–150 policemen, and was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Manned watchtowers with searchlights were placed every surrounding the perimeter of the camp. Daily life The camp was designed to be self-sufficient, and the majority of land within the camp was devoted to farming. Topaz inmates raised cattle, pigs, and chickens in addition to feed crops and vegetables. The vegetables were high-quality and won awards at the Millard County Fair. Due to harsh weather, poor soil, and short growing conditions, the camp was not able to supply all of its animal feed. Topaz contained two elementary schools: Desert View Elementary and Mountain View Elementary. Topaz High School educated students grades 7–12, and there was also an adult education program. The schools were taught by a combination of local teachers and internees. They were under-equipped and overcrowded, but enthusiastic teachers did their best. Topaz High School developed a devoted community, with frequent reunions after internment ended, and a final reunion in 2012. Sports were popular within the schools as well as the adult population, with sports including baseball, basketball, and sumo wrestling. Cultural associations sprung up throughout the camp. Topaz had a newspaper called the Topaz Times, a literary publication called Trek, and two libraries which eventually contained almost 7,000 items in both English and Japanese. Artist Chiura Obata led the Tanforan Art School at Topaz, offering art instruction to over 600 students. Internment rules usurped parental authority, and teenagers often ate meals with their friends and only joined their families to sleep at night. This combined with a lack of privacy made it difficult for parents to discipline and bond with their children, which contributed to teenage delinquency in the camp. Internees clear land for agricultural use. Some internees were permitted to leave the camp to find employment. In 1942, internees were able to get permission to leave the camp for employment in nearby Delta, where they filled labor shortages caused by the draft, mostly in agricultural labor. In 1943 over 500 internees obtained seasonal agricultural work outside the camp, with another 130 working in domestic and industrial jobs. Polling showed that a majority of Utahns supported this policy. One teacher at the camp art school, Chiura Obata, was allowed to leave Topaz to run classes at nearby universities and churches. Internees were also sometimes permitted to leave the camp for recreation. A former Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Antelope Springs, in mountains to the west, was taken over as a recreation area for internees and camp staff, and two buildings from Antelope Springs were brought to the central area to be used as Buddhist and Christian churches. During a rock hunting expedition in the Drum Mountains, west of Topaz, Akio Uhihera and Yoshio Nishimoto discovered and excavated a rare iron meteorite, which the Smithsonian Institution acquired. Camp politics James Wakasa's funeral In 1943, the War Relocation Authority (WRA) issued all adult internees a questionnaire assessing their level of Americanization. It was entitled \\"Application for Leave Clearance\\". Questions asked about what language they spoke most frequently, their religion, and recreational activities. Participating in judo and kendo were \\"Japanese\\" activities, while playing baseball or being Christian were considered \\"American\\". Two questions asked prisoners if they were willing to fight in the US Armed Forces and if they would swear allegiance to the United States and renounce loyalty to the Emperor of Japan. Many Japanese-born Issei, who were barred from attaining American citizenship, resented the second question, feeling that an affirmative answer would leave them effectively stateless. Some Issei volunteered to join the army, even though there was no enlistment procedure for non-citizens. Others objected on other political grounds. In Topaz, nearly a fifth of male residents answered \\"no\\" to the question about allegiance. Inmates expressed their anger through a few scattered assaults against other inmates who they perceived as too close to the administration. Chiura Obata was among those attacked, resulting in his immediate release for fear of further assaults. A reworded version of the questionnaire for Issei did not require them to renounce their loyalty to the emperor of Japan. In response to the questionnaires, some Nisei formed the Resident Council for Japanese American Civil Rights, which encouraged other prisoners to register for the draft if their civil rights were restored. Guards fatally shot sixty-three-year-old James Wakasa on April 11, 1943 for wandering too close to the camp fence. Internees went on strike protesting the death and surrounding secrecy. They held a large funeral for Wakasa as a way to express their outrage. In response, the administration determined that fears of subversive activity at the camp were largely without basis, and significantly relaxed security. The military decided that officers who had been at war in the Pacific would not be assigned to guard duty at Topaz. The guard who shot Wakasa was reassigned after being found not guilty of violating military law; this information was not given to internees. Topaz internees Fred Korematsu and Mitsuye Endo challenged their internment in court. Korematsu's case was heard and rejected at the US Supreme Court (Korematsu v. United States), the largest case to challenge internment, while Endo's case was upheld. Hog farm where internees raised pork for the camp's kitchen After closing The remains of the camp as seen from 20,000 feet in 2009 Topaz Museum in Delta, Utah After Topaz was closed, the land was sold and most of the buildings were auctioned off, disassembled, and removed from the site. Even the water pipes and utility poles were sold. Numerous foundations, concrete-lined excavations and other ground-level features can be seen at the various sites, but few buildings remain, and natural vegetation has taken over most of the abandoned areas. In 1976, the Japanese American Citizens League placed a monument on the northwestern corner of the central area. On March 29, 2007, United States Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne designated \\"Central Utah Relocation Center Site\\" a National Historic Landmark. In 1982, Delta High School teacher Jane Beckwith and her journalism students began to study Topaz. She spearheaded the creation of the Topaz Museum Board in 1983, which oversaw the Topaz Museum, which initially shared space with the Great Basin Museum. Funding from the Japanese-American Confinement Sites organization enabled the Topaz Board to construct its own museum building in 2013. In 2015, the museum formally opened with an exhibition of art created at Topaz, entitled \\"When Words Weren't Enough: Works on Paper from Topaz, 1942-1945.\\" The museum closed for remodeling in November 2016, and reopened in 2017 as a traditional museum focused on the history of Topaz. By 2017, the Topaz Museum and Board had purchased 634 of the 640 acres of the original internment site.

In media In film Using a smuggled camera, Dave Tatsuno shot film of Topaz. The documentary Topaz uses film he shot from 1943 to 1945. This film was an inductee of the 1997 National Film Registry list, with the added distinction of being the second \\"home movie\\" to be included on the Registry and the only color footage of camp life. Topaz War Relocation Center is the setting for the 2007 film American Pastime, a dramatization based on actual events, which tells the story of Nikkei baseball in the camps. A portion of the camp was duplicated for location shooting in Utah's Skull Valley, approximately west of Salt Lake City and north of the actual Topaz site. The film used some of Tatsuno's historical footage. In addition to Tatsuno's Topaz, Ken Verdoia made a 1987 documentary, also entitled Topaz. In literature Yoshiko Uchida's young adult novel Journey to Topaz recounts the story of Yuki, a young Japanese American girl, whose world is disrupted when, shortly after Pearl Harbor, she and her family must leave their comfortable home in the Berkeley, California suburbs for the dusty barracks of Topaz. The book is largely based on Uchida's personal experiences: she and her family were interned at Topaz for three years. Julie Otsuka's novel When the Emperor was Divine tells the story of a family forced to relocate from Berkeley to Topaz in September 1942. Each of the novel's five chapters is told from the point of view of a different character. Critics praised the book's \\"precise but poetic evocation of the ordinary\\" and \\"ability to empathize.\\" Over 45 colleges and universities included it in their required reading for freshmen. In art Much of the art made by detainees at the camp depicted life there, and survives. Drawings and woodcuts by Chiura Obata and Matsusaburō (George) Hibi are among the most prominent. Some of it is collected in The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps, 1942–1946 by Delphine Hirasuna, and has been exhibited in Topaz and at the Wight Art Gallery. In 2018, the Utah Museum of Fine Arts exhibited many Chiura Obata's works, including some made at Topaz.  See also  *Japanese American Internment References Further reading  Kim, Chang Kyun (2019).

As the name suggests, its coloration is a combination of bars, spots, and speckles randomly distributed. The large pectoral fins are banded. The first dorsal fin is made of slender and somewhat soft spines, and just barely joins with the second dorsal. Maximum length is 15 cm. It feeds primarily on aquatic insect larvae, but will also eat crustaceans, small fish, fish eggs, and some plant material. In turn, the sculpin is preyed upon by other fish, notably trout. Favored habitat is well-oxygenated and clear water, such as over gravel riffles in mountain streams, springs, and along rocky lake shores. Spawning takes place during early winter and late spring. The male's head becomes darker, and he selects a protected nest site, such as under a rock or ledge. After courtship, the female enters the nest, turns upside down, and deposits her eggs on the ceiling, where they adhere. Typically several females will deposit eggs in a nest, then the male fertilizes and guards them, fanning the eggs with his pectoral fins. Mottled sculpin occurrence is discontinuous in its range. It is widespread from the Tennessee River north to Labrador, while separate populations are found in the Missouri River, the Columbia River system in southern Canada, and the Bonneville system of the Great Basin. Introduction Mottled sculpins, Cottus bairdi, are a common fish throughout most of North America. The only area that mottled sculpin are provided limited protection is in New Mexico.http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/fish_cattle/Mottled%20sculpin.pdf Mottled sculpins feed on a wide variety of organisms, including mollusks, snails, other mottled sculpins, and trout. Their diets are mainly made up of bottom-dwelling benthic insects.Bailey, JE. 1952. Life history and ecology of the sculpin Cottus bardi punctulatus in southwerstern Montana. Copeia 1952(4): 243-255. The favored habitat of a mottled sculpin is one rich in macroinvertebrate prey, which usually occurs in fast riffle areasRashleigh, B, GD Grossman. 2005.

Habitat segregation between Cottus bairdi and Cottus girardi :an example of complex inter- and intraspecific resource partitioning. American Midland Naturalist 110(1): 165-176. Spawning season for the mottled sculpin starts in April or May Downhower, JF, L Brown, R Pederson, G Staples. 1983. Sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in mottled sculpins. Evolution 37(1):96-103. with the males taking up residency in benthic rocks. Breeding season lasts for two to three months.Downhower, JF, LS Blumer. 1987. Seasonal variation in sexual selection in the mottle sculpin. Evolution 41(6): 1386-1394. Clutch size can vary anywhere from 8 eggs to 148 eggs for females. Males can have up to 1587 eggs in their nest. Sexual maturity is thought to be reached at two years of age. Climate change does not seem to be a threat to this species since they inhabit a wide range of temperature gradient throughout the United States. However, one human activity that affects them is runoff from mining, which particularly is harmful to the newly hatched larvae and developing eggs.Besser, JM, CA Mebane, DR Mount, CD Ivey, JL Kunz. 2007. Sensitivity of mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to acute and chronic toxicity of cadmium, copper, and zinc. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 26(8): 1657-1665. Nothing is being done for current management for the mottled sculpin because it is a very abundant fish where it occurs. Future management could focus on the different metals that leak into the water from mining. The absence of the mottled sculpin from an area could tell us that the area has high levels of zinc, cadmium, or copper. Geographic distribution of species The mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdii, is known to inhabit a large geographical range in North America. Their natural habitat range is from Northern Canada down to the Mobile and Tennessee River drainage systems. They are also commonly found in streams in the Rocky Mountains along with many streams found throughout the Midwest United States. The mottled sculpin has historically been found throughout all the environments listed above. For the most part, the geographical range of the mottled sculpin has not changed throughout the years due to it is being a resilient fish and because it has a large temperature gradient in which it can reside. However, in a study by Besser and others in 2007, mottled sculpins have been absent in streams thought to be populated by them in the past due to the species being more sensitive to toxic levels of cadmium, copper, and zinc than species of salmonids. Of these three metals zinc seems to be the most threatening to the mottled sculpin. One study found mottled sculpins to be the third most sensitive aquatic species to zinc.Brinkman, S., and J. Woodling. 2005. Zinc toxicity to the mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) in high-hardness water. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 24:1515-1517. Therefore, the biggest threat to the species would be high mining areas or areas where coal is burned frequently. Ecology Mottled sculpins are known for living in fast moving current areas where they feed primarily on bottom dwelling aquatic insects. One study found that bottom dwelling aquatic insects make up 99.7% of the mottled sculpin's diet, with dipterous larvae and pupae being the most common type found. The remaining 0.3% was made up of snails, fingernail clams, water mites, sculpin eggs and fish. Thus the mottled sculpin is not a major threat to game fish though it has been found to eat trout eggs.Dineen, C. F. 1951. A comparative study of the food habitats of Cottus bairdii and associated species of Salmonidae. American Midland Naturalist 46:640-645. Sculpin are cannibalistic. Males are known to eat their young if one contracts some kind of virus or fungus. The males also eat small females. Therefore, older females are usually chosen for mates over younger females. The main predators of the sculpin are different species of game fish, such as brook trout, brown trout, northern pike, and smallmouth bass. All sculpin species are expected to coexist with species from the family Salmonidae. Its main competitors are other small bottom dwelling fish, especially other sculpin species . Female and immature mottled sculpins are commonly found in clean water rock substrates. On the other hand, males are commonly found in algae beds. The mean current velocity in which the fish is found is 0.28 m/s. They prefer to inhabit cool clear streams. They will tolerate warmer streams but do not prefer them like Cottus girardi. Life history Mottled sculpin reach sexual maturity at the age of two.Hann, H.W. 1927. The history of the germ cells of Cottus bairdi Girard. Journal of Morphology and Physiology 43:427-497 . The breeding season for mottled sculpin is during April and May. At the beginning of the season the males will take refuge under flat-bottomed rocks, waterlogged wood or other rubble found in stream beds. In order to mate the female will come up to the males nest and lay her eggs there. The female chooses her mate on physical attributes. Since larger males pick out nesting sites with better resources qualities, the female's choice of the largest male indicates she is picking good genes in a mate and also a good environment for her young to grow up After mating she either leaves or is chased away by the male. The males do this because females will eat the eggs right after spawning if the male does not run her off.Savage, T. 1963. Reproductive behavior of the mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdi Girard. Copeia 1963:317-325. The males continue to protect the eggs until they have absorbed their yolk sac and are ready to distribute themselves.Downhower, J.F., and R. Yost. The significance of male parental care in the mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdi. American Zoology 17:936. Mottled sculpins only mate once a year. The clutch size can vary anywhere from 8 eggs to 148 eggs for females. However within that year one male could mate with ten or more femalesDownhower, J.F., and L. Brown. 1980. Mate preferences of female mottles sculpins, Cottus bairdi. Animal Behavior 28:728-734. This leads to very large nest sizes. One study looked at twelve different nesting sites within a year and found that one nest can have anywhere from 54 to 1587 eggs with an average of 744 eggs per nest. Mottled sculpins' average life span is six years. Conservation The mottled sculpin is currently not federal or state listed for being threatened or endangered. In New Mexico the species is given limited protection. The reason for the species receiving no current management plan is due to its high abundance all over North America. Its high prevalence is due to the species tolerance' for all types of environment. Although the species is not threatened anywhere in North America, it has received attention in recent areas in the Western United States due to its absence in some streams that are highly populated with trout species but not sculpins. This was odd since the two species usually coexist in similar habitats. The problem was that the streams absent of sculpin had high concentrations of zinc. One study showed that mottled sculpin are the third most sensitive species to high levels of zinc. The reason this occurring is because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses trout species to determine the water quality criteria (WQC) for zinc.Woodling, J., S. Brinkman, and S. Albeke. 2002. Acute and chronic toxicity f zinc to the mottled sculpin Cottus bairdi Therefore, the WQC standards are not good enough to protect all species of fish. In southeast Minnesota there are plans to rebuild the sculpin population in streams where the water quality was once unfavorable for the species but has since been improved. The next step is to introduce 200 mottled sculpin a year until the population is showing signs of a comeback in the local streams. However zinc is not the only metal threatening mottled sculpin populations. One study found mottled sculpins were also more sensitive to levels of copper and cadmium than other species of fish . The leading causes of increase of these three metals into aquatic environments are from mining, the burning of coal, steel production, and smelting metals.

The station currently broadcasts an adult contemporary format branded on-air as \\"93.3 The Peak\\" and is owned by Jim Pattison Group. History CJAV began operations on April 1, 1946 at 1240 AM, using a 250 watt transmitter upon startup. The station, originally owned by Harold Warren, was the starting point for the careers of a number of broadcasters, including Jack Cullen (who later moved on to CKNW, then located in New Westminster), Joe Chesney (who went on to found Langley station CJJC [now CKST Vancouver] in 1963), George Cowie (later of CFUN Vancouver), Bob Switzer (later of Vancouver CBC Television station CBUT), Philip Barter (who moved on to CHEK in Victoria and CHAN in Vancouver) and Jim Robson (who became the radio voice of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks on CKNW). A year after CJAV signed on, Warren sold 50% of the station to CKNW founder Bill Rea, with Chuck Rudd and Ken Hutcheson later acting as station managers under Rea. In 1952, Warren sold his remaining ownership stake to Rudd and Hutcheson. In 1960, CJAV's operating power increased to 1000 watts in the daytime, remaining at 250 watts at night, and the station was on hand to cover the aftermath of the tsunami that affected the then-twin cities of Port Alberni and Alberni on March 27, 1964, following the Good Friday earthquake that hit Anchorage, Alaska earlier that day. CJAV, an affiliate of CBC Radio since sign-on in 1946, was authorized by the CRTC Decision CRTC 84-466 on June 5, 1984 to disaffiliate from the network after CBC established Port Alberni repeater station CBTQ-FM, originally a rebroadcaster of Vancouver station CBU (now rebroadcasting CBCV-FM in Victoria), in December 1983. On December 13, 1984, CJAV increased its transmission power to 1000 watts day and night, and in early 1987, the station began broadcasting 24 hours a day, with overnight programming coming from the Toronto-based Satellite Radio Network. On June 25, 2004, CJAV was purchased by Central Island Broadcasting Ltd. (now Island Radio). On April 18, 2005, Island Radio received approval from the CRTC Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2005-160 to switch CJAV over to the FM band at 93.3 MHz with operating power of 6000 watts; the switch took place on September 2 (with simulcasting on its old 1240 AM frequency continuing until early December) and the station adopted its current mixed format of adult contemporary music and active rock. On June 22, original CJAV owner Harold Warren died at age 90. On November 1, 2005, Pattison and Island Radio announced that Island Radio Ltd. of Nanaimo, B.C. had agreed to sell its six radio stations (and related assets) to the Jim Pattison Broadcast Group. The stations involved in the transaction include CJAV, CKWV and CHWF in Nanaimo, CIBH and CHPQ in Parksville-Qualicum Beach and CKLR in Courtenay. With the approval of the CRTC, Jim Pattison assumed ownership of the Island Radio stations (including CJAV) at midnight on June 30, 2006. On April 1, 2006 CJAV (The Peak) celebrated its 60th anniversary serving the Alberni Valley. Recent well wishers calling into the station included BC Premier Gordon Campbell, BC Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo, Port Alberni-born \\"Man In Motion\\" Rick Hansen, legendary CKNW broadcaster Jim Robson, and Port Alberni mayor Ken McRae. In 2014 afternoon host Jolie McMullan departed the station for a position at the Alberni Valley Bulldogs.

It is a part of the Waco Independent School District located in central McLennan County. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Improvement Required\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  History  The first home of Waco High School, or Central High as it was then called, was on the lot at Fourth and Webster streets in the early 1880s. There were two buildings, and one had formerly been the Episcopal church with the bell still in the tower. This was the only public school building west of the Brazos. In 1886-1887, these were replaced by a brick building, and in 1911, at Thanksgiving time, the new building on Columbus Avenue was ready for occupancy. Since then wings have been added to it and a building constructed as an auditorium and gymnasium. The old Baker residence, across the street, was purchased in 1942 for the use of bands and orchestras. In the 1970s, it moved to a new location on the corner of North 19th and College Drive, which is now the campus of McLennan Community College. In 1986, Waco High was consolidated with Jefferson-Moore High School and Richfield High School. The new school at the former Richfield campus on North 42nd Street used the Waco High name, but incorporated aspects of the other two schools into its identity. The lion mascot was adopted from Jefferson-Moore and the school colors (scarlet, white, and gray) were taken from Richfield. With the merger, Waco High was classified as a UIL Class 5A school. It moved down to the second-highest classification, Class 4A, in 2006. (Class 4A was then renamed Class 5A beginning in the fall of 2014.)

The Tigers won state titles in 1922, 1925, 1926, and 1927, with runner-up finishes in 1923, 1924, and 1939. In 1927, Waco High had one of the most dominant seasons in Texas high school football history. The Tigers scored an average of 56 points per game (a record that would stand until 1975, when Big Sandy scored 824 points in 14 games) while giving up only 2.4 points per game to its opponents. On two occasions Waco High scored more than 100 points, once in a playoff game versus Houston Davis. Roy Needham, Davis' coach, said \\"Waco could have beaten a good college team\\" that day. During that same 1927 season, Waco High was recognized as the mythical national high school champion after defeating Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin High School of Chardon, Ohio in a postseason game, 44-12. In the spring of 1942, the Waco school board suddenly and unanimously voted to fire Tyson after an 8-2 season, two years removed from a year he took the Tigers to the state finals. Tyson, a lifelong bachelor who never dated, was rumored to be \\"too intimate\\" with his players. Waco High won two more state titles after Tyson. In 1945, they shared the championship with Highland Park after the title game ended in a 7-7 tie, and won outright in 1948, when the Tigers beat Amarillo, 21-0. Modern era Under coach Johnny Tusa, who coached at Jefferson-Moore from 1979-1985 and Waco High from 1986-2009, Waco made the playoffs in 1986-88, 1990–92, 1994–2002, and 2004–2006. In 1991, Waco High had its longest run in the Class 5A playoffs, five rounds deep to the state semifinals. The Lions lost to the famed Odessa Permian team before a sellout crowd at Ratliff Stadium in Odessa, 37-8. The Lions beat Austin Crockett, Conroe McCullough (now The Woodlands), Richardson Berkner, and Dallas Carter in the previous four rounds. In 2006, Waco High was classified a Class 4A school and placed in District 16-4A by the UIL. The district contained fellow former 5A rival Copperas Cove, plus Brownwood, Killeen, and Waco-area schools University and Midway. The Lions won the district title with a perfect record that year. Waco High made another deep playoff run, defeating Corsicana, Dallas Hillcrest, Whitehouse, Brownwood, and Wolfforth Frenship to advance to the Class 4A Division II state championship game at the Alamodome in San Antonio. The Lions lost to La Marque, 36-14. In 2007, Waco High put together another undefeated district run for the 16-4A title, with its only loss in non-district to Euless Trinity. The Lions lost in the first round of the playoffs in four overtimes to Ennis. In 2008, the team made the playoffs and lost to Lancaster in bi-district. Before the 2009 season, head coach Johnny Tusa retired after a 31-year head coaching career in Waco ISD. The district hired offensive coordinator Danny Ramsey from Cypress Creek High School as head coach, who converted the team's long-time traditional power running offense into a triple spread option. That year, the team went 2-8 and tied its worst record ever. Despite another losing record in 2010, the Lions returned to the playoffs, falling in the second round to eventual state champion Aledo. Waco High posted a winning record in 2011, but lost to Mansfield Summit in the first round of the playoffs. In 2012, under new head coach Marty Herbst, a longtime assistant under Tusa, the Lions went three rounds deep in the playoffs, losing to Wolfforth Frenship. Another loss to an eventual state champion, Denton Guyer, ended Waco High's 2013 season in the second round of the playoffs.  Facilities  Waco ISD Stadium was built in 2000 and replaced the historic 10,000-seat Paul Tyson Stadium located behind Waco High School on Lake Air Drive. (Tyson Stadium is still in use for some football games and track events.) The new stadium is located at the corner of New Road and Bagby Avenue in Waco, approximately half a mile from I-35. The first game played at the stadium was Waco High vs. University High on September 8, 2000. Waco High won the game, 22-0, in front of a crowd estimated at 14,000.

It is an adaptable and numerous species, with bold and noisy habits. It is related to the more localized black-winged and Senegal lapwings, with which it shares some plumage characteristics. Taxonomy The crowned lapwing was described by the French polymath Georges- Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François- Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Charadrius coronatus in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The crowned lapwing is now placed in the genus Vanellus that was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The generic name Vanellus is the Medieval Latin for a \\"lapwing\\". It is a diminutive of the Latin vanus meaning \\"winnowing\\" or \\"fan\\". The specific epithet coronatus is Latin for \\"crowned\\". Three subspecies are recognised: * V. c. demissus (Friedmann, 1928) – north Somalia * V. c. coronatus (Boddaert, 1783) – Ethiopia and east Africa to Zambia and South Africa * V. c. xerophilus Clancey, 1960 – southwest Angola to west South Africa and west Zimbabwe Description Close-up of a bird in Johannesburg The crowned lapwing is easily recognized by its combination of brown and white colours, with most tellingly, a black crown intersected by an annular white halo. Adults are noisy and conspicuous. Males measure on average 3% larger than females. Juveniles are dull versions of adults, vermiculated on the wings and mantle, the legs yellowy rather than red and the bill lacking the red base. Habitat and numbers Crowned lapwings prefer short, dry grassland which may be overgrazed or burnt, but avoid mountains. In higher- rainfall areas such as parts of Zambia and Zimbabwe, they occur mainly as dry- season visitors. In dry regions of northern Botswana, however, they are attracted in large numbers when good rainfall occurs. In southern Africa their highest concentrations are to be found in the dry central Kalahari region. Although generally outnumbered by blacksmith lapwings, they are the most widespread and locally the most numerous lapwing species in their area of distribution. Their numbers have increased in the latter part of the 20th century after benefiting from a range of human activities. They live up to 20 years. The crowned lapwing is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Behaviour Crowned lapwings and the more localized black-winged lapwings sometimes associate and do not show mutual aggression, even within breeding territories. Different crowned lapwing males do however posture aggressively when nesting territories are established. The loser in an encounter assumes a special posture to signal his defeat. Bare-part colours of males brighten in the breeding season. Different types of display flights lure the female to the defended territory. A female accepting the male and territory will follow the male during his display flight. Mates may be retained for life. Egg-laying is timed to precede the rainy season and most incubating is done by the female. The male assists only on hot days, when he either incubates or shades the nest. Food Their diet consists of a variety of insects, but termites form an important component.

Kirshner has worked in several areas of astronomy including the physics of supernovae, supernova remnants, the large-scale structure of the cosmos, and the use of supernovae to measure the expansion of the universe. Career Kirshner received his A.B. magna cum laude in Astronomy from Harvard College in 1970, where he also won a Bowdoin Prize for Useful and Polite Literature. He earned his Ph.D., also in Astronomy, from Caltech in 1975. He then worked as a postdoc at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, before joining the faculty at the University of Michigan, where he rose to become Professor and Chairman of the Astronomy Department and helped to build the 2.4 meter Hiltner Telescope. Whilst at Michigan, he received an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship and won the Henry Russel Award. In 1985, he moved to the Harvard Astronomy Department as Professor of Astronomy (1985–2016), where he served as Chairman of the Department from 1990-1997 and as the head of the Optical and Infrared Division of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. from 1997-2003.

Published in 1888, it was the first modern Hindi novel. It gained a cult following, and contributed to the popularity of the Hindi language. The copyright on the novel expired in 1964 and it is now in public domain, along with other titles by the author. It inspired Nirja Guleri's mega-budget TV serial of the same name (though the screenplay had many differences from the novel) which became one of the biggest-ever blockbusters in the history of Indian television. Story The story is a romantic fantasy about two lovers who belong to rival kingdoms: the princess Chandrakanta of Vijaygarh, and the prince Virendra Singh of Naugarh. Krur Singh, a member of the Vijaygarh king's court dreams of marrying Chandrakanta and taking over the throne. When Krur Singh fails in his endeavor, he flees the kingdom and befriends Shivdutt, the powerful neighboring king of Chunargarh ( referring to the fort in Chunar that inspired Khatri to write the novel). Krur Singh coaxes Shivdutt to ensnare Chandrakanta at any cost. Shivdutt captures Chandrakanta and while running away from Shivdutt, Chandrakanta finds herself a prisoner in a tilism. After that Kunvar Virendra Singh breaks the tilism and fights with Shivdutt with the help of aiyyars. The Story slowly unfolds into Chandrakanta being kidnapped and getting rescued by Chapla. However, they get trapped into a Tilism by a quirk of fate. Prince Virender Singh starts breaking the Tilism to free Chandrakanta. The Story unfolds around the efforts of Virender Singh for breaking Tilism and King Shivdutt trying to stop him to do the deed himself. Chandrakanta, the novel, has many sequels, prominent being a 7-book series (Chandrakanta santati) dealing with the adventures of Chandrakanta and Virendra Singh's children in another major tilism. Chandrakanta Santati and Bhootnath are one of the finest fantasy books ever written in India. Tilism and Aiyyars Chandrakanta is notable for introducing the concepts of \\"Aiyyar\\" and \\"Tilism\\" to Hindi literature.  Aiyyar/Aiyyara  According to Devaki nandan Khatri, An Aiyyar (male) or Aiyyara (female) is a secret agent spy fighter. He or she is expert in many arts like: * Disguise * Fighting skills * Spying * Science * Fine arts * Medical * Chemistry Disguise is must (Aiyyar/a may change him/herself into person of same or even of opposite sex but of resembling body built, by makeup). Fighting skills are also must, for self-defence. An Aiyyar/a always overpowers any small group of ordinary soldiers. He/she may need to spy for taking out some secrets or for finding some missing persons. Knowledge of science and fine arts is also necessary, as it may come handy many times. Medical knowledge, and specially that of Anaesthesia is needed for him/her. Chemical knowledge is also needed In a nutshell an Aiyyar is a Jack of all trades. But contrary to common belief, Khatrian Aiyyar/a are unfamiliar with magic and spells. He/she may join into any king's or landlord's service or may remain free. The items must for an Aiyyar/a: Kamand (a long very strong cord used to climb over building secretly, or for tying opposite Aiyyar/a or captured person/s) Batua or purse (used to keep necessary medicines, makeup items, money and dry fruits) Lakhlakha must also be in the 'Batua' (lakhlakha is a kind of smelling salt used to revive any unconscious person) Khanjar or dagger (for safety and for attack) Langot or short smart pants are usually worn by male Aiyyars when in easy mood Ethics of Aiyyars: Never kill or torture any other Aiyyar/a (but can arrest him/her) Never cheat your master Never attack too many Aiyyars over a single person The novel depicts a number of friendly and unfriendly Aiyyar. Aiyyars on the side of Virendrasingh include: * Tej Singh * Jeet Singh (Tej Singh's father) * Devi Singh; Aiyyars on the side of Chandrakanta: * Chapla * Champa Aiyyars on the side of Krur singh: * Nazim * Ahmed * Aamir Aiyyars on the side of Shivdutt (all except last two later joined the Virendra Singh's side): * Pandit Badrinath * Chunnilal * Pandit Jagannath * Pannalal * Ramnarayan * Ghasita Singh * Bhagwan Dutt Later on in Chandrakanta Santati, many more Aiyyars were introduced, including mainly: * Bhootnath * Nanak * Bhairo Singh (Tej Singh's son) * Tara Singh (Devi Singh's son) * Indra Dev * Kamla (Bhootnath's Daughter) * Kamini * Sher Singh * Kamalini * Ladili * Dhanpati * Tara (not to be confused with Tara Sing) * Harnam Singh (only name in this epic allotted to two totally different characters) * Bihari Singh * Raja Gopal Singh * Laxmi Devi * Mayarani Adaptations Chandrakanta was made into a television serial in the mid-1990s by its creator, writer, producer and director Nirja Guleri and this mega-budget serial went on to become one of the blockbusters on Indian television. The serial also introduced many new characters. A new serial named Kahani Chandrakanta Ki was started in 2011 on Sahara One TV Channel, Based on his next novel in Chandrakanta series named Chandrakanta Santati (story about Chandrakanta's sons) by the director Sunil Agnihotri, with same degree of deviations from the original Devki Nandan Khatri novel. The story of Chandrakanta Santati was much different from the story shown by new TV serial Kahani Chandrakanta Ki. Subsequently, it failed to attract viewership and finally was cancelled. Indian filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra tried producing a film adaptation of the book, which was to be directed by Ram Madhvani. The film was to have been titled Taalismaan and included Amitabh Bachchan among the cast, playing an Aiyyar. Abhishek Bachchan was to be seen in this screen adaption of the tale of Chandrakanta. The film was never made. In 2017, two more TV adaptations were planned. The one on the channel Life Ok and titled Prem Ya Paheli – Chandrakanta again tries to retell the story. Unfortunately,the ending was not shown because the channel changed from Life Ok to Star Bharat. Colors TV also started a TV show with the name Chandrakanta. Its story is totally different from the original novel. It was produced by Ekta Kapoor.

Porro Album Cover, The Phonograph, 1948-1970. The porro is a musical style and dance from the Caribbean region of Colombia. It is a Colombian cumbia rhythm that developed into its own subgenre. It was originally a folkloric expression from the Sinú River area that evolved into a ballroom dance. It is played mostly by brass bands or orchestras, and danced in couples. This genere influenced some of the greatest Latin American Bands of the 60's, with songs such as \\"Pachito E'ché\\" (originally from Wolfgang Alejandro Tovar García, then interpreted by Benny Moré), \\"Se va el Caimán\\", and \\"Me voy pa'Cataca\\" (originally from José María Peñaranda, then interpreted by La Sonora Matancera.) Types The two types of folkloric porro are porro palitiao and porro tapao. Porro palitiao The term \\"palitiao\\" is derived from the way the bombo drum is struck along its rim to produce the sound of a cowbell. This type of porro is associated with the Sinú River, and its surrounding cities and towns. Most would agree on San Pelayo, Colombia, Córdoba as its place of birth. This is the reason why it can also take the name of porro pelayero. In orchestrated variants, porro palitiao or pelayero is known as gaita. See La Sonora Cordobesa and Pacho Galán for exemplary orro palitiao and gaita music. Porro tapao The porro tapao is associated with the savannas around Cartagena, Colombia. Its birthplace is believed to be the town of El Carmen de Bolívar, Colombia. In orchestrated forms, this type of porro is called porro sabanero. See Lucho Bermúdez or Toto La Momposina for samples of porro sabanero. In contemporary culture Today, orchestrated porro has lost the widespread popularity it had during the 1940s-1970s in Colombia. However, since the 1980s in Medellín, Colombia, the genre has seen a revived interest among younger audiences. Dozens of schools in the city specialize in teaching porro moves as well as mambo, pasodoble, tango, and chachachá) where participants learn complex turns to compositions by such artists as Lucho Bermúdez and Pacho Galán.

The film, which has no dialogue, stars Kamal Haasan, Amala and Tinnu Anand with Sameer Khakhar, K. S. Ramesh, Loknath, Pratap K. Pothen, P. L. Narayana, Farida Jalal and Ramya in supporting roles. It revolves around an unemployed graduate who encounters a drunk millionaire unconscious and takes over his lifestyle after keeping him prisoner. However, he does not realise the dangers he has brought upon himself because a hired hitman believes him to be his target. Rao's desire to make a dialogue-less film came when he was working as an assistant director in a film where a character had to emote fear without dialogue in a scene. Once the idea for Pushpaka Vimana materialised, Rao wrote the screenplay within two weeks. The film was the only one produced by Nagaraj. Due to the lack of dialogue, Rao was able to cast actors from different parts of India. Cinematography was handled by B. C. Gowrishankar, editing by D. Vasu, art direction by Thota Tharani and the background score was composed by L. Vaidyanathan. The film was shot in Bangalore. The film was released on 27 November 1987 with different titles for different regions: its original title Pushpaka Vimana in Karnataka, Pushpak () in Hindi-speaking regions, Pesum Padam () in Tamil Nadu, Pushpaka Vimanamu in Andhra Pradesh and Pushpakvimanam in Kerala. It received critical acclaim and became a commercial success, with a 35-week theatrical run in Bangalore. The film later won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and in three categories at the 35th Filmfare Awards South: Best Film, Best Director – Kannada (Rao) and Best Actor – Kannada (Haasan).  Plot  An unemployed graduate living in a ramshackle lodge called Anand Bhavan dreams of riches. While in a shop, he meets a girl trying on earrings, and sees her again when he appears for a vacancy. One day, the graduate finds a drunk millionaire unconscious by the roadside. On finding the key to a suite in a plush five-star hotel named \\"Pushpak\\" in his pocket, the graduate carries the millionaire to his room at Anand Bhavan, keeps him prisoner there with the help of forced doses of alcohol, then moves to the millionaire's suite at Pushpak to take over his lifestyle. The millionaire's wife has a secret lover, who hires a hitman to kill the millionaire without her knowledge. The hitman, who has never seen the millionaire, believes the graduate is his target, based on the suite where he stays. The graduate learns that the girl is at the same hotel, and is the daughter of a magician. She slaps him after mistaking him for pulling a prank on her, but after the hotel owner suddenly dies, the two meet while paying tribute at his funeral and mend ways. They gradually get into a romantic relationship. All the while, the hitman tries to kill the graduate with ice daggers, but fails on every attempt. The graduate remains unaware about the threat to his life. Eventually he realises that the hitman is in the hotel to kill someone, but cannot find the identity of his target. Later the hitman intrudes into his suite and gets electrocuted while trying to stab the graduate from behind, but survives. Followed by the graduate, the hitman returns to the lover's bungalow and informs him about his failure. The graduate learns the complete truth. The hitman realises he was targeting the wrong man all along. At this time, the millionaire's wife learns of her lover's treachery and breaks up with him. In a montage shown about the hotel owner, the graduate realises that he was a poor man, just like him. Seeing what the hotel owner achieved by fair means, the graduate begins to question his actions. Some time later, a roadside beggar dies and municipality people come to take his cadaver. However, seeing the beggar's stash, they abandon his body and start taking the money. The graduate decides to make things right. He sets the millionaire free and explains the situation to him in a letter. The millionaire and his wife reunite and he stops drinking. After that, the graduate decides to come clean to the magician's daughter as well. He learns that the magician and his family are about to leave Pushpak. The graduate confesses the truth to the magician's daughter, but to his surprise she forgives him. While leaving Pushpak, she writes something on a paper and drops a rose wrapped in the same paper from her car for the graduate to pick up. The graduate obtains the rose, but before he can obtain the paper, a gust of wind rolls it into a gutter. Some time later, the graduate is shown standing in a long queue of job seekers.  Cast  * Kamal Haasan as the unemployed graduate * Amala as the magician's daughter * Tinnu Anand as the hitman * Sameer Khakhar as the millionaire * K. S. Ramesh as the magician * Loknath as the hotel owner * Pratap K. Pothen as the lover of the millionaire's wife * P. L. Narayana as the beggar * Farida Jalal as the magician's wife *Ramya as the millionaire's wife  Production   Development  Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was an assistant director to K. V. Reddy, in a film where there was a scene requiring a character to emote fear without dialogues. Rao wondered, \\"Why not do a whole film this way?!\\" and this thought haunted him for a long time, but he had no \\"idea about the story and other aspects of such a film\\". The idea for the film that would become Pushpaka Vimana came to Rao when he was in a shower, after which he wrote the screenplay within two weeks. Kamal Haasan agreed to work on the film after being impressed by the script. Pushpaka Vimana thus became the first full-length dialogue-less film in India after the \\"silent era\\" of cinema. The film however struggled to find a producer, prompting Rao to take over production himself. When Kannada actor Shringar Nagaraj, a relative of Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar with whom Rao was working at that time, heard that Rao was producing a film on his own, he asked about the subject. Rao narrated Pushpaka Vimana, Nagaraj showed excitement and joined as co-producer, with the film being produced under Mandakani Chitra, a Bangalore based company. Pushpaka Vimana was the only film he had produced in his entire career. Cinematography was handled by B. C. Gowrishankar, editing by D. Vasu, and art direction by Thota Tharani, who had worked with Rao on Raja Paarvai (1981).  Casting  Since the film had no dialogue, Rao chose to cast actors from different parts of India. Haasan, a native of Tamil Nadu, was cast as the protagonist, an unemployed graduate. He had to shave his signature moustache for the role. Rao initially wanted Neelam Kothari to be the female lead, but she wanted to wear \\"glittering costumes\\" like in typical Bollywood films; hence, Rao did not cast her. After seeing Amala compere an awards function at Chennai, enquiring about her and getting to know about her Kalakshetra background, he approached her and she accepted. Initially, Rao approached Amrish Puri to portray the hitman, but he could not accept the offer due to unavailability of dates. Haasan's then-wife Sarika showed a photograph of Tinnu Anand and successfully recommended him for the role. Ramya played the drunk millionaire's wife. Telugu actor P. L. Narayana was cast as the beggar and Sameer Khakhar as the drunk millionaire. Pratap K. Pothen, then known mainly for portraying dark characters, portrayed a comical character, the extramarital lover of Ramya's character. Rao initially wanted Bengali magician P. C. Sorcar to portray the female lead's magician father, but ultimately chose K. S. Ramesh after seeing his performance in a magic show on television in Bangalore, where the story is set. Farida Jalal, who was then visiting Bangalore, was cast as the female lead's mother. Loknath appeared as the owner of the hotel where the story is set.  Filming  Thota Tharani constructed a street set for the film beside the Hyland Hotel in Bangalore. The ramshackle room where the graduate lives, and the building itself, was constructed above the hotel. Most of the shooting was done in the Windsor Manor hotel in Bangalore. The management of Windsor Manor were not initially willing to let the film be shot there, but after Nagaraj told them that \\"the entire world will know about this hotel after the film\\", they agreed. The scenes where the graduate meets the beggar were shot at a bridge near Windsor Manor. As Ramesh was not as old as his character, Rao \\"made him look old\\". The hitman's signature weapon is an ice dagger. For this reason, every night, an ice mould in the shape of a dagger was kept in the freezer; however, the ice dagger would often melt soon by morning because of the strong density lights being used in the shooting. Rao ultimately decided to use an acrylic dagger, which looked like an actual ice dagger. The entire budget of the film was .  Music  The film had no songs, only background score. Rao wanted a composer who could work as per his demands and requirements for the scenes, for this L. Vaidyanathan was chosen to compose the score. Sitar exponent Janardhan Mitta contributed to the re-recording using two other instruments apart from minimal orchestration.  Themes  Rao called Pushpaka Vimana a personal film because \\"that's the life I lead. I don't want to amass wealth. At the same time, I am not a person who romanticises poverty. Money is important, but that is not everything.\\" Anjana Shekar of The News Minute said the film satirises unemployment, an issue that was prevalent in India in the 1980s. She compared it to Mark Twain's novel The Prince and the Pauper because of the concept of identity switching, with the difference being that in Pushpaka Vimana the switching is not mutually agreed upon and the two men do not look alike. Anjana said that the climax in which the graduate is shown standing in a long queue of job seekers indicates that nothing has changed for him \\"except that now, he's willing to take the metaphorical stairs to succeed in life.\\" Historian Bhagwan Das Garga noted similarities between the graduate and Walter Mitty, because of how the former \\"fantasises about riches\\". Writing for India Today, Madhu Jain described Pushpaka Vimana as \\"the story of the modern Indian male Cinderella. But with a different end – and moral: Money is not everything though pursuing it is entertaining.\\" She noted the contrast in the name of the graduate's lodge, Anand Bhavan (Abode of Bliss). Film critic Naman Ramachandran said the film gives the message that \\"money is the root of much evil and honesty is the best policy\\". Ravi Balakrishnan of The Economic Times said that though it eschews formulaic Indian cinema conventions like songs and dialogue, it has \\"all the elements that make a great mainstream entertainer – a love story, a crime caper, a thriller and a comedy – with plotlines blending together seamlessly\\", while comparing its primary narrative to Charlie Chaplin's City Lights (1931), the graduate to Chaplin's character The Tramp, and the millionaire to Khakar's drunkard character Khopdi from the Hindi television series Nukkad.  Release  Pushpaka Vimana was released on 27 November 1987. The film was released under different titles for different regions: its original title Pushpaka Vimana in Karnataka, Pushpaka Vimanamu in Andhra Pradesh, Pesum Padam in Tamil Nadu, Pushpak for Hindi-speaking regions and Pushpakvimanam in Kerala. In Andhra Pradesh, it was distributed by Sravanthi Ravi Kishore, in Mumbai by actor Rajendra Kumar, and in Chennai by editor A. Mohan.  Reception  The film received critical acclaim for its creativity, making and the cast performances. Reviewing Pesum Padam, the magazine Ananda Vikatan said that to make a silent film needs a lot of courage and the filmmaker needs to be congratulated for that, rating it 50 out of 100. N. Krishnaswamy of The Indian Express said, \\"For [Kamal Haasan], the film is yet another achievement. For Singeetam, always the bold experimenter [...] Pesum Padam should provide both critical and commercial mileage. It is music director L. Vaidyanathan's task to provide the 'silent' film a worthy musical foil to match its varied moods and needs: this he does with panache.\\" Filmmaker Satyajit Ray applauded the film and told Rao, \\"You have created a love scene around a dead body\\", referring to the scene where the graduate and the magician's daughter walk around the hotel owner's body during his funeral several times just to spend some time together. Bombay: The City Magazines critic wrote, \\"Pushpak is a bold and timely reminder that verbal diarrhoea drowns out meaning. Silence is not only golden but eloquent.\\" Though no-one expected the film to succeed, it was a sleeper hit, completing a 35-week theatrical run in Bangalore, and grossing around according to estimates by Madhu Jain and Garga.  Accolades  At the 35th National Film Awards, Pushpaka Vimana won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It also won in three categories at the 35th Filmfare Awards South: Best Film, Filmfare Award for Best Director – Kannada (Rao) and Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Kannada (Haasan). At the 1987–88 Karnataka State Film Awards, the film won in the categories of Best Editor (Vasu), Best Music Director (Vaidyanathan) and Karnataka State Jury's Special Award (Rao). The film premiered at the International Film Festival of India, 1988 Cannes Film Festival in the International Critics' Week, and retrospective at the Shanghai International Film Festival, and Whistling Woods International.  Legacy  Pushpaka Vimanam became a landmark of Indian cinema. According to film theorists Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, it \\"helped change [Kamal Haasan's] screen image.\\" Rao has stated that after the film's success, many people wanted him to make more dialogue-less films but he was uninterested, saying, \\"My fascination was for the first one that I made.\\" Amala listed it along with Vedham Pudhithu (1987), Agni Natchathiram (1988), Siva (1989) and Karpoora Mullai (1991) as her most memorable films. The film is listed among CNN-News18's \\"hundred greatest Indian films of all time\\". It was also listed by Rediff.com in its list \\"Singeetham's gems before Christ\\". On Haasan's birthday, 7 November 2015, Latha Srinivasan of Daily News and Analysis considered Pushpaka Vimanam to be one of the \\"films you must watch to grasp the breadth of Kamal Haasan's repertoire\\".

It has been used by artists like Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Christoph Graupner to signify that the work was produced for the sake of praising God. The phrase has become one of the five solae propounded to summarise the Reformers' basic beliefs during the Protestant Reformation. As a greeting, it was used by monks in cistercian and trappist monastic orders in written comunication. As a doctrine, it means that everything is done for God's glory to the exclusion of mankind's self-glorification and pride. Christians are to be motivated and inspired by God's glory and not their own. Meaning and related terms The three words ' (abbreviated S. D. G.) have meaning in Latin as follows: soli is the (irregular) dative singular of the adjective \\"lone\\", \\"sole\\", and agrees with the dative singular Deo, (in the nominative dictionary form Deus), meaning \\"to God\\"; and gloria is the nominative case of \\"glory\\", \\"gloria\\". ' is usually translated glory to God alone, The Routledge dictionary of Latin quotations: the illiterati's guide to Latin maxims, mottoes, proverbs and sayings, Jon R. Stone, Routledge, 2005 p. 207 but some translate it glory to the only God. A similar phrase is found in the Vulgate translation of the Bible: \\"\\". This is grammatically the same as the signature of Bach and Handel, but using the dative \\"to the only God\\" then two nominative subjects \\"honour and glory.\\" The verse reads differently in Greek and English because of the additional adjective \\"wise\\": , aphthartôi, aoratôi, mónōi, sophôi Theôi—\\"to the immortal, invisible, unique, wise God.\\" Musical and literary usage G. F. Handel manuscript The Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the initials \\"S. D. G.\\" at the end of all his church compositions and also applied it to some, but not all, his secular works. This dedication was at times also used by Bach's contemporary George Frideric Handel, e.g. in his Te Deum. The 16th century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross used the similar phrase, Soli Deo honor et gloria, in his Precautions and Counsels. In tribute to Bach, the term was also chosen by Sir John Eliot Gardiner as the name for his own record label after leaving Archiv Produktion, to continue and complete his Bach cantatas project. Aaron Shust's 2009 song \\"To God Alone (be the Glory)\\" was inspired by Bach's writing \\"S.D.G.\\" at the bottom of his musical scores. Protestant usage in the Five Solae Together with sola fide, sola gratia, sola scriptura and solus Christus, the phrase has become part of what is known as the Five Solae, a summary statement of central tenets of the Protestant Reformation.Reformed Theology, by R.

The Kernel Transaction Manager intends to make it easy for application developers to do much error recovery, virtually transparently, with KTM acting as a transaction manager that transaction clients can plug into. Those transaction clients can be third-party clients that want to initiate transactions on resources that are managed by Transaction Resource Manager.

The campus is directly on a beach on central California's Monterey Bay, which is the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The address is 783 San Andreas Road, west of Watsonville, California and California State Route 1.Monterey Bay Academy Frequently Asked Questions from MBA's website  Type of School  MBA is a co-educational, Christian highschool for boarding and day students. The academic program is college preparatory, with seniors expected to be accepted into 4-year colleges. It is owned and operated by the Central California Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, part of a network of more than 5,000 educational facilities. Monterey Bay Academy is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Adventist Accreditation Association.  Electives and activities  MBA offers elective classes from Marine Biology to Woodworking to Fine Art and advanced placement classes in United States History and English Literature. Offerings are based on the entrance requirements of the University of California. Popular student activities are music, sports programs and extra-curricular trips and tours. Some students enjoy surfing or boogie boarding on the beach, other sports include soccer, basketball, or skateboarding. Many students are involved with student government, community service, or outreach projects. Most students in the dormitory have a roommate and each dorm has at least two full-time adult supervisors. Academics The required curriculum includes classes in the following subject areas: Religion, English, Oral Communications, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, Health, Computer Applications, Fine Arts, and Electives. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement.  History of MBA  In 1938, the National Guard relocated the 250th Coast Artillery Regiment to the present MBA site. Named in memory of military chaplain Joseph P. McQuaide, Camp McQuaide was the coastal artillery training center for World War II and became the official stockade for army deserters. After ten years Camp McQuaide was decommissioned and considered surplus. In 1948, the government tried unsuccessfully to sell the property to Santa Cruz County for $1 as site of a junior college, and to the California Department of Parks and Recreation for a state park. Leal Grunke, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor from Chowchilla, California, was the procurement officer for the Central California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. When he saw the location for the first time, he proposed using it for a boarding school. He met opposition from church officials, and then from the government. Grunke made several trips from Chowchilla to the War Assets Administration in San Francisco to meet with the general who was considering selling the property to private land developers. With the help of John P. Gifford of the United States Department of Education, Grunke convinced the War Assets Administration to give the land to the Seventh-day Adventist Church on August 13, 1948. No money was paid, not even the $1 asked of Santa Cruz County earlier that year. A condition was that the Church develop the school laid out in its proposal. Despite the pristine location, the remains of the camp included acres of cement and 600 old buildings. Monterey Bay Academy did not start out as an aesthetically pleasing campus. Despite being called \\"Grunke’s Folly\\", the school was established in 1949. The school's motto \\"Where land and sea unite to inspire\\", was created by Grunke's wife Ruth, while the school's name was chosen by Grunke. Since 1949, Monterey Bay Academy served more than 8,000 students with 95% going to college. As a part of the world's largest Protestant school system MBA has grown and modernized.

He is credited with the development of approaches and tools in validation of estimates and measurements. Introduction of fuzzy logic in the context of validation is often considered to be the most significant contribution to the field of model and method validation (Agronomy Journal, volume 94, pages 1222–1233 ; Food Analytical Methods, volume 2, pages 126-135 ). He also helped spark the validation issues in agro-ecological modelling and analytical methods through his reviews of specialistic literature. His approach to the aggregation of multiple validation metrics has influenced the way validation results are viewed. In this respect he is credited with the establishment of hierarchy of preferences in validation and classification of models and methods in terms of aggregated, weighted metrics.  Biography  Gianni Bellocchi was born in Acquapendente and spent formative years in San Lorenzo Nuovo, in province of Viterbo (Italy), near Lago di Bolsena. His parents, Giuseppe (born 1944) and Adriana (born 1946), are retired farmers. He attended at primary and middle schools in his village, and at agricultural high school in Bagnoregio. Starting in 1988, he studied agricultural sciences at the University of Pisa and at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa. He graduated in 1993 and got a PhD in 1997. He learned statistical data processing and modelling approaches from entomologist Fabio Quaglia, physicist Franco Martorana, and modellers Frits W.T. Penning de Vries (Wageningen University, Netherlands) and Claudio O. Stockle (Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, U.S.). Gianni joined the staff of agronomy and agro- meteorology modelers of the Research Institute for Industrial Crops of Bologna in 1999, and developed a large number of scientific contributions under the leaderhsip of Marcello Donatelli. In 2006–2009 he was appointed contractual agent at European Commission - Joint Research Centre of Ispra, Italy. In 2010, he became senior scientist at French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), Grassland Ecosystem Research Unit (UREP) and, as of February 1, 2014, research director. In 2011, January 25, he got the Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches from Blaise Pascal University of Clermont-Ferrand (France). He joined as member of the Italian Society for Agronomy, the European Society for Agronomy, the American Society of Agronomy, and the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society. As affiliated to the Monte Pino Met European Research Observatory, he is co-editor of the book \\"Storminess and Environmental Change\\" (Diodato and Bellocchi, 2014, Springer). He coordinated in 2013-2016 the project MODEXTREME of the 7th Framework Programme funded by the European Union.  Model and method validation  Bellocchi's work in validation has had implications for model and analytical method assessment. Genuine insights in model results, as well as results from an analytical method, imply concomitant understandings of multiple aspects of quality assessment to be taken into account and formalized. The fuzzy set theory formalized by Professor Lofti Zadeh at the University of California in 1965 was pointed out as having a direct use to assess numerical outcomes for its ability to aggregate multiple, possibly contradictory, evaluation measures. Many of the more basic principles of this theory are now generally accepted in many areas. Its application in a context of validation opened up to a new way to investigate results from a modelling process or an analytical method. In 2001, Bellocchi and co-workers firstly introduced the possibility to use fuzzy logic to evaluate model estimates at the Second International Symposium on Modelling Cropping Systems (Florence, Italy), and in 2002 the same approach was internationally acknowledged (Agronomy Journal, volume 94, pages 1222–1233). Further extensions and applications followed (as reported in Authorship).  Fuzzy logic   Multiple-metric aggregation  The procedure based on the multi-valued fuzzy set introduced by Professor Lofti Zadeh, follows the Sugeno method of fuzzy inference (Information Sciences, volume 36, pages 59–83 ). Three membership classes are basically defined for all metrics used in the validation work, according to an expert judgment, i.e. Favorable (F), Unfavorable (U), and partial (or fuzzy) membership, using S-shaped curves as transition possibilities in the range F to U: S(x;a;b)=\\\\begin{cases}0 & x \\\\le a\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\left(x-a\\\\right)^2\\\\times 2}{\\\\left(b-a\\\\right)^2} & a \\\\le x \\\\le c\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-\\\\frac{\\\\left(b-x\\\\right)^2\\\\times 2}{\\\\left(b-a\\\\right)^2} & c \\\\le x \\\\le b\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & b\\\\le x\\\\end{cases} where: x = the value of the basic input; a = the lower bound of the transition interval [min(F, U)]; b = the upper bound of the transition interval [max(F, U)]; c = (a + b) /2. According to the equation, if a = F, then x ≤ a means x = F, and S(x;a;b) gives the degree of membership of the index value x to the set U. Its complement, 1 - S(x;a;b), gives the degree of membership of the index value x to the set F. A two-stage design of a fuzzy-based rules' inferring system is applied where firstly inputs with similar characteristics are aggregated into modules and then, using the same procedure, the modules can be aggregated into a second level integrated index called indicator. Both modules and indicator range from 0 to 1. The control rules for estimating module values are based on logic relationships between inputs and outputs, expressed in linguistic terms by 'if-then' statements. For example, when two input variables (validation metrics) are aggregated four rules are required, formalized as: ____PREMISE____CONCLUSION if x1 is F and x2 is F then yi is B1 if x1 is F and x2 is U then y2 is B2 if x1 is U and x2 is F then y3 is B3 if x1 is U and x2 is U then y4 is B4 where xi is an input variable, yi is an output variable and Bi is a conclusion (or expert weight). The value of each conjunction (… and …) is the minimum of the quantified fuzzy groups, which are obtained from complementary S-shaped distribution curves. The output fuzzy sets for all the rules are then aggregated into a single fuzzy set. This group encompasses a range of output values, and is de-fuzzified in order to resolve a single crisp output value from the group (i.e. a value between 0 and 1). This approach uses the centroid method to obtain the representative non-fuzzy value for the output, as commonly adopted in the Sugeno-type systems. The expert reasoning runs as follows: if all input variables are F, the value of the module is 0 (good response according to all metrics used); if all indices are U, the value of the module is 1 (bad response according to all inputs used), while all the other combinations assume intermediate values. Limits F and U may come from experience, may be extracted from literature, or may be set by law. The weights can be chosen based on the analyst own experience in handling each input.

A servant of the prophet Elisha, Gehazi enjoyed a position of power but was ultimately corrupt, misusing his authority to cheat Naaman the Syrian, a general afflicted with leprosy. As punishment, Elisha cursed Gehazi, transferring Naaman's leprosy to him and his descendants forever. In Rabbinic literature, Gehazi is identified as one of four commoners who forfeited his share in the afterlife because of his wickedness. He is the subject of a poem by Rudyard Kipling. Etymology Two meanings for the name \\"Gehazi\\" have been suggested: \\"valley of vision\\" or \\"valley of avarice\\".Anchor Bible Dictionary Vol. 2, pg. 926 Biblical account Gehazi was the servant of the prophet Elisha. He appears in connection with the history of the Shunammite woman and her son; and of Naaman the Syrian. On the latter occasion, Gehazi, overcome with avarice, obtained in the prophet's name two talents of silver and two changes of garments from Naaman. Consequently, he was guilty of duplicity and dishonesty of conduct, causing Elisha to denounce his crime with righteous sternness, and determine that \\"the leprosy of Naaman would cleave to him and his descendants for ever\\". After Elisha cursed Gehazi, Gehazi became leprous \\"as white as snow\\" (2 Kings 5.27). Later in the biblical narrative, he appeared before King Joram, to whom he recounted the great deeds of his master.Fausset, Andrew R., Fausset Bible Dictionary under \\"Gehazi\\", 1949 The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges suggests that \\"it is probable that the accounts of Elisha’s work and influence are not related [in 2 Kings] in their chronological order\\".Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on 2 Kings 8, accessed 29 December 2017 Appearance in literature In Rabbinic literature, Gehazi is one of those who, denying the resurrection of the dead, have no portion in the world to come, but share the doom of Balaam, Doeg, and Ahithophel (Sanh. 90a). Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 90a, 107b It was while on the way to Shunem with Elisha's staff that Gehazi proved himself to be a skeptic concerning the resurrection. He considered the whole procedure a joke (Pirḳe R. El. xxxiii.), and instead of obeying the order not to address even one word to any passer-by, nor return any salutation, he asked derisively of those he met whether they believed the staff had the power to restore the dead to life. For this reason he failed.In other ways, too, Gehazi displayed a mean character, as, for instance, in his behavior to the Shunammite woman (Pirḳe R. El. xxxiii.; Ber. 10b; Lev. R. xxiv.; Yer. Yeb. ii.; Sanh. xi.); he drove away Elisha's disciples (Sanh. 107b); he possessed a magnet by which he lifted up the idol made by Jeroboam, so that it was seen between heaven and earth; he had \\"Yhwh\\" engraved on it, and in consequence the idol (a calf) pronounced the first two words of the Decalogue (ib.). When Naaman went to Elisha, the latter was studying the passage concerning the eight unclean \\"sheraẓim\\" (creeping things; comp. Shab. xiv. 1). Therefore when Gehazi returned after inducing Naaman to give him presents, Elisha, in his rebuke, enumerated eight precious things which Gehazi had taken, and told him that it was time for him to take the punishment prescribed for one who catches any of the eight sheraẓim, the punishment being in his case leprosy. The four lepers at the gate announcing Sennacherib's defeat were Gehazi and his three sons (Soṭ 47a). Nevertheless, Elisha is censured for having been too severe. He \\"thrust him away with both hands\\" instead of using one for that purpose and the other for drawing him toward himself (Yer. Sanh. 29b). Elisha went to Damascus to induce Gehazi to repent, but Gehazi refused, quoting his master's own teachings to the effect that a sinner who had led others into sin had no hope (Sanh. 107b; Soṭah 47a). Gehazi was interrupted in his conversation with the king because the praises of a holy man should not be sung by a sinner (Lev. R. xvi. 4). He had been disrespectful to his teacher, calling him by name (Sanh. 100a). His character is said to have been that of a man who, though learned, was jealous and avaricious, unchaste and a cynic (Yer. Sanh. xi.).Jewish Encyclopedia He is ostensibly the subject of Rudyard Kipling's poem Gehazi, thought to be aimed at Rufus Isaacs, a member of the British Liberal government at the time the poem was composed.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, article on Rufus Isaacs Gehazi also appears in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.

Description The software can fetch e-mail on a per-user, per-account basis, or it can fetch e-mail from a catch-all account and distribute by the To: field based on the e-mail addresses assigned to users in Active Directory. Note that the latter method does not work for bcc'd e-mails and some mailing lists, as the recipient cannot be easily identified by looking at the e-mail headers. However, failed e-mail can be delivered to a central account, where the correct recipient can be identified manually and then distributed accordingly by the administrator. The software is then scheduled to fetch e-mail at regular intervals, from once every 24 hours right down to once every 5 minutes (SBS 2008). If the situation requires it, an immediate download can be started from the configuration screen. There are non-supported workarounds to shorten the fetch interval, such as on SBS 2003 creating the new DWORD value ScheduleAccelerator in the registry folder \\"HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\SmallBusinessServer\\\\Network\\\\POP3 Connector\\". The new fetch interval time becomes the amount specified in the configuration GUI, divided by the value set for ScheduleAccelerator. For example, if the user sets the interval in the GUI to 15 minutes, and the ScheduleAccelerator value is set to 3, it will fetch e-mail every 5 minutes. In SBS 2008 the program Pop3Connector.exe in \\"%programfiles%\\\\Windows Small Business Server\\\\Bin\\" can fetch e-mail instantly by using the argument -downloadNow. Using this command with Task Scheduler allows the user specify a fetch interval that suits their needs.  Alternatives  Other commercial alternatives are available that can be utilised for any version of Microsoft Exchange (or any RFC compliant SMTP server for that matter). These products typically provide increased functionality such as more frequent checking times (e.g.: once per minute) advanced logging and alerting, antispam/antivirus functionality, aliasing and content filtering.

It is the only existing universal bank not listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange. The bank, owing to its name, caters heavily to coconut farmers, but also serves a wide-ranging clientele. In July 2020, the Philippine government raised its stake with the bank to 97%, thus resulting for its conversion to a government controlled bank. History The last incarnation of the original logo of UCPB, which lasted from the 1980s until 2009. UCPB started on May 15, 1963, as First United Bank (Philippines). With only four branches at the time, it was a small commercial bank. UCPB's origin can be found in Presidential Decree 755 (or P.D. 755) where President Ferdinand Marcos in July 29, 1975, instructed the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) to \\"formulate and recommend for adoption credit policies affecting production, marketing and processing of coconut and other palm oils\\" and \\"to provide readily available credit facilities to the coconut farmers at preferential rates.\\" The PCA, headed by Juan Ponce Enrile, then purchased the 72.2 percent of First United Bank owned by Jose Cojuangco. Cocobank was the official short bank name in the 1980s and the early 1990s. In 1990, UCPB, along with Equitable Banking Corporation (now Banco de Oro Universal Bank), Philippine National Bank and the Far East Bank and Trust Company (now the Bank of the Philippine Islands), formed MegaLink, one of the three main interbank networks in the Philippines. However, UCPB's ATM services date back to the 1980s, when it was one of the first financial institutions to offer ATM services. It established its pre-need services arm, Cocoplans, in 1993. The bank is also heavily involved in social development projects and other charity works. Today, UCPB is one of the largest Philippine banks, with 188 branches and 279 ATMs nationwide. It is also the only universal bank to have a rural banking subsidiary, although this has since been merged into its thrift banking operations since late 2005. In November, the last quarter of 2015, UCPB is now a member of BancNet. In 2018, the bank started its conversion to a government bank, joining the league of LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines and Overseas Filipino Bank. Later in 2020, the Philippine government dropped the privatization plans of the bank by further raising its stake of ownership from 75% to 97%, thus resulting furthermore for UCPB in becoming as a state-owned and controlled bank.Government expands UCPB stake to majority. Retrieved 08-16-2020. Subsidiaries and affiliates Subsidiaries of UCPB are the following: *UCPB Leasing and Finance Corporation *UCPB Savings Bank *UCPB Securities, Inc. Competition Due to its position as a universal bank, UCPB competes primarily against major Philippine banks like Metrobank, Banco de Oro, East West Unibank, BPI, Land Bank of the Philippines and Philippine National Bank. As a state controlled bank, it joins the league in competition with other government banks - Development Bank of the Philippines, LandBank and Overseas Filipino Bank.

The manga ran from January 1, 2003 to January 23, 2008 in Shogakukan's magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday. The individual chapters have been collected into a total of 27 tankōbon (bound volumes). In 2006, Wild Life received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen. A live-action version of the series had been scheduled for March 2008. However, NHK announced the cancellation of the drama on January 11, 2008 when a giraffe and her calf suddenly died at the Akita Omoriyama Zoo where it was being filmed. NHK stated later that week that they would air two of the three completed episodes as stand-alone stories. Plot Tesshō is your typical high school delinquent with a special skill. He has a perfect pitch. This skill enables him to hear things most people wouldn't. After helping a local vet, Kashiyuu, save a small dog, whom he later names Inu (Japanese for \\"dog\\"), Tesshō realizes his calling in life is to become a veterinarian. After passing veterinary school Tesshō finds himself out of a job and out of luck. But due to some connections with an old high school friend, Tesshō is allowed to take the test to enter the famous R.E.D. Vet hospital. Characters ; :A high school delinquent with a perfect pitch. He does not care for his future until he saves a dog and decides he wants to become a vet. He adopts the dog and names it . Currently, he is a vet at R.E.D and is in Section 2, meaning he cares for wildlife. Sometimes he is misunderstood as being incompetent because of his blond hair. Thus his nickname is \\"Blond Haired #1 Idiot Vet in Japan\\". However, he is a very capable vet and has treated a human in one case. He is also afraid of ghosts. ; :A nurse at R.E.D hospital. She is Tesshō's assistant and accompanies him on worldwide missions. She often thinks that Tesshō is an idiot but respects him very much. It is hinted that she might like him. ; :The head of Section 2 who has a sense of absolute insight of animals. Since he was young, he was taken on worldwide trips with his father to gain knowledge and experience to become a vet. Because of this, he can now see through symptoms within seconds. His father is a world-famous vet and is known as \\"Professor Ryōtō\\". He wants Tsukasa to become his successor even though Tsukasa wants to stay a vet at R.E.D. His real age is unknown but compared to the recent storyline, he still retains his youthfulness from 20 years ago. He is rumored to be bisexual and appears to like Tesshō. He also has a beautiful grandmother who recently had her 100th birthday but still looks like a 25-year-old. ; :He is a member of Section 2 who had been assigned from Section 3. He graduated from Teito Veterinary College Doctorate Program but he works in R.E.D because of his admiration for Ryōtō and his father. At first, his way of thinking is quite like the \\"regular vets\\" who don't work at R.E.D. However, after he is told that Tesshō is more capable than him, he strives to outshine Tesshō and become a better vet. From Tesshō and Ryōtō he learns that a vet also needs to treat the heart and soul of the patient and their owners. From this, he tries hard to smile and care for his patients but ends up scaring them away.

Written by guitarist Brian May, it is the closing track on the album. The song is notable for having two choruses sung entirely in Japanese, and it was released as a single exclusively in Japan, reaching #49 on the charts. (The B-side was \\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\\".) This song features a plastic piano and harmonium, both of which are played by May. They brought in a local choir to sing the chorus at the end. On the album, the song is concluded by a one-minute instrumental intro featuring a Shepard tone melody, which is actually a reprise of the beginning of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\": this was intended to create a \\"circle\\" in the album, typical, for example, of Pink Floyd's albums. Live performances It was performed live in Tokyo during the Jazz Tour in 1979 and again when the band visited Japan during The Game and Hot Space tours in 1981 and 1982, respectively. When Queen returned to Japan with Paul Rodgers in 2005, a truncated acoustic version was played during May's solo set. The same arrangement was used for Queen + Adam Lambert's festival appearances in Japan in summer 2014. Two years later, during the Japanese gigs of the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour, the song was played in its entirety featuring the full band. In other media \\"Teo Torriatte\\" was covered by Japanese singer Kokia on her 2008 Christmas album Christmas Gift, and by Mêlée in 2010 and can be found on the Japanese version of their album The Masquerade released in Japan on 18 August 2010. Andre Matos (former Angra singer) covered the song on the Japanese Edition of his 2010 effort Mentalize. Queen's version is also one of 38 songs included on the benefit album, Songs for Japan (compiled in response to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Tōhoku), released on 25 March 2011. Romanisation of the title The song's title in Roman letters uses an outdated form of romanisation by applying the particle を (\\"wo\\"/\\"o\\") to the word before it. Under more modern convention, \\"手をとりあって\\" would be romanised as, \\"Te o Toriatte,\\" or \\"Te wo toriatte.\\" Furthermore, although the Japanese single's cover gave the romanised version of the title as \\"Teo Toriatte\\", the back cover of the A Day at the Races album misspells this as \\"Teo Torriatte\\" (adding an additional \\"r\\").

The tale is about a badger called Tommy Brock and his arch enemy Mr. Tod, a fox. Brock kidnaps the children of Benjamin Bunny and his wife Flopsy, intending to eat them, and hides them in an oven in the home of Mr. Tod. Benjamin and his cousin Peter Rabbit have followed Tommy Brock in an attempt to rescue the babies. When Mr. Tod finds Brock asleep in his bed, he determines to get him out of the house. His initial attempt fails, and the two eventually come to blows. Under cover of the fight, the rabbits rescue the baby rabbits. The tale was influenced by the Uncle Remus stories, and was set in the fields of Potter's Castle Farm. Black and white illustrations outnumber those in colour. The tale is critically considered one of Potter's \\"most complex and successful in plot and tone.\\"MacDonald 1986, p. 23 Potter's publisher wanted Mr. Tod to be the first in a new series of Peter Rabbit tales in larger formats with elaborate bindings, but Potter disliked the idea. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod and its 1913 follower, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were published in the new formats, but the idea was eventually dropped and the ordinary bindings were adopted for reprints. The two tales were the last completely original productions by Potter. She continued to publish sporadically but used decades-old concepts and sketches rather than new images and ideas. In 1995, an animated film adaptation of the tale was featured on the BBC television anthology series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.  Background  Potter, 1912 Following her acquisition of Hill Top Farm in 1905 in Lancashire (now Cumbria), Potter began her most creative and productive years as a children's author and illustrator.MacDonald 1986, p. 87 By the end of the decade, however, she had grown weary of writing for children. Her eyesight was failing, and the demands of operating her farm and caring for her aging parents limited the amount of time and attention she could allocate to the production of books.Taylor 1987, p. 144 In 1912 however, she brought Peter Rabbit and his kin together for one last time in The Tale of Mr. Tod. She thought her editors too cautious and too concerned about offending the public, and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots. In Mr. Tod she offered her fans two villainous characters - Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, a fox and a badger. The Tale of Mr. Tod and the book to follow in 1913, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were her last completely original works.Kutzer 2003, p. 133 Her marriage to William Heelis in October 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children's author and illustrator, but she continued to produce sporadically over the following years at the demand of fans and publisher, though relying upon decades-old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations.MacDonald 1986, p. 19Kutzer 2003, p. 157  Composition and publication  Influenced in part by the Uncle Remus stories, Mr. Tod is longer than Potter's earlier tales, and set in the Sawrey countryside at Bull Banks and Oatmeal Crag, two fields Potter acquired with Castle Farm in 1909. Pen and ink sketches outnumber the watercolors.Lear 2008, p. 243 Potter's publisher Harold Warne received the text of Mr. Tod in November 1911, though Potter had written the tale some time in the past.Taylor 1996, p. 124 Warne had doubts about the name 'tod' for a fox, but Potter responded: > \\"Tod\\" is surely a very common name for a fox? It is probably Saxon, it was > the word in ordinary use in Scotland a few years ago, probably is still > amongst the country people. In the same way \\"brock\\" or \\"gray\\" is the country > name for a badger. I should call them \\"brocks\\" - both names are used in > Westmoreland. \\"Brockholes\\", \\"Graythwaite\\" are examples of place names; also > Broxbourne and Brockhampton [...] \\"Hey quoth the Tod/it's a braw bright > night!/The wind's in the west/and the moon shines bright\\"—Mean to say you > never heard that?\\" Esthwaite Water (above), Bull Banks, and Oatmeal Crag are three real world locales depicted in the book's illustrations. The tale is about undesirable elements of society. Warne objected to Potter's opening paragraph: \\"I am quite tired of making goody goody books about nice people. I will make a book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.\\" He altered the text to read, \\"I have made many books about well-behaved people.\\" Potter responded: > If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal > too much afraid of the public, for whom I have never cared one tuppenny- > button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly good, > because it gets away from \\"once upon a time\\".Taylor 1987, p. 146 She teased him about the name Bull Banks and his sensitivity to less than genteel expressions: \\"One thinks nothing of bulls and tups in the farming world; but after you objected to cigars it occurred to me to wonder.\\"Taylor 1987, p. 143 There were no objections, and the tale was finished in July.Lear 2008, p. 245 Tommy Brock The spring of 1912 was emotionally unsettling for Potter; her father was ill and severe strikes across the country caused hardships. In April 1912, she managed to get away from London for Hill Top to execute background drawings for the tale. By July, most of the colour blocks were finished, but Potter was concerned about the anatomy of the fox, and checked photographs and reference books in the Natural History Museum in an attempt to distinguish the true English red fox (Vulpes vulpes) from other species. The book was finished by the end of July when she left for holiday at Lake Windermere.Lear 2008, pp. 244-5 Completion of the tale had taken longer than usual because her time had been shared with participation in a campaign opposing hydroplanes on Lake Windermere and the proposed construction of an aeroplane factory near the lake. The Tale of Mr. Tod was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1912, and dedicated to Francis William, the two-year- old son of her cousin Caroline (Hutton) Clark, who had married the Laird of Ulva and was living and farming on a small island off the coast of Mull: \\"For Francis William of Ulva - someday!\\" During the course of the tale's development, Warne proposed launching Mr. Tod as the first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines. Potter objected. She did not want to become involved in a new series; her eyesight was failing, and she had grown weary of writing. She complained of having difficulty in producing \\"fresh short stories\\", and believed children preferred little change in the books.Lear 2008, p. 244 Nonetheless, Mr. Tod, and the next book, The Tale of Pigling Bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as \\"Series II, New Style\\".MacDonald 1986, p. 44 Potter disliked the new endpaper depicting Samuel Whiskers sticking up a giant poster while watched by other animal characters, thinking it too like a railway advertisement. Eventually, the larger format and new designation were dropped, and the ordinary binding adopted for reprints.Taylor 1987, p. 148 Plot The tale begins with Tommy Brock, a badger, being entertained by old Mr. Bouncer, the father of Benjamin Bunny. Mr. Bouncer has been left to tend his grandchildren while his son and daughter-in-law Flopsy are away, but, after smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, he falls asleep in Tommy's company. Tommy puts the bunnies in his sack and slips out. When the parents return, Benjamin sets off in pursuit of the thief. Benjamin finds and brings his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, and the two discover Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, they see the table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house. The fox discovers the badger asleep in his bed, and originally plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.MacDonald 1986, pp. 44-5  Illustrations  Mr. Tod The Tale of Mr. Tod is longer than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour illustrations and a series of 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies.Denyer 2009, p. 113 Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock. Caxton's \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\", 1484 Scholar Ruth K. MacDonald argues that the black and white illustrations emphasize the mythic, permanent quality of the tale with heavy black lines that display little of the delicacy characteristic of Potter's work. She suggests these pictures are more like woodcuts in their heaviness than drawings, and points out they were not \\"tossed off\\" to satisfy fans and her publisher, but deliberately planned to give an antique, primitive quality to the story in the manner of Caxton's woodcuts for his edition of Aesop's Fables.MacDonald 1986, p.49 She notes that the colour illustrations are not vignetted nor surrounded with heavy black lines but rather with a white border that prevents the pastels from fading into the background. The lightness of the pastels and the overall green tones of the colour illustrations contrast with the heavy lines of the black and white pictures and the blocks of print, and this contrast produces a sense of fading because of antiquity yet suggest permanence, \\"as the greenness of nature is permanent and recurring in the cycle of seasons.\\"  Reception  Many of Potter's tales appealed to girls, but Mr. Tod had a strong following among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight at the end of the book accompanied by \\"dreadful bad language\\". Six-year- old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:Lear 2008, p. 247 > I am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in > the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with > a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight - Mr. Tod had nearly > half his hair pulled out of his brush [tail] and five bad bites, especially > one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's > ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock - he had his jacket torn and lost > one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet > bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in > the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock > ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's > comfortable house till springtime - then he will move off into the woods & > live out doors - and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously - & there > will need to be a big spring cleaning!\\"Taylor 1996, p. 125 In 1915, the children of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in the lack of a sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded: > It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy > Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and > when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a > family there are - lots! and what we call a \\"long\\" family, all ages with > some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown- > up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is > not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he > is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not > particularly clean house, I should say - she finishes wearing out Tommy's > celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he > had removed before the hounds came.Lane 2001, p. 127  Critical commentary  The Tale of Mr. Tod was sketched out long before its 1912 publication, and is a forbidding tale with relief only in the landscape illustrations. Graham Greene thought Potter was suffering some sort of emotional disturbance when the tale was composed, but Potter denied the allegation and observed only that she was suffering the after-effects of the 'flu. She deprecated Greene's \\"Freudian school of criticism\\".Taylor 1987, p. 145 There are a few inconsistencies from the naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but simply because they are omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.MacDonald 1986, p. 47 The tale does have archetypical sources in the stories of Uncle Remus. There, both rabbits and foxes contend, but unlike the fox in Uncle Remus, the Potter fox is not particularly wily and the rabbits win, not by outsmarting the fox, but only because they enjoy a stroke of luck. The badger is not a typical animal in Uncle Remus, but in Potter he is the clever one. The finale reunites the rabbits, but the wily animals win nothing. Mr. Tod and the Uncle Remus stories are only similar in depicting the powerless triumphing over the powerful.

Early years Shestakov was born in the village of Syrokorenye in Smolensk Governorate to the Russian noble family of captain-lieutenant Alexey Antonovich Shestakov and Yevdokiya Ivanovna Khrapovitskaya. After finishing his studies at the Naval Cadet Corps (1830–1836), he served in the Black Sea Fleet. In 1837, Shestakov participated in the landing operation near Cape Konstantinovsky for which he was decorated with an order and promoted to the rank of midshipman. In 1838, he was on board the corvette Ifigeniya, participated in the landing operation near Shanedho, and was decorated with an Order of St. Anna of 4th degree. In 1841, Shestakov returned to Sevastopol and participated in several battles against mountaineers. Ivan Shestakov was awarded with an Order of St. Stanislaus of 3rd degree. On April 11, 1843 (Old Style) Admiral Mikhail Lazarev made him his aide-de-camp for two years and promoted him to the rank of lieutenant.

Fort Street Public School (abbreviated as FSPS) is a government co-educational primary school located in Millers Point, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1849, it is one of the oldest government schools in Australia, and is operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities (DEC).  History  Fort Street Public School descends from Fort Street Model School, established in 1849 and the first government model school in the colony of New South Wales; which also makes it one of the oldest public schools in Australia. The history of public education in Australia began when the Governor of New South Wales Charles FitzRoy established a Board of National Education on 8 January 1848 to implement a national system of education throughout the colony. The board decided to create two model schools, one for boys and one for girls. The site of Fort Street Model School was chosen as the old Military Hospital at Fort Phillip, on Sydney's Observatory Hill. This school was not only intended to educate boys and girls, but also to serve as a model for other schools in the colony. The school's name is derived from the name of a street which ran into the grounds of the hospital and became part of the playground during its reconstruction. From the 1850s the Model School offered both primary and secondary education, and was associated with Fort Street Training School, which trained all public school teachers in the colony. The school became Fort Street Superior Public School in 1881. In 1911, the school separated into a primary school, Fort Street Public School, and two high schools, Fort Street Boys' and Fort Street Girls'. The Public School has remained on Observatory Hill near the Model School's original building, which now houses the National Trust of Australia. The secondary section's girls' school and boys' school moved at different times to Petersham, where they amalgamated to become Fort Street High School. There is now no direct relationship between the primary and secondary schools. On 24 November 2016, Queen Rania of Jordan visited the school as part of a state visit with her husband, King Abdullah II of Jordan.  Enrolments  In 2011 the school had an enrolment number of 86 students.NSW Department of Education & Training, School Locator - Fort Street Public School (accessed 2011-05-16) The number of students grew significantly since then, as in 2014 the enrolment was 123 students.NSW Department of Education & Training, School Locator - Fort Street Public School (accessed 2014-12-17) In 2018 the school reported an enrolment of 220 students.FSPS Annual Report 2018 (accessed 2019-12-25) FSPS view to south 2014  School traditions   Student leadership  At the end of each year, a Year 5 student is elected School Captain for the next year by the student body, and another as Vice Captain.

However, silent ⟨k⟩ and ⟨g⟩ occur because of apheresis, the dropping of the initial sound of a word.’Scuse me, squire – ’tis just aphaeresis, Macmillan Dictionary Blog These sounds used to be pronounced in Old and Middle English. Silent (k) The letter ⟨k⟩ is normally silent (i.e. it does not reflect any sound) when it precedes an ⟨n⟩ at the beginning of a word, as in “knife”, and sometimes by extension in other positions. Exceptions include the town of Knoebels Grove ( ) located in Pennsylvania in the United States, the Germanic surname Knaus(s) ( ) used by NASCAR crew chief Chad Knaus and First Lady Melania (Knauss) Trump and also words of foreign origin such as Knesset, the name of the Israeli Parliament, knish, etc. Silent (g) While not as common, the letter ⟨g⟩ is also usually silent (i.e. it does not reflect any sound) when preceding an ⟨n⟩ at the beginning or end of a word, as in “gnat”, “campaign” and “design”. In some words borrowed from Romance languages, it may appear within a word, as in “champagne”, where it originally denoted the phoneme ŋ. An exception is the acronym GNU. In addition, the digraph , in the dominant dialects of modern English, is almost always either silent (as in “bough”, “thorough”, “furlough”, “night” or \\"weight\\") or pronounced (as in “tough”, “enough“ or “laugh”). It is also occasionally pronounced , such as in Edinburgh. When ⟨gh⟩ occurs at the beginning of a word, it is pronounced hard (g) () as in “ghost” and “ghetto”, but also \\"Afghanistan\\". In a few words of Greek origin, digraph ⟨gm⟩ is pronounced , with the (g) being silent, such as in “phlegm”, “paradigm” and \\"diaphragm\\".  Etymology  The ⟨kn⟩ and ⟨gn⟩ letter combinations usually indicate a Germanic origin of the word. In Old English, ⟨k⟩ and ⟨g⟩ were not silent when preceding ⟨n⟩. Cognates in other Germanic languages show that the ⟨k⟩ was probably a voiceless velar plosive in Proto-Germanic. For example, the initial ⟨k⟩ is not silent in words such as German Knecht which is a cognate of knight, Knoten which is a cognate of knot, etc. Likewise, ⟨g⟩ was probably a voiced velar plosive and the initial ⟨g⟩ was not silent: for example, German Gnom, a cognate of gnome, Gneis, a cognate of gneiss, etc.  Examples  Following is a list of words that include a silent ⟨k⟩ or ⟨g⟩.

It has a population of 867 (2001 census), 31% of the population are the Poles and 72% are Roman Catholics. It is situated in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Lomná River flows through the village. The name of the village is of topographic origin borrowed from an older name of the Lomna river (mentioned in 1592 as Lomny), which itself is derived from the words łom (clatter, rumble, susurrus) or załom (turn, bend).  History  The settlement on the territory of the village in the Lomna river valley in Moravian-Silesian Beskids began in the middle of the 17th century. The village was first mentioned in 1684 as Lomna. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia and a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. Lomna as a single municipality was subscribed to the political district of Cieszyn and the legal district of Jablunkov. In 1873 two separate settlements (German: Ortshaften) were recognised: Dolní Lomná (as Dolny Lomna) and Horní Lomná as (Wrchny Lomna). They were divided into two separate municipalities on 1 January 1890. According to the censuses conducted in 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 857 in 1890 to 912 in 1910. In 1910 the majority of the inhabitants were native Polish-speakers (95.1%) accompanied by a German-speaking minority (32 or 3.5%) and Czech-speaking people (13 or 1.4%). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (82.5%), followed by Protestants (17.3%) and Jews (2 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Gorals, speaking Jablunkov dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. From 1975 to 1990 the village was administratively a part of Jablunkov.

He studied under the Benedictines in Bologna before being appointed as the canon of the Siena cathedral and before he was invited to Rome where he became a bishop and counselled four consecutive popes. He served as an abbot in Montecassino but his chastising Pope Paschal II on the Concordat of Segni in 1111 prompted the pope to relieve him from his duties as abbot and ordered Bruno to return to his diocese where he died just over a decade later.Birkhaeuser, Jodoc Adolphe. \\"St. Bruno.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3.

Life Oil on canvas c. 1630 - St. Bruno and Pope Urban II. Bruno was born circa 1045 in Solero either to nobles or parents of modest means named Andrea and Guglielmina. He spent his theological education in a Benedictine convent of Santa Perpetua near his town in Asti and in Bologna at the college there where he also studied humanities and the liberal arts. He became a canon in Siena in 1073 after his ordination to the priesthood around that stage and was assigned as a pastor there. This happened after he decided to go to Montecassino to be a monk but during the trip fell ill in Siena where he remained subject to the needs of the local bishop who thought it best to name Bruno as the cathedral canon. Bruno became noted for his defending orthodox faith and for his extensive knowledge of Sacred Scripture though was better known for his teachings and ardent devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. Bruno later moved to Rome in about 1079 after he was summoned there on the account of his broad learning and great piousness where he was a guest of Pietro Igneo. Bruno was appointed as the Bishop of Segni in 1079 after the canons selected him and Pope Gregory VII himself - a good friend to Bruno and who often sought his counsel - granted episcopal consecration to him in 1080. In 1079 in Rome - before the pope himself - he obliged Berengarius of Tours to retreat his heretical claim that there existed no real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist in a move that won him much praise and admiration. In April 1082 he was travelling from Segni to Rome when Adolfo di Segni seized and imprisoned him. He was freed and returned to Rome but was imprisoned once more alongside the pope in the Sant'Angelo castle. Pope Victor III named him as the Vatican Librarian and he held the position until he left for Montecassino in 1099. Bruno had connections to Pope Urban II whom he accompanied to the Council of Clermont in late 1095 where the First Crusade was inaugurated. He travelled with the pope to Avignon from 11–13 September before setting off for Cluny on 25 October and to the council on 18 November. He accompanied the pope to Limoges from 23–31 December and then onwards to Charroux before going with him to Poitiers on 22 January 1096. Bruno accompanied Urban II to Moyenmoutier on 10 March before going to Tours from 14–20 March and then to Poitiers again from 30 March to 14 April. Their last two destinations were in Nîmes on 12 July and Saint-Gilles on 20 July. In 1099 he entered Montecassino convent without resigning his episcopal see or severing his relations with the outside world. He undertook a mission to the Kingdom of France for Pope Paschal II in 1106 remaining with the pope for several months after his return before returning to his cloister where he was elected as abbot for Montecassino in November 1107. Paschal II made no objection to this pluralism until Bruno condemned the pope's signing of the Concordat of Segni in 1111 was forced to resign his position as the abbot and return to Segni as its bishop. He and other Italian and French bishops rejected the \\"Privilgegium\\" that Emperor Heinrich V extorted from the pope in the latter's imprisonment and censured the pope in a letter for conceding to the king the right to investiture of abbots and bishops. His chastising the pope led to the frustrated Paschal II in turn chastising Bruno for shirking his duties and forced him to return to Segni. He served as a legate to France twice in 1104 and 1106 while he visited Civita Castellana with the pope on 8 September 1105 and in Parma on 2 November 1106. Bruno was also present in Segni to welcome the pope on 4 June 1109 who celebrated the canonization for Bruno's old friend Pietro di Anagni. Bruno once made the mistake when he claimed that priests who committed simonical acts could not perform the Sacraments but he was proven to be wrong since it did not undo the sacrament of ordination despite how severe it was. There is confusion as to whether or not Bruno had been made a cardinal. It is said that he declined the cardinalate while other sources suggest he had been made the Cardinal-Bishop of Segni even though the suburbicarian diocese had not existed at that stage. Some sources suggest that Urban II named him as a cardinal in 1086 while others believe that he was named as a cardinal on 18 July 1079. He died at Segni in mid-1123. Bruno's published works are considered to be exegetical for the most part. He condemned simonical practices in a document written prior to 1109 entitled Libellus de simoniacis. He authored commentaries on the Book of Job and the Psalms as well as on the four Gospels. Bruno also wrote on the lives of Pope Leo IX and Pietro di Anagni. There are 145 homilies of his that are still preserved. Sainthood Bruno's canonization was celebrated under Pope Lucius III on 5 September 1181 in Segni. He is considered the patron saint for Segni.

It contains at least 33 species. The males in breeding plumage are often highly colorful. The Setophaga warblers are an example of adaptive radiation with the various species using different feeding techniques and often feeding in different parts of the same tree. Most Setophaga species are long-range migrants, wintering in or near the New World tropics and seasonally migrating to breed in North America. In contrast, two Setophaga species, the palm warbler and yellow-rumped warbler, have winter ranges that extend along the Atlantic coast of North America as far north as Nova Scotia. Taxonomy The genus Setophaga was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827. The type species was subsequently designated by Swainson in the same year as the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla. The genus name is from Ancient Greek ses, \\"moth\\", and ', \\"eating\\". Genetic research has suggested that Dendroica and Setophaga should be merged. This change has been accepted by both the North American and South American Classification Committees of the American Ornithological SocietyA Classification of the Bird Species of South America, accessed 17 August 2016 and the IOC World Bird List.IOC World Bird List New World warblers & oropendolas Most members of the genus as currently recognized were traditionally classified as the genus Dendroica, 29 species at the time of the merger.

It has 394 inhabitants (2001 census), 28.5% of the population are ethnic Poles and 83.7% are Roman Catholics. The village lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It is situated on the foothills of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range. Lomná River flows through the village. The name of the village is of topographic origin borrowed from an older name of the Lomna river (mentioned in 1592 as Lomny), which itself is derived from the words łom (clatter, rumble, susurrus) or załom (turn, bend).  History  The settlement on the territory of the village in the Lomna river valley in Moravian-Silesian Beskids began in the middle of the 17th century. The village was first mentioned in 1684 as Lomna. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia and a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. Lomna as a single municipality was subscribed to the political district of Cieszyn and the legal district of Jablunkov. In 1873 two separate settlements (German: Ortshaften) were recognised: Dolní Lomná (as Dolny Lomna) and Horní Lomná as (Wrchny Lomna). They were divided into two separate municipalities on 1 January 1890. According to the censuses conducted in 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 524 in 1890 to 624 in 1910. In 1910 the majority of the inhabitants were native Polish-speakers (97.9%) accompanied by a Czech- speaking minority (11 or 1.8%) and German-speakers (2 people). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (95.5%), followed by Protestants (28 or 4.5%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Gorals, speaking Jablunkov dialect. A local Catholic church was consecrated in 1896. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. From 1975 to 1990 the village was administratively a part of Jablunkov.

The project was presented for the first time publicly at the 2005 IAF Congress in Fukuoka. The 1.3 billion euro project would involve a radio telescope to be located on the polar region of the far side of the Moon. It is proposed to start the program at the ESA January 2008 ministerial council. Launched between 2013 and 2015, the radio telescope could look for exoplanets and detect signals in the 1-10 MHz range. Such signals cannot be detected on Earth because of ionosphere interference. The radio telescope would consist of a lander vehicle that would deploy dipoles across a 300-400 m area. The dipoles, which receive the cosmic radio signals, would be deployed either by a dispenser or by a team of small mobile robots. The South Polar location would ensure permanent sunlight and direct communication with Earth. The telescope lander would also carry geophones, which could listen to meteorite impacts on the Moon's surface. Another German aerospace consortium, OHB-System, is also promoting a lunar lander concept called Mona Lisa, showing that there is a strong push in Europe for a lunar lander in the medium term.

Burchard of Würzburg (in German Burkard or Burkhard) was an Anglo-Saxon missionary who became the first Bishop of Würzburg (741–754). He was an Anglo-Saxon who left England after the death of his parents and joined Boniface in his missionary labors, some time after 732. When Boniface organized bishoprics in Middle Germany, he placed Burchard over that of Würzburg; his consecration can not have occurred later than the summer of 741, since in the autumn of that year, he was documented as officiating as a bishop at the consecration of Willibald of Eichstädt. Pope Zachary confirmed the new bishopric in 743. Burchard appears again as a member of the first German council in 742, and as an envoy to Rome from Boniface in 748. With Fulrad of Saint-Denis, he brought to Zachary the famous question of Pepin, whose answer was supposed to justify the assumption of regal power by the Carolingians. In 751, he resigned his see in favor of Megingoz, a Benedictine monk from St. Peter's Abbey in Fritzlar, Fr. Alban Butler. “Saint Burckard, First Bishop of Wurtzburg, Confessor”.

The genesis of the group lay in the fact that trafficking in women and children had increased to an unprecedented extent in West Bengal and the Calcutta area and this NGO was an attempt to address the problem. In between the two World Wars, the number of sailors and soldiers had considerably increased and the flesh trade found a ready and expanding market in Calcutta. The Calcutta Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act and the Children Act were passed in order to enable the police to rescue women and children from the brothels. A new bill entitled The Bengal Suppression of Immoral Traffic Bill was placed before the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1932 by Mr. J. N. Basu, an eminent lawyer and social worker. The Bengal Presidency Council of Women and the All Bengal Women's Conference decided to form an independent organization for the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Bengal. This society came into being with the name of All Bengal Women's Union and registered under Act XXI of 1860. The All Bengal Women's Union is affiliated to the International Abolitionist Federation, Geneva. On April 1, 1933, the bill was passed. Romola Sinha, the founder member was the first chairperson of Central Social Welfare Board in West Bengal. Among the other notable ladies who had made significant contributions to the institution were Smt Maneck Modi, Smt Sheila Davar and Mrs Bela Sen. The visit of Princess Anne (in January 2007) was an important event in the history of the Institution. Mrs Davar became the president of the club on the death of Mrs Sinha. She also founded the Bustee Welfare Society located at Lovelock Place. Mrs Bela Sen was the Chairman of the production Department for a long time. The All Bengal Women's Union is assisted in their work by several NGOs such as Save the Children Fund. Projects The major projects of the organization have been: * Creating homes for the housing of old aged women * Creating children's welfare homes (Primary Schools) * Providing vocational training * Developing rehabilitation centers * The Refill Project for those with learning disabilities * The Bakery Project that provides employment to rehabilitated women * Research and documentation into the sex trade of children and women * Counselling services for mentally and psychologically traumatised women (sponsored by the Hope Kolkata Foundation) * Sponsorship programs for health and education needs (in conjunction with ASHA and Save the Children) * Free legal aid to women who are living below the poverty line to those who need it for any purpose * The Sahayika Project, which trains girls who are victims of various atrocities and violence as ayahs and nursing assistants. * The Shikshalaya Prakalpo Project, supported by UNICEF, aims to provide primary school education to the dropouts * The Swadhar Project, intended to work with 25 girls from the red light district is in its genesis References External links * All Bengal Women's Union Category:Organizations established in 1932 Category:Women's organisations based in India Category:Organisations based in West Bengal Category:Prostitution in India ","title":"All Bengal Women's Union"},{"id":"4486632","text":"Anni Viktoria Karlsson (7 October 1909 Finnish Wiki page – 26 June 1990) was a Finland-Swedish novelist. Biography Blomqvist was born in Vårdö, Åland Islands, Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian Empire, the first of ten children of fisherman Viktor Karlsson and wife Anna. Living with the family was Anni's maternal grandmother, who would serve as the basis for the protagonist in the Anna Beata trilogy of books. Blomqvist married seaman Valter Blomqvist in 1936. Together they had four children, Tommy (b. 1939), twin daughters who died only hours after birth in 1940, and Bengt (b. 1945). The family supported itself by fishing, shipping and small-scale farming. Blomqvist was an active member of her community. As chairwoman of the local Martha organisation, she arranged courses and organized vaccinations. She also worked to bring electricity to the Åland Islands. Her first short story was published in 1949, when she won first prize in a writing competition. In 1961, Valter and Tommy disappeared during a fishing trip. Their bodies were never recovered; their boat had presumably been overtaken by a storm. Anni began a diary as a way to deal with her grief. Her debut novel, I stormens spår was published in 1966, and was well received. Two years later, the first novel in the Stormskärs-Maja series, Vägen till Stormskäret, was published. The series of five books, Blomqvist's most famous work, chronicled the life of a woman named Maja, the wife of a fisherman, who struggles with a hard life and living in a patriarchical society. The Stormskärs-Maja novels were adapted for a popular television series in 1975. After the last novel in the series, Vägen från Stormskäret, was published in 1973, she began collaborating with Stig Jaatinen of Helsinki University on a study of the people and community on the Åland Islands. This study was published as Simskäla in 1977. Anna Beata, the first novel in the Anna Beata trilogy, was published in 1979. The stories were partially based on the life of her maternal grandmother. In 1987, her son Bengt drowned. She wrote about this tragedy in the autobiographical Havet finns inte mer, published in 1989. Death and legacy Blomqvist died in her home. She lived her entire life and died in Vårdö. Her home can now be visited by groups on request, and yearly scholarship is awarded in her name. Anni Blomqvist is featured on a stamp issued on 21 March 2009 by the postal authority of the Åland Islands. The stamp, by the artist Juha Pykäläinen, is a portrait of Blomqvist next to a depiction of a traditional Åland house, the motif coming from her Stormskärs-Maja novels. The stamp is part of a stamp booklet called Åland Authors, and also includes a stamp featuring Ulla-Lena Lundberg and a stamp featuring Valdemar Nyman.

The taluk headquarters is a small township on both sides of the Pamba River. Ranni is also one of the largest taluks in Kerala. The renowned Hindu temple of Sabarimala is in this taluk, situated approximately 66 km from the main town, Ittiyappara. Ranni is known for its natural environment, forests, hills, river and good climate.  Etymology  Ranni is derived from similar word in malayalam which means \\"Queen\\" or \\"Rani\\". Ranni is known as \\"The Queen of the Eastern Hill Lands\\"(മലനാടിന്റെ റാണി).  History  The history of Ranni can be traced 5000 years back to the early settlement activity of Adi Dravidans around Sabarimala and Nilakkal. The temple at Sabarimala is an early temple of Kerala, dating back to around 2000 years. The deity's sitting posture and resemblance of the prayer 'Sharanam vili' to \\"Buddham Sharanam / Sangam Sharanam\\" points to the Buddhist past. Buddhist hermits always prefer to stay in interior jungles for solitary contemplation to attain Nirvana. The word 'Ayya' is a Buddhist Pali word means Lord/God. There was an ancient trade route passed through Nilackal between Kerala and Pandian kingdom.  Ranni Karthakal The former rulers of Ranni was known as Ranni Kartha or Karthkal of Ranni they were the \\"Samanthas\\" and blood related family of Thekkamamkoor Raja.18th Century Anizham Thirunal Marthandavarma of Vennad annexed Thekkamkoor kingdom and confiscated all the lands belongs to the former rulers. Ranni Karthas Kioyikal (Palace) were stand at a place called Areekkal. In the 18th century, Knanaya Christians migrated to Ranni from Kallissery and later established the church, St. Thomas Church of Ranni. A significant number of Malankara Orthodox Christians & Mar Thomites also migrated from surrounding areas. In the early 19th century, Dr. Claudius Buchanan visited Ranni and was presented an old hand written Syriac Bible, from Ranni St. Thomas church. Ranni was a part of Central Travancore region before the unification. Until the formation of Pathanamthitta district in 1982, Ranni was a part of Kollam district.  Geography  Ranni is located at . It has an average elevation of 131 m (433 ft) above sea level. The location and elevation is measured around the township. However, towards the east, the elevation is much higher. River Pamba flows through Ranni. The township is situated on either side of the river. According to the Census of India, Ranni has a total of . Out of the total area, or 70% is forest. This forest cover gives Ranni its green environment.  Climate  Like the rest of the state, Ranni has a wet and maritime tropical climate. The region receives most of the rain from the South-West monsoon from June to August and the North-East monsoon during October and November. Although the summer is from March to May, it receives locally developed thundershowers in May. Due to the higher elevation, the climate is cooler towards the eastern area.  Economy  Ranni market on a rainy evening Business is centered on the market in the main township, Ittiyappara situated on the northern side of the river. The economy of Ranni is primarily from agriculture. Ranni is the largest rubber producing taluks in Kerala. The hilly terrain, high humidity and good rain makes it suitable for rubber cultivation. Other major crops are cocoa, coconut, tapioca and pepper. NRIs are also another major source of income. It has the largest NRI population in state of Kerala. Transport Bridge near Vadasserikara Ranni is largely dependent on private buses. Most of the long route KSRTC buses ply on the State Highway - 08. The State Highway - 08 (Punalur- Pathanamthitta-Pala-Muvattupuzha Road) connects the town to other major towns. There is a KSRTC bus depot in Ranni adjacent to Private bus stand. Auto rickshaws are available and generally hired for short distance (1–3 km) where bus service are non-existent or rare. Jeep is another preferred mode of transport where the terrain is hilly or rugged. A train service connecting Ranni is one of the long-standing demands. Although the Union Government has cleared a proposal in 1995, the project awaits implementation. The nearest railway stations are at Thiruvalla and Chengannur which are at a distance of nearly 30 km each. The nearest airports are Cochin International Airport (110 km) and Thiruvanathapuram International Airport (125 km).

Demographics  census, Ranni had a population of 207,782 with a density of 207 per square kilometre. The female-to-male ratio is 1063:1000 higher than the state average of 1059:1000 and significantly higher than the national average of 933:1000. There were 50,132 housing units at an average density of 5 per square kilometre. A very low housing density owes to a large reserved forest area. Ranni's literacy rate is 95%. Although most of the residents are Malayalis there are some Tamil, Sikh, Bihari, Bengali settlers.

JCT Contracts are currently published by Sweet and Maxwell Thomson Reuters.JCT publisher In 2012 the publication was announced of JCT Contracts discovery: the education and learning module from the Joint Contracts Tribunal.Newsflash This was described as an education and learning module for education and training providers, in-house training teams and independent tutors, providing materials for a comprehensive understanding of JCT contracts and JCT contractual procedures and looking at the roles of contractors, employers, sub-contractors and contract administrators and how JCT provisions deal with matters such as payment, control of the works and control of time.RIBA Library catalogue online  Suite of Standard Forms  Suite of Standard Forms means a group of all the mutually consistent documents necessary to operate a particular method of procurement and produced to enable them to be used together, including the following where applicable: *consultant agreements *a main contract between the employer and the main contractor; *sub-contracts between the main contractor and its subcontractors (both for sub-contractors selected by the employer and for other sub- contractors); *a standard form of sub-sub-contract between a subcontractor and such sub-contractor's sub-sub-contractors; *a design agreement between an employer and a specialist designer; *forms of tender for issue by an employer to prospective main contractors and for issue by a main contractor to prospective subcontractors and for issue by a subcontractor to prospective sub-sub-contractors; *a form of contract for the supply of goods; *forms of bond (including performance bonds) and collateral warranties. *the Construction Industry Model Arbitration Rules, adapted from those of the Society of Construction Arbitrators JCT publish guidance on which contract to select.  Main forms  JCT substantially revises and rewrites the family of forms every decade. The most recent suite, replacing the 1998 version, is the 2005 suite, as is commonly referred to as JCT 05. There are now, however, 2009 amendments published. The 2011 versions replaced 2009 amendments for all contracts signed after October 1, 2011. They are considered to be the most popular construction contracts in use in the UK.Pinsent Masons  Main contracts  # Major Project Form (MP11) # Standard Form of Building Contract (SBC11) # Intermediate Form of Building Contract (IC11) # Minor Works Agreement (MW11) # Management Contract (MC11) # Design and Build Contract (DB11) # Construction Management Documentation In 2007 JCT published the Constructing Excellence Contract (JCT/CE), a contract designed to support collaborative working, as advocated by the Latham Report, and can trace its roots back to the \\"collaborative contract\\" published in 2003 by BE, a joint venture between the Reading Construction Forum and the Design and Build Foundation (and now part of Constructing Excellence).NBS Contract Law article April 2009 Smaller project contracts Traditional JCT contracts were seen as too detailed and difficult to use in smaller domestic projects so JCT launched a consumer friendly range of contracts called the \\"Building Contract for the Home Owner\\".Homebuilding & Renovating February 2010 *Building Contract for Home Owner/Occupier (where client deals directly with the builder) (HOB) *Building Contract for Home Owner/Occupier (who has appointed a consultant) (HOC) *Contract for Home Repairs and Maintenance (HO/RMI) Key features The JCT contracts avoid up-front payments from payers to payees. Instead, the payee invoices the payer once work has been certified as completed by an independent third party, the contract administrator (often an architect or surveyor). Often interim certificates are issued where itemised components of the work have been completed, or a verifiable percentage is complete. In the 2009 amendments, the payer or payee can issue the certificate if the contractor administrator fails to do so. The JCT encourages retention of an agreed percentage of the contract sum until practical completion and then a percentage for a period after final completion. This avoids payment in advance for such things as minor defects or snagging which need to addressed at the end of the project or come to light after the project is complete. So the invoice at each point is a percentage of the value of the work certified complete. The payer can deduct an amount; however, under the 2009 amendments, the method for calculating the new amount must be stated. The JCT encourages up-front agreement of liquidated and ascertained damages (LAD) as an estimate of the payer's weekly losses if the payee fails to reach practical completion by the contractual completion Date. If delays are for reasons beyond the contractor's control, the contractor can request an extension of time: if the contract administrator allows this, it in effect extends the period before which the contractor is liable to pay the LAD. The JCT introduced the concept of determination, whereby the contract can be terminated for suspension of works, failure to proceed regularly and diligently, failure to remove defective works, failure to execute works in accordance with the contract, or bankruptcy of the contractor. If one party has ceased to perform the contract (e.g. the contractor has gone past the contractual completion date and has no plan to complete the contract), determination enables the other party to end their obligations (e.g. to pay the contractor to finish the project).Atkinson's Law This is in addition to the common law remedy of repudiation. Reference is made to adjudication as a quick way of resolving disputes which the parties cannot resolve between them. Arbitration or litigation, depending on the preferences of the parties, is also available for the settlement of disputes, but these are never appeals against the decision of an adjudicator; they are the consideration of the dispute or difference as if no decision had been made by an adjudicator.cf Footnote 65 to the 2011 Edition of the JCT Standard Building Contract. If arbitration is chosen, then the reference is conducted under JCT the amended version of the Construction Industry Model Arbitration Rules published by the Society of Construction Arbitrators.cf Clause 9.3 of the 2011 edition of the JCT STandard Building Contract.  Criticisms/alternatives  LawbuildLawbuild has proposed a number of amendments to the JCT contract to protect the client further, with the top four being: to ensure the contractor posts a 10% bond to cover the costs of finding a replacement contractor if the contractor goes into liquidation, to ensure the contractor obtains building regulations certificates before practical completion, to ensure the contractor must accept design changes, and to ensure the employer can control the identities of the contractor's designers. One of the most common disputes around building contracts is with regard to the interpretation of failure to proceed regularly and diligently, and whether the contractor is able to make a claim for loss of profits after determination.Arbitration analysis In contrast in the US, building contracts can normally be terminated for convenience of the client, only paying for the work already done.http://www.fullertonlaw.com/construction-law-survival- manual/default-and-termination.html The JCT makes no distinction between work completed by subcontractors and work completed by the contractor. So the client can end up paying the contractor for work certified and yet the contractor may not pay the subcontractor, for example through insolvency. It may then be hard to work with that subcontractor to complete the work. In contrast in some US states, monies due to subcontractors must be held in trust by the contractor.http://www.fullertonlaw.com/construction-law-survival- manual/trust-fund-laws-and-agreements.html ICE Conditions, New Engineering Contract, FIDIC, GC/Works/I, Model Form, and IChemE Form are alternative formats for building contracts.Standard Contracts Publication of product liability report The Joint Contracts Tribunal in 1989 commissioned a report examining the legal distribution of liability for defective products in the construction industry. Published in 1993 as a book with the title Product liability in the construction industry (Palmer and McKendrick), it included an account of the tribunal's Origin and growth and a list of the seven chairman from 1931 to 1993, including Sydney Tatchell (1931-1956) and Sir Percy Thomas (1956-1960).Norman Palmer and Ewan McKendrick, Product Liability in the Construction Industry, Lloyd's of London Press Ltd, 1993 and listing the other five chairmen as A.B.Waters 1960-1973, P.H.P.Bennett 1973-1978, Norman Royce 1978-1983, Patrick H.

It listed the constituent bodies of the tribunal at that time as the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Building Employers Confederation (formerly NFBTE, later Construction Confederation),New Confederation announcement the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Association of Consulting Engineers, the British Property Federation, and the Scottish Building Contract Committee, together with two organisations of subcontractors – the Confederation of Associations of Specialist Engineering Contractors and the Federation of Specialists and Sub-Contractors (later superseded by the National Specialist Contractors Council and the Specialist Engineering Contractors) – and three local authority associations - of county councils, of metropolitan authorities and of district councils. Annual lecture The JCT Povey Lecture (jct-povey- lecture) is an annual event at which an eminent person is invited to speak on significant matters that are relevant to the construction and property industry. The purpose of the lecture is to encourage ways of continuing to improve the quality and value of construction output.JCT Povey Lecture The Povey Lecture was inaugurated in 2003 to honour Philip John Povey, who had served the JCT for some fifty years. A barrister by profession, from 1951 Povey was a legal adviser to the NFBTE (later the Construction Confederation) and at the same time began to assist the Joint Secretaries of the JCT, later succeeding Howard CloseHoward A.

It is the oldest amateur rugby league club in the world, having been founded in 1873. History The club has, on four occasions, fielded a professional team, but has otherwise remained amateur. Though never achieving major success, the club has had some notable achievements. In 1889 it fielded 12 of the 13 players in a Cumberland v. Yorkshire match at Hunslet, whilst over 50 of its players have been awarded full international honours whilst playing for Millom since 1945. The club's biggest honour came in the 1985-86 season, when they played against Mysons in the British Amateur Rugby League Association National Cup Final. Later that year, the club gave Wakefield Trinity a scare, losing only 8-14 in the John Player Trophy. They were National Conference League division one champions in 1994-1995, and won its challenge cup in 1990-1991. The first team currently plays in the National Conference League Division 3, with the A team representing the club in the Barrow and District League. As well as the open age teams, Millom also has a thriving youth set-up with teams at U8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 level playing in the local competitions. In the 2007-08 season, the club finished as champions of the National Conference league division 2. They currently play at the Coronation Field ground in Millom. The club's colours are maroon and white. The 2007-2008 season has brought a lot of success to the club. The first team were champions of the NCL Division 2, they won the Barton Townley local cup competition, the A team won the league title and the Frank Reid trophy, runners up in the Harry Warman Cup and runners up in the knockout cup.

The Doe Memorial Library, built in 1910, originally housed the main collections. A strictly Beaux-Arts Classical building, it was designed by campus architect John Galen Howard as one of the original structures in the \\"Athens of the West\\" campus plan. The library was meant to be the first building students and visitors saw when entering the university, although today most students enter from the opposite side at Sproul Plaza. Most of the main collections are now housed in the Gardner Main Stacks and Moffitt Undergraduate Library, while Doe serves as the library system's reference, periodical, and administrative center. Reading rooms Leutze's Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth hangs in the Heyns (East) Reading Room of the Doe Library Inside Doe are the two largest reading rooms in the university, named the North and Heyns (East) Reading Rooms. The North Reading room features a large barrel-vaulted ceiling capped with a tall Roman-arched windows at each end. The Heyns reading room,What's New in the Library - East Reading Room Named to Honor Former Chancellor named after Roger W. Heyns, Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley from 1965 to 1971, is the smaller of the two and exhibits hand-carved wood ceilings depicting the names of famous academics throughout history, as well as the companion piece to Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth. The piece was originally a gift to the university in 1882 by Mrs. Mark Hopkins but was soon forgotten after it was stored in the Hearst Women's Gymnasium. It was not until the 1960s, when Dr. Raymond L. Stehle was writing a biography of Leutze, that it was rediscovered and placed in the Heyns Reading Room. The North Reading Room features enormously high ceilings and was restored in 2005 to its original 1910 state. The renovated room features refinished historic tables and chairs, replaced floors, and task lighting similar to the original table lamps.Doe Library Renovation Projects - Doe/Moffitt Libraries Lobby The lobby of Doe features perpetually changing exhibits and also houses the Morrison Memorial Library. This library was a gift to the university by May T. Morrison in 1921 and is considered today to be a \\"no study library.\\" Many of its collections are works of classic or contemporary fiction, and the mezzanine level contains a compact disc listening area. The library evokes the feeling of an East Coast country club and was featured in the 2000 Abercrombie & Fitch Back-to-School Catalogue. Main stacks Underneath Doe is the Gardner Main Stacks, named after the 15th University of California President and Berkeley graduate, David P. Gardner. Built in 1997, these stacks contain of bookshelves and were intended to accommodate the growing library collections. The Gardner Main Stacks consist of four underground floors, each roughly one-and-a-half football fields long and a football field wide. Although underground, it was built with four skylights that allow natural light to permeate even to the bottom floor. Bancroft Library East of Doe is the Bancroft Library, \\"one of the most heavily used libraries of manuscripts, rare books, and unique materials in the United States.\\"Collections This library contains over 60 million manuscript items, 600,000 volumes, 2.8 million photographs, 43,000 microforms, and 23,000 maps. The library originated in 1905 as a center for Latin-American History and Western Americana when it acquired the collections of Herbert Howe Bancroft and gained prominence under the leadership and research of Director Herbert Eugene Bolton. Today, the library also houses the largest collection of ancient papyri in the Western Hemisphere, 300 medieval manuscripts, and thousands of rare and first-edition early European and American works. Some of the most famous library holdings are the Mark Twain Papers, a collection of letters, journals, and nearly 600 manuscripts of unpublished works by Samuel L. Clemens, and pieces of Homer's The Odyssey and Euripides's work from ancient Greece.

In epipolar geometry, with homogeneous image coordinates, x and x′, of corresponding points in a stereo image pair, Fx describes a line (an epipolar line) on which the corresponding point x′ on the other image must lie. That means, for all pairs of corresponding points holds : \\\\mathbf{x}'^{\\\\top} \\\\mathbf{F x} = 0. Being of rank two and determined only up to scale, the fundamental matrix can be estimated given at least seven point correspondences. Its seven parameters represent the only geometric information about cameras that can be obtained through point correspondences alone. The term \\"fundamental matrix\\" was coined by QT Luong in his influential PhD thesis. It is sometimes also referred to as the \\"bifocal tensor\\". As a tensor it is a two-point tensor in that it is a bilinear form relating points in distinct coordinate systems. The above relation which defines the fundamental matrix was published in 1992 by both Olivier Faugeras and Richard Hartley. Although H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins' essential matrix satisfies a similar relationship, the essential matrix is a metric object pertaining to calibrated cameras, while the fundamental matrix describes the correspondence in more general and fundamental terms of projective geometry. This is captured mathematically by the relationship between a fundamental matrix \\\\mathbf{F} and its corresponding essential matrix \\\\mathbf{E}, which is : \\\\mathbf{E} = ({\\\\mathbf{K}'})^{\\\\top} \\\\; \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\; \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{K} and \\\\mathbf{K}' being the intrinsic calibration matrices of the two images involved.  Introduction  The fundamental matrix is a relationship between any two images of the same scene that constrains where the projection of points from the scene can occur in both images. Given the projection of a scene point into one of the images the corresponding point in the other image is constrained to a line, helping the search, and allowing for the detection of wrong correspondences. The relation between corresponding image points, which the fundamental matrix represents, is referred to as epipolar constraint, matching constraint, discrete matching constraint, or incidence relation.  Projective reconstruction theorem  The fundamental matrix can be determined by a set of point correspondences. Additionally, these corresponding image points may be triangulated to world points with the help of camera matrices derived directly from this fundamental matrix. The scene composed of these world points is within a projective transformation of the true scene.Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman \\"Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision\\" 2003, pp. 266–267  Proof  Say that the image point correspondence \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\mathbf{x'} derives from the world point \\\\textbf{X} under the camera matrices \\\\left ( \\\\textbf{P}, \\\\textbf{P}' \\\\right ) as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{x} & = \\\\textbf{P} \\\\textbf{X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x'} & = \\\\textbf{P}' \\\\textbf{X} \\\\end{align} Say we transform space by a general homography matrix \\\\textbf{H}_{4 \\\\times 4} such that \\\\textbf{X}_0 = \\\\textbf{H} \\\\textbf{X}. The cameras then transform as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\textbf{P}_0 & = \\\\textbf{P} \\\\textbf{H}^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textbf{P}_0' & = \\\\textbf{P}' \\\\textbf{H}^{-1} \\\\end{align} :\\\\textbf{P}_0 \\\\textbf{X}_0 = \\\\textbf{P} \\\\textbf{H}^{-1} \\\\textbf{H} \\\\textbf{X} = \\\\textbf{P} \\\\textbf{X} = \\\\mathbf{x} and likewise with \\\\textbf{P}_0' still get us the same image points.  Derivation of the fundamental matrix using coplanarity condition  The Fundamental matrix can also be derived using the coplanarity condition.

The fundamental matrix for satellite images  The fundamental matrix expresses the epipolar geometry in stereo images. The Epipolar geometry in images taken with perspective cameras appears as straight lines. However, in satellite images, the image is formed during the sensor movement along its orbit. Therefore, there are multiple projection centers for one image scene and the epipolar line is formed as an epipolar curve. However, in special conditions such as small image tiles, the satellite images could be rectified using the fundamental matrix. .  Properties  The fundamental matrix is of rank 2. Its kernel defines the epipole.

The hands and feet of Jalloh, who was alone in the cell, were tied to a mattress. A fire alarm went off, but was initially turned off without further action by an officer. The case caused national and international outrage. In 2007, two officers were charged with causing bodily harm with fatal consequences and with involuntary manslaughter, respectively, but were acquitted in December 2008 for lack of evidence. According to the presiding judge, contradictory testimony had prevented clarification of the circumstances and had obstructed due process. The Federal Court of Justice annulled one of the acquittals, and since January 2011, a different Landgericht than before is concerned with the case. Life According to his tombstone in Sierra Leone, Oury Jalloh was born in 1968.Kolvenbach, Pagonakis (2006): \\"Tod in der Zelle – Warum starb Oury Jalloh?\\". Documentary film. In 2000, he fled from the Sierra Leone Civil War to Guinea, where his parents were already living, and then further to Germany, where he applied for political asylum. Although his application was declined, he remained in the country. His child with a German citizen was put up for adoption by the mother shortly after birth.Wie starb Oury Jalloh?, Tagesspiegel 2011-07-30. Several weeks before his death, Jalloh was convicted to a prison sentence of three and a half years for commercial drug trafficking. Death According to the investigators, the fire broke out in the cell around midday. The fire alarm went off on two occasions. Noises and cries for help coming from the acoustically controlled cell were registered but ignored. Supposedly, the supervising police officer turned off the sound of the acoustic system shortly before twelve because he could not understand a telephone conversation. Only when the air-control alarm went off did he go down into the basement where the cell was located. But by that time Jalloh was found lying on a burning mattress, his body severely burned and his hands bound to the bed frame.http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/jan2012/oury-j11.shtml The remains of a lighter were only found in later investigations.

In the , Newstead had a population of 2,193 people. Geography Newstead is situated north-east of the Brisbane central business district. The suburb is bounded by Breakfast Creek to the north, Brisbane River to the east, The northern and western parts of the suburb, centred on Breakfast Creek Road, is predominantly commercial, with the remainder of the suburb, particularly near the river, becoming increasingly residential. History The suburb takes its name from Newstead House, built and named in 1846 by pioneer grazier Patrick Leslie, which in turn takes its name from Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, England. The suburb's present role as an up-market residential suburb belies its industrial past. Timber yards, asbestos works, wharves and woolstores once dominated the eastern side of the suburb. The tall iron structure of the No. 2 gasholder on Skyring Terrace is a remnant of the Newstead Gasworks (), which was established in 1887 as Brisbane's second gas works. The structure, however, was originally located at the Petrie Bight gasworks, where it was erected in 1873. The suburb was served by first horse drawn trams from 1885. From 1897 electric trams ran along Commercial Road (until December 1962) and along Ann and Wickham Streets until April 1969. Light Street tram and bus depot was located in the suburb. It opened as a tram depot in 1885, saw its last trams in December 1968 and finally closed as a bus depot in the mid 1990s, making it one of Queensland's longest continually operating industrial sites. All traces of the depot and its heritage have been obliterated and the site redeveloped, although a remnant of its trackwork - a unique three way set of points - has been preserved at the Brisbane Tramway Museum. In 1888 the Booroodabin Bowls Club was established, making it the oldest bowls club still operating in Queensland. At that time, the club was within the local government area of Booroodabin Division, which was established in 1879 and amalgamated into the Town of Brisbane in 1903. The club's name presumably reflects the local government area. The name Booroodabin is an Aboriginal word meaning place of the she-oaks. Breakfast Creek State School opened on Agnew Street (, now in Albion) on 7 July 1890 and closed on 11 August 1961. Following the closure of the school, the Fortitude Valley Opportunity School relocated into the buildings, becoming Newstead Opportunity School. Later it was renamed Newstead Special School. It closed in 1996. The suburb was served by the Bulimba Branch railway line, which branched off the main north coast line at Bowen Hills and descended towards the river and Breakfast Creek Road, crossing it to reach the industry, wool stores and wharves along the river.Brisbane's Newstead Branch Milne, Rod Australian Railway History, October 2005 pp403-423 The line opened on 16 December 1897 and closed on 31 March 1990. Some remnants of the rail line have been preserved in the wool stores precinct. The name Bulimba reflects historic use of this name for both sides of the Bulimba Reach of the Brisbane River, but today it refers only to the suburb on the south side of the reach. Newstead Park contains the Australian American Memorial () which commemorates the United States of America's contribution to defending Australia during World War II, when General Douglas MacArthur based his headquarters in Brisbane. The foundation stone of the memorial was laid on 3 May 1951 during Coral Sea week (the Battle of the Coral Sea was fought from 4 to 8 May 1942). The completed memorial was unveiled on 3 May 1952 by Sir John Lavarack, then the Governor of Queensland. In the , Newstead had a population of 2,193 people.  Heritage listings  Newstead has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: *199 Breakfast Creek Road () : Newstead House Demographics In the 2011 census, Newstead had a population of 836 people; 49.8% female and 50.2% male. The median age of the Newstead population was 36 years of age, 1 year below the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 4.2% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 16.5% of the population. 67.8% of people living in Newstead were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%. The other top responses for country of birth were England 4.4%, New Zealand 3.8%, United States of America 1.9%, South Africa 1.3%, Saudi Arabia 1.1%. 81.6% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.4% Cantonese, 1.4% Arabic, 0.8% Persian (excluding Dari), 0.8% Italian, 0.8% Spanish. The most common responses for religion in Newstead were No Religion 27.9%, Catholic 25.4%, Anglican 18.4%, Uniting Church 6.6%, and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.1%. Transport Brisbane Transport continues to serve the suburb by bus. A cross river ferry, also operated by Brisbane Transport, links the suburb to Bulimba. The suburb is also linked to the city by \\"City Cat\\" catamaran ferry service. CityCycle sharing station in Newstead  Amenities  Booroodabin Bowls Club (nicknamed \\"The Boo\\") is on the corner of Breakfast Creek Road and Edmonstone Street (). Pride of the suburb is Newstead House, Brisbane’s oldest existing home, built for pioneer Darling Downs squatter Patrick Leslie in 1846. It is set in superb grounds overlooking the mouth of the creek and is within easy walking distance of the famed Breakfast Creek Hotel - a flamboyant Victorian structure which has been described as 'the very soul of Brisbane'. Newstead House’s glory days came during the time of the residence of Captain John Clements Wickham, the official resident and magistrate of the Moreton Bay settlement and a noted and gracious host. Wickham had previously been Commander of and sailed with Charles Darwin. While an admission fee must be paid to visit the house, the gardens (now Newstead Park) are a public park.  Education  There are no schools in Newstead. The nearest primary schools are New Farm State School in New Farm and Ascot State School in Ascot. The nearest secondary school is Fortitude Valley State Secondary College in Fortitude Valley, but, having opened in 2020 with Year 7 only, will not offer all years of secondary schooling until 2025. Other years of secondary schooling are available at Kelvin Grove State College in Kelvin Grove and Kedron State High School in Kedron.

It can present as an acute non-recurrent postinfectious event in children, or chronic relapsing episodes in adults with hematological malignancies or tertiary syphilis. Described by Julius Donath (1870–1950) and Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943) in 1904, PCH is one of the first clinical entities recognized as an autoimmune disorder. Signs and symptoms Pediatric patients usually present with acute onset of hemolytic anemia with fatigue, exercise intolerance, pallor, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria, preceded by exposure to cold temperature and preceding viral-like illness. This may be complicated by acute renal failure due to nephrotoxic free hemoglobin and tubular obstruction. Although the disease may be fulminant during onset, the acute form generally follows a transient, self-limiting course. Chronic relapsing PCH manifests as episodic hemoglobinuria and anemic symptoms, usually milder than the acute form. While the classical syphilitic PCH becomes infrequent, paraneoplastic cause with underlying hematological malignancies especially in the elderly should be considered. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenomegaly are not pertinent to PCH, unless associated with underlying lymphoproliferative disorders. This form remains refractory if the underlying condition is not treated. Cause Infectious agents are implicated in the acute form of PCH. Viral agents include measles, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Non-viral agents include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Chronic relapsing PCH is classically associated with syphilis, as well as hematological malignancies including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloproliferative neoplasms.  Pathophysiology  The exact pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. The hallmark feature is the formation of polyclonal IgG autoantibody against the P antigen, which is a polysaccharide surface antigen on red cells in most humans. As a weak, biphasic antibody, it absorbs to the P antigen in the cold temperature as in the periphery in the primary phase, and fixes complement on recirculation to the core temperature in the secondary phase, resulting in intravascular hemolysis.  Diagnosis  The purposes of laboratory investigations are to: # Confirm the presence of intravascular hemolysis in terms of metabolic products of red cells and hematopoietic response. # Establish the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and differentiate from other AIHA. # Identify other supporting features as in hematopathological findings. For intravascular hemolysis, the laboratory parameters include increased serum free hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, unconjugated bilirubin, and reduced haptoglobin. Urine tests may show elevated hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria in chronic cases. Reticulocytosis may not be apparent in the acute phase or when there is viral-induced myelosuppression. Once the clinical suspicion of autoimmune hemolytic anemia is made, direct antiglobulin test (DAT) or direct Coombs' test is the first line of investigation to confirm the presence of warm autoantibodies. Testing with polyspecific and IgG-specific antiglobulin agents is usually negative, and that with C3-specific agent may be positive. On excluding warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA), the cold agglutinin titer should be examined for cold agglutinin disease (CAD). The diagnosis of PCH is suspected when both WAIHA and CAD are excluded. The complement level is usually low. Donath- Landsteiner test is the confirmatory test for PCH. It involves the cooling of the patient's serum to 4°C to allow the absorption of anti-P autoantibodies to the red cells, followed by warming to 37°C to activate complement fixation and hemolysis. Indirect DL test with addition of ABO-compatible P antigen-positive blood can be performed in case the direct DL test is negative, since the complement in the original serum may be consumed and result in false negative. The hematopathological findings can reflect both the presence of intravascular hemolysis and the underlying immunological process. The complete blood count usually shows normocytic anemia. Reticulocytosis may be subtle in the acute phase. Peripheral blood smear may show corresponding polychromasia. Neutrophil erythrophagocytosis is suggestive of PCH, while the absence of red cell agglutination as in CAD or microspherocytosis in WAIHA should also be noted. Classification AIHA can be classified as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which includes cold agglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. These classifications are based on the characteristics of the autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Each has a different underlying cause, management, and prognosis, making classification important when treating a patient with AIHA. \\\\----- :Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ::*Warm-antibody type :::*Primary :::*Secondary (lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders) ::*Cold-antibody type (anemia) :::*Primary cold agglutinin disease :::*Secondary cold agglutinin syndrome ::::*Associated with malignant disease ::::*Acute, transient, infection-associated (acute cold antibody mediated AIHA complicating Mycoplasma pneumoniae or viral infections) ::::*Chronic (lymphoproliferative disorders) ::*Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria :::*Idiopathic :::*Secondary ::::*Acute, transient (Infections other than syphilis) ::::*Chronic (syphilis) ::*Mixed cold- and warm-antibody type :::*Idiopathic :::*Secondary (lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders) ::*Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia :::*Autoimmune type :::*Drug absorption type :::*Neoantigen type  Management  Acute PCH is usually transient and self-limiting. Supportive treatment includes rest, normothermia and transfusion when indicated. Intensive care for the development of acute kidney injury should be offered. Plasmapheresis is proposed to be an adjunctive measure to facilitate recovery. Steroids and other immunosuppressants are sometimes administered and the beneficial effect is uncertain. Immunotherapy is considered in refractory to corticosteroids and immunosuppression. Monoclonal antibodies e.g. rituximab (anti-CD20) and eculizumab (anti-C5) have been used but the therapeutic benefits are controversial. Antibiotic therapy should be given if syphilitic cause is confirmed, while investigations and management for hematological malignancies should be pursued in adult patients with unexplained PCH.  Epidemiology  Estimated incidence of PCH is 0.4 per 100000 population, and the prevalence ranges from 1.6% to 40% in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The prevalence depends on the sensitivity of the immunologic methods applied. The age of onset is often <5 years in the pediatric population, with male predominance ranging from 2.5:1 to 5:1 in male-to-female ratio. The majority of PCH were accounted by congenital or tertiary syphilis in the early 1900s. Since the application of antibiotic therapy and prenatal screening, syphilitic PCH has become a rare entity. It is now increasingly recognized in pediatric patients with preceding viral-like illness.

Biography He was born in 975 probably in the Low Countries, and received his education partly from Notker of Liège. He became a canon of Laubach, and apparently was a teacher there. Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, who had a great regard for him, invited him to the court, and nominated him as Bishop of Utrecht in 1010, and he is regarded as the principal founder of the territorial possessions of the diocese, especially by the acquisition in 1024 and 1026 of the counties of Drente and Teisterbant. He was obliged to defend the bishopric not only against frequent inroads by the Normans, but also against the aggressions of neighboring nobles. He was unsuccessful in the attempt to vindicate the possession of the district of Merwede, between the mouths of the Maas and the Waal, against Dirk III, Count of Holland, in the Battle of Vlaardingen in 1018.Bachrach, David S., \\"Civilians and Militia in Ottonian Germany\\", Civilians and Warfare in World History, (Nicola Foote, Nadya Williams, eds.), Routledge, 2017, The imperial award required the restitution of this territory to the bishop and the destruction of a castle which Dirk had built to control the navigation of the Maas; but the expedition under Godfrey of Brabant which undertook to enforce this decision was defeated; and in the subsequent agreement the disputed land remained in Dirk's possession. Adalbold was active in promoting the building of churches and monasteries in his diocese. His principal achievement of this kind was the completion within a few years of the great romanesque Cathedral of Saint Martin at Utrecht. He restored the monastery of Tiel, and completed that of Hohorst, begun by his predecessor Ansfried. To the charge of the latter he appointed Poppo of Stablo, and thus introduced Cluniac monastic reform into the diocese. Adalbold is also mentioned as an author. A biography of Henry II, ', has been ascribed to him; but the evidence for attributing this to him is not decisive. He wrote a mathematical treatise on establishing the volume of a sphere, ', which he dedicated to Pope Sylvester II, who was himself a noted mathematician. He wrote a philosophical exposition of a passage of Boethius. A music theory discussion, ', seems, according to Hauck, to have been ascribed to him on insufficient grounds.

The name is attached to Simon, one of several brothers and children of Alan, son of Flathald. Simon's son Robert was called Boyt or Boyd from the Celtic term boidhe—meaning fair or yellow. While the Celtic origin might be considered improbable, Saxon names from the same period such as Boed or Boyd were also present during that time and may well have been married into the Steward family however, Robert the Bruce granted lands to Sir Robert Boyd as the ancestor of the earls of Kilmarnock. The Scottish peerage of the earls of Kilmarnock ends shortly after William Boyd rebelled in the Battle of Culloden in 1745. William was arrested and executed at the Tower of London in 1746. He left a widow and three sons including James, Lord Boyd who married and succeeded his father as the Earl of Errol, taking his mother's title. Another theory is of territorial origins which may have been taken from the name; Bhoid, the Gaelic term for the island of Bute, located in the Firth of Clyde. The surname was very common in Edinburgh in the 17th century. The Scottish Gaelic form of the surname is Boid (masculine), and Bhoid (feminine).

It has about 5,100 inhabitants. The spa is the biggest in the Moravia region. Geography Luhačovice occupies a valley whose elevation is a minimum of 250 m above sea level. The north-western edge of the valley is formed by the slopes of Malé Kamenné. The south-eastern part is formed by the forested Obětové peak (511 m above sea level). The southern section of the vale is surrounded by the hills Velké Kamenné (385 m), Solné (451 m), Zálužné (446 m), Lužné (428 m) and Ovčírny (429 m). All of these hills are part of the Vizovice Highlands and the White Carpathians. The highest peak in the Luhačovice area is Komonec, 672 m above sea level. The eastern and south- eastern sections of the Luhačovice vicinity are part of the White Carpathian Protected Scenic Region). History Luhačovice is first mentioned in a historical document of 1412. It is, however, supposed to have been founded before the year 1287. At the end of the 16th century Luhačovice became the chief townlet of a manor including 12 villages. From 1629 until 1945 the manor and the country estate belonged to the Serényi family. However, in 2016 the property was restituted to Isabella baroness Thienen-Adlerflycht, née countess Serény. The Serényi family were the first to make use of the mineral springs in the area and who built the spa. Local names give evidence that the springs were known and used here ever since the area had begun to be settled; they are first mentioned in the 1669 book Tartaro Mastix Moraviae by Johann Ferdinand Hertodt von Totenfeld. Hotel built by Dušan Jurkovič A new stage of development of both the spa and the town appeared at the beginning of the 20th century, when a Czech physician František Veselý, came to Luhačovice. He decided to get financial means to change Luhačovice into a modern Czech spa by establishing a joint-stock company, which took over the spa from the control of the Serenyis in 1902. They, however, kept on taking a significant part in it financially. The remote and not easily accessible position of the spa was overcome when a local railway line was built here in the year 1904, even before the number of visitors increased due to the construction of the Vlárská Railway Line (1888) and more distant Northern Railway Line (1841).Antonin Jančař: Luhačovice. pp. 73–74, Městský národní výbor (1967), MK ČSR 59-299-84. The first stage of important building development of the spa area was connected with the name of the architect Dušan Jurkovič, the author of the fundamental reconstruction of the Janův House, the hydropathic establishment and other places. After the setting-up of the independent Czechoslovak Republic, mainly in the 20s and 30s, the importance of the Luhačovice spa increased along with the increasing number of inhabitants, which was also formally expressed by giving to Luhačovice the statute of the municipality in the year 1936. Further buildings of architectural importance appeared: the building of the present Municipal National Committee, the Palace-Sanatorium, the Alexandria Hotel, the \\"Fučik\\" and \\"Morava\\" hydropathics, and in 1935, the Social Club. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Nazi Germany, the spa was closed to the Czech public almost completely and was taken possession of by the Nazi organizations. After the liberation of the town in May, 1945, another chapter in the history of the spa began. Between 1945–1947 a new complex of spa buildings was built: the Main and Small Colonnades, the Hall of Vincentka, and the health centre. Social changes after February 1948 influenced both the life of the people in Luhačovice and the spa organization as a whole. Agriculture was collectivized, the woods were nationalized, and the state became the only owner of the natural cure sources and all balneological, accommodation and catering capacities in the spa towns. Some buildings were used to solve the housing problem, and others were divided between the Central Trade Union Council and the Ministry of Health. In 1957 Luhačovice and other spas were given the spa statute, and the spa care was unified in the Ministry of Health. Both the spa care and environment are always in the course of improvement. Water Spa park Luhačovice mineral water is a heavily mineralized (9,854 milligrams of minerals / liter, osmotic pressure 634.7 kPa), naturally effervescent residual seawater, indicated for diseases of vocal cords and breathing pathways, metabolic diseases, stomach and duodenal ulcers, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, and excessive consumption of alcohol. The water is bottled under the brand name Vincentka. There are three wells of Vincentka in Luhačovice. The original one is available to the public in Hall of Vincentka, it is however too low- yield (10–12 liters per minute) to be used for bottling. The second well, Nová Vincentka, was made in 1988. It is 35 meters deep, has a yield of 30 litres per minute and has been used for bottling since 1991. The third well, Vincentka 2, with a yield of 40 liters per minute, is a reserve well for spa medicinal use.

The disturbance that led to the stabbing was reportedly caused by a group of old skinheads advocating white power and making racist remarks to many of the concert-goers. Rioting This took place after there was a skinhead fight outside between antiracist and neo-Nazi skinheads. One of the neo-Nazis who went back inside after the fight was still mad. As he kept raving about white power, people started arguing with him and throwing things at him. When a fight was about to break out and a crowd of people were going to beat him up, security separated him from the crowd and put him behind a small fence. The name calling and racist remarks from both sides kept going behind the fence. This is where there was enough tension and people to overpower security and the fence. The crowd of punks and skinheads rushed in and started beating him up; it was at that point when he was stabbed. The police, in an apparent attempt to disperse the agitated crowd, used tear gas, releasing it not only at the site of the disturbance but also inside the venue itself where no disturbance had occurred, catching many concert-goers unawares. Some attendees became angry and destroyed several police cars outside the venue. Helicopters and riot police were called in and the crowd moved out of the parking lot and into San Bernardino. There were people jumping up and down on police cars and breaking headlights with their steel- toe boots, and one police car was turned upside down. Estimates put the crowd at 1,500 fans who then began vandalizing local businesses and parked cars in the downtown area. Dumpsters were set on fire and several shops were broken into while dozens more were damaged. Many attendees who were driven to the event by parents were unable to disperse as demanded by the police and were subsequently forced into the surrounding neighborhoods. Response Nearly 200 police were called in to quell the riot, which lasted several hours. At least four officers were injured and two concert-goers were hospitalized, one of them being the stabbing victim. The police made over a dozen arrests. The riot caused an estimated $500,000 in damages.

The Fisheries Centre is in Grande-Rivière, Quebec. The Centre d'études Collégiales des Îles is in the Magdalen Islands. The Centre d'études Collégiales is in Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec. The Montreal Campus was created in partnership with Matrix College of Management, Technology and Healthcare to welcome international students. Mission The mission is to offer general and professional collegial level education.article 28 of the Loi du conseil supérieur de l'Éducation (Statuts refondus, 1964, chap. 234). History The Ministry of Education for Quebec was created in 1964. The regional school commissions of the Baie-des-Chaleurs, and the Peninsula were created in 1964 to serve the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region at the primary and high school level. In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created, a network of public colleges throughout the province. In Quebec City, the ministry decided against a public college in the Gaspésie. Consequently, students were to be sent to the Collège de Rimouski for highschool. The Centre spécialisé des pêches in Grande-Rivière was founded in 1983. The Centre des Îles was created in the Magdalen Islands in 1983. In 1989 the Centre de Carleton was created in the Chaleur Bay. The University du Québec in Rimouski (UQAR) decentralized its teaching and developed part-time programs between La Pocatière and Gaspé, including the Magdalen Islands and the Hauterive area since 1969. In 1971, a partnership agreement was signed between UQAR and the continuing education college services regarding adult education. In 1974 the UQAR began to decentralize part-time education. Three regional offices: in Gaspé, Carleton and Matane were created. In 2015, the Cégep de la Gaspésie et des Iles formed a partnership with Matrix College of Management, Technology and Healthcare Inc. to open its Montreal Campus. the campus offers programs in business, technology and healthcare. Programs The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs, which take three- years to complete, apply to students who wish to pursue a skilled trade. In addition, continuing education and services to business are provided.

He founded the Mo'Wax record label in 1992, and has been the only constant member of UNKLE. He directed the 2014 edition of the Meltdown festival on London's South Bank, and curated the 2016 exhibition \\"Daydreaming with Stanley Kubrick\\" at Somerset House. He was the subject of 2018 documentary film The Man From Mo'Wax. Career Lavelle and Tim Goldsworthy co-founded Mo'Wax in 1992. In 1996 Mo' Wax released one of electronic music's most celebrated albums, DJ Shadow's seminal Endtroducing...... Soon after this Lavelle started work on an album with DJ Shadow under the name UNKLE. The resulting release Psyence Fiction featured collaborations with Richard Ashcroft, Mike D, Badly Drawn Boy and Thom Yorke. In 2003, he released a follow-up to Psyence Fiction, titled Never, Never, Land, though this album saw DJ Shadow replaced by Richard File as the second full-time member of UNKLE. It featured collaborations with 3D of Massive Attack and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age among others. He is a longtime resident at Fabric in London, mixing the inaugural Fabric Live mix album. He has also mixed three DJ mix albums for Global Underground. He has produced a number of film soundtracks, including Sexy Beast. Also an in demand remixer, he has reworked tracks by Garbage, The Verve, Beck and Massive Attack. In an August 2006 interview with The Skinny, Lavelle revealed that he was working with Chris Goss and Autolux on the follow-up to Never, Never, Land, entitled War Stories. Of the album's direction, he said \\"It’s rawer than Psyence Fiction and Never, Never, Land although it’s more in the vein of the traditional singer/songwriter. If the first record was UNKLE does hiphop and the second record was UNKLE does electronic, then this one is like UNKLE does rock, but it’ll hopefully still have its continuity.\\" Lavelle produced the title track for longtime collaborators Queens of the Stone Age's 2013 album ...Like Clockwork, which reached number one on the Billboard 200 making it the first Queens of the Stone Age album to top the chart in the United States. The album was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album. In 2014 he was asked to direct the Meltdown festival, following in the footsteps of David Bowie, Patti Smith and Jarvis Cocker. His lineup included concerts by Joshua Homme, Max Richter, Neneh Cherry, Goldie and Mark Lanegan. The event culminated with a live UNKLE:Redux featuring an guest appearance from former member DJ Shadow. Lavelle has scored the soundtrack for Danny Boyle's anthology series Trust starring Donald Sutherland and Hilary Swank.

Biarmosuchians are the most basal group of the therapsids. They were moderately-sized, lightly-built carnivores, intermediate in form between basal sphenacodont \\"pelycosaurs\\" and more advanced therapsids. Biarmosuchians were rare components of Permian ecosystems, and the majority of species belong to the clade Burnetiamorpha, which are characterized by elaborate cranial ornamentation. Characteristics Proburnetia, a biarmosuchian with strange bumps and bosses on its skull, from the Late Permian of Russia The biarmosuchian skull is very similar to the sphenacodontid skull, differing only in the larger temporal fenestra (although these are still small relative to later therapsids), slightly backward-sloping occiput (the reverse of the pelycosaur condition), reduced number of teeth, and single large canine teeth in both upper and lower jaws, and other features (Carroll 1988 pp. 370, Benton 2000 p. 114). In later specialised Biarmosuchia, these resemble the enlarged canines of the Gorgonopsia. The presence of larger jaw-closing muscles (and hence a stronger bite) is indicated by the flaring of the rear of the skull where these muscles were attached. Burnetiamorphs, which made up the majority of biarmosuchian diversity, were characterized by elaborate cranial ornamentation consisting of bumps and bosses. Some burnetiids have a thick domed skull reminiscent of dinocephalians and pachycephalosaur dinosaurs. The vertebrae are also sphenacodontid-like (but lack the long neural spines that distinguish Dimetrodon and its kin), but the shoulder and pelvic girdles and the limbs indicate a much more advanced posture. The feet are more symmetrical, indicating that they faced forward throughout the stride, and the phalanges (fingers/toes) are reduced in length so that they are more like that of later synapsids (therapsids and mammals) (Carroll 1988 pp. 370–1). Biarmosuchians ranged in size from relatively small species with skulls 10–15 cm in length to large species such as Biarmosuchus, which may have had a skull in length. Distribution Currently the most representative group of the Biarmosuchia, the Burnetiamorpha, comprise ten genera: Bullacephalus, Burnetia, Lemurosaurus, Lobalopex, Lophorhinus, Paraburnetia, and Pachydectes from South Africa, Niuksenitia and Proburnetia from Russia, and Lende (MAL 290) from Malawi.: Kruger, A., B.

Other Biarmosuchia include Biarmosuchus from Russia, Hipposaurus, Herpetoskylax, Ictidorhinus and Lycaenodon from South Africa, and Wantulignathus from Zambia. Classification Biarmosuchians are typically considered the most basal major lineage of therapsids. Biarmosuchia consists of a paraphyletic series of basal biarmosuchians that are fairly typical early therapsids, and the derived clade Burnetiamorpha, characterized by skulls ornamented by horns and bosses. Taxonomic history Biarmosuchians were the last of the six major therapsid lineages to be recognized. The majority of biarmosuchians were once considered gorgonopsians. James Hopson and Herbert Richard Barghusen (1986 p. 88) tentatively united Biarmosuchidae and Ictidorhinidae (including Hipposauridae and Rubidginidae) as \\"Biarmosuchia\\", but were undecided as to whether they constituted a natural group or an assemblage that had in common only shared primitive characteristics. They thought that Phthinosuchus was too poorly known to tell if it also belonged, but considered Eotitanosuchus a more advanced form.Hopson, J.A. and H.R. Barghusen. 1986. \\"An analysis of therapsid relationships\\". In: The Ecology and Biology of Mammal-like reptiles (eds. by N. Hotton III, P.D. MacLean, J.J. Roth, & E.C. Roth) pp. 83-106. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press Denise Sigogneau-Russell (1989) erected the infraorder Biarmosuchia to include the families Biarmosuchidae, Hipposauridae and Ictidorhinidae, distinct from Eotitanosuchia and Phthinosuchia. Ivakhnenko (1999) argued that Biarmosuchus tener, Eotitanosuchus olsoni, and Ivantosaurus ensifer, all known from the Ezhovo locality, Ocher Faunal Assemblage, are actually the same species. Even if these taxa are shown to be distinct, Ivakhnenko's paper indicates that Eotitanosuchus and Biarmosuchus are very similar animals. Ivakhnenko also relocates the family Eotitanosuchidae to the order Titanosuchia, superorder Dinocephalia. Benton 2000 and 2004 gives the Biarmosuchia the rank of suborder. Paleoecology Biarmosuchians were rare components of their ecosystems; only one specimen is known for most species. However, they were moderately diverse and there were multiple contemporary species in some ecosystems. All were predators similar to gorgonopsians and therocephalians, though they were generally not apex predators.

Beheler (in regards to what constitutes custody in the requirement to read Miranda rights) but also in other federal court cases related to Miranda law and definition of custody. Although Miranda law has roughly defined custody as the \\"formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement,\\" colloquial language may be less restrictive in the use of custody and is thus sometimes difficult to distinguish from the process of arrest. In addition to collecting data on those who have died in custody, the Bureau of Justice Statistics also tracks all deaths related to arrest. This aids in collecting data from the fringes of custody or attempts to arrest an individual.  Causes of death  The causes for death in police custody may range from suspected homicide by members of the police, killings by other inmates, death due to psychological or physical abuse, capital punishment, to suicide, accidental death, or natural causes. The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics collects data regarding both the cause of death, as well as medical and criminal records of those that die in police custody (restricted to those in federal prison and local jails).  Estimates  The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 17,358 individuals in custody died during the period from 2007-2010. Other publications focus on the rate per 100,000. US jails report deaths that total a mortality rate of 128, and prisons at 264 per 100,000. There are differences in methodology used to obtain these statistics, as some jurisdictions include deaths during attempted arrests, while others do not. Other research has focused on specific states, such as Maryland and the rate of death by identity (gender, race, age). Based on some findings, African-American males appear to be over-represented as victims of sudden custody deaths. Further research with larger sample sizes is necessary.  Watchdog organizations  The Marshall Project collects and produces reports on police killings as well as maintaining a curated list of links to articles and publications related to death in police custody in the United States.

Foreign custody by American agents (police, military, etc.)  = International custody law = There are numerous laws and international treaties regarding treatment of foreigners, especially during wartime, of which the Geneva Convention is the most widely recognized and internationally ratified. It contains provisions that classify and define both prisoners of war (as well as civilians and the wounded or infirm) and the manner in which they are to be treated. These include but are not limited to: murder, mutilation, hostage taking, and outrages upon personal dignity. These ratified documents are the base of US international custody law and can be seen to be misapplied in some of the proceeding cases. = Examples of persons who have died in custody = * Jamal Naseer (Afghan soldier allegedly beaten to death by US forces) * Nagem Hatab (Iraqi killed by elements and possible heart attack) * Manadel al-Jamadi (suspected terrorist tortured and killed) Vietnam See Human rights in Vietnam Yemen See Human rights in Yemen Zimbabwe See Human rights in Zimbabwe See also * Capital punishment in the United States * Detention * Infectious diseases within American prisons * Life imprisonment * Prison overcrowding * Prisoner rights in the United States * Private prison * War on Drugs * Extrajudicial killing * List of prison deaths * Police brutality * Prisoner suicide * Capital punishment * Institutional racism * African-American family structure#Black male incarceration and mortality * :Category:People who died in police custody * :Category:People who died in prison custody * List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States * List of freedom indices References Custody Category:Imprisonment and detention Category:Deaths in custody ","title":"Death in custody"},{"id":"4486886","text":"Cordelia is an unincorporated community in Solano County, California, United States.

It contains Jesus' predictions of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and disaster for Judea, as well as his eschatological discourse.Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an Abbreviated Bible Commentary. 23rd edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1962.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 37 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; complete) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 20-37)  The Temple's destruction  Titus Destroying Jerusalem by Wilhelm von Kaulbach After his teachings in the previous chapter, all set in the Temple courts, Jesus finishes his teaching in the Temple for the day and leaves. On his way out of the Temple an unnamed disciple remarks how extensive the Temple (Herod's Temple) is. The buildings might have reached up to 150 feet (45.72 m) in height and they were adorned with gold, silver and other precious items.Kilgallen 245 In Mark, the scale of the Temple is emphasised; in Luke's gospel, the beauty of the stonework is highlighted. \\"Do you see (all) these great buildings?\\" replies Jesus. The word \\"all\\" is added in the Vulgate (omnes), the Ethiopic version Gill's Exposition of the New Testament on Mark 13, accessed 7 December 2017 and the New International Version. Jesus acknowledges their greatness, but predicts that \\"not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down\\". This is the last reference made by Jesus to the Temple in Mark's narrative. Jesus seems to anticipate that it will be destroyed, although he does not say when or how. Later, Jesus travels back to the Mount of Olives. Mark says that Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Jesus privately, as he was sitting opposite the Temple on the mountain, \\"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?\\": Verses 5–8 :Take heed lest any man deceive you: For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. (5-8 KJV) The \\"beginning of sorrows\\" is a traditional translation, used in the Geneva Bible and the King James Version. Its literal meaning, reflected in texts like the New Revised Standard Version, is \\"the beginning of birth pangs\\".Strong's Concordance, 5604. ódin, accessed 6 April 2020: NRSV It was the general belief that if the Messiah had arrived in Jerusalem, the final Messianic victory and the kingdom of God were close at hand. Jesus, however, seems to set up many additional things that will occur before his final triumph. Verses 9-13 Jesus then predicts that they will be harassed (beaten) by various councils and synagogues, rulers and kings; that they are to say whatever comes to mind, as it will be God speaking through them, and that Jesus' message will be given to every nation. Families will be torn apart, that \\"All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.\\" and also make reference to beating or scourging taking place within synagogues.Meyer, H. A. W., Meyer's NT Commentary on Mark 13, accessed 8 April 2020 Verses 14–23 Jesus then predicts a disastrous event in Judea: :\\"When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong — let the reader understand — then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out. Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that this will not take place in winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now— and never to be equaled again. If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect—if that were possible. So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. (14-23 NIV) The warnings about false Christs are thought by some scholars to be warnings against others claiming to be the messiah or Christian teachers who claimed to actually be the reincarnation of Jesus.Brown et al. 623 Acts of the Apostles 5:36-37 contains a description given by Gamaliel about Theudas and Judas the Galilean, both also mentioned by Josephus, who also claimed to be leaders of new movements. Mark inserts his own comments to the reader about the abomination, suggesting the phrase was some kind of code between him and his audience. It is a quote from the Book of Daniel where it appears in 9:27 as part of a prophecy that the book claims was given to the prophet Daniel by Gabriel during the Babylonian captivity about Jerusalem's future. An \\"Anointed One\\" would come, be \\"cut off\\", and then another people would come and destroy Jerusalem and set up the abomination in the Temple. 11:31 speaks of it in context of a great battle of Kings, and 12:11 uses it as part of Daniel's end time vision. Many modern scholars, who believe Daniel was pseudepigraphically written in the mid-2nd century BC, believe that these references really refer to the shrine to Zeus set up by Antiochus IV Epiphanes with a Pagan altar on the Altar of Holocausts in the Second Temple in 168 BC.Brown et al. 624 and Miller 44 What exactly it meant to the Early Christians and Mark's audience is unknown, with some thinking it refers to Titus' destruction of the Temple, others that it might be a reference to Caligula's attempt to have a statue of himself put in the Temple.Brown 144 Others have seen the abomination as the Antichrist. It is unclear whether this refers to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, but many Christians after that event certainly have seen it that way. More recently it has been suggested that the abomination in Mark is a reference to the crucifixion itself.Peter G. Bolt, The Cross from a Distance: Atonement in Mark’s Gospel, New Studies in Biblical Theology, 18. Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 2004. According to Mark, Jesus made this prediction years before the Temple was actually destroyed in 70. Acts 6:14 states that Stephen, the first Christian martyr (unless one counts Jesus), was falsely accused of claiming Jesus would destroy Israel and the Mosaic law before he was stoned to death, an event Acts claims Paul observed. Predictions of Jerusalem's destruction are also found in Micah 3:12. Scholars who hold that this does refer to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, and is an example of prophecy after the event, use this section to date Mark, and all works believed to have copied from it, slightly before or after the year 70Jesus in a World of Colliding Empires, Volume One: Introduction and Mark 1:1--8:29: Mark's Jesus from the Perspective of Power and Expectations, Mark J. Keown Wipf and Stock Publishers, 20 Mar 2018 see page 8. In Mark 15:29 Jesus is mocked as having claimed that he would destroy the Temple and raise it again in three days, a statement of Jesus that Mark does not record in the narrative, although he is falsely accused of claiming he would destroy the man made Temple and replace it in three days in 14:57. This gives rise to the interpretation of the Temple's destruction as the death of Jesus' body, the body of God, and his resurrection three days later. That Jesus predicted the Temple's destruction and his rebuilding of it in three days is stated in John 2:19 and is used as evidence against him in Matthew 26:61.  Olivet discourse  Last Judgement by Michelangelo After the destruction of the Temple and the event in Judea, Jesus seems to predict a universe shaking event and his great triumph: :But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. (24-31 KJV) He then tells them that no one except the \\"Father\\", God, knows when this will all happen, not even the \\"Son\\", Jesus himself, see also Kenosis. He then uses the parable of the Man Going On a Far Journey to describe his followers as his servants watching their master's house waiting for him to return. Jesus thus ends with two parables, the parable of the Leafing Fig Tree and the parable of the man on a journey. The fig tree, which Jesus cursed in Mark 11:14 for being barren, is now used as a metaphor. Whereas it is barren now, when it is summer it will be about to bear its fruit, like these signs signal that God's plan is about to be fulfilled. The parable of the man on the journey cautions the disciples that they should always be on watch, as he could return at any moment and would want the house well cared for. There are several interpretations of all this. The most straightforward is that there will be a horrible event in Judea and that at some unspecified time Jesus will come and gather his \\"elect\\", the term early Christians used to refer to themselves. The statement that \\"this generation\\" will still be around to see the coming of these things has posed problems for those who hold that this is a literal prediction of the end of the world, and has given rise to such legends as the Wandering Jew. The word for generation also means race in Ancient Greek, and so could refer to the Jews, or perhaps all people. Others think Jesus is just using the apocalyptic language of his time symbolically, as many Jewish prophets did, to highlight the fact that Christian suffering and Jerusalem's destruction, though seemingly the end of the world, are necessary to achieve what Jesus deems will be the final victory of good over evil and that this generation refers to seeing Jerusalem's destruction.Kilgallen 250-253 Many have interpreted this as Jesus predicting the end of the world and his Second Coming. Jesus' statement about the sun and moon sounds very apocalyptic. It is a quote from Isaiah 13:10 where Isaiah uses it metaphorically as part of his prophecy of the fall of Babylon. The stars falling from the sky is from Isaiah 34:4 about God's judgement on all the nations of the world. Perhaps there is a political connotation here. By using these two quotations together, Jesus might be comparing the Roman domination Israel is currently undergoing to the Babylonian captivity it had undergone six centuries previously. The coming of the kingdom of God would be replacing Roman rule with God's rule just as the Jews were freed from Babylon. Yet whereas the Babylonian captivity ended with the return to Jerusalem, the replacement of Roman rule will be preceded by Jerusalem's destruction, a sharp change in what people thought of as the coming of God's kingdom. It was a general belief of the Jews that the messiah would rule from Jerusalem, and many Christians have believed that after the Second Coming Jesus will rule the world from Jerusalem. Many Christians have seen this as a prediction of Roman tyranny being overcome by Christianity, as Jerusalem, then \\"Babylon\\" (Rome), then all the unrighteous nations will be replaced by the Son of Man's coming. The Roman Catholic Church has always seen itself as partly the kingdom of God on Earth and some have thought the coming of the Christian Church is what is predicted here. The Son of Man coming in clouds is from Daniel 7:13. This is from a prophetic dream of Daniel about a kingdom that would \\"devour\\" the whole world and how it would be replaced by the Son of Man's \\"everlasting kingdom\\". \\"The elect\\" will be \\"gathered\\" from every part of the world and \\"unto Heaven\\", a reversal of Zechariah 2:10 where God would come and live among his chosen. God rounding up his chosen people is found in many Old Testament books, but none have the Son of Man doing this, showing how Jesus had altered the prophecies about the messiahBrown et al. 624 Just before Stephen is stoned in Acts, he says \\"I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\\" (7:56), perhaps showing the Son of Man's coming means Heaven. In John 12:23 Jesus speaks of the Son of Man's glory as his death: \\"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.\\" He predicted the coming of God's kingdom in Mark 9:1 in this generation followed by the Transfiguration, perhaps showing God's kingdom is already here because of Jesus' coming. What exactly Jesus is predicting here is vague. Paul, in 1 Thessalonians, probably the earliest surviving Christian document, speaks of how Jesus rescues us from the coming \\"wrath\\" or \\"anger\\" in 1:10. He also says that \\"we\\", Paul and the other Christians, would see Jesus return to raise the dead in their lifetime in 4:13-18, but not exactly when, saying immediately after in chapter 5:2 that it will come like \\"a thief in the night\\". However, in Philippians 1:23 he speaks of going to Christ as death. The ideas of Jesus' imminent return and the final messianic triumph coupled with that of it being delayed until an unknown date in the future, or perhaps until after death, have always characterized Christian thought through the ages. In every generation, including ours, there have always been those who say the end is just around the corner and those who say who knows when it will happen so just live a good life or that being good people is what brings God's kingdom. Augustine reflected, drawing from this passage, that a person should be more concerned with their own \\"last day\\", their death. :...when it tells us to watch for the last day, every one should think of as concerning his own last day; lest haply when ye judge or think the last day of the world to be far distant, ye slumber with respect to your own last day...Let no one then search out for the last Day, when it is to be; but let us watch all by our good lives, lest the last day of any one of us find us unprepared, and such as any one shall depart hence on his last day, such he be found in the last day of the world. Nothing will then assist thee which thou shalt not have done here. His own works will succour, or his own works will overwhelm every one.Sermon of Augustine \\"On the words of the Gospel, Mark xiii. 32, 'But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.'\\" A description of the end times is greatly expanded in the Book of Revelation, which describes itself as a vision given by Jesus after his death to the author. Here, too, are predictions of immediate upheavals (1:3) coupled with delays in the final working out of God's plan of thousands of years or even indefinite periods of time (20). A similar account is also found in Matthew 24, where the description of the coming of the Son of Man is greatly expanded. Luke 21 specifically states that there will be armies surrounding Jerusalem and that will precede desolation. This is all the information that Jesus gives about the far future in the Gospels. In the Gospel of Thomas saying 51 a disciple asks Jesus when the \\"new world\\" would arrive and Jesus replies \\"What you are looking forward to has come, but you don't know it.\\" In saying 113 they ask him when the \\"kingdom\\" will come. \\"It will not come by watching for it. It will not be said, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't see it.\\" This ends the section of Mark showing how Jesus was the prophesied Jewish Messiah but not in the way people had expected. It was the general belief that the Messiah's coming would inaugurate the final victory of good over evil, and end all worldly suffering, thought to be a symptom of evil.Kilgallen 250 Jesus entered Jerusalem in Mark 11 in the manner of the messiah who would bring God's kingdom on Earth, then cursed the fig tree outside the Temple in which he fought with the money changers. He then defeated the priests and taught the people, establishing his authority and the priests lack of it. He then ends with a prediction of the Temple's destruction and then uses the fig tree as metaphor to show how what Jesus has described will lead to the coming of God's kingdom. Yet whereas the Messiah entering Jerusalem as Jesus had done was to bring God's rule immediately, Jesus says that it will come later, at an unknown time after seemingly calamitous events. Jesus is speaking of these things on the Mount of Olives, where Zechariah 14:4 has the final messianic battle occurring. In the next and final section Mark shows the necessity of suffering, Jesus' Passion, as a part of God's plan. Jesus is crowned the King of the Jews only on the cross and only overcomes all suffering and evil by his resurrection from the dead. References Sources  *Brown, Raymond E.

Later buildings were designed by architects such as Charles Willard Moore (Haas School of Business) and Joseph Esherick (Wurster Hall). South Hall is one of the few original buildings still standing on the Berkeley campus Very little of the early University of California (c. 1868-1903) remains, with the Victorian Second Empire-style South Hall (1873) and Piedmont Avenue (designed by Frederick Law Olmsted) being notable exceptions. What is considered the historic campus today was the eventual result of the 1898 \\"International Competition for the Phoebe Hearst Architectural Plan for the University of California,\\" funded by William Randolph Hearst’s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of Antwerp (eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco, 1899). This unprecedented competition came about from one-upmanship between the prominent Hearst and Stanford families of the Bay Area. In response to the founding of Stanford University, the Hearst Family decided to \\"adopt\\" the fledgling University of California and develop their own world- class institution. Although Emile Bénard, a Frenchman, won the competition, he disliked the \\"uncultured\\" San Francisco atmosphere and refused to personally revise the plan to the site. He was replaced by fourth-place winner John Galen Howard, who would later become UC Berkeley's resident campus architect. Only University House, designed by architect Albert Pissis and then home to the President of the University of California, was placed according to the original Bénard plan (today it is the home of UC Berkeley's Chancellor). Memorial Glade, at the center of the Berkeley campus. Much of the older campus is built in the Beaux-Arts Classical style, which was the style preferred by John Galen Howard and Phoebe Hearst (who paid his salary). This area is now referred to as the “classical core” of the campus. With the support of University President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and '60s. These included the Hearst Greek Theatre, the Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Doe Memorial Library, California Hall, Wheeler Hall, (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, Sather Gate, and the Sather Tower (nicknamed \\"the Campanile\\" after its architectural inspiration, St Mark's Campanile in Venice). Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly \\"serious\\" were designed in shingle or Collegiate Gothic styles, such as North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall. Sather Gate marks the original southern entrance to the campus, and now the entrance from Sproul Plaza Buildings Founders' Rock, University House, Faculty Club and Glade, Hearst Greek Theatre, Hearst Memorial Mining Building, Doe Library, Sather Tower and Esplanade, Sather Gate and Bridge, Hearst Gymnasium, California, Durant, Wellman, Hilgard, Giannini, Wheeler, North Gate and South Halls are a California Historical Landmark and are now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Bowles Hall—built in 1928—is California's oldest state-owned dormitory and is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Wheeler Hall, built to represent John Galen Howard's \\"City of Learning\\" design, currently houses the campus' largest lecture hallJohn Galen Howard retired in 1924, his support base gone with both Phoebe Hearst's death and President Wheeler's resignation in 1919. William Randolph Hearst, seeking to memorialize his mother, contributed to Howard's resignation by commissioning Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan to design a series of dramatic buildings on the southern part of the campus. These were originally to include a huge domed auditorium, a museum, an art school, and a women's gymnasium, all arranged on an eastward esplanade and classically oriented towards the campanile. However, only the Hearst Women's Gymnasium was completed before the Great Depression, at which point Hearst decided to focus on his estate at San Simeon instead. The dramatic increase in enrollment during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s led to the rapid expansion of the campus, beginning with the University's appropriation of the north end of Telegraph Avenue to form Sproul Plaza and headed on its east side by Sproul Hall, a new neoclassical building for the campus administration. However, the administration moved out of Sproul and into California Hall, situated in the heart of campus, after students barricaded themselves in Sproul during the 1964 Free Speech Movement. (Today, Sproul Hall houses Student Services and the Admissions Office, and Sproul Plaza is the center of student activities.) A series of huge Brutalist concrete buildings were also built to provide much- needed housing, lab, office, and classroom space, including Evans Hall, Cory Hall, Wurster Hall, Davis Hall, McCone Hall, Zellerbach Hall, the undergraduate dorms Units 1, 2, and 3, and others. With over three acres of usable space, the Valley Life Sciences Building is one of the largest academic buildings in the world.Gray-green Evans Hall is the tallest instructional building on the campus and houses the offices of faculty in mathematics, statistics, and economics. Evans Hall is widely reviled; a recent campus development plan lists Evans Hall as a candidate for demolition within the next fifteen years. Cory Hall, the electrical engineering building, was the site of two attacks by the Unabomber in 1982 and 1985. Its neighbor, Soda Hall (computer science), is one of the few classroom buildings on campus with showers. It was completed in August 1994 at the cost of $35.5 million, raised entirely from private gifts. Dwinelle Hall is another large building on campus; its rooms are strangely numbered both because Dwinelle Hall was built with entrances on different levels on a slope and because its expansions were numbered differently from the original building. Because this confusing building is host to both large lecture classes and numerous discussion classes, it is sometimes called the \\"freshman maze.\\" Underneath UC Berkeley's oldest buildings is a system of steam tunnels which carry steam for heat and power.Steam Tunnels at UC Berkeley During the 1960s, Berkeley students chained the doorknobs of the Chancellor's office in protest over the Vietnam War. The Chancellor, having no other way in or out of the building, used the steam tunnels to escape. Afterwards, the exterior double doors on that building were changed so they only had one doorknob, and this remains today. New construction developments Recent developments include the newly completed Jean Hargrove Music Library, the fourth free-standing music library to be constructed in the United States. In 2006, the new Stanley Hall, named after the 1946 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, opened its doors. It houses the headquarters of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) and serves as a center for interdisciplinary teaching and research as part of the campus Health Sciences Initiative. Designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects,Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects the . building contains 40 laboratories, and a 300-seat auditorium. Davis Hall, primarily the location of the Civil Engineering Department, will be expanded to serve as the headquarters for the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS). Estimated at ., the building will support a \\"broad array of projects, from information systems for emergency and disaster response in an earthquake to life-saving medical alert sensors, to ‘smart’ buildings that automatically adjust their internal environments, to save energy and reduce pollution.\\" It will include nanofabrication facilities, labs, and classrooms. The Tien Center for East Asian Studies, named for Chang Lin Tien, one of the campus' most beloved chancellors, consists of the C.V. Starr East Asian Studies Library, intended to maintain Berkeley's strengths in the subject. The first free-standing buildings to be devoted to East Asian Studies in the United States, the Library is open after completion and dedication in October 2007. The library houses the largest collections of East Asian materials outside of Asia and behind the collections of Harvard University and the Library of Congress. Jacobs Hall is a building for design innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. It is located on the north side of Hearst Avenue, across the street from the main campus. The floor plan includes flexible space with tools for prototyping, iteration, and fabrication. Construction began in August 2014 with a $20 million grant from the Paul and Stacy Jacobs foundation. The hall was inspired and named after Paul Jacobs, UC Berkeley alumnus, philanthropist, and also the executive chair of Qualcomm Inc.

He was of noble birth, a relation and pupil of Adalward, Bishop of Verden, and became canon of Hildesheim. Otto I made him his chancellor and notary immediately after his accession, and on the death of Archbishop Unni in 936 nominated him to the vacant see. None of the early incumbents of the see ruled for so long, and none did so much for the diocese, though his success was partly the fruit of his predecessors’ labors and of peculiarly favorable circumstances. Under Adaldag the metropolitan see obtained its first suffragans, by the erection of the bishoprics of Ribe, Schleswig, and Århus; and that of the Slavic territories of Aldenburg (today's Oldenburg in Holstein) was also placed under Hamburg. Not to be confused with Oldenburg in Oldenburg, which had formerly belonged to the diocese of Verden. He resisted successfully a renewal of the efforts of Cologne to claim jurisdiction over Bremen. He gained many privileges for his see, in jurisdiction, possession of land, and market rights, by his close relations with the emperors, especially Otto I. He accompanied the latter on his journey to Rome, and remained with him from 961 to 965, and is mentioned as the emperor's chief counselor at the time of his coronation in Rome. Otto placed the deposed pope Benedict V in his custody. After Adaldag's return to Hamburg, he still maintained these relations, and his privileges were confirmed by Otto II and by the regency of Otto III. The later years of his life were troubled by inroads of the Danes and Slavonians on the north, and he may have witnessed the sack of Hamburg by the latter under Mistiwoi.

While other sepoys looked on, Shaikh Paltu continued to defend the two British officers, calling upon other sepoys to join him. The sepoys, with obvious sympathy for Pandey, chose to remain inactive. Some are reported to have attacked their officers with the butts of their muskets. The sepoys threw stones and shoes at Shaikh Paltu, threatening to shoot him if he did not let go of Mangal Pandey. Paltu however \\"continued to cling to him\\" until the British officers had time to rise and escape. Major-General J.

Pandey and the jemander in command of the guard were subsequently court-martialed and executed. The 34th Bengal Native Infantry was disarmed and disbanded six weeks later on May 6. Shaikh Paltu was promoted to Havaldar (native sergeant) a day after Mangal Pandey's execution and recommended by General Hearsey for a decoration. However, some days before the disbandment of the 34th BNI (Bengal Native Infantry), he was lured to an isolated spot in the cantonment and murdered by several of his former comrades.Wagner, Rumours and Rebels (2010), p.97 referring to The Delhi Gazette, 9 May 1857 References  Suggested readings  * Malleson, G.B., The Indian Mutiny of 1857, pp. 36–39, Delhi, Rupa & Co. publishers, 2005 (first published: 1890)  External links  * The Great Mutiny: India's War for Freedom Category:British East India Company Army soldiers Category:Indian people of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 ","title":"Shaikh Paltu"},{"id":"4486974","text":"Kanjavely is a village in the Thrikkaruva panchayat of Kollam district in Kerala, India.NREGA report  References  Category:Villages in Kollam district ","title":"Kanjavely"},{"id":"4486977","text":"The Jervis Bay tree frog (Litoria jervisiensis) also known as the curry frog in reference to the odour this frog produces, is a species of Australian frog associated with wallum swampland along the east coast of New South Wales; ranging from the Queensland border to eastern Victoria.

The bridge was built to access land cut off after a new section of canal was made. It is now home to many boat moorings, and popular with fishermen. Location Bethells Bridge is located near the small hamlet of Hempholme. It crosses the Driffield Navigation between Struncheon Hill Lock to the south, and Emmotland to the north. A small lane from Brandesburton, passing through Burshill serves as the only public access to the bridge. ;Situated on the Driffield Navigation *Next place upstream = Emmotland *Next place downstream = Struncheon Hill Lock History During the navigation improvements of 1803-1811, a new lock cut was made to bypass a large meandering loop of the River Hull around Struncheon Hill. Mr Richard Bethell, who owned the Leven Canal, also owned the land around this cutting, and needed a bridge to access his land. William Chapman, who carried out the works, decided on a swing bridge, as was in common use in the rest of the navigation, but since the cut was made wide to accommodate the flow of the river, a fixed section was used to reduce the size of the opening section. One of the original cast iron wheels before removal A brick base, with a cast iron curved edge strip, was built. It rested on a cast iron pintel, with four wheels to steady the structure, which rested on a curved iron track. The main structure of the bridge was built from wood (probably oak), with steel bracing to hold the structure together. The hand rails were also built from wood, and had crisscross stays. At the same time, a bridge- keepers house was built, presently known as Swing Bridge Cottage. When the traffic dropped on the Driffield Navigation, the bridge keeper was no longer needed and the house was left empty. In the early 1970s Colin Askin occupied the property, and restored and improved the house, raising his family there. Without regular maintenance, the bridge started to deteriorate in the 1950s. The wood warped, and became inoperable some time in the late 1960s. In 1978, on a cold December night, a large lorry crossed the bridge, and made it unsafe. As this bridge was a vital link for the milk lorry which served the farms, and also a short cut for other farm traffic the local farmers - Richard Southwell from Rotsea Carr farm, Mike and Ben Southwell from Hunts Hill farm (all brothers), and Mr Keith Conner from Struncheon Hill farm, along with Colin Askin and other members of the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association helped replace, and repair the structure. Around that time, Bethells Bridge Boat Club was also founded, and had their first AGM in 1979. The BBBC used Ben Southwell's land along the bank above the bridge for moorings. In later years, other farmers started letting out moorings on their banks, so there are now many boats moored in the area. Looking across the bridge from the east bank Further work was carried out on the structure by the DNAA in the early 1980s to improve the brickwork and structure of the bridge foundation. Further work was carried out on the fixed portion of the bridge in the later part of the 1980s, which replaced the handrails, and many of the bridge floor beams which were going rotten. Driffield Navigation Trust, the current managers of the navigation decided that they had a claim on Swing Bridge Cottage. Colin Askin, who still lived there, could have claimed squatters rights, but since he believed in the restoration of the navigation moved out. It was being let to generate funds, but in 2017 was sold to private ownership. The new bridge is lifted into place During the late 1990s the wooden fixed section was in need of attention. It was replaced with a steel structure, but kept the wooden decking. In 2001?, a new steel bridge was built for Brigham Bridge. Unfortunately this was too small for the traffic that needed to go over it, and it sat in the construction yard for the next few years. In March 2003 this bridge was used to replace the complete structure, with a new fixed section decking made from steel, installed by Simpsons Civil Engineering of Driffield. Access to the bridge for boaters became a problem after the bridge keeper was no more. There were no bridge moorings below or above the bridge, and often crew would need to be let off on the bridge base. In 2006 a landing stage was constructed by DNAA above the bridge to make it easier to operate. The shaded waters of the bridge also attract shoals of perch and pike.

Adalgar is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. His feast day is 29 April. Life When Rimbert, who was appointed in 865 to succeed Ansgar, the first archbishop of Hamburg, died at the abbey of Corvey, the abbot Adalgar gave him his brother, also named Adalgar, as a companion. The younger Adalgar was then a deacon. Toward the end of Rimbert's life, he was consecrated bishop to assist the latter; and he succeeded him in the archbishopric on 11 June 888. During the latter half of his twenty years’ rule, age and infirmity made it necessary for him also to have a coadjutor in the person of Hoger, another monk of Corvey; and later five neighboring bishops were charged to assist the archbishop in his metropolitan duties. Adalgar lived in troublous times. Although Arnulf's victory over the Normans (891) was a relief to his diocese, and although under Louis the Child (900-911) it suffered less from Hungarian onslaughts than the districts to the south and east of it, yet the general confusion restricted Adalgar's activity, and he was able to do very little in the northern kingdoms which were supposed to be part of his mission. There were also new contests over the relation of Bremen to the archiepiscopal see of Cologne. Bremen had originally been under the jurisdiction of Cologne; but this relation was dissolved on the reestablishment of the archbishopric of Hamburg in 848; and Pope Nicholas I had confirmed the subordination of Bremen to Hamburg in 864. In 890 Archbishop Hermann of Cologne wrote to Pope Stephen V, demanding that the archbishop of Hamburg, as bishop of Bremen be subject to him. The course of the controversy is somewhat obscure; but it is known that Stephen cited both contestants to Rome, and when Adalgar alone appeared, Hermann being represented by delegates with unsatisfactory credentials, the pope referred the matter to Archbishop Fulk of Reims, to decide in a synod at Worms. In the meantime, Stephen died; and his successor Formosus placed the investigation in the hands of a synod which met at Frankfurt in 892 under Hatto of Mainz. On the basis of its report, Formosus decided that Bremen should be united to Hamburg so long as the latter had no suffragan sees, but should revert to Cologne when any were erected, the archbishop of Hamburg meanwhile taking part in the provincial synods of Cologne, without thereby admitting his subordination. Little is known of Adalgar's personality.

It means that, ethically, people are responsible to one-another in the face-to-face encounter. Specifically, Lévinas says that the human face \\"orders and ordains\\" us. It calls the subject into \\"giving and serving\\" the Other.Lévinas, Ethics and Infinity, 1985, pp. 95, 98, 119.Paul Marcus, In Search of the Good Life: Emmanuel Levinas, Psychoanalysis and the Art of Living, Karnac Books, 2010, p. 16. Overview Lévinas' phenomenological account of the \\"face-to-face\\" encounter serves as the basis for his ethics and the rest of his philosophy. For Lévinas, \\"Ethics is the first philosophy.\\" Lévinas argues that the encounter of the Other through the face reveals a certain poverty which forbids a reduction to Sameness and, simultaneously, installs a responsibility for the Other in the Self. Lévinas' account of the face-to-face encounter bears many similarities to Martin Buber's \\"I and Thou\\" relation. Its influence is also particularly pronounced in Jacques Derrida's ethical writings. (However, some post- structuralist thinkers maintain that Derrida does not agree with Lévinas. See, perhaps most significantly, Martin Hägglund.) The major difference between Buber's account of the I and Thou relation and the ethics of the face-to-face encounter is the application of Lévinas' asymmetry towards the other. For Buber, ethical relation meant a \\"symmetrical co-presence,\\" while Lévinas, on the other hand, considers the relation with the other as something inherently asymmetrical: the other as they appear, the face, gives itself priority to the self, its first demand even before I react to it, love it or kill it, is: \\"thou shalt not kill me\\". Such a demand for Lévinas is prior to any reaction or any assertion of freedom by a subject. The face of the other in this sense looms above the other person and traces \\"where God passes.\\" God (the infinite Other) here refers to the God of which one cannot refuse belief in Its history, that is the God who appears in traditional belief and of scripture and not some conceptual God of philosophy or ontotheology. In the face-to-face encounter we also see how Lévinas splits ethics from morality. Ethics marks the primary situation of the face-to-face whereas morality comes later, as some kind of, agreed upon or otherwise, set of rules that emerge from the social situation, wherein there are more than just the two people of the face- to-face encounter. This ethical relation for Lévinas is prior to an ontology of nature, instead he refers to it as a meontology, which affirms a meaning beyond Being, a mode of non-Being (Greek: μή, me \\"non\\" and ὄν, on \\"being\\"). Comparison Face-to-face is similar to Mikhail Bakhtin's ethical concept in art and answerability and Martin Heidegger's concept of the authentic guilt (present/face-to-face) as opposed to an inauthentic other.

They differ from other antenna complexes by their large size and lack of protein matrix supporting the photosynthetic pigments. Green sulfur bacteria are a group of organisms that generally live in extremely low-light environments, such as at depths of 100 metres in the Black Sea. The ability to capture light energy and rapidly deliver it to where it needs to go is essential to these bacteria, some of which see only a few photons of light per chlorophyll per day. To achieve this, the bacteria contain chlorosome structures, which contain up to 250,000 chlorophyll molecules. Chlorosomes are ellipsoidal bodies, in GSB their length varies from 100 to 200 nm, width of 50-100 nm and height of 15 - 30 nm, in FAP the chlorosomes are somewhat smaller.  Structure  Chlorosome shape can vary between species, with some species containing ellipsoidal shaped chlorosomes and others containing conical or irregular shaped chlorosomes. Inside green sulfur bacteria, the chlorosomes are attached to type-I reaction centers in the cell membrane via FMO-proteins and a chlorosome baseplate composed of CsmA proteins. Filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs of the phylum Chloroflexi lack the FMO complex, but instead use a protein complex called B808-866. Unlike the FMO proteins in green sulfur bacteria, B808-866 proteins are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and surround type-II reaction centers, providing the link between the reaction centers and the baseplate. The composition of the chlorosomes is mostly bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) with small amounts of carotenoids and quinones surrounded by a galactolipid monolayer. In Chlorobi, chlorosome monolayers can contain up to eleven different proteins. The proteins of Chlorobi are the ones currently best understood in terms of structure and function. These proteins are named CsmA through CsmF, CsmH through CsmK, and CsmX. Other Csm proteins with different letter suffixes can be found in Chloroflexi and Ca. Chloracidobacterium. Within the chlorosome, the thousands of BChl pigment molecules have the ability to self assemble with each other, meaning they do not interact with protein scaffolding complexes for assembly. These pigments self assemble in lamellar structures about 10-30 nm wide. Organization of the light harvesting pigments Bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids are two molecules responsible for harvesting light energy. Current models of the organization of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids (the main constituents) inside the chlorosomes have put them in a lamellar organization, where the long farnesol tails of the bacteriochlorophyll intermix with carotenoids and each other, forming a structure resembling a lipid multilayer. Recently, another study has determined the organization of the bacteriochlorophyll molecules in green sulfur bacteria. Because they have been so difficult to study, the chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria are the last class of light- harvesting complexes to be characterized structurally by scientists. Each individual chlorosome has a unique organization and this variability in composition had prevented scientists from using X-ray crystallography to characterize the internal structure. To get around this problem, the team used a combination of different experimental approaches. Genetic techniques to create a mutant bacterium with a more regular internal structure, cryo- electron microscopy to identify the larger distance constraints for the chlorosome, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the chlorosome's component chlorophyll molecules, and modeling to bring together all of the pieces and create a final picture of the chlorosome. To create the mutant, three genes were inactivated that green sulfur bacteria acquired late in their evolution. In this way it was possible to go backward in evolutionary time to an intermediate state with much less variable and better ordered chlorosome organelles than the wild-type. The chlorosomes were isolated from the mutant and the wild-type forms of the bacteria. Cryo-electron microscopy was used to take pictures of the chlorosomes. The images reveal that the chlorophyll molecules inside chlorosomes have a nanotube shape. The team then used MAS NMR spectroscopy to resolve the microscopic arrangement of chlorophyll inside the chlorosome. With distance constraints and DFT ring current analyses the organization was found to consist of unique syn-anti monomer stacking. The combination of NMR, cryo- electron microscopy and modeling enabled the scientists to determine that the chlorophyll molecules in green sulfur bacteria are arranged in helices. In the mutant bacteria, the chlorophyll molecules are positioned at a nearly 90-degree angle in relation to the long axis of the nanotubes, whereas the angle is less steep in the wild-type organism. The structural framework can accommodate disorder to improve the biological light harvesting function, which implies that a less ordered structure has a better performance. An alternative energy source The interactions that lead to the assembly of the chlorophylls in chlorosomes are rather simple and the results may one day be used to build artificial photosynthetic systems that convert solar energy to electricity or biofuel.

Although Basildon District Council had granted permission for the site to be used by small number of Traveller families, no planning permission was given for the expansion of the site into land located within the Green Belt. The establishment of the illegal plots led to Basildon District Council conducting a ten-year legal battle in the High Court to gain a clearance order to evict the Travellers from Dale Farm. The decision to bring in police officers to remove some activists and residents from the site, in order to give safe access to the contracted bailiffs, gained international press coverage, with the overall eviction costing the council £4.8 million. Dale Farm Dale Farm is a six-acre plot of land on Oak Lane, near the A127 Southend Arterial road. Dale Farm has been subject to Green Belt controls since 1982. Next to the Dale Farm site there is an authorised Travellers' site known as Oak Lane. This has council planning permission, and provides 34 legal pitches. Dale Farm cottage was leased to Ray Bocking, a scrap metal dealer in the early 1960s, who lived at the Dale Farm cottage. Land in the north-east corner was used as a scrap yard without planning permission until 2001. Mr Bocking said that the Dale Farm site \\"was originally concreted over by Basildon Council\\". Basildon council deny this, although a contractor who worked for the previous owner said, \\"Basildon council regularly brought waste tarmac and rubble from roadworks and dumped it on Dale Farm for a period of 10 years until the 1990s.\\" Basildon Council says \\"it served enforcement notices against [him] in 1992 and 1994 and council contractors did not put down any hardstanding on the farm.\\" Eventually Bocking was bankrupted by costs arising from breaching the Green Belt provisions. The council rejected his bid for permission to continue his business in 1996. During the 1970s, 40 English Romani Gypsy families were allowed to live beside the scrap yard. As a site for Travellers, Dale Farm was started in the 1980s when a planning appeal was won by two families against Basildon District Council on the southern end of the site with the help of Robert Home, a professor of land management from Anglia Ruskin University (now retired). Home also claimed that although it was in the Green Belt, even 30 years ago the area was described as mixed use. In the 1990s, the council ceded limited permission to the Gypsy families adjoining Dale Farm, before deciding against granting further permissions as other parts of the site were occupied.The man who helped create Dale Farm BBC News online 15 October 2011. Retrieved 15 October 2011. On Robert Home, see his webpage at Anglia Ruskin University. Traveller William Saunders won permission for himself and other family members at the adjacent Oak Lane site after a lengthy legal tussle with Basildon Council from 1987.Jon Austin, \\"How did Dale Farm get so big?\\" Echo News 9 December 2006 A planning application by travellers for a 20-pitch site was submitted in 2001, but was refused by the council. Two Irish travellers, Patrick Egan and John Sheridan, and a third man purchased the cottage and the green fields around it from Mr Bocking for £120,000 in 2002. The local residents reported a clear difference between the behaviour of the English Gypsies and the Irish travellers. Around that time more Irish travellers began to arrive and the Gypsies decided to move on. At this time unplanned development started. The site quickly expanded from eight plots to more than 30 by 2003. New residents who moved on to the site did not obtain planning permission for their caravans and chalets. Various planning breaches were reported. The Council has said that planning applications for the caravans and chalets on the site were rejected because the land was Green Belt. Basildon Council first served enforcement notices in 2001 and the Traveller families brought legal action. The enforcement notices ordered that the land be restored to its original state. The Travellers residing there applied for retrospective planning permission, prompting a series of public inquiries. Each of these ruled that the site was illegal. A temporary order was granted in 2003 by the then Secretary of State, John Prescott which allowed residents two years before eviction. In reference to this, the government's Communities and Local Government department, in their report on Site Provision and Enforcement for Gypsies and Travellers, in, wrote: > The site has a long and contentious planning history. Temporary permission > was granted by the Secretary of State ... with the intention that this would > give the site residents and the local authority time to find a suitable > alternative site.

The site continued to expand, and the Travellers residing there applied for a judicial review of the eviction decision. Basildon Council's Development Control Committee minutes state that: \\"In June 2005, once the two-year compliance period had lapsed, the Council resolved that direct action was necessary to secure compliance with the notices. It was this decision (reconsidered in December 2007) that was then made the subject of Judicial Review proceedings, which were heard in February 2008.\\" The Traveller residents won this decision in the High Court in May 2008, only to see it overturned by the Court of Appeal at the beginning of 2010. In 2008, Essex County Council's Racial Equality Council funded a £12,000 community centre at the site, built without planning permission.  The Dale Farm Travellers  An article in the local newspaper, the Echo, quotes an English Romany Gypsy, Joe Jones, that the site was first stopped at by Travelling families during the 1970s. The article reported that residents of the nearby village claim the \\"influx\\" of Irish Travellers which followed in 2001–2002 caused a rise in conflict with the \\"settled community\\" and that most of the \\"English Travellers\\" to have subsequently \\"sold up as they are said not to mix\\" with the Irish Travellers. In 2002 a land dispute allegedly led to the death by shooting of Billy Williams, for which Oak Lane Traveller Paul Saunders was found innocent. Note: there seem to be no reports of this incident on-line until this 2006 reference Ownership of the unauthorised portion appeared to rest with the Sheridan family of Travellers. Richard Sheridan is the chairman of the Dale Farm Housing Association. He is also a former chair of the British Gypsy Council (GCECWCR). A reporter for the Echo claimed that some Travellers are linked to driveway surfacing in continental Europe, and door to door sales of electrical goods in Australia and Iceland, some of a \\"dangerous or counterfeit\\" nature. The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that \\"new evidence has emerged\\" that some residents have cultural roots in the town of Rathkeale, County Limerick, Ireland, and some own property there. The newspaper said of the residents: \\"They deny any connections, yet some of them appear on deeds of homes, others on planning applications for houses and yet more on the electoral register.\\" It also notes that Matthew Brindley, of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain, said: \\"Some people might have property elsewhere but the vast majority do not.\\" Jake Fulton, of Save Dale Farm, said: \\"If this is true I would be very surprised.\\" The Travellers also have links to the local area, with many of their children attending a local Crays Hill school in Billericay. Early in the morning of 19 May 2005, a fire swept through a chalet, killing both John and Cathleen McCarthy and destroying three adjacent caravans.Tragic deaths at fire The Council has questioned why pitches in the legal part of the site are usually unoccupied. However, \\"Grattan Puxon, a campaigner for Travellers, said the owners would spend much of the year travelling. ... and some of the plots also had to be vacated before the electricity company carried out work at some of the plots\\" Robert Home stated in a telephone interview that > \\"the travellers [sic] would normally be on the road between April and > October and use a more permanent site over the winter months. But many had > remained at Dale Farm for a longer period to counter the threat of > eviction.\\" In February 2009, Billericay MP John Baron urged the priest of the local Catholic Church in Wickford to use his \\"influence to persuade the travellers to leave the site to avoid confrontations over the eviction\\". The priest responded that instead, he would be joining the anti-eviction protests, and that the church had already offered to provide temporary shelter for mothers and children of the community.  2011 eviction  In October 2011, a legal process that had taken ten years, reaching as far as the Court of Appeal, concluded with the ruling that Basildon Council has acted lawfully in refusing planning permission for the disputed portion of Dale Farm. Prior to the clearance of the illegally occupied portion of the site, the entirety of Dale Farm contained about 100 families. On 15 March 2011, Basildon Council voted 28 to 10 to move 86 families from Dale Farm. During a series of secret talks over the following six months between Travellers leader Richard Sheridan, council leader Tony Ball and head of planning Dawn French, the Travellers demanded £6 million to relocate to authorised and potential new sites outside Basildon. On 4 July, eviction notices were served on some 90 families living on the illegal half of the Dale Farm site, giving them until 31 August 2011 to leave. The eviction date was set for the week beginning 19 September 2011, and electricity supplies to the site were planned to be cut off on the morning of the eviction. On 26 August a temporary 50 mph. speed limit was applied to a two-mile stretch of the A127 carriageway by Essex County Council, anticipating an influx of slow-moving caravans and trucks joining the road when the eviction commenced. Local road blocks were then introduced in areas surrounding Dale Farm. Farmers in the area blockaded their entrances to prevent illegal occupation of their land. The British firm of bailiffs, Constant and Co., was given the £2.2 million contract to clear 54 pitches at Dale Farm. On 15 September the Council asked that the residents \\"peacefully vacate\\" the unauthorised site, and stressed that it would meet its duty to house homeless families as the law demands. On 19 September a mediation offer by Jan Jařab, the regional representative of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, was rejected by the Foreign Office. Camp Constant was a team of human rights monitors, established in a campsite within Dale Farm. The camp was organised by the Dale Farm Solidarity group with the support of the Travellers. A mixture of concerned locals and activists arrived from Britain and various countries in Europe after it was established on 27 August. That morning, a bailiff addressed the residents, expressing health and safety concerns regarding the barricades and the possibly forceful eviction. However, following court evidence given by Mary Sheridan and others, Mr Justice Antony Edwards-Stuart sitting at the High Court in London that day issued an injunction. He stated that the proposed measures 'may go further' than the terms of the enforcement notices. He said the council must notify the families individually about the precise nature of enforcement actions planned against them, and must give them a chance to respond. Enforcement could not occur before 23 September, and water and electricity must not be cut off. Basildon Council said on 20 September: Before the injunction of 19 September, the eviction was expected to involve the removal of around 400 residents, including about 100 children. On 3 October, Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart ruled that Basildon Council could remove caravans from 49 of 54 plots. The council was also told it could remove the majority of concrete pitches on the site, but walls and fences would remain. Travellers had lodged applications for three separate judicial reviews which delayed action. On 13 October, Mr Justice Duncan Ouseley ruled against these appeals, saying residents were constantly violating criminal law and must be removed to prevent \\"the criminal law and the planning system being brought into serious disrepute\\". Lord Justice Jeremy Sullivan, ruling on a referral to the Court of Appeal on 17 October, advised representatives of the Dale Farm residents that they could not challenge the decision by Mr Justice Ouseley. Following the hearing, Tony Ball announced that, with the exception of three plots where 48 hours notice would be provided, that Basildon council would not provide further notice of when the eviction would start. He encouraged the residents and activists to leave peacefully. On behalf of the residents, Mrs. Kathleen McCarthy said that the decision meant that the Travellers would be forced back onto the road. A spokeswoman for the Dale Farm Solidarity group advised on 17 October that the site had gone into \\"lockdown\\" and the perimeter had been reinforced around the 49 plots, in order to resist eviction of the families affected.Dale Farm eviction: Travellers refused appeal bid BBC News online 17 10 2011. Retrieved 17 10 2011 The large metal gates at the front of the site were locked and many other entry points were heavily fortified with metal fencing, barbed wire and other items. BBC correspondent Fergal Keane, who was inside the illegal part of the site, said: At 7 am. on 19 October 2011 the site clearance of Dale Farm began. Electricity was disconnected. Local MP John Baron said: \\"Police are using the minimum force required and when you are being pelted with bricks and rocks you are entitled to defend yourself.\\" A Labour MEP for the region, Richard Howitt, said: \\"The smoke above Dale Farm is the most visible sign of the failure of Basildon Council to seek a mediated solution.\\"BBC – eviction starts with violence Accessed 21 October 2011. More than 100 riot police entered the site through the rear fence, and two people were tasered.Guardian – Police tasers Accessed 21 October 2011. About 200 bailiffs followed after 12 pm to begin removing illegally erected buildings. Some of the residents had to be forcibly removed, whilst others left voluntarily. Police spent most of that afternoon removing people from the 12-metre high scaffold tower on the front gate, with the help of cherry pickers. Around 4:45 pm. on 20 October, a number of Dale Farm Travellers and supporters walked out of the site. Removal of mobile homes on the site by the bailiffs beganEcho News – live updates and media access to the site was restricted for several days.  Post-eviction  On 5 November 2011, following indications that Travellers intended to return to the site, Basildon Council was awarded an order at the High Court to prevent the former residents illegally reoccupying the site. On 7 November, an application by Dale Farm neighbour and property developer Len Gridley to the High Court to force the Basildon Council to remove debris from the illegal site was denied. His garden backs on to Dale Farm and he has received public death threats. Gridley said the delay in clearing the site has decreased the value of his property, and has criticised the council's decision to allow the size of the legal site to be increased without planning permission. Essex Police said that there were 34 arrests at the site for offences including violent disorder, breach of the peace and obstruction on 19 and 20 October. A police spokesman said all of the people arrested were activists, not Travellers. Basildon Council successfully prosecuted two people for obstructing a bailiff and issued cautions to 10 people. It later dropped the prosecution of 14 others. On 17 May 2012, the High Court ruled that Essex Police could not order media groups to release 100 hours of broadcast and unbroadcast material of the eviction. The Council had said that it planned to return the site to open land, which would take several weeks. They were required to restore any walls and fences damaged during clearance. Since its clearance, the site has been left mostly derelict and overgrown by natural vegetation. In August 2012 the British Environment Agency collected soil samples from the cleared site for three days. Council contractors entered the site in March 2013 to remove asbestos from a small section; Council leader Tony Ball said the action was necessary because abatement notices had been ignored. Basildon intended to recover the costs from the landowners concerned. The agency reported in May 2013 that there was no significant health risk. In July 2014, a woman won a £15,000 compensation payout from Essex Police. She claimed that she was assaulted while taking part in the protests against the eviction.  New site  By April 2012, 83 families displaced by the eviction – including 100 children – had camped on Oak Lane, the private road leading to the former site, and also in the adjoining authorised site. Dale Farm resident Mary O’Brien said that \\"Tony Ball knows that we have nowhere else to go\\". The Council development control committee voted in December 2012 to send bailiffs in to move the caravans, subject to a High Court judicial review. However, in February 2013, Basildon approved a plan for 15 double caravan pitches at a government-owned site in Gardiners Lane South, about 700 yards' distance from Dale Farm. The Council will lease the land from the Homes and Communities Agency.  Cost  After the decision to clear the site, the Council prepared budgetary statements for costs, with a worst case expense estimated at £8 million. Before the injunction of 19 September, the Council said that \\"The estimated direct operational cost of £6.5m together with estimated post operational costs of £1.5m produce a total of £8m.\\" Predictions of the total cost of eviction varied up to £18 million, including legal costs. In 2012 Basildon Council confirmed that the Dale Farm eviction cost them £4.8 million. This amount included £1.6 million due to contractor expenses resulting from the High Court injunction in September. Essex Police announced that its costs were £2.4 million, and the Home Office had pledged to contribute up to £4.65 million to policing costs. The Department for Communities and Local Government also contributed £1.2 million. Basildon Council intended to recover costs from the landowners after the clearance, however these efforts failed, partly because of the difficulty of identifying landowners' whereabouts. Legal aid to residents from 2005 to September 2011 totalled £188,000; costs were paid by the Legal Services Commission. During later court hearings the travellers were represented on a pro-bono basis.  Commentary and media The Peace and Progress Party has advocated on behalf of the Travellers at Dale Farm. The party called a meeting at Parliament in June 2006, following which actor and activist Corin Redgrave collapsed at a council meeting at Basildon Town Hall. In their Annual Report and Accounts for 2006/7. the former Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) said: > In 2005, we reported that we had obtained leave to intervene in a judicial > review case involving a decision by a local authority to evict a large group > of Irish Travellers from an unauthorised encampment on the Dale Farm site in > Basildon in 2005.

As the largest travellers' site in Britain, Dale Farm drew much media interest. The site was featured on the Channel 5 reality programme At War with Next Door in December 2006. Archived 2008 It was also featured on the \\"Children of the Road\\" episode of the CBBC series My Life, and in the Channel 4 series, Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. In July 2011, the expected eviction of the Travellers was the subject of the BBC television documentary entitled The Big Gypsy Eviction. On 19 September 2011, Channel 4's documentary Dispatches: The Fight For Dale Farm covered the relationship between travellers, residents affected by encampments, and the law. In November 2011 the BBC apologised to Basildon Council after an investigation found that the One Show had broadcast a clip on the Dale Farm eviction that was biased towards the Travellers. The five-minute segment was broadcast on 14 February that year.

He is one of ten known British millionaires in 1799. He was the father of Sir Robert Peel, twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Background Peel's father Robert Peel and grandfather William Peel(e) were yeomen. They were also engaged in the adult and infant textile industry, then organised on the basis of the domestic system (most of the work being undertaken in the home). Business career Like many others, Peel joined partnerships to raise the capital required to set up spinning mills. These were water powered (usually using the water frame invented by Richard Arkwright), and thus by rivers and powerful streams in country districts. Thus Peel and Yates set up a mill and housing for their workers at Burrs near Bury. As elsewhere, the shortage of labour in the rural districts was mitigated by employing pauper children as 'apprentices', imported from any locality that wanted them off their hands. They were housed in a kind of hostel. Sir Robert Peel advocated for or sided with progressive reforms in legislation, worker's rights and the first near-national system of vital healthcare (poor law union workhouse trained and dedicated infirmaries) enduring through 19th century Britain and beyond. Through employing a growing workforce and investing in, owning and co-managing a cotton processing/cloth manufacturing business and a calico-printing business he became a millionaire, and lived, as one of his two main homes, at Chamber Hall in Bury, where his more famous son was born. Peel was listed as a subscriber to the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal navigation in 1791. He also built the first factory in nearby Radcliffe. Political career In politics, Peel was a 'Church and King' Tory and a staunch supporter of William Pitt the Younger. This was unusual, as many of the Lancashire mill owners were nonconformist and radical in their outlook. In 1790 he was elected Member of Parliament for Tamworth, having bought the borough along with Lord Bath's estate in the area, and carried these principles into political life. He made Drayton Manor in Staffordshire his principal residence and started to adopt the lifestyle of a country gentleman. In 1800 he was created a Baronet, of Drayton Manor in the County of Stafford and of Bury in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Concerned at the working conditions for children in the cotton industry, and even more concerned that some of his mills had been run by their 'overseers' (managers) contrary to his own paternalistic intentions, in 1802, he introduced the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act which tended to limit the hours that apprentice children worked in the mills, and obliged the mill owners to provide some form of schooling. In 1815, at the urging of Robert Owen, he introduced a Bill introducing stricter limits on the hours children (whether or not apprentices) could work in textile mills; in 1819 this was passed (heavily amended, and applying only to the cotton industry) as the Cotton Mills and Factories Act. In 1817, he retired from business, the various partnerships which had operated his mills being dissolved.Two advertisements (one for the Tamworth calico printing business, the other for the Bury works) both beginning In the 1818 General Election, Peel and his son William had been the two MPs returned by Tamworth in a contested election; in 1820 Peel left Parliament (restoring the general custom at Tamworth of returning un-contested one MP of the proprietor's choosing and one representing other local interests). Family Peel married as his first wife Ellen Yates (the daughter of his partner) on 8 July 1783. They had eleven children, including: *Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. *William Yates Peel, MP and politician. married Lady Jane Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell and his wife Margaret King. *Edmund Peel, MP and politician *General Jonathan Peel, soldier, politician and owner of racehorses (including 'Orlando', the winner of the 'Running Rein' Derby of 1844) *Laurence Peel (b. 1801), MP and politician, who married Lady Jane Lennox, daughter of Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond; described by one historian as \\"the youngest and least talented, but perhaps the most personally attractive of the Peel brothers\\". *Harriet Peel, who married the 2nd Baron Henley. *Mary Peel who married George Robert Dawson (politician); great-great-grandparents to Lord Moyola. Peel had high hopes for his children, especially his eldest son, Robert, who he would make repeat the substance of each Sunday's sermon after mass. Peel accepted that he would not mingle with high society, but intended to prepare his son to be able to. In 1799 he (or his immediate family benefit trust) was estimated the seventh-wealthiest small family unit in Britain, owning £1.5M ().\\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\", The Guardian, feature, 29 Sep 1999 https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/sep/29/features11.g2 He was one of ten known British millionaires in 1799. After the death of his first wife, Peel married Susanna Clerke (sister of Sir William Clerke) on 18 October 1805. The marriage was unsuccessful and the couple eventually separated, with Susanna moving to Warwickshire. She died on 10 September 1824. Sir Robert was at the time unwell and his children represented him at the funeral.Gash, 33. In April 1830, Sir Robert was growing frail, though he still played whist until he was too weak to deal. He was too proud to allow his nephew to deal for him, so stopped playing. Peel died in his armchair, peacefully and without anyone noticing until hours later. In a biography of his son Robert, by Douglas Hurd (Con), it states Peel had \\"a good life, well sustained by family pleasures, worldly success, orthodox Christian faith and a strong practical mind\\". His funeral was attended by the entire \\"corporation of Tamworth\\" and sixty tenants on horseback. His will was a paradigm of primogeniture. He in most notable legacies left what transpired to be about £38,500 each to four of his sons, leaving Robert with all his land plus four times that sum; he had given already Robert £330,000 during his lifetime and willed him a further £154,000.

He was the third son and successor of the warlord Yuan Shao. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Yuan Shang was described as \\"strong but arrogant\\", and he was his father's favourite son. Usurpation of Yuan Shao's legacy It is documented in the Records of the Three Kingdoms and Dianlue that Yuan Shao favoured Yuan Shang due to his good looks, and he preferred Yuan Shang to be his choice for succession.Sanguozhi vol. 6. However, Yuan Shao was never able to finalise on his decision regarding who should succeed him as the Governor of Ji Province. Following Yuan Shao's death in 202, many of his followers suggested that his eldest son, Yuan Tan, should assume control of the Yuan family's assets, as tradition dictated, but Yuan Shang and his supporters would not yield. Apprehensive that Yuan Tan's succession would harm their future, Shen Pei and Pang Ji, two influential advisers, supported Yuan Shang and pushed for him to succeed Yuan Shao.Sanguozhi vol. 6. When Yuan Tan rushed back from his duty elsewhere, he could not revert the situation so instead he appointed himself General of Chariots and Cavalry (). The relationship between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang greatly deteriorated due to this event. Cao Cao, the warlord who defeated Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, resumed his offensive to the north and attacked the Yuan brothers in 202. Yuan Tan stationed his troops in Liyang (northeast of present-day Xun County, Henan) against the attack, but his request for more troops was turned down by his brother, who feared Yuan Tan would take over military control.Sanguozhi vol. 6. Yuan Shang then left Shen Pei to defend Ye and personally led a force to Liyang to assist in the defences. The war dragged on for about half a year until Yuan Shang's forces suffered a major defeat outside the city gates. Apprehensive of being locked up inside the city, Yuan Shang fled under the cover of night, but was trailed to Ye, where Cao Cao took all the wheat around. Fighting with Yuan Tan and Cao Cao Cao Cao's adviser, Guo Jia, suggested that the Yuan brothers would fight between themselves in the absence of an external enemy.Sanguozhi vol. 14. Cao Cao accepted Guo Jia's counsel and withdrew his troops to attack Liu Biao in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Meanwhile, Yuan Shang battled with his brother, and forced Yuan Tan to flee to Pingyuan (), where Yuan Shang laid siege. Since Yuan Shang's attack was so intense, Yuan Tan had no other way but to send out Xin Pi to seek alliance with Cao Cao.Sanguozhi vol. 6. Cao Cao agreed and even arranged a marriage between one of his sons and Yuan Tan's daughter. As Cao Cao was moving north, Yuan Shang was forced to lift the siege and went back to Ye, but en route to Ye, Yuan Shang was defeated and fled to Zhongshan. The brothers Lü Kuang () and Lü Xiang (), who served under Yuan Shang, surrendered to Cao Cao and were enfeoffed as marquises. While Cao Cao was laying siege to Ye, Yuan Tan took the opportunity to attack Yuan Shang, and forced the latter to seek refuge alongside his second brother, Yuan Xi, who at that time was the Inspector of You Province. During Yuan Shang's stay in You Province, a mutiny broke out, and the two brothers were then forced to flee to Liaoxi, where the Wuhuan tribes resided.Sanguozhi vol. 6. In 207, the Yuan brothers, along with the Wuhuan leader Tadun, fought at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain against Cao Cao. During the battle, the unit of Tadun was surprise-attacked by Cao Cao's vanguard, Zhang Liao, and the allied forces was soon defeated after the capture of Tadun. Death This time Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi fled to Liaodong, where they planned to take shelter under the warlord Gongsun Kang. However, they were betrayed by Gongsun Kang, who executed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Some of the medieval coats of arms are rather simple of design, while others have more naturalistic charges. The king-granted coats of arms of later times were usually detailed and complex. Especially in the late 17th century and the 18th century, many ennobled persons and families received coats of arms with shields containing both two and four fields, and some even with an inescutcheon above these. There are very few civic arms dating from before 1900, and most of today's governmental and civic arms are from the last decades of the 20th century. Today the public arms are popular in Norway and are used extensively by the official authorities. The Norwegian Heraldry Society is a private heraldic organisation. Private heraldry and coats of arms 250px History Coats of arms in early medieval times were quite simple and of a rather basic design, when they were to be used in tournaments and other battles. The eldest Norwegian personal arms are known only from seals of the late 13th and the early 14th centuries. Most of the arms in the seals are not simple and have several charges combined, e.g. a griffin holding a bird (Bjarne Erlingsson 1288), two crossed axes and a fleur-de-lis (Jon Kollr 1297), and a fleur-de- lis between two roses on a fess (Baron Snare Aslaksson 1303).H.J. Huitfeldt- Kaas m.fl.: Norske Sigiller fra Middelalderen, Oslo 1899-1950, No. 2, 4 and 31. The Dano-Norwegian union kings started to grant nobility and personal arms in the 15th Century. In the late 17th Century and during the 18th Century, many ennobled persons were granted arms with shields having two and four fields (e.g. Peter Tordenskiold), a few even with an escutcheon over all (e.g. Ludvig Holberg) and some with two supporters (e.g. Bernt Anker). Arms were self-assumed in Norway and not a privilege for nobles. When nobility was granted by the union kings, even new arms were granted, often being the ennobled person's former arms with some additional charges (e.g. Herman Løvenskiold in 1739). Many of the ennobled person had direct influence on their new arms, especially those who paid a considerable amount of money to the king himself for the ennoblement (e.g. Gyldenkrantz). Noble heraldic privileges The Norwegian nobility had no real heraldic privileges, as it was allowed for all citizens to assume their own coats of arms. In letters patent to the nobility, however, it was expressly granted a legal protection for their new arms. After 1814 there has been no such granting of nobility and arms in Norway. Unlike in Sweden, the use of open helmets was not reserved for the nobility. Coronets and supporters were formally reserved for the nobility, but they were used also by a number of others, without any protests from the public authorities. Supporters were normally granted to counts and higher ranks, but they were also granted to untitled nobility (e.g. Anker) and barons (e.g. Ludvig Holberg). Noble coronets (Norwegian: adelskrone or rangkrone) were in principle for the nobility only. There were specific coronets for counts, barons, and untitled nobles. In addition, the Gyldenløver (\\"Golden Lions\\"), who were illegitimate royal descendants, had an exclusive coronet. The coronets for the nobility were, however, also used in arms and monograms by many burghers and peasants, e. g. in seals on the Norwegian Constitution of May 17, 1814, for the peasants Syvert Eeg and Christopher Hoen. The use of physical coronets is not known in Norway.P. B. Grandjean: Dansk Heraldik, Copenhagen 1919, pages 205-212 only refers to such coronets as parts of coats of arms. Usage before and now Coats of arms were in older times relatively frequent, used by nobles as well as citizens and farmers. There are today comparatively few personal coats of arms in Norway, especially in active use, and many of them are of foreign origin. Many Norwegian family arms have been created and established by private individuals and needed no grant or confirmation by any official authorities. Not many Norwegian family arms are those of former noble families.

Official heraldry and coats of arms Regulation New private coats of arms need no official sanction and there is no legislation, official regulation or registration of such arms. The situation is different with the national and royal arms, the arms of military and civil governmental bodies, counties and municipalities; they are sanctioned by the King and they are protected by the Norwegian Penal Code. For royal sanction of new coats of arms, the municipalities must apply to the Ministry of Local Government. This will then consult with the National Archives Office, which must recommend it to the government for the municipality to obtain the required Royal Decree. Official and public coats of arms may only be used in official duties by offices of state, counties, and municipalities. There are several regulations for such use, i.a. that the arms must be placed at the top of the page on which they are printed. There is no special Norwegian heraldic authority but the government uses the National Archives of Norway as expert consultant for municipal arms. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the heraldic authority for use of the national coat of arms and the symbolic royal crown. State and civic heraldry A few Norwegian cities were granted arms (or seals with similar emblems) by the union kings: Kristiansand 1643, Halden 1665, Kristiansund and Molde 1742, Holmestrand and Lillehammer 1898. Today practically all Norwegian municipalities and all counties have their own coat of arms and corresponding banner of arms as their flag. They usually have just one tincture and one metal, they are very simple in design, easy for blazoning, and very strong in symbolism. Some coats of arms are allowed to break from these rules if they are a revival of an old coat of arms with connection to the area.Hans Cappelen: «Norwegian Simplicity.

Scandinavian heraldry society. Accessed 2009-06-20. The military also uses heraldry, and for this purpose, Major General Torbjørn Bergersen designed arms for all units in the Norwegian Army.

Accessed 2009-06-20 House marks and monogrammes Bumerke (plural: bumerker), rarely spelled bomerke, are house marks with some relations to coats of arms,Hans Cappelen: «Bumerker i Norge – en oversikt», in Anders Bjønnes et al.: Segltegninger fra hyllingene i Norge 1591 og 1610, ed by Norsk Slektshistorisk Forening, Oslo 2010. as they were frequently used instead of arms, often displayed within an escutcheon or a shield. House marks were used for several purposes and like coats of arms, they were often used on private seals and signet rings. Coats of arms consist of coloured fields whilst house marks consist of simple lines only, suitable for carving on e.g. wooden utensils. They are renditions of very simple runic-like letters and other graphic symbols which signify a specific person or family. They may be passed down through generations with some changes from person to person. This custom has mostly died out. Before literacy became widespread, a bumerke would often be used instead of a signature. Some bumerkes consist of monogrammes which are owner's name initials. Most bumerkes are not monogrammes, and a monogramme is not automatically a bumerke. However, monogrammes were often used for the same purposes as bumerkes, e.g. when signing documents or marking personal belongings.

He initially served directly under the central government of the Eastern Han dynasty. Later, he served under the warlord Sun Ce and then under the warlord Cao Cao. He continued to serve in the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms period. Biography As a clerk in Gaotang County, Hua Xin was nominated as xiaolian, and appointed as Langzhong (郎中). In 187, Hua was appointed as Shangshu Lang (尚书郎). When Dong Zhuo evacuated the court from Luoyang to Chang'an, Hua requested a position as the administrator of Shanggui County (上邽) . He encountered Yuan Shu's army en route and was accepted to the latter's court. However, Hua left after his advice for Yuan to attack Dong Zhuo was dismissed. In 192, Hua was appointed as the administrator of Yuzhang (豫章) Commandery. After Liu Yao, governor of Yang Province died, his troops were willing to transfer the commandership to Hua. Hua declined, believing it to be inappropriate as an official of the Han. He joined the forces of Sun Ce as the latter was preparing the conquest of Jiangdong. Sun treated him as an honored guest. Sanguozhi vol. 13. In 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, the imperial court under Cao Cao called Hua back to Luoyang. Sun Quan was hesitant to allow him to go, but Hua convinced Sun that his departure would be a sign of goodwill to Cao Cao. Eventually, Hua replaced Xun Yu as the Shangshu Ling (尚书令, Prefect of the Masters of Writing). In 213, Hua was Junshi (军师, military advisor) in Cao's war against Sun Quan. In 217, Hua became the first Grandee Secretary (御史大夫) in the Kingdom of Wei. In 220, Hua became the Chancellor of Wei, and the Marquis of Anle Ting (安乐亭侯). In 221, Hua was appointed the Minister over the Masses. In 226, Hua was granted the Marquis of Boping (博平侯), and appointed as Grand Commandant.

In 1819, he was apprenticed to architect Francis Goodwin for whom he worked until 1826. He then studied at the Royal Academy School. His designs for churches shown at exhibitions in 1824 and 1827 aroused considerable interest. From 1834 to 1843, he worked in partnership with Henry Francis Lockwood in Hull, where they designed a number of Neo-classical buildings, such as Hull Trinity House (1839), extensions to Hull Royal Infirmary (1840) and Great Thornton Street Church (1843); the pair also designed the expansion of the Brownlow Hill workhouse in Liverpool (1842-1843). Allom later designed many buildings in London, including a workhouse in Marloes Road, Kensington (1847), the Church of Christ in Highbury in 1850, the Church of St Peter's in Notting Hill in 1856, and parts of the Ladbroke Estate in west London.

He also worked with Sir Charles Barry on numerous projects, including the Houses of Parliament and the remodelling of Highclere Castle. Topographical illustrator However, Allom is chiefly known for his numerous topographical works, which were used to illustrate books on travel. From the 1820s onwards, he travelled extensively through the UK and mainland Europe. In 1832 he published Westmorland, Durham and Northumberland Illustrated from Original Drawings by Thomas Allom (three volumes). In 1834 Allom arrived in Istanbul, Turkey, and produced hundreds of drawings during journeys through Anatolia, Syria and Palestine. The results of this expedition were published in 1838 in Constantinople and the Scenery of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor published in two volumes with text by Robert Walsh. Emily Reeve's Character and Costume in Turkey and Italy, published in London in 1840, was also illustrated with engravings by Allom.

Rider\\" in April 1926 entitled \\"Corrina Blues\\" which contains a verse in a similar vein: The Mississippi Sheiks also recorded \\"Sweet Maggie\\" in the 1930s: Blues recordings Notable early singers to record the song included Blind Lemon Jefferson (1926), Bo Carter (1928), Charlie McCoy (1928), Tampa Red (1929, 1930), James \\"Boodle It\\" Wiggins (1929), Frankie \\"Half Pint\\" Jaxon (1929), Walter Davis (1939), Johnny Temple (1940), and Big Joe Turner (1941). Veteran blues artists recorded for the revival market include Mississippi John Hurt (1966) and Mance Lipscomb (1968). Postwar-blues artists recording the song included Taj Mahal and Snooky Pryor. Jazz recordings Among the musicians to record the song were Wilbur Sweatman, Red Nichols (1930). Cab Calloway (1931), Art Tatum (1941), the Black Sorrows (1985), and Natalie Cole. Early country recordings Several recordings were made for the country market by artists including Clayton McMichen (1929) and the Cajun musician Leo Soileau (1935). Western swing recordings In 1934, Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies recorded the song under the title \\"Where Have You Been So Long, Corrinne,\\" as a Western swing dance song. Shortly thereafter, Bob Wills adapted it again as \\"Corrine, Corrina,\\" also in the Western swing style. Following his recording with the Texas Playboys (OKeh 06530) on April 15, 1940, the song entered the standard repertoire of all Western swing bands, influencing the adoption of \\"Corrine, Corrina\\" by Cajun bands and later by individual country artists.Clayton, The Roots of Texas Music, p. 23: \\"For example, 'Corrine, Corrina,' now considered a Cajun standard, probably was originally an African American blues song. In the 1930s, it was adapted to western swing by Bob Wills, and, from there, worked its way into the standard Cajun repertoire, changing slightly with each transformation.\\" \\"Corrine, Corrina\\" is also an important song related to Western swing's pioneering use of electrically amplified stringed instruments. It was one of the songs recorded during a session in Dallas on September 28, 1935, by Roy Newman and His Boys (OKeh 03117).Govenar, Deep Ellum and Central Track, p. 243: \\"Dallas, September 28, 1935 ... DAL 181, Corrine, Corrina, Vo/OK 03117.\\" Their guitarist, Jim Boyd, played what is the first use of an electrically amplified guitar found on a recording.Dempsey, The Light Crust Doughboys Are on the Air, p.120: \\"[Jim] Boyd, who played bass and guitar in his on-and-off career with the Doughboys that continued into the 1990s, receives credit from some researchers with what may be the first recorded use of an electric guitar. It occurred in a September 1935 session with the group Roy Newman and His Boys, who played on Dallas radio station WRR. They recorded 'Shine On Harvest Moon,' Corrine, Corrina' and 'Hot Dog Stomp'.\\" Cliff Bruner's Texas Wanderers also recorded an early version of Chatmon's song on February 5, 1937 (Decca 5350). Folk music revival \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" entered the folk-like acoustical tradition during the American folk music revival of the 1960s when Bob Dylan began playing a version he titled \\"Corrina, Corrina\\". Although his blues-based version contains lyrics and song structure from \\"Corrine Corrina\\", his melody is lifted from \\"Stones in My Passway\\" (Vocalion 3723) recorded by Robert Johnson in 1937. Dylan's version, found on his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, also borrows lyrics taken from Johnson's song: :I got a bird that whistles, I got a bird that sings (2×) The Rising Sons, featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder, recorded the song as \\"Corinna, Corinna\\" before breaking up in 1966. Taj Mahal then recorded another version in 1968 titled \\"Corinna\\". Joni Mitchell covered the song in 1988 on her album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm, with the title \\"A Bird That Whistles (Corrina Corrina)\\", and adding a flight-evoking Wayne Shorter sax solo. Other artists who have recorded the song include Eric Clapton, who sings it as \\"Alberta, Alberta\\", Willie Nelson, Steve Gillette, Leo Kottke, and Conor Oberst. The English roots band Show of Hands also performed the song on their live album As You Were, released in 2005 under the duo's own label Hands on Music. The Band (featuring Miranda Sykes as a special guest for this part of the album) used the Dylan/Johnson version of the song. Rock music Big Joe Turner recorded a rendition of the song for Atlantic Records in 1956. Ray Peterson's 1960 version, produced by Phil Spector, reached number nine on the Billboard chart. Jerry Lee Lewis included a version on his 1965 album, The Return of Rock. Bill Haley & His Comets released a rock n' roll version on Decca Records on their album Bill Haley's Chicks in 1959. Steppenwolf recorded it as \\"Corina, Corina\\" for Steppenwolf Live, released in April 1970. Rod Stewart recorded a rendition between 2011 and 2013, and it is featured as a bonus track on his Time album. Boz Scaggs included it on his 2013 album Memphis. Country music Dean Martin, better known as a crooner, included the song on his second country music album, Dean \\"Tex\\" Martin Rides Again (1963). Asleep at the Wheel recorded the song for their 1993 album A Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills & the Texas Playboys with Brooks & Dunn. Their version peaked at number 73 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1994. Country rock singer Gib Guilbeau recorded a reworked version of the song entitled \\"Alberta Alberta\\" on his self titled 1973 album. References Bibliography *Cheseborough, Steve. \\"Carter, Bo\\".

Initially a minor officer under Wang Lang, the Administrator of Kuaiji Commandery, Yu Fan later served under the warlord Sun Ce, who conquered the territories in the Jiangdong (or Wu) region in a series of campaigns from 194–199. Sun Ce regarded him highly and once enlisted his help in persuading Hua Xin, another commandery administrator, to surrender. After Sun Ce's death, Yu Fan continued serving under Sun Quan, Sun Ce's younger brother and successor, as a Cavalry Commandant. Sun Quan confined him for some time due to his rude and disrespectful behaviour, but released him in 219 and allowed him to accompany the general Lü Meng to attack Jing Province. During the Jing Province campaign, Yu Fan warned Lü Meng about a possible ambush when Lü Meng was celebrating a minor victory, and was proven right later. Yu Fan was known for being very candid, outspoken and direct. As such, he offended Sun Quan several times – including instances when he was drunk – and did not get along well with many of his colleagues. He also mocked and belittled two enemy officers, Yu Jin and Mi Fang, who surrendered to Sun Quan. Sometime in the 220s, Sun Quan could no longer tolerate Yu Fan's disrespectful attitude and banished him to the remote Jiao Province in southern China. Yu Fan lived in exile for over a decade, during which he spent his time lecturing and writing. Even while living in exile, he was still concerned about state affairs, and he once wrote to Sun Quan to advise him against sending a fleet across the sea to attack the warlord Gongsun Yuan in northeastern China, but was ignored. When the fleet sustained heavy losses due to storms, Sun Quan regretted his decision and summoned Yu Fan back, but Yu Fan had already died by then. Historical sources on Yu Fan's life The authoritative historical source on Yu Fan's life is the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), written by Chen Shou in the third century. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the Sanguozhi by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou's original work and adding his personal commentary. The alternative texts used in the annotations to the Sanguozhi are: Wu Shu (吳書; Book of Wu), by Wei Zhao; Yu Fan Biezhuan (虞翻別傳; Unofficial Biography of Yu Fan), by an unknown writer; Jiang Biao Zhuan (江表傳), by Yu Pu; Kuaiji Dianlu (會稽典錄; Esteemed Records of Kuaiji), by an unknown writer. Early life Yu Fan was from Yuyao County (餘姚縣), Kuaiji Commandery,(虞翻字仲翔，會稽餘姚人也， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 57. which is in present- day Yuyao, Zhejiang. The Yu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in the Jiangdong region at the time. At a young age, he was already known for being studious and extraordinary. When he was 11, a guest who came to visit his elder brother ignored the young Yu Fan when he walked past him. Yu Fan later wrote to the guest, \\"I heard that amber does not contain rotten plant material and that magnets do not attract bent needles. Is it not appropriate for you to ignore me when you walked past me?\\" The guest was very surprised after reading Yu Fan's letter. Yu Fan attracted greater attention after this incident.(吳書曰：翻少好學，有高氣。年十二，客有候其兄者，不過翻，翻追與書曰：「僕聞虎魄不取腐芥，磁石不受曲鍼，過而不存，不亦宜乎！」客得書奇之，由是見稱。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Service under Wang Lang When Yu Fan became older, he served as an Officer of Merit (功曹) under Wang Lang, the Administrator (太守) of Kuaiji Commandery. In 196,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 62. the warlord Sun Ce, who was on a series of military campaigns in the Jiangdong (or Wu) region and had already conquered some territories, prepared to attack Kuaiji. Yu Fan was mourning the death of his father when he received news that Sun Ce was going to attack Kuaiji, so he rushed from his home to the commandery office and asked to meet Wang Lang. He was still dressed in mourning garments then. After entering the office, Yu Fan removed his mourning garments and urged Wang Lang to avoid confrontation with Sun Ce. Wang Lang ignored his advice and was defeated in battle by Sun Ce.(... 太守王朗命為功曹。孫策征會稽，翻時遭父喪，衰絰詣府門，朗欲就之，翻乃脫衰入見，勸朗避策。朗不能用，拒戰敗績， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Yu Fan considered bringing Wang Lang north to Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu) to evade Sun Ce, but Wang Lang, who believed in stories about the immortal Wang Fangping (王方平), wanted to travel to the \\"South Mountain\\" and take shelter there. Yu Fan then accompanied Wang Lang as they escaped from Kuaiji Commandery by sea and headed south to Houguan County (候官縣; in present-day Fuzhou, Fujian). At Houguan, the county chief initially denied them entry, but agreed after being persuaded by Yu Fan. In Houguan County, Wang Lang insisted on heading further south to Jiao Province to find the \\"South Mountain\\", but Yu Fan objected and said, \\"Those stories are nonsense. There is no South Mountain in Jiao Province for us to take shelter in.\\"(吳書曰：翻始欲送朗到廣陵，朗惑王方平記，言「疾來邀我，南岳相求」，故遂南行。旣至候官，又欲投交州，翻諫朗曰：「此妄書耳，交州無南岳，安所投乎？」乃止。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57.(... 亡走浮海。翻追隨營護，到東部候官，候官長閉城不受，翻往說之，然後見納。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Wang Lang told Yu Fan later, \\"You have an elderly mother (to take care of). You can go back (to Kuaiji) now.\\"(朗謂翻曰：「卿有老母，可以還矣。」) Sanguozhi vol. 57. The Yu Fan Biezhuan provided a different account of the above events. It mentioned that Wang Lang sent Yu Fan to meet Hua Xin, the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi), and discuss the forming of a military alliance between Wang Lang and Hua Xin against Sun Ce. However, Yu Fan turned back before reaching his destination because he received news that Sun Ce's army was advancing towards Kuaiji Commandery. His father died during that period of time. Yu Fan did not return home immediately because he felt that he was still on a mission. He travelled day and night to Houguan County to meet Wang Lang, who then sent him home to attend his father's funeral.(翻別傳曰：朗使翻見豫章太守華歆，圖起義兵。翻未至豫章，聞孫策向會稽，翻乃還。會遭父喪，以臣使有節，不敢過家，星行追朗至候官。朗遣翻還，然後奔喪。而傳云孫策之來，翻衰絰詣府門，勸朗避策，則為大異。) Yu Fan Biezhuan annotation and Pei Songzhi's note in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Service under Sun Ce Yu Fan was reinstated as an Officer of Merit by Sun Ce after he returned to Kuaiji Commandery. Sun Ce treated him like a friend and visited his residence.(翻旣歸，策復命為功曹，待以交友之禮，身詣翻第。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. The Jiang Biao Zhuan recorded that Sun Ce wrote to Yu Fan: \\"I wish to work together with you from now. Please do not say I treated you like a lowly commandery-level officer.\\"(江表傳曰：策書謂翻曰：「今日之事，當與卿共之，勿謂孫策作郡吏相待也。」) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Sun Ce was very fond of going on hunting excursions. Yu Fan told him: \\"You gathered a mob, used them to rein in the wandering scholar-gentry, and earned their fervent allegiance towards you. Even Emperor Gao of Han can't be compared to you. When you dress casually and venture out, the officials who accompany you usually don't have enough time to prepare for the trip, while the servants and soldiers are getting tiresome. A leader who doesn't behave in a serious manner doesn't command respect. The White Dragon transformed into a fish for fun and ended up being trapped by the fisherman Yuqie (豫且); the White Serpent behaved recklessly and ended up being slain by Liu Bang. I hope you will be more careful.\\" Sun Ce replied: \\"You're right. However, sometimes, when I'm thinking hard, I feel frustrated if I were to sit down and think. As such, I venture out in search of insight and inspiration.\\"(策好馳騁游獵，翻諫曰：「明府用烏集之衆，驅散附之士，皆得其死力，雖漢高帝不及也。至於輕出微行，從官不暇嚴，吏卒常苦之。夫君人者不重則不威，故白龍魚服，困於豫且，白蛇自放，劉季害之，願少留意。」策曰：「君言是也。然時有所思，端坐悒悒，有裨諶草創之計，是以行耳。」) Sanguozhi vol. 57. The Wu Shu recorded that Sun Ce once led a military expedition against the Shanyue and ventured into the hills alone after slaying the Shanyue chief and sending his men to pursue and destroy the remaining Shanyue forces. He encountered Yu Fan, who asked him where his bodyguards were. When Sun Ce told him that he had ordered his bodyguards to join the rest of his men in attacking the Shanyue, Yu Fan exclaimed, \\"This is so dangerous!\\" He then asked Sun Ce to dismount from his horse and said, \\"The terrain here is deep and dangerous. You can't control your horse well under such conditions, so you should travel on foot, guide your horse along, and arm yourself with a bow and arrows. I'm good in using a spear and I'll lead the way.\\" After reaching flat ground, Sun Ce mounted his horse again and asked Yu Fan, \\"You don't have a horse. What are you going to do?\\" Yu Fan replied, \\"I can travel on foot. I'm capable of travelling 300 li in a day. Since the start of the campaigns, no one has been able to match my pace. You can try letting a horse run and I'll catch up with it on foot.\\" They encountered a signaller at the main road. Sun Ce took the signaller's horn and blew it. His men recognised the sound of the horn and rushed there to join him. They patrolled the area and pacified the three commanderies.(吳書曰：策討山越，斬其渠帥，悉令左右分行逐賊，獨騎與翻相得山中。翻問左右安在，策曰：「悉行逐賊。」翻曰：「危事也！」令策下馬：「此草深，卒有驚急，馬不及縈策，但牽之，執弓矢以步。翻善用矛，請在前行。」得平地，勸策乘馬。策曰：「卿無馬柰何？」荅曰：「翻能步行，日可三百里，自征討以來，吏卒無及翻者，明府試躍馬，翻能疏步隨之。」行及大道，得一鼓吏，策取角自鳴之，部曲識聲，小大皆出，遂從周旋，平定三郡。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Persuading Hua Xin to surrender to Sun Ce The Jiang Biao Zhuan recorded that in 199,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 63. when Sun Ce was leading an army to attack Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei), he passed by Yuzhang Commandery along the way and wanted to conquer it. He invited Yu Fan to meet him and asked Yu Fan to persuade the Administrator, Hua Xin, to surrender. Yu Fan travelled to Yuzhang Commandery and succeeded in convincing Hua Xin to surrender by pointing out that he stood no chance against Sun Ce. Hua Xin surrendered to Sun Ce the following day.(江表傳曰：策討黃祖，旋軍欲過取豫章，特請翻語曰：「華子魚自有名字，然非吾敵也。加聞其戰具甚少，若不開門讓城，金鼓一震，不得無所傷害，卿便在前具宣孤意。」翻即奉命辭行，徑到郡，請被褠葛巾與敵相見，謂歆曰：「君自料名聲之在海內，孰與鄙郡故王府君？」歆曰：「不及也。」翻曰：「豫章資糧多少？器仗精否？士民勇果孰與鄙郡？」又曰：「不如也。」翻曰：「討逆將軍智略超世，用兵如神，前走劉揚州，君所親見，南定鄙郡，亦君所聞也。今欲守孤城，自料資糧，已知不足，不早為計，悔無及也。今大軍已次椒丘，僕便還去，明日日中迎檄不到者，與君辭矣。」翻旣去，歆明旦出城，遣吏迎策。) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. After capturing Yuzhang Commandery, Sun Ce led his army back to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), where he rewarded his subjects for their contributions. He told Yu Fan that he heard that many officials serving in the Han imperial capital, Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) had the impression that Jiangdong had no talents, so he wanted to send Yu Fan there to meet them and prove them wrong. He also considered sending Zhang Hong, but he still preferred Yu Fan. Yu Fan refused and said, \\"I'm like one of your treasured possessions. You might lose me if you show me to others and they want me. That's why I don't want to go there.\\" Sun Ce laughed and said, \\"I still have military campaigns to complete so I can't return home yet. You're like my Xiao He. I intend to let you return to Kuaiji as an Officer of Merit to help me guard the commandery.\\" Yu Fan travelled back to Kuaiji Commandery three days later.(策旣定豫章，引軍還吳，饗賜將士，計功行賞，謂翻曰：「孤昔再至壽春，見馬日磾，及與中州士大夫會，語我東方人多才耳，但恨學問不博，語議之間，有所不及耳。孤意猶謂未耳。卿博學洽聞，故前欲令卿一詣許，交見朝士，以折中國妄語兒。卿不願行，便使子綱；恐子綱不能結兒輩舌也。」翻曰：「翻是明府家寶，而以示人，人儻留之，則去明府良佐，故前不行耳。」策笑曰：「然。」因曰：「孤有征討事，未得還府，卿復以功曹為吾蕭何，守會稽耳。」後三日，便遣翻還郡。) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Pei Songzhi commented that the Jiang Biao Zhuan's account of Yu Fan persuading Hua Xin to surrender is less reliable as compared to another account from the Wu Li. He believed that Hua Xin was not militarily weaker than Wang Lang (as suggested in the Jiang Biao Zhuan) and he might have resisted Sun Ce if he was in control of Kuaiji Commandery instead of Yuzhang Commandery.(臣松之以為王、華二公於擾攘之時，抗猛銳之鋒，俱非所能。歆之名德，實高於朗，而江表傳述翻說華，云「海內名聲，孰與於王」，此言非也。然王公拒戰，華逆請服，實由孫策初起，名微衆寡，故王能舉兵，豈武勝哉？策後威力轉盛，勢不可敵，華量力而止，非必用仲翔之說也。若使易地而居，亦華戰王服耳。案吳歷載翻謂歆曰：「竊聞明府與王府君齊名中州，海內所宗，雖在東垂，常懷瞻仰。」歆荅曰：「孤不如王會稽。」翻復問：「不審豫章精兵，何如會稽？」對曰：「大不如也。」翻曰：「明府言不如王會稽，謙光之譚耳；精兵不如會稽，實如尊教。」因述孫策才略殊異，用兵之奇，歆乃荅云當去。翻出，歆遣吏迎策。二說有不同，此說為勝也。) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Events after Sun Ce's death Yu Fan was appointed as the Chief (長) of Fuchun County (富春縣; in present-day Fuyang, Zhejiang) later. When Sun Ce died in the year 200, many county-level officials wanted to travel to Wu Commandery to attend his funeral. Yu Fan disapproved because he was worried that the Shanyue tribes would take advantage of their absence to cause trouble in the counties, hence he remained in Fuchun County but wore mourning garments to express his grief. The other officials followed suit and the area was peaceful.(翻出為富春長。策薨，諸長吏並欲出赴喪，翻曰：「恐鄰縣山民或有姧變，遠委城郭，必致不虞。」因留制服行喪。諸縣皆効之，咸以安寧。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. The Wu Shu and Kuaiji Dianlu recorded an incident involving Sun Hao (孫暠), a cousin of Sun Ce. Sun Hao held the appointment of General of the Household Who Establishes Martial Might (定武中郎將) and was stationed at Wucheng County (烏程縣; in present-day Huzhou, Zhejiang). After Sun Ce died and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan, Sun Hao rallied his subordinates, formed an army, and prepared to attack Kuaiji Commandery. When Yu Fan heard about it, he ordered the people in Kuaiji Commandery to hold their positions and await orders from their new lord (Sun Quan) while he met Sun Hao in person.(吳書曰：策薨，權統事。定武中郎將暠，策之從兄也，屯烏程，整帥吏士，欲取會稽。會稽聞之，使民守城以俟嗣主之命，因令人告諭暠。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. He warned Sun Hao: \\"Our former lord had passed away. Sun Quan is now our new lord. I am prepared to lead everyone in Kuaiji to defend the commandery and eliminate any threat to our new lord. You better reconsider your decision.\\" Sun Hao retreated.(會稽典錄載翻說暠曰：「討逆明府，不竟天年。今攝事統衆，宜在孝廉，翻已與一郡吏士，嬰城固守，必欲出一旦之命，為孝廉除害，惟執事圖之。」於是暠退。) Kuaiji Dianlu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Pei Songzhi pointed out a discrepancy between the Sanguozhi account and the Wu Shu and Kuaiji Dianlu accounts about the appointment held by Yu Fan around 200 when Sun Ce died. The Sanguozhi mentioned that Yu Fan was the Chief of Fuchun County, but the Wu Shu and Kuaiji Dianlu suggested that Yu Fan was still serving as an Officer of Merit in Kuaiji Commandery at the time.(臣松之案：此二書所說策亡之時，翻猶為功曹，與本傳不同。) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Service under Sun Quan Yu Fan was later nominated as a maocai (茂才; an outstanding civil servant). The Han central government in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) offered him a position to be an Imperial Clerk (侍御史) but he declined the offer. The warlord Cao Cao, who then held the nominal appointment of Minister of Works (司空) even though he controlled the central government, also wanted to recruit Yu Fan to serve in his office.(後翻州舉茂才，漢召為侍御史，曹公為司空辟，皆不就。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. When Yu Fan heard about it, he rejected Cao Cao's offer and remarked, \\"The robber Zhi wishes to use his excess wealth to corrupt good people.\\"(吳書曰：翻聞曹公辟，曰：「盜跖欲以餘財污良家邪？」遂拒不受。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Yu Fan made annotations to the I Ching and sent his writings to Kong Rong, the Minister Steward (少府) in the Han central government. Kong Rong praised Yu Fan's writings and remarked that they made him realise that there was \\"more about the beauty of the southeast than just the bamboo arrows of Kuaiji\\". Zhang Hong, another official serving in Kuaiji Commandery, also wrote mentioned Yu Fan in a letter to Kong Rong: \\"Scholars used to scorn Yu Zhongxiang. A beautiful piece of jade may look simple on the outside, but it sparkles after it is polished. The ridicule he faced then had no negative effect on him.\\"(翻與少府孔融書，并示以所著易注。融荅書曰：「聞延陵之理樂，覩吾子之治易，乃知東南之美者，非徒會稽之竹箭也。又觀象雲物，察應寒溫，原其禍福，與神合契，可謂探賾窮通者也。」會稽東部都尉張紘又與融書曰：「虞仲翔前頗為論者所侵，美寶為質，彫摩益光，不足以損。」) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Sun Quan appointed Yu Fan as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉). Yu Fan was known for being very candid and direct in giving advice to Sun Quan, but, in doing so, he offended his lord on many occasions and made him unhappy. Besides, he was known for exhibiting socially deviant behaviour, hence he did not get along well with others and was slandered by them. Sun Quan confined him in Jing County (涇縣), Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; in present-day Chun'an County, Zhejiang).(孫權以為騎都尉。翻數犯顏諫爭，權不能恱，又性不協俗，多見謗毀，坐徙丹楊涇縣。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Role in the conquest of Jing Province In 219,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 68. Sun Quan's general Lü Meng planned to attack Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province, which were guarded by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu. He claimed that he was ill and returned to Jianye (建業; present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) to put Guan Yu off guard. He also managed to persuade Sun Quan to release Yu Fan from confinement and let Yu Fan accompany him, because Yu Fan had medical skills and could help to treat his illness.(呂蒙圖取關羽，稱疾還建業，以翻兼知醫術，請以自隨，亦欲因此令翻得釋也。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Later that year, during the invasion of Jing Province, after Lü Meng received the surrender of Mi Fang, the Administrator of Nan Commandery (南郡; around present- day Jiangling County, Hubei), he did not immediately order his forces to occupy the city and instead held celebrations on the beach. Yu Fan reminded Lü Meng, \\"As of now, only General Mi has surrendered to us. We cannot trust that everyone in the city is willing to surrender too. Why are you celebrating here instead of quickly taking control of the city?\\" Lü Meng followed Yu Fan's advice. There was actually a planned ambush in the city but it was not successfully carried out because Lü Meng heeded Yu Fan's warning in time.(後蒙舉軍西上，南郡太守麋芳開城出降。蒙未據郡城而作樂沙上，翻謂蒙曰：「今區區一心者麋將軍也，城中之人豈可盡信，何不急入城持其管籥乎？」蒙即從之。時城中有伏計，賴翻謀不行。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. After Guan Yu was defeated, Sun Quan ordered Yu Fan to use divination to predict the final outcome, and Yu Fan concluded, \\"He'll lose his head within two days.\\" Yu Fan's prediction came true. Sun Quan remarked, \\"You may not be as good as Fuxi, but you're comparable to Dongfang Shuo.\\"(關羽旣敗，權使翻筮之，得兌下坎上，節，五爻變之臨，翻曰：「不出二日，必當斷頭。」果如翻言。權曰：「卿不及伏羲，可與東方朔為比矣。」) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Mocking Yu Jin Cao Cao's general Yu Jin was captured by Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng and was held captive in Nan Commandery. After Sun Quan seized control of Nan Commandery, he released Yu Jin and treated him with respect. One day, when Sun Quan travelling on horseback, he asked Yu Jin to ride beside him. Yu Fan saw that and shouted at Yu Jin, \\"You're a surrendered prisoner-of-war. How dare you ride side-by-side with my lord!\\" He wanted to hit Yu Jin with his horsewhip but Sun Quan ordered him to stop. Later, when Yu Jin joined Sun Quan in a feast with his subjects on board a ship, he shed tears when he heard music being played. Yu Fan mocked him, \\"Are you pretending to be pitiful?\\" Sun Quan was very unhappy with Yu Fan.(魏將于禁為羽所獲，繫在城中，權至釋之，請與相見。他日，權乘馬出，引禁併行，翻呵禁曰：「爾降虜，何敢與吾君齊馬首乎！」欲抗鞭擊禁，權呵止之。後權于樓船會羣臣飲，禁聞樂流涕，翻又曰：「汝欲以偽求免邪？」權悵然不平。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In 220, after Cao Cao died, his son Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favour, thereby ending the Han dynasty. Cao Pi then established the state of Cao Wei.Zizhi Tongjian vol. 69. Sun Quan made peace with Cao Pi and planned to send Yu Jin back to Wei, but Yu Fan objected and urged him to execute Yu Jin. Sun Quan did not listen to Yu Fan. On the day of Yu Jin's departure, Sun Quan's subjects, including Yu Fan, came to see him off. Yu Fan told Yu Jin, \\"Don't you ever think there are no great men in Wu. It is just that my advice wasn't heeded.\\" Despite being humiliated by Yu Fan during his stay in Wu, Yu Jin spoke highly of Yu Fan when he returned to Wei. Cao Pi even prepared a seat for Yu Fan(吳書曰：後權與魏和，欲遣禁還歸北，翻復諫曰：「禁敗數萬衆，身為降虜，又不能死。北習軍政，得禁必不如所規。還之雖無所損，猶為放盜，不如斬以令三軍，示為人臣有二心者。」權不聽。羣臣送禁，翻謂禁曰：「卿勿謂吳無人，吾謀適不用耳。」禁雖為翻所惡，然猶盛歎翻，魏文帝常為翻設虛坐。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. even though he knew that it would probably remain permanently unoccupied. Showing disrespect to Sun Quan In 220, Cao Pi made Sun Quan a vassal king under the title \\"King of Wu\\" (吳王) after Sun Quan pledged allegiance to him. Sun Quan threw a feast to celebrate with his subjects. During the feast, he moved around and personally poured wine for his subjects. When he came to Yu Fan, he saw that Yu Fan was lying on the ground and appeared to be drunk, so he walked away. Yu Fan immediately sat up as soon as Sun Quan walked away. Sun Quan thought that Yu Fan was deliberately snubbing him, so he turned furious, drew his sword and wanted to kill Yu Fan. His subjects were all shocked and fearful. Only Liu Ji stood up, grabbed Sun Quan, and pleaded with him to spare Yu Fan. Liu Ji said, \\"If Your Majesty kills a good man when you're drunk, even if Yu Fan is in the wrong, who would understand the truth? Your Majesty is famous and respected because you showed acceptance and tolerance towards virtuous and talented people over the years. Is it worth ruining your good reputation in just one day?\\" Sun Quan said, \\"If Cao Mengde can kill Kong Wenju, why can't I do the same to Yu Fan?\\" Liu Ji replied, \\"Mengde killed virtuous people recklessly, hence he didn't win over people's hearts. Your Majesty promotes moral values and righteousness, and wishes to be compared to Yao and Shun. Why are you comparing yourself to him?\\" Sun Quan then spared Yu Fan and instructed his men to ignore his orders in the future if he was not sober when he ordered someone to be executed.(權旣為吳王，歡宴之末，自起行酒，翻伏地陽醉，不持。權去，翻起坐。權於是大怒，手劒欲擊之，侍坐者莫不惶遽，惟大司農劉基起抱權諫曰：「大王以三爵之後，手殺善士，雖翻有罪，天下孰知之？且大王以能容賢畜衆，故海內望風，今一朝棄之，可乎？」權曰：「曹孟德尚殺孔文舉，孤於虞翻何有哉？」基曰：「孟德輕害士人，天下非之。大王躬行德義，欲與堯、舜比隆，何得自喻於彼乎？」翻由是得免。權因勑左右，自今酒後言殺，皆不得殺。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Insulting Mi Fang Yu Fan once sailed along the river and encountered Mi Fang. The sailors on Mi Fang's boat wanted Yu Fan's boat to give way, so they shouted, \\"Make way for the General's boat!\\" Yu Fan replied angrily, \\"How can you serve a lord when you've already abandoned the values of loyalty and righteousness? Are you still fit to be called a 'General' after you've lost two of your previous lord's strongholds?\\" Mi Fang did not reply and he drew the curtains on his boat and instructed his men to give way.(翻甞乘船行，與麋芳相逢，芳船上人多欲令翻自避，先驅曰：「避將軍船！」翻厲聲曰：「失忠與信，何以事君？傾人二城，而稱將軍，可乎？」芳闔戶不應而遽避之。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In another incident, Yu Fan was riding in a carriage when he passed by Mi Fang's garrison along the way. Mi Fang's men closed the gates so Yu Fan was unable to pass through. Yu Fan was furious and he shouted, \\"You leave the gates open when they are supposed to be closed, and you close them when they are supposed to be opened. Is this what you should be doing?\\" Mi Fang felt ashamed when he heard Yu Fan's remark.(後翻乘車行，又經芳營門，吏閉門，車不得過。翻復怒曰：「當閉反開，當開反閉，豈得事宜邪？」芳聞之，有慙色。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Exile to Jiao Province and death Yu Fan was known to be very direct in his speech and there were many instances when he offended people while he was drunk. Once, when Sun Quan and Zhang Zhao were talking about immortals, Yu Fan pointed at Zhang Zhao and shouted, \\"They are all dead people, yet you call them immortals. How can there be immortals in this world?\\" At this point, Sun Quan could no longer tolerate Yu Fan so he exiled him to Jiao Province. While he was in exile, Yu Fan held lectures and had hundreds of students.(翻性疏直，數有酒失。權與張昭論及神仙，翻指昭曰：「彼皆死人，而語神仙，世豈有仙人也！」權積怒非一，遂徙翻交州。雖處罪放，而講學不倦，門徒常數百人。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. He also annotated ancient classics such as the Daodejing, Lunyu and Guoyu.(又為老子、論語、國語訓注，皆傳於世。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. He was friendly with Ding Lan (丁覽) and Xu Ling (徐陵). Both of them started their careers as low- ranking officers serving in county offices, but their lives changed after they met Yu Fan because they rose through the ranks and became famous later on.(初，山陰丁覽，太末徐陵，或在縣吏之中，或衆所未識，翻一見之，便與友善，終成顯名。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. The Yu Fan Biezhuan recorded that in 229,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 71. after Sun Quan proclaimed himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu, Yu Fan wrote a memorial to congratulate him. He also expressed remorse for his past mistakes and hinted that he hoped that Sun Quan would allow him to return to Jianye (建業; in present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu).(翻別傳曰：權即尊號，翻因上書曰：「陛下膺明聖之德，體舜、禹之孝，歷運當期，順天濟物。奉承策命，臣獨抃舞。罪棄兩絕，拜賀無階，仰瞻宸極，且喜且悲。臣伏自刻省，命輕雀鼠，性輶毫釐，罪惡莫大，不容於誅，昊天罔極，全宥九載，退當念戮，頻受生活，復偷視息。臣年耳順，思咎憂憤，形容枯悴，髮白齒落，雖未能死，自悼終沒，不見宮闕百官之富，不覩皇輿金軒之飾，仰觀巍巍衆民之謠，傍聽鍾鼓侃然之樂，永隕海隅，棄骸絕域，不勝悲慕，逸豫大慶，恱以忘罪。」) Yu Fan Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Yu Fan spent more than a decade living in exile. He died at the age of 70 (by East Asian age reckoning).(在南十餘年，年七十卒。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Sun Quan permitted Yu Fan's family to bring his remains back to Yuyao County for burial. He also freed them from exile.(歸葬舊墓，妻子得還。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. When Yu Fan was living in exile, he was still very concerned about state affairs. For example, he strongly opposed Sun Quan's idea of sending an army across the sea to attack the warlord Gongsun Yuan in Liaodong (in northeastern China). However, he did not dare to voice his opinion directly to Sun Quan, so he asked Lü Dai to help him pass his message to Sun Quan, but Lü Dai did not do so. Sun Quan heard about it later and was so angry with Yu Fan for opposing his decision that he banished Yu Fan further south to Mengling County (猛陵縣), Cangwu Commandery (蒼梧郡), which is located in present-day Guangxi.(吳書曰：翻雖在徙棄，心不忘國，常憂五谿宜討，以遼東海絕，聽人使來屬，尚不足取，今去人財以求馬，旣非國利，又恐無獲。欲諫不敢，作表以示呂岱，岱不報，為愛憎所白，復徙蒼梧猛陵。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57. Sun Quan sent a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, but he regretted his decision later when storms caused the fleet to sustain heavy damage and losses. He remembered Yu Fan and quickly sent messengers to Jiao Province to fetch Yu Fan back to Jianye, but Yu Fan was already dead by then.(江表傳曰：後權遣將士至遼東，於海中遭風，多所沒失，權悔之，乃令曰：「昔趙簡子稱諸君之唯唯，不如周舍之諤諤。虞翻亮直，善於盡言，國之周舍也。前使翻在此，此役不成。」促下問交州，翻若尚存者，給其人船，發遣還都；若以亡者，送喪還本郡，使兒子仕宦。會翻已終。) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 57.

Appraisal Chen Shou, who wrote Yu Fan's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, noted that Yu Fan was very candid and direct in his speech. He also commented that Sun Quan's lack of tolerance for Yu Fan was a sign that Sun Quan was not as magnanimous as he seemed.(評曰：虞翻古之狂直，固難免乎末世，然權不能容，非曠宇也。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Yu Fan appeared as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. In chapter 43, Yu Fan was one of the Wu scholars who debated with Zhuge Liang over Sun Quan's decision to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao.(座上忽一人抗聲問曰：「今曹公兵屯百萬，將列千員，龍驤虎視，平吞江夏，公以為何如？」孔明視之，乃虞翻也。 ... 虞翻不能對。) Sanguo Yanyi ch. 43.

The neighborhood lies in the Oakland foothills, bordering Dimond Park on the eastern side of the district, and Park Boulevard on the northwestern side. The upper portion of the neighborhood sits on the west side of Park Boulevard and is bordered by the Trestle Glen neighborhood as well as the City of Piedmont. Park Boulevard, as the neighborhood spine, also serves as the local shopping node, with a number of convenience shops and several restaurants stretching a few blocks. To the south, the neighborhood is delimited by MacArthur Blvd and the I-580 freeway. The compact street grid along with a good number of amenities in the vicinity (a park, grocery stores, a library, and a number of restaurants) makes the neighborhood highly walkable, with the site walkscore.com rating it \\"Very Walkable: Most errands can be accomplished on foot.\\". Per VisitOakland, \\"Glenview feels more like a very quiet Rockridge with a couple of good restaurants and well-manicured gardens.. For trips further afield, AC Transit offers local and transbay bus service mainly from Park Boulevard and MacArthur Boulevard. The neighborhood school, Glenview Elementary School, built 1927, was found to be seismically inferior by the State Architect and was demolished in 2017, except for the historic art deco facade. It is currently being rebuilt and is expected to open following the 2019 winter break. Since the academic year 2016/2017, the school has been operating in the Santa Fe neighborhood, at the Santa Fe campus. Demographics Per the 2010 Census, there were 2,576 households in the neighborhood. Of these, 1,074 rented their unit, and 1,502 owned it. The neighborhood overall contained 5,599 residents of which 3,106 were female and 2,493 male. Relative to Oakland as a whole, there were fewer teenagers and young adults, while members of the baby boomer generation born from the mid-1940s and 20 years hence were heavily represented (as of 2010). With a size of , Glenview has a population density of 8,500 persons per square mile, slightly higher than the citywide average of 7,500. Glenview neighborhood, age distribution Glenview neighborhood, race and ethnic breakdown The neighborhood is more affluent than Oakland as a whole, with a median household income of $84,375 (versus $57,778 for Oakland) per 2016 data. Yet, an until recently relatively affordable neighborhood with many good family starter homes and ease of commuting to San Francisco, the neighborhood, along with large swaths of the East Bay, has seen its prices increase rapidly, to the point where Redfin, the real estate broker site, featured the area on a national list of \\"10 Hottest Neighborhoods to Close out the Year [2017].\\" History The neighborhood was subdivided around 1910 by the developer Wickham Havens Inc (in which Walter Leimert, builder of Leimert Bridge was an executive), and initially referred to as Fourth Avenue Terrace (east of Park Blvd) and Fourth Avenue Terrace Extension (west of Park Blvd). In the early subdivision maps, which doubled as marketing materials, the company attempted to entice would- be-owners with the prospects of good access to the city (\\"residence sites so close to the heart of Oakland that they should be classed as City, NOT suburban--It is but fifteen minutes from the center of Oakland by car line\\"). Not only could buyers get to the city via Park Blvd lines, but the early maps shows a second wider right-of-way for Key System streetcar route extension running between Wellington St and Hampel St. While this must have been part of the attraction for early buyers, this extension was never realized. The district was largely built out by the mid 1930s. Seven out of 10 units in existence today were built before 1939. By the mid-1930s, in a report on creditworthiness of the neighborhood written for the Federal Government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation program which would later earn notoriety for fostering the practice known as red-lining or denying home loans to African American neighborhoods, local officials described the neighborhood approvingly as a \\"[h]omogeneous district of semi-modern and modern homes and cottages. Convenient to local transportation, excellent schools, and shopping district, in demand by better class people of moderate income.\\" See also *Dimond District, Oakland, California External links *Neighborhood Association *Glenview Wiki References Category:Neighborhoods in Oakland, California Category:Streetcar suburbs ","title":"Glenview, Oakland, California"},{"id":"4487270","text":"Redwood Heights is a mostly middle-class and highly diverse residential neighborhood in the hills of Oakland, California. It is centered on Redwood Road, which was once a logging road. Currently, Redwood Road is the designation for 35th Avenue starting about a mile north of MacArthur Boulevard between Victor Avenue and the Warren Freeway (State Route 13). It includes Redwood Heights Elementary School Of the 2 Redwood trees on the school premises. One was planted in 1963 in remembrance of John F Kennedy. And a recreation center that doubles as an after-school daycare. It lies at an elevation of 476 feet (145 m). The homes in Redwood Heights date mainly from the 1920s-1950s and vary greatly in style, from craftsman, to \\"storybook,\\" to ranch; the first development in the area was Avenue Terrace. There is a large rock/stone \\"obelisk\\" on the corner of 35th Ave and Victor that says \\"Avenue Terrace\\" and may have once been a marker for the development. There is also an Avenue Terrace park, which is located elsewhere in the neighborhood. Redwood Heights has the important distinction of being one of Oakland's most ethnically diverse neighborhoods with a mostly middle class population. The 2010 Census reflects the primary zip code for the neighborhood as having about 23,200 residents, with caucasians making up about 29.9% of the population, African Americans 26.2%, Asians 22%, and Latinos 16.1%, with other races forming the remaining 5.8%. The Redwood Heights Neighborhood Association (est. 1944) is one of Oakland's oldest neighborhood associations.  RedwoodHeights.org History  The neighborhood known today as Redwood Heights began as a subdivision in the 1920s called Avenue Terrace (the official name of Jordan Park). Oakland's growing downtown middle class was seeking new accommodations, and a 1925 advertisement called the new neighborhood \\"the Piedmont of East Oakland.\\" The Oakland Tribune of the day extolled its \\"beautifully wooded hillsides...the pleasure in hiking and riding horseback...excellent climate...and...marine view.\\" A house and the land it stood on sold for about $5,000, and 2 grocery stores, hair salon, drug store, liquor store and shoe repair served customers at Monterey and Redwood. However, sales literature of the time euphemistically suggested that no one but European-Americans need apply. Not until the powerful civil rights movement of the 1960s did the neighborhood literally open its doors to multiple cultures. Developers carved out more plots in the 1930s: first the Sunset Manor subdivision on upper 35th and Victor; then Redwood Gardens at Redwood and Detroit. Before 1820, the native peoples who lived here were probably the Jalquin-Irgen people. A bench in Leona Canyon behind Merritt College acknowledges them and their descendants. These California Native Americans saw themselves inextricably bound to the living world, and were free of such concepts as \\"land ownership\\" and \\"natural resources.\\" What's more, they would have seen a person isolated from community as having as much meaning as a \\"finger severed from a hand.\\" The first non-native culture to touch this world were the Spanish-Californios whose vast land grant, Peralta, is the name of the creek that meanders under and through the streets on the west side of Redwood Road. When the US took California from the Mexicans in the Mexican–American War in 1848, the Peralta family fought in court to keep their lands, represented by a Yankee lawyer who promised to help them. Meanwhile, more than one hundred men in nine lumber mills logged the giant redwoods above what is now Skyline Boulevard. The majestic redwoods reached so high that they could be seen shipside from the bay. Working by hand, it took two men perched on a board wedged in a notch in the trunk, a whole day of hacking away at one giant to send it crashing to the forest floor. One felled ancient—it had been growing for over a thousand years—measured 33.5 feet in diameter. The loggers then stripped the redwood, prized for its resistance to rot and insects, of its branches, and split it into boards by drilling holes and stuffing them with dynamite. Teams of oxen lugged the lumber down the roads—including a Redwood Road so narrow, that many years later, every Sunday, according to one reminiscence, at least one Model T belonging to a picnicker would spin its wheels off the edge. By 1860, the forest was stripped. In the 1880s, for a few heart-stopping days, Oakland thought it had the beginning of its own gold rush in what is now the Lincoln Square Shopping Center. But the finding proved to be pyrite, or fool's gold. More valuable to the community, however, was the vision of a writer-poet born Cincinnatus Miller, who renamed himself Joaquin—after Joaquin Murieta, the \\"Mexican Robin Hood,\\" hero to the Californios and the most famous outlaw of the Gold Rush. Joaquin Miller, who affected a John Muir-like beard and boots, not only single-handedly planted on the clear-cut hills 70,000 trees—many of them the unfortunately flammable eucalyptus—but willed to the public trust after his death his vast land holdings, preserving for the generations the open space five minutes from our homes. The park, threaded by walking trails that were probably first cut by loggers and horse ranchers, is a combination of Joaquin Miller's visionary industry, and the second growth of the redwood forest, now in about its sixteenth decade, and said to be the oldest second growth redwood forest in the West. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the refugees came streaming to our side of the bay—filling the Fruitvale District, and venturing up the hill. There were now streetcar lines and more neighbors; on the site of today's Redwood Heights Elementary School, a Mr. DuBois owned a nursery where he grew cut flowers to sell to local florists. Post the 1989 earthquake, the school was rebuilt to meet stringent safety standards. In the 1930s, some neighborhood residents privately paid to install streets and sidewalks in front of their homes—each homeowner paying about $1,900 over ten years' time. Several neighbors founded the Redwood Heights Improvement Association in 1944. \\"Improvement\\" was a veiled reference to segregation—the name was changed to the Redwood Heights Neighborhood Association in the 1980s when neighbors changed its purpose to supporting the elementary school and encouraging the socializing that makes for a pleasant and safe way of life. Developers completed the Lincoln Square Shopping Center for about $500,000 in the early 1960s, and the new Holy Names College. Herb and Ethel Sandal managed the Improvement Association almost single-handedly in the 1970s. They presided over the widening and straightening of Redwood Road—a project meant to deal with the traffic generated by the new housing development in the Crestmont Neighborhood on the west side of Redwood above Highway 13. The Sandals had themselves come-of-age in an era of open racism (the law against inter-racial marriage was not rescinded in California until 1949). They sweated through the taking of homes on the west side of Redwood Road through eminent domain, and fought the proposals for putting in their place apartment houses and multi- unit low-income housing—in favor of the small, neatly kept single-family homes which ironically, for people who believed that \\"improvement\\" meant low-ethnic- diversity, immediately welcomed a host of new immigrant families whose contributions have helped make Redwood Heights the culturally intriguing place it is today. Post World War II, from about 1947 to 1964, Americans everywhere turned their tax monies to building highways—including Hwy 13, commissioned in 1947, and named for US Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren; and Hwy 580, completed in the 1960s, and named for General Douglas MacArthur. The removal in the 1950s of Oakland's streetcar lines (known as the Key System), the resulting dominance of car culture, the swiftness of transportation, and the increased density of housing stock have all dramatically changed the ecology and sociology of Redwood Heights.

Life Hu Ji was from Yiyang County (), Yiyang Commandery (), which is located east of present-day Tongbai County, Henan. Little is known about his early life; the first mention of him in historical records was when he was already serving in the Shu Han state during the Three Kingdoms period as a Registrar () under Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu. In 231, the Shu general Li Yan, who was in charge of logistics during the military campaigns against Shu's rival state Cao Wei, failed to ensure that supplies were transported to the frontline in time. He then attempted to fraudulently cover up his failure, but Zhuge Liang discovered the truth. Hu Ji, then holding the position of acting Army Adviser () and General of the Household of Illustrious Martial Might (), joined Zhuge Liang in petitioning the Shu emperor Liu Shan to strip Li Yan of his appointments and titles. Following Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Liu Shan appointed Hu Ji as zhongdianjun () and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Chengyang Village (). When the Shu general Wang Ping died in 248, the Shu imperial court appointed Hu Ji as the Area Commander of Hanzhong to replace Wang Ping, in addition to granting him imperial authority and appointing him as the nominal Inspector () of Yan Province. Some years later, he was promoted to Senior General Who Guards the West (). In 256, when the Shu general Jiang Wei led Shu forces on a military campaign against Wei, he made arrangements with Hu Ji, who was leading another detachment, to rendezvous with him in Shanggui County (上邽縣; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu). However, Hu Ji did not show up, and Jiang Wei ended up being defeated by Wei forces under Deng Ai's command. Hu Ji was later promoted to Right General of Agile Cavalry (). In 258, Jiang Wei deployed Hu Ji, Wang Han () and Jiang Bin () in Hanshou County (漢壽縣; northeast of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), Yuecheng County (樂城縣; present-day Chenggu County, Shaanxi) and Hancheng County (漢城縣; present-day Mian County, Shaanxi) to guard against invasions from Wei. Hu Ji died in an unknown year. He was known for being loyal, upright and honest. Zhuge Liang once mentioned that Hu Ji, Cui Zhouping (), Xu Shu and Dong He () were the only ones among his friends who could criticise him and point out his shortcomings and failures.

History  After his brother died in 195, Huchuquan attempted to regain his position as Chanyu of the Southern Xiongnu but was driven back by the same people who had ousted his brother. He came to serve under Yuan Shang in 202 and was defeated by Cao Cao's officer Zhong Yao, after which he surrendered. Huchuquan was kept as an honored prisoner at Ye and attended Cao Pi's accession ceremony in 220. No new chanyu was proclaimed after Huchuquan's death. The last vestiges of the Xiongnu were split into five divisions and settled in Taiyuan Commandery under the supervision of Yufuluo's son Liu Bao and niece Liu Qubei. The Xiongnu went on to found three of the short lived Sixteen Kingdoms: Former Zhao (304–329), Northern Liang (397–439), and Xia (407–431).

He was a friend of Pope Gregory I, and aroused the enmity of the Emperor Justinian by opposing certain imperial doctrines about the Body of Christ (Justinian favoured the Aphthartodocetae). He was to be deposed from his See and exiled when Justinian died; but Justin II carried out his uncle's purpose five years later in 570, and another bishop, Gregory of Antioch, was put in his place. But when Gregory died in 593, Anastasius was restored to his See. This was chiefly due to Pope Gregory the Great, who interceded with the Emperor Maurice and his son Theodosius, asking that Anastasius be sent to Rome, if not reinstated at Antioch. From some letters sent to him by Gregory, it is thought that he was not sufficiently vigorous in denouncing the claims of the Patriarch of Constantinople to be a universal bishop. There is some confusion about the date of his death. According to some sources, he was killed by a Jewish mob in 599. His feast day is 21 April. An alternative version is that Anastasius died in 598, and was succeeded by another bishop by the same name, to whom the translation of Gregory's Regula Pastoralis is attributed, and who is recorded as having been put to death in an insurrection of the Jews. However, Nicephorus (Hist. Eccl., XVIII, xliv) declares that these two are one and the same person. The same difficulty occurs with regard to certain Sermones de orthodoxa fide, some ascribing them to the latter Anastasius; others claiming that there was but one bishop of that name.

Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68–69, A53. Plot Lord Emsworth's world is far from ideal – not only has his neighbour Sir Gregory Parsloe- Parsloe stolen his pigman Wellbeloved, but his niece Gertrude is imprisoned in the house, mooning miserably about the place and, worse still, trying to be \\"helpful\\" by tidying his study. Meanwhile, Freddie Threepwood, back in England to promote his father-in-law Mr Donaldson's \\"Dog-Joy\\" biscuits, has just been turned down by his dog-loving Aunt Georgiana, Gertrude's mother, when he runs into his old Oxford pal Beefy Bingham. Bingham, Freddie learns, is in love with cousin Gertrude, but as he is not well-off, the family have closed ranks and sent Gertrude away to Blandings. Inspired by a Super-film he has seen, Freddie sends Bingham down to the castle, under the guise of a Mr \\"Popjoy\\" (based on Lord Emsworth's mishearing of the dog biscuits Freddie is selling), tasked with ingratiating himself with the Earl. Emsworth is at first pleased to see Gertrude less dour, and charmed by his guest's diffidence and helpful ways, but soon finds himself smothered – Bingham is overdoing the ingratiating. Emsworth even begins to question the man's sanity, when he wakes in the night to find the fellow blowing kisses up at his window. When Bingham tries to help Emsworth off a ladder and knocks him to the ground, he hopes to remedy the others ills (and anger) with a bottle of balm; sadly however, he buys a product designed for horses, which causes his Lordship considerable pain. When he sees Emsworth singing during his morning swim, he mistakes the awful noise for cries for help, and dashes in to save the aging peer, only to be thanked with a stiff punch in the face. Freddie reveals to Emsworth that Popjoy is in fact Bingham, hopeful of one of the many livings in Emsworth's gift. When Emsworth realises that he can inflict the man on his enemy Parsloe- Parsloe, he doesn't hesitate from granting him the job.

Latham was commissioned by the United Kingdom government and industry organisations to review procurement and contractual arrangements in the UK construction industry, aiming to tackle controversial issues facing the industry during a period of lapse in growth as a whole. Historical context The Latham Report was not the first report to identify systemic failings in the UK construction industry; previous reports dating back to the 1960s had identified similar issues and made similar recommendations.Ward, Don and Crane, Alan (2003) \\"The story so far\\" in Jones, David, Savage, David and Westgate Rona, Partnering and Collaborative Working (Informa Professional, London), pp. 1-26. However, this report did gain industry and government support. The report Latham identified industry inefficiencies, condemning existing industry practices as 'adversarial', 'ineffective', 'fragmented', 'incapable of delivering for its clients' and 'lacking respect for its employees'. He urged reform and advocated partnering and collaboration by construction companies. A key concept was that through teamwork the construction industry could delight its customers. Latham made 53 recommendations to change industry practices, to increase efficiency and to replace the bureaucratic, wasteful, adversarial atmosphere prevalent in most construction projects with one characterised by openness, co-operation, trust, honesty, commitment and mutual understanding among team members. For example: :\\"Partnering includes the concepts of teamwork between supplier and client, and of total continuous improvement. It requires openness between the parties, ready acceptance of new ideas, trust and perceived mutual benefit…. We are confident that partnering can bring significant benefits by improving quality and timeliness of completion whilst reducing costs.\\" (para 6.45, p. 62)Latham, M. (1994), Constructing the Team, London: HMSO. :\\"Partnering arrangements are also beneficial between firms…. Such arrangements should have the principal objective of improving performance and reducing costs for clients. They should not become 'cosy'. The construction process exists to satisfy the client. Good relationships based on mutual trust benefit clients.\\" (para 6.46, p. 62) Recommendations #The government should commit itself to being a best practice client. #The private sector should get together to establish a construction clients forum. #The Construction Industry Council (CIC) should issue a guide to briefing for clients. #The DoE should publish a simply worded construction strategy code of practice. #A checklist of design responsibilities should be prepared. #The use of co-ordinated project information should be a contractual requirement. #The responsibilities for building services design should be clearly defined. #A set of basic principles is required on which modern contract should be based. #A complete family of interlocking contractual documents is required. #A target should be set for 33% of government funded projects starting over the next four years to use the New Engineering Contract. #The role and duties of project managers requires to be more clearly defined. #The DoE should develop quality registers of approved contractors, sub-contractors and consultants. #Guidance should be issued on rationalising tender list arrangements and on partnering. #The specific efforts of BS5750 in the construction process requires further investigation. #Adjudication should be the normal form of dispute resolution. Legacy The Report spawned a raft of initiatives including the establishment of the Construction Industry Board to oversee reform. At the request of the Construction Clients' Forum (formed following Latham's recommendation), the CIB published a further report, Partnering in the Team in 1996. In parallel, the industry reform group, the Reading Construction Forum, published Trusting the Team: the Best Practice Guide to Partnering in Construction in 1995 (for which Latham wrote the foreword).Bennett, J. and Jayes, S. (1995) Trusting the Team, Reading: Centre for Strategic Studies in Construction, The University of Reading, with the partnering task force of the Reading Construction Forum. Subsequent initiatives included the 1998 Egan Report Re-thinking construction, and the establishment of industry change organisations including the Design Build Foundation (1997) Construction Best Practice Programme, the IT Construction Best Practice Programme, Movement for Innovation and Constructing Excellence. The Latham and Egan Reports' focus on collaboration was also referenced by Chief Construction Adviser Paul Morrell in the UK government construction strategy in 2011.Construction Strategy, Cabinet Office - http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/government-construction- strategy (accessed 30 January 2012) Latham's call for quality registers of approved contractors, sub-contractors and consultants led to the 1998 establishment of Constructionline. The Latham Review commended the establishment of the Interdisciplinary Design for the Built Environment programme at the University of Cambridge (page 73) and in turn was one of the influences that helped to shape the early syllabus of the IDBE course.

He was educated at St George's School, Windsor Castle, at Eton College and at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. He began working as a stage designer in 1934, but he did not work on films until the early 1940s. At the outbreak of World War II he joined the navy. In 1943 he was granted a temporary release to design the costumes and armour for Laurence Olivier's film version of Shakespeare's Henry V (1944). In 1945, at the end of the war, he was reunited with Olivier at the Old Vic company in London. In 1946 he created the sets for the ballet Adam Zero at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Furse became a frequent collaborator with Olivier on both stage and screen, often on Shakespearean productions. He won two Oscars in 1949, one each for his art direction and costume design of Olivier's film version of Hamlet (1948).\\"Hamlet\\" @ Awards Databases He also worked with Olivier on his films Richard III (1955) and The Prince and the Showgirl (1957).

It was founded in 1903, and was the first school in Malta established by the Brothers of the Christian Schools (better known as the De La Salle Brothers). The College consists of a primary section, secondary school and a coeducational sixth form. History of the College De La Salle College was founded in November 1903 with permission from Sir Charles Clarke, Governor of Malta. The school was closed during the 1910s due to the lack of students but reopened several months later.About Us - Our History: The First Years The College was not spared during the Siege of Malta in 1940. Due to structural damage to school buildings the Brothers and students stayed with other Catholic communities for the duration of the war.About Us - Our History: 1939-44 In 1961 boarding was introduced and the school magazine Lasallian was first published. A sixth form was opened in 1966 as a joint venture between the College and fellow Lasallian school Stella Maris College in Gzira.De La Salle Sixth Form Due to a dispute between church and educational authorities, the College was closed for part of the 1983-84 academic year. Girls have been admitted to the sixth form since the 1970s. Achievements De La Salle College established a name for itself in the field of sports and physical education. Many former students went on to represent their country in football, handball, water-polo, athletics, tennis, squash, badminton, basketball, hockey, sailing, karate and others. In inter-college sports, De La Salle is always prominent. It is worth recording that the College built the first full-size sports hall in Malta, which became the venue for various associations to hold their national competitions. Outside playing fields to cater for various disciplines form an integral part of the school premises. De la Salle The De La Salle Monument In 1951, the 1,500 schools and colleges of the De La Salle Order spread through the five continents celebrated the Third Centenary of the birth of St. John Baptist de la Salle. The students who at De La Salle College were preparing to enter H.M. Dockyard, Malta, resolved to donate their first weekly salary towards the erection of a statue of the saint in the event of their being successful at the very competitive Dockyard Entrance Examination. The proposal met with general approval and thus it was that from 1951 to 1959, successive groups of candidates contributed the grand sum of Lm 874, 17s, 8d to a special fund. The monument stands on a circular base 24 ft in diameter in the centre of which rise a 35 ft. concrete column 8 ft wide and 3 ft.4 ins thick. The face looking towards the College Drive represents the Founder of the Brothers with on his right hand two teenage apprentices surrounded by the tools of their trade. The whole scene is made up of 100,000 pieces of mosaic of 120 colours blended together. On the opposite side of the monument, an inscription in bronze reads: “TO HONOUR ST.

Michael Gonzi. To commemorate the erection of this monument, the Former Students’ Association organises each year several religious and sport activities. De La Salle Monument The College Badge After the Second World War, the Brothers and their staff wished to adopt a uniform and a badge or coat-of-arms for their students. > Some wanted a green blazer and grey trousers, but the majority preferred a > dark blue blazer.

It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 and in 1864 a Parliamentary Committee recommended that the dockyards at Deptford (and Woolwich) should be closed. Their recommendation was accepted and the Deptford dockyard was closed in May 1869,Handbook to the Environs of London by James Thorne, John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1876 by which time it employed 800 people.

The Royal Naval Victualling Depot operated here which included a rum store. During the Second World War a bomb destroyed one of the storehouses and killed a number of men, a plaque was visible in the early 1970s commemorating this tragedy. During the war, because of the Blitz some of the stores were dispersed to various locations including Park Royal.

The Depot was the main Air Freight hub for the RN and was particularly busy during the Falklands War. It also continued as the central RN Stationery Store and Joint Services Baggage operations. The Depot closed in 1981. The site purchased by News International from the UK Ministry of Defence for £1,600,000 (), and a remainder in 1986, for £340,000 (). In 1993 the Greenwich and Lewisham (London Borough Boundaries) Order transferred the site from the London Borough of Greenwich to the London Borough of Lewisham. Archaeology Most of the Tudor, Stuart, Georgian and Victorian structures above ground level that had survived until 1955 have since been destroyed. One structure that escaped the demolition is Olympia Warehouse, a unique cast-iron building constructed in the 1840s.Convoys Wharf London , Richard Rogers Partnership, 2002 However, archaeological surveys carried out by CgMs and Pre-Construct Archaeology in 2000 by Duncan Hawkins, in 2000 by Jon Lowe and in 2001 by David Divers, established that by far the greater part of the dockyard survives as buried structures filled in intact between 1869 and 1950. The structures of the yard proper, the docks, slips, basins, mast ponds, landing places and stairs, constitute a substantial architectural fabric that is currently extant, though largely invisible, being covered by superficial accretion or infill. As yet there has been no archaeological investigation of the garden area of Sayes Court, and only limited trial trenching of part of the manor house.CVW00, Convoys Wharf evaluation by CgMs Consulting on behalf of News International PLC by David Divers International recognition In October 2013 Deptford Dockyard and Sayes Court garden were added to the World Monuments Fund's 2014 watch list. Sayes Court The War Department hired the Sayes Court area and almshouses, from the City of London Corporation from 19 September 1914 to use as a Horse Transport Reserve Depot at a rental of £90 per annum (), to enlarge its Supply Reserve Depot at the Foreign Cattle Market.Lewisham past and present, by John Coulter, Sutton Publishing, 2001 The fee simple of the Foreign Cattle Market and of the Sayes Court property were purchased by the War Department, for £400,500 (), under deeds dated 25 March 1926, 18 March 1927 and 25 July 1927 including the railway, tramway, wharfage and jetty rights and easements. Dockyard railways From 15 December 1900 there was tramway access via Grove Street, to the Foreign Cattle Market, using their own Maudslay petrol locomotive. When the docks became an army depot the junction was relaid to standard gauge for direct connection to the LB&SCR.;London Bridge to East Croydon byVic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Middleton Press There was as well, an internal narrow-gauge tramway system. When the War Department took over, they introduced steam locomotives to work the tramways,The gauge is listed at as also having been used at Woolwich Arsenal, Chatham Dockyard, Crewe Locomotive Works and Horwich Locomotive Works purchasing between 1915 and 1917, twelve oil-fired Warril type gauge locomotives from the Hunslet Engine Company.18 Inch Gauge Steam Railways by Mark Smithers In December 1920 the Government announced the sale of the equipment from the railway at the Deptford Meat Depot. In 1921 Sir Robert Walker purchased three locos and 75 wagons for the Sand Hutton Light Railway, and purchased a fourth 1927. By January 1938 of the remaining eight locos, seven were apparently still in existence at Deptford, but out of use.

Convoys WharfIn 2002 News International applied to the London Borough of Lewisham for outline planning permission to erect 3,500 residential units on the site. Lewisham councillors resolved to approve the application in May 2005. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse would have to be preserved and refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site. New International engaged Richard Rogers to develop a masterplan for the site.Planning Context The Thames Path interrupted by Convoys WharfIf the Mayor allowed the application it would then be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Reasons for such a referral would include a Government direction that half the site is safeguarded for freight use. Since freight wharves on the Thames were safeguarded in 1997 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, John Gummer, only one operational wharf has been lost to residential use without a full public inquiry. This was Delta/Blackwall Wharf, a major aggregates wharf redeveloped as part of the Greenwich Peninsula masterplan. On 18 May 2005 a 50/50 joint venture company of Cheung Kong Holdings and Hutchison Whampoa entered into an agreement to acquire Convoys Wharf, to develop it as a mixed residential and commercial project, with News International retaining a profit share in the sale of the luxury homes proposed.http://notice.singtao.com/ADMA/00013/epdf/2140405-CKH-PA(e)5555.pdf In 2008 a new planning application was submitted by Hutchison based largely on the original Richard Rogers scheme. In July 2011 Hutchison Whampoa engaged Aedas to develop a new masterplan for the site and submitted an amendment planning application. Then in early 2012 Hutchison appointed Terry Farrell to revise the masterplan for the site and submitted a planning application in April 2013. In September 2011 a group of local residents launched a campaign, with the name Deptford Is.. to oppose the masterplan proposed by the developers. They have proposed a couple of projects to connect to the history of the area and benefit the local community. These are the Lenox project (see below) and Sayes Court Garden.Our campaign so far at Deptford Is ... On 17 October 2013, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London called in the application.\\"Convoys Wharf\\", Greater London Authority In January 2014 Lewisham Council's strategic planning committee recommended that the outline planning application for Convoys Wharf in its current form be rejected.Council recommends rejection of Convoys Wharf application On 22 January 2014 Dame Joan Ruddock challenged the government to recognise the unique heritage features of the site.Convoys Wharf, Deptford, Daily Hansard - Debate, 22 January 2014 : Column 408 On 31 March 2014 Boris Johnson approved plans to build up to 3,500 new homes on the Convoys Wharf site that has been derelict since 2000. A planning application to build a first major residential block of 456 flats, the first of 22 plots in Hutchison's masterplan, was approved by Lewisham Council in June 2020. Future plans include a 1.5 acre park on an existing river pontoon, cultural, commercial and retail space, and 3,500 homes including three towers up to 40 storeys tall. The Lenox Project In 2013 the Lenox Project put forward a formal proposal to build a full-size sailing replica of HMS Lenox, a 70-gun ship of the line originally built at Deptford Dockyard in 1678. The ship would actually be constructed on the dockyard site, and would form the centrepiece of a purpose-built museum which would remain as a permanent part of the development of Convoys Wharf. By late 2015 the project had gathered momentum, with more detailed plans fitting the building of the Lenox into the overall development of this part of Deptford. The 2015 Feasibility Study identified the Safeguarded Wharf at the Western end of the Convoys Wharf site as the most suitable place for the dry-dock where the ship herself would be built; the existing but disused canal entrance could then be modified to provide an entrance for the dock as well as a home berth for the finished ship. It is hoped that the Lenox will provide a focus for the regeneration of the area as the comparable replica ship Hermione did for Rochefort in France.

Mars Orbiter Mission India's first mission to Mars, the Mars Orbiter Mission, or Mangalyaan, reached the planet on 24 September 2014 completing its 300-day journey. While ISRO has been researching for a Mars mission for many years, the project was only approved by the government in August 2012. ISRO took over a year to work on the spacecraft and bring the project to implementation stage. The Mars Orbiter Mission was launched on 5 November 2013 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, on the country's east coast. After travelling 670 million kilometres, Mangalyaan is now set to study the surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere to better understand the climate, geology, origin, evolution and sustainability of life on the planet. It is the most cost effective of all the missions sent to the planet by any other country costing India about $74 million. Chandrayaan I & II Chandrayaan-1, was India's first mission to the Moon launched by India's national space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The unmanned lunar exploration mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh about 80 km north of Chennai at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, and India joined a band of Asian nations (China and Japan) in exploring the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. Image of the spacecraft.

A set of constraints D entails a constraint C if every solution to D is also a solution to C. In other words, if V is a valuation of the variables in the scopes of the constraints in D and all constraints in D are satisfied by V, then V also satisfies the constraint C. Some operations on constraints produce a new constraint that is a consequence of them. Constraint composition operates on a pair of binary constraints ((x,y),R) and ((y,z),S) with a common variable. The composition of such two constraints is the constraint ((x,z),Q) that is satisfied by every evaluation of the two non-shared variables for which there exists a value of the shared variable y such that the evaluation of these three variables satisfies the two original constraints ((x,y),R) and ((y,z),S). Constraint projection restricts the effects of a constraint to some of its variables. Given a constraint (t,R) its projection to a subset t' of its variables is the constraint (t',R') that is satisfied by an evaluation if this evaluation can be extended to the other variables in such a way the original constraint (t,R) is satisfied. Extended composition is similar in principle to composition, but allows for an arbitrary number of possibly non-binary constraints; the generated constraint is on an arbitrary subset of the variables of the original constraints. Given constraints C_1,\\\\ldots,C_m and a list A of their variables, the extended composition of them is the constraint (A,R) where an evaluation of A satisfies this constraint if it can be extended to the other variables so that C_1,\\\\ldots,C_m are all satisfied.

Overview The agency was created by a decision of the Flemish government dated April 16, 2004 as part of the government reform project Beter Bestuurlijk Beleid. By a decision of the Flemish Government of March 31, 2006, the agency began operation on April 1, 2006. It is led by an Administrator-General, who is appointed by the Flemish Government for a renewable six year term. The agency is made up out of the parts, responsible for energy, of the former Division of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) of the Flemish administration. It currently has some 85 employees. The agency has its main office in Brussel and has offices in Gent and Hasselt. The agency employs a highly educated, technically trained staff, about two thirds of whom are engineers, legal and environmental protection specialists. Mission The Flemish Energy Agency has the following tasks: * The promotion and support of the use of renewable energy and green energy; * The promotion and support of energy conservation by means of: ** building standards with regards to energy; ** emission trading; ** covenants with the industry; ** energy demand management; ** reporting in the field of energy economics; * The development and execution of social energy policy; * Communication to the industry and general public with regard to these aforementioned issues. The agency works closely with other Flemish agencies and administrations, as well as with the federal and local governments to develop new decrees and regulations and to enforce existing energy regulations. To enforce the compliance to energy regulations, the agency has the power to impose administrative sanctions, for instance fines, as punishment for non-compliance.

The attacker hopes to correctly guess the sequence number to be used by the sending host. If they can do this, they will be able to send counterfeit packets to the receiving host which will seem to originate from the sending host, even though the counterfeit packets may in fact originate from some third host controlled by the attacker. One possible way for this to occur is for the attacker to listen to the conversation occurring between the trusted hosts, and then to issue packets using the same source IP address. By monitoring the traffic before an attack is mounted, the malicious host can figure out the correct sequence number. After the IP address and the correct sequence number are known, it is basically a race between the attacker and the trusted host to get the correct packet sent. One common way for the attacker to send it first is to launch another attack on the trusted host, such as a Denial-of-Service attack. Once the attacker has control over the connection, it is able to send counterfeit packets without getting a response. If an attacker can cause delivery of counterfeit packets of this sort, he or she may be able to cause various sorts of mischief, including the injection into an existing TCP connection of data of the attacker's choosing, and the premature closure of an existing TCP connection by the injection of counterfeit packets with the RST bit set. Theoretically, other information such as timing differences or information from lower protocol layers could allow the receiving host to distinguish authentic TCP packets from the sending host and counterfeit TCP packets with the correct sequence number sent by the attacker. If such other information is available to the receiving host, if the attacker can also fake that other information, and if the receiving host gathers and uses the information correctly, then the receiving host may be fairly immune to TCP sequence prediction attacks. Usually this is not the case, so the TCP sequence number is the primary means of protection of TCP traffic against these types of attack. Another solution to this type of attack is to configure any router or firewall to not allow packets to come in from an external source but with an internal IP address. Although this does not fix the attack, it will prevent the potential attacks from reaching their targets.

In February 2009, Caffari completed the Vendée Globe race and set a new record to become the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions.  Early life  Descended from a Maltese sea captain,http://www.yachtonline.it/people-en/samantha-davies-dee-caffari-eng Caffari grew up in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire and attended St. Clement Danes School. Caffari studied at Leeds Metropolitan University and became a PE teacher for 5 years before beginning her sailing career.  Sailing career  Caffari trained at UKSA (based in Cowes, Isle of Wight) completing her Yachtmaster course and a range of ocean qualifications. Caffari then worked for Formula 1 Sailing, first as a skipper and then as the manager of their fleet of Farr 65s in the UK and the Caribbean. She then took part in the ten- month Global Challenge race, which departed on 3 October 2004. Held every four years, this race takes a fleet of one design (or matching) steel yachts, crewed by amateur sailors who have paid to take part, round Cape Horn and through the Southern Ocean where winds can exceed 70 knots. That race also takes the westabout route. Caffari was the skipper of the yacht Imagine It. Done. One crewmember needed to be airlifted off in the Southern Ocean, creating the largest Southern Ocean Rescue of all time for the New Zealand Rescue Service. The race also saw the team develop from having to retire from the second leg of the race to finishing on the podium in leg six. On 20 November 2005, she set off on her attempt to single-handedly circumnavigate the world against the prevailing winds and currents. She finished on 18 May 2006, at 17:55pm, after 178 days at sea. Her voyage was sponsored by Aviva. On 2 December 2006, she was a runner up for BBC South Sports Personality of the Year. She did win the Tenon Yachtsperson of the Year award. In January 2007 Caffari announced that she would be taking part in the Vendée Globe 2008/09 singlehanded round the world yacht race, again sponsored by Aviva. In March 2007 she announced a technical partnership with Mike Golding to allow both the British entries in the Vendée Globe to work together. In September 2007, Caffari's autobiography Against the Flow was published by Adlard Coles Nautical. In December 2007 she had to be rescued by Royal Navy frigate HMS Northumberland after dismasting in severe weather off northwest Spain whilst competing singlehanded in the Transat Ecover B2B Race. In May 2008 she competed in the Artemis Transat race across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth to Boston, against the prevailing winds. In February 2009 Dee Caffari completed the Vendee Globe race and set a new record becoming the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions. In March 2009, Caffari's autobiography Against the Flow was published in paperback with an additional chapter charting the lead up to her Vendee Globe entry and subsequent world record achievement. In June 2009 Dee Caffari set a new record for circumnavigating Britain and Ireland after crossing the Solent finish line on her Open 60 Aviva having beaten the existing record by 17 hours. Caffari was a crewmember aboard all-female Team SCA for the 2014–15 Volvo Ocean Race. In 2017 she skippers the Turn the Tide on Plastic boat in the 2017–18 Volvo Ocean Race. She will be a guest skipper on Maiden's global voyage in 2018 in support of The Maiden Factor Foundation.  Role within the Community  Dee has been an enthusiastic supporter of charities such as Toe in The Water (using competitive sailing to re-inspire injured servicemen), and Sail 4 Cancer. In October 2011, Dee Caffari accepted the role as the new patron for the charity Gosport and Fareham Inshore Rescue Service which is an independent lifeboat station based in Stokes Bay local to where Dee Caffari lives. Dee Caffari sits on the Operations Board of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and is an Honorary Commander in the Royal Navy.  Bibliography  Caffari, Dee.

Natalia was married to Major-General Petr Petrovich Lanskoy from 1844 until her death in 1863.  Prior to marriage  Natalia (Natalya) Goncharova was born on 8 September 1812 (27 August 1812 Old Style) in Karian village in Tambov Governorate (in present-day Znamensky District, Tambov Oblast), where her family lived during the occupation of Moscow by the forces of Napoleon. Her father, Nikolay Afanasievich Goncharov, a scion of the family of paper manufacturers from Kaluga, was pronounced demented in 1815; the household was managed by his wife, Natalia Ivanovna Zagriajskaya, an imperious lady with connections within Muscovite nobility. Her ancestors included Petro Doroshenko, Hetman of Ukrainian Cossacks. Natalie (as she was familiarly known) met Alexander Pushkin at the age of 16, when she was one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow.  Marriage to Pushkin  Natalia Nikolayevna Goncharova, 1849. Portrait by Ivan Makarov After many hesitations, Natalia eventually accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not until she had received assurances that the tsarist government did not intend to persecute the libertarian poet. They were officially engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Because of the outbreak of cholera and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February (Old Style) or 2 March (New Style) 1831 in the Great Ascension Church on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street in Moscow. Natalia Alexandrovna Pushkina, Pushkin's daughter, 1849. Portrait by Ivan Makarov Natalia's granddaughter Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven During the six years of their marriage, Natalia Pushkina gave birth to four children: Maria (b. 1832, suggested as a prototype of Anna Karenina), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835), and Natalia (b. 1836) (who married into the royal House of Nassau- Weilburg to Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and became Countess of Merenberg). As the family lived in the country for prolonged periods, while Pushkin spent most of his time in the capitals, there was a sizeable correspondence between Natalia and Pushkin. Seventy-eight letters from Pushkin to Natalia remain; they are frequently written in a light-hearted tone with touches of ribaldry, but none of them could be called love letters. It is believed that the poet dedicated several poems to her, including \\"Madonna\\" (1830). Natalya's correspondence with Pushkin was lost except for one letter, written together with her mother Natalia Ivanovna.  Reputed affair with D'Anthès  In 1835 Natalia met a French immigrant, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès, and was involved in a society intrigue, which provoked rumours of an affair with D'Anthès. These resulted in a duel between Pushkin and D'Anthès on 27 January 1837, in which Pushkin was mortally wounded. Commentators disagree about the propriety of Natalia's behaviour in this situation. Some, including Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva, covertly or overtly blamed Pushkin's death on her, feeling that she did not understand his greatness and failed to take an appropriate interest in his art. It does seem that she preferred worldly pleasures to his company, though to some extent she was obliged to socialise separately from him; for example, even during her pregnancies, she often had to chaperone her sisters in the court, since there was no one else to do so, and only by going into society could they find husbands. Her constant demands for money for costly dresses and jewellery forced the poet to write increasingly for money rather than for pleasure. However, modern research into archival materials and contemporary memoirs, including those of family members (who always mentioned Natalia Nikolayevna with great warmth and respect), leads to a more sympathetic view. It stands to her credit that she preserved Pushkin's letters to her (which suggests that she had some idea of the significance of his written heritage), and subsequently she allowed them to be published.  Second marriage and death  Much was made of Natalia's relationship with Nicholas I after Pushkin's death; it was even rumoured that she became his mistress. In 1843, she met Petr Petrovich Lanskoy (1799-1877), who served at the same regiment as her brother. After having been blessed by the tsar, their wedding was held in Strelna on 16 July 1844. Lanskoy was in favour with the tsar, and he had had a remarkable career before his marriage. Following the marriage, Natalia gave birth to three daughters: Alexandra (b. 1845), Elizaveta (b. 1846) and Sophia (b. 1848). Natalia died on 26 November 1863 and her ashes were laid in the cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. References Further reading * Vadim Stark. Zhizn s poetom.

They inhabit marine and brackish waters in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans. They can be used in the preparation of bagoong. Ponyfishes are small and laterally compressed in shape, with a bland, silvery colouration. They are distinguished by highly extensible mouths, and the presence of a mechanism for locking the spines in the dorsal and anal fins. They also possess a highly integrated light organ in their throats that houses symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria that project light through the animal's underside. Typically, the harbored bacterium is only Photobacterium leiognathi, but in the two ponyfish species Photopectoralis panayensis and Photopectoralis bindus, Photobacterium mandapamensis is also present. Two of the most widely studied uses for luminescence in ponyfish are camouflage by ventral counterillumination and species-specific sexual dimorphism. Although ponyfish seem quite ordinary and morphologically similar, their light organ systems are highly variable across species and often between sexes.

They are bottom-dwelling cartilaginous fishes with large, rounded pectoral fin discs and long tails. They can produce an electric discharge for defense, from which their scientific name is derived (Greek narke, meaning \\"paralysis\\"). Members of this family are commonly known as the numbfishes, and are found almost worldwide in warm temperate and tropical continental and continental insular waters. They are strictly marine, so are absent from rivers and lakes. They occur in sandy beaches, muddy enclosed bays, estuaries, off coral reefs and river mouths, and on the upper continental slope to a depth of 1,071 m.Compagno, L.J.V. and Last, P.R. (1999). Narcinidae. Numbfishes. p. 1433-1437. In: K.E. Carpenter and V.H. Niem (eds.) FAO identification guide for fishery purposes. The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization. Description Small to medium-sized rays, adult numbfishes range from 15 to 66 cm long, though most are less than 50 cm. They have oval, rounded, or shovel-shaped pectoral discs and stout tails of equal or longer length. The snout is moderately elongated, rounded, or rounded-angular, differing from the narkids in being supported by broad rostral cartilages. The mouth is straight, with stout, elongated, and highly protrusible jaws and a prominent groove around its periphery. The nostrils are just forward of the mouth and connected to it by a broad groove; the nasal flaps are short, but merged into a broad nasal curtain that overlaps the mouth. The small teeth have a single moderate cusp; the teeth and tooth bands are exposed when the mouth is closed (except in Diplobatis). Two prominent dorsal fins of roughly equal size and a large caudal fin are present. Numbfishes vary in color from whitish or yellowish to brownish, grey-brown, greenish, reddish, or black above, either plain or with small to large spots, blotches, bars or lines, sometimes forming complex eye-shaped spots or ocelli on the pectoral fins. They are usually white underneath, or black in deep-water species. The large, kidney-shaped electric organs at the base of the pectoral fins are visible through the skin. Biology and ecology Numbfishes are slow-swimming bottom- dwellers that feed on small fishes and invertebrates off the bottom; their protrusible jaws aid in removing prey from the substrate. They can generate a moderate shock if disturbed and contact is made with the electric organs; the electrical discharges of narcinids have been measured at 8-37 volts, much less than the electric rays of the genus Torpedo.Martin, R.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media. It broadcasts on 1390 kHz with 5 kilowatts in the daytime and 106 watts at night from a two- tower directional antenna array adjacent to the Townsquare cluster complex on Pendell Road in the Town of Poughkeepsie. WEOK, and simulcast partner 1340 WALL in Middletown, New York, changed format to the True Oldies Channel in February 2010, after broadcasting Radio Disney since March 2005. The two stations have been simulcasting programming since September 1999 going through three prior formats. History to 1999 WEOK signed on in 1949 as a daytimer and the second station licensed to Poughkeepsie after WKIP. The station chose the WEOK calls given that their original choice, WPOK (for POughKeepsie) was unavailable and the WEOK calls sounded familiar. In the 1950s and 1960s WEOK was a full-service Middle of the Road radio station. Programming included news blocks in the morning and noon time house. Late mornings were reserved for The Hyde Park Show, The Rhinebeck Show and Pleasant Valley Shows. Radio station personalities would broadcast live from area shopping centers. In the 1960s WEOK added its Talkback show after the noon news. The mainstay telephone talk show was hosted by Raphael Mark and later by Larry Hughes. In the late 1960s, in response to Top 40 WHVW, the station would feature rock & roll tunes in Ralph Aregale's afternoon show. In 1962 it added an FM signal at 101.5 MHz (now WPDH). It simulcast WEOK during the day and had a series of block programing at night including classical, jazz, show tunes and folk music hosted by Raphael. The station began to lean toward soft rock and was more an adult contemporary station by 1970. In 1972, the Dyson family bought the WEOK stations and changes took place at both frequencies. While the FM side went on its own, the AM side began to lean towards Top 40 in what today would be considered Hot Adult Contemporary. Weekends included specialty programming including the start of the \\"Solid Gold Jukebox\\" hosted by WKIP refugee Rick McCaffrey (now of WBPM). This format lasted until 1981 when WEOK flipped to country in the wave of the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" fad. It failed in the ratings and left the format in 1983. Though WEOK returned to what it had left, it leaned more on oldies and flipped entirely to oldies in 1986. Two years later, this format was replaced when WEOK changed to pop standards as a charter affiliate of Unistar's \\"AM Only\\" format, better known today as Westwood One's \\"Popular Standards\\" while retaining local programming drive times and parts of weekends. WEOK's oldies format and some of the air staff (including Rick McCaffery) informally migrated to WCZX. In 1993 WCZX became a sister to WEOK through a local marketing agreement, then an outright purchase in 1996. History since 1999 The aging demographics of pop standards by the late 1990s led WEOK owner Crystal Radio Group (the spun off Dyson family unit) to explore changing its format. In summer 1999, the decision was made to dissolve the formats of WEOK and sister WALL in Middletown and to launch a new format on the two frequencies. On September 6, 1999, WEOK dumped pop standards and joined with WALL to simulcast the talk format. Nick Robbins program director and morning man for many years took the station through many format changes under station manager Mike Harris. The stations became known as \\"News-Talk 13,\\" an amalgam of Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura, Poughkeepsie-centric local host Larry Hughes, ESPN Radio, and assorted other programming including the rights to the New York Yankees, New York Giants, New York Jets, and Marist College men's basketball. Complaints that programming leaned too much towards one area or another, plus the high numbers of WABC from New York City, doomed this format. On August 28, 2000, WEOK and WALL flipped to ESPN Radio as its primary format as 1340/1390 ESPN Radio though Larry Hughes would remain for nearly another year, and a brokered financial information show which dated back to the standards format would continue to air. Not long after this flip, the Crystal group was sold to Aurora Communications though most of Crystal's employees survived the move. The ESPN Radio simulcast worked in the short- term, however the flip of WEVD in New York City (whose signal is directional to the north) to the format in August 2001 led to an uncertain future for the format. After Aurora was bought out by Cumulus Media in April 2002 and new management came in, several new formats were explored ranging from a second try at talk radio to Radio Disney. The research-obsessed Cumulus decided to switch to a Spanish language format since it seemed that the Spanish population was growing in the Hudson Valley. In September 2002, WEOK/WALL flipped to El Ritmo (\\"The Rhythm\\"), a Spanish Contemporary format Program Director Nick Robbins and the first of its sort in upstate New York. The new format was seen with a critical eye as some saw that Cumulus was ahead of their time, some saw that it would have done better on an FM frequency, and some others saw the move Cumulus as ignoring the far larger African-American population. Nevertheless, the hit-or-miss nature of El Ritmo's audience, concentrated in the cities of the area, led to the station getting little, if any, ratings and being a hard sell towards advertisers given that the overall Hispanic market share of the Hudson Valley is minuscule at best. Though with some community support, the lack of support and lack of clients led Cumulus to flip WEOK and WALL in March 2005 to Radio Disney, the format it had nearly taken three years earlier. After almost five years as Radio Disney, WEOK and WALL changed formats in February 2010 to The True Oldies Channel. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie (including WEOK) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. On January 8, 2015 WEOK changed their format to regional Mexican, branded as \\"Fierro\\".WALL/WEOK Flips to Regional Mexican On October 30, 2015 WEOK changed their format to Spanish adult hits, branded as \\"Juan AM\\". Notable alumni Jay Reynolds (currently of ESPN Radio) was former anchor of WEOK's 5 O'Clock News Mike Breen, voice of the NY Knicks, also worked as a local newsman Mark Mahoney, 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner, editorial writing.

Early life Trevelyan was the only child to survive to adulthood of Robert Calverley Trevelyan and his wife Elizabeth van der Hoeven. His grandfather was the liberal politician Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, and his uncle the historian George Macaulay Trevelyan; he is the great-uncle of his namesake, Julian Trevelyan the pianist. Julian Trevelyan was educated at Bedales School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read English Literature. Artistic career He moved to Paris to become an artist, enrolling at Atelier Dix-Sept, Stanley William Hayter's engraving school, where he learned etching. He worked alongside artists including Max Ernst, Oskar Kokoschka, Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso. In 1935, Trevelyan bought Durham Wharf, beside the River Thames in Hammersmith, London. This became his home and studio for the rest of his life and was a source of artistic inspiration to him. He became a confirmed Surrealist and exhibited at the International Surrealist Exhibition, held at the New Burlington Galleries in London. From 1950 to 1955, Trevelyan taught history of art and etching at the Chelsea School of Art. From 1955–63, Trevelyan worked at the Royal College of Art and became Head of the Etching Department. Because of his enthusiasm in his work and the desire to share it with others, Trevelyan became a highly influential teacher, with students including David Hockney, Ron Kitaj and Norman Ackroyd. He was an important leader of modern print techniques and today is regarded as a silent driving force behind the etching revolution of the 1960s. In 1969, he produced the Thames Suite, a collection of 12 views of the Thames from its upper reaches in Oxford and Henley-on-Thames down to the tidal stretches of London and the Estuary. Wartime camoufleur Along with other artists such as Roland Penrose, during the Second World War, Trevelyan served as a Camouflage Officer. He was a member of the Royal Engineers from 1940 to 1943, serving in North Africa and Palestine. Arriving in the \\"Western Desert\\" town of Tobruk, North Africa, Trevelyan realized that standard British army green and brown splotches were ineffective as desert camouflage. He and the other camoufleurs, working under Hugh Cott and Geoffrey Barkas, became expert at desert camouflage and deception. By 1942, they were able to deceive the German Afrika Korps, creating a dummy army which successfully tied down German forces, while real tanks were concealed or disguised as trucks and other equipment. Awards and distinctions In July 1986, Trevelyan was awarded a senior fellowship at the Royal College of Art and in September 1987 he was appointed a Royal Academician. Family He married the potter Ursula Darwin, daughter of Bernard Darwin and his wife Elinor (née Monsall) on 30 July 1934. She was a great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin; their marriage was dissolved in 1950. Their son is the film-maker Philip Trevelyan. Trevelyan's second wife was the painter Mary Fedden; they married in 1951. Trevelyan died on 12 July 1988 in Hammersmith, London. Works and exhibitions Trevelyan's first solo exhibition was at the Lefevre Gallery in 1937. His work has been exhibited at Waddington Galleries (commissioned a series of etchings), New Grafton Gallery, Bohun Gallery, River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, the Bloomsbury Gallery, Messum's, the New Burlington Galleries in London, and Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, among other places.Bohun Gallery In 1998 a major Retrospective 'Julian Trevelyan:The Imaginative Impulse was held at the Royal College of Art which subsequently toured to Royal West of England Academy, Bristol; Laing Gallery Newcastle, and Mercer Art Gallery, Harrogate with accompanying catalogue published by Bohun.

WALL is owned by Charles Williamson, through licensee Digital Radio Broadcasting, Inc., and broadcasts at 1340 kHz with 1,000 watts, daytime and nighttime, both nondirectional from a transmitter in Middletown. Its studios are in Poughkeepsie, New York. WALL broadcast's on the following translator's and one repeater: Early history WALL came to air on August 2, 1942, the first radio station in the western part of Orange County, part of a series of low-powered local stations that took to the air in the period after the 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement and realignment. WALL signed on with a full-service popular music format with a heavy amount of local news, and with only newspapers as competition, were successful. The station was owned by the Community Broadcasting Corporation whose partners were Roger Clipp, an executive with Triangle Publications (WFIL in Philadelphia) and John Morgan Davis, who ultimately served as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. In 1950, WALL hired Jim Patt from WNBH in New Bedford, Massachusetts, as General Manager; he ran the station until 1972. On- air personalities included Bill Swanwick (\\"Breakfast With Beaming Billy\\"), Jerry Wax (\\"The Wax Works\\"), longtime staffer Joe Ryan and Big Jim Pappas; Al Larson served as news director, with Johnny Zaimes in charge of sales. Dominance in the 1960s and 1970s The station was sold to R. Peter Straus, owner of WMCA in New York City (\\"home of the Good Guys\\"). Straus, who had aspirations to become a United States Senator, bought WALL as well as stations in Utica and Geneva, New York, so his editorials could be heard throughout the state. In 1964, however, Robert F. Kennedy decided to run for the Senate, ending Straus's political plans. Patt stayed on to run WALL for Straus, putting WALL-FM on the air, but when Straus sold his stations, Patt decided it was time to retire to Fort Myers, Florida, where he teamed up again with Roger Clipp to put a station on the air in that market. By the mid-60s, WALL had evolved into a Middle of the Road format, and on November 11, 1966 would add FM service at 92.7 MHz (today's WRRV). It was with the FM launch that WALL switched to Top 40. In 1968, the station hired program director Larry Berger, who spent the previous two years as music director of WWRL in New York City.Berger, Larry \\"FM Radio History Interview with Larry Berger\\", August 25, 2013 In 1972, Straus Communications sold all their radio properties except WMCA. WALL was bought by Oroco Communications, Inc., headed by James F. O'Grady, Jr., who retained most of the staff and continued the Top 40 format on WALL (AM). Shortly after taking the reins, Oroco decided to split the FM into the \\"beautiful music\\" format using an early automation system by Bonneville Program Services. Art Livesey was made program director of the FM. The move was a departure, but WALL-FM would still simulcast the live all-night and morning drive shows on WALL well into the 1970s. In 1973, Berger was hired by ABC to program their Detroit album-oriented rock station, WRIF, and Dave Pound from New York's WNEW (now WBBR) was named WALL's program director. When Berger brought some of WALL's talent with him, Pound brought in newcomers – among them Howard Hoffman,Howard Hoffman, WALL Middletown, NY March 1975 at ReelRadio Top 40 Radio Repository, April 13, 2014 Randy West, Simon Hendrix and John Fischer - to fill the vacancies. The \\"NINE!\\" satire tape In August 1974, WALL staffers Randy West and Howard Hoffman, along with radio friends Pete Salant and Russ DiBello, recorded a satirical tape known as \\"NINE!\\", a parody of industry marketing pitches and radio programming in general. The recording session took place in the WALL production studios after Hoffman's on-air shift ended at midnight. The tape, which takes place at fictional radio station AM 900 WVWA/Pound Ridge, New York, documents the progression of a top 40 station from earlier, awkward years (with odd sound effects, rambling disc jockeys, dead air, and wildly inaccurate weather forecasts) to a finely-tuned, professional-sounding station with various gimmicks, catch-phrases and promotions popular at the time. Ultimately, WVWA decides to go one step further and strip out all spoken-word content, leaving only a rapid-fire, barely intelligible station identification once an hour and the word \\"NINE!\\" screamed between each song. Even before an ending could be added to it, \\"NINE\\" immediately turned viral in the entire radio industry when an unfinished copy found its way to New York City's 99X (now WEPN-FM). The creators decided to leave the planned ending off since the payoff stood well on its own. Fire and aftermath At about 8 p.m. on Sunday, December 21, 1975, WALL suffered a fire which gutted its North Street studios, killing several residents in a third-floor apartment, and forcing the station to move to an abandoned, block-long Armory building in Middletown. WALL was off the air less than half an hour; using remote broadcast equipment that was stored at the transmitter site on Monhagen Avenue, the station began broadcasting from the transmitter building using records borrowed from employees. The old Armory building had already been purchased by Oroco (which changed its name to Castle Communications to commemorate the acquisition), with the intent of moving the radio station there within a year; instead, the move happened overnight. WALL signed on from the Armory at 6 o’clock the morning after the fire, using remote equipment borrowed from sister station WHVW in Hyde Park, New York. Temporary studios were quickly constructed in a basement gym, with permanent studios constructed as originally planned on the second floor of the Armory, and offices on the first floor. In 1979, WALL and sister WKGL (the former WALL-FM) were purchased by a consortium headed by media mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman and New York air personality Bruce Morrow (\\"Cousin Brucie\\"). Headquartering their group in Middletown at the Armory (now re-christened \\"Broadcast Plaza\\"), major changes took place with WALL flipping first to a top 40/adult contemporary hybrid format, and later to Adult standards; WKGL went to an oldies format. The change was not a long-term success, and Morrow sold WALL and WKGL to Bell Broadcasting. 1980s and 1990s By 1985 WALL began to regroup by bringing in program director Rob Dillman and flipping to a higher- energy oldies format. With this change came the acquisition of sports programming such as New York Mets baseball, New York Giants football, and various local sports and other community events. Additionally, WALL rehired some of the air talent from its top 40 heyday, including Joe Ryan. In the WALL's \\"45th Anniversary Reunion Broadcast\\", on the weekend of August 2–3, 1987, the station looked back to its past and reunited air personalities including \\"Cousin Brucie\\", Howard Hoffman, Dave Charity, John Fisher, Ray Arthur, Randy West, Gene Pelc, Al Faust, Art Livesay, Alex Miller, Dick Wells, Jim Frey, Mark West, Chris Rogers, Jim Brownold, Jon LeMieux, Jimmy Howes, Paul Paulson (Bruno), Jim Pappas and Al Larson. In September 1988, local power company Orange and Rockland Utilities purchased WALL and WKGL (now WRRV); with the sale came a mass purge of staff with WALL flipping to a satellite news- talk format in all but mornings. There would be no fiftieth anniversary celebration in 1992: Joe Ryan died, as did news man Al Larson. In 1994, Orange and Rockland sold WALL and WKOJ to the Poughkeepsie-based Crystal Radio Group. Despite slumping ratings, WALL's news-talk format continued undisturbed for most of the rest of the 1990s. WKOJ's format was changed to modern rock and its calls to WRRV; the station remains the same as of 2013. WEOK simulcast history :(for a detailed history on these formats, see the article on WEOK) While WALL was left alone and did moderately well given its signal and status in the market, Crystal Radio had problems with WEOK given the aging demographics of that station's longtime adult standards format. Looking at an opportunity to fortify their holdings, in August 1999 Crystal decided to join WEOK with WALL and renovate WALL's talk format into a station that would target all of the Hudson Valley. On September 6, 1999, WEOK dumped pop standards and joined with WALL to simulcast talk, a format known as NewsTalk 13. John Moultrie, WALL's morning man since switching to talk, was dumped in favor of WEOK's Larry Hughes. (Moultrie later turned up doing afternoons on WTBQ; and mornings at WVOS.) Up against the highly rated WABC in New York (and sharing much of its programming), the NewsTalk 13 simulcast struggled to find an audience, especially in Middletown; many listeners there thought the new station was too \\"Poughkeepsie-centric\\". In August 2000, the ESPN Radio programming that the station aired nights and weekends became the full-time format of the station. Soon, Aurora Communications would purchase the assets of the Crystal Radio Group. Both NewsTalk 13 and the ESPN Radio simulcast featured a large amount of sports rights including Yankees baseball, Giants and Jets football, and Marist College basketball. Aurora's ownership of the station would prove to be short-lived; in October 2001 they were purchased by Cumulus Media. At 2 pm on September 15, 2002 (following the rueful announcement \\"This was ESPN Radio\\"), WALL and WEOK flipped to a Spanish language Hot AC format as El Ritmo (\\"The Rhythm\\"), the first Spanish-language station in the Hudson Valley. Poor ratings and revenues led Cumulus, in March 2005, to flip the stations again, this time to Radio Disney; Cumulus had actually considered switching to Disney three years earlier. True Oldies Channel and return to live radio On February 22, 2010 the WEOK and WALL simulcast dropped Radio Disney for Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel, a syndicated format similar to the top-40 WALL of the 1960s and 70s (and the high-energy oldies format of the mid-80s). With the switch, WEOK and WALL stopped being a true simulcast, running liners, jingles and commercials specific to each station. On April 11, 2011, former WALL personality Mark West brought live radio back to Middletown for the first time since 1999 when he began programming a local morning show from his studio in New Hampton, New York. West leased the morning shift (6–10 a.m. weekdays) from Townsquare Media and sold commercials and covered local news. Ownership under Townsquare Media On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WALL) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. On January 8, 2015, WALL changed its format to regional Mexican, branded as \\"Fierro\\". Mark West's brokered program in English continued, on a month-by-month basis, until May 8. Due to community outrage over the change in format, a Facebook campaign was launched demanding that the Mark West show remain, and the oldies format returned. Effective October 30, 2015, WALL was sold to Charles Williamson's Digital Radio Broadcasting, Inc., in exchange for the license of translator W239AC. On November 9, 2015, WALL changed its format to classic hits.

Hamish Hamilton, 1942) The Song of Bernadette (German: Das Lied von Bernadette) is a 1941 novel that tells the story of Saint Bernadette Soubirous, who, from February to July 1858 reported eighteen visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes, France. The novel was written by Franz Werfel and translated into English by Lewis Lewisohn in 1942. It was extremely popular, spending more than a year on the New York Times Best Seller list and 13 weeks in first place. The novel was adapted into the 1943 film The Song of Bernadette, starring Jennifer Jones. Origins Franz Werfel was a German- speaking Jew born in Prague in 1890. He became well known as a playwright. In the 1930s in Vienna, he began writing popular satirical plays lampooning the Nazi regime until the Anschluss, when the Third Reich under Adolf Hitler annexed Austria in 1938. Werfel and his wife Alma (Gustav Mahler's widow) fled to Paris until the Germans invaded France in 1940. In his Personal Preface to The Song of Bernadette, Franz Werfel takes up the story: Hunted by the Gestapo, the Werfels experienced anxiety for their hosts as well as themselves. A number of families took turns in giving them shelter. These people told the Werfels the story of Bernadette. Werfel vowed that, if he and his wife escaped, he would put off all tasks and write Bernadette's story into a novel. Plot The story is about the Platonic love relationship between Bernadette and “the lady” of her vision. Bernadette’s love for the lady attains “ecstasy” when in her presence at a grotto near Lourdes. The love she feels sustains her throughout the trials and tribulations which she is made to endure by doubters and by public officials who see her as a threat to the established order, which is based on a secular milieu. The lady guides Bernadette to the discovery of a stream which springs from beneath the ground of the grotto. The curative powers of the water are discovered by various town folk, and the word is spread by them. Bernadette does no proselytizing. The lady informs Bernadette of her wishes to have a chapel build on the site of the grotto, and to have processions to the site. Bernadette informs church and secular officials about this, but takes no action to have it done. Eventually, it gets done. Bernadette does not actively cultivate a following, but people are attracted to her by the love she radiates and by witnessing the ecstatic trance she experiences when she has visions of the lady at the grotto. Bernadette does no preaching or evangelizing, but her behavior of itself converts doubters, and the very church officials who once doubted her become her protectors and advocates. Although she is dying of tuberculosis, she refuses to seek a cure from the lady, or to drink the curative water. She is canonized several years after her death. The story of Bernadette Soubirous and Our Lady of Lourdes is told by Werfel with many embellishments, such as the chapter in which Bernadette is invited to board at the home of a rich woman who thinks Bernadette's visionary \\"lady\\" might be her deceased daughter. In side-stories and back story, the history of the town of Lourdes, the contemporary political situation in France, and the responses of believers and detractors are delineated. Werfel describes Bernadette as a religious peasant girl who would have preferred to continue on with an ordinary life, but takes the veil as a nun after she is told that because \\"Heaven chose her\\", she must choose Heaven. Bernadette's service as a sacristan, artist-embroiderer, and nurse in the convent are depicted, along with her spiritual growth. After her death, her body as well as her life are scrutinized for indications that she is a saint, and at last she is canonized. The novel is laid out in five sections of ten chapters each, in a deliberate nod to the Catholic Rosary. Unusual for a novel, the entire first part, which describes the events on the day that Bernadette first saw the Virgin Mary, is told in the present tense, as if it were happening at the moment. The rest of the novel is in the past tense. Major themes Werfel presents Bernadette as a simple and pious girl from a poor family, who is regarded as stupid by her teachers, classmates, and authorities. He also depicts her as having inner strength and personal integrity, which is unshaken by those who challenge her stories of the \\"Lady of Massabielle\\" whom she alone can see. Bernadette is not a crusader, but the local people take up the cause of turning the grotto into a spiritual site, although the local authorities resist at first. This drama is played out against the larger canvas of French politics and the contemporary social climate. Explanatory digressions illustrate what Werfel perceives as an ongoing conflict between a human need to believe in the supernatural or in anomalous phenomena; a true religion, which should not address such \\"popular\\" manifestations; and the ideas of the Enlightenment and of atheism. References to history, geography and current science Apparently, Werfel obtained accounts of Bernadette from Lourdes families whose older members had known her. It is possible that a great deal of folklore and legend had been added to the plain facts by the time Werfel heard the tale. Lourdes pilgrims often want to know more about Bernadette and do not realize that, far from being a simple-minded shepherdess, she was a self-possessed young woman who stood by her story in the face of tough church and government inquiry. Werfel was able to work this aspect of her personality into his narration. However, Werfel was not above fictionalization to fill in details or romanticize her story. He embellished the anti-religious feeling of the prosecutor, Vital Dutour (who, according to one source, altered Bernadette's answers to his questions to make her sound visionaryLourdes: geology of the grotto of Massabielle, apparitions of Our Lady, St Bernadette), and transformed the relationship between Bernadette and Antoine Nicolau from one of friendship to one of unrequited love on Nicolau's part;Biography Online: The Song of Bernadette when she leaves Lourdes to become a nun, he vows never to wed. Werfel's work also features a highly dramatic and fictionalized death scene. In the book, Bernadette cries out in a loud, strong voice, \\"J'aime (I love)\\" followed by a whispered \\"Now and in the hour...\\" before her voice fails; the point of view characters are a) Sister Marie Thérèse Vauzous, Bernadette's former elementary school teacher, who, by the power of Bernadette's cry of love and transfigured expression, is converted from skepticism to belief that Bernadette's Lady is present in the room and b) Father Marie Dominique Peyramale, who is revitalized physically and spiritually by Bernadette's death.The Song of Bernadette by Franz Werfel, p. 564-566 In real life, however, Bernadette was in torment during the last day of her life, asking the other nuns to pray for her soul, and her last words—said twice—were \\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a poor sinner.\\" Following this, according to Sister Nathalie Portat, she made the sign of the cross, drank a few drops of water and died.Biography Online: Bernadette Soubirous Also, while a nun by the name of Marie Thérèse Vauzous was in charge of the novices at the monastery of Nevers where Bernadette was cloistered, she was neither the daughter of a general nor Bernadette's former schoolteacher. Bernadette first met her at Nevers. And the historic Dean Marie Dominique Peyramale had been dead for about a year and a half by the time that Bernadette herself perished on 16 April 1879.Understanding Franz Werfel by Hans Wagener, p. 150 However, in the preface, Werfel states that readers will justifiably ask \\"What is true and what is invented?\\" Werfel answers: \\"All the memorable happenings that constitute the substance of this book took place in the world of reality. Since their beginning dates back no longer than eighty years [N.B. at the time Werfel wrote the book], there beats upon them the bright light of modern history and their truth has been confirmed by friend and foe and by cool observers through faithful testimonies. My story makes no changes in this body of truth. I exercised my right of creative freedom only where the work, as a work of art, demanded certain chronological condensations or where there was need of striking the spark of life from the hardened substance.\\" The Song of Bernadette, Ignatius Press; Rep Tra edition (October 1, 2006), pages xiv-xv. He declares: \\"The Song of Bernadette is a novel but not a fictive work.\\" The Song of Bernadette, Ignatius Press; Rep Tra edition (October 1, 2006), page xiv. It seems to have been inspired in part by Émile Zola's Lourdes (1884), a blistering denunciation of the industry that sprang up in Lourdes around the allegedly miraculous spring. One of Werfel's characters, Hyacinthe de Lafite, a member of the freethinkers' club that hangs around the town cafe, is not only fictional but a thinly disguised portrayal of Zola himself, re-imagined as a failed journalist/author who smugly casts Bernadette's experience in terms of the pagan history of the area: \\"The shepherd girl out of the antique world who, in the year 1858, sees the guardian nymph of the spring and redeems her from two thousand years of boredom[.]\\" By the end of the book, Lafite, the lady's \\"proudest foe\\", believing himself to be dying of cancer, is \\"lying on his knees\\" before the image of Bernadette's lady in the grotto, and crying out, \\"Bernadette Soubirous, pray for me!\\"The Song of Bernadette by Franz Werfel, p. 554 Werfel goes into great detail about the cures at the Lourdes Spring, and has Dr. Dozous, the town physician, show Hyacinthe through the wards of the hospital, particularly a dormitory of women with a particularly virulent form of Lupus vulgaris in which the face rots and falls off. Werfel provides medical details and claims that some such women have been completely cured after washing in water from the spring, and reports that many more healings take place during the Blessing of the Eucharist ceremony which is held daily at the grotto. Werfel's description of the veiled lupus sufferers is very similar to that of Zola's description of Elise Rouquet, whose nose and mouth are being eaten away by lupus, on pages 13-14 of Lourdes. Rouquet is also the Zola character who bathes her face in water from the Lourdes spring; one sore on her face improves, but the doctors are unable to decide, throughout the book, whether she actually had lupus or some other illness that responds well to washing or if the partial cure is psychosomatic. No such indecision plagues Dr. Dozous or his fellow physicians; in Chapter 46 of The Song of Bernadette, \\"The Hell of the Flesh,\\" he implausibly informs the fictional Lafite that one of the lupus patients bathed her face in water from the spring and that she \\"didn't realize at first that she had a nose and mouth again.\\" Copyright The Song of Bernadette has been in the public domain in the European Union since 1 January 2016.

Sunn pests are found in parts of North Africa, throughout West Asia and many of the new independent states of Central Asia. The sunn pest is one of the most serious pests of wheat and barley in West Asia, where over $42 million (U.S.) is spent for its control. Yield loss from its damage has been estimated at 20-30% in barley and 50-90% in wheat. This insect damages these crops by feeding on leaves, stems and grains. During feeding they also inject chemicals that greatly reduce the baking quality of flour made from damaged wheat. If 2-3% of the grain is damaged, entire lots may be ruined because the flour will be unpalatable and the bread will not rise.University of Vermont Heavy attack causes wheat stems to break before harvest. Large areas of wheat sometimes remain unharvested because sunn pest damage is so severe. These insects also attack barley, though damage is usually low. Large outbreaks of sunn pests generally occur every 6 to 8 years and can potentially cause yield losses of tens of millions of dollars. Sunn pest management Currently, there is not a pest management strategy to control the sunn pest on a national or global scale. However, there are a number of methods that farmers can utilize to help limit the damage caused by these insects. #Monitor pest populations; sunn pest populations vary from year to year in response to climatic conditions. Pest populations should be monitored annually to determine if it is necessary to spray for the insect. Keeping records of population levels is beneficial. #Plant early-maturing wheat varieties and harvest early; damage is less if wheat is harvested before sunn pest reach adulthood. Growing early-maturing varieties and establishing a regional uniform planting date minimizes damage. Early harvesting methods must be developed in relation to local production methods and weather conditions. #Maintain shelter belts around wheat fields. Natural enemies reduce sunn pest populations and should be encouraged. Cereal crops should not be grown on marginal lands in the foothills. These areas should remain as uncultivated habitats where flowers and grow undisturbed, providing shelter and alternative food sources, which improve survival of these beneficial insects. #Use chemical insecticides only if needed. Selective insecticides should only be used when pest populations reach economically damaging levels. Applications should be made when adults move into cereal fields. Research has been ongoing for decades to develop and improve management of the sunn pest. In 1997, scientists from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), the University of Vermont, and national agricultural researchers throughout the infested region began working together to develop a model sunn pest integrated management plan. Sunn pest research A cooperative program between the University of Vermont Entomology Research Laboratory and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), in Aleppo, Syria was initiated in 1997. Several strains of entomopathogenic fungi have been isolated from insects in their over wintering sites in Turkey, Syria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Russia. In laboratory bioassays, they were tested against sunn pests, tarnished plant bug and western flower thrips. Several were highly pathogenic to all of these insects, and selected for further evaluation. The next step in the development of these biological agents is to determine at what stage in the pests' life cycle fungi could best be used. Two possibilities are #As they migrate to the fields in the early spring #In their over wintering sites among the foothills surrounding the fields. Six of the most promising isolates were tested in on-plant and in- litter bioassays in January 2000. Several of the tested isolates provided 80-100% mortality within 10 days. Though sunn pest mortality occurred more rapidly among the in-litter assays, by day 15 sunn pest mortality was equally high in the on-plant assays. These results demonstrate the great potential of fungi for sunn pest integrated pest management. It may be possible to use them both in over-wintering sites and on plants in the field. Plans are underway to conduct small-scale pilot tests to further evaluate their efficacy under field conditions. The compatibility of fungi with non-target organisms and chemical pesticides are also planned for the future.

Original show (1970s and 1980s) The original version was broadcast from 1977 until 1986 on the ABC on Sunday mornings. It was normally hosted by Drew Morphett with a panel consisting of former players and pundits. Two matches from the previous day's Victorian Football League (VFL) fixtures would be screened and the panel would speculate about the games along with the league ladder and the goal, mark and play of the day. The format of the show was comprehensive, yet devoted mainly to matters on the field. Today it appears simplistic when compared with modern football's more saturated and market driven media coverage. New show (2000-2011) A new version of The Winners returned on the Fox Footy Channel in 2002, hosted by Clinton Grybas, showing highlights of all eight AFL games from the weekend in a one-hour show. From 2007 to 2011, it was shown on Fox Sports on the Monday night following the round. In 2012, the show was removed as AFL 360 expanded from one night to four nights a week. Rebooted (2015) A new iteration of the show was launched in 2015, known as The Winners Rebooted. Hosted once again by Drew Morphett, the show once again aired on Fox Footy.

K. Chesterton's final collection of detective stories, published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the Storyteller magazine. The Unmentionable Man was unique to the book. The stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond (we are not told his first name). He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous paradoxical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: \\"he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss... but he's really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesn't talk about them; he doesn't want to talk about them... but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually done – well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contradictory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life.\\"From \\"Pond the Pantaloon\\" Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings,The Eccentric Prince of Paradox but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Pond's: In four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, \\"Pond the Pantaloon\\", Wotton tells the story. In two more, \\"The Crime of Captain Gahagan\\" and \\"The Terrible Troubadour\\", Pond's keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In \\"Ring of Lovers\\" Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it. These stories written at the end of Chesterton's career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story The Crime of Captain Gahagan Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that \\"Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midnight.\\" Characters The main characters in the book are Mr. Pond, his friend Captain Peter Gahagan, a romantic and impulsive Irishman, and a well-known government official, Sir Hubert Wotton. Also mentioned in more than one chapter are Violet Varney, an actress, and her sister Joan, to whom Gahagan proposes after being suspected of having an affair with Lord Crome's wife in \\"Ring of Lovers\\". Joan, now married to Gahagan, appears in the framing sequence of \\"A Tall Story\\". Stories The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse The paradox is introduced when a casual discussion turns to matters of European politics, and Pond recalls an episode during a war between the Prussians and the Polish. The fact, insists Pond, to Wotton's dismay, is that the Prussian soldiers were too obedient. Marshal Von Grock failed in his attempt to execute the influential Polish poet and singer Paul Petrowski because two of his soldiers did precisely what he asked. :The whole thing went wrong because the discipline was too good. Grock's soldiers obeyed him too well; so he simply couldn't do a thing he wanted....It is a military fact that Grock failed, because two of his soldiers obeyed him. It is a military fact that he might have succeeded, if one of them had disobeyed him. The Crime of Captain Gahagan The chapter begins with Pond being interviewed by a garrulous American journalist who cannot finish a sentence without interrupting herself. This supplies a clue to Pond when a lawyer accuses Pond's acquaintance Captain Gahagan of murdering his client, the husband of a woman Gahagan had been spending much time with. After hearing the lawyer's story of what Gahagan said when leaving the Varney house, Pond introduces the paradox: Gahagan said exactly the same thing to all three witnesses, despite their conflicting reports. When Doctors Agree The paradox, simply put, is that two doctors once agreed so thoroughly that one naturally murdered the other. In the framing sequence mention is made of an agreement between the Poles and the Lithuanians about Wilno, and Pond mentions Tweedledum and Tweedledee (who agreed to have a battle) and tells the story of a protracted argument over morality which came to an abrupt conclusion. Pond the Pantaloon Pond introduces the paradox—that the pencil was relatively red, which was why it made such black marks—but Gahagan must go to Wotton for the explanation. Wotton tells the story of how Pond saved England and was shot at five times in a railway station waiting room, all because of the \\"pencil\\" which made the \\"black marks\\". The Unmentionable Man During a discussion of deportation, Pond mentions a man who was so well-regarded that officials longed to deport him – but could not. In the capital of a European republic with an oppressive government and an active revolutionary movement, Mr Louis sits in the central square and entertains all and sundry. His identity is a well-kept secret, but Pond guesses it. Ring of Lovers This story centres on Captain Gahagan, described by Mr. Pond as \\"a very truthful man... [who] tells wanton and unnecessary lies\\". The captain tells a (true) story of a dreadful dinner party which ended in death, and explains how it induced him to propose to the woman he loves. The Terrible Troubadour The paradox, \\"In Nature you must go very low to find things that go so high\\", in this case is not Mr. Pond's, but his friend Dr. Paul Green's. Green introduces the Vicar of Hanging Burgess, who accuses Captain Gahagan of having, many years ago, shot a rival in love, dumped the body and then run away to the war. From the Vicar's eyewitness description of the incident, Pond divines the truth. A Tall Story Mr Pond, Sir Henry Wotton, Captain Gahagan and his new wife Joan are discussing the treatment of Jews in Germany, and Pond recalls an incident in the last war when a Jew who had adopted a German name was suspected of being a spy. He describes the persecution of officials by \\"spy-maniacs\\" who reported all sorts of \\"suspicious behaviour\\", while the real spies passed unnoticed—including the spy who was \\"too tall to be seen\\". Radio 5 of the 8 stories (1,2,4,6,7 of the list above) were produced as 15 minute radio stories for BBC Radio 4 Extra, read by Martin Jarvis. Broadcast 13-17 May 2014.

IWBF is recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as the sole competent authority in wheelchair basketball worldwide. International Basketball Federation (or FIBA) has recognized IWBF under Article 53 of its General Statutes. History In 1973, the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) established the first Sub-section for wheelchair basketball. At that time ISMGF was the world governing body for all wheelchair sports. In 1989, ISMGF accepted the name International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) for its former sub-section. With this step wheelchair basketball began its journey for full independence and in 1993 IWBF was established as the world body for wheelchair basketball with full responsibility for development of the sport. Over the next five years IWBF membership grew in size and the federation configured itself into 4 geographical zones. Zone Structure IWBF studied several models before creating its current zone structure. Based on the number of National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWB) with active programs at the national and international level it was decided that IWBF Americas and IWBF Europe could be the same as FIBA Americas and FIBA Europe. However, because of the limited number of countries with active programs in the rest of the world, IWBF chose to combine some regions to create better developmental and competitive opportunities within the zone. As a result, the last two zones of IWBF are IWBF Asia Oceania and IWBF Africa. As of 2003, IWBF has 76 NOWB actively participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world with this number increasing each year. Executive Council IWBF President Maureen Orchard leads the team managers' meeting, 2010 IWBF is governed by an Executive Council that is elected at the World Congress every four years. Philip Craven (Great Britain) who had served as Chairperson of the ISMGF wheelchair basketball Section since 1988 was elected in 1993 as the first President of IWBF. In 2001, Brendan Hancock was elected to the position of President of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and retired as president of IWBF at the World Congress in 2002. Maureen Orchard (Canada) was elected as only the second president of IWBF at that same World Congress in Kitakyushu, Japan in 2002. Classification  In order to make the competitions fair, each player receives a point in regard their physical ability called class, from 1.0 which is the lowest class with the maximum physical disability to the 4.5 which is highest class with the lowest physical disability. The person who performs classification called classifier. Classifiers have Bronze, Silver and Gold badges according to their knowledge and experience. Recently the classification rules made changes and have only two levels, namely the national classifier, the zone classifier and the International Classifier. Don Perriman (Australia) is the current President of Classification Commission, Kenneth McKay(Great Britain) Gold Classifier, Gholamhossein Shahrabadi(Iran) Gold Classier, Toufic Allouch (Lebanon Wheelchair basketball national organizations around the world Wheelchair basketball national organizations have developed in a variety of ways. Most started out the same way as IWBF, as a sub-section of a national wheelchair sport organization. As IWBF matured so did many of its member organizations and now there are several models that IWBF embraces within its membership. In Mexico the wheelchair basketball organizations are a part of their National Paralympic Committee(NPC). Australia is part of the Australian Wheelchair Athletes Ltd., and others are under the umbrella of a National Disabled Federation such as Bahrain who are part of the Bahrain Disabled Sports Federation. In the Netherlands wheelchair basketball is fully integrated into the Nederlandse Basketball Bond and in Canada the Canadian Wheelchair Basketball Association is fully independent. In all cases where a member is part of a larger federation the IWBF only recognizes the part of that federation responsible for wheelchair basketball.

The group is known for producing electric shocks for defense. Both species are deep-sea rays endemic to the waters off New Zealand. They are not to be confused with the blind electric rays of the genus Benthobatis. Taxonomy Typhlonarke was created by Edgar R. Waite, in a 1909 issue of the scientific journal Records of the Canterbury Museum. Species * Typhlonarke aysoni A. Hamilton, 1902 (Blind electric ray) * Typhlonarke tarakea Phillipps, 1929 (Oval electric ray) Distribution and habitat Both Typhlonarke species are native to New Zealand; the exact distribution of each species is uncertain due to confusion between the two. They have been caught by trawls off the east coast of North Island south of East Cape, South Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura, Chatham Rise (Mernoo Bank and Chatham Islands), and the Snares Shelf. They occur at a depth of 46–800 meters, but most are found between 300 and 400 meters. Description The blind electric rays are small, flat cartilaginous fish with the round pectoral fin disc characteristic of electric rays, a short, fleshy tail, and one dorsal fin. The front part of their pelvic fins are modified for walking, while the back is fused to the disk. Their eyes are not visible externally and are practically useless, hence the name. The coloration is dark brown above and lighter below. T. aysoni grows to a maximum length of 38 cm and T. tarakea to 35 cm. Biology and ecology The flabby disc and rudimentary tail of the blind electric rays suggest that they are poor swimmers. Instead, examination of their anatomy suggests that they may push themselves along the bottom using the modified forward lobes of their pelvic fins, called \\"crurae\\". These structures have also evolved independently in other benthic rays, including species of Raja, Cruriraja and Anacanthobatis, and are believed to be an adaptation for feeding on invertebrates in the substrate. The diet of Typhlonarke includes polychaete worms. Reproduction is likely ovoviviparous, as with the other species in the family, with litters of up to 11 pups. The young measure 9–10 cm at birth. Human interactions The IUCN Red List assesses both species as Data Deficient (DD); although they are apparently rare, confusion between the two species has made their distribution and population status uncertain. As they are benthic fishes, blind electric rays are potentially vulnerable to bottom trawling as their range coincides with major commercial trawling fisheries. No current conservation measures are in place for the genus.

Stewart (born 1966) is a former phlebotomist from Columbia, Illinois, who was convicted in December 1998 of injecting his son (formerly Bryan Stewart Jr. now known as Brryan Jackson) with HIV-contaminated blood.  Child abuse incident  On February 6, 1992 in St Joseph's Hospital West, in Lake St. Louis, Missouri, Stewart's 11 month-old son Jackson was treated for asthma and pneumonia when he was infected with the virus. Jackson's mother contacted Stewart to inform him that their son was in the hospital. When he arrived, he sent Jackson's mother to the cafe to get a beverage. Stewart then allegedly injected tainted blood into his son. When Jackson's mother returned, her son was screaming in his fathers arms. The tainted blood was incompatible with Jackson's. The boy was diagnosed with AIDS in 1996. One night his pediatrician had a nightmare and awoke to call the hospital to tell them to test for HIV. Results came back positive, along with three infections. On April 22, 1998, Stewart was charged with first-degree assault; the county prosecutor stated that this was because first-degree assault results in a longer sentence than attempted murder. Prosecutors stated that Stewart was a phlebotomist who had daily access to blood, and Stewart's co-workers testified that Stewart had previously made threats to harm people using contaminated blood when he was angry. The motive behind the crime was Stewart's desire to avoid paying child support to the boy's mother. A Missouri jury found Stewart guilty of first- degree assault on December 6, 1998. Stewart's attorney, Joe Murphy, said that \\"My client has maintained all along that he is innocent\\" and also claimed that \\"Mom made an allegation and everyone ran with it.\\" On January 9, 1999, Stewart was sentenced to life imprisonment at St. Charles County Circuit Court. Judge Ellsworth Cundiff said that the maximum sentence was inadequate, and told Stewart \\"injecting a child with the HIV virus really puts you in the same category as the worst war criminal\\" and \\"when God finally calls you, you are going to burn in hell from here to eternity.\\" Stewart became eligible for parole in 2011, but was twice denied it and will become eligible again in 2021.

It is situated on the northern flank of the South Downs, around southeast of Petersfield in Hampshire. It comprises the village of South Harting and the hamlets of East Harting, West Harting and Nyewood. The area of the parish is . At the 2011 Census, the population was 1,451, an increase from 1,407 at the 2001 Census. History Harting was listed in the Domesday Book (1086) under the ancient hundred of Dumpford as the large Manor of Hertinges, which included 196 households encompassing South, West and East Harting. They were 134 villagers, 42 smallholders and 20 slaves. With resources including ploughing lands, meadows, woodland and nine mills, it had a value to the lords of the manor of £100. The joint lords were the church of St Nicholas, Arundel, and Earl Roger of Shrewsbury. Apart from three generations of the Earls Montgomery the manor was in the possession of the Crown until 1610 when it was granted to the Caryll family. In 1746 the manor was purchased by the Featherstonhaugh family, in whose possession it remains.  Harting Down  The villages are overlooked by Harting Down, a common owned by the National Trust and part of the Sussex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Rising to , it offers panoramic views over the Weald to the north, to the English Channel and the Isle of Wight to the south. Archaeological evidence has suggested that Harting Down was first occupied around 5000 years ago. Neighbouring Beacon Hill is home to a hillfort from the Iron Age, built around 500 BC as an animal enclosure and refuge. In addition, a cross ridge dyke was built around the same time, may have been used to control movement of people and animals along the ridgeway.National Trust - Harting Down Because of its elevation Beacon Hill, just to the east of Harting Down, hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain, from 1796 to 1816, which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in Portsmouth and Plymouth. This was replaced in 1822 by a semaphore station which operated on a slightly different route until 1847. Bertrand Russell and his wife Dora founded the experimental Beacon Hill SchoolDavid Harley Beacon Hill School at Telegraph House, which was their residence in 1927.Kenneth Blackwell and Sheila Turcon Russell's Addresses West of Beacon Hill is Tower hill, on top of which is the Vandalian Tower, a folly dating to the 18th century which is in the grounds of Uppark house. It was built to celebrate the founding of the American colony of Vandalia in 1774, though the events of the American Revolution meant that the colony never got off the ground. The tower is in ruins and cannot be entered, but can be seen from outside. A large portion of the down has never been used for modern intensive farming and is thus an important site representing the chalk grassland that once covered the downs. Plants found on the site include quaking grass and the common spotted orchid. The down supports animals such as adders, skylarks and several species of butterfly. Governance An electoral ward of the same name covers this parish and the neighbouring parishes of Elsted and Treyford and Trotton with Chithurst. The ward's population at the 2011 Census was 2,026.

Publication history Justice Machine debuted in Noble Comics' Justice Machine #1 (June 1981), created by writer-penciler Michael Gustovich, with the first issue cover penciled by John Byrne and inked by Gustovich. This initial series lasted five issues, cover-dated Winter 1981, April 1982, Fall 1982, and Winter 1983. The first three issues were published in magazine format. An annual publication, Justice Machine Annual #1 (1983) was published by Texas Comics, and featured a crossover with the then-defunct Tower Comics' superhero team T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, by writer William Messner- Loebs (as Bill Loeb) and penciler Bill Reinhold. A second story, by writer- penciler Bill Willingham, introduced the superhero team the Elementals. This led to a miniseries, Justice Machine featuring the Elementals #1-4 (May-Aug. 1986), by writer Willingham and artist Gustovich, published by Comico. That company subsequently published an ongoing Justice Machine series (vol. 2) that lasted 29 issues (Jan. 1987 - May 1989), plus a 1989 annual. That series' initial creative team consisted of writer Tony Isabella and artist Gustovich. Innovation Comics published a three-issue miniseries, The New Justice Machine (Nov. 1989 - March 1990), by Mark Ellis with pencils by Darryl Banks and others, and inks by Gustovich. An accompanying one-shot, Justice Machine Summer Spectacular #1 (Summer 1990), by writer Messner-Loebs and penciler Reinhold, contained a story that had originally been created for publication by Texas Comics in 1983.Grand Comics Database: Justice Machine Summer Spectacular #1 This was followed by a new ongoing series, Justice Machine vol. 3, which ran seven issues (April 1990 - April 1991), as well as the one-shot Hero Alliance & Justice Machine: Identity Crisis #1 (September 1990), by writer Ellis, pencilers Banks and Rik Levins, and inker Gustovich. Initially produced by Ellis and Banks, the series acquired creator Gustovich as both penciler and inker for issues #4-6, and Isabella as writer for the final three issues. Ellis' Millennium Publications produced two issues of a fourth volume (Oct. & Dec. 1992), by writer Ellis and penciler Banks. These feature updated versions of the characters. Ellis had purchased the Justice Machine rights from Gustovich in 1991. This would be the last new appearance of the Justice Machine for over 20 years. The New Justice Machine: High Gear Edition, Volume One was released by Ellis' Millennial Concepts and Gary Reed's Transfuzion Publishing in March 2009. The compilation volume collected the New Justice Machine mini-series and the first issue of the regular series published by Innovation. Object of Power, an original Justice Machine graphic novel by Ellis and artists David Enebral and Ivan Barriga was published by Bluewater Productions in June 2014. The Justice Machine is currently owned by George Sarantopoulos.https://trademark.trademarkia.com/the-justice- machine-88569984.html Fictional team history In the first two versions of the team, the Justice Machine is an elite law enforcement agency from the planet Georwell, a parallel world with advanced technology that the Machine members believe is a utopia. Arriving on Earth in pursuit of Maxinor, a criminal and accused terrorist from their world, the team members soon discover that Georwell is much more fascist and dystopian than they had previously believed. Meanwhile, the Georwellian authorities have activated a second team, called 'the Guardians' in the Noble series, or the New Justice Machine in the Comico series. Zarren, their superior, has the Machine indicted as traitors and they have no choice but to remain on Earth. Zarren recognizes that Georwell's government is corrupt, but he has no desire to change the system; he merely wants to advance to a position of more power. The Machine's idealism might interfere with his own personal goals. Later, Zarren falls victim to his own schemes and must flee to Earth, where he sets himself up as the president of small South American island, the Arriba Atoll. \\"Georwell\\" is a play on George Orwell, the author of 1984, and the society of Georwell is based on the society of 1984, though much more technically advanced. In \\"The Chimera Conspiracy\\", scripted by Mark Ellis and Darryl Banks and published by Millennium Publications, it is revealed that Georwell is actually Earth in an alternate future, some 900 years hence. Rather than traveling from one dimension to another, the Justice Machine went sideways and backward in time, drawn to a temporal nexus point where the events which eventually create Georwell are in a state of flux. Characters The Justice Machine * Challenger (Jaiime Conrad) -- the leader, physically adept and a skilled strategist, effectively the Georwellian military version of Batman/Captain America. He is very conscious of his age and declining physical abilities, although Georwellians live considerably longer than Terrans. He makes extensive use of gadgets, most of which he invented himself, to augment his declining physical powers. * Blazer (Mitrian Fynn)--initially thought to be daughter of Light-Wave, the leader of an earlier version of the Justice Machine, and Masha Fynn, the Flame, a member of that earlier version of the Machine. Later it was revealed that she is actually Challenger's daughter. Experiments performed on her in the womb gave her greater powers than her mother, but she must wear a protective suit to prevent her thermal powers overloading and causing a fiery cataclysm. Later, a Terran scientist from New Atlantis implants devices in her nervous system that allow her to exert more control over her powers. * Titan (Jemin Osk)-- Mutant male, able to increase his height and mass to a maximum of 30 feet. * Demon (Gabel Nevin)-- highly trained (and egotistical) martial artist. Demon has an on-again, off-again addiction to the Georwellian drug Edge, which enhances a user's strength, speed, stamina, and ability to ignore pain but leaves the user virtually helpless when it wears off. * Diviner (Tessei Molleng A-Conrad)-- Challenger's (ex-)wife (but not Blazer's mother), at one time totally dependent on a body- suit for any of her senses, but consequently able to use those senses at paranormal levels. Able to interface with electronic and digital technology. * Talisman -- mutant with the power of karma: good things happen to him (and by extension to his teammates), bad things happen to his foes, so long as his cause is righteous. Career criminal, fraudster and gambler. Due to some unrevealed trauma, he becomes a clergyman. * Chain (Kristin \\"Krista\\" Clay) -- an African-American woman who gained psionic abilities which she channels through her light chainsaw. Introduced in the Innovation mini-series, she is the team's first earth-born member. Allies * Maxinor -- A rebel against the oppressive regime of Georwell. Initially an enemy of the Justice Machine, he and the Justice Machine eventually become allies. * Youthquake -- Maxinor's son. A mute youth with the power to control quakes. He falls in love with Blazer, and the two of them marry. Eventually, Blazer gives birth to their son. * Free Force -- Super-powered members of the New Atlantis security force, consisting of Havoc, Night Owl and Controller. * Ms. Liberty -- From Earth. A highly skilled athlete, performer and escape artist. * Jubal Woolcott --Founder of the Justice Institute, a private law university near Alexandria, Virginia. The Justice Machine takes up more or less permanent residence on the campus. Enemies The Guardians * Id -- a bodiless intellect which led the remaining members of the group. * Night Lightning -- mutant with the ability to generate and expel electrical energy. * Phaser -- mutant able to phase his body out of solidity. * Monolith -- Titan's jealous brother, able to grow slightly more but starting out with less intellect. * Crusader -- a slightly- less effective Challenger. * Manslaughter -- a man-hating, amazon-like warrior, armed with a ball-and-chain weapon. * Fist -- large muscle-bound ex- criminal, used for wetwork (killing) operations. Department Z * An organization of super-powered operatives who work for Zarren. The core group consists of The Directress (also known as Ms. Liberty), Skrapiron, Aquinox, Heavyhand and Ornithon. Independent Operators * Zarren -- Former Chief Prosecutor of Georwell and the Justice Machine's most implacable foe. Stripped of his rank after the failure of the Georwellian invasion. He wore an eyepatch during his initial introduction and appearances in the series, but after he was stripped of his rank his remaining eye was removed which may imply how he lost his first eye. He later made his way to Earth and eventually set himself up as the dictator of the small island nation of the Arriba Atoll. * Dark Force -- Dedicated to destruction of the Georwellian government, willing to work with the Machine to suit its needs. Revealed to be an armored suit used by a young girl (Tana Moshe) in the villain's first incarnation. Upon the entity's return in \\"The Chimera Conspiracy\\", Darkforce is obviously an entity of energy. Other media The Justice Machine was the subject of a sourcebook for the role-playing game Heroes Unlimited, published by Palladium Books. This version was based solely on the Noble comics version, but includes details of storylines and characters stretching beyond the comic-published material.

Preface to Brothers of Light, Brothers of Blood (Sunstone Press, 2007) p. xiii. Early life Born the first of ten children to Fabián Chávez and María Nicolasa Roybal de Chávez in Wagon Mound, New Mexico, Chavez was baptized with the name Manuel Ezequiel. He was a 12th-generation New Mexican, whose family had been in the area since the first Spanish settlement of 1598. In 1912, his family moved to San Diego, California, where his father worked for the Panama-California Exposition. The missions he was exposed to in California inspired him to follow in the footsteps of Junípero Serra and the other missionaries to the Native Americans. Education Returning to New Mexico, Chavez attended public schools in Mora, staffed by members of the Sisters of Loretto. In 1924, at the age of 14, Chavez was admitted to St. Francis Seminary in Mount Healthy, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. While at the seminary, Chavez endeavored to improve his English (his second language) through a study of the classic literature of the language. He began writing fiction, essays, and other works at this time, several of which were published in the Brown and White, the student magazine he later edited. As a member of the first class to inhabit the seminary's new dormitory, Chavez was allowed to paint murals of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Anthony of Padua on its walls. On August 15, 1929, Chavez was received in the novitiate of the Friars Minoas and received the Franciscan habit. Due to his promise as a visual artist, he was given the religious name Frater Angélico after the Florentine painter Fra Angelico. He continued his studies at Duns Scotus College in Detroit, graduating in 1933. He studied for four more years before being ordained in 1937 at Saint Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe, the first native New Mexican Franciscan priest. However, in April 1914, two young women from Nacimiento, New Mexico, Elsira Montoya and Dolores Lucero, first-cousins, entered the Franciscan order at St. Louis, Missouri. They spent the remaining 70 and 75 years of their lives as Franciscan nuns. Priesthood Chavez was assigned to the parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Peña Blanca and its missions in Jémez Pueblo and Los Cerrillos. At Peña Blanca, he undertook a revitalization of the church building, painting frescoes on its walls. He was his own model for the figure of Pontius Pilate, and also used locals and three of his sisters as figure models. He also ministered to the local Indians of San Felipe Pueblo, Santo Domingo Pueblo, and the Pueblo of Cochiti. During World War II, Chavez attended the chaplaincy school at Harvard University and was placed with the 77th Infantry Division. He was present for the beach landings of Guam and Leyte. He continued his military service during the Korean War as chaplain at Fort Bliss, Texas, and Kaiserslautern, Germany. Career Upon his return from the battlefield, Chavez was appointed archivist of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and undertook the cataloging and translation of its Spanish archives. This work provided new primary sources that allowed for a reevaluation of the history of New Mexico. He wrote the definitive work on the families of New Mexico, as well as many other works of history, some of which is considered revisionist. For example, his view of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, unorthodox in its minimization of the role of Popé and its emphasis on the mestizo element, was based primarily on previously-unconsidered genealogical data. Chavez' biography of Father Antonio José Martínez (1793–1867), But Time and Chance, was the first of a trilogy of biographies on significant native New Mexican priests. It is a scholarly and balanced treatment of the Cura de Taos whose life story had been distorted by some authors. In 1846, General Sephen W. Kearny swore Martinez as the first United States citizen of the Territory of New Mexico. Within six months, however, his political enemies wrongly alleged that Padre Martinez instigated the Taos Uprising of 1847—one of the last events of the US-Mexican War. Padre Martinez was very influential in New Mexico and beyond as a religious figure, rancher, educator, author and publisher, lawyer and politician. He was in conflict with his superior Bishop Lamy regarding the issue of tithing and other matters, and suffered ecclesiastical censure in 1858. When he died in 1867, his peers in the Territorial Assembly called him \\"La Honra de Su Pais,\\" the honor of his homeland. Among the general populace, Chavez is most known for the book entitled La Conquistadora, the Autobiography of an Ancient Statue. This work told the story, in a first person narrative, of a statue of the Virgin Mary brought from Spain over 400 years ago, through Mexico to New Mexico. The statue resides in St. Francis Cathedral to this day and is an important part of the religious history of the Spanish people of Northern New Mexico. Chavez also wrote short stories, novels, and poetry. His poem The Virgin of Port Lligat, based on Salvador Dalí's The Madonna of Port Lligat, was selected as one of the best books of 1959 by the Catholic Library Association and was praised by T. S. Eliot as a \\"very commendable achievement.\\"Genaro M. Padilla, \\"Introduction,\\" The Short Stories of Fray Angelico Chavez, U of New Mexico Press, p. viii. As Chavez scholar Genaro M. Padilla notes, \\"despite [his] outpouring of history, poetry, and fiction, Fray Angelico Chavez has been largely overlooked as one of the pioneers of Chicano [sic] literature in century\\".Padilla, \\"Introduction\\", p. x. In 1971, he left the priesthood following a \\"crisis of faith\\", but retained his standing as a priest while continuing his writing and research. He returned to the priesthood and the Franciscan Order in 1989 and lived at the friary at the Cathedral in Santa Fe. He died on March 18, 1996, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the age of 85. Chavez was buried in Rosario Cemetery, having earlier refused burial in St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe. The Museum of New Mexico at the Palace of the Governors named the new history and photographic library in his honor following his death, and a bronze statue of his likeness is displayed at the entrance.Harrelson, Barbara.

Retrieved on August 21, 2009. In August 2020, the statue along with the walls of the museum were defaced with spray paint. The walls were marked with the words \\"stolen land\\" and \\"1680,\\" an apparent reference to the Pueblo Revolt, an event chronicled by Chavez in what has been criticized as a revisionist interpretation.

The purpose was to enable the signals intelligence activities to continue in Sweden and to prevent the equipment falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. A Soviet invasion was considered likely and plans were made to support guerrilla warfare in Finland after a possible occupation. The operation had its base in the small fishing village of Nämpnäs in Närpes, Ostrobothnia, from where the archives were shipped to Swedish ports. The leaders of the operation were Colonel Aladár Paasonen, chief of Finnish military intelligence, and Colonel Reino Hallamaa, head of the Finnish signals intelligence section. Transportation to Sweden On 20September 1944 a large part of the Finnish signals intelligence unit was moved to Sweden. From the Swedish side Major Carl Petersén, head of the Defence Staff's intelligence section C-byrån, was responsible for the operation. Approximately 750 people were transported across the Gulf of Bothnia: by three ships from Närpes to Härnösand; and one ship from Uusikaupunki to Gävle. The ships also carried boxes of archives and signals intelligence equipment. After the Soviet Union was ceded parts of Karelia and Salla from Finland on 19September 1944, in accord with the Moscow Armistice, the majority of the Finnish personnel and their families returned home, except those hired by the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA). They crossed the border at the Torne River in secret. Sweden offered to take over the equipment and some of the documents. The FRA thus had access to technical equipment and seven boxes of files, which became important in the newly established activities of the FRA. Operation Stella Polaris led to Sweden gaining access to a large amount of high quality intelligence. It also learnt signals intelligence techniques from the Finnish personnel, some of whom the Swedes hired. For Finland, the operation resulted in domestic political entanglements as a result of the Finnish People's Democratic League's strong influence in government. These included action against several of those involved in the operation for so-called \\"anti-Soviet\\" activities, resulting in prison sentences. Processing in Sweden From October 1944 the intelligence material was moved to the basement of the Hotel Aston in Stockholm. There, the Finnish operations leader Reino Hallamaa microfilmed the material, which he sold to several countries' intelligence agencies. Later the material was removed by the FRA. Large parts of the material were then stored by Carl C:son Bonde at Hörningsholm Castle, and twenty-nine boxes by Svante Påhlson at Rottneros Manor from 20March 1945. Seven boxes of material had previously been submitted to the FRA. In the early 1960s, the secret documents from Operation Stella Polaris were burned at Lövsta garbage dump in Stockholm on the instruction of the then Director-General of FRA, Gustaf Tham, and the now- retired general Carl Ehrensvärd. The Finns involved in Operation Stella Polaris were persecuted and arrested after their return to Finland by the Communist-dominated State Police. It was not until the early 1950s that the Finnish Chancellor of Justice declared those who participated in Operation Stella Polaris would not be subject to war crimes proceedings. Later events In Nämpnäs there is a memorial to the operation. 15–20 Finnish signal technicians who travelled to Sweden in Operation Stella Polaris were immediately made Swedish citizens and remained as FRA employees in Sweden. The Finnish military intelligence chief Aladár Paasonen, who together with Reino Hallamaa had the main responsibility for the operation, worked with the American forces in Germany in the mid- '50s Personal knowledge. Neil P. Albaugh and later lived until the 1970s in the United States. Reino Hallamaa moved to Spain, where he started a construction company.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts at 6 kilowatts ERP from a tower on the northwest edge of Middletown. Its studios are in Poughkeepsie, New York. WRRV's programming is a simulcast on 96.9 WRRB Arlington, New York which serves the Mid-Hudson Valley and vicinity. Though on paper WRRV is seen as the primary station, in reality it is a two-frequency station. To an extent, WRRB is the dominant frequency based on total audience and sales (and the fact that, since 2000, the station has been run out of the longtime studios of sister WPDH on Pendell Road in Poughkeepsie). History to 1995 92.7 signed on the air in 1966 as WALL-FM, sister to WALL and originally ran easy listening, then simulcast the popular top 40 format of the AM side. WALL top 40 alumni include Howard Hoffman (now behind the scenes at KABC, most notable as WABC's last music jock), Dave Charity, Larry Berger (both future of WPLJ), and future game show announcer Randy West in his first on-air job and Jimmy Howes Around 1979, the WALL stations were sold to a group headed by New York City disc jockey Bruce Morrow (\\"Cousin Brucie\\"). The Middletown, New York Armory became “One Broadcast Plaza,” where Robert F.X. Sillerman and Morrow headquartered the Sillerman- Morrow Group, which purchased, operated and then sold radio and television stations around the country at a handsome profit. With Morrow making the programming decisions, 92.7 changed format to an adult contemporary/oldies hybrid as WKGL \\"92 Karat Gold\\". When the Morrow-led group left radio ownership in 1985 and sold WALL/WKGL to Bell Broadcasting, \\"92 Karat Gold\\" was replaced by \\"92rock7\\", a Top 40/Rock hybrid which leaned heavily on new rock and energetic air personalities around the clock. \\"92rock7\\" was well ahead of a late 1980s \\"Rock 40\\" radio industry trend and developed a cult following. Regardless of this following, Bell Broadcasting fell into financial difficulties from their Sillerman-financed mortgage and sold WKGL and WALL in 1988 to Orange & Rockland Utilities, the locally based gas and electric provider for much of the station's coverage area and today a unit of Con Edison. Orange & Rockland, eliminated the on air personalities at the station, in turn giving them a reason switch the station's format. By 1989, WKGL evolved into \\"The Orange\\" (with the new WKOJ calls) with a mainstream rock approach. WKOJ featured a rock format without hard rock or outrageous personalities. DJs were mostly limited to reading liner cards and did not talk over any music, production was sparse and the audience skewed toward women, not the traditional male AOR listener. By 1993, ratings had slipped, and WKOJ fell far behind rival WPDH - which prompted more changes. Orange & Rockland had relied heavily on an outside consultant from the beginning of their venture into broadcasting, as station General Managers reported to management in a non-regulated natural gas division. Faced with several underperforming properties, in mid-1993 the utility hired a successful and experienced broadcaster, Don Schwartz, to oversee its radio properties in New York, New Jersey, Maine and Illinois. With new management in place in 1994, WKOJ had updated its play list, secured the local rights to Woodstock '94, jettisoned most pre-1975 titles, added Joe Kelly as the station's voice, built a new morning team around Joe Thomas (imported from WRCN, Long Island) and production director Chris Rogers and became \\"Today's Best Rock.\\" The station’s new approach yielded an immediate ratings rebound and a strong showing in the 18-34 demographic. However, O&R; was anxious to leave radio ownership amid a management scandal at the parent company. Ownership deregulation brought lucrative offers to their doorstep. O&R; sold all of their radio holdings in 1995. Rather than compete with WKOJ, WPDH owner Rob Dyson's Crystal Radio Group bought WALL/WKOJ and positioned the FM station to take audience from K-104 and simultaneously protect WPDH from an active rock competitor.  1995 to present  On April 3, 1995 at 10:00 a.m., WKOJ's format gave way to \\"We Are The New Rock Revolution!\\" or as the new call letters WRRV for short, a format that is still in effect though with the new tagline \\"We're The New Rock Alternative!\\", Andrew Boris (who goes by his last name only on the radio) was WRRV's first DJ and hosted the morning show from the format change in 1995 until his retirement in early 2012, after which he was replaced by Deuce. His former co-host Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Coudrey died of sarcoma in June 2009. The station has set up the Jennifer Coudrey Scholarship Fund, which helps women pursuing careers in physical therapy. In the summer of 2013, Andrew stepped down as program director to focus on his new job as morning host at the legendary 101.5 WPDH. Andrew was replaced in November 2013 by longtime WRRV music director Billy Dunn. In March 2015, Dunn launched WRRV Sessions, a monthly live music series featuring a rotating cast of national acts like Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, Coheed and Cambria and others. Evolutions of WRRV's format  At the outset, WRRV's format actually included more classic rock than the station had featured in WKOJ's final year. WRRV's format was an unusual blend of new and classic rock, both heavy metal and new alternative rock. The station gave listeners conflicting signals, featuring Ozzy Osbourne in produced imaging pieces while playing Green Day and Blues Traveler in heavy rotation. In late 1995, “Music All Morning with Boris” took over the morning drive slot. By 1996, the station had dropped their incredible slogan \\"We Are The New Rock Revolution!\\" for their newest slogan \\"We're The Pure Rock Alternative!\\" as WRRV officially focused exclusively on new alternative rock and the station took off. In June 1997, Crystal bought the 96.9 frequency, which had simulcast WDST into Poughkeepsie, and began a simulcast of WRRV. In February 1999, WRRV made a quiet but sudden shift to a Modern AC-heavy approach; this move was the opposite of the leaning of other stations in the format in a harder direction akin to active rock. At the time, the move seemed curious, but many of the stations that moved in the harder direction ended up changing their format entirely. In time, the station evolved back to a more mainstream alternative sound. In comparison to the format as a whole, WRRV still leans slightly towards some modern pop. Since 1996, following an uneven first year, WRRV's ratings have been successful, regardless of approach, and it is among the higher rated of modern rock stations in the US. The station has been highly successful from a business perspective over that time as well. The station has withstood brief challenges from 96.1 The X in 1996 and from active rock-formatted 92.9 Rock from 2002 through 2004. As with the other Crystal stations, WRRV and WRRB were sold to Aurora Communications in October 2000 which, in turn, was bought out a year later by Cumulus Media. WRRV is notable in being only one of two stations (WKNY in Kingston the other) from the Aurora purchase to face no major changes by Cumulus. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WRRV) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.

He was in charge of the 2nd Regional Police Corps, and he was also part of Intelligence Battalion 601 of the Argentine Army since June 1974, before the beginning of the military dictatorship, in the last days of the presidency of Juan Perón. He was born in Acebal, Santa Fe. He was officially declared dead in 1986 but this is disputed, it has been widely claimed that he was still alive after this date. Disappearance Between 1976 and 1979, and already under the dictatorship of the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, Feced was the head of the Intelligence Service of the 2nd Corps, which doubled as an illegal detention center (the major one in the area, of a total of about 10). His office coordinated the repressive scheme in Rosario and its neighboring areas. People were kidnapped by squads and taken to the IS to be held and tortured. Feced is known to have taken part in the kidnappings, in torture sessions when the victim was for some reason interesting to him, and in the killings, which were often conducted in faraway locations and sometimes passed as fights between the police and armed terrorists. Two of Feced's foremost assistants in these crimes were José Rubén Lo Fiego and Mario Alfredo Marcote. The Intelligence Service is now a memorial site called Centro Popular de la Memoria (People's Memorial Center), preserved by an organization of victims' relatives. Initial investigations According to the extensive research conducted after the end of the Proceso, 720 people were \\"disappeared\\" in Santa Fe and 350 in Rosario. Feced, together with then-Commander of the 2nd Army Corps Leopoldo Galtieri, is considered responsible for most of them. Before the closing of the case against him, Feced was accused of 270 crimes against humanity. Though Rosario had comparatively a smaller amount of \\"disappeared\\" people than other metropolitan areas, the proportion of those kidnapped that were set free from the detention centers and camps is also smaller, and there were many more victims of torture and murder. The Supreme Council of the Armed Council started an investigation about Feced in 1983, and produced a large amount of documentation including lists of missing people, anonymous burials in a cemetery in Rosario, and tens of criminal collaborators. Feced's cover- up and alleged death This investigation took 3 years before it was passed on to the Federal Justice in Rosario. Feced was in theory to be in prison since the official opening of the case on January 31, 1984; later he was transferred by justice to the custody of the Military Hospital of Campo de Mayo (Buenos Aires). There he is claimed to have undergone heart surgery in 1985. At the time, though, he was in fact free in Formosa. These facts point to complicity and protection by many powerful interest (military, government officials, and some powerful businessmen such as Alberto Gollán). On July 21, 1986, Feced was officially declared dead by the Military Hospital. Many witnesses, survivors of the IS, claim to have seen Feced alive after that date. An admission book of the Ariston Hotel in Rosario, presented as evidence to the court by journalist Claudio de Luca, showed a signature with Feced's handwriting, dated July 29, 1988. Francisco Oyarzábal, brother of a murdered victim, reported that Feced had been seen alive in Paraguay. The investigation of the Intelligence Service case was archived in 1987 after the passing of the laws called Ley de Obediencia Debida (Law of Due Obedience) and Ley de Punto Final (Full Stop Law), during the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín, which restricted the accountability for human rights abuses to the highest levels of the military hierarchy (who had been already tried) and put an end to ongoing criminal investigations into the lower levels. On December 15, 1989, the Penal Federal Court of Rosario, without giving weight to the above inconsistencies, declared the case against Feced extinct (closed) due to his alleged death. The rest of the people involved in the crimes of the Intelligence Service were pardoned by decree of President Carlos Menem in 1989-1990\\\\. Del Frade's research Research conducted by journalist Carlos del Frade since 1999, and published in 2002, shows that Feced's last recorded domicile was in the city of Buenos Aires. Though he was supposedly ill and senile, one of his former neighbors, interviewed by del Frade, contradicts this impression. Within the San Antonio Cemetery in Formosa, in the area reserved for members of the Gendarmería, there is a grave with the name of Agustín Feced, and an announcement in the local newspaper La Mañana says that he was buried there the same day of his death, at 5:30 PM. The official records of the cemetery show only one person being buried there and then, and it is not Feced; but he does appear in an old notebook also found there. The unofficial record in the notebook was written by Ramón Giménez, Feced's son-in-law and then a top government official. Feced's coffin is sealed in the wall next to another one that dates from the mid-1990s, and almost 3 meters above the ground. According to the guardian of the cemetery, San Antonio did not have lifts for coffins \\"until a few years ago\\" (1999), and work hours are 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, so Feced could not have been buried like that \\"unless [somebody] brought three ladders and a lot of people to get [the coffin] up there.\\" Re-opening of the case The case against the officers of the Intelligence Division, including Feced and many of his collaborators, was re-opened by federal judge Omar Digerónimo on September 6, 2004, who ordered a number of arrests. José Lo Fiego, Mario Marcote and another former police officer, José Carlos Scortechini, surrendered themselves almost immediately, but denying all the accusations.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts on 97.3 MHz with 620 watts ERP from a tower between Wurtsboro and Monticello. Its studios are in Poughkeepsie, New York. WZAD's programming was a simulcast of sister station 94.3 WKXP Kingston, an arrangement that began in March 2006 and ended in February 2020. Prior to this, WZAD had simulcast the programming of another sister station, 97.7 WCZX Hyde Park. Since January 3, 2020, sister station, NOW 97.7 WCZX out of (Hyde Park) has been simulcasting WZAD's programming. History WZAD first signed on in 1990 as part of a wave of new FM stations in the wake of the FCC's passage of Docket 80-90 which loosened class/frequency restrictions. The station began its life as The Wizard a locally based open-format station allowing DJs to choose their own music, featuring everything from contemporary folk and rock to jazz and country, with an evening talk segment and new age, world and classical music on weekends. The station was sold in the early 1990s and immediately fired all its on-air staff and changed to a satellite-based oldies format that had a playlist spanning from the birth of rock until the mid-1980s. The station later hired new DJs for its morning and afternoon hours, but was otherwise automated outside of some syndicated programming on weekends. The oldies format would last until early 1996, when WZAD's second owner sold the station to the Poughkeepsie-based Crystal Radio Group. With this sale, Crystal saw an opportunity to strengthen its WCZX (Oldies 97-7), an oldies station in Poughkeepsie by upgrading its format and simulcasting the programming to cover most of the Hudson Valley. When Crystal took control of the stations, WCZX and WZAD were merged into one station, Oldies 97-7/Oldies 97-3, from Crystal's headquarters in Poughkeepsie with some of WZAD's local staff making the move. However, with the move came a historical reduction on WZAD's end given that all post-1975 music was stricken from the playlist given WCZX's heavy 1955–1969 musical base. The name would be modified to Oldies 97 in early 1999 to sound less unwieldy. WZAD (and the rest of the Crystal stations) would change ownership twice in the early 2000s, first being sold to Aurora Communications in October 2000 and then to Cumulus Media when that company purchased Aurora a year later. It was the second move that led to profound changes as new management came out as being against the Oldies format which led to the push of WCZX/WZAD to change format. In February 2002 WCZX/WZAD began a gradual evolution away from oldies. Initially, they added some 1980s music. By the Summer the pre-1964 oldies were nearly gone and they were known as \\"Oldies 97 The Hudson valley's Best Mix\\". By August 2002, the station began focusing on the 1970s and played music from 1964 to 1989. Labor Day weekend in 2002 saw the name change to Mix 97, which at that time was a 1960s to 1980s music format. Late in 2002, the station began adding 90's music as well as recent hits and would evolve into an Adult Contemporary format in 2003. They would spend 2004 evolving away from its gold base. By 2005, the WZAD end of the simulcast was losing local listenership and advertising to locally-based WVOS-FM and its adult contemporary format. At the same time, Cumulus was looking to shore up the ratings of WKXP, a poorly rated country station with coverage problems. Prior to the start of the Spring ratings in March 2006, Cumulus changed WZAD's simulcast from WCZX to WKXP in response to saving WKXP's format and to retaliate against locally based WDNB launching a country format. The first ratings book for the two stations saw a slight improvement though both stations lag considerably behind longtime leader WRWD. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WZAD) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management.

It generates the storage size of an expression or a data type, measured in the number of char-sized units. Consequently, the construct sizeof (char) is guaranteed to be 1. The actual number of bits of type char is specified by the preprocessor macro , defined in the standard include file limits.h. On most modern computing platforms this is eight bits. The result of sizeof has an unsigned integral type that is usually denoted by size_t. The operator has a single operand, which is either an expression or a data type cast. A cast is a data type enclosed in parenthesis. Data types may not only be primitive types, such as integer and floating-point types, but also pointer types, and compound datatypes (unions, structs, and C++ classes). Purpose Many programs must know the storage size of a particular datatype. Though for any given implementation of C or C++ the size of a particular datatype is constant, the sizes of even primitive types in C and C++ may be defined differently for different platforms of implementation. For example, runtime allocation of array space may use the following code, in which the sizeof operator is applied to the cast of the type int: int *pointer = malloc(10 * sizeof (int)); In this example, function malloc allocates memory and returns a pointer to the memory block. The size of the block allocated is equal to the number of bytes for a single object of type int multiplied by 10, providing space for ten integers. It is generally not safe to assume the size of any datatype. For example, even though most implementations of C and C++ on 32-bit systems define type int to be four octets, this size may change when code is ported to a different system, breaking the code. The exception to this is the data type char, which always has the size 1 in any standards-compliant C implementation. In addition, it is frequently difficult to predict the sizes of compound datatypes such as a struct or union, due to padding. The use of sizeof enhances readability, since it avoids unnamed numeric constants (magic numbers). An equivalent syntax for allocating the same array space results from using the dereferenced form of the pointer to the storage address, this time applied the operator to a pointer variable: int *pointer = malloc(10 * sizeof *pointer); Use The operator sizeof produces the required memory storage space of its operand when the code is compiled. The operand is written following the keyword sizeof and may be the symbol of a storage space, e.g., a variable, an expression, or a type cast. The latter is a type name enclosed in parentheses. The result of the operator is the size of the operand in bytes, or the size of the memory storage requirement. For expressions, it evaluates to the representation size for the type that would result from evaluation of the expression, which is not performed. For example, since sizeof (char) is defined to be 1 and assuming the integer type is four bytes long, the following code fragment prints : char c; printf(\\"%zu,%zu \\", sizeof c, sizeof (int)); Certain standard header files, such as stddef.h, define size_t to denote the unsigned integral type of the result of a sizeof expression. The printf width specifier z is intended to format that type. sizeof cannot be used in C preprocessor expressions, such as , because it is an element of the programming language, not of the preprocessor syntax, which has no data types. The example below in C++ shows use of sizeof... operator with variadic templates. template std::size_t GetSize (Args&&... args) { /* Get size of parameter pack.*/ std::size_t Count= sizeof...(Args); return Count; } sizeof... can be used with variadic templates in C++11 and above on a parameter pack to determine number of arguments. Application to arrays When sizeof is applied to the name of an array, the result is the number of bytes required to store the entire array. This is one of the few exceptions to the rule that the name of an array is converted to a pointer to the first element of the array, and is possible just because the actual array size is fixed and known at compile time, when the sizeof operator is evaluated. The following program uses sizeof to determine the size of a declared array, avoiding a buffer overflow when copying characters: #include #include int main(int argc, char **argv) { char buffer[10]; /* Array of 10 chars */ /* Copy at most 9 characters from argv[1] into buffer. */ strncpy(buffer, argv[1], sizeof buffer - 1); /* Ensure that the buffer is null-terminated: */ buffer[sizeof buffer - 1] = '\\\\0'; return 0; } Here, is equivalent to , which evaluates to 10, because the size of the type char is defined as 1. C99 adds support for flexible array members to structures. This form of array declaration is allowed as the last element in structures only, and differs from normal arrays in that no length is specified to the compiler. For a structure named s containing a flexible array member named a, is therefore equivalent to : #include struct flexarray { char val; int array[]; /* Flexible array member; must be last element of struct */ }; int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf(\\"sizeof (struct flexarray)  %zu \\", sizeof (struct flexarray)); return 0; } In this case the sizeof operator returns the size of the structure, including any padding, but without any storage allowed for the array. Most platforms produce the following output: : C99 also allows variable length arrays that have the length specified at runtime, although the feature is considered an optional implementation in later versions of the C standard. In such cases, the sizeof operator is evaluated in part at runtime to determine the storage occupied by the array. #include size_t flexsize(int n) { char b[n+3]; /* Variable length array */ return sizeof b; /* Execution time sizeof */ } int main(void) { size_t size = flexsize(10); /* flexsize returns 13 */ return 0; } sizeof can be used to determine the number of elements in an array, by dividing the size of the entire array by the size of a single element: int main(void) { int tab[10]; printf(\\"Number of elements in the array: %zu \\", sizeof tab / sizeof tab[0]); /* yields 10 */ return 0; } Incomplete types  sizeof can only be applied to \\"completely\\" defined types. With arrays, this means that the dimensions of the array must be present in its declaration, and that the type of the elements must be completely defined. For structs and unions, this means that there must be a member list of completely defined types. For example, consider the following two source files: /* file1.c */ int arr[10]; struct x {int one; int two;}; /* more code */ /* file2.c */ extern int arr[]; struct x; /* more code */ Both files are perfectly legal C, and code in can apply sizeof to arr and . However, it is illegal for code in to do this, because the definitions in are not complete. In the case of arr, the code does not specify the dimension of the array; without this information, the compiler has no way of knowing how many elements are in the array, and cannot calculate the array's overall size. Likewise, the compiler cannot calculate the size of because it does not know what members it is made up of, and therefore cannot calculate the sum of the sizes of the structure's members (and padding). If the programmer provided the size of the array in its declaration in , or completed the definition of by supplying a member list, this would allow the application of sizeof to arr or in that source file.  Object members  C++11 introduced the possibility to apply the sizeof parameter to specific members of a class without the necessity to instantiate the object to achieve this.http://www.open- std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2253.html The following example for instance yields and on most platforms. #include struct foo { int a; int b; }; int main() { std::cout << sizeof foo::a << \\" \\" << sizeof(foo) << \\" \\"; } Variadic template packs C++11 introduced variadic templates; the keyword sizeof followed by ellipsis returns the number of elements in a parameter pack. template void print_size(Args... args) { std::cout << sizeof...(args) << \\" \\"; } int main() { print_size(); // outputs 0 print_size(\\"Is the answer\\", 42, true); // outputs 3 } Implementation When applied to a fixed-length datatype or variable, expressions with the operator sizeof are evaluated during program compilation; they are replaced by constant result-values. The C99 standard introduced variable-length arrays (VLAs), which required evaluation for such expressions during program execution. In many cases, the implementation specifics may be documented in an application binary interface (ABI) document for the platform, specifying formats, padding, and alignment for the data types, to which the compiler must conform. Structure padding When calculating the size of any object type, the compiler must take into account any required data structure alignment to meet efficiency or architectural constraints. Many computer architectures do not support multiple-byte access starting at any byte address that is not a multiple of the word size, and even when the architecture allows it, usually the processor can fetch a word-aligned object faster than it can fetch an object that straddles multiple words in memory. Therefore, compilers usually align data structures to at least a word boundary, and also align individual members to their respective boundaries. In the following example, the structure student is likely to be aligned on a word boundary, which is also where the member grade begins, and the member age is likely to start at the next word address. The compiler accomplishes the latter by inserting padding bytes between members as needed to satisfy the alignment requirements. There may also be padding at the end of a structure to ensure proper alignment in case the structure is used as an element of an array. Thus, the aggregate size of a structure in C can be greater than the sum of the sizes of its individual members. For example, on many systems the following code prints : struct student { char grade; /* char is 1 byte long */ int age; /* int is 4 bytes long */ }; printf(\\"%zu\\", sizeof (struct student));  See also  *typeof *offsetof  References  Category:C (programming language) Category:C++ Category:Articles with example C code Category:Operators (programming) Category:Unary operations ","title":"Sizeof"},{"id":"4487957","text":"Tiruchengode () is a city and selection grade municipality located in southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is famous for the ancient hilltop temple of Umaiorubagan (Arthanāreeshwara), dedicated to the unique combined male-female form of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi (see Ardhanarishwara). This important place of pilgrimage is mentioned in the Tamil work Silapathikaram as 'Neduvelkundru' and is celebrated in the hymns of Saivite saints. The equally famous Chenkottu Velavar Temple, dedicated to Lord Murugan, is situated on the same hill. As of 2011, the town had a population of 95,335. As per 2011 population, Tiruchengode is the largest city in Namakkal district. It is also famous for rig business. History This Tiruchengode was separated from Salem district several years before. In ancient days, Tiruchengode was known as Thirukodimaadachenkundrur – one of the historic places in Tamil Nadu. Tiruchengode was formed on 22 November and that day is celebrated as 'Tiruchengode day'. It was also known as Thiruchengottankudi Nageswaram. It enshrines the Ardhanareeswarar (man-woman) manifestation of Shiva, representing the unity of Shiva and Parvati, is enshrined in this revered hill temple of great significance, accessible by a motorable road; this is an ancient temple mentioned in the Tamil work, Silappadikaram as Neduvelkunru. The red color of the hill is the reason that it was called Chengode. The image above shows the view of the surrounding area from the top of the Tiruchengode hill. This temple is regarded as the 4th of the 7 Tevara Stalams in the Kongu Region of Tamil Nadu. * It is believed that Kannagi (Silappathikaram), after demolishing the city of Madurai by fire is called to Sorgam (Heaven) by her husband Kovalan and is in a wrath at the peak of the Tiruchengode hill. It is believed that they both took off in a flying vehicle to heaven. * The modern history of Tiruchengode includes many memorable events. Eminent leaders like Rajaji, EVR Periar, T.S. Pattabiraman, T.M.Kaliyannan Gounder and EVK Sampath are bound to this town. * Tiruchengode has the pride of having the country's first Gandhi Ashram, a tribute to India's great leader Mahatma Gandhi and opened by country's then viceroy Rajaji (C.Rajagopalachari).

The major industries here are Rig Spares, Power Looms and Textile Industries, Bus and Lorry Body Building, Lathe Industry, Rice Mills, Granite Factory, etc. Tiruchengode is well known for its Rig (Borewell) Lorries. Tiruchengode can be called \\"The Borewell Hub of India\\" as it manufactures the largest number of Borewell Vehicles operated in India. Nearly more than half of borewells operating across India are from Tiruchengode. Demographics According to 2011 census, Tiruchengode had a population of 95,335 with a sex-ratio of 994 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 8,901 were under the age of six, constituting 4,495 males and 4,406 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 11.36% and 0.07% of the population respectively. The average literacy of the town was 75.87%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The town had a total of 26,508 households. There were a total of 42,405 workers, comprising 329 cultivators, 686 main agricultural labourers, 1,279 in house hold industries, 38,804 other workers, 1,307 marginal workers, 7 marginal cultivators, 46 marginal agricultural labourers, 80 marginal workers in household industries and 1,174 other marginal workers.

District profile View of the city from Tiruchengode Tirumalai * This city has various other names like Nagasalam, Panimalai, Kodhai Malai, Aravakiri, Vayu Malai, Kongumalai, Nagagiri, Vandhimalai, Siddharmalai, Didya and still more. * It is a part of Kongu Nadu region of Tamil Nadu. Kongu Nadu includes in it 24 villages, out of which Poondhurai, a suburb of Erode city is one of the important pilgrimage centre. West of Cauvery is Melakarai Pundhurai and East of Cauvery is Kilakarai Pundhurai. Kilakarai Pundhurai is famously known as Thiruchengodu. * The word \\"Thiruchengodu\\" means beautiful, steeped hill in Tamil Language. * Thiruchengodu is famous for its reference in 'Kandhar Anuboothi' sung by Arunagirinathar for Lord Murugan -as \\"Nagasala velava nalu kavi\\". * Tiruchengodu is famous for its hill and the temple on the top. * Ancient and historical Thiruchengodu is crowned with Mummurthies named Arthanareeshwarar, Chengodu Velan and Athikesava Perumal. * The average annual rainfall is around 950 mm. The altitude is about 150–200 metres asl. * Around Tiruchengode many schools and colleges are there.

It was developed by Geoff Smith, a composer and musician from Brighton, England. Fluid tuning is accomplished by the addition of the microtonal tuning mechanism to the instrument. This mechanism enables the musician to alter each note individually and separately by precise microtonal intervals. With this design modification, the musician can choose either to leave the piano in 'fixed tuning', or to use the mechanism to retune any number of notes microtonally to any desired combination. The modification, therefore, allows a number of tuning layouts to be created and explored per composition, in contrast to the instrument being creatively limited to fixed tuning which is typically the culturally predominant Western chromatic octave. The microtonal tuning mechanism consists of a sliding bridge, a groove and buffers fitted to each note of the instrument. The bridge is in constant contact with the strings. If the musician slides the bridge along the groove to any point between the buffers, a precise microtonal interval change results.

Forest IPM practices vary from region to region and particularly by state, according to the habitat and forests present. Forest integrated pest management or Forest IPM combines cultural, biological and chemical technologies to reduce pest damage to levels below those that of economic damage. Forest IPM is utilized for the whole life of the tree, from site prep to harvest. An IPM treatment is utilized before the cost of the treatment is equal to the reduction in crop value due to past injury, which is called the economic injury level. Forest integrated pest management has a strong emphasis on intensive forest management. The main components of forest integrated pest management are how pest populations change over time, forest stand susceptibility and resistance to pests, pest impact on crop value, and control strategies. Forest IPM is designed to provide the information needed to deal with multiple pest problems in a way that promotes forest management objectives. In the state of Vermont, two common pests are of particular significance, the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid or HWA, and thrips.  Practices of IPM   Preventive  Preventive practices of forest integrated pest management include training, detection, diagnosis and evaluation and exclusion. These are actions that can be done to prevent pest infestations from reaching levels of concern. Training employees to find early signs of pest occurrence will help landowners find and remove infected trees before the infestation spreads. Cleaning equipment before moving to different stands and when first brought onto the property will remove any contaminates that could affect the forest.  Cultural  Intensive forest management can be described as the cultural practices in forest integrated pest management. Cultural practices are done during the growth of the crop trees and also in the form of site prep and harvest practices. These practices range from choosing a good site with adequate drainage to the having an appropriate tree per acer (TPA). Seedling density is very important in tree nurseries. Having seedlings with a too high density promotes foliage disease fungi since airflow is reduced. The seedlings will also have more competition between themselves with a higher density, and this will reduce the quality of each seedling. The recommended density for longleaf pine is 50–90 per square meter and loblolly and slash pine at less than 215 seedlings per square meter.  Biological  The act of releasing native or nonnative predators of pest species is uncommon in forest integrated pest management. It would not be economically feasible to utilize this method in a forestry scenario. Instead, the forest and its surrounding area is managed in a way to promote natural enemies of pest species. In a study of eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, the closer the plantation is to a \\"natural\\" more diverse forest, the more diverse and balanced the insect populations are. This more diverse environment is less likely for produce an outbreak of pest species. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that is used to kill larvae of many pest species. This can be applied aerially or on the ground over large surfaces. Bt is safe for humans and other wildlife since it only infects certain species of insects.  Chemical  Integrated pest management was designed after Rachael Carson's Silent Spring as a way to manage for pests without overusing pesticides. Chemicals are still used but in a way that focuses on proper use of pesticide application so overuse does not occur. The fungicide triadimefon is applied to loblolly and slash pine seeds to prevent fusiform rust. If the seeds used are not treated for fusiform rust, the stand can lose 1–30% of their trees to the rust. Longleaf pine is naturally resistant to fusiform rust so their seeds are not treated with triadimefon. Southern pine nurseries fumigate the soil every four years and hardwood nurseries fumigate yearly. Fumigation promotes growth of beneficial fungus Trichoderma and less of the harmful Phythium fungus. In forest integrated pest management, insecticides are not applied until an infestation is observed. Herbicides are used to control weeds in nurseries. Low rates and frequent application intervals of herbicide is what is recommended.  Eucalyptus plantations  Eucalyptus plantations provide a unique management challenge since they are commonly grown out of their native range and also in monocultures of clones. Large homogeneous areas of one species of tree are more susceptible of pest attacks. This is due to an abundant and predictable amount of food for the pest, and an absence of their natural enemies. There are less predator species in monocultures because the plants they need to forage, rest and lay eggs on are not there. This combination is why monoculture environments favor certain species and amplify their numbers to pest levels. The biggest pest concern with eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, for example, are leaf-cutting ants and Lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) defoliators. Leaf-cutting ants contribute the most damage to these plantations. The insecticide methyl bromide is needed to fight leaf- cutting ants, with application done within a month of planting. Periodic applications during the rest of the rotation may be necessary. Monitoring leaf-cutting ant activity is crucial in eucalyptus plantations. Keeping a vegetative understory can also lower leaf-cutting ant numbers. Lepidoptera larva can be controlled with Bt application. Using a tractor is a more efficient than aerially applying Bt since the canopy is so closed and the Bt needs to reach the ground where the larva are. Traps are used to monitor larva levels to help better manage for them.

In Bichitra Natak, Guru Gobind Singh praised the heroism of Daya Ram in the Battle of Bhangani, and equated him to Dronacharya of Mahabharata.Bichitra Natak. Chapter 8, Chaupai 6  Biography  Singh was born in a Sobti Khatri family of Sialkot to father Bhai Suddha and mother Mai Diali. Bhai Suddhi was a devout Sikh of Guru Tegh Bahadur and had visited Anandpur more than once to seek his blessing. In 1677, he travelled to Anandpur along with his family including his young son, Daya Ram, to make obeisance to Guru Gobind Singh, this time to settle there permanently. Daya Ram, already well versed in Punjabi and Persian, engaged himself in the study of classics and gurbani. He also received training in the use of weapons. In the historic divan (gathering) in the Keshgarh Fort at Anandpur on 30 March 1699, Daya Ram was the first to rise at the Guru's call and offer his head, followed by four others in succession. These five were the first to be admitted to the fold of the Khalsa and they in turn administered the rites of initiation to Guru Gobind Singh who called them collectively Panj Pyare - The Five Beloved Ones. Daya Ram after initiation became Daya Singh. Although the five enjoyed equal status as the Guru's close confidants and constant attendants, Singh was always regarded as the first among equals. He took part in the battles of Anandpur, and was one of the three Sikhs who followed Guru Gobind Singh out of Chamkaur on the night of 7/8 December 1705, eluding the besieging hordes. He was Guru Gobind Singh's emissary sent from the village of Dina in the Punjab to deliver his letter which became famous as Zafarnamah, the Letter of Victory, to Emperor Aurangzeb, then camping at Ahmadnagar. Bhai Daya Singh, accompanied by Bhai Dharam Singh (another of the Panj Pyare) reached Ahmadnagar via Aurangabad, but found that it was not possible to personally deliver the letter to the Emperor as Guru Gobind Singh had directed. Daya Singh sent Dharam Singh back to seek the Guru's advice, but before the latter could rejoin him with fresh instructions, he had managed to have the letter delivered, and had himself returned to Aurangabad. \\"Gurudwara Bhai Daya Singh, Ahmednagar\\" marks the place of Jafarnama at Ahmednagar. A shrine called Gurdwara Bhai Daya Singh marks the place of his sojourn in Dhami Mahalla. Bhai Daya Singh and Bhai Dharam Singh returned and, according to Sikh tradition, they rejoined Guru Gobind Singh at Kalayat, a town 52 km southwest of Bikaner (28° 4'N, 73° 21 'E) in Rajasthan. Bhai Daya Singh remained in attendance upon the Guru and was with him at the time of his death at Nanded on 7 October 1708. Bhai Daya Singh died at Nanded soon afterwards. A joint memorial stands at Nanded to preserve the memory of Bhai Daya Singh and Bhai Dharam Singh, who also died there. Known as Angitha (literally burning pyre), it marks the site of their cremation. Bhai Daya Singh was a learned man. One of the Rahitnamas (manuals on Sikh conduct) is ascribed to him. The Nirmalas, a sect of Sikh ascetics, claim him as one of their forebears. Their Darauli branch traces its origin to Bhai Daya Singh through Baba Deep Singh.

Overview  MS-Test was developed for internal use in Microsoft but became a commercial product at the beginning of 1992. MS-Test automated the process of testing Windows applications. It combined a Windows development language, Basic, with a testing-oriented API. Tests known as scripts were written in Test Basic, a form of the BASIC programming language. The API was predominantly wrapped around Windows API functions. Test scripts could be created with capture/replay, in particular by the Windows Recorder tool. However its dominant strength was that scripts could be coded and compiled. Either an individual script could be run, or a group of them run in sequence by a test driver. Among the innovations for the test driver was the ability to customize the batch execution with the inclusion of custom-designed dialog boxes and menus, which were built with the User Interface Editor. Customers had to purchase Visual Test to develop scripts, but it offered free and unlimited redistribution of compiled scripts. The ability to use OLE Automation allowed enterprising individuals to expand beyond basic functional testing into load testing. A script could create tens of browsers, drive them, feed them with data, collect statistics and monitor the state of the test.  Capabilities  New capabilities were added over time. In 1992, new DLLs were added to provide support for testing: # DOS VM # Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) # The ability to run scripts remotely on other PCs of a local LAN # An enhanced test driver Included with Visual Test was a suite of samples that demonstrated the range of capabilities of the product. # Play the minesweeper game on its own. # Play solitaire # Sample screen saver and others  32-bit enhancements  Version 2.0 in 1993 had provided support for Windows 3.1. In 1994 MS-Test version 3.0 advanced from 16-bit systems to 32-bit. With Version 4.0 in 1995, it was hosted within Visual Studio and renamed to Visual Test. It was able to support the testing of the new application control that arrived with Windows 95 and NT. The other development language, Visual Basic, remained hosted within its own separate development environment. With its inclusion in Visual Studio, versioning of scripts could be maintained with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, also part of Studio. In version 4.0, the ability to access its capabilities from Visual Basic and C++, lost with 3.0, was regained. As 4.0r was being released, Rational Software Corporation negotiated its purchase from Microsoft in 1996.http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/oct96/ratvtstpr.mspx Version 6 (5 was skipped) from Rational incorporated support Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), support for HTML and Web pages and ability to read and change the Windows Registry. Version 6 provided support for Windows 98 and NT 5.0, which eventually became Windows 2000. Mainsoft Corporation created a ported version called MainWin Visual Test 4.0r for Unix. This version is for testing Unix applications created from Windows applications using Mainsoft MainWin platform. Rational Visual Test 6 was also sold as part of Rational DevelopmentStudio bundle. Visual Test was integrated with other Rational products: Purify, and Quantify, PureCoverage and ClearCase. Rational remained committed to fully support Visual Test through 2002. The last version shipped was 6.5. As of 2006, 103 tech notes that were provided as part of the support from Rational remained available from IBM, which previously acquired Rational (Search results).

With lacewing (Chrysopidae egg) closeup The hemlock woolly adelgid (; Adelges tsugae), or HWA, is an insect of the order Hemiptera (true bugs) native to East Asia. It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees (Tsuga spp.; Picea spp.). In its native range, HWA is not a serious pest because populations are managed by natural predators and parasitoids and by host resistance. In eastern North America it is a destructive pest that threatens the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and the Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana). HWA is also found in western North America, where it has likely been present for thousands of years. In western North America, it primarily attacks western hemlock Tsuga heterophylla and has only caused minor damage due to natural predators and host resistance. Accidentally introduced to North America from Japan, HWA was first found in the eastern United States near Richmond, Virginia, in 1951. The pest is now found from northern Georgia to coastal Maine and southwestern Nova Scotia. As of 2015, 90% of the geographic range of eastern hemlock in North America has been affected by HWA. Characteristics An adult individual body length is typically 0.8 mm, and is oval in shape. The tiny brown-colored insect has four thread-like stylets that are bundled together and function as a mouthpart. Three times the length of its body, the stylet bundle pierces the host plant's parenchymatic ray tissue to derive nutrition from stored reserves. It may also inject a toxin while feeding.McClure M.S. and Cheah, C.A. (2002) \\"Important Mortality Factors in the Life Cycle of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Homoptera: Adelgidae) in the Northeastern United States.\\" The resulting desiccation causes the tree to lose needles and not produce new growth. Hemlocks stricken by HWA frequently become grayish- green rather than a healthy dark green. In the northern portion of the hemlock's range, death typically occurs 4 to 10 years after infestation. Trees that survive the direct effects of the infection are usually weakened and may die from secondary causes. The presence of HWA can be identified by its egg sacs, which resemble small tufts of cotton clinging to the underside of hemlock branches. In North America, the hemlock woolly adelgid asexually reproduces and can have two generations per year. Both generations are parthenogenetic and exclusively female. In its native Asian habitat, a third winged generation called sexupera occurs; although this generation's sexual reproduction requires a species of spruce not found in the Eastern United States, and therefore dies, Between 100 and 300 eggs are laid by each individual in the woolly egg sacs beneath the branches. Larvae emerge in spring and can spread on their own or with the assistance of wind, birds, or mammals. In the nymph stage, the adelgid is immobile and settles on a single tree. Control methods Forest level The current leading biological control method of hemlock woolly adelgid is Sasajiscymnus tsugae, [originally called Pseudoscymnus tsugae]. S. tsugae is a black lady beetle that is relatively host-specific, feeding only on three known aldegid species, including HWA. This beetle was discovered in 1992 while feeding on hemlock woolly adelgid in its natural range of Japan. Since 1995, the DCNR's Bureau of Forestry has released hundreds of thousands of adult S. tsugae beetles into affected hemlock forests of the eastern United States to determine its effectiveness at controlling the spread of the adelgid. From 1995 to 1997, experiments in Connecticut and Virginia found that releasing adult Sasajiscymnus tsugae beetles into infested hemlock stands resulted in a 47 to 88% reduction in adelgid densities within 5 months of introduction. The beetle's lifecycle is in parallel to the lifecycle of the hemlock woolly adelgid. Both lay eggs in the spring and hatching occurs nearly simultaneously. When hatched, S. tsugae larvae are highly mobile and feed on hemlock woolly adelgid eggs and larvae. Each S. tsugae larva can effectively consume about 500 adelgid eggs or nearly 100 developing adelgid nymphs. Laricobius nigrinus is another predatory beetle used as a biological control in response to hemlock woolly adelgid. Native to the western United States and Canada, L. nigrinus is known to prey exclusively on various woolly adelgids. L. nigrinus adults lay their eggs on top of wintering adelgid larvae in early spring, and upon hatching, the larval beetles feed on hemlock woolly adelgid. Also under study is Laricobius osakensis from Japan, a relative of L. nigrinus. They have shown promise in field trials. Individual trees The environmentally safest chemical control methods for treating individual trees are nontoxic insecticidal soap and horticultural oil. These are sprayed on the foliage and smother the insects as they dry. Most trees need to be treated on a yearly basis. Toxic systemic insecticides may be applied to the foliage and bark of a tree and can persist in killing the adelgid for up to four years after application. Caution must be used, and restraint exercised around bodies of water. Soil drenches/soil injections/bark sprays are used in larger trees that cannot be completely sprayed with insecticidal soaps or foliage insecticides. Tree roots absorb and transport the product into the foliage and kill hemlock woolly adelgid. Soil drenches must be applied when soil moisture is adequate for the tree roots to absorb the product. These products should not be used in close proximity to bodies of water. Trunk injections are used for large trees that are near water or where soils are too rocky for soil injections or drenches. The chemical is injected directly into the tree and transported to the twigs and needles where the hemlock woolly adelgids are feeding. Adequate soil moisture is also necessary for the tree to take up these products. Significance Hemlock is a vital component of the New England forest system, and is the third-most prevalent tree in Vermont. It provides protection from erosion along stream banks, food for deer and wildlife, and shelter for deer in winter. The tree is also valued both as an ornamental and as an important source of lumber. Unlike the balsam woolly adelgid that attacked only mature balsam fir, HWA infests hemlocks of all ages. Where hemlocks occur in pure stands in that region, the most commonly observed tree species to succeed it is black (sweet) birch. In the southern extreme of its range, hemlock typically occurs not in pure stands, but in linear riparian areas and other moist sites. Succession in these areas is affected by the presence of Rhododendron maximum, which often coexists with hemlock, and because of a combination of influences restricts regeneration to shade and otherwise understory-tolerant plant species. Major changes in ecosystem structure and function, including hydrologic processes, are expected with the loss of hemlock. Loss of the eastern and Carolina hemlock from hemlock woolly adelgid infestation will likely result in many ecological shifts in eastern North America. The understory of hemlock forests is characterized as dark, damp, and cool and is an ideal habitat for various other organisms. The moist environment is preferred by many native amphibian species, particularly newts and salamanders. Some species of birds have close association with the hemlock, especially during mating and nesting periods. Aquatic systems adjunct to hemlock stands are also affected by the trees' decline. Brook trout is a native fish species to the eastern United States and is known to prefer the cool, shaded streams of hemlock forests during spawning events. Vulnerable animal populations are expected to diminish as a result of loss of hemlock habitat to the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid. One factor giving hope is that the adelgid does not seem able to survive prolonged or bitter cold. Following the winter of 1999-2000, a considerable dieback of adelgids and subsequent regrowth of infested trees was observed across Connecticut. The same phenomenon was repeated after the prolonged winter of 2013-2014, in time to save numerous nearly succumbed forests. A 2009 study conducted by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station suggests the hemlock woolly adelgid is killing hemlock trees faster than expected in the southern Appalachians, and rapidly altering the carbon cycle of these forests. According to Science Daily, the pest could kill most of the region's hemlock trees within the next decade. According to the study, researchers found \\"hemlock woolly adelgid infestation is rapidly impacting the carbon cycle in [hemlock] tree stands\\", and \\"adelgid-infested hemlock trees in the South are declining much faster than the reported 9-year decline of some infested hemlock trees in the Northeast.\\" In fact, as of 2007, the rate of HWA expansion was recorded as 15.6 km/year south of Pennsylvania and 8.13 km/year (or less) in the northern section of the HWA's range.

A prototype was first shown at the October 1993 Tokyo Auto show. It was offered with three different inline- four engines: from the original 1.5-liter GA15DE, to a larger 1.8-liter SR18DE, and finally a 2.0-liter SR20DE in the Rasheen Forza. The car has five seats and a rugged, quirky and angularly styled body. It is a very small and short four-wheel drive that is often compared to Eastern European cars in design, particularly the Wartburg 353, but is also reminiscent of Nissan's \\"Pike\\" cars (Be-1, Pao, Figaro, and S-Cargo). As for the Be-1 and Figaro, Rasheen production was carried out by contract manufacturer Takada Kogyo. It was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealership network called Nissan Red Stage. The Rasheen shared its platform with the Nissan Sunny (B14), including adopting the chassis NB14. Rasheen also used powertrain components from the Nissan Pulsar (N14) with four-wheel drive.

It ran from Abingdon in Washington County, Virginia to Todd in Ashe County, North Carolina. The line charted a complicated course through the mountains of the area, crossing the Blue Ridge not far from Mount Rogers. History Construction of the railroad was begun in 1887 by the Abingdon Coal and Iron Railroad, but the company folded before the railroad became operational. Construction was continued by the Virginia Western Coal and Iron Railway in 1894, and it was renamed the Virginia–Carolina Railway in 1898, but financial difficulties persisted. The Norfolk and Western Railway funded construction to Damascus, which was completed in 1900. By 1907, the line had reached Taylor's Valley, Virginia. The Hassinger Lumber Company, whose mill was seven miles away in Konnarock, Virginia, built the Virginia-Carolina and Southern Railway to make this connection. Later, the V-C&S; would be absorbed into the V-C, which used it as a branch line to the mill. The V-C was extended through the Blue Ridge Mountains to White Top in 1912 and to its terminus by 1920. The Norfolk and Western absorbed the line in 1919 and operated it as its Abingdon branch until 1977, when operations ceased after flooding damaged portions of the track. Most of the former roadbed in Virginia is occupied by the Virginia Creeper Trail. Efforts are underway to extend the trail into North Carolina.

In Japanese, it is known as goma saba (胡麻鯖 sesame mackerel). It typically reaches in length and in weight.  Description  Blue mackerel are often mistaken for chub mackerel. In fact, blue mackerel were believed to be a subspecies of chub mackerel until the late 1980s. Though they are both in the same genus (Scomber), blue mackerel set themselves apart by differing structural genes than those of the chub mackerel. Other, more obvious, characteristics set these two apart, like the longer anal spine of the blue mackerel, and the amount of the first dorsal spines. Mackerels have a round body that narrows into the tail after the second dorsal fin, similar to a tuna fish.  Distribution and habitat  Throughout the lives of these mackerel, they tend to stay in areas within a few degrees of in tropical to subtropical waters. Off the east coast of North America, populations of mackerel have grown to over 2 million after being depleted in 1982. Blue mackerels can be found from the coast of North America, and as far as Australia and Japan.  Biology and ecology  The blue mackerel is known as a voracious and indiscriminate carnivore, devouring microscopic plankton, krill, anchovies, and dead cut bait, and striking readily on lures and other flies. When in a school and in a feeding frenzy, blue mackerel will strike at nonfood items such as cigarette butts and even bare hooks. They typically eat smaller pelagic fish. Due to their eating habits and their diurnal lifestyles, blue mackerel have evolved large eyes with higher sensitivity in their retinas.  Lifespan  Incubation periods range from 3 to 8 days, growing shorter with warmer temperatures and longer with colder. In the East China Sea, blue mackerel spawn between February and May, when the water temperatures are ideal. In New South Wales, most spawning occurs offshore in waters in depth. The Eastern Australian Current can carry eggs and larvae away from the original spawning grounds, broadening the area in which blue mackerel are located. However, egg and larvae probability of surviving decreases the further they are carried by the current. A mature blue mackerel is considered to be over long. Mackerel can live up to 7 years and grow up to in length, but are most commonly found to be between 1 and 3 years of age. Counting the marks on otoliths determines the age of blue mackerel. Human interactions The blue mackerel can be flighty and difficult to catch, especially in estuaries and harbors. From 300 to 500 million tons of blue mackerel have been caught annually since the mid 1980s, without many fluctuations from month-to-month catches. Blue mackerel are caught for both commercial and private use, for food as well as bait for tuna and other fish. Blue mackerel are often used as cat food, but are also consumed by humans smoked, grilled, or broiled. While easy to fillet and skin, they are difficult to debone, and care must be taken to avoid damaging their soft flesh. Blue mackerel are also commonly used as meat binders. After being freeze-dried, the protein is extracted and put into other meat products to keep the meat and seasonings bound tightly together, allowing costs to be lowered and enhancing the flavor and texture of the product.

It starts at its southernmost end in South Pasadena at Huntington Drive. It travels due north to a terminus above Loma Alta Avenue in Altadena and the gates of Angelus County Park. Beyond this, the road becomes a private easement. At its meeting of Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena the two roads become the zero-zero, east-west, north-south postal division of Pasadena which carries on into Altadena. In South Pasadena, the street numbering varies with its own postal zip code. History 1889 Fair Oaks Avenue looking south from Colorado Street (now Colorado Boulevard). Fair Oaks is one of the major roads developed by the Indiana Colony dating back to 1874. It was apparently named for one of Pasadena's earlier ranches, the Fair Oaks Ranch, named by the widow of General Albert Sidney Johnston for her Virginia home. The road led up from Raymond Hill and north to Washington Boulevard where it met the Painter Hotel. There being little reason to travel more northward, the road dwindled to a watery footpath and meandered through about three miles (5 km) of scrub growth until a similar road picked up in the Altadena Community. At that time, the road was the divider between the Indiana Colony and Benjamin D. Wilson's Lake Vineyard settlement. As the original Indian Colony and the Vineyard colony became friendly economic rivals on each side of the avenue, it became known as the Mason and Dixon line. The intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard became known as \\"The Corners.\\" The avenue, along with Colorado Boulevard became the main streets in the early development of Pasadena with Fair Oaks Avenue being the main route between Los Angeles and Pasadena. In 1895 the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railway built what became the Pacific Electric Railway's South Pasadena Local Red Car line on the entire length of Fair Oaks Avenue to Pasadena from its 6th & Main terminal in Downtown Los Angeles. Also serving the avenue was the North Fair Oaks Avenue Line and the Mount Lowe Railway. The lines were mostly abandoned in the 1920s. At a point of today's 210 Freeway, there was a fork in the road that veered obliquely to the northwest. This was an access to the greatest local water source in Millard Canyon, and was named New Fair Oaks Road. Eventually this road was renamed Lincoln Avenue and Old Fair Oaks Road just became Fair Oaks Avenue. Long considered the center of town, the corner of Colorado and Fair Oaks lost its centrality by the ever eastwardly expansion of the city. But now it has regained its central position as one of the most attractive corners in the upscaled Old Town Pasadena sector. Landmarks and transportation Amongst many landmarks on Fair Oaks Avenue is the Fair Oaks Pharmacy which opened in 1915 and the historic modernest home 1414 Fair Oaks Building which is listed by the Los Angeles Conservancy. Also on the avenue is the Los Angeles College of Music, the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena and the Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena. Fair Oaks Avenue is served mainly by Metro Local line 260 and Metro Rapid line 762.

It has piercing-sucking mouthparts and has become a serious pest on small fruits and vegetables in North America. It is considered a highly polyphagous species and feeds on over half of all commercially grown crop plants, but favors cotton, alfalfa, beans, stone fruits, and conifer seedlings. A study done in southwestern Quebec, Canada has investigated the presence of L. lineolaris in a commercial vineyard.Fleury, D., Mauffette, Y., Methot, S., Vincent, C. (2010). Activity of Lygus lineolaris (Heteroptera: Miridae) Adults Monitored around the Periphery and inside a Commercial Vineyard. European Journal of Entomology, 107(4), Pg. 527-534. This study also indicated that weeds that grow from cultivation of crops serve as an important food source for L. lineolaris. This insect can be found across North America, from northern Canada to southern Mexico. Adults grow up to 6.5 mm in length, and are brown with accents of yellow, orange or red, with a light-colored \\"V\\" on the back (dorsal).  Distribution and diversity  L. lineolaris is most commonly found in the eastern half of North America.Burange, P. S., Roehrdanz, R. L., Boetel, M. A. (2012). Geographically Based Diversity in Mitochondrial DNA of North American Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 105(6), pp. 917–929. A study done to track the genetic diversity and overall distribution of L. lineolaris, specifically on host plants, in North America sampled three separate populations of L. lineolaris and marked their DNA with mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase 1 and cytochrome oxidase 2. The researchers wanted to examine whether the genetic differences found between L. lineolaris species were based on geographical factors. The results indicated significant differences in mtDNA among L. lineolaris species found across North America. Other evidence indicated that L. lineolaris species were found consistently on the same plant hosts but showed no specific preference for plant hosts. The presence of L. lineolaris has been documented in vineyards in Quebec. The results of the Fleury et al. (2010) study indicated that L. lineolaris adults prefer to over-winter in apple orchards because more adults were found inside of the vineyard during winter months. In the summer months (mid-June), the adult L. lineolaris numbers decreased inside of the vineyard because of the decrease in apples and appearance of flowers. Another study observing whether geographical origin has an effect on fecundity, survivorship, hatch rate, and developmental time reported that geographical differences had no effect on the four factors.Fleming, D. E., Roehrdanz, R. L., Allen, K. C., Musser, F. R. (2015). Comparisons of Lygus lineolaris (Hemiptera: Miridae) Populations from Two Distinct Geographical Regions of Mississippi. Environmental Entomology, 44(3), pp. 898–906. Pollen analysis has been used as another method of measuring dispersal in L. lineolaris.Jones, G. D., Allen, K. C. (2013). Pollen Analyses of Tarnished Plant Bugs. Palynology, 37(1), pp. 170–176. Researchers used pollen grains as indicators of food sources being utilized by L. lineolaris as well as their movement between wild host plant habitats and cropping areas. The pollen grains found through analysis indicated that they were from host plants of L. lineolaris. The pollen grains further indicated that L. lineolaris spent time away from crops and instead were found on plants that were in wet or disturbed sites.  Feeding  Close-up of the mouthparts of Lygus lineolaris Although it is known to feed on almost all commercial crops,L. lineolaris specifically prefers to feed on young apples and weeds. The TPB has a special mode of feeding called the \\"lacerate and flush\\" feeding strategy where it uses sucking mouthparts to inject saliva into the host plant. The saliva of the TPB contains an enzyme called polygalacturonase which degrades plant tissue and pectin in the plant cell wall allowing for faster digestion.Showmaker, K. C., Bednarova, A., Gresham, C., Hsu, C. Y., Peterson, D. G., Krishnan, N. (2016). Insight into the Salivary Gland Transcriptome of Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois). PLoS ONE, 11(1), pp. 1–22. Researchers interested in examining other components of L. lineolaris saliva used illumina (Solexa) sequencing to discover the roles of proteins within saliva. They accomplish this via presenting a salivary gland transcriptome of the TPB. The researchers discovered TPB sialotranscriptome that played a role in extra-oral digestion.  Reproduction  A Lygus lineolaris nymph L. lineolaris utilize cotton plants as one of their main reproductive hosts. Females lay eggs in the first row of cotton plants and later occupy more plants in the field. The females usually lay eggs in May after the overwintering period. The eggs hatch and nymphs begin to develop around June.Day, W. H. (2006). The Effect of Rainfall on the Abundance of Tarnished Plant Bug Nymphs [Lygus lineolaris (Palisot)] in Alfalfa Fields. Transactions of the American Entomological Society, 132(3/4), pp. 445–450.  Olfaction  Researchers have conducted experiments involving odourant-binding proteins (OBP) which allow for perception of odours in L. lineolaris and other insect groups. A study involved transcriptomics in order to investigate olfaction in L. lineolaris to reduce its harmful impacts on commercial crops.Hull, J. J., Perera, O. P., Snodgrass, G. L. (2014). Cloning and Expression Profiling of Odorant-binding Proteins in the Tarnished Plant Bug, Lygus lineolaris. Insect Molecular Biology, 23(1), pp. 78–97. The transcriptomics approach indicated that there are 21 LylinOBP transcripts in the antennae, 12 in the legs and 15 in the proboscis. This further identified that these structures play an important role in insect olfaction and taste. Since the antennae are mainly responsible for direction, the presence of olfaction in the antennae can allow for recognition of different substrates. The proboscis is mainly associated with taste therefore the OBP expression in the proboscis and maxillary palp sensilla may be associated with taste in L. lineolaris.  Vision  The visual system in L. lineolaris is not heavily investigated although it could provide insight into the different stimuli that allow these insects to discriminate food sources. A study investigated whether L. lineolaris adults showed distinctive visual responses to two different colours of sticky traps.Legrand, A., Los, L. (2003). Visual Responses of Lygus lineolaris and Lygocoris spp. (Hemiptera: Miridae) on Peaches. Florida Entomologist, 86(4), Pg. 424-428. The researchers decided to use pink and white sticky traps due to previous evidence indicating that pink sticky traps are the most stimulating for L. lineolaris specifically in peach orchards. L. lineolaris were attracted to pink traps as compared with white traps. L. lineolaris have the ability to discriminate colour to an extent and could even detect colour contrast. The pink colour could have provided a better contrast against the peach-coloured background thereby attracting more L. lineolaris adults.  Capturing methods  There are numerous methods used to capture L. lineolaris in order to utilize these insects in scientific studies. Some studies involve capturing the TPB using traps. Researchers used white sticky traps in order to capture TPB in and around a Canadian vineyard. Compared to other methods, sticky traps have been shown to be the most effective in collecting L. lineolaris. Other traps involve using a bed sheet tied with a nylon rope around two metal poles to capture adult TPB. This method requires the use of an eppendorf tube to collect individual TPB for euthanizing purposes. Since adult L. lineolaris have been recorded to fly at about 40 to 100 cm above the ground in vineyards as well as other cultivated fruit crops, traps must be laid out at a height between 40 and 100 cm in order to capture the maximum amount of insects. Sticky traps have been proven to capture L. lineolaris most effectively. Although traps are widely used to collect TPB, sweep nets are also effective in capturing these insects due their small size and tendency to rest on plant leaves. The sweep net method was specifically used for nymphal L. lineolaris. Another study used sweep nets to capture L. lineolaris individuals off wild host plants while also using aspirators to place them into collection containers.  Control   Insecticides and herbicides  Growers routinely make 3–5 applications of insecticides each year to control this insect. Considering the narrow profit margin for today's farmers, the cost of such applications are significant. In the United States, there has been a total of 38% loss of cotton crops due to TPB population. There are approximately 4.1 insecticide applications per hectare annually in the U.S with an estimated cost of $110 per hectare. The increasing cost for insecticides for control of TPB is due to insecticide resistance that occurs in this population due to improper time management when spraying insecticide.Wood, W., Gore, J., Catchot, A., Cook, D., Dodds, D., Krutz, L. J. (2016). Susceptibility of Flowering Cotton to Damage and Yield Loss from Tarnished Plant Bug (Hemiptera: Miridae). Journal of Economic Entomology, 103(9), Pg. 1188-1195. L. lineolaris rely on weeds growing among cultivated crops in order to overwinter therefore application of herbicides on these weeds would serve as an effective control for these insects. To control L. lineolaris population on strawberry plants, methods including insecticides have been used but recently biological controls are being implemented. Because numerous applications of insecticides are used for annual control of L. lineolaris population, there are studies done to examine the proper time period for these applications. One such study by Wood et al. (2016) examined different planting dates in order to determine the optimal time for TPB control on cotton plants. The results obtained from the study indicated that the first four weeks of flowering were the most effective in controlling for L. lineolaris because this is when most cotton yield loss was observed. The researchers discovered through their results that it is more effective to terminate the insecticide earlier than to delay the administration of the insecticide at the beginning of the four-week period. Neonicotinoids are a family of insecticides which cause interference and blockage of the nicotinergic pathway in the central nervous system of insects.Zhu, Y. C., Luttrell, R. (2014). Altered Gene Regulation and Potential Association with Metabolic Resistance Development to Imidacloprid in the Tarnished Plant Bug, Lygus lineolaris. Pest Management Science, 71(1), pp. 40–57. Imidacloprid is part of the neonictinoid family and has been used to control population of L. lineolaris. Previously, a study has been conducted to examine the resistance developed by the TPB to imidacloprid. The results of the study indicated that there were changes in gene expression which was related to resistance of imidacloprid. There was an over-expression of P450 and esterase genes which the researchers connected to imidacloprid resistance by L. lineolaris. A similar study investigating L. lineolaris from two geographical regions in terms of differing developmental time, fecundity, hatch rate, and survivorship was conducted. The researchers were interested in examining the reasons for L. lineolaris being a more influential pest in the Delta region as compared with the Hills region of the Mississippi. Although there were no differences found in the development time, fecundity, hatch rate, and survivorship of the L. lineolaris captured from the Delta and Hills regions, the researchers suggest that the larger area of the Delta region might have caused the L. lineolaris population to be subjected to more insecticides thereby having more resistance and causing more pest-related issues. Biological control In the mid 1980s, parasitic wasps, Peristenus digoneutis, were imported from France and their establishment in the northeastern United States has resulted in reduction of crop losses to the TPB of up to 63% in alfalfa and 65% in apples. The University of Vermont Entomology Laboratory studied various entomopathogenic fungi for pathogenicity against TPB. The fungus Beavaria bassiana is sometimes used to control TPB. Research has been conducted to determine the rate of parasitism by B. bassiana of L. lineolaris in strawberry and alfalfa host plants.Matos, B., Obrycki, J. J. (2004). Abundance and Parasitism of Lygus lineolaris in Alfalfa and Strawberry Fields. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 77(2), pp. 69–79. The research, conducted in Iowa, suggested that L. lineolaris have a detrimental impact on strawberry fruits because feeding damage allows for a decrease in the market value of strawberries.  Physical control  Mowing and maintenance of weed plants can control the population of L. lineolaris adults within crop fields and vineyards. Rainfall can be classified as a form of mechanical control of L. lineolaris because rain drops may knock individuals off plants and cause a reduction in their survival. The results from a study investigating the effects of rainfall on the nymphal population of L. lineolaris indicated that the number of nymphs decreased during the heavy rainfall years. During the years with heavy rainfall, there was also less parasitism of L. lineolaris by the parasitoid wasp P. digoneutis. Due to their results that rainfall decreases L. lineolaris population, the researchers suggested that sprinkler irrigation should be used in alfalfa fields because it simulates rainfall.

It lies on a ridge on the northern bank of the Tywi, with a steep drop of one hundred feet to the river. Dinefwr was the chief seat of the Kingdom of Deheubarth. The castle is a Grade I listed building. Description The castle sits on a hill overlooking the Towy valley. The present castle is entered via a fortified entrance protected by a restored length of battlement. The short path from the car park gives an extensive view of the Towy valley. The door admits the visitor to the main space enclosed by the walls, from which there are several stairs to the main battlements and towers. A narrow spiral staircase leads to a high tower, which gives extensive views of the deer park to the north and the Tywi valley to the south and west. The castle keep is entered via the cellar at its base, but access to the circular walkway at the top can only be made via the battlement walk. Details such as the well and several garderobes are visible in the structure. There is a path around the base of the main structure to the north. History Tradition relates that a castle was first constructed on this site by Rhodri the Great, but no archaeological remains have been dated from this period. Dinefwr later became the chief seat of Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda, first ruler of Deheubarth and later king of most of Wales. Rhys ap Gruffydd, ruler of Deheubarth from 1155 to 1197, is thought to have rebuilt the castle. Giraldus Cambrensis tells a story about a plan by King Henry II of England to assault the castle during a campaign against Rhys. One of Henry's most trusted followers was sent on reconnaissance, guided by a local Welsh cleric, who was asked to lead him to the castle by the easiest route, but instead took the most difficult route he could find, ending the performance by stopping to eat grass with the explanation that this was the diet of the local people in times of hardship. The planned attack was duly abandoned. Rhys ap Gruffydd also built the spectacular castle at Carreg Cennen, about four miles away to the south. It is not visible from Dynefwr, but Dryslwyn Castle can just be seen on a hill blocking the Tywi valley to the south-west. Rhys also founded two religious houses during this period. Talley Abbey was the first Premonstratensian abbey in Wales, while Llanllyr was a Cistercian nunnery, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper. On Rhys ap Gruffydd's death the castle passed to his son Rhys Gryg, and the earliest parts of the present castle are thought to derive from this period. Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd was now extending his influence to this area, and Rhys, finding himself unable to resist, dismantled the castle. Llywelyn however had it restored and held it until his death in 1240. In 1255 Llywelyn the Last gave Dinefwr to Rhys Fychan, then later gave it to Maredudd ap Rhys before later returning it to Rhys Fychan. Maredydd now allied himself to King Edward I of England, and helped Edward capture Dinefwr in 1277. Maredudd had apparently been promised Dinefwr in return for his help, but Edward did not keep his promise and had Maredudd executed in 1291. View from Dinefwr Castle The castle now came into English hands, though it is recorded to have been burnt during the rebellion of Llywelyn Bren in 1316. In 1317 it was given to Hugh Despenser, the king's favourite. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr in 1403. Towards the end of the 15th century the castle was held by Sir Rhys ap Thomas, who carried out extensive rebuilding. In 1531 his grandson Rhys ap Gruffydd was executed for treason and the castle was confiscated by the crown, though the family were later able to recover it. In 1660 Newton House was built nearby and the castle keep modified as a summer house. The remains of the large windows can be seen at the top of the keep, but it burned down in the 18th century. The castle is now owned by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and managed by CADW on their behalf. Public access The castle is now partially owned by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Waleswelswildlife.org (who do not charge for entry) and is managed by Cadw but lies within Dinefwr Park, which is owned by the National Trust. Visitors who wish to see the castle and are driving there, may park in the town and walk up to the Castle using the free Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales access route. If visitors walk or park in the National Trust site and are not National Trust, Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales or Cadw members there is a site entrance charge. There is a small free car park near the castle for disabled badge holders, but it can only be reached by a rough track through a field. Permission can be gained at the National Trust office to drive over the field up to the castle, weather and conditions permitting.

The name means \\"the rockies\\". The commune is composed of six villages: Câlțești, Clondiru de Sus, Dara, Pietroasa Mică, Pietroasele and Șarânga. It became famous with the discovery in 1837 of the Pietroasa Treasure composed of several pieces of gold and precious stones. The Romanian historian Alexandru Odobescu wrote a book on the archaeological discovery. The village is the centre of several archaeological sites such as the Dacian fortress at Dari Gruiu. The six locations that make up the commune were built after the sixteenth century, on the lands of freeholders and lords of the neighbouring village of Bădeni, and were later divided into three municipalities: Pietroasa de Jos, Pietroasa de Sus and Șarânga, which were merged in 1968. Although it was initially a centre for stone extraction, today viticulture is the main economic sector of the village, known for Romanian wine. The Viticulture Research Center found here is managed by the University of Agricultural Sciences in Bucharest. History A Dacian fortress is located at 1,5 km north of Pietroasa Mică village. Ruins of the Roman thermae at Pietroasele near county road. Ruins of a third-fourth century AD Roman castra and thermae were discovered in the area in the 1980s. The Roman fort of Pietroasa de Jos, well beyond the Danubian Limes and near present-day Moldavia, would seem to have been occupied in the fourth century A.D. It was connected to bridge-head forts (Sucidava,Sucidava photos castra of Tirighina-Bărboși, and the unlocated Constantiniana Daphne) along the left bank of the Danube river. Near this Roman fort, built by Constantine I when he created the Constantine Wall of the Limes Moesiae probably around 330 AD, researchers have found even a small thermae building in the 1980s.Archaeological research about Romans in Romania during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD (in Romanian) The Roman fortification (124 m x 158 m) was built in an area where was present the Culture of Pietroasa.Castrul roman de la Pietroasa de Jos (in Romanian) The wall was 2.7 meters thick.

This may include injuring the child or altering test samples. They then present the person as being sick or injured. The behaviour occurs without a specific benefit to the caregiver. Permanent injury or death of the child may occur as a result of the disorder. The cause of FDIA is unknown. The primary motive may be to gain attention and manipulate physicians. Risk factors for FDIA include pregnancy related complications and a mother who was abused as a child or has factitious disorder imposed on self. Diagnosis is supported when removing the child from the caregiver results in improvement of symptoms or video surveillance without the knowledge of the caregiver finds concerns. Those affected by the disorder have been subjected to a form of physical abuse and medical neglect. Management of FDIA may require putting the child in foster care. It is not known how effective therapy is for FDIA; it is assumed it may work for those who admit they have a problem. The prevalence of FDIA is unknown, but it appears to be relatively rare. More than 95% of cases involve a person's mother. The prognosis for the mother is poor. However, there is a burgeoning literature on possible courses of therapy. The condition was first named in 1977 by British paediatrician Roy Meadow. Some aspects of FDIA may represent criminal behavior. Signs and symptoms In factitious disorder imposed on another, a caregiver makes a dependent person appear mentally or physically ill in order to gain attention. To perpetuate the medical relationship, the caregiver systematically misrepresents symptoms, fabricates signs, manipulates laboratory tests, or even purposely harms the dependent (e.g. by poisoning, suffocation, infection, physical injury). Studies have shown a mortality rate of between six and ten percent, making it perhaps the most lethal form of abuse. In one study, the average age of the affected individual at the time of diagnosis was 4 years old. Slightly over 50% were aged 24 months or younger, and 75% were under six years old. The average duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 22 months. By the time of diagnosis, six percent of the affected persons were dead, mostly from apnea (a common result of smothering) or starvation, and seven percent had long-term or permanent injury. About half of the affected had siblings; 25% of the known siblings were dead, and 61% of siblings had symptoms similar to the affected or that were otherwise suspicious. The mother was the perpetrator in 76.5% of the cases, the father in 6.7%. Most present about three medical problems in some combination of the 103 different reported symptoms. The most-frequently reported problems are apnea (26.8% of cases), anorexia or feeding problems (24.6% of cases), diarrhea (20%), seizures (17.5%), cyanosis (blue skin) (11.7%), behavior (10.4%), asthma (9.5%), allergy (9.3%), and fevers (8.6%). Other symptoms include failure to thrive, vomiting, bleeding, rash, and infections. Many of these symptoms are easy to fake because they are subjective. A parent reporting that their child had a fever in the past 24 hours is making a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove. The number and variety of presented symptoms contribute to the difficulty in reaching a proper diagnosis. Aside from the motive (which is to gain attention or sympathy), another feature that differentiates FDIA from \\"typical\\" physical child abuse is the degree of premeditation involved. Whereas most physical abuse entails lashing out at a child in response to some behavior (e.g., crying, bedwetting, spilling food), assaults on the FDIA victim tend to be unprovoked and planned. Also unique to this form of abuse is the role that health care providers play by actively, albeit unintentionally, enabling the abuse. By reacting to the concerns and demands of perpetrators, medical professionals are manipulated into a partnership of child maltreatment. Challenging cases that defy simple medical explanations may prompt health care providers to pursue unusual or rare diagnoses, thus allocating even more time to the child and the abuser. Even without prompting, medical professionals may be easily seduced into prescribing diagnostic tests and therapies that are at best uncomfortable and costly, and at worst potentially injurious to the child. If the health practitioner resists ordering further tests, drugs, procedures, surgeries, or specialists, the FDIA abuser makes the medical system appear negligent for refusing to help a sick child and their selfless parent. Like those with Munchausen syndrome, FDIA perpetrators are known to switch medical providers frequently until they find one that is willing to meet their level of need; this practice is known as \\"doctor shopping\\" or \\"hospital hopping\\". The perpetrator continues the abuse because maintaining the child in the role of patient satisfies the abuser's needs. The cure for the victim is to separate the child completely from the abuser. When parental visits are allowed, sometimes there is a disastrous outcome for the child. Even when the child is removed, the perpetrator may then abuse another child: a sibling or other child in the family. Factitious disorder imposed on another can have many long-term emotional effects on a child. Depending on their experience of medical interventions, a percentage of children may learn that they are most likely to receive the positive maternal attention they crave when they are playing the sick role in front of health care providers. Several case reports describe Munchausen syndrome patients suspected of themselves having been FDIA victims. Seeking personal gratification through illness can thus become a lifelong and multi-generational disorder in some cases. In stark contrast, other reports suggest survivors of FDIA develop an avoidance of medical treatment with post-traumatic responses to it. This variation possibly reflects broad statistics on survivors of child abuse in general, where around 35% of abusers were a victim of abuse in the past. The adult caregiver who has abused the child often seems comfortable and not upset over the child's hospitalization. While the child is hospitalized, medical professionals must monitor the caregiver's visits to prevent an attempt to worsen the child's condition. In addition, in many jurisdictions, medical professionals have a duty to report such abuse to legal authorities.Elder W, Coletsos IC, Bursztajn HJ. Factitious Disorder/Munchhausen Syndrome. The 5-Minute Clinical Consult. 18th Edition. 2010. Editor: Domino F.J. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott. Philadelphia. Diagnosis Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term. In the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), the official diagnosis is factitious disorder (301.51 in ICD-9, F68.12 in ICD-10). Within the United States, factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA or FDIoA) was officially recognized as a disorder in 2013, while in the United Kingdom, it is known as fabricated or induced illness by carers (FII). In DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013, this disorder is listed under 300.19 Factitious disorder. This, in turn, encompasses two types: * Factitious disorder imposed on self – (formerly Munchausen syndrome). * Factitious disorder imposed on another – (formerly Munchausen syndrome by proxy); diagnosis assigned to the perpetrator; the person affected may be assigned an abuse diagnosis (e.g. child abuse).  Warning signs  Warning signs of the disorder include: * A child who has one or more medical problems that do not respond to treatment or that follow an unusual course that is persistent, puzzling, and unexplained. * Physical or laboratory findings that are highly unusual, discrepant with patient's presentation or history, or physically or clinically impossible. * A parent who appears medically knowledgeable, fascinated with medical details and hospital gossip, appears to enjoy the hospital environment, and expresses interest in the details of other patients' problems. * A highly attentive parent who is reluctant to leave their child's side and who themselves seem to require constant attention. * A parent who appears unusually calm in the face of serious difficulties in their child's medical course while being highly supportive and encouraging of the physician, or one who is angry, devalues staff, and demands further intervention, more procedures, second opinions, and transfers to more sophisticated facilities. * The suspected parent may work in the health-care field themselves or profess an interest in a health-related job. * The signs and symptoms of a child's illness may lessen or simply vanish in the parent's absence (hospitalization and careful monitoring may be necessary to establish this causal relationship). * A family history of similar or unexplained illness or death in a sibling. * A parent with symptoms similar to their child's own medical problems or an illness history that itself is puzzling and unusual. * A suspected emotionally distant relationship between parents; the spouse often fails to visit the patient and has little contact with physicians even when the child is hospitalized with a serious illness. * A parent who reports dramatic, negative events, such as house fires, burglaries, or car accidents, that affect them and their family while their child is undergoing treatment. * A parent who seems to have an insatiable need for adulation or who makes self-serving efforts for public acknowledgment of their abilities. * A child who inexplicably deteriorates whenever discharge is planned. * A child that looks for cueing from a parent in order to feign illness when medical personnel are present. * A child that is overly articulate regarding medical terminology and their own disease process for their age. * A child that presents to the Emergency Department with a history of repeat illness, injury, or hospitalization. Epidemiology FDIA is rare. A study in Italy found that 4 out of more than 700 children admitted to the hospital met the criteria (0.53%). In this study, stringent diagnostic criteria were used, which required at least one test outcome or event that could not possibly have occurred without deliberate intervention by the FDIA person. One study showed that in 93 percent of FDIA cases, the abuser is the mother or another female guardian or caregiver. A psychodynamic model of this kind of maternal abuse exists.See Anna Motz's The Psychology of Female Violence: Crimes Against the Body (Routledge, 2001 , 2nd ed. forthcoming 2008 ). FDIA may be more prevalent in the parents of those with a learning difficulty or mental incapacity, and as such the apparent patient could, in fact, be an adult. Fathers and other male caregivers have been the perpetrators in only seven percent of the cases studied. When they are not actively involved in the abuse, the fathers or male guardians of FDIA victims are often described as being distant, emotionally disengaged, and powerless. These men play a passive role in FDIA by being frequently absent from the home and rarely visiting the hospitalized child. Usually, they vehemently deny the possibility of abuse, even in the face of overwhelming evidence or their child's pleas for help. Overall, male and female children are equally likely to be the victim of FDIA. In the few cases where the father is the perpetrator, however, the victim is three times more likely to be male. Society and culture Terminology The term \\"Munchausen syndrome by proxy\\", in the United States, has never officially been included as a discrete mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), now in its fifth edition. Although the DSM-III (1980) and DSM-III-R (1987) included Munchausen syndrome, they did not include MSbP. DSM- IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000) added MSbP as a proposal only, and although it was finally recognized as a disorder in DSM-5 (2013), each of the last three editions of the DSM designated the disorder by a different name. FDIA has been given different names in different places and at different times. What follows is a partial list of alternative names that have been either used or proposed (with approximate dates): * Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (current) (U.S., 2013) American Psychiatric Association, DSM-5 * Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP, FDbP) (proposed) (U.S., 2000) American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV-TR * Fictitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP, FDbP) (proposed) (U.S., 1994) American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV * Fabricated or Induced Illness by Carers (FII) (U.K., 2002) The Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health * Factitious Illness by Proxy (1996) World Health Organization * Pediatric Condition Falsification (PCF) (proposed) (U.S., 2002) American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children proposed this term to diagnose the victim (child); the perpetrator (caregiver) would be diagnosed \\"factitious disorder by proxy\\"; MSbP would be retained as the name applied to the 'disorder' that contains these two elements, a diagnosis in the child and a diagnosis in the caretaker. * Induced Illness (Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy) (Ireland, 1999–2002) Department of Health and Children * Meadow's Syndrome (1984–1987) named after Roy Meadow. This label, however, had already been in use since 1957 to describe a completely unrelated and rare form of cardiomyopathy. * Polle Syndrome (1977–1984) coined by Burman and Stevens, from the then-common belief that Baron Münchhausen's second wife gave birth to a daughter named Polle during their marriage. The baron declared that the baby was not his, and the child died from \\"seizures\\" at the age of 10 months. The name fell out of favor after 1984, when it was discovered that Polle was not the baby's name, but rather was the name of her mother's hometown. While it initially included only the infliction of harmful medical care, the term has subsequently been extended to include cases in which the only harm arose from medical neglect, noncompliance, or even educational interference. The term is derived from Munchausen syndrome, a psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. Munchausen syndrome by proxy perpetrators, by contrast, are willing to fulfill their need for positive attention by hurting their own child, thereby assuming the sick role onto their child, by proxy. These proxies then gain personal attention and support by taking on this fictitious \\"hero role\\" and receive positive attention from others, by appearing to care for and save their so-called sick child. They are named after Baron Munchausen, a literary character based on Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–1797), a German nobleman and well- known storyteller. In 1785, writer and con artist Rudolf Erich Raspe anonymously published a book in which a fictional version of \\"Baron Munchausen\\" tells fantastic and impossible stories about himself, establishing a popular literary archetype of a bombastic exaggerator. Initial description \\"Munchausen syndrome\\" was first described by R. Asher in 1951 as when someone invents or exaggerates medical symptoms, sometimes engaging in self-harm, to gain attention or sympathy. The term \\"Munchausen syndrome by proxy\\" was first coined by John Money and June Faith Werlwas in a 1976 paper titled Folie à deux in the parents of psychosocial dwarfs: Two cases to describe the abuse-induced and neglect-induced symptoms of the syndrome of abuse dwarfism. That same year, Sneed and Bell wrote an article titled The Dauphin of Munchausen: factitious passage of renal stones in a child. According to other sources, the term was created by the British pediatrician Roy Meadow in 1977. In 1977, Roy Meadow – then professor of pediatrics at the University of Leeds, England – described the extraordinary behavior of two mothers. According to Meadow, one had poisoned her toddler with excessive quantities of salt. The other had introduced her own blood into her baby's urine sample. This second case occurred during a series of Outpatient visits to the Paediatric Clinic of Dr. Bill Arrowsmith at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. He referred to this behavior as Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP). The medical community was initially skeptical of FDIA's existence, but it gradually gained acceptance as a recognized condition. There are now more than 2,000 case reports of FDIA in the literature. Reports come from developing countries, as well as the U.S., with one case from 2012-2013, in Orlando, Florida, and the most recent in Westchester, New York, in early 2015. Other reports come from Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Oman. Controversy During the 1990s and early 2000s, Roy Meadow was an expert witness in several murder cases involving MSbP/FII. Meadow was knighted for his work for child protection, though later, his reputation, and consequently the credibility of MSbP, became damaged when several convictions of child killing, in which he acted as an expert witness, were overturned. The mothers in those cases were wrongly convicted of murdering two or more of their children, and had already been imprisoned for up to six years. One case was that of Sally Clark. Clark was a lawyer wrongly convicted in 1999 of the murder of her two baby sons, largely on the basis of Meadow's evidence. As an expert witness for the prosecution, Meadow asserted that the odds of there being two unexplained infant deaths in one family were one in 73 million. That figure was crucial in sending Clark to jail but was hotly disputed by the Royal Statistical Society, who wrote to the Lord Chancellor to complain. It was subsequently shown that the true odds were much greater once other factors (e.g. genetic or environmental) were taken into consideration, meaning that there was a significantly higher likelihood of two deaths happening as a chance occurrence than Meadow had claimed during the trial. Those odds in fact range from a low of 1:8500 to as high as 1:200. It emerged later that there was clear evidence of a Staphylococcus aureus infection that had spread as far as the child's cerebrospinal fluid. Clark was released in January 2003 after three judges quashed her convictions in the Court of Appeal in London, but suffering from catastrophic trauma of the experience, she later died from alcohol poisoning. Meadow was involved as a prosecution witness in three other high-profile cases resulting in mothers being imprisoned and subsequently cleared of wrongdoing: Trupti Patel, Angela Cannings and Donna Anthony. In 2003, Lord Howe, the Opposition spokesman on health, accused Meadow of inventing a \\"theory without science\\" and refusing to produce any real evidence to prove that Munchausen syndrome by proxy actually exists. It is important to distinguish between the act of harming a child, which can be easily verified, and motive, which is much harder to verify and which FDIA tries to explain. For example, a caregiver may wish to harm a child out of malice and then attempt to conceal it as illness to avoid detection of abuse, rather than to draw attention and sympathy. The distinction is often crucial in criminal proceedings, in which the prosecutor must prove both the act and the mental element constituting a crime to establish guilt. In most legal jurisdictions, a doctor can give expert witness testimony as to whether a child was being harmed but cannot speculate regarding the motive of the caregiver. FII merely refers to the fact that illness is induced or fabricated and does not specifically limit the motives of such acts to a caregiver's need for attention and/or sympathy. In all, around 250 cases resulting in conviction in which Meadow was an expert witness were reviewed, with few changes, but all where the only evidence was Meadows' expert testimony were overturned. Meadow was investigated by the British General Medical Council (GMC) over evidence he gave in the Sally Clark trial. In July 2005, the GMC declared Meadow guilty of \\"serious professional misconduct\\", and he was struck off the medical register for giving \\"erroneous\\" and \\"misleading\\" evidence. At appeal, High Court judge Mr. Justice Collins said that the severity of his punishment \\"approaches the irrational\\" and set it aside. Collins's judgment raises important points concerning the liability of expert witnesses – his view is that referral to the GMC by the losing side is an unacceptable threat and that only the Court should decide whether its witnesses are seriously deficient and refer them to their professional bodies. In addition to the controversy surrounding expert witnesses, an article appeared in the forensic literature that detailed legal cases involving controversy surrounding the murder suspect. The article provides a brief review of the research and criminal cases involving Munchausen syndrome by proxy in which psychopathic mothers and caregivers were the murderers. It also briefly describes the importance of gathering behavioral data, including observations of the parents who commit the criminal acts. The article references the 1997 work of Southall, Plunkett, Banks, Falkov, and Samuels, in which covert video recorders were used to monitor the hospital rooms of suspected FDIA victims. In 30 out of 39 cases, a parent was observed intentionally suffocating their child; in two they were seen attempting to poison a child; in another, the mother deliberately broke her 3-month-old daughter's arm. Upon further investigation, those 39 patients, ages 1 month to 3 years old, had 41 siblings; 12 of those had died suddenly and unexpectedly. The use of covert video, while apparently extremely effective, raises controversy in some jurisdictions over privacy rights. Legal status In most legal jurisdictions, doctors are allowed to give evidence only in regard to whether the child is being harmed. They are not allowed to give evidence in regard to the motive. Australia and the UK have established the legal precedent that FDIA does not exist as a medico-legal entity. In a June 2004 appeal hearing, the Supreme Court of Queensland, Australia, stated: The Queensland Supreme Court further ruled that the determination of whether or not a defendant had caused intentional harm to a child was a matter for the jury to decide and not for the determination by expert witnesses: Principles of law and implications for legal processes that may be deduced from these findings are that: *Any matters brought before a Court of Law should be determined by the facts, not by suppositions attached to a label describing a behavior, i.e., MSBP/FII/FDBP; *MSBP/FII/FDBP is not a mental disorder (i.e., not defined as such in DSM IV), and the evidence of a psychiatrist should not therefore be admissible; *MSBP/FII/FDBP has been stated to be a behavior describing a form of child abuse and not a medical diagnosis of either a parent or a child. A medical practitioner cannot therefore state that a person \\"suffers\\" from MSBP/FII/FDBP, and such evidence should also therefore be inadmissible. The evidence of a medical practitioner should be confined to what they observed and heard and what forensic information was found by recognized medical investigative procedures; *A label used to describe a behavior is not helpful in determining guilt and is prejudicial. By applying an ambiguous label of MSBP/FII to a woman is implying guilt without factual supportive and corroborative evidence; *The assertion that other people may behave in this way, i.e., fabricate and/or induce illness in children to gain attention for themselves (FII/MSBP/FDBY), contained within the label is not factual evidence that this individual has behaved in this way. Again therefore, the application of the label is prejudicial to fairness and a finding based on fact. The Queensland Judgment was adopted into English law in the High Court of Justice by Mr. Justice Ryder. In his final conclusions regarding Factitious Disorder, Ryder states that: In his book Playing Sick (2004), Marc Feldman notes that such findings have been in the minority among U.S. and even Australian courts. Pediatricians and other physicians have banded together to oppose limitations on child-abuse professionals whose work includes FII detection. The April 2007 issue of the journal Pediatrics specifically mentions Meadow as an individual who has been inappropriately maligned. Notable cases Beverley Allitt, a British nurse who murdered four children and injured a further nine in 1991 at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Wendi Michelle Scott is a Frederick, Maryland, mother who was charged with sickening her four-year-old daughter. The book Sickened, by Julie Gregory, details her life growing up with a mother suffering from Munchausen by proxy, who took her to various doctors, coached her to act sicker than she was and to exaggerate her symptoms, and who demanded increasingly invasive procedures to diagnose Gregory's enforced imaginary illnesses. Lisa Hayden-Johnson of Devon was jailed for three years and three months after subjecting her son to a total of 325 medical actions – including being forced to use a wheelchair and being fed through a tube in his stomach. She claimed her son had a long list of illnesses including diabetes, food allergies, cerebral palsy, and cystic fibrosis, describing him as \\"the most ill child in Britain\\" and receiving numerous cash donations and charity gifts, including two cruises. In the mid-1990s, Kathy Bush gained public sympathy for the plight of her daughter, Jennifer, who by the age of 8 had undergone 40 surgeries and spent over 640 days in hospitals for gastrointestinal disorders. The acclaim led to a visit with first lady Hillary Clinton, who championed the Bushs' plight as evidence of need for medical reform. However, in 1996, Kathy Bush was arrested and charged with child abuse and Medicaid fraud, accused of sabotaging Jennifer's medical equipment and drugs to agitate and prolong her illness. Jennifer was moved to foster care where she quickly regained her health. The prosecutors claimed Kathy was driven by Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, and she was convicted to a five-year sentence in 1999. Kathy was released after serving three years in 2005, always maintaining her innocence, and having gotten back in contact with Jennifer via correspondence. In 2014, 26-year-old Lacey Spears was charged in Westchester County, New York, with second-degree depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter. She fed her son dangerous amounts of salt after she conducted research on the Internet about its effects. Her actions were allegedly motivated by the social media attention she gained on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. She was convicted of second-degree murder on March 2, 2015, and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Dee Dee Blanchard was a Missouri mother who was murdered by her daughter and a boyfriend in 2015 after having claimed for years that her daughter, Gypsy Rose, was sick and disabled; to the point of shaving her head, making her use a wheelchair in public, and subjecting her to unnecessary medication and surgery. Gypsy possessed no outstanding illnesses. Feldman said it is the first case he is aware of in a quarter-century of research where the victim killed the abuser. Their story was shown on HBO's documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest and is featured in the first season of the Hulu anthology series The Act. Rapper Eminem has spoken about how his mother would frequently take him to hospitals to receive treatment for illnesses that he did not have. His song “Cleanin' Out My Closet” includes a lyric regarding the illness, “...going through public housing systems victim of Münchausen syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn’t ‘til I grew up and blew up...” His mother's illness resulted in Eminem receiving custody of his younger brother, Nathan. In 2013, Boston Children's Hospital filed a 51A report to take custody of Justina Pelletier, who was 14 at the time. At 21 she was living with her parents. Her parents are suing Boston Children's Hospital, alleging that their civil rights were violated when she was committed to a psychiatric ward and their access to her was limited. At the trial, Pelletier's treating neurologist described how her parents encouraged her to be sick and were endangering her health. Directed towards animals Medical literature describes a subset of FDIA caregivers, where the proxy is a pet rather than another person. These cases are labeled Munchausen syndrome by proxy: pet (MSbP:P). In these cases, pet owners correspond to caregivers in traditional FDIA presentations involving human proxies. No extensive survey has yet been made of the extant literature, and there has been no speculation as to how closely FDIA:P tracks with human FDIA.

The service was initially run as a trial from 15 May 2006 until becoming a full service on 1 December 2007 before closing on 26 March 2013. It broadcast only during the afternoon and evening and only broadcast material shot in High Definition, either in a simulcast with another channel or by inserting a repeat of an HD programme. The channel featured a mix of programming including new episodes of Top Gear, Doctor Who and Hustle, repeats of HD programmes including Planet Earth, Bleak House and Torchwood as well as live coverage of large events such as The Proms, Wimbledon, the Eurovision Song Contest and the FIFA World Cup. The channel was replaced by an HD simulcast of BBC Two, partly as a result of budget cuts affecting the entire corporation. History Trial BBC HD began as a trial station on 15 May 2006 to test the possibility and technical practicality of broadcasting programmes in HD. The first programme to be broadcast that was specifically made for HD was natural history programme Planet Earth, which was shown on 27 May 2006. The trial by 450 businesses and homes was set to last until June 2007, however just before this deadline the BBC Trust began a Public Value Test of the service to determine whether, as the BBC argued, the service was of worth to the general public. As a result, the HD service was extended throughout the testing period which began on 21 May. The result of the test was announced on 19 November that they had approved the BBC Executive's high definition television proposals to allow the launch of UK's first free-to-air, mixed-genre public service HD channel. Official Launch The channel officially launched on 1 December 2007 although much of the programme makeup and format of the broadcasts remained the same from the trial. This new channel was nationwide and platform neutral, in that it was carried by all providers as a free to air channel. This channel, as recommended by the BBC Trust's Public Value Test, broadcast only for around nine hours a day during prime time and only showed programmes made specifically for HD. The channel would air programmes from across the BBC channels. This arrangement continued until 2010, when the increase in HD content saw several changes. 2010 had been the BBC's internal deadline for the majority of new content to be produced in HD and as a result the broadcast space was fast running out. As a result, on 3 November 2010, BBC One HD launched as a separate simulcast of the channel and at approximately the same time, BBC HD's broadcast hours were extended to twelve hours a day. The channel now catered for the programming of the BBC's channels other than BBC One. From 2011, the channel also began to experiment with showing select programmes in 3D. The first such broadcasts were the live men's and women's finals of the 2011 Wimbledon Championships and continued with the broadcast of that year's Strictly Come Dancing final in December. 2012 saw one of the most ambitious levels of 3D coverage with the BBC screening the opening and closing ceremonies and the men's 100m final of the 2012 Summer Olympics including a daily highlights programme in 3D. In addition to this, the channel also broadcast in 3D the men's and women's finals of the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, the natural history programme Planet Dinosaur Ultimate Killers in August, the second half of the Last Night of the Proms on 8 September 2012, the adaptation of Mr Stink on 23 December 2012 and Killer Dinosaurs and the Royal Christmas Message on 25 December. Closure Initial reports of the closure of the channel began to surface in July 2011 when Broadcast magazine claimed that the BBC HD would become more of a simulcast of BBC Two when Danielle Nagler, head of HD and 3D at the BBC, left the corporation in September. Although this was later disproved, it caused speculation about the channel's future given that the new head of the channel was Janice Hadlow, controller of BBC Two. The channel's future was again called into question following the BBC's Delivering Quality First review of the corporations spending. The review sought cost-cutting measures following the government settlement that froze the license fee, reducing the BBC's income, and saw the corporation take on additional responsibility for funding some services. The review recommended that BBC HD should close and be replaced with a simulcast of BBC Two. The proposals were approved by the BBC Trust in May 2012 and subsequently, BBC Two HD launched on 26 March 2013, replacing BBC HD. Broadcast 2005 World Athletics Championships, Helsinki. Availability At the time of the official launch, BBC HD was available universally on all HD broadcasters as a free-to-air station. Satellite viewers could watch the channel on Freesat or Sky, who received their signal from the Astra 1N satellite. The channel was also available to cable television customers through Virgin Media's basic package. The service was also carried on digital terrestrial television in London, from Crystal Palace, until May 2007 as part of the channel's trial and gradually made available nationwide on a region-by-region basis from 2 December 2009. The service expanded into the Republic of Ireland with the channel's carriage on UPC Ireland's Digital+ HD service from the 5 August 2009 and on the Sky Ireland platform from the 27 April 2010. Technical Specifications The channel was broadcast at a display resolution of 1440 by 1080i, which despite being less than the usual 1920 by 1080 resolution used for HD broadcasts was still acceptable to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) of which the BBC is a member. But after years of pressure from bloggers and tech experts alike, the BBC finally relented and switched BBC HD to full 1920 resolution for all broadcasts, not just when 3D was being broadcast. The channel encoded in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC for satellite and terrestrial broadcasts and in MPEG-2 for cable transmissions. Over time changes were made to the way that the channel is broadcast or received. Following the launch of BBC One HD on 3 November 2010, both the new channel and BBC HD were statistically multiplexed on the satellite feeds. Equally, on 6 June 2011, the satellite transponder carrying BBC One HD and BBC HD was upgraded to DVB-S2. In addition to the satellite changes, alterations were made in March 2011 for the Freeview HD encoders to change automatically between 1080i at 50 frames per second to 1080p at 25 frames per second depending on the programme's GOP. Unfortunately some receivers did not handle the transitions between these modes well, resulting in sound and picture disruption. 2009-2010 bitrate drop On 5 August 2009, the channel's satellite encoders on the Astra 2D satellite were replaced by newer models. A side effect of this change was a drop in bitrate from 16 Megabits per second (Mb/s) to 9.7 Mbit/s, leading to a large number of complaints to the BBC. The problem only occurred on the satellite platforms as the cable versions were encoded by the provider themselves and so remained at 17 Mbit/s while the later launched terrestrial version was statistically multiplexed between 3 Mbit/s and 17 Mbit/s. Further anger ensued that the new satellite bitrate fell below the recommendations set out by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), of which the BBC is a member. These recommend a minimum of 12 Mbit/s, but as Andy Quested, principal technologist at the BBC stated, the current technology gave a consistent reliable output of 8-10 Mbit/s which would soon become the requirements with improved technology. Within four months of the change, by mid December, the number of complaints on this issue to the BBC reached 130 of which one was passed straight to the BBC Trust. At around the same time a petition was added to the official Number10 website in December 2009, petitioning then Prime Minister Gordon Brown to bring the BBC into line with the EBU standards. The petition was sparked by the BBC's insistence that there was no problem with the bit rate. In addition, tests run by consumer publication Which?, published in December 2009, found no significant decline in picture quality on the BBC HD channel, labelling the difference in picture quality between the new and old BBC HD broadcasts as \\"insignificant\\". Meanwhile, the international version of BBC HD continued to broadcast on satellite at the higher bitrate and screen resolution. The following year, on 30 April 2010, a delegation of viewers who had complained met with Andy Quested and Danielle Nagler to argue that BBC HD was failing to \\"deliver a very high quality technical service to viewers, by adhering to, or seeking to exceed, industry standards for picture resolution\\". The visitors took part in an evaluation of the new and old encoder's picture quality (by an ITU R500 test) and the results demonstrated that the new encoder, at much reduced bit rate, was not only \\"as good as\\" but actually much better than the old. The issue was resolved when, on 3 June 2010, the BBC introduced variable bitrate encoding and fixed previous problems with mixing, fading and noise in pictures. The variable bitrate encoding allowed the channel to maintain the same average bandwidth while allowing an increase in bitrate for more demanding programme scenes such as fast movement. Equally the fixes for mixing and fading treated specific problems with changing scenes, while a configuration change for ‘noisy’ video means the BBC no longer needed to use noise reduction techniques that often reduced the overall picture quality. The changes were welcomed by campaigners. 3D Broadcasts Whenever the BBC has broadcast programmes or events in 3D, there were other technical changes made to the channel that accompanied it. The BBC's first broadcast of the Wimbledon finals in 2011 saw the screen resolution increased from the usual 1440 by 1080 to 1920 by 1080 between 13 June and 6 July. Equally, the same occurred for the 2011 Strictly Come Dancing final when the resolution was changed between 8 December 2011 and 5 January 2012. An increase to 1920 horizontal resolution was again observed on 30 May 2012 as part of the preparations of 2012's 3D broadcasts. Presentation The BBC HD channel only ever ran at its peak for an average of twelve hours a day, usually from mid afternoon, and was only ever allowed to expand beyond these hours for coverage of significant sporting events. When off air, the channel would broadcast a looped series of clips identified as the BBC HD Preview. These were of extended trailers and extracts for upcoming programmes on the channel separated by the channel's idents. These segments were also notable in their hourly broadcasts of the HD testcard, nicknamed Test Card X, overlaid with a BLITS audio test signal which allowed users to test and adjust their picture quality and position and the quality of their surround sound respectively. Equally, an audio visual synchronization animation was also broadcast hourly. The channel's presentation was unique from the other BBC channels and used its own style of programme idents and trailers. The channel originally used an ident that featured a diamond shape falling backwards down a stream before exploding to several more diamond shapes before taking its place back where it started to be back-lit over an announcement. These were used until 2009 when the presentation changed to a style featuring an ordinary scene which would become extraordinary when viewed through a rotating diamond shape. An example of this was a cat chasing pigeons that was seen as a lion when looked through the diamond shape. Original programme trailers and slides used the back-lit diamond shape as a base, while the 2009 versions used bright colours and textures inspired from the idents, for example the picnic blanket from the cat ident. Programming The channel's programmes were sourced from every BBC channel and were of a mixed genre. The channel would only broadcast productions made in high definition and would not upscale any programmes from standard definition for use on the channel - in contrast to the BBC One HD and BBC Two HD simulcast services. Any individual programme could contain of up to 25 per cent non-HD material converted from SD, for example archive shots in a documentary. Some high definition recording formats like HDV as well as some film formats like 16 mm are considered by BBC to be \\"non-HD\\". As many of the BBC's top productions were made in HD from soon after the channel launched, many of these productions were broadcast on the station at some point. Live events The channel had broadcast several live and significant events in HD. Sporting events include the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, the Australian Open and French Open from 2009, the FIFA World Cup 2006 and 2010, the Euro 2008 Championships, the US Masters golf, Open Golf, England football internationals, action from the FA Cup and Six Nations rugby. The channel also broadcast the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. For the latter, the channel simulcast BBC Three's Olympic coverage and broadcast some of BBC Two's content in HD late at night, time permitting. In 2008, BBC Sport officials indicated that they hoped to offer all of their output in HD by 2012, based on the availability of global feeds and planned new studios or HD-friendly renovations in London and Manchester.BBC - Sport Editors: Plenty to look forward to in 2009 Non sport broadcast include simulcasts of The Proms, the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the 2009 United States presidential inauguration and coverage of the 2010 United Kingdom General Election Children The channel also aired select CBBC and CBeebies shows, a schedule in 2009 shows: *16:00 – In the Night Garden (CBeebies) *16:30 – Gigglebiz CBeebies) *16:45 – LazyTown Extra (CBeebies) *17:00 – M.I.

History  The station was opened on 22 August 1848 by the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway, as part of its line from Richmond to . The line was further extended from Datchet to on 1 December 1849, by which time the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway had become part of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). The junction at Staines, together with the line to was authorised in 1853 and built by the Staines, Wokingham and Woking Junction Railway, opening as far as on 4 June 1856 and onwards to Wokingham on 9 July 1856. From the outset, the line was leased to, and operated by, the LSWR, who purchased it outright in 1878. From Wokingham, LSWR trains continued to using running powers over the South Eastern Railway (SER).The Times, Thursday 24 August 1848Mitchell, Vic and Smith, Keith (1989) Branch lines around Ascot, 1st ed, Middleton Press, MidhurstMaggs, Colin C. (1993) Branch Lines of Berkshire, 1st ed, Alan Sutton Publishing, Stroud In the grouping of railways in 1923, the LSWR and SER became part of the Southern Railway. In 1930 the Windsor line was electrified on the third rail system at a nominal 660 volts DC. The line towards Reading was electrified as far as in 1937, and throughout by 1939. The Southern Railway was nationalised along with the rest of the railway network in 1948 and incorporated into British Railways. Following the privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s, the operation of Staines station and the trains serving it were transferred to the South West Trains train operating company, owned by the Stagecoach Group, whilst ownership and management of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack and, subsequently, Network Rail. A refurbishment of the station was completed in November 2008 with ticket barriers on the platforms and a renovated ticket office. Wheelchair access to the platforms was provided by a new footbridge with lifts.  Setting and previous name  The station serves the town of Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey in southern England to the west of London and is a pre-junction/junction station for the diverging Windsor line. The Windsor Line, a branch of the longer route to Reading laid out as the original destination for the lines from London via Staines, is due to quirk of naming conventions in the rail sector, rarely referred to as a branch line. Both lines are traditionally referred to as \\"the Windsor Lines\\" and the passenger lobby group influencing the service pattern of the lines is named the Windsor Lines Passenger Group. The station is managed by South Western Railway on a contract awarded by recurring private franchise, who continue passenger services to/from London Waterloo as since the middle of the 20th century to , and . The station was one of three – the others were , on the Windsor line, and , the terminus of a defunct branch of a main west-facing route from to the north. To distinguish it from the others during their existence the station was known as Staines Central, Staines Junction and Staines Old. \\\\- pp.37  Operation   Layout  Staines railway station is a conventional (double-track) railway, immediately east of the junction of the Windsor and Reading lines, having converged. It has two flanking platforms, with the main station entrance and buildings on the northern platform 1, and a secondary entrance and buildings on the southern platform 2. The two platforms are linked by two footbridges, one at each end of the station. The older western bridge is accessed by stairs. The newer eastern bridge has stairs and lifts to make it wheelchair accessible.There are toilets on Platform 2.  Services  Staines railway station is served by South Western Railway services from London Waterloo to Windsor, Reading and Weybridge. Off-peak, each of these services operates two trains per hour, combining to provide six trains per hour from Staines to Waterloo (four are limited stop via Richmond, the other two are all stations via ). Some early morning & late night services start or terminate here and there are additional weekday peak period trains on the Reading line and to/from . On Sundays, there is an hourly stopping service on the line via Brentford - this runs to/from rather than Weybridge. The Reading & Windsor lines still run half-hourly. Trains to Waterloo stop at platform 1 and trains from Waterloo stop at platform 2.  Connections  Staines station is south-east of Staines town centre. The two are linked by a walking route that first parallels the Windsor line to the north-west, before passing under the line near the site of the former Staines High Street station. The 950 Thorpe Park Express bus link runs between the front of the station and the nearby Thorpe Park theme park. London Buses route 117 and 290 have stops 50m north of the station. Other buses operate from the bus station accessed via a broad archway and surface car park from the path to the town centre. Service expansion schemes Steam revival locomotive calling point Since the early 2000s British Summer Time excursions, mainly at weekends, are driven by luxury steam locomotives calling at Staines for day-trip tours of towns and tea room villages in or including Bath, other parts of Somerset, Dorset, west Wiltshire, Devon, Winchester and Salisbury.

Additional route and track proposals Heathrow Southern Railway (proposed) Since 2000, a number of transport proposals have been put forward to improve rail connections with Heathrow Airport. The Heathrow Airtrack scheme, proposed in 2000 by BAA, envisaged the creation of a direct rail service from Heathrow Airport via Staines to Waterloo. The scheme would have involved reopening part of the disused Staines and West Drayton line and the construction of a spur line to . A new station was also planned close to the site of the former Staines High Street railway station. The new link would also have enabled the existing Heathrow Express service to be extended from Heathrow to terminate at Staines. Heathrow Airtrack was abandoned in 2011 due to forecast problems with the large number of level crossings on the route into London. A further scheme for new rail links to Heathrow via Staines is currently at the proposal stage. The Heathrow Southern Railway was put forward by a business consortium to create links west of Heathrow Airport with the Waterloo–Reading line, the Great Western main line and the Hounslow Loop Line, including a link to Staines. The plans include the construction of an extra platform at Staines to accommodate a possible extension of the Elizabeth Line (Crossrail) to terminate here. Two early 21st century proposals short of central government pledge stage, or Network Rail proposals, exist for the Hounslow Loop Line, further details of which are mentioned at Syon Lane.

Sponsored by Senator Luke P. Poland of Vermont, the Act redefined the jurisdiction of Utah courts by giving the United States district courts exclusive jurisdiction in Utah Territory over all civil and criminal cases. The Act also eliminated the territorial marshal and attorney, giving their duties to a U.S. Marshal and a U.S. Attorney. The Act also altered petit and grand jury empaneling rules to keep polygamists off juries. By removing Latter-day Saints from positions of authority in the Utah justice system, the Act was intended to allow for successful prosecutions of Mormon polygamists. Background In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the anti- bigamy bill known as the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, but it was not rigorously enforced against Mormons in Utah Territory. This \\"legislation struck at both polygamy and Church power by prohibiting plural marriage in the territories, disincorporating the [...] Church, and restricting the Church's ownership of property to fifty thousand dollars.\\"Gustive O. Larson, \\"Government, Politics, and Conflict\\" in Richard D. Poll et al., eds., Utah's History, 2d ed. (Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press, 1989),p. 244 The Mormons, believing that the law unconstitutionally deprived them of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to ignore this law at this time. In the following years, several bills aimed at strengthening the anti-bigamy laws failed to pass the United States Congress. These included the Wade, Cragin, and Cullom bills which had their origin in the Utah Territory and were initiated by men who were bitterly opposed to the Mormon curia. The Wade Bill initiated in 1866 would have destroyed local government if it had passed. Three years later the Cragin Bill was proposed, but within a few days it was substituted by the Cullom Bill, which was more radical than the Wade or Cragin bills. Members of the church worked for the defeat of the bill, including women of the church who held mass meetings throughout the territory in January 1870 in opposition to the bill.Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, 27th ed.

Cannon has this to say: \\"Brigham had no trouble in organizing at home a resistance to the Cullom bill, in which Gentiles, Godbeites, and orthodox Mormons stood side by side. The women of Utah made a special and particular protest. The fact that women in the state of Utah had the right to vote in 1870--one of only two places in the entire United States where women could vote at that time\\\\--gave the protests added weight and consideration. The influence of railroad and telegraph friends was also called upon to resist the bill. Whether more tangible means of persuasion were used cannot be affirmed though some of Brigham's allies and protectors of that day were no more above susceptibility to financial influence than Brigham was above using it. At any rate, the Cullom bill died of willful neglect, and the territory was free, for a time, from this direct and dangerous menace to its independence.\\"Frank J. Cannon and George L. Knapp, Brigham Young and his Mormon Empire, 1913, p. Immediate effects Under the Poland Act, jury lists were to be drawn by the district court clerk (a non-Mormon at the time) and the Probate Court judge (a Mormon) in order to give equal representation of members and nonmembers of the church on juries. Immediately the United States attorney tried to bring leading church officials to trial but experienced problems. Many of the leaders of the church had married before the law was passed in 1862 and could not be tried ex post facto. Furthermore, the wives could not be required to testify against their husbands, and the records of plural marriages were kept privately in the Endowment House. After U.S. Attorney William Carey promised to stop his attempts to indict general authorities during a test case to be brought before the United States Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of the anti-bigamy law, church leaders agreed to furnish a defendant. The First Presidency asked thirty-two-year-old George Reynolds, a secretary in the office of the President of the Church, who had recently married a second wife, to stand in for the church in the courts. Reynolds agreed to serve, then provided the attorney numerous witnesses who could testify of his being married to two wives, and was indicted for bigamy by a grand jury on October 23, 1874. When Carey did not keep his promise and arrested George Q. Cannon, church leaders decided that they would no longer cooperate with him.Larson, \\"Government, Politics, and Conflict,\\" pp. 252, 254. In 1875, Reynolds was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of five hundred dollars. In 1876 the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. His 1878 Reynolds v. United States appeal reached the United States Supreme Court, and in January 1879 that body ruled the anti-polygamy legislation constitutional and upheld Reynold's prison sentence (it struck down the fine and hard labor portions). Reynolds was released from prison in January 1881, having served eighteen months of his original sentence.Bruce A.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts at 2.25 kilowatts ERP from a tower in Kingston. Its studios are in Poughkeepsie, New York. From March 2006 to February 2020, WKXP's programming had been simulcasted on 97.3 WZAD Wurtsboro, New York. From January 3, 2020 to February 26, 2020, sister station, NOW 97.7 WCZX out of (Hyde Park) had been simulcasting WKXP's programming but is now simulcasting 97.3 WZAD's programming. The Thayer/Maxwell years The frequency signed on in 1965 as WGHQ-FM, sister to the Thayer family-owned WGHQ. For its first decade, it simulcasted the AM's programming by day and aired automated easy listening during hours when the AM was not on the air. In 1975, WGHQ-FM split off from the AM, changed to an automated Top 40 format, and changed its calls to WBPM (for World's Best Popular Music) . Several years after this switch, family patriarch Harry Thayer transferred the station to his stepson Walter Maxwell and wife Jean. By 1985, the station moved to totally local programming under the name B-94 and became a Kingston-centric alternative to the market-dominant WSPK. This arrangement worked for much of the next decade; however, around 1995, the station began to target Poughkeepsie, and adjusted its format to a Rhythmic Top 40 approach. Unlike most stations with such an approach, the rotation was peppered with obscure dance tracks and odd 80s gold; this rotation (mixed with the same jingles the station had used for the decade prior) led it to become a cult station among dance music fans. As the 1990s came to a close, the Maxwells were looking to get out of the radio business (as evidenced by how B-94 had few music adds, and was not replacing air staff, among other things). In early 1999, the Maxwells sold WBPM and WGHQ to Roberts Radio (owners of WRWD and WBWZ) and by that May, it was announced that WBPM would flip to the \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" format that was the rage at the time as Rhythm 94-3, with the flip taking place on June 10 of that year. WPKF can be seen as a semi-descendant of B-94 of sorts, the station possesses B-94's record library and morning DJ CJ Macintyre was the last DJ heard on B-94 before it left the format. Musical ownerships Unlike many other \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" stations, WBPM saw little increase to a small decrease in its ratings versus what B-94 had prior (meanwhile, WSPK became #1 by a considerable margin). In 2000, Roberts Radio sold its stations to Clear Channel Communications and the fallout from this deal had an interesting effect on WBPM. Clear Channel was also purchasing the Straus Media stations in the market and legally was one station over the limit in the market; however, ownership regulations at the time did allow them to control additional stations. As Clear Channel was known for doing at the time, WBPM (and WCKL in Catskill) was sold to Concord Media, a \\"shell\\" company that owned stations Clear Channel controlled via local marketing agreements. \\"Rhythm\\"'s ratings struggled further and by late 2001 the format was declared unsalvageable. On Thanksgiving weekend of that year, WBPM flipped to a satellite-fed oldies format as Cool 94.3. Existing in a glutted market for the format, this had no effect on their numbers even after established oldies outlet WCZX evolved out of the format to a '70s/'80s approach (and later to full-out adult contemporary). In late 2002, the FCC ordered that Clear Channel divest itself of associations to all \\"shell\\" companies, at which point Concord Media was disbanded. On February 28, 2003, Concord sold WBPM to Cumulus Media who took over the station the next day. With the takeover, the oldies format was relaunched as an all-local format with several former WCZX jocks on the air. This format, combined with New York Yankees baseball, propelled the station to its highest numbers since the B-94 days, however, this success was short-lived as an \\"anti-oldies\\" directive fired by group GM Chuck Benfer in the wake of aging demographics of the format. On October 3, the station went into a weekend of Christmas music stunting (minus Yankee games and a New York Giants football game) and relaunched at 9:43 AM on October 6 as Kicks 94.3, the WKXP calls having come a week prior. Country struggles Unfortunately for Cumulus, country has not been a success to date on the 94.3 frequency to date as the numbers plummeted from the one full book as oldies under Cumulus (not just overall, but in key demographics). The reasons for this can be debated; everything from poor management to signal and promotions versus WRWD to the probability that the Hudson Valley can truly support only one country station. One theory even cites the potential of a \\"top of the dial\\" bias for country music in the Hudson Valley given that WRWD, WGNA-FM in Albany, and the former Y-107 in Westchester County were all next to each other in the 107 MHz range and that any country not near that range has not succeeded. After the Spring 2005 Arbitron ratings showed the station having nearly no measurable audience outside of Yankee games, the station went to a harder-edged approach as The Wolf in Fall of 2005, adding WZAD to cover Orange County and the Catskills in March 2006. Late in the Summer of 2006, \\"The Wolf\\" added some country-sounding songs by non-country artists such as The Allman Brothers, Gordon Lightfoot, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Jewel, The Eagles, and other pop artists. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WKXP) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. On January 3, 2020, sister station Now 97.7 WCZX out of (Hyde Park) dropped its Hot AC format and announced that it would become part of, The Wolf simulcast to make a trimulcast to do competition with 107.3/99.3 WRWD-FM (Highland/Poughkeepsie)/WRWB-FM (Ellenville/Eastern Catskills).https://radioinsight.com/headlines/182905/wczx-joins-hudson- valleys-wolf-simulcast/ On February 26, 2020 at 12:00 PM, WKXP broke away from The Wolf country music format, and network and flipped to Soft AC as 94.3 Lite FM with the slogan Relaxing Favorites While You Work. The Lite FM branding was previously used in the Poughkeepsie market on 92.1 FM WRNQ from 2003 to 2014 when the station decided to go back to its previous branding as Q92.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/184733/townsquare-turns-on-the-lite-in- poughkeepsie/ See also References External links *94.3 Lite FM website * Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States KXP Category:Radio stations established in 1965 Category:1965 establishments in New York (state) Category:Townsquare Media radio stations ","title":"WKXP"},{"id":"4488342","text":"In cryptography the standard model is the model of computation in which the adversary is only limited by the amount of time and computational power available. Other names used are bare model and plain model. Cryptographic schemes are usually based on complexity assumptions, which state that some problems, such as factorization, cannot be solved in polynomial time. Schemes which can be proven secure using only complexity assumptions are said to be secure in the standard model. Security proofs are notoriously difficult to achieve in the standard model, so in many proofs, cryptographic primitives are replaced by idealized versions. The most common example of this technique, known as the random oracle model, involves replacing a cryptographic hash function with a genuinely random function. Another example is the generic group model, where the adversary is given access to a randomly chosen encoding of a group, instead of the finite field or elliptic curve groups used in practice. Other models used invoke trusted third parties to perform some task without cheating; for example, the public key infrastructure (PKI) model requires a certificate authority, which if it were dishonest, could produce fake certificates and use them to forge signatures, or mount a man in the middle attack to read encrypted messages. Other examples of this type are the common random string model, where it is assumed that all parties have access to some string chosen uniformly at random, and its generalization, the common reference string model, where a string is chosen according to some other probability distribution. These models are often used for non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZK). In some applications, such as the Dolev-Dwork- Naor encryption scheme, it makes sense for a particular party to generate the common reference string, while in other applications, the common reference string must be generated by a trusted third party. Collectively, these models are referred to as models with special setup assumptions.

Etymologically, Gur means wisdom and Mat means Tenet/Belief. Generally, Gurmat is theology includes teachings of Sikh Bhagats and Sikh Gurus which is incorporated in Guru Granth Sahib. It covers doctrinal, prescriptive and directional aspects of Sikh faith and praxis. Besides the basic theological structure, doctrine and tenets derived from the teachings of Guru Nanak and his nine successors, it refers to the whole Sikh way of life both in its individual and social expressions evolved over the centuries. Guidance received by Sikhs in their day-to-day affairs from institutions established by the Gurus and by the community nurtured upon their teachings will also fall within the frame of gurmat. In any exigency, the decision to be taken by the followers must conform to gurmat in its ideological and/or conventional assumptions.  Overview  Guru and God are considered the same. The 'guru' here in gur-mat means the Ten Gurus of the Sikh faith as well as gur-bani, i.e. their inspired utterances recorded in the Guru Granth Sahib. The instruction (mat) of the Guru implies the teaching imparted, and the example set by the Ten Gurus in person. Direction derived from these sources is a Sikh's ultimate norm in shaping the course of his life, both in its sacred and secular aspects. The spiritual path he is called upon to pursue should be oriented towards obtaining release, i.e. freedom from the dread bondage of repeated births and deaths, and standards of religious and personal conduct he must conform to in order to relate to his community and to society as a whole are all collectively subsumed in the concept of gurmat. Theologically, gurmat encompasses a strictly monotheistic belief. Faith in the Transcendent Being as the Supreme, indivisible reality without attributes is the first principle. The attributive-immanent nature of the Supreme Being is also accepted in Sikhism which posits power to create as one of the cardinal attributes of the Absolute or God of its conception. The Creator brought into being the universe by his hukam or Will, without any intermediaries. Man, as the pinnacle of creation, is born with a divine spark; his liberation lies in the recognition of his own spiritual essence and immanence of the Divine in the cosmic order. Fulfilment comes with the curbing of one's haumai or ego and cultivation of the discipline of nam, i.e. absorption in God's name, and of the humanitarian values of seva, selfless service to fellow men, love and tolerance. The way of life prescribed by gurmat postulates faith in the teachings of gurbani, perception of the Divine Will as the supreme law and honest performance of one's duties as a householder, an essential obligation. The first act suggested is prayer—prayer in the form of recitation by the individual of gurbani, thus participation in corporate service, or silent contemplation on the holy Word in one's solitude. Naam Japna, Kirat Karni and Wand kay Shako is the formula which succinctly sums up what is required of a Sikh: he must work to earn his living, share with others the fruit of his exertion, and practise remembrance of God's Name. Gurmat has evolved a tradition of observances and ceremonies for the Sikhs, mostly centred on the Holy Book, Guru Granth Sahib. Gurmat recognizes no priestly class as such. Any of the Sikhs admitted to the sangat may lead any of the services. He may lead prayers, perform the wedding ceremony known as Anand Karaj, and recite from the Guru Granth Sahib. The rites of passage, viz. ceremonies connected with the birth of a child, initiation, marriage and death, all take place in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib. They conclude with an ardas and the distribution of sacramental karahprasad. The recital of six stanzas from the Anand (lit. bliss) is well- nigh mandatory for all occasions, whether of joy or sorrow, wedding or death. On the ethical plane, gurmat prescribes a code of duties and moral virtues, coupled with the distinctive appearance made obligatory for the Khalsa. A Sikh becomes a full member of the Khalsa brotherhood after he has received the rites of initiation and the vows that go with it. Violation of any part of the code (particularly the four prohibitions) of the Khalsa is treated as disregard of gurmat and renders the offender guilty of apostasy. The tribunal of Sri Akal Takht at Amritsar has traditionally been regarded as Supreme in religious, social and secular affairs of the Sikhs and has the authority to issue edicts for providing guidance to the Panth as a whole and to excommunicate any individual who has acted contrary to its interests or who has been found guilty of attempting to overturn any established Sikh religious convention. Directional injunctions under gurmat can be issued to individuals or communities by Panj Piare, the five elect ones. They will provide solution to problems that arise or problems brought before them. Or, one 'consults' the Guru by presenting oneself before the Guru Granth Sahib to obtain in moments of perplexity his (the Guru's) guidance which comes in the form of the sabda, i.e. hymn or stanza, that first meets the eye at the top of left-hand page as the Holy Book is opened at random. There are instances also of the community leaders deciding on a course of action through recourse to such consultation. The institution of gurmata (sacred resolution), unanimous decision taken or consensus arrived at in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib, dates back to the early eighteenth century. Some of the conventions and customs established to resolve lingering controversies have become part of gurmat. In regard to the wedding ceremony for instance, the custom of Anand Karaj has gained universal acceptance which was not the case until the beginning of the twentieth century: any other form of the ritual will not have the sanction of gurmat today. The use of intoxicants and eating meat is prohibited. Casteism and untouchability are ruled out in principle; any vestiges of it such as use of caste-names as surnames are generally considered against gurmat. The 48-hour- long uninterrupted recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, called Akhand Path, has over the decades come to be accepted as part of the Sikh way of life. Gurmat does not approve of renunciation. It insists, on the other hand, on active participation in life. Human existence, according to Sikh belief, affords one a rare opportunity for self-transcendence through cognizing and contemplating on the Name and through deeds of selfless service. One rehearses the qualities of humility, compassion and fraternal love best while living in the world. A householder who works to earn his living and is yet willing to share with others the fruit of his exertion and who cherishes ever God in his heart is, according to gurmat, the ideal man. Even as reverence for the pious and the saintly is regarded desirable, parasitism is forbidden in gurmat. The cultivation of the values of character and of finer tastes in life is commended. The writings of the Gurus preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib and the Dasam Granth best interpret and elucidate what gurmat is. Some anecdotes recorded in the Janam Sakhis also help explain gurmat principles. A systematic exposition of gurmat principles was for the first time undertaken by Bhai Gurdas (d. 1636), who in his Varan expatiated upon terms such as gurmukh, one attuned to the Gurus' teaching, sangat, fellowship of the holy, and seva, humble acts of service in the cause of the community and of fellow men in general, besides evolving a framework for the exegetics of gurbani. The process of exposition, continued by men of learning such as Baba Miharban (1581–1640), Bhai Mani Singh (d.1737) and Bhai Santokh Singh (1787–1843) and by the writers of Rahitnama literature reached its culmination in the Singh Sabha movement which produced interpreters of the calibre of Bhai Kahn Singh (1861–1938), Bhai Vir Singh (1872–1957) and Bhai Jodh Singh (1882 1981). Above extract from www.atammargonline.org Note: gurmat does not believe in a cycle of birth and death after death, and gurmat does not believe in any heaven and hell after death. Gurmat has a mission to make this world heaven. References #Kahn Singh, Bhai, Gurmat Martand. Amritsar, 1962 #Jodh Singh, Bhai, Gurmat Nirnaya.

The movement was founded in 1970 by the Arab insurgent leader Mohamed Baghlani, who had been expelled in June from the FROLINAT by the organization's secretary-general Abba Siddick. The new group was of islamist tendency and was mainly composed of Arabs who shunned Siddick's leadership of the FROLINAT; it was based in Libya. For several years, till about 1975, the Volcan Army was a negligible force on the ground; after that it started slowly expanding. Among the new members arrived in 1976 Ahmat Acyl who attacked Baghlani's authority with the support of Libya in January 1977; and when Baghlani died in a car accident in Benghazi on March 27, Acyl became the new leader of the militia with the full support of the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, of whom Acyl was to become his most loyal man in Chad. Under Acyl's leadership the group rapidly expanded, coordinating its activities with Oueddei Goukouni's larger People's Armed Forces (FAP) in the prefectures of Biltine and Salamat. While remaining much fewer in numbers than both the FAP and the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), its 400-500 men were reputed to be among the most resolute fighters of the insurgency. Its expansion represented the participation in the civil war of the populations of central Chad, especially of the major Arab bedouin tribes. The Volcan Army was often accused of tribalism, with its deep suspicion for the zuruq, the blacks, and in particular for the Gorane (i.e. Toubou) which dominated the FAP and FAN. These suspicions erupted in the summer of 1978 when the Volcan forces attacked, sobilliated by Qaddafi, the FAP's positions at Faya-Largeau, but were easily repelled. Since the Volcan Army had become by the first months of the year the group most heavily supported by Libya, Goukouni readily understood that the Libyans were behind the acretaliated by breaking all ties with Qaddafi. Relations between Acyl and Goukouni were still frosty in 1979, when Goukouni temporarily allied himself with Hissène Habré in February during the battle of N'Djamena, in which the southern-dominated government disintegrated. The international community, led by Nigeria, tried to bring order to the expanding chaos in Chad through a series of international peace conferences. But the first peace conference held in March excluded minor factions, like the Volcan Army; as a reaction they created the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), a counter-government supported by Libya and opposed to the new Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT). As the first compromise proposals failed, the FACP swiftly renamed itself Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR), and assumed as its leader Ahmat Acyl. By this moment the Volcan Army was to be known as the CDR.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared in the United States in the March 1931 issue of Cosmopolitan (as \\"Sales Resistance\\"), and in the United Kingdom in the August 1931 Strand. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68–69, A53. Plot Freddie Threepwood, still trying to persuade his Aunt Georgiana of the benefits of Donaldson's Dog-Joy (even going so far as to act out the phrase \\"eating one's own dog food\\") hears that his cousin Gertrude has become infatuated with Orlo Watkins, a weedy tenor invited to the castle by Lady Constance. While visiting his friend Beefy Bingham to borrow his dog Bottles, Freddie learns that she has indeed all but \\"handed him the bird\\". Freddie tells this to Lady Georgiana, while giving a rather poor demonstration of Dog-Joy's powers, during which Bottles is scared off by Susan, one of Lady Georgiana's Pekes. He later tries to reason with his cousin, but to no avail; the glamour of the singer has taken her over. That evening, while the household take after-dinner coffee in the drawing room, Freddie enters with Bottles and a sack of rats, intending to demonstrate the Dog-Joy reared mongrel's ratcatching prowess; Orlo Watkins, observed by Gertrude, cringes somewhat at the sight. The family protest, and Beach is called to take the bag of rats away. Bottles remains, however, and when one of Lady Georgiana's Airedales comes in, a mighty battle commences. Watkins, to Gertrude's disgust, leaps atop a display cabinet, while the others dither about. Just in time, Bingham enters, sees the fight in progress, and breaks it up by the simple expedient of taking one dog in each massive hand and pulling. His manly display shakes the scales from Gertrude's eyes, and she falls into his arms, while Watkins slinks off, defeated. Lady Georgiana, meanwhile, is so impressed by Bottles' performance that she orders two tons of Dog-Joy off Freddie.

Kolkata is connected to the rest of India by the National Highways, the extensive network of the Indian Railways, and by air. Most traffic to North-East India routes via Kolkata. Roads Howrah Bridge and Vidyasagar Setu are two bridges connecting Kolkata with Howrah over the Ganges. Vivekananda Setu is the third bridge over the river at the northern reach of the city near Dakshineshwar from Howrah. The fourth one and the newest one is Nivedita Setu. Since Kolkata suffers from traffic congestion like other Indian cities, a network of expressways like Kona Expressway and Belghoria Expressway, flyovers and widening of southern stretch of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass are being created to ease up road traffic. Kolkata is connected to other parts of India by the National Highways 2, 6, 34 and 117. The Belghoria Expressway connects NH 34 with NH 2 and 6 via the Nivedita Setu while the NH 117 is connected to NH 6 by the Kona Expressway via the Vidyasagar Setu.

Two divisions of the Indian railways - the Eastern Railway and the South Eastern Railway are headquartered in the city. The two major railway stations of the city are at Howrah and Sealdah. A third terminal called Kolkata has recently been constructed. This station is in North Kolkata and can be reached by a road opposite to the RG Kar Medical College just beyond Shyambazar. The electrified suburban rail network of the SER and the ER is extensive and stretches far into the neighbouring districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Nadia, Howrah, Hooghly, Purba Medinipur and parts of Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Medinipur, Murshidabad. The Circular Rail encircles the entire city of Kolkata. However, the poorly-patronized branch line between Dum Dum Cantonment railway station and Biman Bandar railway station is now replaced by Line 4 (under construction) of the Kolkata Metro. Metro Railway A metro train leaving the Dum Dum metro stationalt= Kolkata was the first city in South Asia to have an underground railway system that started operating from 1984. It is considered to have the status of a zonal railway. It is run by the Indian Railways. The Metro is a very well maintained and clean system. The existing Kolkata metro line is mostly underground which makes it different from Delhi Metro and Bangalore Metro (Namma Metro) which are mostly overground. The line begins at Noapara in the north and continues south through Esplanade in the heart of the city till the southern end in New Garia. There are new metro lines being built to serve other parts of Kolkata, including an East West corridor (Line 2) linking Howrah Maidan to Salt Lake Sector 5 through Sealdah. Its Construction has started after being halted due to a legal issue. Other lines being constructed are Line 3 Esplanade - Behala - Joka area, Line 1 Extension Noapara - Dakhineshwar area, Line 4 Noapara - Dumdum Airport - Barasat area and Line 6 New Garia - EM Bypass - Saltlake - Rajarhat Newtown - Dumdum Airport area. Some extensions are also planned. Trains run every 5–15 minutes from 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and from 09:50 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Sunday. Fares are between Rs 10-30. The Kolkata Metro, though not as modern as its Indian counterparts, has commendable reviews due to its service, citing various helpful factors like the cheapness of the ticket, cleanliness and other facilities. Howrah Maidan to salt lake sector v (East- West metro) is the most advanced metro system in India and also the first Underwater metro in India. Buses Esplanade Bus StationKolkata has an extensive network of government run and privately run buses. The ticketing system is not centralized one and one has to purchase separate tickets for buses, metros, trains. Online ticketing and smart card facilities are available. The bus tickets are simple paper tickets purchased from the bus conductor after you board the bus. Also there are multiple organisations running buses, a private organisation, and multiple government services like CSTC (Calcutta State Transport Corporation), CTC (Calcutta Tramways Company), WBSTC (West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation) etc (now these government bus-companies are merged under West Bengal Transport Corporation). There are also various types of privately-run buses. The private-owned buses are quite typical of Kolkata. The private-owned buses are of two types, the regular ones and the mini-buses. The regular buses are coloured light-blue and yellow. The mini-buses are of brown and yellow colour and contain lesser number of seats. The mini-buses were started in the late seventies as a relief for the office commuters from the overloaded buses by being a sitting-only service, but this has given way to severely overloaded and crowded mini buses (and other buses too), largely due to the massive population of Kolkata.Gupta, Jayanta. \\"Roads Under Siege, Metro Runs Beyond Capacity.\\" The Times of India. Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. 28 Sept. 2012. Web. 21 Oct. 2012. The government-run buses are run by several authorities like West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC), South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC), North Bengal State Transport Corporation (NBSTC). Government buses are generally painted cobalt blue colour, with white stripes and can be also identified by the WBTC symbol on their body. Usually these buses are either bigger buses. Both the name of the place where the bus is going to, as well as the name of the place where its route originated is mentioned on the bus, digitally or written. On the Route Board of the Private/Mini Buses, the ply through (via) stoppages are also mentioned. Recently larger & longer buses have been introduced under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). These buses are superior and they have LED display boards which show the route, source & destination and also the popular bus stops. Further, usually the conductor will call out the names of the stops to come at each halt, so boarding the right bus is not much of a trouble. If in doubt the conductor or any fellow passenger will help out. The buses will often stop to pick up a passenger who waves at the bus.An AC Volvo bus of WBSTC Air-conditioned buses have been introduced by the WBSTC & CSTC (now under WBTC). Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) these buses have been included as a part of travel comfort to commuters. Air-conditioned buses are operated by WBSTC directly & through outsourcing. These buses are served by Tata Marcopolo Buses and Volvo Low Floor Buses. Air conditioned buses were launched as of July 2014 by CSTC on different routes across the city and suburbs. They are in blue and white livery and is a complete fleet of Volvo 8400 model & Ashok Leyland AC JanBus, bought under JNNURM scheme. AC buses are also operated under CTC (now WBTC). Around 450 JanBus, world's first, has been launched from 30 July 2014. These buses have been manufactured by Ashok Leyland Long distance buses starting from Kolkata to various places like Bakkhali, Digha, Siliguri and other cities originate from the central bus depot at Dharmatala (popularly known as Esplanade) and Howrah bus stand. The tickets can be purchased on spot from the counters, online ticket booking websites or from the conductor on the bus. In 2019 electric AC buses were introduced. Tata motors were given contract of supplying 80 such buses to the city. The fares for the electric buses is the same as that of AC Volvo buses — Rs 25 for the first four kilometres. But the ride is smoother. Taxis The metered-cabs are mostly of the brand \\"Ambassador\\" manufactured by Hindustan Motors (now out of production). Once in a while, one or two Maruti Omnis, and Tata Indigo CS can be seen painted in yellow. The Meter Taxi/Cab Rates of Kolkata and Howrah have changed and new rates are applicable from 11 June 2018. From December 2013 all taxis in Kolkata should be having a calibrated electronic meter, where the passenger has to pay the exact value flashed on the meter. The minimum value is Rs.30 for first 2 km . This value gets flashed on the meter when one hires a cab. The yellow cabs are all non air conditioned and can be identified by its yellow livery and a glow light on top referring as taxi. From December 2013, a new fleet of no-refusal taxis had started to ply. Most of these taxis are air conditioned (except the last produced batch of Ambassador) and are in white livery with a blue strip and ac taxi/taxi mentioned on front left door. The fare is same as in that of yellow taxis (same rate as flashed on the meter), except if driven with ac turned on, the passenger has to pay 25% on the displayed fare.

File:India - Kolkata rainy street - 3819.jpg|alt=Kolkata Taxi|Kolkata taxis File:Yellowtaxi2.jpg|Kolkata taxi near Park street File:Kolkata yellow taxi1.jpg|Kolkata is unique for the plentiful presence of the vintage yellow taxi Tram SLC-type tram, running on Route 14, entering the B.B.D. Bagh terminus Kolkata is the only city in India to have a tram network. Trams are under the administration of the Calcutta Tramways Company, a government of West Bengal Undertaking, popularly called CTC (now merged with West Bengal Transport Corporation). The environment-friendliness and the age-old charm of the trams attract some people. The tram lines, laid in some major roads, are now renovated to place the tram lines on the same level plane as the rest of the road, thereby smoothening the road. In places, the original central boulevards reserved only for the trams have been removed; the tram-lines are thus brought in the same plane as that of the road. The usable space of the road for vehicle movement has thereby considerably increased. With embedding of tram tracks in the road surface, the overall surface has become smoother, easing the traffic to some extent. Tram in Kolkata With the tracks now running in the centre of the heavy traffic roads, commuters are encountering difficulties in getting to the trams' stops through the traffic and as a result, fewer people are able to use the tram . Mostly trams are found to be running with many seats vacant even during rush hours. This has also caused reduction of revenue for Calcutta Tram Company. One possible remedy towards difficulty of approach-ability to the trams could be to relay the tracks on left and the right sides of the road, adjacent to the footpaths. However, relaying the track may not be possible now as the modification will need enormous expenditure. Moreover, in many thoroughfares one flank of the road is used for parking cars on payment of fee. Thereby generating revenue to the government as well as providing space for car parking. Hence, relaying tram tracks on the side of the road may not be feasible. Though trams are environment friendly, the main drawbacks of tram are that they are slow moving and occupy a lot of road space which itself is less in Kolkata. In case of derailment or breakdown of a tram the entire road gets obstructed. It will be better to keep trams in only some roads where problem of traffic jams are expected to be less. The solution to this would be to improve the maintenance of the trams as well as the support of local traffic sergeants. Signals can be modified to stop when a tram is coming, for its easy passage. Also, tram tracks should be demarcated with a small but sturdy demarcation, which will enable bikes to traverse when there are no trams. Now, several initiatives have started to improve the tram's popularity as well as increasing revenues. The results are positive. The Tram Museum is the latest addition to such schemes, which also include heritage trams' small models and meals on wheels trams i.e. with dining options. 1st AC passenger tram ran in the city in 2019. Each of the AC trams, built at the Nonapukur tram depot near Ripon Street, cost Rs 25 lakh and is fitted with a 5.5 tonne AC unit, LED light bulbs and fans. Light railway The proposal for a light rail transit system on elevated tracks for Kolkata is being pursued by the Government of West Bengal, but it is still on the drawing board. Monorail Like light rail, a monorail system has been proposed in Kolkata; however, plans to construct it haven't been materialised yet. Rickshaws and auto-rickshaws A human-pulled Rickshaw Rickshaws pulled by women aged 22 and auto rickshaws are commonplace. Many migrants from Bihar and rural Bengal are involved in rickshaw pulling. In southern Kolkata, the rickshaws pulled by men have been replaced by cycle rickshaws. Fares are usually set by the rickshaw unions. These rickshaws usually operate over short distances due to the manual effort involved, and mainly run on narrow lanes where buses and auto-rickshaws don't ply. These Rickshaws are not allowed to ply over main roads of Kolkata. Hand pulled rickshaws are mainly found in old localities of North Kolkata and some old localities of South Kolkata. Moreover, Cycle rickshaws are also a common transport in many localities of kolkata. They also ply on narrow lanes and not allowed to ply over main roads. Auto-rickshaws have become a very common mode of transport for short distances. They are usually not metered, and are usually shared. There are several routes, and the auto-rickshaws of a particular route ply between two distinct places of that route only. Autorickshaws can accommodate three people in the backseat, and one passenger in front beside the driver legally. The fares are usually quite low compared to other metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai, the minimum fare being ₹8. Unlike other metros the autorickshaws do not run on a fare meter. The auto rickshaws are not allowed in major arterial roads and certain part of the city. Airport Cityside view of the new Integrated Terminal of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport The Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport (IATA code:CCU) at Dum Dum (previously known as Dum Dum airport) is the only airport in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, operating both domestic and international flights. It is a gateway to North-East India, Bangkok, and Bangladesh. The number of people using the airport has consistently increased over the last few years. There is a flying club in Behala. After several years of inactivity it has recently been restored. Port and water transport Kolkata is also a major port and together with the Haldia dock systems, the Kolkata Port Trust has been amongst top performers in the country. Kolkata Port has regular passenger services to Port Blair from the Netaji Subhas Docks. Also the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah are connected by local water ferries through the extensive ghats like Fairlie Ghat, Howrah Ghat, Shibpur Ghat, Prinsep Ghat, Cossipore Ghat, etc. Small boats are used for recreational purpose. There are plans to start utilizing the canals running through the city as water-transport network. The first service was scheduled to start from September 2016 - and would have covered the Belgachia-Lake Town stretch of Kestopur Canal but the plan never came to reality. Besides all this mode of transport, like in other Indian cities, walking is very common way to commute between the workplace and nearest railway station or bus stop. Privately owned cars, though less in number and usage compared to other large cities in India, are growing by leaps and bounds and are slowly becoming the transport of choice for a large number of people being helped by the growing economy, higher per capita income and the easy availability of loans from financial institutions.

Heritage is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange since 1999. In 2008, Heritage listed on the London Stock Exchange.http://www.heritageoilplc.com/resource/Heritage_Dealings_%20Commence_on_LSE_31_March.pdf Buckingham's direct and indirect share holding is estimated to represent 33% of Heritage. This share was reduced in November 2007 via a share placement made through JP Morgan and Canaccord. According to the Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Buckingham is worth £425 million.  Private military background  Buckingham is a former partner of the private military company Executive Outcomes.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/who-is-tony-buckingham-and-why- does-everyone-want-to-talk-to-him-1159724.html A top-secret British intelligence report stated that \\"Executive Outcomes was registered in the UK on September 1993 by Anthony (Tony) Buckingham, a British businessman and Simon Mann, a former British officer\\". Buckingham denies that he registered Executive Outcomes in London and consistently denies any \\"corporate ties\\" to the defunct organisation. Tony, along with founder and CEO of Executive Outcomes, Eeben Barlow, Deputy CEO Lafras Luitingh and Simon Mann were the executive officers of Ibis Air, a separate partner company that was the aircraft procurement organisation that owned and operated many aircraft for EO and essentially operated as their private air force. Ibis Air could also access Soviet-era fighters and strike aircraft from the Angolan Air Force. He has had no involvement with such organizations since 1999 and has spent his time running Heritage Oil of which he is the founder and former CEO. He was appointed to the board of directors in early 2008, coinciding with the company's listing on the London Stock Exchange. He was part of the Valentine Strasser coup in Sierra Leone and was part of a group of mercenaries defending the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), which later collapsed. To this day his name is still linked to these events and the fall of the government.http://www.newstatesman.com/africa/2012/01/sierra-leone-strasser- war  Oil background  Buckingham, the former CEO and major shareholder of Heritage, has led the company through exploration finds, including the hydrocarbon system in Lake Albert, Uganda and the M’Boundi oilfield in the Republic of Congo. There are recently awarded licenses in the Iraqi Kurdistan and Mali. Heritage Oil's subsidiary, Heritage Oil and Gas, drew attention in the 2016 publication of the Panama Papers. Emails among the Panama Papers documents showed how Heritage Oil and Gas Ltd re-domiciled itself to avoid paying $400m (£280m) in capital gains Tax to the Ugandan government. DiamondWorks Anthony Buckingham became the controlling shareholder and director of DiamondWorks when DiamondWorks' acquired a private company, Branch Energy Ltd., based on the Isle of Man for US$24.4-million in 1995-6. Branch Energy Ltd had a mining lease on the diamond-bearing Koidu property in Sierra Leone. In the early 1990s Buckingham's military consultancy was retained by Sierra Leone and Angola to provide mercenaries to improve security conditions for foreign mining companies. His Executive Outcomes (EO) provided protection to DiamondWorks. Executive Outcomes (EO) and DiamondWorks shared offices in London with Sandline International, another military consultancy. London- headquartered, Johannesburg-based diamond exploration company DiamondWorks Ltd. (TSX: DMW) was one of three junior mining firms that traded on Canadian stock exchanges, (along with Toronto-based AmCan Minerals and Rex Diamond) that contacted Sierra Leone President Joseph Saidu Momoh in the early 1990s when the president was seeking new investors. DiamondWorks was \\"an outgrowth of Carson Gold and Vengold, companies promoted by Eric and Robert Friedland. DiamondWorks and Branch Energy became \\"the subject of widespread interest because of their apparent but much-denied connections with two major international security firms, Executive Outcomes and Sandline.\\" It has been argued that \\"regardless of Executive Outcome’s own purpose, its involvement in Sierra Leone was in a good cause. EO successfully protected a democratically elected government against a brutal and illegitimate rebel force.\\" Buckingham resigned from DiamondWorks in 1998, retaining a 25 per cent share.

In common usage, the term stands for excessive passion for sexual pleasure and it is in this sense that it is considered to be an evil in Sikhism. In Sikhism it is believed that Kaam can be overcome by being satisfied with the current moment. All 5 thieves can be overcome with selfless service and remembrance of God (Simran).  Sikh Guru teachings  The Gurus rejected lust. Yet they recognized the four purusarthas, referred to in Gurbani as char Padaraths or the four human pursuits as the Granth Sahib declares \\"Dharma, Artha, Kam and Moksha follow God's devotee like shadow\\" (SGGS 1320). However, in Sikhism, Kam is not unrestricted gratification of carnal desires, but an impulse which needs to be kept under check like other impulses and passions. Unrestrained propensity towards Kam, especially sexual relationship outside the marital bond, is condemned in the strongest terms in Sikh codes of conduct as well as in the Scripture. It is a destructive evil and a deadly sin. Kam is heavily discouraged as it \\"can build barriers against God in their lives\\".http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml To quote Guru Arjan, Nanak V: \\"O Kam, thou landest people in hell and makest them wander through many births, enticest all minds, swayest all the three worlds and undoest one's meditation, austerities and restraint. The pleasure is ephemeral and thou afflictest high and low alike\\" (GG, 1358). Guru Tegh Bahadur Nanak IX, says: \\"In the sinning heart reigns kam and the fickle mind breaks out of control. Kam casts its noose even upon yogis, jangams and sannyasis. Only those imbued with God's Name (fall not a prey to it) and are able to go across the ocean of existence\\" (GG, 1186). Bhai Gurdas describes an ideal Sikh as one who is loyal to his wife and \\"regards all other women as mothers, sisters and daughters\\" (Varan, XXIX. 11). Guru Gobind Singh also said: \\"Love your own wedded wife ever so more, but do not go to another woman's bed even in a dream.\\" Sikh codes of conduct strictly prohibit extramarital relations. While prescribing self-control and restraint and not total annihilation of kam, the Gurus suggested two ways of channelizing and sublimating it. On the one hand, they pronounced grihastha or married life to be the ideal one, and, on the other laid down love of God and absorption in His Name as the essential principle of spiritual discipline. Says Guru Gobind Singh \\"Hear ye all, I proclaim here the truth: only they who love God find Him.\\" The image of a devotee most common in Sikh Scripture is one of a wife deeply in love with her husband presently separated from him, and waiting, craving, praying for a reunion with him. Such fervent devotion cannot but bridle the wayward passion in man. According to Guru Arjan, a person who has cultivated the love of the Lord’s feet would desire neither kingship, worldly power, or even mukti or liberation (GG 534).

Focusing on a team of superheroes of the same name, it was published by Wildstorm comics, then still a part of Image Comics, as a continuation of the series Backlash. After the series was canceled, the team's final story was told in the pages of Gen- Active, an anthology series. History The story of Wildcore starts in the pages of Backlash, where Marc Slayton (aka Backlash) and his girlfriend Amanda Reed (aka Taboo) work with the U.S. government's secret organization Department PSI. Slayton had collected a group of superhuman agents to assist him in his missions, but at the beginning of Wildcore, many of these agents have left or are reassigned. As a replacement, Wildcore is formed to combat the alien D'rahn. The D'rahn are an ancient enemy of the Kherubim and Daemonites, who have appeared again after millennia of absence and are planning on taking over the world and the galaxy. The D'rahn claim the Kherubim, their former allies, betrayed them and therefore want revenge on the Kherubim first and foremost. Backlash, being half-Kherubim, and Ferrian, a full-blood Kherubim, are both members of Wildcore, making Wildcore a primary target for the D'rahn. Department PSI-director Antonio Giovanni also hires Zealot, another Kherubim, who has experience fighting the D'rahn. Zealot is sent to infiltrate the Norfolk Naval base, where General Gant resides. Gant, as the leader of the Puritans (a group of humans who plan on eliminating all aliens on Earth), has a list with all suspected aliens on Earth. The D'rahn plan on obtaining the list so they can locate and strike against the remaining Kherubim on Earth. The Norfolk Naval base is protected by the Chasers, a group of superhumans, but when the D'rahn attack, the Chasers turn out to be no match for them. Zealot, Gant, and the Chaser leader Brawl survive the D'rahn's initial attack, but it turns out that Gant is a Daemonite. Gant and his Daemonites make a deal with the D'rahn: they will serve the D'rahn and, in return, the D'rahn will spare them. The D'rahn then reveal their special ability, Enlightenment, which allows them to change a being into a more powerful version. The D'rahn enlighten Gant's Daemonites. Wildcore is sent in and they manage to delete most of the list, but ten names remain on it. Brawl joins Wildcore and the team sets out to protect the names on the list. On the offensive The first target is Guy Blackfoot, but Wildcore is too late. Blackfoot is killed and one of the D'rahn enlightens his fiancé Alea, changing her into a superhuman. Meanwhile, Zealot and Ferrian ask Mister Majestic for assistance against the D'rahn. It is also revealed that the mage Azrum, part of Backlash's former group in Department PSI, was asked by Giovanni to seek out the witch Tapestry, hoping to use her magic against the D'rahn. Azrum hasn't contacted them since, so Wildcore decides to go on the offensive; Department PSI has located the D'rahn's base and Wildcore attacks. They are joined by Majestic and he kills the D'rahn's leader, Typhon. The D'rahn retreat to regroup. Wildcore goes to investigate Azrum's disappearance and find that Tapestry has captured him. Tapestry uses her magic to enslave Zealot and wants to reshape the world in her image. The other Wildcore members manage to interfere with the spell. Wildcore and Tapestry are now on a medieval fantasy-type world and no longer remember their past. Only Ferrian manages to regain his memory and he gathers his former team to oppose Tapestry. They succeed and return to Earth, but Styrian is killed and Geist follows them back to Earth. Zealot leaves the team shortly afterward. Final mission Wildcore assists in the worldwide emergency caused by Jacob Krigstein's super- powered agents attacking the world's major capitals.The Authority vol. 1 #16 (August 2000) Geist eventually joined Wildcore and Alea became an active member. Wildcore was sent to Antarctica to quell a riot in Purgatory Maximum Security Penitentiary, nicknamed Purgatory Max, a prison for dangerous superhumans.Gen-Active #4 (February 2001) Supervillain Baron Tödt (see notes) and his group, the Axis, had entered the prison, killed all personnel and released all prisoners. Wildcore entered the prison, separating along the way. The inmates proceeded to overpower the separated Wildcore members, seemingly killing most of them. Taboo was saved by inmate Hangman, a prisoner seeking salvation. He warned her that the prison is about to explode. Backlash found the explosives a second before they detonated, and was caught in the blast, resulting in the loss of his left leg. Another inmate, former DV8 member Evo, who had been Hangman's cellmate, saved Backlash and took him outside. Being severely injured, Evo, Backlash and Taboo three collapsed outside the prison. Hangman congratulated Evo on doing the right thing, activated Backlash's beacon, and left. Department PSI arrived and found five bodies, telling his subordinates to take them back to a hospital and that all others must have died. (see notes) While Marc convalesced at a hospital, Jodi Slayton, his daughter, who had become the super-hero known as Jet, decides to avenge her father by looking for the individuals involved in the riot and capturing them, spending months fighting criminals and searching for clues.Gen-Active #6 (August 2001) Midnighter was asked to do the same by former Stormwatch member Jackson King and assists Jet for a while, but allows her to handle things herself as she wishes. Marc eventually recovered from the ordeal, gaining a cybernetic leg, replacing his severed leg.Point Blank #2 (November 2002) Characters *Backlash (Marc Slayton): leader of Wildcore, Colonel Marc Slayton is half-Kherubim/half-human and has been active as a warrior and superhero for centuries, even though he couldn't remember most of it. Backlash can generate whips made of energy and turn himself into mist. *Taboo (Amanda Reed): Marc's girlfriend, Taboo gains her powers from a vampiric, symbiotic costume grafted to her body. The costume allows her to fly, increases her strength and durability, and gives her psionic powers. *Zealot (Zannah): A Kherubim warrior and former WildC.A.Ts member, Zealot joined to stop the D'rahn but left the team before the Purgatory Max mission and returned to the WildC.A.Ts. As she was hired by Giovanni without Slayton's consent, there were frequent clashes between Backlash and Zealot on matters of leadership. *Ferrian: Another Kherubim, Ferrian was Marc Slayton's guardian during his youth. Highly intelligent, Ferrian serves as the team's strategist. He is also a capable warrior and has psychometric powers. *Vigor (Richard Vincent): An archaeologist and friend of Ferrian. Vigor has limitless stamina and can fire energy blasts from a gem he wears on his forehead. *Brawl: former leader of the Chasers, Brawl joined Wildcore to avenge his teammates' death at the hands of the D'rahn. Brawl has superhuman strength and durability. *Styrian (Omar Kamadev): The son of Antonio Giovanni's best friend, Styrian was placed on the team without Backlash knowing anything about him. Styrian had a romantic relationship with Jodi, Slayton's daughter, which caused some tension between the two, but Styrian died saving Backlash. Styrian could fly and control the weather. *Alea (last name unknown): Fiancé of D'rahn victim Guy Blackfoot, Alea was changed into a superhuman being by the D'rahn Pildra, who intended to use her as a Trojan horse. Alea was part of Wildcore but was still training during most missions. She was with the team on the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission. Her skin was changed into a ruby-like substance, giving her superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to absorb and re-emit energy. *Geist: Taboo's lover on Tapestry's world, he secretly followed her to Earth. Unable to handle Taboo's change in personality and to a human, he lashed out in anger against Wildcore but was defeated. Geist was with the team for the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission. Geist had the ability to blend into the background. He also displayed incredible agility and fighting skills. *Azrum: A powerful mage, Azrum initially wasn't part of Wildcore, but he was sent to find Tapestry as the D'rahn had no defense against magic. He was with the team for the Purgatory Max mission and was killed during the mission. *Crimson/Jet (Jodi Slayton): Though officially not a member of Wildcore, Jodi went on most missions with them. She had a relationship with Styrian and was shocked by his death. She left Department PSI and changed her name to Jet. *Antonio Giovanni, head of Department PSI. Notes * Only Evo, Backlash, and Taboo are seen on- panel as survivors when Hangman disappears. Department PSI finds five bodies though, so two other Wildcore members may have survived. These two others are not Azrum, Geist, or Alea, as one of Giovanni's men asks about them. Except for Backlash, none of the other members have been seen since.

The system requires candidates be selected by a nominating commission and therefore plays a significant role in the selection of the state's judiciary. It is largely patterned after the Missouri Plan, and an earlier version in Tennessee was called the Modified Missouri Plan. The Tennessee Plan provides that appellate court vacancies must be filled by one of three nominees submitted and approved by the governor of Tennessee from a panel.http://www.tncourts.gov/boards-commissions/boards-commissions/judicial- nominating-commission At the next general election and at the end of every eight-year term, voters' input is limited to deciding whether each judge shall be retained through a yes-no election. This system applies to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. The next regular election for state judges will be in August 2022. In November 2014 a referendum on formally adopting the Tennessee Plan as an amendment to the Tennessee Constitution, clarifying its status, was held, and the Plan's provisions were formally added to the Constitution, modified only slightly in that the governor can now select his own nominees to the courts without the input from a commission, and that nominees must be confirmed or disapparoved by the General Assembly, which must vote whether to do so within 60 days of the nominee's selection if it is in session, and within 60 days of the convening of the next session if it is not in session at the time of the appointment, and if no vote is taken within this deadline, the nominees are considered to have been confirmed by default. The appointment-by- default procedure is similar to the system used in Mexico. There, for the appointment of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Mexico, the President of Mexico submits a list of three candidates to the Senate. The Senate has thirty (30) days within which to choose one of the candidates. If the Senate does not decide within that period, the President chooses one of the nominees. If the Senate rejects all three nominees, the President is required to submit a new list of three. If the Senate rejects the second list, the President chooses one of the nominees on the second list.Mex. Const. § 96 Process Until the ratification of the constitutional amendment in 2014, when a vacancy occurred, the Judicial Nominating Commission accepted applications from any qualified Tennessee lawyer. Typical qualifications include age, residency, and proper professional standing. The commission then chose three nominees from the applications received. The commission submitted these three nominees—altogether called a panel—to the governor of Tennessee. Residency qualifications included not only state citizenship, but also citizenship within a particular Grand Division. If the governor rejected the entire panel, the commission had to submit another panel. When this occurred, the governor was compelled to choose a nominee from the second panel. No one who was on a rejected panel of nominees can be on the second panel. This process effectively guaranteed that one of six of the nominees chosen by the 17 members of the Nominating Commission must become a judge. The Judicial Nominating Commission was composed of 17 unelected members, with explicit requirements that the majority be lawyers. Once chosen by the governor, the judge took his/her seat. At the first statewide general election following his or her appointment the person's name is placed before the public on the ballot on a simple yes-no basis, e.g., \\"Shall Jon R. Smith be elected and retained as Judge, Court of Criminal Appeals, for Middle Tennessee?\\" If a majority of voters decides this question in the negative, the process outlined above starts over. Every eight years (1998, 2006, 2014, 2022, et seq.), all members of all of the state appellate courts are subjected to this process as well. All judges are elected statewide, not just in the Grand Division from which they are appointed. In 2006, all judges submitted for approval received an affirmative vote of at least 70 percent.The names of all 27 judges (three Supreme Court and 12 each on the Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal Appeals) are available here: . Until its dissolution in 2014, the 12-member Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission reviewed the record of incumbent judges and published its findings approximately six weeks before the retention elections. This report gave the panel's rationale for its recommendations based on the public record of each of the judges and a public interview process in which potential areas for improvement were noted. The report summarized these findings and noted the vote by which judge was recommended (or, theoretically, not recommended) for retention, although not how each individual commissioner voted. This report was published in the state's major metropolitan newspapers; the 2006 report appeared in Sunday papers as a special section. The 2006 report endorsed all of the incumbent judges seeking reelection, most unanimously and none by a margin of less than 8-3; one member appointed to the review panel at this time was unable to serve. History The General Assembly adopted the Modified Missouri Plan in 1971 to apply to judges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Court of Criminal Appeals. Two years later, the Democratic majority in the Legislature was alarmed that Republican Governor Winfield Dunn was going to be able to appoint all five Supreme Court justices when their eight-year terms expired in 1974, meaning that they would subsequently face the voters as incumbents . The Legislature passed a bill to exempt the Supreme Court from the Modified Missouri Plan and return it to popular election, but it was vetoed by Governor Dunn. At the same time, Republicans in upper East Tennessee were pressing hard to create a new medical school at East Tennessee State University (ETSU). Dunn, who was from Memphis, opposed the creation of a second state medical school that would compete for resources with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UT Health and Sciences Center), which was in Dunn's hometown. Dunn vetoed the bill creating the medical school. House Speaker Ned McWherter, D-Dresden, and Rep. Palma Robinson, R-Jonesborough, agreed to swap votes with McWherter providing some Democratic votes to override the medical school veto and Robinson providing some Republican votes to override the Supreme Court bill veto. The deal went down just as planned, creating what is now known as the James Quillen School of Medicine at ETSU, and removed the Supreme Court from the Modified Missouri Plan. In 1978, a judiciary amendment proposed by a limited constitutional convention which had met the previous fall, was defeated in a statewide special election at which only a series of proposed constitutional amendments were considered. It would have, among other provisions, largely formalized the adoption of the Modified Missouri Plan. The other amendments under consideration at the time were primarily of a technical nature, serving mostly to remove obsolete language, such as clauses forbidding interracial marriage and requiring public school segregation, which had long been rendered totally invalid by prior federal judicial decisions, and all were approved by large majorities. Only the judiciary amendment would have made a major, substantive change, and it was rejected by a large majority, which failed to provide any closure on the issue. From 1974 until 1994, justices of the Supreme Court stood for partisan election, but they were nominated by the executive committees of their respective parties rather than in primary elections as was the case for other state officials standing for election. Reflecting the partisan balance of the state at the time, Democrats won every election for the Supreme Court in this time frame, often without Republican opposition. The Modified Missouri Plan continued to apply to the two intermediate appellate courts. During the 20 years of the Modified Missouri Plan, no judges were removed from office by the voters. In 1994, the Legislature overhauled the process to include the Supreme Court again, provide more evaluation of incumbent justices, and provide more information to voters in advance of retention elections. The Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission was created to review and rate the performance of individual judges and publish that information. This became known as the Tennessee Plan. Under the Tennessee Plan, one judge (State Supreme Court Justice Penny White) was removed in 1996. She was highly rated by the Evaluation Commission, but her opinion in a death penalty case became controversial and this was played up by those opposing her reconfirmation. Opposing views Criticism of the plan centers on the creation of a self-perpetuating system of selection in which the public at large is in effect shut out of meaningful decision-making. Some opponents asserted that the process violated the Tennessee State Constitution in that the yes-no balloting it calls for does not truly constitute an \\"election\\" in the sense intended by the document's framers. This question was adjudicated by a special Supreme Court in a case filed by political gadfly John Jay Hooker. The regular members of the Supreme Court recused themselves from the case as interested parties, since they had been selected under the provisions in question. The special court found the process to be fully compliant with applicable provisions of the state constitution.) However, the General Assembly chose to terminate the selection commission under provisions of the Tennessee Sunset Law, which causes the existence of most state agencies to end automatically after a specific period of years unless their continued existence is reauthorized. The Judicial Selection Commission was sunseted as of June 30, 2013; however, a new 17-member body consisting of many of the members of the former commission, but several new appointees, assists Governor Bill Haslam in appointing persons to judicial vacanices until an amendment to the state Constitution specifically authorizing the Tennessee Plan was voted on in the November 2014 general election. Further litigation As of January, 2015, opponents of the Tennessee Plan were still fighting it in the courts. Their complaint centers around the wording of the ballot question in the 2014 referendum, and the fact that the other constitutional amendments on the ballot which involved changing constitutional language were worded in a way which showed both the language proposed for replacement and the proposed replacement language while the judicial amendment showed only the proposed new language without showing the language calling for the election of the judges of the Supreme Court and intermediate appeallate courts which was being proposed for deletion.

This is an emotion recognized in the Sikh system as a spring of desire and is as such counted as one of the Five Evils. It expresses itself in several forms from silent sullenness to hysterical tantrums and violence. In Sikh Scripture krodh usually appears in combination with kam — as \\"kam krodh\\". The coalescence is not simply for the sake of alliterative effect. Krodh (ire) is the direct progeny of kam (desire). The latter when thwarted or jilted produces the former. The Scripture also counts krodh (or its synonym kop) among the four rivers of fire. \\"Violence, attachment, covetousness and wrath,\\" says Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji \\"are like four rivers of fire; those who fall in them burn, and can swim across, O Nanak, only through God's grace\\" (GG, 147). Elsewhere Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji says, \\"Kam and krodh dissolve the body as borax melts gold\\" (GG, 932). Shri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, Nanak V, censures krodh in these words: \\"O krodh, thou enslavest sinful men and then caperest around them like an ape.\\" In thy company men become base and are punished variously by Death's messengers. The Merciful God, the Eradicator of the sufferings of the humble, O Nanak, alone saveth all\\" (GG, 1358). Shri Guru Ram Das Ji, Nanak IV, warns: \\"Do not go near those who are possessed by wrath uncontrollable\\" (GG, 40). Krodh is to be vanquished and eradicated. This is done through humility and firm faith in the Divine. Shri Guru Arjan Dev Ji's prescription: \\"Do not be angry with any one; search your own self and live in the world with humility. Thus, O Nanak, you may go across (the ocean of existence) under God's grace\\" (GG, 259). Shaikh Farid, a thirteenth-century Muslim saint whose compositions are preserved in the Sikh Scripture, says in one of his couplets: \\"O Farid, do good to him who hath done thee evil and do not nurse anger in thy heart; no disease will then afflict thy body and all felicities shall be thine\\" (GG, 1381-82). Righteous indignation against evil, injustice and tyranny is, however, not to be equated with krodh as an undesirable passion. Several hymns in the Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, particularly those by Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Bhagat Kabir Ji, express in strong terms their disapproval of the corruption of their day.

According to Sikhism, it makes an individual selfish and self-centred. It takes a person away from his religious and social duties. A person can become blind with greed in an effort to control the desire for unlimited worldly possessions. Sikhs do not believe that it is wrong to enjoy the good things in life, to be wealthy or to be admired by others. The Gurus taught that human beings should make the most of everything that God has given. However, if a person's actions and thoughts are focused on possessing the material things in life he or she is no longer focused on God then they are moving further and further from liberation and Mukti. The following Shabads from Gurbani clarify this cardinal vice: * Their intellect and understanding are perverted; they just don't understand. They are filled with greed and corruption. (Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Aang 27 line 1129) * The world is deceived and plundered by riches, youth, greed and egotism. (Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Aang 61 line 2477) * When you are under the power of sexual desire, anger and worldly attachment, or a greedy miser in love with your wealth; if you have committed the four great sins and other mistakes; even if you are a murderous fiend ..... if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, and contemplate Him, even for a moment, you shall be saved.

One is saved only by holding tight to good deeds. ((2)) (Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Aang 147 line 6072) * You practice greed, avarice and great falsehood, and you carry such a heavy burden. O body, I have seen you blowing away like dust on the earth. ((1)) (Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Aang 154 line 6435) * With greed within them, their minds are filthy, and they spread filth around.

Life Trojanow was born in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1965. In 1971 his family fled Bulgaria through Yugoslavia and Italy to Germany, where they received political asylum. In 1972 the family travelled on to Kenya, where Ilija's father had obtained a job as engineer. With one interruption from 1977–1981, Ilija Trojanow lived in Nairobi until 1984, and attended the German School Nairobi. After a stay in Paris, he studied law and ethnology at Munich University from 1985 to 1989. He interrupted these studies to found Kyrill-und-Method-Verlag in 1989, and after that Marino-Verlag in 1992, both of which specialised in African literature. In 1999 Trojanow moved to Mumbai and became intensely involved with Indian life and culture. He has lived in Cape Town, returned to Germany (Mainz), and then to Austria, where he currently resides in Vienna. In the 1990s Trojanow wrote several non-fiction and travel books about Africa, published an anthology of contemporary African literature and translated African authors into German. His first novel, \\"Die Welt ist groß und Rettung lauert überall\\", appeared in 1996. In it he recounts his family's experiences as political refugees and asylum seekers. After that appeared the science fiction novel \\"Autopol\\", created on the Internet as a \\"novel in progress,\\" \\"Hundezeiten\\", a travel account of a visit to his Bulgarian homeland, and books dealing with his experiences in India. His reportage \\"Zu den heiligen Quellen des Islam\\" describes a pilgrimage to Mecca. Since 2002 Ilija Trojanow has been member of the PEN centre of the Federal Republic of Germany. Among other awards he received the Bertelsmann Literature Prize at the Ingeborg Bachmann competition in Klagenfurt in 1995, the Marburg Literature Prize in 1996, the Thomas Valentin Prize in 1997, the Adelbert von Chamisso Prize in 2000 and the Leipzig Book Fair Prize in the category of fiction for his novel \\"Der Weltensammler\\" (The Collector of Worlds) in 2006.

Biography Channing Pollock was the son of Robert Burns Pollock and Marjorie Leppert. His first marriage, to Naomi Phelps, produced one son, Russell. His second marriage was to Jozy, a woman born in England. He was named after the author Channing Pollock when Majorie met him whilst she was pregnant. He first became interested in magic at the age of 21. After serving in the US Navy, Pollock used his G.I. Bill to study at the Chavez School of Magic in La Verne, California from which he graduated in 1952. Career Magician Pollock was recognized as one of the most sophisticated and charismatic practitioners of his craft. Strikingly handsome with an enigmatic stage presence, he was best known for an act in which he would elegantly produce doves out of thin air, and he was often billed as \\"the most beautiful man in the world\\". Pollock's early work as a magician was on the nightclub circuit, where his talents were enhanced by his good looks. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1954, and went on to make several appearances at the London Palladium. By the mid-1950s Pollock was unsurpassed in his field, and he had spawned a great many imitators. But his act was unique, and the excitement in his routine was so tied up with his own personality (he always made a point of never smiling until he was taking his final bow) that copyists never had quite the same impact. He appeared at cabaret venues and in special shows all over the world, performing for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Queen Elizabeth II and at the wedding of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly. At the height of his career he was one of America's highest-paid entertainers. Actor In 1959 his act was seen in the film European Nights, and the following year he decided to give up his career as a magician to become an actor. He appeared in a number of thrillers and dramas, including Musketeers of the Sea (1962), with Aldo Ray and Pier Angeli; Sceicco rosso (1962); ' (1963); and Georges Franju's Judex (1963), in which he played the title character. According to Jacques Champreux, grandson of Louis Feuillade and co-scenarist of the film, he was being touted as a possible new Rudolph Valentino. Nothing came of it. He also appeared on several American variety shows such as Bonanza, Daniel Boone, and The Beverly Hillbillies. Farming and mentoring In 1971 he abandoned show business entirely, and he and his wife set up an organic farm at Moss Beach, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He continued, however, to act as a friend and mentor to many aspiring magicians. He gave his own act, including his birds, to his chauffeur in London, Frank Brooker, who went on performing the act for several years under the name of Franklyn. Death Pollock died in Las Vegas from complications due to cancer. He was 79 years old, and his wife predeceased him.

It is called aaskti \\"आसक्ति\\" in Hindi, which have been considered a root cause for राग द्वेष all the sorrows in life, in Hindu religious texts itself is a cause of ignorance अज्ञान which is due to worldly illusion माया (maya). In another context, it stands for “the snare of worldly illusion, infatuation.” Its function is twofold: it bedims the discernment of truth, prevents the discernment of reality, and it creates an error of judgement or leads to wrong knowledge (mithya jnana). Humans believe in an eternal reality of their own existence or ego; they see truth in what is false and seek happiness in what begets suffering. In Punjabi Moh generally means love of and attachment to worldly things and relations. In Sikh Scripture, the term frequently occurs coupled with maya (maia) as maya-moh interpreted both as infatuation for or clinging to the illusory world of the senses and as illusion of worldly love and attachment. Sikh interpretation of maya, however, differs from that of classical, advaita philosophy, which considers the phenomenal world unreal and therefore an illusion caused by human ignorance. In Sikhism, the visible world is a manifestation of God Himself and is therefore real; yet it is not satya or true in the sense of being immutable and eternal. This world of mass, form and movement woven into the warp and woof of time and space is God’s play created at His pleasure and is as such real and sacred; but it represents only one transient aspect and not the Ultimate Reality. Maya is not an illusion in the sense of a mirage, a factual nullity; it is a delusion which represents transient as permanent and a part as the whole. Moh for maya, i.e. for this transient world of the senses, hinders the soul’s search for its ultimate goal and is, therefore, one of the Five Evils. It is related, on the one hand, to kam (desire, love) and lobh (possessiveness, covetousness) and, on the other, to ahankar (sense of I, my and mine). That is how moh has been referred to as a net, maiajal (GG, 266). Guru Nanak advises shedding of moh as it is the source of all evil and a cause for repeated births and deaths. (GG, 356). The antidote to moh is non- attachment. This is not easy, for the Gurus preach active participation in life rather than renunciation and escapism. Ultimately, of course, all depends on nadar or God’s grace. Says Guru Nanak “nadari kare ta ehu mohu jai—by (His) grace alone will this moh be cancelled” (GG, 356). The right remedy is the understanding (gian) that the mundane world, its relations and affairs, demanding one’s participation and involvement are transient. Non-attachment thus is not non-action, but an attitude to action characterized by Guru Nanak as that of a bajigar, participant in a sport. The world, says Guru Nanak in a hymn in Maru measure, “is like a seasonal pastureland where one passeth but a few days. . . Like the bajigar one plays one’s part here and departs” (GG, 1023). An image in gurbani describing the ideal life is that of the lotus which, although living in water, keeps its head above it without allowing itself to be submerged.

The earliest occurrence of Velama as a term for a community dates from the 17th century. Origin and history The Velamas are described by that name from the 17th century and in the following century some held zamindari positions under the kings of Golconda, which gave them considerable powers over small regions in Telangana. The kings chose to distinguish between these various Velama groups by adopting a system of ranks. This caused a competitive emphasis to be placed on the status and trappings of Velama communities, resulting in rivalries based on recognition of wealth and honours that had been historically granted. Among those that came to dominate were the Velugotis of Venkatagiri, in the coastal Nellore district, and the Appa Raos of Nuzvid. Both of these laid claims to be recognised as royal clans, while other significant groups included the Pitapuram Raos and the Ranga Raos. The Velugotis traced their history to the 12th century and had lived in various places before settling in Nellore district in 1695; their prestige became such that in the 1870s their sons were adopted as heirs by rival Velama clan leaders, such as the Pittapores, whose own lineage otherwise faced extinction due to infertility or early death of male children. Such arrangements enhanced the status of the adopter and the influence of the Velugotis. Relationship with the Padmanayaka Velama According to Cynthia Talbot, who has debunked the theories of historians in the British Raj era, the terms Velama and Padmanayaka Velama are not synonyms. Velama and Padmanayaka were listed as separate communities in Bhimeswara Puranamu.Musunuri Nayaks: A Forgotten Chapter of Andhra History, M.

It leads to envy, feelings of enmity, and restlessness amongst people. It occurs in a person only when the person is in देह बुद्धि i.e. when he consider himself a 'body' only (as a soul, we possess body). So, ahemkaar is a product of अस्मिता loss of true identity. Sikhism requires that a person serves society and community with Nimrata or humility. This is obtained by Sewa and hence, one sees the practice of devotees cleaning the footwear of visitors to a Gurdwara so that the mind of devout Sikh is made more humble.

History  Invacar badge A model 70 In 1948, Bert Greeves adapted a motorbike for exclusively manual control with the help of his paralysed cousin, Derry Preston-Cobb, as transport for Preston-Cobb. In the number of former servicemen disabled in the Second World War they spotted a commercial opportunity and approached the UK government for support, leading to the creation of Invacar Ltd. The British Ministry of Pensions distributed Invacars free to disabled people from 1948 until the 1970s. Early vehicles were powered by an air-cooled Villiers 147 cc engine, but when production of that engine ceased in the early 1970s it was replaced by a much more powerful 4-stroke 500 cc or 600 cc Steyr-Puch engine, giving a reported top speed of . During the 1960s and 70s the Invacar, with its modern fibreglass shell and ice-blue colouring—nicknamed Ministry Blue after the Ministry of Health —was produced in the tens of thousands. Developments—including an extended wheelbase, widened track and use of Austin Mini wheels—saw the Invacars right through to the end of the final DHSS contract in 1977. More than 50 variants were produced. On 31 March 2003 all Invacars owned by the government were recalled and scrapped because of safety concerns. The veteran vehicle could not meet modern-day government regulations, which required approval under the Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval scheme as part of a standard set by the European Union. There were still around 200 Invacars in Britain before the 2003 recall and scrapping programme. Hundreds of stockpiled Invacars in government warehouses were scrapped, along with all their spare parts. A few examples survive in the hands of private owners and museums in Britain and abroad. Invacars can still be used on UK roads; only vehicles owned by the government were scrapped. All Invacars were owned by the government and leased to disabled drivers as part of their disability benefit. Their use had been in decline since the introduction of the Motability scheme, which offers disabled drivers a conventional car with modified options.

Roman pots are located as close to the beamline as possible, to capture the accelerated particles which scatter by very small angles. Example The figure below shows a detector from the TOTEM experiment at LHC, used on the beamline near IP5 (interaction point 5), the location of the CMS detector. Three of these are used per Roman Pot unit. Each is shoved into place to within 10 microns of the beamline. Two detectors are placed above and below the beamline, and a third to the side. These detectors will record any protons that are not travelling precisely along the beamline, and thus record the elastic scattering of the protons. This is used to measure the total elastic cross- section, including Coulomb scattering as well as diffractive scattering (i.e. diffraction because the protons are not point particles, and have an internal structure (i.e. quarks)). Effectively, these are detectors for studying Regge theory.

There are 55 tinkhundla in Eswatini: 14 in Hhohho District, 11 in Lubombo District, 16 in Manzini District, and 14 in Shishelweni District. According to the constitution of Eswatini, the government for Eswatini is a democratic, participatory, tinkhundla-based system that emphasizes devolution of state power from central government to tinkhundla areas and individual merit as a basis for election or appointment to public office. The system is non-partisan since the constitution does not recognize political parties, although section 25 of the constitution allows for open freedom of assembly and association. Each inkhundla elects one representative to the House of Assembly of Eswatini, the lower chamber of the bicameral parliament (Libandla). The same trend is applied in local government elections. This governing system was designed by King Sobhuza II with the assistance of political scholars and lawyers. It came to effect in 1978 and was adjusted in the early 1990s. History The Tinkhundla concept of government has its roots in the Second World War, led by Prince Dabede of Gundvwini Royal Residence and Ndvuna Mfundza John Brightwell Sukati of Zabeni Royal Residence. Veteran Swazi Soldiers, who came back from 1945 to 1946 from the Middle East. These soldiers spent sometime with His Majesty King Sobhuza II, relating their experiences gained along the sea shores of the African Continent during the British Military campaign from the Durban Sea Port to Tripoli in North Africa. They recommended that in order for the economy of Swaziland to recover from ravages of the war, community centers (Tinkhundla) should be established and rally support for the King’s endeavors to bring about proportional development of the country. Also this would strengthen and enhance national safety and security strategies.http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=185&Itemid;=219 In 1977 King Sobhuza II elected Delimitation Commission came up with a recommendation of twenty two (22) Tinkhundla centres. The first Tinkhundla established were headed by Tindvuna teTinkhundla which were all ex-soldiers (umsizi) appointed by His Majesty King Sobhuza II. In 1979 Tinkhundla centers were increased from twenty two (22) to forty (40) because it was realized that most people fail to attend and participate Tinkhundla meetings. In 1993 the Tinkhundla centres were further increased to fifty five (55) following recommendations of the Delimitation Commission that was appointed by His Majesty King Mswati III. This commission was a result of people’s views during consultative commissions (Vuselas), which were led by Prince Masitsela, Prince Mahlalengangeni and Prince Guduza.http://www.gov.sz/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=188&Itemid;=222 Governance role The system emphasizes the devolution of state power from central government to Tinkhundla while individual merit is a basis for election and appointment into public office. In general, Tinkhundla stimulate community development at grassroots level, coordinating and promoting a good relationship between Government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working at the Tinkhundla level. They further provide a link between communities and government as well as other development agents to ensure the responsiveness of all national policies to the needs of the people. In the process they create harmony among all agents providing services within that Inkhundla. The Ministry of Tinkhundla Administration and Development has a mandate to facilitate the management of region development and facilitate promote service delivery at Tinkhundla and Chiefdoms levels. Tinkhundla are the foundation for the bottom-up development planning process and the delivery of local services in partnership with central government. A major area of focus in the process is the development; implementation, monitoring and evaluation of evidence based integrated development plans funded by development grants and central government budget where applicable.

These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the Gurbani so that these virtues become a part of their mind. Contentment is another very important virtue in Sikhism. Instead of constantly thinking of how to satisfy personal desires, Sikhs try to accept the circumstances of their lives and concentrate on acting in accordance with God’s Will (Hukam). They try to remember that all aspects of life are a result of God’s Will. Contentment leads to freedom from care, fear and worry. It is a very important divine quality; it is a deep godly \\"priceless jewel\\", which is acquired by those souls who move on the path of Sach Khand. When all the desires vanish the state of contentment is reached, the state of \\"Sat Santokh\\" is acquired. Desires are the reason for our sorrows and pains; it is a search for an escape from these sorrows and pains. In fulfilling desires the person gets momentary happiness; unfulfilled desires bring disappointment. A continuous string of disappointments leads to depression and to mental and physical sicknesses. Desires lead to mental and physical distortion of the mind; whereas contentment brings peace and calmness to the mind.

The nerve emerges at the mental foramen in the mandible, and divides beneath the Depressor anguli oris muscle into three branches: * one descends to the skin of the chin. * two ascend to the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip. These branches communicate freely with the facial nerve.

It arises from the middle of the inferior ganglion of vagus nerve and in its course receives a branch from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system. The cricothyroid muscles are innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve. All other intrinsic laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The superior laryngeal nerve consists of two branches: the internal laryngeal nerve (sensory), which supplies sensory fibers to the laryngeal mucosa, and the external laryngeal nerve (motor), which innervates the cricothyroid muscle. The recurrent laryngeal nerve gets its name from the fact that it loops below the aorta on its way to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve passes under and around the aorta on its way to the larynx, whereas the right recurrent laryngeal nerve passes under and around the subclavian artery. Because the aorta is inferior to the subclavian artery, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is a bit longer than the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. However, there is no discernible effect on the timing of neural impulses to the muscles these two nerves serve. By comparison with the recurrent laryngeal nerves, the superior laryngeal nerve takes a more direct route on the way to the cricothyroid muscles.Fuller, D. R., Pimentel, J. T., & Peregoy, B. M. (2012). Applied anatomy & physiology for speech-language pathology & audiology. Baltimore, MD: Wolters Kluwer- Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Structure The superior laryngeal nerve descends, by the side of the pharynx, behind the internal carotid artery, and divides into two branches —the external laryngeal nerve and the internal laryngeal nerve. The external laryngeal nerve is the smaller, external branch. It descends on the larynx, beneath the sternothyroid muscle, to supply the cricothyroid muscle. The external branch functions to tense the vocal cords by activating the cricothyroid muscle, increasing pitch. The external laryngeal nerve gives branches to pharyngeal plexus and the superior portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, and communicates with the superior cardiac nerve behind the common carotid artery. The internal laryngeal nerve is the internal branch. It descends to the thyrohyoid membrane, piercing it in company with the superior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx. Of these sensory branches, some are distributed to the epiglottis, the base of the tongue, and the epiglottic glands; others pass posteriorly, in the aryepiglottic fold, to supply the mucous membrane surrounding the entrance of the larynx, and the mucous lining of the larynx as far down as the vocal folds. A filament descends beneath the mucous membrane on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage and joins the recurrent nerve. Above the vocal folds the sensory innervation of the larynx is via the internal laryngeal nerve. Below the vocal folds it is by way of branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The vocal fold itself receives dual innervation from both nerves. Clinical significance A superior laryngeal nerve palsy changes the pitch of the voice and causes an inability to make explosive sounds due to paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle. If no recovery is evident three months after the palsy initially presents, the damage is most likely to be permanent. A bilateral palsy presents as a tiring and hoarse voice. It can be injured in surgery involving the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). Understanding the most common anatomic variations of the distal portion of the external laryngeal nerve and its relation to the inferior constrictor muscle is critical and allows identifying and preserving the integrity of this nerve in most cases. The external branch is susceptible to damage during thyroidectomy or cricothyrotomy, as it lies immediately deep to the superior thyroid artery. The ability to produce pitched sounds is then impaired along with easy voice fatigability, (usually mono-toned voice). Irritation of the internal laryngeal nerve results in uncontrolled coughing - usually as a result of food or water in the laryngopharynx. The lesion of this branch (for example, during surgery) that seeks an anterior approach to the cervix, is associated with a loss of the laryngeal reflex of cough and an elevate risk of aspiration pneumonia.

As early as 1733, a fortification called Fort San Andres was planned to replace a redoubt of fascines and earth, which was the only defense to Port of Spain. This however was not completed until 1787. The redoubt was located more or less where Royal Bank now stands. Port of Spain or as it was known to the Spanish, Puerto de los Hispanioles, initially was restricted to a few streets east of the St. Ann's or Tragarete River which at that time ran west along what is now Park Street and south to the foreshore through what is now Woodford Square and Chacon Street. St. Ann's River, now better known as the Dry River, was diverted to its present course by the Spanish Governor Chacón and completed in 1787. The new fort was constructed as a mole linked to the mainland by a wooden bridge. The fort mounted five cannon and was \\"useful in maintaining good order among shipping anchored off-shore\\". In 1845, the Port of Spain Town council approved the filling of the Port of Spain waterfront to the northern side of Fort San Andres. Late in the nineteenth century the shoreline was again filled to its present line, completely land-locking the Fort. The Fort fell into disuse and later a structure was built on the old fort to house the Harbour Master and various other government offices, including the Police Service Traffic Branch. In 1995 the building was restored and converted to a museum of the City of Port of Spain. Several of the original cannons survive and the foundations bear the date 1785.

The National Traffic System (NTS) is an organized network of amateur radio operators sponsored by the American Radio Relay League for the purpose of relaying messages throughout the U.S. and Canada.ARRL Public Service Communications Manual 2 March 2010 During normal times, these messages are routine greetings (\\"Happy birthday Aunt Mary\\") and keep the system well oiled and the operators trained so that everything works when needed. When there is an emergency or disaster NTS works closely with the Amateur Radio Emergency Service to provide emergency communications. The most common type of disaster-related messages are \\"health and welfare\\" inquiries and notifications into and out of the area affected by the disaster. In time of disaster, it is easy to expand the system by simply creating additional meeting times for the nets with high volume, or by setting up a specific \\"trunk line\\" between two points. History Traffic passing by formal relay (via amateur radio) originates from the founding of the American Radio Relay League. The NTS as it exists today was first outlined by George Hart, W1NJM (died 24 March 2013) in \\"New National Traffic Plan: ARRL Maps New Traffic Organization for All Amateurs\\" as part of the September 1949 issue of QST. While traffic passing between amateur radio operators was nothing new, Hart's system extended coverage of traffic capability in a uniform manner across the U.S. and Canada, creating formal section and area nets devoted to handling NTS-organized traffic.\\"National Traffic System Developer George Hart, W1NJM\\", March 27, 2013 Organizational structure NTS is defined using geographic areas. The U.S. is divided into areas that approximate time zones. Areas are divided into regions, and regions into sections that correspond to a state. Each of these subdivisions has nets for collecting and distributing traffic. A net is nothing more than a time of day and a radio frequency where the appropriate group of amateur operators can meet to send the messages on their way. ARRL Radiogram traffic typically begins and ends its journey at local nets, often through nearby repeaters. Local nets typically involve city or county-wide coverage on VHF (2-metre band) or UHF (70 cm band), and although the ARRL does not endorse a single mode for traffic passing, messages are typically relayed by voice at this level. Representatives from section nets relay traffic collected from local nets up to the appropriate region net, or relay to a nearby section for further delivery. Messages are exchanged between section and region representatives, which are then passed to area nets, the highest level in the system. Nets at these upper levels usually take place on HF band modes for their distance capabilities (e.g. 20 or 10 metres) and can be passed by voice, CW, digital, and even packet modes. As traffic trickles back down through the area, region, section, and local nets, messages are typically delivered via a local telephone call, depending on handling instructions. Messages can also be delivered by hand or via message carrier, including the postal service, however Part 97 dictates that ham radio operators cannot receive financial restitution for their service. If a message is undeliverable, handling instructions may dictate that a service message be originated back to the sending station. Traffic passing This process is best explained by an example. Let's say that someone in Wisconsin wants to send a birthday greeting to Aunt Mary in California. They telephone their local ham friend and give him the message. * At 6:30 local time, the Wisconsin ham attends (\\"checks into\\") the Wisconsin Section net. One station there has been designated to accept all outgoing messages, and Aunt Mary's message is sent to that station. * At 7:45, the station who received the message checks into the Region net. This net consists of representatives from all the section nets in the region, and one station has been designated to accept all traffic that flows out of the region. Aunt Mary's greeting will be sent to this station. * At 8:30, the station from the region checks into the Area net and sends Aunt Mary's greeting to the designated representative from the Pacific area. * At 8:30 Pacific Time, the Pacific Area net meets. (All the area nets meet at 8:30 local time; since they are in different time zones there is no overlap.) At this point the process is repeated in the opposite order ** The area representative sends the message to the appropriate region representative, ** The region representative meets a later session of the region net and sends the message to the appropriate section representative, ** The section representative meets a later section net and sends the message to the closest operator to Aunt Mary's home * The final recipient calls Aunt Mary on the telephone and delivers the greeting. Perhaps this sounds rather complex, but it really isn't. Each net uses the same procedure and operating techniques, so as novice operators gain experience they can \\"graduate\\" from section to region to area nets. Every message is placed into the same format. The operation is disciplined but not unduly complex.

It was constructed in Confederate Railroads - Tallahassee gauge.  History  The railroad was conceived and financed by leading cotton planters who needed a way to get their crop to textile mills in England and New England. It was also used by naval stores merchants and timber interests of the area to transport their goods to East Coast ports. The Tallahassee Railroad Company was approved in 1835 by the Florida Territorial Legislative Council. Also that year, the Tallahassee Railroad Company received the first federal land grant to a railroad. In 1835 construction began on the Tallahassee-St. Marks Railroad. The railroad was completed in 1837 and began operation that year. It was a mule-drawn railroad with wooden rails that connected Tallahassee, Florida, then the territorial capitol, with the Gulf port of St. Marks — a distance of . By 1839 the railroad was extended south to Port Leon. In 1843, Port Leon was destroyed by a massive hurricane. The railroad terminal there was moved back to St. Marks. In 1856, the wooden rails were replaced by steel rails, and mules by steam locomotives. During the Civil War, the Confederates used the railroad extensively to move troops, artillery and supplies in defense of Tallahassee. In March 1865, the railroad achieved its highest military significance when it was used to deploy Confederate troops quickly south from Tallahassee in the face of an advance by Union troops. The railroad enabled Generals Samuel Jones and William Miller to put enough men into place to defeat Union General John Newton at the Battle of Natural Bridge on March 6, 1865. In 1880, the railroad began to transport naval stores and timber for Leon County's logging industry. In 1983, the Seaboard Railroad filed to abandon the line between Capital Circle in Tallahassee and St. Marks. The Tallahassee-St. Marks railway line has the historical distinction of being the longest-operating railroad in Florida and served the area for 147 years. Francis de Laporte de Castelnau called it \\"the worst that has yet been built in the entire world.\\" In 1984 the corridor was purchased by the Florida Department of Transportation. The Florida Park Service currently maintains it as the Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail.

Allan Hanson, a postmodern anthropologist, believed that the analytical purpose of studying cultural inventions was not to uncover which portions of a culture's belief systems are invented, but rather to study how cultural inventions become accepted as authentic within groups.Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention & its Logic.

Marc J. Swartz. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338 Case study: Maori Allan Hanson proposed that several aspects of Maori culture had been invented by European scholars who were accustomed to analytical frameworks focused on long-distance migration and diffusion. Because of this, he believed that European scholars constructed the notion that a \\"Great Fleet\\", headed by a man named Kupe from, a neighboring island was responsible for the initial discovery and peopling of New Zealand. Although Maori ancestors most likely arrived in canoes from nearby islands, Hanson believed that the account of the Great Fleet was created to simplify various Maori traditions into a single tradition.Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention & its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill. Additionally, to make the Maori seem more elevated in European eyes, scholars may have invented a cult to the named Io, who was thought to be a supreme being that controlled all the other gods in the Maori pantheon. The story of Io creating the world is so similar to that of the Book of Genesis in the Bible, that it is believed to have been a European invention.Hiroa, Te Rangi (Peter H. Buck). 1950. The Coming of the Maori. 2nd Edition. Wellington: Whitecombe and Tombs. Hanson asserted that those and other elements of Maori tradition were incorporated and taken to be true by the Maori and that they have been passed down through generations by way of oral tradition. According to Hanson, \\"Io and the Great Fleet have been incorporated into Maori lore and are passed down from elders to juniors in storytelling, oratory, and other Maori contexts\\".Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention & its Logic.

It was previously called Prescot Grammar School. It was announced in late 2015 by the headteacher, Judy Walker, that the historic name and the link to the school's near half-millenium of tradition (which had been deprecated between 2009-2015 by the local authority) was being restored as a consequence of a successful application by the school for academy status. The official opening of the reformed school was on the 28th of April. The main historical source is local historian F. A. Bailey's 40 page pamphlet published to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the school in 1944 and reissued in 1971 under the title PGS 1544 - 1971 with postscripts by G. Dixon and the then headmaster, J. C. S. Weekes. History Foundation The school was founded in 1544 by Gilbert Latham, a local clergyman (later Archdeacon of Man) who left £140 in his will to fund a schoolmaster (at a stipend of £7 per year) to run a free grammar school. The school was first based in Church Street, opposite the Prescot Parish Church of St. Mary's. It then moved in 1760 to a site in High Street, where it remained until 1924. The next move was to the spacious site on St. Helens Road, accommodated in newly built wooden buildings which were originally intended to be temporary, but were expanded and augmented in the 1960s by a brick-built assembly hall (\\"Spencer Briggs Hall\\"), classrooms and purpose-built metalwork and woodwork workshops, and remained in use until 1978 when they fell victim to an arson attack by a disturbed former pupil. Famous headteachers include C. W. H. Richardson, who ensured its survival during difficult times in the 1920s and 1930s, and R. Spencer Briggs from 1937 to 1963. Geoffrey Dixon was a stalwart of the 20th century and taught at the school for 42 years from 1927 to 1969, reaching the position of deputy headmaster. By 1944, when the Butler Education Act brought the school into the free national system, the school was in fact charging tuition fees. At this point, entry criteria passed from the ability to pay to the ability to pass the 11+ exam. From the 1930s to the 1960s the school expanded under the leadership of headmaster R. Spencer Briggs to a peak of 650 boys. Briggs modelled his school superficially on the British public school model, with a 'house' system, prefects, school uniform, a heavy emphasis on games (particularly football and cricket), and indeed corporal punishment. There was also rich extracurricular activity: debating, amateur dramatics, choral and instrumental music, and a plethora of school societies. During this period the school applied for and was granted its coat of arms. The Latin motto \\"Futuram civitatem inquirimus\\" translates as \\"Seeking society's future\\". In other words: \\"Looking forward\\". Becoming comprehensive and co-educational (merger with the Girls' Grammar) In 1975, it became part of the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, and joined with Prescot Grammar School for Girls (founded 1955) to become Prescot School. The school moved to the girls' school site as a result of two arson incidents at the Boys' School site in St. Helens Road. The extensive playing fields of the boys' school in St Helens Road were sold off and are now covered by a housing development. In 2000 Prescot School gained specialist status as a Language College. The Prescotian In 2000, the Prescotian webzine was set up to enable former pupils to keep in contact and establish an informal archive of photographs and articles, see below for link. Merger with Higher Side With funding from the Labour government's Building Schools for the Future initiative, the school was rebuilt, In September 2009 it merged with Higher Side School in Whiston to become officially named \\"Knowsley Park Centre for Learning, Serving Prescot, Whiston and the Wider Community\\" in 2009, listing as a compromise all the schools and communities merged into it. The name lasted seven years before its headmistress, who called the name \\"so embarrassing\\" cut it to simply \\"Prescot School\\" in 2016.{see http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/families/education-and- schools/find-a-school/secondary-schools/knowsley-park-cfl.aspx} Notable alumni * Gill Burns MBE, former English Ladies Rugby Captain * Paul Lewis, classical pianist, soloist at the 2005 Last Night of the Proms * Dave McCabe, The Zutons lead singer * Colin Vearncombe, singer songwriter formerly known as the artist Black Prescot Grammar School (both schools) * Alan A'Court, England and Liverpool FC footballer * Jack Aspinwall, Conservative MP for Kingswood from 1979 to 1983 and for Wansdyke from 1983 to 1997 * Dave Bamber, Blackpool, Coventry City footballer * Alan George Bamford CBE, Principal of Homerton College, Cambridge from 1985 to 1991 * Paul Blinkhorn, archaeologist, pottery expert and TV personality on programmes BBC Time Team, and Channel 5 Pub Dig * Prof Sir Mike Brady, BP Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Oxford * The Right Honourable Lord Burrows, Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom since 2020, formerly Professor of the Law of England at the University of Oxford * Kenneth Crook CMG, Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1976 to 1979 * Peter Eglin (1958–65), Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada * Nicholas Fazackerley, celebrated lawyer and MP for Preston in the years 1732-67 * Jacqueline Foster, Conservative MEP for North West England since 2009 and from 1999 to 2004 * Pete Griffiths, founding member and bassist of punk rock band The Spitfire Boys * Tony Hazzard, songwriter, session singer and recording artiste * Stan Hey, TV and film scriptwriter (Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, Dalziel and Pascoe, Coast to Coast) and journalist * Prof Graham Hough, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge from 1966 to 1975 * Sue Johnston, actress * Prof Peter Lawrenson, award-winning electrical engineer, President from 1992 to 1993 of the Institution of Electrical Engineers * Ian McIntyre, broadcaster and Controller of BBC Radio 4 from 1976 to 1978 and BBC Radio 3 from 1978 to 1987 * Keith Macklin, sports broadcaster and journalist * Geoff Nulty, Everton FC footballer * John Edward Parkinson, Professor of Law at Bristol University and promulgator of the concept of stakeholders in corporate law * Laurence Perkins, principal bassoonist in Manchester Camerata * John David Pugh, Lib Dem MP for Southport since 2001 * Nigel Roberts, computer scientist * Stuart Sutcliffe, bassist for the Beatles for two years * Sir George Sweeney, former principal of Knowsley Community College; knighted in 2000 * Rt Rev John Waine, former Bishop of Chelmsford from 1986 to 1996 * Prof Sid Watkins, safety supremo for Formula One Grand Prix motor racing, Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of London from 1972 to 1993 References External links * Prescot School * The Prescotian * Prescot Roll of Honour Category:1544 establishments in England Category:Educational institutions established in the 1540s Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2009 Category:2009 disestablishments in England ","title":"Prescot School"},{"id":"4488874","text":"Guy Park, also known as Guy Park State Historic Site or Guy Park Manor, is a house built in 1774 in the Georgian style for Guy Johnson, the Irish-born nephew and son-in-law to Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in colonial New York.

In 1773 the senior Johnson gave his nephew and daughter a square mile of land near the Mohawk River as a wedding present. They built their first house there but it burned the next year after being struck by lightning.Earle, pg. 69 Guy Johnson commissioned a limestone house in the Georgian architectural style, which was built in 1774. After his uncle William Johnson died in 1774, Guy was appointed by the Crown to succeed him as British Superintendent for Indian Affairs. His priority was to keep the powerful Iroquois nations on the side of the British in the face of increasing colonial tensions. As a Loyalist Johnson risked imprisonment, because of the hostility of local settlers who favored independence in the coming American Revolutionary War. He gathered allies and friends and left the area in 1775 for Canada, abandoning his mansion. His wife Polly died in Oswego, New York during the journey. From 1776-1778 Johnson lived in British-occupied New York City. By 1779, he had established headquarters in Niagara, Ontario, from where he directed military forces against the rebels in the Mohawk Valley. After the war, he returned to London, where he died in 1788.\\"Guy Johnson\\", Tryon County, NY, Rootsweb, accessed 10 October 2011 Description The house was built in 1774 of limestone in the Georgian architectural style. It is two stories tall. History Lock E11 on the Mohawk River behind Guy Park Front view from 1936 In 1779 the new governments of the United States and New York declared as traitors those Loyalists who had gone to Canada, and the state confiscated their properties. The state sold Guy Park to a private owner. A steady flow of migrants moved along the road in the plain by the Mohawk River as part of the European-American settlement of former Iroquois lands. At this time, the state and speculators were selling millions of acres of land to the west; thousands of migrants from New England crossed the state seeking such lands; some veterans were awarded grants of land in lieu of pay. Guy Park was used for years in the early nineteenth century as a tavern and stagecoach stop, as it was on the Mohawk Turnpike next to the river, the two main transportation routes across the state. The Erie Canal was completed in 1825, and a lock is located near the house. Later, the house was sold and served again as a private residence for many years. In 1907 the mansion was purchased by the state for preservation as a historic site. In the early 21st century, it was adapted for use as a local history museum, the Walter Elwood Museum. Elwood, a history teacher, began collecting in the 1930s. The museum has featured exhibits from his large collection of local artifacts, ranging from historic objects crafted by the Mohawk and other Iroquois tribes of New York, to items related to the development and history of the Erie Canal, the local carpet industry, and the city of Amsterdam. In August 2011, shortly after being occupied by the museum, the house was severely damaged by flooding of the Mohawk River in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. Half of two floors were destroyed and its contents soaked and scattered. The state has struggled to stabilize the building.Liz Leyden, \\"Manor That Has Stood for Centuries Teeters in Storm's Wake\\", New York Times, September 1, 2011 The museum has moved to a new location.

Structure  The nasociliary nerve terminates by bifurcating into the infratrochlear and the anterior ethmoidal nerves. The infratrochlear nerve travels anteriorly in the orbit along the upper border of the medial rectus muscle and underneath the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle. It exits the orbit medially and divides into small sensory branches.  Function  The infratrochlear nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the eye lids, the conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, lacrimal caruncle and the side of the nose above the medial canthus.

She is the third Grand-class ship in the fleet, following and , and debuted in 2002. Star Princess is scheduled to be transferred to P&O; Cruises Australia, debuting for the company as Pacific Encounter in November 2021.  History   Star Princess   Construction and debut  In January 1998, the then-unnamed ship was ordered as part of a two-ship order made by Princess with Fincantieri, with each ship costing US$425 million. The two 109,000 GT Grand-class ships were scheduled to be delivered in 2001, and slotted to sail in the Caribbean from Port Everglades year-round. Later, in October 2000, Princess announced Star Princess would instead be deployed to Los Angeles for Mexican Riviera cruises following her delivery, with Alaska itineraries during the summers. Star Princess would become the first then-dubbed \\"mega-ship\\" ever to be homeported in Los Angeles and also cruise from the West Coast on a full-time basis. Star Princess was launched on 10 May 2001 at Fincantieri's shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. On 29 June 2001, a fire started in a galley on board when sparks from a welding torch ignited it. The fire spread into a dining room but damage was not extensive and construction continued until completion on 25 January 2002. Star Princess was christened on 25 January 2002 at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard by her godmother, Gunilla Antonini, wife of Fincantieri's executive chairman, Corrado Antonini.  Operational career  At the time of her delivery to Princess Cruises, Star Princess was too large to make a Panama Canal transit, so to arrive in Los Angeles, she embarked on an eastward voyage from Italy, taking her through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Indian Ocean, and a 26-day inaugural voyage across the Pacific Ocean. Star Princess' first homeport was Los Angeles and her maiden season featured itineraries to the Mexican Riviera, with her first cruise from Los Angeles, a 3-day cruise, held on 10 March 2002. That same year, Hong Kong TV drama, Ups and Downs in the Sea of Love, was filmed on board Star Princess, among other locations. She sailed to Alaska from Vancouver beginning summer 2003. In fall 2003, she became the first vessel of more than 100,000 GT to sail in Australian waters after she arrived in Sydney on 26 November 2003. She moved to Southeast Asia in the spring of 2004 before cruising the Mediterranean in the summer of 2004, the Caribbean that fall and winter, and the Baltic the following summer. She made her first trip to South America and Antarctica in January 2008. For winter 2019–2020, she was homeported in Los Angeles and sailed itineraries to the Mexican Riviera, Sea of Cortez, and Hawaii. In summer 2020, she was scheduled to homeport in San Francisco for Alaska voyages. However, following Princess' suspension of operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all summer 2020 voyages have since been cancelled. Star Princess is scheduled to resume operations in Los Angeles for winter 2020–2021 with itineraries to the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii, French Polynesia, and along the California coast. In summer 2021, Star Princess will cruise in Alaska, between Vancouver and Whittier.  Pacific Encounter  On 22 August 2018, Princess' sister brand, P&O; Cruises Australia, announced that Star Princess would be transferred to the P&O; fleet in late-2021, joining her sister ship, Golden Princess, which transfers to P&O; in October 2020. On 25 November 2019, P&O; announced that the vessel will be named Pacific Encounter upon joining the fleet. In December 2019, P&O; Cruises Australia announced that Pacific Encounter would homeport in Brisbane beginning in November 2021 and cruise to different destinations in Oceania, including the Queensland coast and Melanesia islands.  Design specifications  Star Princess measures , has a length of , a draft of , and a beam of . She is powered by a diesel-electric genset system, with six Sulzer engines: four producing and two producing . The system gives the vessel a maximum speed of . The ship houses 1,299 passenger cabins and 627 crew cabins. Of the 1,780 passenger cabins, 72% have a view outside, including 55% that include a balcony. The ship has a maximum capacity of 4,160 passengers and crew. Accidents and incidents Balconies along the port side of Star Princess Star Princess in alt= 2006 fire On 23 March 2006, at approximately 3:00AM, while en route from Grand Cayman to Montego Bay, Jamaica, a fire broke out in the passenger compartments, amidship, on the port side of the ship. Shortly after, the captain sounded the general emergency signal—seven short blasts followed by one long blast on the ship's whistle over the public address system, horn, and various alarms. Passengers evacuated their cabins into public areas through smokey hallways, grabbing their life jackets on the way. They assembled at their muster stations and were combined into groups for about seven hours. The evacuation was reportedly orderly, in contrast to deadlier fires such as those on Morro Castle and Yarmouth Castle. Lifeboats were lowered but proved to be unnecessary, as the fire was contained and doused, and the ship headed into Montego Bay under her own power. The fire was allegedly caused by a cigarette left burning on a balcony, which had become hot enough to melt the balcony divides made from plastic polycarbonate, a material that had been approved by international cruise line safety rules. The fire caused scorching damage in up to 150 cabins, and smoke damage in at least 100 more on passenger decks 9 to 12 (Dolphin, Caribe, Baja and Aloha decks, respectively). A passenger, Richard Liffidge, 72, of Georgia, died from \\"asphyxia secondary to inhalation of smoke and irrespirable gases\\" and thirteen other passengers suffered significant smoke inhalation. While a smoldering discarded cigarette probably did cause the flames, the following items were also at fault for allowing the fire to spread as quickly as it did: * The balconies' polycarbonate partitions, polyurethane deck tiles, and the plastic furniture were highly combustible and produced large quantities of very thick black smoke when burned. * The glass in the doors between the staterooms and balconies was neither fire retardant, to meet with the requirements of an ‘A’ class division, nor self-closing. * The balconies crossed main zone fire boundaries, both horizontally and vertically, and were without structural or thermal barriers at the zone or deck boundaries. * No fire detection or fire suppression systems were fitted on the balconies. Aftermath The cruise was terminated in Montego Bay and passengers were evacuated to hotels in Jamaica and subsequently flew home. All passengers received a full refund and were reimbursed any out-of-pocket travel expenses they incurred. The ship had been on a Caribbean itinerary that departed from Port Everglades on 19 March 2006. With 79 cabins destroyed and a further 204 damaged, the ship was moved to the Bahamas where she was prepared for a transatlantic crossing to the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany for repairs. Her remaining Caribbean cruises and a transatlantic cruise were cancelled, with the anticipation that she would begin her summer season in the Baltic on 15 May. The ship set sail again on 13 May 2006, and resumed its regular service on 15 May from Copenhagen. Princess implemented new measures that aim to prevent a disaster of similar proportion, which include enhanced procedures for handling fires and clear communication during emergencies. Passengers reported that the only noticeable differences were a strong smell of new carpeting, the addition of sprinklers to all balconies and the replacement of plastic furniture with non-combustible alternatives. No interior decor was significantly modified in order to maintain consistency of the ship's interior design.  2012 reported ignored distress call  On 10 March 2012, en route in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America, three passengers from Star Princess spotted a small boat drifting with waving seamen, apparently in distress, and notified the crew. However, Star Princess did not change course to investigate. On 19 March, the Ecuadorean coast guard rescued the Panamanian fishing boat Fifty Cent with one survivor on board. Subsequent communication between the survivor, a reporter, and the passengers who spotted the survivors led to allegations that the small boat sighted nine days prior was, in fact, the Fifty Cent, and that Star Princess had failed to stop and render aid. Princess first indicated that there had been a breakdown in communication and the captain had not been notified of the sighting. A later report stated that a crew member did, in fact, convey the passengers' concerns to the bridge, and that the ship's log for that time on 10 March contained an entry recording that the ship had deviated to the west to avoid the fishing nets, and that the fishermen had \\"signaled their thanks\\" for avoiding their nets. By June 2012, two lawsuits had been filed against Princess on behalf of the fishermen of the Fifty Cent. In August 2012, Princess responded with the claim that Star Princess and Fifty Cent were never within sight of one another and thus, the accusations were the result of mistaken identity. As supporting evidence, the cruise line made public the results of a drift analysis and a photographic investigation they had commissioned. In April 2013, the Bermuda Department of Maritime Administration was reported to have closed their official inquiry into the incident. The Bermuda Police Service carried out the investigation. The Department of Public Prosecutors disclosed that the passengers who were material witnesses to the case made a statement that the boat they had seen from the cruise ship was ultimately not the same boat as the one recovered by the Ecuadorean coast guard.

Content An early edition of Millenium Hall. was Scott's most significant novel. It was popular enough to go to four editions by 1778, and interest in it has revived in the 21st century among feminist literary scholars. The book takes the form of a frame tale and a series of adventures, as the narrator's long-lost cousin relates how each of the residents arrived at the female Utopia, Millenium Hall. The adventures are remarkable for their reliance on a nearly superstitious form of divine grace, where God's will manifests itself with the direct punishment of the wicked and the miraculous protection of the innocent. In one tale, a woman about to be ravished by a man is saved, literally by the hand of God, as her attacker dies of a stroke. The Hall the characters live in is a model of mid-century reform ideas. All the women have crafts with which to better themselves. Property is held in common, and education is the primary pastime. Elizabeth Montagu, Sarah Scott's sister, had become a leader of the bluestockings, a coterie of reform-minded individuals. They believed in female equality, education, and limited economic justice. They were also active in prison and health care reform. Although Elizabeth may be lightly satirized in the figure of Lady Brumpton in Millenium Hall, the Hall is a fictional embodiment of bluestocking ideals. At the same time, there is a nearly pathological revulsion at heterosexual sexuality in Millenium Hall. This antipathy is usually expressed in religious terms, as all of the sexual acts in the novel are either forms of rape or sin. Further, the characters in the novel who are married or who have children are so without any indication of romantic love between the partners. Instead of romantic love, the novel posits female friendship under a powerful duty to piety. Female friendship is true, but it is also emphatically clean by being non- sexual. Reception Although Millenium Hall has received renewed attention, it is not a novel that participates in the tradition of the novel in general. Sarah Scott's novel is not primarily interested in character (as Samuel Richardson's had been or Frances Burney's would be) or social act (as Henry Fielding's had been) or entertainment (as Aphra Behn's had been). Instead, her novel is directed toward morality, example, and, to some degree, a polemic of female education. It seeks to reform the individual female reading the novel and engage the male reader in pity. As the subtitle to the novel says, it contains \\"Anecdotes and Reflections as May excite in the Reader proper Sentiments of Humanity, and lead the Mind to the Love of VIRTUE,\\" with 'virtue' being understood in its masculine (virtus) and feminine (virginity) senses.

It is the main training centre for the Irish Defence Forces and is home to 2,000 military personnel. History  Longstanding military heritage  The Curragh has historically been a military assembly area, owing to the wide expanse of plain. In 1599 Henry Harvey noted \\"a better place for the deploying of an Army I never beheld.\\" However, the Curragh's history goes further back; it is mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters that Lóegaire Lorc, the king of Ireland, was slain on the Curragh by Cobthach Cóel Breg.Feehan (2008), p. 42 Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel chose the Curragh as a muster point for the cause of James II during the Williamite War in Ireland. In 1783, a review of the Irish Volunteers raised to assist in the defence of the country while Great Britain was at war with America held on the Curragh attracted upwards of 50,000 spectators.Feehan (2008), p. 53 It was also a muster point during the 1798 Rebellion and was mentioned in the Irish peasant song The Sean-Bhean bhocht. As translated by Padraic Colum in 1922:Feehan (2008), p. 50  Crimean War and establishment of Curragh Camp  There were numerous training camps organised on the Curragh in the nineteenth century including the training of militia to defend the country during the Napoleonic Wars.Feehan (2008), p. 44 However, the first permanent military structures were built in 1855 by British soldiers preparing for the Crimean War. These structures were wooden in character but the camp did have its own post office, a fire station, ten barracks, two churches, a water pumping station, a court house and a clock tower.Feehan (2008), p. 46 Events and routines in 19th-century camp In 1861, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited to inspect troops, including their son (Edward VII—the then Prince of Wales)—who was serving at the camp. A great troop review was held for the visit and an album of the occasion can be found in the Royal Archive at Windsor Castle.Feehan (2008), p. 45 The first of the \\"modern\\" barracks (Beresford Barracks) was built at the camp in 1879, and six new barracks were subsequently constructed through the start of the 20th century. The names of the barracks that were built by the British Army were Ponsonby Barracks, Stewart Barracks, A.S.C Barracks, Engineer Barracks, Gough Barracks and Keane Barracks. By 1893, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Lord Ralph D. Kerr CB. The garrison was the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment (18th Foot), the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers (20th Foot), and the 2nd Battalion Worcestershire Regiment (31st Foot). In 1894, the Worcestershires were replaced by the 2nd Battalion the Hampshire Regiment (67th Foot). The Curragh was a little isolated, which led to stringent regulations about taxi fares. However, the camp was well provided for, with recreational facilities (including, for the officers, hunting with the local gentry), several postal deliveries a day (last collection for England at 11 pm), and a daily Mass for Catholics at the East Church. A gun was fired every day at reveille, at 1 pm and at 9.30 pm.Irish Military Guide, Major E Whyte [a directory published monthly]  Wrens of the Curragh  Two anonymous 'Wren of the Curragh' The Wrens of the Curragh were a community of women, who lived close to the Camp, in order that many of the women could be paid for sex work by the soldiers there. The Camp, like many military garrisons in Ireland at the time, had a particular problem with prostitution and was mentioned in the British Parliament's Contagious Disease Acts, which allowed the authorities to stop and arrest women if they suspected them of being prostitutes. The women lived in the furze-covered areas surrounding the camp, living in holes in banks and ditches with few possessions, in what were known as 'nests'. Their story gained prominence in a series of articles in the Pall Mall Gazette by the English journalist James Greenwood in 1867. His book The Seven Curses of London also contains a chapter on the Wrens. The problem of sexually transmitted diseases due to the prevalence of prostitution and men willing to partake in their services can be seen by the numbers reporting with gonorrhea in the military hospital in the 1911 Census.  Cemetery  Curragh Camp fire brigade in 1902 The Curragh Cemetery has many graves that attest to the British Army presence on the Curragh up to their departure in 1922. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission maintains the graves of 104 servicemen who died at the camp during World War I, which are scattered throughout the cemetery.  Handover  At the time of the passage of the Home Rule Act in 1914, the Camp became the scene of the Curragh incident, where a number of officers proposed to resign rather than enforce Home Rule against the will of the Unionists. After the Anglo-Irish War (21 January 1919 – 11 July 1921) the British Army handed over Curragh Camp to the Irish Free State Army. The handover took place at 10 o'clock on Tuesday 16 May 1922, when the camp was handed over to a party of Irish troops commanded by Lieutenant General O'Connell. On Monday evening the Union Flag was lowered for the last time. At noon, O'Connell climbed the water tower and hoisted the first Irish tricolour to fly over the Curragh Camp. By tradition the British Army had cut down the flagpole requiring the Irish officers to physically hold the flagpole while the tricolour was raised. Both the Union Flag and the tricolour, which measures are now preserved in the DFTC.  Civil War executions  In December 1922 seven men were executed in the Curragh Military Prison. The Leinster Leader of 23 December 1922 reported that a column of ten men had operated against railways, goods trains and shops in the vicinity of Kildare for some time. Five of them had apparently taken part in an attempt to disrupt communications by derailing engines on 11 December. Two engines had been taken from a shed at Kildare and one of them had been sent down the line into an obstruction at Cherryville, thereby blocking the line. It was also alleged that goods trains had been looted and shops robbed in the locality. The same column was also reported to have taken part in an ambush of Free State troops at the Curragh siding on 25 November. On 13 December the men were surprised in a dug-out at a farmhouse at Moore's Bridge, on the edge of the Curragh plains, by Free State troops. In the dug-out were ten men, ten rifles, a quantity of ammunition, and other supplies. The men were arrested and conveyed to the Curragh. The proprietress of the farmhouse was also arrested and lodged in Mountjoy Prison. Controversy surrounds the circumstances of the death of Thomas Behan, one of the men. One version has it that his arm was broken when he was being apprehended and he was subsequently killed by a blow of a rifle butt on the head at the scene of the raid when he was unable to climb on the truck that conveyed the men to the Curragh. The official version was that he was shot when attempting to escape from a hut in which he was detained in the Curragh Camp. Those that were executed: * Stephen White (18) Abbey Street, Kildare * Joseph Johnston (18) Station Road, Kildare * Patrick Mangan (22) Fair Green, Kildare * Patrick Nolan (34) Rathbride, Kildare * Brian Moore (37) Rathbride, Kildare * James O’Connor (24) Bansha, Co. Tipperary * Patrick Bagnall (19) Fair Green, Kildare A memorial to the executed men can be found in Kildare Town. The Curragh Camp viewed from the surrounding Curragh plain The Emergency During The Emergency (1939-1946), internment of republicans was again instituted by the Fianna Fáil Government of Éamon de Valera. As a result, IRA members who were arrested by the Garda Síochána were interned in the Curragh for the duration of hostilities. The camp was usually called Tin Town (Baile an Stáin or an Bhaile Stáin) by the internees. According to historian Tim Pat Coogan, around 2,000 IRA men passed time in the internment camp during the war years. According to Coogan: > \\"Gaeltachts, peopled entirely by Irish-speaking internees, were set up and > Máirtín Ó Cadhain ran highly successful language classes. Other prisoners > who had more education than these fellows gave tutorials in their own > special subjects, and many a young country lad who had left school at age > twelve emerged from the Curragh with a far better education than he could > possibly have acquired any other way.\\"Coogan (1994), pp. 147–148 Also according to Coogan, the years in internment left a great mark on the IRA veterans who remained there for long. > \\"Most men, on leaving the internment camp, were so unable to deal with > ordinary life that it took upwards of six months before any of them could > screw up their courage to do normal things such as signing on at the Labour > Exchange to draw unemployment benefits or applying for jobs. Even to cross > the road was a terrible effort, the traffic, thin anough after the war, > seemed fantastic after the years in the Curragh. The difference in women's > fashion frightened them and added to the general air of unfamiliarity. After > years in confinement with adult men, children seemed fragile and small > scale. Most remained republicans in sympathy, but had no means of solving > the border problem. Some were broken and turned to drink or had nervous > breakdowns.\\"Coogan (1994), p. 145 Internment of belligerents It was also used to intern Allied and Axis personnel who had found themselves in Ireland during World War II. There were three sections in the camp at the time: one each for the IRA, Allied airmen and German mariners and airmen. British personnel were interned at the Curragh, whereas US personnel were repatriated due to an agreement between the Irish and US governments, though one US citizen, Roland Wolfe, whose nationality had been stripped by the US Government for fighting with the British (in No. 133 Squadron RAF) prior to the US entry to the war, was also interned. The British and US \\"Internees\\" at the Curragh were not always strictly contained, and many were allowed to attend social events outside the detention camp. There is a movie about the World War II detention camp, called \\"The Brylcreem Boys\\". Modern Curragh Camp The Curragh Camp is home to the Defence Forces Training Centre The Curragh Camp is now home to the Defence Forces Training Centre of the Irish Defence Forces, housing the Command and Staff School, the Cadet School, the Infantry School, the Combat Support College, the Combat Services Support College, the Equitation School, a logistics base, a supply and services unit, and the United Nations School. The Curragh Camp has seen modernisation in late 20th and early 21st century, with billet blocks being refurbished and dining and messing facilities upgraded for all ranks. Other developments include a workshop complex and a large garage for MOWAG Piranha APCs. The tallest building in the Curragh is the fire station, where the army maintain a modern fire fighting service.

The story stars G.I. pilot Rafaella \\"Rafe\\" Blue and her robot Gabe. The title refers to the 86th Air Support Reconnaissance Squadron, a \\"dumping ground for every failure and freak\\" (including Nort turncoats), who are stationed in the Acoma System (\\"A-Hole\\"), an important Souther mining operation.  Characters  *Rafaelle Blue or Rafe is the main character. She is G.I. doll fighter pilot and is immune to over twelve thousand known toxins and poison gases. She has a memory implant based around Rogue, programmed to assist her in a mission she doesn't know about and which regularly talks to her. Recently she has caught an infection from Nort zombies, which has mutated her implant to the extent it has its own agenda. She has few friends and has assisted the Norts against the Grendel assassin out of a principle of outcasts sticking together. *Gabe is Rafe's robot who assists her on her missions, with a personality matrix \\"designed by a bunch of bored frathouse boys\\". She is used to hack devices and may have weapons. She has apparently been fried by Japeth on the Nort asteroid. *Commander Harrigan is the chain-smoking Squadron Commander of the base. She is the one who sent Rafe to the infected Nort base, for the reason that Rafe is immune to most chemicals, toxins and poisons. She's a deeply unpleasant and misanthropic figure, and has shown annoyance that the Acoma struggle is seen by Milli-Com as \\"one of the crappy wars nobody really cares about\\". *Elson is a womanizing fighter pilot who introduced Rafe to the Citadel. He appears friendly and was the only one showing genuine concern when she was in danger in Prog 1483 (wanting to go in and retrieve her). *Kristos is the base PSI. He is one of the only friends Rafe has got on the base but we have yet to discover more of him. Odds on him being the base's Nort spy at seven to one. *Becca Hunter is a Flight Leader. She is haunted by the deaths of her family at Nort hands, leading to heavy drug usage and an obsessive belief she's hearing the screams of the dead in her comms. She shows extreme viciousness and nearly faced the death penalty after firing on a Nort ship that had surrendered. She was instead sent to the 86ers, secretly on a mission for Colonel Kovert... *Stalov and the Norts have switched sides after their Klan attempted (and failed) in a coup. Stalov actually betrayed his Klan-Marshal, believing klan rivalries and coups were damaging Nortland's war effort; it does not appear that his comrades know this. They are mistrusted and disliked by all at Acoma, and have deliberately baited Becca with stories of their kills on Nu-Karthage. Recently, they were targets of a Nort Grendel assassin and turned to Rafe for help. *Doctor Friedkin is the most mysterious character who seems to be keeping progress of Rafe in the base. Originally a geneticist on the GI project, he turned to Xeno-Archaeology and an obsession with elder races after encountering a vast, biological alien ship in a jump gate accident. In Sub 17, at the lower tunnels he is trying to open the thing seen in the Nort base as an archaeological dig, although it may be the thing that caused the infection. An illness (Progeria) is causing him to age at an accelerated rate. *Japeth is a mysterious alien hybrid who saved Rafe from the Nort base, although he apparently killed Rafe's robot Gabe. His reason for saving her was \\"it isn't her time yet\\". *Security Chief Montuez is working with Friedkin in the conspiracy. He views Rafe as a \\"gene-freak\\".  Plot  The Acoma System is a Souther-held warzone. It is centered around a gas giant (also called Acoma) with ore-rich moons, and thus is a valuable mining site for the Souther war effort. Protecting the supply routes is the 86th Air Support Reconnaissance Squadron - the 86ers. It is a dumping ground for failures and freaks and now G.I. Rafaella Blue has joined them. The 86ers are based out of the Citadel, a fortress built on an asteroid inhabited by the alien Termies (\\"Pretty harmless, as long as you don't go wandering about the lower levels on your own\\"). It is known a Nort spy is on the base, with the crew betting on who it might be. The alien Varr live nearby; little is known about them and they leave the 86ers alone for the most part. Rafe was sent to investigate an SOS at a Nort base that had been hit by a bioweapon and was infected by Nort zombies, discovering in the process that the base was a science station researching an alien sarcophagus. The base was destroyed by the Varr but Friedkin's conspiracy knows about the sarcophagus and has one of their own; Harrigan is unaware of this. Recovering from her infection, Rafe experienced visions related to an implanted memory program - with the face of Rogue Trooper - who's attempting to activate her memories and black-ops programming to help an unknown employer working within the base. An assassin tried to kill her with a Nort serum, only to be shot by Harrigan; this assassin is unrelated to the Conspiracy, meaning another network is active at Acoma. Since this story, the Nort turncoats have been targeted by a Grendel - a genetically modified assassin - and Nort forces have begun massing for a major assault on Acoma. The first page of the strip showed Rafe's ship damaging and crashing on Acoma. The rest of the plot occurred \\"seven months earlier\\" and it is not yet known what will cause Rafe to be in that situation.  Conspiracy  This secret group of Souther scientists and personnel (led by Doctor Friedkin and Montuez) are responsible for extravating a (presumably crashed) Varr. They appear to be responsible for the murder of a Souther spy, Cochran. They have also been made aware of the Norts' interest in Rafaella Blue. In Prog 2007, it is discovered that their true goal is to open a tomb consisting of Old Ones on Acoma and gain the secret of immortality, and they are constantly sending teams to investigate it (which are slaughtered by unknown beings). They secretly have one of the Old Ones in stasis, gained from the sarcophagus.

This station provides primary coverage for nine counties in the western Illinois and northeastern Missouri region. It is owned by the University of Missouri St. Louis and serves as a semi-satellite of KWMU in St. Louis. WQUB coverage map This coverage map is WQUB-FMs propagation curves indicating distances to a particular field strength. Below results are indicative of the FCC's contours for City Grade, Grade A, and Grade B for WQUB-FM. WQUB-FM service contours for 70 dBuV/m indicates a strong signal while the 54 dBuV/m contour is the edge of our coverage. Be aware that WQUB-FM can often be heard in locations beyond the edge service contour, but that service is not protected from interference caused by other stations. History WQUB began in 1948 as WWQC, a carrier current on the campus of Quincy University, then known as Quincy College. In 1974, the college was granted a full license for a 10-watt station which went on the air in 1979. Its coverage area was effectively limited to the area around Francis Hall on campus. In 1983, power was boosted to 100 watts, enough to cover the campus. The response was strong enough that the school began an effort to upgrade the station, culminating in becoming a full NPR member in 1988, not long after the school won university status. Power was also increased to 10,000 watts. The station increased its power to the current 28,000 watts in 2000. However, the station had never attracted much community support. At one point, listener support only accounted for 10 percent of its operating costs—a very low number even for such a small market. In 2009, Quincy University transferred operational control of the station to area NBC affiliate WGEM-TV and laid off two staff members. Even with these measures, Quincy University was finding it difficult to sustain the station in the economic climate, and in the spring of 2012 decided to get out of broadcasting and redirect more of its resources into academics. In hopes of preserving public radio in the Tri-State, it sold WQUB to UMSL in May 2012.St. Louis Public Radio to acquire Illinois station. Current, 2012-05-29. The sale officially closed on July 26, 2012. Before the sale, WQUB aired a mix of NPR news and talk, classical music, alternative music and jazz.

The Encyclopedia of the British Press 1422–1992, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 404 usually known as Kingsley Martin, was a British journalist who edited the left-leaning political magazine the New Statesman from 1930 to 1960.  Early life  The son of a socialist and pacifist Congregationalist minister, and younger brother of the housing reformer Irene Barclay, Martin grew up with a strong political influence in his life.William Fitter \\"Portrait of an Editor\\" (Review of Kingsley by C.H. Rolph), The Sydney Morning Herald, 3 June 1973. p. 46 After primary school he earned a scholarship to Mill Hill School. While still at school, Martin became liable to conscription. Being a pacifist, he was a conscientious objector to the First World War and refused to fight in it, but he did not object to serving as a non-military medical orderly caring for wounded soldiers, joining the Friends' Ambulance Unit in June 1916, and in 1918 was sent to the Western Front to serve with them. After the war he returned to academic life at Magdalene College, Cambridge. While studying at the college he became politically active and joined many groups such as the Union of Democratic Control and the Fabian Society. After obtaining his degree, Martin moved to the US to teach at Princeton University for a year. When he returned to England, Martin was hired as a book reviewer for the journal The Nation. His employer also used his connections to get him a teaching job at the London School of Economics, under Harold Laski. As well as a new job, Kingsley also managed to publish one of his earliest books, The Triumph of Lord Palmerston. Martin remained at the LSE for three years, before he was offered a job as a leader writer at the Manchester Guardian. Martin accepted, and during his time there he published another work; French Liberal Thought in the Eighteenth Century.  Editor of the New Statesman  He became editor of the New Statesman in 1930, taking up the post at the beginning of 1931. With Martin as editor, the New Statesman (renamed New Statesman and Nation after absorbing The Nation in 1931) became a significant influence on Labour politics. Martin was originally a pacifist, writing after the 1938 Anschluss: \\"Today if Mr. Chamberlain would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of Little Englandism in which the Empire was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him\\".Neville Thompson, The Anti-Appeasers (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), pp. 156–157. Martin later abandoned this position in response to the rise of fascism in the 1930s.Cole, Margaret. \\"Kindly Dissenter\\", Tribune, 28 January 1966. During this period, Martin and the Statesman were criticised for pursuing an erratic response to the regime of Stalin in the Soviet Union. Martin's friend John Maynard Keynes complained that in regard to Stalin's Russia, Martin was \\"a little too full perhaps of goodwill. When a doubt arises it is swallowed down if possible.\\"Bill Jones The Russia complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977, p. 25, 100 Martin wrote a hostile account of Leon Trotsky, \\"Trotsky in Mexico\\" for the NS, and did not allow the magazine to review Trotsky's anti- Stalinist book The Revolution Betrayed.Bashir Abu-Manneh, Fiction of the New Statesman, Lexington Books, 2011. , (pp. 169–70). Despite all this, the circulation of the Statesman grew from 14,000 to 80,000 over the course of Martin's thirty years in the editor's chair. Martin supported the policy of demanding an unconditional surrender from the Nazis during the Second World War. Martin became disillusioned with the Soviet Union after the Hitler–Stalin Pact, which he denounced; in response the Communist Party Daily Worker ran an editorial attacking Martin.Jones, (1977) (p. 40). After attending the Soviet- sponsored World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław, Poland, in 1948, Martin wrote a hostile account of the conference, entitled \\"Hyenas and other Reptiles\\".Jones, (1977) (pp. 194–5). Kingsley Martin remained at the New Statesman until 1960 when he retired.  Dispute with Orwell  Martin's editorship resulted in what D. J. Taylor called a \\"titanic feud\\" with contributor George Orwell.\\"The Orwell Wars\\", D.J. Taylor and Adrian Smith. New Statesman, 12–25 April 2013. Returning to the UK after fighting in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell contacted Martin and offered to give him an account of the conflict; Martin accepted the offer. However, Martin rejected Orwell's first article, \\"Eyewitness in Spain\\", on the grounds it could undermine the Spanish Republicans. As compensation, Martin then offered Orwell a chance to review Franz Borkenau's book The Spanish Cockpit. However, Martin and the literary editor Raymond Mortimer turned down Orwell's review on the grounds that \\"it is very uncompromisingly said and implies that our Spanish correspondents are all wrong\\" and that it was more a restatement of Orwell's opinions than a review.David Caute, Politics and the Novel During the Cold War. Transaction Publishers, 2009 , (pp. 46–7) Mortimer later wrote to Orwell to apologise for the rejection of his articles on Spain: \\"There is no premium here on Stalinist orthodoxy\\". Orwell never forgave Martin for the rejection; although he continued to write for the New Statesman, he often made \\"wounding remarks\\" in his journalism about the magazine being \\"under direct communist influence\\" and its readers being \\"worshippers of Stalin\\". Orwell also included Martin's name in a list of \\"fellow travellers\\" he passed on to the Information Research Department, a branch of UK intelligence.Frances Stonor Saunders, Who Paid the Piper?: The CIA and the Cultural Cold War, 1999, Granta, .

The Crown and The Establishment caused considerable controversy, with Gerald Nabarro condemning Martin's views on the monarchy as \\"scurrilous\\".\\"Attack on Queen Stirs Row\\", The Sun (Vancouver), 28 May 1962, p. 1  Personal life  Martin married Olga Walters; they divorced in 1940. Martin then became romantically involved with the activist Dorothy Woodman. They remained together for the rest of his life, although they never married. Martin worked with Woodman in pressure groups such as the anti-militarist Union of Democratic Control and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.  Later life  In his last years he published two autobiographical works, Father Figures (1966) and Editor (1968). Reviewing Father Figures, Margaret Cole described Martin as a \\"wonderfully good editor\\".

It was previously affiliated with ESPN Radio; however, in 2005, ESPN moved its affiliation to WNFN (then WNPL), an FM station. WNSR is currently affiliated with CBS Sports Radio. Many of the top names in Nashville sports have worked at WNSR. Greg Pogue, who is a veteran sports writer, sports editor, and television host, hosted Nashville's longest running morning sports show with David Coleman. Pogue worked with the Nashville Banner and was later sports editor at the Daily News Journal. Pogue took over the morning drive slot after Patrick McMurtry left to take a television news anchor position in Charleston, West Virginia. Darren McFarland, a radio veteran in Nashville, hosted a show during two different stints at the station. Brad Hopkins, a former Tennessee Titan, hosted two different shows, the latter as a co-host alongside McFarland. Bill King, a national sports talk show host and recruiting expert, hosted a show with Joe Biddle, a sports writer with the former Nashville Banner and later The Tennessean. Gregory Ruff, a veteran broadcaster in Nashville, worked in various roles with the station hosting a show and later being the fill-in for many of the shows. Jonathan Shaffer has also worked at the station. Chip Ramsey was one of the early broadcasters who did a show. Mike Wolf had an eclectic program at one point. Don West hosted an afternoon radio show that featured various other co-hosts including David Boclair, Eric Yutzy, Steve Wrigley, and Paul Kuharsky. (West was also a popular shopping channel show host and later announcer for TNA Wrestling.) Long-time Nashville sports broadcasting figure George Plaster joined the station's staff in September 2019. Listening area WNSR is licensed to the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, Tennessee in adjoining Williamson County. Its 4,500-watt daytime signal is transmitted from a four-tower antenna in eastern Williamson County in a north-northeast/south-southeast directional pattern; this is due in part to the 5,000-watt daytime signal of a much older Class B 560 kHz station, WHBQ, just under 200 airline miles away in Memphis. As a result, WNSR's signal can be very difficult to receive in Nashville's eastern and especially western suburbs, but the station can be heard clearly from as far away as South Central Kentucky and North Alabama between sunrise and sunset. At night, when WHBQ has a 1,000-watt signal, WNSR broadcasts at an even more limited level of power (75 watts) from a nondirectional, one-tower antenna just southeast of downtown Nashville. Thus, the station's nighttime signal does not fully encompass the entire metropolitan area. However, the listening area has been effectively enlarged by the purchase of WPDQ (formerly WNTC), a Class A FM station licensed to Drakesboro, Kentucky, considerably north of the traditional Nashville market area, which now simulcasts WNSR programming, putting it into the Clarksville/Hopkinsville market area. In addition, the station also signed on over translator station W240CA (95.9 FM), which serves the Nashville/Davidson County area and the Williamson County area, including the Brentwood, Franklin, and some parts of Spring Hill, Tennessee areas. Programming WNSR currently is in affiliation with CBS Sports Radio. The station was previously affiliated with Yahoo! Sports Radio (formerly Sporting News Radio, and Sports Fan Radio Network prior to that) and NBC Sports Radio. The NBC Sports Radio affiliation has since relocated to WQZQ. The station also broadcasts local sports, both talk shows and play-by-play as well. On July 31, 2009, it was announced that WNSR would broadcast Middle Tennessee State University football and men's basketball games. This affiliation began with the start of the 2009 football season. However, the affiliation with Middle Tennessee State University ended when the school moved their sports coverage to WPRT-FM, beginning with the 2013 football season. WNSR now serves as the primary affiliate for Vanderbilt University baseball and women's basketball programs.

Plot The River follows the tranquil life of lovable, Cockney, ex-convict Davey Jackson (Essex) who is lock keeper on the canal near the village of Chumley-on-the-Water. His peaceful life is turned upside down by the arrival of the neurotic, sharp-tongued Sarah MacDonald (Murphy). Over the six episodes of the series the love-hate relationship between Davey and Sarah blossoms into a shaky romance, their potential happiness often spoiled by the machinations of Davey's cunning Aunty Betty (Vilma Hollingbery) and the hapless intervention of Davey's deputy Tom Pike (Shaun Scott). The River also shows brief glimpses of the village of Chumley and its extremely weird inhabitants, including the eccentric squire, Colonel Danvers (David Ryall), the constantly silent and drunken Silent Jim, landlord of the village pub \\"The Ferret\\", Aunty Betty's futile attempts to lead a socialist revolution from the village and Tom's conversations with his pets Deidre the goat and Cyril the pig. The only two (nearly) sane people in Chumley are Davey and Sarah, the former taking the chaotic and confusing village life in his stride, the latter realising that she isn't the greatest crackpot in the country. The River ends abruptly with Sarah's decision to leave, partly due to her nervousness about her relationship with Davey and the ploys of Aunty Betty to get rid of her. At the very end of Episode Six, Sarah's narrowboat explodes after Tom forgets to replace a faulty gas pipe on it. Sarah, much to Davey's relief, survives (and is found floating on a piece of wreckage in the river). The episode ends with Davey and Sarah floating down the river on the remains of the narrowboat. Production The River was first shown on BBC1 in late 1988 and repeated in July/August 1989. Chumley-on-the-Water is a fictional location for the filming. In reality, it was filmed at Wootton Rivers on the Kennet and Avon Canal near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The producer/director of The River, Susan Belbin, claimed that the series wasn't meant to be a sitcom but a romantic comedy, the relationship between Davey and Sarah being the main focus of the programme. The outcome was different from Belbin's aim, however, as The River became more of a sitcom and the Davey-Sarah relationship became a strand of the programme. Despite being heavily trailed by BBC One and moderate ratings for the first episode, the series was not a success. Essex later commented in an interview that he put it down to \\"the series not knowing quite what it wanted to be... nor indeed the BBC (knowing what they wanted it to be) either\\", also suggesting the series had suffered from poor direction and \\"wasn't what (he) had initially signed up for\\". Whilst the prospect of a second series at first seemed possible during filming, Essex stated that \\"...About three quarters of the way through the filming, I think it became apparent that we were going to be a one-run affair, as (the series) just didn't hang together well enough\\".

The Feilong-7 has an effective range of 32 kilometers and a speed of Mach 1.4. It has powerful anti-jamming capability and its supersonic flight makes terminal interception difficult. The warhead of the FL-7 can pierce solid armor and destroy large and medium-sized surface warships. This missile can be roughly considered as the supersonic counterpart of the subsonic C-704 anti-ship missile. The missile is powered by a liquid fuel rocket motor and a solid rocket booster, which is under the airframe at the rear. Along with C-101, FL-7 competed for the air-launched supersonic anti-ship missile program in China during the 1990s. However, C-101 was selected because it flies at faster speed and its range is nearly a third greater than that of FL-7, while it only weighs slightly heavier. Being the last Chinese anti-ship missile with rocket motor powered by liquid fuel, the role of FL-7 is decreasing, but not yet immediately phased out. The reason is that the Chinese coastal defense doctrine when using anti-ship missiles: multi-direction, multi-altitude, multiple waves attacks on targets with both supersonic and subsonic anti-ship missiles to make it difficult for the targets to defend itself from such saturated attacks, FL-7 is thus still have a little role to play in such saturated attacks at shorter range. However, it is safe to conclude that as newer missiles becoming widely available, the role of FL-7 would continuously decrease to its eventual retirement. Western sources have claimed in 1996, with Chinese help in the forms of technology sales, that Iran had begun indigenous production of a medium-range anti-ship missile, based on the technologies of FL-7. *Length: 6.59 m *Diameter: 0.54 m *Weight: 1,770 kg *Wingspan: 1.86 m *Warhead: 360 kg *Speed: > Mach 1.4 *Range: 32 km max. *Guidance: active radar homing seeker (Other types of seekers being developed) *Propulsion: one liquid rocket engine with a solid rocket booster References *FL-7 *FL(Feilong-7) Category:Anti-ship cruise missiles of the People's Republic of China Category:Weapons of the People's Republic of China Category:Air-to-surface missiles Category:Anti-tank missiles of the People's Republic of China ","title":"FL-7"},{"id":"4489230","text":"GA-7 can mean: *Georgia's 7th congressional district *Georgia State Route 7 *Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar twin-engined light aircraft ","title":"GA-7"},{"id":"4489232","text":"GA-8 or GA 8 can refer to: *GippsAero GA8 Airvan – 8-seat utility aircraft *Georgia's 8th congressional district *Georgia State Route 8 ","title":"GA-8"},{"id":"4489234","text":"The historic Old Patent Office Building in Washington, D.C. covers an entire city block defined by F and G Streets and 7th and 9th Streets NW in Chinatown. It served as one of the earliest United States Patent Office buildings. After undergoing extensive renovations, the building reopened on July 1, 2006 and was renamed The Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture in honor of a gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. The building houses two Smithsonian Institution museums: the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. History Old Patent Office Building, ca. 1846 Designed in the Greek Revival style by architect Robert Mills, construction started in 1836, and the massive structure took 31 years to complete. United States patent law required inventors to submit scale models of their inventions, which were retained by the Patent Office and required housing. Once home to many early government departments, including the first exhibits of the Smithsonian, today the structure houses two museums of the Smithsonian Institution, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. In Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's plan for the capital city, the site of the Patent Office Building, halfway between the Capitol and the President's House, was set aside for a monumental structure. L'Enfant envisaged a nondenominational \\"church of the Republic\\", which he later modified to a Pantheon devoted to great Americans. Mill's described the proportions of the Greek Revival central portico as \\"exactly those of the Parthenon of Athens\\", a departure in Washington, where previously ambitious public buildings had been based on Roman and Renaissance precedents. Fireproofing the design was an essential concern: Mills spanned the interior spaces with masonry vaulting without the use of wooden beams. Skylights and interior light courts filled the spaces with daylight. Vignette the Old US Patent Office Building from an 1880s patent certificate. After years of political infighting, in which Congressional committees questioned Mills' competence and insisted on design changes that inserted unnecessary supporting columns and tie-rods, Mills was summarily dismissed in 1851. Construction continued under the direction of Thomas U. Walter, one of Mills' harshest criticsIn the fire of 1877, Mill's much-criticized vaulted ceilings, which Walter had predicted would fail in case of fire, held intact, while Walter's iron-reinforced vaults collapsed. and was completed in 1865. The building's west wing suffered a fire in 1877, destroying some 87,000 patent models; it was restored by Adolf Cluss, 1877–1885, in the style he termed \\"modern Renaissance\\". See Patent Office 1877 fire. From 1854 to 1857, Clara Barton worked in the building as a clerk to the Patent Commissioner, the first woman federal employee to receive equal pay. During the Civil War, the building was turned into military barracks, hospital, and morgue. Wounded soldiers lay on cots in second-floor galleries, among glass cases holding models of inventions that had been submitted with patent applications. The American poet Walt Whitman frequented \\"that noblest of Washington buildings\\" and read to wounded men. The building was chosen as the venue for Lincoln's Second Inaugural Ball in 1865. Whitman worked in Bureau of Indian Affairs, located in the building, from January 24 to June 30, 1865, before being fired for having a copy of Leaves of Grass in his desk. In the 20th century, the building was occupied by the Patent Office until 1932; it then housed the Civil Service Commission. A street-widening sliced away the monumental stairs to its south portico. In 1953, legislation was introduced to demolish the building for a parking lot; but President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation giving it to the Smithsonian in 1958. This was an important victory for the historic preservation movement in the United States. The Faulkner, Kingsbury & Stenhouse firm of architects supervised the renovation of the interior as museum space starting in 1964. In 1965, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark. The National Museum of American Art (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum) and the National Portrait Gallery opened in January 1968. The north wing housed the art museum and the south wing housed the portrait gallery. Office space and a cafe occupied the east wing. The center courtyard had outdoor eating space for the cafe and several large trees. 2000-2007 renovation In 1995, the Smithsonian revealed the Old Patent Office Building was in serious disrepair. The roof leaked, netting had to be placed in some galleries to catch falling ceiling plaster, window frames were rotting, the floor tiles in the Great Hall were crumbling, and the exterior facade was so degraded it was shedding fist-sized pieces of rock.Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"The Dilapidated State of the Nation's Attic.\\" The Washington Post.

The 2000-2006 renovation included restoring the porticos modeled after the Parthenon in Athens, a curving double staircase, colonnades, vaulted galleries, large windows, and skylights as long as a city block. According to the Smithsonian Institution, \\"Extraordinary effort was made to use new preservation technologies to restore the historic fabric of the building and re-use historic materials.\\" Prior to the building's closure in January 2000, a decision was reached to allot about one-third of the building's total space to the National Portrait Gallery while simultaneously eliminating the informal north-south division between the NPG and American Art Museum.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"The Old Patent Office, Pending Renewal.\\" Washington Post. January 1, 2000. This led to acrimony between the two museums, and a public debate about which collection deserved more space. The Smithsonian resolved the dispute practically: Art that best fit an exhibition space got it.

Smithsonian officials subsequently began discussing a major change to the renovation design: Adding a glass roof to the open courtyard in the center of the Old Patent Office Building. Congress approved the change in August 2003. In March 2004, the Smithsonian announced that Foster and Partners, would design the glass canopy.; ; Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Way Clear for British Architect's Glass Act\\". The Washington Post. March 16, 2004. In November, Robert Kogod (a real estate development executive) and his wife, Arlene (heir to Charles E. Smith Construction fortune) donated $25 million to complete the canopy. By then, costs had risen to $298 million with $60 million in private funds still to be raised. In early November 2004, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC; which has statutory authority to approve all buildings and renovations in the D.C. metropolitan area) approved the preliminary design for the glass canopy. The United States Commission of Fine Arts, an advisory commission on design, approved the canopy in January 2005.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Panel Rejects Smithsonian Plan For Patent Office\\". The Washington Post. June 3, 2005. Delays in obtaining final NCPC approval and construction materials for the canopy led to a major delay in the roof's installation. The Smithsonian said in April 2005 that the canopy would not be ready by the time the museum reopened in July 2006, and would be installed in 2007. But opposition to the canopy was rising. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), a federal agency, opposed enclosing the courtyard; the height of the canopy above the cornice line; the bright lighting of the canopy; and the destruction of the landscaping, fountains, and trees in the courtyard. Opposition was also expressed by the United States Department of the Interior, the D.C. State Preservation Office, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Foster and Partners reduced the height of the canopy and altered the way it would be lit in response to these complaints. They also redesigned the canopy to rest on eight steel pillars rather than resting on the roof of the building. The ACHP said the height and lighting changes were not enough, and that the pillars detracted from the beauty of the courtyard. The design changes, coupled with inflation, raised the cost of the canopy to $50 million from $38 million by April 2005.Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Patent Office Roof: Pending\\". The Washington Post. April 25, 2005. The Kogod Courtyard in 2012. Surprisingly, the NCPC reversed its two previous preliminary approvals and rejected the design for the glass canopy on June 2, 2005. NCPC officials said they were convinced by the concerns raised by preservationists, and condemned the Smithsonian's design approval process for being exclusionary. The 6-to-5 vote forced work to come to a halt on the courtyard and canopy, and required that the Smithsonian restore the courtyard to its original appearance (including reinstallation of two iron fountains). The decision cost the Smithsonian $8 million.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"Cost of Reversal on Patent Office $8 Million, Smithsonian Says\\". The Washington Post. June 9, 2005, Subscription required. Unwilling to lose the canopy, the Smithsonian brought five alternatives to the NCPC on August 4. Two included a glass canopy with flat roofs. Three others lowered the canopy by an additional and redirected the lighting to avoid creating a beacon-like effect for the canopy at night. All the alternatives changed the proposed landscaping of the new courtyard and added water features. At least one retained the iron fountains.Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Old Patent Office Options Clearly Still Favor Glass\\". The Washington Post. August 5, 2005, Subscription required. Washington Post architectural critic Benjamin Forgey described the changes as \\"relatively minor adjustments\\" and \\"pretty much the very same design\\". On September 8, 2005, the NCPC reversed itself yet again. It voted 9-to-2 to accept an alternative which retained the waving glass canopy, eight steel columns (unchanged from the previous design), and nighttime illumination of the previous design. The NCPC also approved the preliminary courtyard landscape design, which was created by noted landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson. Almost none of the complaints raised by historic preservationists were addressed.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"A Roof That's Patently the Best Option\\". The Washington Post. September 9, 2005, Subscription required. The delay cost the Smithsonian $10 million. In October 2005, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation made another major gift, donating $45 million to finish both the building renovation and the canopy manufacture and installation (now scheduled to be complete in July 2007 or later).Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Smithsonian Scores a $45 Million Gift\\". The Washington Post. October 12, 2005, Subscription required. The Smithsonian agreed to call the two museums, the conservation center, courtyard, storage facility, and other operations within the Old Patent Office complex the \\"Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture\\" in appreciation for the gift. In addition, the Smithsonian said it would call its conservation laboratory the Lunder Conservation Center after receiving a $5.7 million grant from the Harold Alfond Foundation, name the new 356-seat underground auditorium after Nan Tucker McEvoy; designate the courtyard the Robert and Arlene Kogod Courtyard; and name its \\"open storage\\" facility the Luce Foundation Center. The two museums would retain their names, however. The Reynolds Foundation donation left just $20 million to be raised.Trescott, Jacqueline. \\"Smithsonian Thanks Its Big Donor By Name\\". The Washington Post. October 13, 2005, Subscription required. The National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian American Art Museum reopened on July 1, 2006. The total cost of the building's renovation was $283 million. The $63 million courtyard won rave reviews. Washington Post critic Philip Kennicott called the courtyard a \\"compelling and peaceful public space\\". Historic preservationists, he observed, were wrong in assuming the glass canopy would turn attention away from the building. To the contrary, he said, \\"the glass canopy enhances it, drawing out the sandy color and texture of the south wing...and the greenish- gray granite hues of the north wing\\" and allowing the details and lines of the building to come into higher relief. He called the courtyard's landscaping \\"resplendent\\" and the four floor-level water scrims \\"captivating\\". He concluded, \\"Now that it's finished, it's unfortunate that the canopy isn't more visible from the outside (you need to be above street level, in an adjacent building, to see it clearly, and it can be glimpsed peeking above the roofline if seen from a few blocks away). Opponents of the canopy helped ensure that it would be all but invisible from the street. They were wrong. It deserves to be seen.\\" It was named one of the \\"new seven wonders of the architecture world\\" by Condé Nast Traveler magazine.

Licensed to Columbus, Nebraska, United States, the station is currently owned by Alpha Media through licensee Digity 3E License, LLC, and features programming from CBS Radio, Salem Communications and Sporting News Radio. The station also features religious and secular talk radio programs such as James Dobson, Woodrow Kroll, Chuck Swindoll and Michael Medved. History George Basil Anderson applied on January 19, 1947, for a new radio station at 900 kHz in Columbus, to operate with 1,000 watts during the day. The Federal Communications Commission approved the application on September 19, 1947, and KJSK signed on April 28, 1948. Among the features on KJSK in its early years was a cooking program hosted by Anderson's wife Florence from her kitchen. The station was noted for its Christian programming. Its flagship offering, The Glorious Gospel Hour, had aired on another Nebraska station for five years prior to the launch of KJSK; it remained on the schedule for 30 years. Basil Anderson would expand his radio holdings to a full station group, known as the Heart of the Nation Stations. In 1964, KJSK-FM 101.1 joined KJSK, offering a second outlet; as with several other Heart of the Nation operations, in 1977, the FM changed to beautiful music as KOXI before a 1984 flip to adult contemporary under its present KLIR call letters. An FM station had been provided for in the construction of KJSK's tower in 1947. Alongside the religious programming that served as KJSK's mainstay, the station was known for airing polka music programming. In 1992, Heartland Broadcasting acquired KJSK and KLIR from the Anderson family for $850,000. Under Heartland, in 1994, KJSK shifted from a religious format to a news/talk station, retaining 20 hours a week of religious programming. It also continued to broadcast polka music, with the second-most air time devoted to polka of any station in the United States in 1999. In 2001, the two stations were sold to Three Eagles Communications, which paid $2.7 million. Digity acquired Three Eagles Communications as part of a 48-station, $66.5 million transaction in 2014.

It is about the service of a Pentecostal community in Scrabble Creek, West Virginia, United States. The church service includes faith healing, snake handling, speaking in tongues and singing. This documentary has entered the public domain and is available at the Internet Archive.  Summary  The documentary begins by showing the audience various images of the church and its night services. After the opening credits, a narrator introduces the Pentecostal community in Scrabble Creek, West Virginia. The narrator presents various activities the church partakes in, such as snake handling, speaking in tongues, and four to six hour long meetings at the church multiple times a week. The narrators explain that while people are commonly bit while handling the snakes, mainly copperheads, they refuse medical help. The documentary then features several one-on-one interviews from various members of the church. These interviews reveal stories of how many of the church's members found salvation through the Holy Ghost and how the Holy Ghost saves them in their daily lives. Some members reveal stories of how they are able to speak in tongues; others reveal how they communicate with God, who sometimes paralyzes them. The final interview is of an old woman who shakes and sometimes convulses on camera while going in and out of speaking in tongues. The film then cuts to the beginning of a church service. As men enter the church, they go up and kiss each other on the lips before they are seated. After everyone is seated, people start clapping and singing together. Then there is a cut to the pastor talking to the congregation. He invites those who have not found the Holy Ghost to find out. He also tells the congregation to ignore the cameraman and to act as though it was just another normal night. The pastor continues his sermon, and the documentary uses various cuts to show that a long period of time has passed. Eventually, the church service moves into a time of prayer. The people stand and announce their prayer concerns to the congregation. The pastor tells people that God will answer their prayers if they only believe. They then bring a woman, who is rapidly losing her eyesight, to the front of the church to pray for. The camera pans to the rest of the church and shows that everyone else has formed into small groups and are all praying at the same time. The different styles of prayer include standing still, lying on the floor, and convulsing seemingly uncontrollably. The end of the film contains a lot of fast cuts in order to show everything that happened in the service. A new man preaches, followed by two people who lead the congregation in worship. After clapping and singing, snakes are brought out to the snake handlers. As the music and clapping continue, people begin to get up and dance. Various people throughout the church handle several snakes, and a man who dances violently quickly collapses to the ground and lies there. No one rushes to help him. The music stops so that people can provide testimonies and the church can take an offering. The pastor handles a snake as he tries to get people to give money to the church. The snake bites the pastor on the hand. The film ends with a shot of the pastor's swollen hand.

Hired in 1995 from Sports Illustrated, where he was a Senior Writer, Telander's presence at the newspaper was expected to counter the stable of sports columnists the rival Chicago Tribune had. Early life Telander is a native of Peoria, Illinois, and attended Richwoods High School, where he was an All- Conference quarterback. He attended Northwestern University on a football scholarship. He played for coach Alex Agase as a cornerback (and punter junior year), making All-Big Ten his senior season and two-time All-Big Ten Academic. His teammates included Mike Adamle, who is also now a member of the Chicago media. Career After graduating from Northwestern, Telander was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1971 but was cut in training camp. He wrote a book about this experience in 2004, Like a Rose, which was made into a short film by NFL Films in 2013. Soon after, he began his career as a freelance writer, becoming a Special Contributor to Sports Illustrated in 1973. It was that year he went to New York and wrote a lengthy piece entitled \`\`They Always Come Home Again’’ about college basketball players who return to their city courts in the summer. The next year he moved to New York, where he played basketball on city playgrounds and wrote the book Heaven Is A Playground, which later was made into a movie starring D.B. Sweeney. In the 1980s, Telander was a Senior Writer at Sports Illustrated and was quickly recognized as a rising star.As the college football beat writer in the mid-1980s, he reported on the scandals that plagued the University of Miami, University of Oklahoma, University of South Carolina, and Southern Methodist University. He also observed what he believed to be hypocrisy by the National Collegiate Athletic Association as the college athletes would help the NCAA and the member schools make money, yet wouldn't share in the wealth. His story about South Carolina’s Tommy Chaikin and the dangers of steroid use, \`\`The Nightmare of Steroids,’’ appeared in SI’s Oct. 24, 1988 issue. Telander's 1990 book The Hundred-Yard Lie addressed the problems in college football. In December 1985, Telander was invited to be a regular panelist on The Sportswriters on TV, a debut weekly show featuring the Chicago Tribune's Bill Jauss, the Daily Southtown's Bill Gleason and former boxing promoter Ben Bentley. Telander was 25 years younger than the three other panelists. The show, the first of its kind, was nationally syndicated and developed a cult following before concluding its run in 2000. While with the Sun-Times, Telander continued writing for Sports Illustrated until 1998, when he signed a deal with ESPN. Telander would regularly contribute to ESPN: The Magazine and ESPN.com, appear on ESPN television shows like The Sports Reporters (which some critics viewed as a knockoff of the Sportswriters on TV), and host a radio program on ESPN radio. After the multi-year deal expired, Telander sporadically would contribute to Sports Illustrated, and host a radio show on WSCR. Telander has won eight Illinois Sportswriter of the Year awards as voted by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. He has had his work collected in The Best American Sportswriting Anthology eight times and over two dozen other anthologies. He has won nine Peter Lisagor awards for sports journalism. He is the author of eight books, one of which, Heaven Is A Playground, was named one of the Ten Best Sports Books of All Time by Playboy Magazine, and one of the 100 Best Sports Books by Sports Illustrated. 2008 Hall of Fame ballot controversy In January 2008, Telander caused controversy by refusing to submit a 2008 baseball Hall of Fame ballot, citing frustration with steroid issues troubling baseball. He mentioned in his January 9, 2008 Chicago Sun- Times column how he could not trust, and therefore could not vote, for anyone on the ballot. Telander used Andre Dawson as an example of someone he does not believe ever used steroids, but could not be certain about. Of note is the fact that Telander voted for two known steroid users, José Canseco and Ken Caminiti, in the previous year's Hall of Fame ballot. He did this, as he wrote in his Sun-Times column, as a protest, arguing that the shame of steroid users and the \\"Steroid Era\\" should be preserved this way for all generations to witness. The fury erupted very publicly after Chicago sports-talk radio show host Mike North took Telander to task while interviewing Andre Dawson on January 9, 2008. Telander eventually called Dawson personally, read his column to the former star, and the issue was laid to rest. Telander wrote an article that Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens should not get in the Hall of Fame because of their use of steroids and that they lack integrity.  Next Year Day  In 2008, Telander partnered with The Heckler and owner Brad Zibung to host the 100th Annual Next Year Day. Nearly 1,000 people attended, including famous Cubs fan Bill Murray, who sang with Telander’s band, the Del-Crustaceans. The 101st Annual Next Year Day was held Friday, April 3, 2009, at Harry Caray's Tavern in Chicago's River North neighborhood. Parties were held until the Cubs won the World Series in 2016.  2011  Former South Carolina assistant coach Jim Washburn, just hired by Philadelphia Eagles, apologizes again for steroid scandal he helped create (and which sent him to prison), as documented in Telander’s SI story with Tommy Chaikin. Ref: CSNPhilly.com, Feb 10, 2011, by Frank Reuben: \`\`Eagle’s Washburn Still Confronting Steroid Nightmare.’’  2014 Awards  Telander was awarded the Ring Lardner Award for Excellence in Sports Journalism by the Union League Club of Chicago.

The codex is considered the second most important witness to the Vulgate text; and is also the oldest complete manuscript witness to the order of the Diatessaron. It is an important witness in any discussion about the authenticity of 1 Corinthians 14:34-35Philip B. Payne, Fuldensis, Sigla for Variants in Vaticanus and 1 Cor 14.34-5, NTS 41 (1995) 251-262. and the Comma Johanneum. It is one of the earliest dated manuscripts of the New Testament. It was corrected until 2 May, 546 AD.F. H. Blackburne Daniell, Victor, Bishop of Capua, in W. Smith and H. Wace, eds., A Dictionary of Christian Biography (4 vols., London, 1877-1887), Vol. 1, p. 1126.  Description  It contains the Diatessaron and 23 canonical books of the New Testament; plus the Epistle to the Laodiceans, and a copy of Jerome's Prologue to the Canonical Gospels. It represents the Italian type of text. The four gospels are harmonised into a single continuous narrative, according to the form of Tatian's Diatessaron.K. Aland & B. Aland, Der Text des Neuen Testaments, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1989, p. 197. Its text is akin to that of Codex Amiatinus.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration, Oxford University Press, New York — Oxford 2005, p. 108. The harmonised gospel text is preceded by a listing of its sections, with a summary of their contents, which was copied unchanged from the Old Latin exemplar. From this it can be determined that the Old Latin source had lacked the Genealogy of Jesus (which Victor inserted); but that the source had included the passage of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery. The sequence of books follows the ordering: * Diatessaron * Pauline epistles ** Romans ** 1-2 Corinthians ** Galatians ** Ephesians ** Philippians ** 1-2 Thessalonians ** Colossians ** Laodiceans ** 1-2 Timothy ** Titus ** Philemon ** Hebrews * Acts of the Apostles * Catholic epistles (usual order) * Book of Apocalypse The section 1 Cor 14:34-35 is placed by the original scribe in the margin in an unusual order, verses 36-40 before 34-35, while the text on the page is the normal order. This section is marked by umlaut in Codex Vaticanus.G. S. Dykes, Using the „Umlauts” of Codex Vaticanus to Dig Deeper, 2006. See: Codex Vaticanus Graece. The Umlauts . Several manuscripts of the Western text-type, placed section 1 Cor 14:34-35 after 1 Cor 14:40 (manuscripts: Claromontanus, Augiensis, Boernerianus, itd, g). Also codex 88, which is not representative of the Western text, placed this section after 1 Cor 14:40. One manuscript of the Vulgate does the same (Codex Reginensis). According to Metzger the evidence of the codex is ambiguous. Perhaps the scribe, without actually deleting verses 34-35 from the text, intended the liturgist to omit them when reading the lesson.Bruce M. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, United Bible Societies: 1994), pp. 499-500. The 1 John text section omits the Comma Johanneum. However, the Vulgate Prologue to the Canonical Epistles includes a direct reference to the heavenly witnesses, with the Prologue written as a first-person note from Jerome to Eustocium. In this Prologue unfaithful translators are criticized for removal of the verse. The Prologue from about 1700 on had often been attacked as a late forgery, not really by Jerome, at the time the earliest known extant Vulgate with the Prologue was about 800 AD. The Prologue was noted to be in the Codex Fuldensis in the mid-to-late 1800s.  History  Victor of Capua (died 554) reports that he found an Old Latin harmony of the Gospels, which he recognised as following Tatian's arrangement of the Diatessaron. He substituted the Vulgate text for the Old Latin, appending the rest of the New Testament books from the standard Vulgate. Boniface acquired the codex and in 745 gave it to the monastic library (Abb. 61), in Fulda, where it remains to the present day (hence the name of the codex).Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament (Oxford 1977), p. 335. It served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in Old High German and Old Saxon. According to Malcolm Parkes, glosses to James are in Boniface's own handwriting. Codex Sangallensis 56 was copied, in the 9th century, from the Diatessaron of the Codex Fuldensis. It also contains some extracts from the Acts of the Apostles.Codex Sangallensis 56 at the Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen (copy of Fuldensis in Diatessaron) Ernst Ranke published the text of the codex in 1868.

It is very similar in appearance to the closely related north Queensland species, Argiope aetherea. A. keyserlingi is commonly found in large populations in suburban parks and gardens, particularly amongst the leaves of Lomandra longifolia. Like many species of orb-web spider, A. keyserlingi shows considerable sexual size dimorphism, with the females being many times larger than the males. Mature females can be seen during the summer months and it is not uncommon to see multiple males on the web of one female. This spider is commonly known as the St Andrew's cross spider, due to the construction of bands of silk forming the arms of an X-shaped cross, similar to the one upon which St. Andrew is traditionally said to have been crucified. Juveniles of this species sometimes build a spiral-shaped pattern of silk. Termed web decorations or stabilimenta, these bands are thought to increase prey capture in this species, however, in other species they have been found to protect the spider against predators. A. keyserlingi is an important model species in studies of spider ecology and behaviour. Using this species scientists have investigated sperm competition, sexual size dimorphism, cryptic female choice, the role of pheromones in mating behaviour and the function and evolution of web decorations. Its main predators in Sydney are mantids and birds.Blamires et al. 2007 Name The Latin species name was chosen to honor arachnologist Eugen von Keyserling. The spider is also commonly called the crucifix spider.

During his tenure, Hassenfeld restored the reputation of Hasbro and surpassed Mattel as the world's largest toy manufacturer. History and early life Stephen was born in Rhode Island to Sylvia Grace (née Kay) and Merrill Hassenfeld. He was the oldest of three siblings, the others being his sister Ellie and the youngest child, Alan. They lived in Providence's east side. He attended Moses Brown School where he was well known as a skilled debater. Accomplishments Stephen's grandfather, Henry Hassenfeld, was a Jewish immigrant from Poland who, with his brother Helal, founded a textile company that sold remnants called Hassenfeld Brothers. The brothers would move on to sell pencil boxes, school supplies, and later, toys. After the success of Mr. Potato Head and G.I. Joe the Hassenfeld Brothers would create Hasbro Industries in 1968, and begin to list on the NYSE. In 1980, Stephen's father Merrill died, and Stephen took over control of Hasbro. From 1980 to 1986, Stephen Hassenfeld increased Hasbro's profitability by 85% annually. Only two Fortune 500 companies have achieved such a high rate of growth in profitability. Forbes magazine rated Hasbro number one in a thousand-corporation survey of increased value during the first half of the 1980s, well ahead of other successful companies such as Wal- Mart and Berkshire Hathaway. In 1983, Hassenfeld established the Hasbro Charitable Trust, and in 1984, he created Hasbro Children's Foundation. The two charities help to improve the lives of children and their families throughout the world by providing management of grant donations in operating areas, product donation, matching gifts to higher education, special community projects, and volunteering. Also, in 1990, the Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders was created. The Children's Center is affiliated with NYU Langone Health, and under its current director, Dr. Elizabeth Raetz has been making remarkable strides in alleviating the worst of children's suffering. Legacy Stephen D. Hassenfeld died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest in 1989 at the age of 47 after quietly and privately battling AIDS since early 1987, and is buried next to his father in Lincoln Park Cemetery in Warwick, Rhode Island. In 1991 he was posthumously inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. At the time of Hassenfeld's death Hasbro was a company with annual net revenues of more than $1.3 billion.

Traditionally, the beginning of the war is dated as September 18, 1810. Depending on what terms are used to define its end, it lasted until 1821, when royalist forces were defeated by José de San Martín; or until 1826, when the last Spanish troops surrendered and the Chiloé Archipelago was incorporated to the Chilean republic. A declaration of independence was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1844, when full diplomatic relations were established. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the more aroused Spanish American wars of independence. Independence did not have unanimous support among Chileans, who were divided between independentists and royalists. What started as a political movement among elites against the colonial power, ended as a full-fledged civil war. Traditionally, the process is divided into three stages: the Patria Vieja, 1810–1814; the Reconquista, 1814–1817; and the Patria Nueva, 1817–1823.  Background  At the start of 1808, the Captaincy General of Chileone of the smallest and poorest colonies in the Spanish Empirewas under the administration of Luis Muñoz de Guzmán, an able, respected and well-liked Royal Governor. In May 1808 the overthrow of Charles IV and Ferdinand VII, their replacement by Joseph Bonaparte and the start of the Peninsular War plunged the empire into a state of agitation. In the meantime, Chile was facing its own internal political problems. Governor Guzmán had suddenly died in February of that year and the crown had not been able to appoint a new governor before the invasion. After a brief interim regency by Juan Rodríguez Ballesteros, and according to the succession law in place at the time, the position was laid claim to and assumed by the most senior military commander, who happened to be Brigadier Francisco García Carrasco. García Carrasco took over the post of Governor of Chile in April and in August the news of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and of the conformation of a Supreme Central Junta to govern the Empire in the absence of a legitimate king reached the country. In the meantime, Charlotte Joaquina, sister of Ferdinand and wife of the King of Portugal, who was living in Brazil, also made attempts to obtain the administration of the Spanish dominions in Latin America. Since her father and brother were being held prisoners in France, she regarded herself as the heiress of her captured family. Allegedly among her plan was to send armies to occupy Buenos Aires and northern Argentina and to style herself as Queen of La Plata. Brigadier García Carrasco was a man of crude and authoritarian manners, who managed in a very short time to alienate the criollo elites under his command. Already in Chile, as in most of Latin America, there had been some independence agitation but minimal and concentrated in the very ineffectual Conspiracy of the Tres Antonios back in 1781. The majority of the people were fervent royalists but were divided into two groups: those who favored the status quo and the divine right of Ferdinand VII (known as absolutists) and those who wanted to proclaim Charlotte Joaquina as Queen (known as carlotists). A third group was composed of those who proposed the replacement of the Spanish authorities with a local junta of notable citizens, which would conform a provisional government to rule in the absence of the king and an independent Spain (known as juntistas). Mateo de Toro Zambrano In 1809, Governor García Carrasco himself was implicated in a flagrant case of corruption (the Scorpion scandal) that managed to destroy whatever remnants of moral authority he or his office had left. From that moment on the pressure for his removal began to build. In June 1810 news arrived from Buenos Aires that Napoleon Bonaparte's forces had conquered Andalusia and laid siege to Cádiz, the last redoubt against the French on Spanish soil. Moreover, the Supreme Central Junta, which had governed the Empire for the past two years, had abolished itself in favor of a Regency Council. García Carrasco, who was a supporter of the carlotist group, managed to magnify the political problems by taking arbitrary and harsh measures, such as the arrest and deportation to Lima without due process of well-known and socially prominent citizens under simple suspicions of having been sympathetic to the junta idea. Among those arrested were José Antonio de Rojas, Juan Antonio Ovalle and Bernardo de Vera y Pintado. Inspired by the May Revolution in Argentina, the autonomy movement had also propagated through the criollo elite. They resented the illegal arrests and, together with the news that Cádiz was all that was left of a free Spain, finally solidified in their opposition to the Governor. Brigadier García Carrasco was suspended from office and forced to resign on July 16, 1810, to be in turn replaced by the next most senior soldier, Mateo de Toro Zambrano Count of la Conquista, even though a legitimate Governor, Francisco Javier de Elío, had already been appointed by the Viceroy of Peru. Count Toro Zambrano was, by all standards, a very unorthodox selection. He was a very old man already (82 years old at the time) and moreover a \\"criollo\\" (someone born in the colonies) as opposed to a \\"peninsular\\" (someone born in Spain). Immediately after his appointment in July, the juntistas began to lobby him in order to obtain the formation of a junta. In August the Royal Appeals Court () took a public loyalty oath to the Regency Council in front of a massive audience, which put added pressure on the Governor to define himself. After vacillating for some time over which party to follow, Toro Zambrano finally agreed to hold an open Cabildo (city hall) meeting in Santiago to discuss the issue. The date was set for September 18, 1810 at 11 AM.  Patria Vieja  First Junta First Junta From the very beginning, the juntistas took the political initiative. As soon as the Cabildo was called, they were able to place their members in the committee charged with sending the invitations, thus manipulating the attendance lists to their own advantage. At the September 18 session, they grabbed center stage with shouts of \\"¡Junta queremos! ¡junta queremos!\\" (\\"We want a junta! We want a junta!\\"). Count Toro Zambrano, faced with this very public show of force, acceded to their demands by depositing his ceremonial baton on top of the main table and saying \\"Here is the baton, take it and rule.\\" The Government Junta of the Kingdom of Chile, also known as the First Junta, was organized with the same powers as a Royal Governor. Their first measure was to take a loyalty oath to Ferdinand VII as legitimate King. Count Toro Zambrano was elected President, and the rest of the positions were distributed equally among all parties, but the real power was left in the hands of the secretary, Juan Martínez de Rozas. The Junta then proceeded to take some concrete measures that had been long-held aspirations of the colonials: it created a militia for the defense of the kingdom, decreed freedom of trade with all nations that were allied to Spain or neutrals, a unique tariff of 134% for all imports (with the exception of printing presses, books and guns which were liberated from all taxes) and in order to increase its representativity, ordered the convocatory of a National Congress. Immediately, political intrigue began amongst the ruling elite, with news of the political turbulence and wars of Europe all the while coming in. It was eventually decided that elections for the National Congress, to be composed of 42 representatives, would be held in 1811. Juan Martínez de Rozas Three political tendencies were starting to appear: the Extremists (), the Moderates () and the Royalists (). These groups were all decidedly against independence from Spain and differentiated themselves only in the degree of political autonomy that they sought. The Moderates, under the leadership of José Miguel Infante, were a majority, and wanted a very slow pace of reforms since they were afraid that once the King was back in power he would think that they were seeking independence and would roll-back all changes. The Extremists were the second most important group and they advocated a larger degree of freedom from the Crown and a faster pace of reforms stopping just short of full independence. Their leader was Juan Martínez de Rozas. The Royalists were against any reform at all and for the maintenance of the status quo. By March 1811, 36 representatives had already been elected in all major cities with the exception of Santiago and Valparaíso. The great political surprise up to that point had been the results from the other center of power, Concepción, in which Royalists had defeated the supporters of Juan Martínez de Rozas. In the rest of Chile, the results were more or less equally divided: twelve pro-Rozas delegates, fourteen anti- Rozas and three Royalists. So, the Santiago elections were the key to Rozas' desire to remain in power. This election was supposed to take place on April 10, but before they could be called the Figueroa mutiny broke out. On April 1, Royalist colonel Tomás de Figueroa—considering the notion of elections to be too populist—led a revolt in Santiago. The revolt sputtered, and Figueroa was arrested and summarily executed. The mutiny was successful in that temporarily sabotaged the elections, which had to be delayed. Eventually, however, a National Congress was duly elected, and all 6 deputies from Santiago came from the Moderate camp. Nonetheless, the mutiny also encouraged a radicalization of political postures. Although Moderates—who continued advocating political control of the elites and greater autonomy without a complete rupture from Spain—gained the majority of seats, a vocal minority was formed by Extremist revolutionaries who now wanted complete and instant independence from Spain. The Real Audiencia of Chile, a long-standing pillar of Spanish rule, was dissolved for its alleged \\"complicity\\" with the mutiny. The idea of full independence gained momentum for the first time. Carrera dictatorship José Miguel Carrera During this time, a well-connected young man and a veteran of the Peninsular War, José Miguel Carrera, returned to Chile from Spain. Quickly, he was involved with the intrigues of various Extremists who plotted to wrest power from Martínez de Rozas through armed means. After two coups, both in the end of 1811, the ambitious Carrera managed to take power, inaugurating a dictatorship. Prominent members of the government were Carrera's brothers Juan José and Luis, as well as Bernardo O'Higgins. Meanwhile, a provisional Constitution of 1812 was promulgated with a marked liberal character. An example of this is the stipulation that \\"no order that emanates from outside the territory of Chile will have any effect, and anyone who tries to enforce such an order will be treated as a traitor.\\" Carrera also created patriotic emblems for the Patria Vieja such as the flag, shield, and insignia. Also during his government, the first Chilean newspaper, the La Aurora de Chile was published under the editorship of Friar Camilo Henríquez. It supported the independence movement. Additionally, Carrera was responsible for bringing the first American consul to Chile. This was important, as it established a direct link between the liberalism and federalism of the United States with the principles of the Chilean independence movement. Finally, he founded the Instituto Nacional de Chile and the National Library of Chile. Both of these prestigious institutions have survived to the present day. Spanish invasions Bernardo O'Higgins The triumph of rebellions—both in Chile and Argentina—disquieted the Viceroy of Peru, José Fernando de Abascal. As a result, in 1813, he sent a military expedition by sea under the command of Antonio Pareja to deal with the situation in Chile, and sent another force by land to attack northern Argentina. The troops landed in Concepción, where they were received with applause. Pareja then attempted to take Santiago. This effort failed, as did a subsequent inconclusive assault led by Gabino Gaínza. However, this was not due to the military performance of Carrera, whose incompetence led to the rise of the moderate O'Higgins, who eventually took supreme control of the pro-independence forces. Harassed on all sides, Carrera resigned, in what is commonly taken to mark the beginning of the period of the Reconquista. After the attempt by Gaínza, the two sides had signed the Treaty of Lircay on May 14, nominally bringing peace but effectively only providing a breathing space. Abascal had no intention of honoring the treaty, and that very year sent a much more decisive force southwards, under the command of Mariano Osorio. The royalist force landed and moved to Chillán, demanding complete surrender. O'Higgins wanted to defend the city of Rancagua, while Carrera wanted to make the stand at the pass of Angostura, a more felicitous defensive position but also closer to Santiago. Because of the disagreements and resulting lack of coordination, the independence forces were divided, and O'Higgins was obliged to meet the royalists at Rancagua without reinforcements. The resulting battle, the Disaster of Rancagua, on October 1 and 2 of 1814, was fought fiercely, but ended in stunning defeat for the independence forces of which only 500 of the original 5,000 survived. A little while later, Osorio entered Santiago and put the rebellion of the Patria Vieja to an end.  Reconquista  Francisco Casimiro Marcó del Pont The viceroy Abascal confirmed Mariano Osorio as governor of Chile, although a later disagreement between the two would result in Osorio's removal and the installation of Francisco Casimiro Marcó del Pont as governor in 1815. In any case, the Spanish believed that it was necessary to teach the revolutionaries a good lesson and embarked on a campaign of fierce political persecution, led by the infamous Vicente San Bruno. The patriots found in Santiago—among whom were members of the First Junta—were exiled to the Juan Fernández Islands. Far from pacifying the patriots, these actions served to incite them, and soon even the most moderate concluded that anything short of independence was intolerable. A large group of patriots (among them Carrera and O'Higgins) decided to flee to Mendoza, an Andean province of the newly independent Argentina. At the time, the governor of this province was José de San Martín, a leader of the Argentine independence movement who would become regarded as the \\"Simón Bolívar\\" of the southern part of Spanish South America. Upon the arrival of the exiles, San Martín immediately began to favor O'Higgins (probably because of their shared membership in the Logia Lautaro, a pro- independence secret society).Carrera's influence begun to fade and ended finally when he was executed by firing squad in 1821. Manuel Rodríguez While San Martín and O'Higgins organized an army to recross the Andes and recapture Santiago, they charged the lawyer Manuel Rodríguez with the task of mounting a guerrilla campaign. The goals of the campaign were to keep the Spanish forces off balance, ridicule San Bruno, and generally bolster the morale of the patriots. Through his subsequent daring exploits, Rodríguez became a romantic hero of the revolution. In one of his more celebrated actions, he disguised himself as a beggar and succeeded in obtaining alms from Governor Marcó del Pont himself, who by that time had put a price on Rodríguez's head. The liberating Army of the Andes was prepared by 1817. After a difficult crossing the Andes, royalist forces led by Rafael Maroto were encountered on the plain of Chacabuco, to the north of Santiago. The resulting Battle of Chacabuco, on February 12, 1817, was a decisive victory for the independence forces. As a result, the patriots re-entered Santiago. San Martín was proclaimed Supreme Director, but he declined the offer and put O'Higgins in the post, where he would remain until 1823. On the first anniversary of the Battle of Chacabuco, O'Higgins formally declared independence.  Patria Nueva  José de San Martín, 'libertador' of Chile During the preceding time, Joaquín de la Pezuela was installed as a new viceroy in Peru. He resolved to recall his son- in-law, Mariano Osorio, sending him south with another expeditionary force. The troops disembarked at Concepcion, and recruited a number of Amerindians to join their ranks. Meanwhile, Bernardo O'Higgins moved north to somehow stop the advance of the royalists. However, his forces were surprised and very badly beaten at the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada on March 18, 1818. In the confusion, a false rumor spread that San Martin and O'Higgins had died, and a panic seized the patriot troops, many of whom agitated for a full retreat back across the Andes to Mendoza. In these critical circumstances, the erstwhile Manuel Rodríguez jumped to the lead, haranguing and rallying the soldiers with the cry \\"There's still a country, citizens!\\" He named himself Supreme Director, a position which he would occupy for exactly 30 hours, which was the time the living, but wounded, O'Higgins took to return to Santiago and reclaim command. Then, on April 5, 1818, San Martín inflicted a decisive defeat on Osorio the Battle of Maipú, after which the depleted royalists retreated to Concepcion, never again to launch a major offensive against Santiago. Independence was all but secured, and worries about internal divisions were allayed when O'Higgins saluted San Martín as savior of the country, a moment which came to be known as the Embrace of Maipú. Total war To further secure Chilean independence, San Martín launched a series of actions against armed bands in the mountains, consisting of assorted outlaws, royalists, and Indians who had taken advantage of the chaos of military expeditions and forced recruitments to pillage and sack the countryside. This time of irregular warfare was later called the Guerra a muerte (Total war) for its merciless tactics, as neither the guerillas nor the government soldiers took prisoners. Only after the band of Vicente Benavides was liquidated in 1822 was the region around Concepcion finally pacified. Incorporation of Valdivia and Chiloé Resignation of O'Higgins As San Martín worked to establish internal stability, O'Higgins also looked to defend the country against further external threats by the Spanish and continue to roll back imperial control. He developed the Chilean navy as a line of defense against seaborne attacks, placing the Scotsman Lord Cochrane in the post of admiral. In 1820, Cochrane administered a stunning blow to the remaining royalist forces in a successful attack on a complex of fortifications at Valdivia. Later Cochrane disembarked troops under commander William Miller at northern Chiloé Island in order to conquer the last Spanish stronghold in Chile, the Archipelago of Chiloé. This failed attempt ended in the minor but significant Battle of Agüi. Later on, Georges Beauchef headed from Valdivia an expedition to secure Osorno so that the Spanish would not reoccupy Valdivia from the land. Beauchef inflicted a decisive defeat on the royalists at the Battle of El Toro. In any case, San Martín and O'Higgins were in agreement that the danger would not be passed until the Viceroyalty of Peru itself was independent from Spain. Thus, a fleet and army was prepared for an expedition to the country, and in 1820, San Martín and Cochrane set off for Peru. However, the audacious and daring character of Cochrane conflicted with the excessive prudence of San Martín. San Martín let escape a number of opportunities to land the decisive blow against the viceroy, and in the end it was Simón Bolívar who launched the final offensive after coming down from Colombia, Peruvian independence was secured after the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824, in which forces led by Antonio José de Sucre—a lieutenant of Bolívar—defeated the royalist army for good. In Chilean historiography, the Patria Nueva generally ends in 1823, with the resignation of O'Higgins. However, the last Spanish territory in Chile, the archipelago of Chiloé, was not conquered until 1826, during the government of Ramón Freire, O'Higgins' successor. However some believe that the \\"Patria Nueva\\" is a never-ending movement and that it continues to prevail in Chilean nationalistic ideas today.  Economic impact  The independence wars in Chile (1810–1818) and Peru (1809–1824) had a negative impact on the Chilean wheat industry. Trade was disrupted and armies in Chile pillaged the countryside. The Guerra a muerte phase was particularly destructive and ended only to see a period of outlaw banditry (e.g. Pincheira brothers) occur until the late 1820s. Trade with Peru did not fully recover after the independence struggles. Villalobos, Sergio; Silva, Osvaldo; Silva, Fernando and Estelle, Patricio. 1974. Historia De Chile. Editorial Universitaria, Chile. p 406-413. Being isolated from Central Chile by hostile Mapuche-controlled territory and dependent upon seaborne trade with the port of Callao in Peru the city of Valdivia was particularly badly hit by the decline of the trade with Peru. The fortune of this city would not shift until the arrival of German settlers in the late 1840s. The Chilean ruling elite adopted a free trade policy already in 1811 with the \\"Decreto de Libre Comercio\\". Historia contemporánea de Chile III.

The flexibility of the MEU was demonstrated with the Iraq crisis in late 1998 regarding the regime not complying with the U.N. weapons inspections process. All four ARG ships had just completed Exercise Foal Eagle off the coast of Korea, and were heading to various port visits for liberty, when each ship received the call in early Nov 1998 to sail immediately to Okinawa to onload the 31st MEU. A significant portion of the 31st MEU’s 2000 Marines were engaged in urban warfare training in Guam when their message to return to Okinawa came in November. The rest were still in Okinawa, but approximately a quarter of those were a new infantry battalion, just rotating in from California. The battalion had just two days to gather all their personnel to get ready to deploy. The 31st MEU and ships’ company personnel started their initial onloads to the ships on 9 Nov and completed the morning of 11 Nov. In one night alone, they loaded more than 170 pallets of equipment, weapons, and cargo. In addition, a C-5 Galaxy from Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, originally scheduled to bring maintenance supplies and tools to Okinawa two weeks later, arrived early on 10 Nov 1998 in order to restock the MEU’s Air Combat Element. This evolution was a part of the normal supply rotation, but the shipment arrived a week early – just in time to load onto the ships before they departed. From Nov 1998 to Feb 1999, the MEU participated in operations in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Kuwait, including Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Fox. In December 1998 2/4 participated as the Battalion Landing Team (BLT) for the 31 Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operations Capable (MEUSOC). The operation, named \\"Desert Fox\\", was a retaliation to Saddam Hussein's refusal to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolutions that led to a coalition air bombing campaign. The Marines of 2/4 were also set up in a defense at and around Muttla ridge, in Kuwait, to act as a deterrent for any Iraqi attack on Kuwait that might have followed the air campaign.

In August 2004, the battalion again deployed in support of OIF and operated as a provisional military police with the 1st Marine Division in Ramadi, Iraq. They returned to Camp Pendleton in March 2005. From then to September 2007, individual batteries continued to deploy as both traditional artillery and provisional military police throughout Al Anbar. From February 2008 through February 2009 the battalion deployed as civil affairs unit to areas of Fallujah, Ramadi and far western Al Anbar Province.

Story Noriko, an ordinary schoolgirl, has slipped into a mysterious world of magic and flying dragons, which is in chaos due to the ancient foresaying of The Awakening. Every kingdom in the world is in search for the Awakening as they believe that it has the power to control the Sky Demon, the most destructive monster. Noriko meets Izark, the lonesome warrior, and accompanies him. Izark was born with a mysterious power that makes people hate him and causes him to travel alone. He came here in order to change his fate by trying to kill the Awakening only to find out that the Awakening is Noriko. As she travels with him, it's hard for them to talk as they speak different languages. Izark realizes that Noriko knows nothing at all about her being the Awakening and can't leave her alone in the middle of nowhere. He decides to take her to his old and only friend Gaya. During the journey to Gaya's place, he is struck by a mysterious illness: the sign of his physical transformation to the Sky Demon, as he turns out to be the Sky Demon in human form. Noriko has no clue about his illness as well as his frustration with her, but tries her best to nurse him. Rachef, the young ruler of Rienca, sends his best warrior Keimos to search for the Awakening. Finally Keimos catches up with them, and he and Izark start to duel in which Izark won.

Noriko also realizes her feelings for Izark and a battle between Light and Dark commences as Rachef, Leader of Rienka, tries to take over. Characters Protagonists ; :A wandering swordsman who helps people in need (with payment, of course). He is the reincarnation of the greatest evil, the Sky Demon. He is much stronger than the average person. He can jump higher, run faster, and also summon fire and wind. Ever since he was small, Izark was shunned by his mother, who called him a monster and rejected having given birth to him, which in turn results in his insecurity about being the Sky Demon and does not easily trust others. Noriko was the first person to really open up to him, as she did not know of his being. He quickly comes to care for Noriko, and the feeling soon turns into undeniable love, but because he believes himself to be an abomination, he hides his feelings because he thinks he can only hurt Noriko. ; :High school student. She is an ordinary, slightly unconfident girl, who was transported to a strange world by a bomb explosion. Izark was the first person she met and taught her to speak his language. Noriko did not know that she was The Awakening, who was wanted by many countries. Many neighboring countries believed that by capturing The Awakening, they could also control the Sky Demon. Noriko falls in love with Izark quite early into the story. ; :Izark's friend. In the past, she was a soldier of the Gray Bird tribe, which was forced to disband.

Sikhism  In Sikhism, this is one of five virtues that is vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are Truth (Sat), Contentment (Santosh), Compassion (Daya) and Humility (Nimrata). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the Gurbani so that these virtues become a part of their mind set. This is a very positive and powerful tool in the Sikhs' arsenal of virtues. When one's mind is full of love, the person will overlook deficiency in others and accept them wholeheartedly as a product of God. Sikhism asks all believers to take on \\"god-like\\" virtues and this perhaps is the most \\"god-like\\" characteristic of all. Gurbani tells us that Waheguru is a \\"loving God\\", full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive; to never hate anyone; to live in His Hukam (\\"Will\\") and to practise compassion and humility. \\"My mind is imbued with the Lord's Love; it is dyed a deep crimson.

The FM translator is permitted to operate 24 hours a day. History WFCN first signed on the air in December 1968 as 1190 WAMB.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 pg. C-197 It was the brainchild of longtime Nashville broadcaster Bill Barry, who realized in the 1960s that the switch of most popular radio stations to varied youth-oriented formats was alienating many older listeners, a large segment of whom were nostalgic for the big band sound of 1930s and 1940s popular music and a station which would play it. The station was originally licensed to the Nashville suburb of Donelson. Airing a format called \\"The Music of Your Life\\", it was a pioneer of Adult standards music. The format was eventually syndicated with hundreds of such stations carrying the Music of Your Life throughout North America. From a small start, Barry began to attract advertisers whose products appealed largely to older listeners - Cadillac automobiles, retirement homes, prepaid funeral plans, and medical services (once the FCC started allowing those providers to advertise). Barry eventually was able to raise the station's daytime power to the maximum 50,000 watts although the station could not broadcast at night. Barry's station and its programming attracted a small (by mass-market radio standards) but loyal listening audience. Barry served his listeners with hourly news, which began disappearing from many music-format stations once the FCC stopped requiring radio broadcasters to deliver at least five minutes of it each broadcast hour. Barry nonetheless knew that news was very important to much of his mature audience, as well as investment news (market research revealing that his audience had a far larger-than-average net worth). The primary threat to Barry and WAMB remained the passage of time. Each year a certain percentage of his targeted audience died and for the most part was not replaced by younger listeners. In recognition of this fact, some newer music from the \\"easy- listening\\" category of artists such as The Carpenters, Roger Whittaker, and Harry Connick, Jr. were admitted to the playlist, but the station's demographics continued to skew far older than any other major Nashville station. In recognition of this fact, and the fact that fewer AM stations anywhere were programming music of any sort than previously, Barry sold the 1160 kHz frequency in late 2005 to religious radio broadcaster Bott Communications. Bott took over the frequency in early 2006 and changed the format to a Christian one, with a standard emphasis on evangelical/fundamentalist preaching and conservative talk shows. To reflect the new identity, Bott had the call sign of 1160 kHz changed to WCRT. Barry decided to move the big band format and the WAMB callsign to a new frequency (with power greatly reduced), 1200 kHz. Later Barry acquired another FM frequency, 99.3, for simulcasting purposes, especially at night; this continued until shortly after his death. Roundtable WAMB was the last Nashville radio station to carry Teddy Bart's Roundtable morning discussion program. Bart and co-host Karlen Evins interviewed newsmakers involved in Tennessee politics on the two-hour show, which began originally on WLAC in 1985 and had been heard on several other stations in the 1990s. The non-profit organization founded by Bart and Evins to produce the program discontinued production in the summer of 2005, due to increasing debts and declining listenership. Elsewhere in the state, cable television systems and Martin's (West Tennessee) WLJT, a PBS affiliate, carried a video version of Roundtable, with a camera positioned inside the radio control room. Later, Bart and Evins offered a regular podcast titled \\"Beyond Reason,\\" an exploration of religious and metaphysical interpretation of current events; both hosts long maintained interests in the paranormal. This continued until shortly before Bart's death. Format change: January 2014 Station owner Bill Barry died in September 2013 at the age of 88. In the wake of his death, his family entered into an LMA with Silva Entertainment which in January 2014 changed the station's format to Spanish-language pop music. This format, though, ended abruptly in September 2014, and was replaced by a simulcast of WANT, which airs Westwood One's Real Country format. Ownership change: June 2016 Effective June 8, 2016, WAMB was bought by Moody Radio to simulcast the Christian radio programming heard on nearby station WFCM-FM in Murfreesboro. The station changed its call sign to WFCN on June 9, 2016. WFCN was taken silent in order to make repairs on the transmitter.http://www.insideradio.com/free/moody- radio-gets-calling-for-nashville- expansion/article_fbb6962c-32ca-11e6-b22c-efda1b2bc9ea.html See also *List of Nashville media References External links FCN Category:Radio stations established in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in Tennessee FCN ","title":"WFCN"},{"id":"4489461","text":"is a Japanese biologist who proposed an explanation for reduced diffusion speed of lipid and protein molecules in the cell membrane, based on a model of hop diffusion in which lipids are confined to a reduced space, created by a membrane-skeleton-induced compartments. this compartments allow the lipids or proteins freely in a limited region and limiting also the diffusion to other parts of the membrane.

Pugh currently serves as an Adjunct Professor of International Law at the University of Cape Town. Early life and family Pugh was born in Plymouth, England. His father, Surgeon Rear Admiral P.D. Gordon Pugh, OBE, FRCS was a surgeon in the Royal Navy, an author, and a prolific collector of ceramics of the Victorian era. His mother, Margery Pugh was a Senior Nursing Sister in Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service. Education Pugh grew up on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon. He was educated at Mount Kelly School in Tavistock. When he was 10 years old his family emigrated to South Africa. He continued his schooling at St Andrew's College in Grahamstown and later at Camps Bay High School in Cape Town. He went on to read politics and law at the University of Cape Town and graduated at the top of his Masters class. In his mid-twenties he returned to England where he read International Law at Jesus College, Cambridge and then worked as a maritime lawyer in the City of London for a number of years. During this time he concurrently served as a Reservist in the British Special Air Service. Swimming Over a period of 30 years Pugh has pioneered more swims around famous landmarks than any other swimmer in history. In an interview with Forbes he stated: > \\"Between Lynne Cox, Martin Strel and myself, we've hit all of the world's > major landmarks. There's really nothing left.\\" In 2013 he was inducted into the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame. Early swims Pugh had his first real swimming lesson in 1986, at the age of 17. One month later he swam from Robben Island (where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned) to Cape Town. In 1992 he swam across the English Channel. In 2002 he broke the record for the fastest time for swimming around Robben Island. He was the first person to swim around Cape Agulhas (the southernmost point in Africa), the Cape of Good Hope, and the Cape Peninsula (a swim from Cape Town to Muizenberg). Pugh was also the first person to swim across an African Great Lake, namely Lake Malawi. Cold water swims Pugh training in Antarctica in 2005 After 2003 Pugh focused on pioneering swims in the coldest and most hostile waters of the world. All of them were undertaken in accordance with Channel Swimming Association rules, in just a pair of Speedo swimming trunks, cap and goggles. He became the first person to swim around the infamous North Cape, the northernmost point in Europe. The following year he became the first person to swim down the entire length of Sognefjord in Norway, a swim which took him 21 days to complete. In 2005 he broke the world record for the farthest-north long-distance swim by undertaking a swim at 80° North around Verlegenhuken, the northernmost cape in Spitsbergen. He followed that five months later by breaking Lynne Cox's world record for the farthest-south long- distance swim by undertaking a swim at 65° South at Petermann Island off the Antarctic Peninsula. In November 2017, Pugh became be the first person to swim in the Antarctic waters around South Georgia Island. Anticipatory Thermo- Genesis On both his Arctic and Antarctic expeditions Professor Tim Noakes, a sports scientist from the University of Cape Town, recorded Pugh's ability to raise his core body temperature by nearly 2 °C in anticipation of entering the freezing water. He coined the phrase \\"anticipatory thermo-genesis\\" (the creation of heat before an event). This phenomenon had not been noted in any other human. Noakes argues it is a Pavlovian Response to years of cold water swimming, while Pugh believes it is a response to fear. World Winter Swimming Championships In 2006 Pugh challenged Russia's top cold water swimmers to a 500-metre race at the World Winter Swimming Championships in Finland. He easily won the gold medal, beating Russian Champion Alexander Brylin by over 100 metres and the bronze medalist Nefatov Vladimir by 125 metres. \\"Holy Grail\\" of swimming In 2006 Pugh achieved the \\"Holy Grail\\" of swimming by becoming the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. His five swims were : * Atlantic Ocean – across the English Channel in 1992 * Arctic Ocean – around the most northern point of the Island of Spitsbergen in 2005 * Southern Ocean – across Whaler's Bay in Deception Island in 2005 * Indian Ocean – across Nelson Mandela Bay in 2006 * Pacific Ocean – from Manly Beach through the Sydney Heads to the Sydney Opera House in 2006 Environmental swims River Thames In 2006, he became the first person to swim the entire length of the River Thames. He undertook the swim to draw attention to the severe drought in England and the dangers of global warming. The swim took him 21 days to complete. The upper stretch of the river had stopped flowing due to the drought, forcing Pugh to run the first of the river. While swimming through London, Pugh exited the water and made a visit to Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street to call on the United Kingdom to move towards a low carbon economy. Shortly afterwards the Prime Minister introduced the Climate Change Bill to Parliament. Maldives In February 2007 Pugh became the first person to swim across the width of the Maldives. He undertook the swim to raise awareness about the effect of climate change on low-lying islands in the world. The swim took 10 days to complete. North Pole In July 2007 Pugh undertook the first long-distance swim across the Geographic North Pole. The swim, across an open patch of sea, in minus 1.7 °C (29 °F) water, took 18 minutes and 50 seconds to complete. Jørgen Amundsen, the great-grandnephew of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, paced Pugh by skiing alongside him during the swim. The swim coincided with the lowest coverage of Arctic sea ice ever recorded. After his swim Pugh explained his decision to swim in just a Speedo costume: > \\"I urge world leaders to do everything they can to protect our environment. > But sometimes the legislation I request they enact is unpopular with the > electorate. If I am asking them to be courageous, I must also be. Swimming > in a wetsuit or a dry-suit would not send the right message.\\" Mount Everest Pugh completing a 1km swim across a glacial lake on Mount Everest In May 2010 Pugh swam across Lake Pumori, a glacial lake on Mount Everest, to highlight the melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas and the impact the reduced water supply will have on world peace. Millions of people from India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal rely on the water, which flows from the Himalayan glaciers. The swim, at an altitude of 5,300 metres, in 2 °C water (35 °F), took 22 minutes and 51 seconds to complete. The Seven Seas In August 2014 Pugh undertook the first long-distance swim in all the Seven Seas to campaign for more Marine Protected Areas in the region. The swims took place in the following locations: * Mediterranean Sea – a 10 km swim off Monte Carlo in Monaco * Adriatic Sea – a 10 km swim off Zadar in Croatia * Aegean Sea – a 10 km swim off Athens in Greece * Black Sea – a 10 km swim off Şile in Turkey * Red Sea – a 10 km swim off Aqaba in Jordan * Arabian Sea – a 10 km swim off Rass Al Hadd in Oman * North Sea – a 60 km Thames swim from Southend-on-Sea to the Thames Barrier, east London. Afterwards Pugh wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that: > \\"The swims were intended to draw attention to the health of the oceans. But > I seriously underestimated the urgency of the issue I was swimming for. As > the United Nation's Patron of the Oceans, I have given many speeches > stressing the need to protect our environment for the sake of our children > and grandchildren. I now I realize it’s not about our children. It’s about > us. The situation is much worse than I thought. I was shocked by what I saw > in the seas, and by what I didn’t see. I saw no sharks, no whales, no > dolphins. I saw no fish longer than 30 centimeters (11 inches). The larger > ones had all been fished out.\\" English Channel In July and August 2018, Pugh swam the entire length of the English Channel – the first person ever to do so. He left Land's End in Cornwall on 12 July and arrived in Dover on 29 August, after 49 days at sea. He swam between 10 and 20 kilometres each day in order to cover the distance. Pugh swam the 528 kilometres (328 miles) to call for 30% of oceans to be protected by 2030. He was greeted on landing at Shakespeare Beach by UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who described him as a \\"modern day hero\\" and a \\"brilliant champion for marine conservation zones.' Kayaking Pugh attempting to kayak to the North Pole in 2008 In September 2008, Pugh, accompanied by a team aboard a ship where he slept, attempted to kayak the 1,200 km from Svalbard, across the Arctic Ocean, to the North Pole, but the team abandoned the effort 135 km from the start. The aim was to further highlight the melting sea ice. The expedition coincided with some scientists predicting that the North Pole could be free of sea-ice in the summer of 2008, for the first time in thousands of years. Pugh stated that despite several attempts, they were unable to find a gap in the ice. In his autobiography Pugh wrote: > \\"Ironically, global warming played no small part in undermining the entire > expedition. We believed that the greater melting of summer ice would open up > large areas of sea and allow us to paddle north at good speed. What we did > not fully appreciate was that to the north of us there was a widespread > melting of sea ice off the coast of Alaska and the New Siberian Islands and > the ice was being pushed south towards us ... The evidence of climate change > was stark. Fourteen months before I'd sailed north and I'd seen a > preponderance of multi-year ice about three metres thick north of > Spitsbergen, but this time most of the ice was just a metre thick.\\" Public speaking Pugh has twice spoken at the TED Global Conference and is described on their website as a \\"master story-teller\\". The Financial Times reported that his speech at TEDGlobal in 2010: > \\"... was the perfect TED talk: a little bit of action, some thinking outside > the box, humbling words on the need to respect nature, a happy ending. A > Hollywood scriptwriter could not have structured it better.\\" And his speech on environmental leadership at the 2008 Business Innovation Forum Conference in the USA was voted as one of the \\"7 Most Inspiring Videos on the Web\\" by Mashable, the social media guide. Pugh has addressed the World Economic Forum at their annual meeting in Davos. He also gave the keynote addresses at Coca-Cola's 125th anniversary in 2011, Lloyd's Agency Network's 200th anniversary in 2011, and Swiss Re's 150th anniversary in 2013. Environmental campaigning Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Pugh During his youth Pugh visited many National Parks in South Africa, following his father's desire to teach him to love and respect nature after what he had witnessed whilst serving in the Royal Navy. His father was present at the first British atomic bomb test in 1952 and a number of subsequent tests. In 2003 Pugh left his maritime law practice to campaign full-time for the protection of the oceans. He often addresses Heads of State and business leaders on the topics of climate change, overfishing and pollution and the need for Marine Protected Areas and low carbon economies. In 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Pugh took the evidence of witnesses from across Africa on the effects of climate change at the Pan-African Climate and Poverty Hearings. The evidence was presented to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Polar Defense Project In 2008 Pugh founded the Polar Defense Project to campaign for greater protection for the Arctic and a resolution of the maritime boundary disputes. In 2009 it won the Best Project for the Environment at the inaugural Beyond Sport Awards. BP oil disaster Pugh was outspoken on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In a feature in Business Day he said: > \\"They [BP top executives] should be criminally prosecuted. They should go to > jail. What I can't understand is why people haven't responded more > vigorously, by boycotting BP.\\" Fracking for gas in the Karoo Pugh also opposes fracking for gas in the Karoo region of South Africa. In a public speech to Royal Dutch Shell in 2011 entitled \\"Standing up to Goliath\\" he said: > \\"Never, ever did I think there would be a debate in this arid country about > which was more important – gas or water. We can survive without gas. We can > not live without water ... Now is the time for change. We cannot drill our > way out of the energy crisis. The era of fossil fuels is over. We must > invest in renewable energy. And we must not delay.\\" In 2015 Royal Dutch Shell decided to pull out of their proposed fracking projects in South Africa citing lower energy prices and delays in obtaining an exploration licence. Plastic Pollution In 2018 Pugh was listed as the 3rd most influential person in the world discussing how to tackle plastic pollution on social media. Media Pugh has appeared on numerous TV shows including Good Morning America, Jay Leno, Richard & Judy, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and BBC Breakfast. He has also been featured by Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Vital Signs on CNN, ADN on France 2, Carte Blanche and Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. In 2009 Pugh starred in Robson Green's Wild Swimming Adventure where he trained the English actor to swim across the icy waters of Llyn Llydaw, a lake on Snowdon in Wales. Afterwards Robson Green said: > \\"... Lewis prepared me psychologically for something that was way outside my > comfort zone. His introduction to the notion of committing to an objective, > becoming unstoppable and reaching that objective was life changing. There > was no swim I couldn't do after meeting Lewis because anything is possible > if you COMMIT!!\\" In 2013 he appeared on the front of The Big Issue holding a northern rockhopper penguin in an issue dedicated to ocean issues. Books In 2010 Pugh's autobiography \\"Achieving the Impossible\\" was published by Simon & Schuster. It quickly became a No. 1 best-seller. In 2013 Pugh wrote a second book entitled \\"21 Yaks and a Speedo\\". The title is a reference to his swim on Mt Everest. The book is a collection of 21 short stories about his expeditions and the lessons he has learnt from them. It was published by Jonathan Ball Publishers. The Financial Times described the book as \\"compelling\\" and Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu said \\"The book made me want to stand a little taller.\\" Awards Achim Steiner appointing Pugh as UN Patron of the Oceans * 2019 - The Mungo Park Medal from the Royal Scottish Geographical Society * 2018 - Inducted into the Ice Swimming Hall of Fame * 2017 - SAB Environmentalist of the Year * 2017 - The Sunday Times Alternative Rich List for \\"people who represent the most inspiring side of humanity\\" * 2017 – Appointed as an Adjunct Professor of International Law at the University of Cape Town * 2015 – Doctor of Science (honoris causa) from Plymouth University * 2015 – Selected by Men's Journal as one of \\"50 Most Adventurous Men in the World\\" * 2015 – National Geographic Adventurer of the Year * 2013 – Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts * 2013 – Appointed as the United Nations Patron of the Oceans * 2013 – Inducted into the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame * 2013 – Honorary Fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society * 2011 – Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, London * 2011 – President's Award from the International Swimming Hall of Fame * 2010 – Appointed a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum * 2009 – Awarded the highest honour in South Africa – the Order of Ikhamanga (Gold Class) for his \\"exceptional sporting triumphs, humanitarian feats and creating consciousness about the negative effects of global warming\\".
