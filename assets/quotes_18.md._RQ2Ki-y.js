Bera () (died 844) was the first count of Barcelona from 801 until his deposition in 820. He was also the count of Raz√®s and Conflent from 790, and the count of Girona and Besal√∫ from 812 (or 813 or 817) until his deposition. In 811, he was witness to the last will and testament of Charlemagne. Origins Bera's origins are mostly unknown, although it seems certain that he was a Visigoth.Ramon d'Abadal, Els primers comtes catalans, 1958, republished by La Magrana, Barcelona, 2011, p. 259. He may have been one of the sons of William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse and cousin of Charlemagne, although this is not supported by William's detailed will from 804. In 790, Bera was given the governorship of the counties of Raz√®s and Conflent, possibly by William. The Counties of Roussillon (with the pagus of Vallespir) and Emp√∫ries were given to William's son Gaucelm, whose mother was Gunegunde (Cunegonde), one of William's two wives. Background and installation In 796, Sa'dun al Ruayni, the Wali of Barcelona, attempted to break his allegiance to Al-Hakam I, emir of C√≥rdoba. In April 797, he travelled to Aachen and offered to switch the city's allegiance to Charlemagne in exchange for help against C√≥rdoba. Charlemagne summoned an assembly in Toulouse in the spring of 800 which agreed to send his son Louis the Pious to Barcelona. The army included a number of noble men, among them Rostany of Girona, Adhemar of Narbonne, and William of Toulouse. Sa‚Äôdun, however, had changed his mind and the Frankish forces laid siege of Barcelona. Eventually, starving and with Sa‚Äôdun having been captured by the Franks trying to reach Caliphate of Cordoba in a plea for help, the city's Visigoth population handed the new Wali Harun over to the Franks with their surrender on Saturday, April 3, 801. Louis entered the city on the following day. Soon after, Bera, who was part of the besieging army, was invested as the first Count of Barcelona. Expeditions across the Ebro Bera took part in the Frankish campaigns in 804, 808, and 809 to extend the southern border of the Marca Hispanica to the River Ebro which was felt to be a natural defendable barrier between the two empires. This was despite his Visigoth mother who urged him to keep peace with the Muslims States to the south and west. First expedition In 804, Louis the Pious led an army to Tarragona. At Santa Coloma, the army divided into two. Louis marched his division straight for Tortosa while the other commanded by Bera, Adhemar, and Borrell of Ausona covered Louis' western flank and attacked Tortosa from the south. Bera turned his army around after they had crossed the River Ebro where it meets the Cinca. The army went as far as Vila Rubea before being forced to turn back to Vallis Ibana (this is possibly modern Vallibona), near Morella. They then rejoined the troops commanded by Louis's which has unsuccessfully undertaken a siege of Tortosa. The army then turned north and returned to Barcelona. Second expedition In 808, Charlemagne sent his legate Ingobert to Toulouse to meet Louis and prepare for another expedition south. The plan was to follow the same tactics as in 804. The \\"Astronomer\\", author of the Vita Hludovici, writes that the forces of Bera and Adhemar crossed the Ebro in boats while their horses swam across. However, the horse dung was swept by the current past Tortosa which alerted the town's garrison. The Wali of the city attacked Bera, who was forced to retreat north again. Third expedition In 809, Louis led his last expedition as King of Aquitaine into the Marca. This time equipped with siege engines, Tortosa was besieged for forty days by Frankish and troops from the Marca (under Bera). The new Emir of Cordoba, Abd ar-Rahman II, however met the besiegers with an army. The Moorish chronicler Al Maqqari records a Muslim victory, while Astronomus simply states that the besieged offered Louis's the keys to the city and, satisfied, the King of Aquitaine lifted his siege and left. First truce It is probable that Bera was the strongest promoter of peace with C√≥rdoba. This would allow him to consolidate his power in his new possessions. Advised by his mother, and supported by the city's residents keen for continued peaceful relations with the nearby Muslim states, Bera sought to institute a truce. The Frankish court eventually signed a three-year peace treaty with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 812. Bera's father died on 18 May 812 and the Counties of Raz√®s and Conflent passed to him. Following his father's example, Bera gave governorship of the counties to his son Guillemundus. In 812, Bera also travelled to the Imperial Court in Aachen with several other Counts of the region: Adhemar of Narbonne, Gaucelm of Roussillon, Odilo of Girona, Guiscafred of Carcassonne, Ermengar of Emp√∫ries, Laibulf of Provence, and Erlin of B√©ziers. Several Visigoth (hispani) nobles had accused the Counts of Frankish paternity and of imposing unjust tributes and excises on their lands. The Magnates defence was unsuccessful and Charlemagne decided in favour of the claimants Second truce and downfall Around 813, Count Odilo of Girona and Besal√∫ died and these Counties passed to Bera. In 815, the truce with the Caliphate was broken and the war with the Muslims resumed. The Muslim army under the command of Ubayd Allah Abu Marwan, uncle of the Emir Al-Hakam I, attacked Barcelona. However, the attack was beaten back by a mercenary Visigothic army. This victory increased the prestige of Bera, whose relationships with the local Visigoth nobility improved. In November 816, the Wali of Zaragoza travelled to Aachen and negotiated a new three-year truce, which was finally concluded in February 817. However, despite attempts to secure alliances in Pamplona, the Basques remained allied to the Banu Qasi family based in the valley of the River Ebro. They continued to defy Frankish authority, as did Arag√≥n, where the Count was allied with the Basques. Gaucelm and his brother Bernard both claimed that the truce promoted by Bera was against the Empire's best interests and inhibited attempts to force the Basques and Arag√≥n to recognise themselves as vassals of the Empire. In February 820, a general assembly was held in Aachen at which Bera was in attendance. Gaucelm sent his Visigoth lieutenant Sanila in his place, who accused Bera of infidelity and perfidy. The litigation, as was customary in that era, was settled by a duel in the palace. Bera was defeated by Sanila and deprived of his counties.Archibald Lewis, The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050, Chapter 3. However Emperor Louis I, who did not believe the Count was a traitor, commuted the death penalty carried by the defeat into an exile in Rouen. He remained there until his death in 844. He was succeeded as Count of Barcelona by Rampon.

With a length of 1,170 meters (0.73 mi), the bridge has two -wide road lanes, two -wide footpaths and a single gauge railway line in the middle, straddling the narrow central reservation. * The rail gauge is * The loading gauge might be * The structure gauge (roughly equal to a road lane) might be about History Opened on 8 April 1994, it was the first bridge across the lower Mekong, and the second on the full course of the Mekong. The cost was about A$42 million, funded by the Australian government as development aid for Laos. The bridge was designed and built by Australian companies as a demonstration of their ability to complete major infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia. The concept design of a balanced cantilever bridge was proposed by Bruce Ramsay of VSL with the final design carried out by Maunsell consulting engineers. The official name of the bridge was changed by the addition of \\"First\\" after the Second Thai‚ÄìLao Friendship Bridge further south at Savannakhet opened in January 2007. Road traffic Traffic on the bridge drives on the left, as in Thailand, while traffic in Laos drives on the right. The changeover at the Lao end, just before the border post, is controlled by traffic lights. A shuttle bus service operates across the bridge, between the Lao and Thai border posts. Bicycles and tricycles can travel on either the road or the footpath, while pedestrians can walk directly on the footpath. The bridge is part of AH12 of the Asian Highway Network. Railway A meter gauge rail track from Nong Khai station runs along the midpoint of the bridge. Road traffic is stopped when a train is crossing. On 20 March 2004, an agreement between the Thai and Lao governments was signed to extend the railway to Thanaleng Railway Station in Laos, about 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the bridge. This will be the first railway link to Laos (but not the first railway, as a short portage line once existed). The Thai government agreed to finance the line through a combination of grant and loan. Construction formally began on 19 January 2007. Test trains began running on 4 July 2008. Formal inauguration occurred on 5 March 2009. On 22 February 2006, approval of funding for the rail line from Thanaleng Railway Station to Vientiane, about 9 km, was announced by the French Development Agency.Saeung, Sopaporn (23 February 2006). \\"France okays Thai-Laos railway link\\" , The Nation. In November 2010 plans to extend the service from Thanaleng to Vientiane were abandoned.\\"Laos scraps full rail link to Nong Khai\\", Bangkok Post, 6 November 2010 A hypothetical high-speed rail link from China to Thailand through Laos would make the extension redundant, but would also necessitate the construction of a new bridge near to the current First Friendship Bridge. In 2011, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's revised plan prioritized domestic rail expansion over the ambitious regional connectivity plan spearheaded by China. China is looking to build a high-speed line from Kunming to Singapore, passing through Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia, a project that would increase China's GDP and those of the involved nations by US$375 billion, according to China Railway Corp.

History Sixty State Street marks the site of one of two colonial taverns named the Great Britain Coffee-House, where Queen Street (now Court Street) ended and King Street (now State Street) began. This Great Britain Coffee-House, established in 1713, advertised \\"superfine bohea, and green tea, chocolate, coffee-powder, etc.\\"Drake, Samuel Adams. Old Boston Taverns and Tavern Clubs. Boston: W.A. Butterfield, 1917, p. 63. In 1838, Thatcher Magoun Sr., a ship designer, builder and merchant who ran a shipbuilding facility in Medford, established Thatcher Magoun & Son, a counting-house, on the 60 State Street site to manage his business revenue, bookkeeping and correspondence.https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/495028291/ This helped to establish State Street as one of Boston's financial centers, hence initiate the city's Financial District. His son and grandson, Thatcher Magoun Jr. and Thatcher Magoun III, kept the firm going in the maritime trade until the late 1870s. An abstract from the firm's records reads: :Correspondence and business records including bills of lading, receipts, outfitting accounts, and crew lists, relating to the ships ARCHIMEDES, DEUCALION, ELECTRIC SPARK, GREENWICH, HERALD OF THE MORNING, MANLIUS, MEDFORD, PHARSALIA, SWALLOW, TALMA, THATCHER MAGOUN, TIMOLEON, and WITCHCRAFT, built in Magoun's yard in Medford, Mass., and engaged in trade between Boston, New York, San Francisco and foreign ports including Liverpool, Elsinore, Havana, and Hong Kong; and materials not specifically related to Thatcher Magoun & Son business enterprises: i.e. the records of B.

The granite-clad triangular pillars alternate with vertical banks of rectangular floor-to-ceiling windows in a pattern similar to that of Eero Saarinen's black granite-faced CBS Building, a.k.a. \\"Black Rock,\\" in New York City.Goldberger, Paul. The City Observed: New York: A Guide to the Architecture of Manhattan. New York: Vintage Books, 1979, p. 174-175. Also like Black Rock, 60 State Street is surrounded by a pedestrian plaza. Only this time the plaza is raised rather than sunken and is accessible at street level from State Street and by two flights of stairs from Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Unlike Black Rock's rectangular solid composition, 60 State Street was given eleven sides and a two-part scheme so that it has the appearance of side-by-side octagonal tubes from a distance.Lyndon, Donlyn. The City Observed: Boston: A Guide to the Architecture of the Hub. New York: Vintage Books, 1982, p. 269-270. The chamfered corner pillars are similarly octagonal. This theme recalls Boston's historic architectural vernacular of chamfered bay windows on Beacon Hill and in the Back Bay. Venues and tenants The main office of a major international law firm, WilmerHale, is located at 60 State Street. The building is shared with Good Measures and is the corporate headquarters for the company. The building also served as the corporate headquarters of the Sheraton Hotel group from 1978 until they were acquired by Starwood Hotels and Resorts in 1998. The State Room is located in the building's elegant space on the 33rd floor, the site of the former Bay Tower Room restaurant.

However, 26 years later in late 2014, Rak Records was revived as a label for new artists releasing both downloads and 7-inch vinyl in the form of a singles club. The Cadbury Sisters, Trojanhorse, and Beautiful Boy were the new signings. They recorded their own original songs as the A-sides, and covered a classic Rak artists cover as the B-side. The Cadbury Sisters covered Steve Harley's 1975 classic \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)\\" (even though it was originally released on the generic EMI label), Trojan Horse did Cozy Powell's \\"Dance With The Devil\\", and Beautiful Boy did \\"Kids In America\\".

Move to Argentina During the 8th Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in August/September 1939, World War II broke out. Najdorf was Jewish, as were two of his teammates, Tartakower and Frydman.Eliot Hearst, John Knott, Blindfold Chess: History, Psychology, Techniques, Champions, World Records, and Important Games, McFarland 2009, p. 91. He decided to stay and settle in Argentina (as did many others). He became an Argentinian citizen in 1944.Miguel Najdorf, 87, Famed For Sparkling Chess, Dies, New York Times, July 17, 1997 His wife, daughter, parents and four brothers all were murdered in the Holocaust. Najdorf later remarried (twice) and had two daughters. Blindfold chess Najdorf set world records for simultaneous blindfold chess. He played a record 40 opponents in 1943, and increased the record to 45 in 1947. This record stood until 2011. He set these records in the hope that the news would be reported in Europe and his family would learn of his whereabouts. Career in Argentina 1940s In September 1939, after the Olympiad, Najdorf emerged as one of the top players in the chess world. He tied for first with Paul Keres at Buenos Aires (C√≠rculo de Ajedrez); the two scored 8¬Ω/11. In 1941, he took second, after Gideon St√•hlberg at Mar del Plata, with 12¬Ω/17. Later in 1941, he finished equal first with Stahlberg at Buenos Aires, the two scoring 11/14. In 1942, he won at Mar del Plata, with 13¬Ω/17, ahead of St√•hlberg. In 1943, he was second at Mar del Plata, behind St√•lhberg, scoring 10/13. In 1943, he won at Rosario. In 1944, he won at La Plata, with 13/16, ahead of St√•hlberg. In 1944, he tied for first with Herman Pilnik at Mar del Plata, with each scoring 12/15. In 1945, he won at Buenos Aires (Roberto Grau Memorial), with 10/12, ahead of St√•hlberg and Carlos Guimard. He took second place at Vi√±a del Mar 1945, with 10¬Ω/13, behind Guimard, then won Mar del Plata 1945 with 11/15, ahead of St√•hlberg, and repeated at Mar del Plata 1946 with 16/18, ahead of Guimard and St√•hlberg. He also won at Rio de Janeiro 1946.BrasilBase. BrasilBase (2012-11-01). Retrieved on 2012-11-08. After World War II ended, organized chess resumed in the international arena, particularly in war-stricken Europe. In 1946, Najdorf tied for 4th‚Äì5th with L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥ at Groningen, with 11¬Ω/19; the event was won by Mikhail Botvinnik. He then won at Prague, with (+9‚àí1=3), ahead of Petar Trifunoviƒá, Gosta Stoltz, Svetozar Gligoriƒá, and Jan Foltys. He also won at Barcelona 1946, with 11¬Ω/13, ahead of Daniel Yanofsky.

World Championship contender Although not a full-time chess professional (for many years he worked in the insurance business, selling life insurance),Liliana Najdorf, Najdorf x Najdorf, translated by Taylor Kingston, foreword and annotated games by Jan Timman, Russell Enterprises, Inc., 2016, . Najdorf was one of the world's leading chess players in the 1940s and 1950s. Najdorf's string of successes from 1939 to 1947 had raised him into the ranks of the world's top players. According to Chessmetrics, he was ranked second in the world from mid 1947 to mid 1949.Chessmetrics Summary for 1945‚Äì55, Chessmetrics Based on his results, there was talk of inviting him to the 1948 World Championship tournament, but in the end he was not invited. He had won an ostensible qualifying tournament at Prague by a margin of 1¬Ω points. Najdorf stated in a 1947 interview: Pressure from the Soviet Chess Federation, perhaps pushed by Botvinnik, may have been responsible for keeping Najdorf out. In 1950, FIDE made him one of the inaugural International Grandmasters. In the same year he played at Budapest in the Candidates Tournament to select a challenger for the World Chess Championship 1951, and finished fifth. Three years later, in the 1953 Candidates Tournament, he finished equal sixth. He never succeeded in qualifying for the Candidates again. He did come close in the next cycle, narrowly failing to qualify from the 1955 Interzonal, held at Gothenburg, Sweden.1955 Goteborg Interzonal Tournament, Mark Weeks' Chess Pages Later career Najdorf won important tournaments such as Mar del Plata (1961) and Havana (1962). He also played in both Piatigorsky Cup tournaments, held in 1963 and 1966. Just before his 60th birthday, he participated in the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, achieving an even score against the former world champion Mikhail Tal. Najdorf's lively personality made him a great favorite among chess fans, as he displayed an aptitude for witty sayings, in the manner of his mentor Tartakower. An example: commenting on his opponent at the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, he remarked, \\"When [then-World Champion Boris] Spassky offers you a piece, you might as well resign then and there. But when Tal offers you a piece, you would do well to keep playing, because then he might offer you another, and then another, and then ... who knows?\\" Najdorf remained active in chess to the end of his life. He won the South African Open in 1976 and at age 69, he tied for second place in a very strong field at Buenos Aires 1979, with 8/13, behind winner Bent Larsen (11/13), though ahead of former world champions Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky. At Buenos Aires 1988, he made a score of 8¬Ω/15 for fourth place at age 78. The next year in the 1989 Argentinian Championship, with several other GMs in the field, he tied for 4th‚Äì6th places, with 10/17. His last national championship was in 1991 at age 81, where he finished with a minus score. Najdorf was an exceptional blitz (five-minute) player, remaining a strong player into his 80s. Najdorf regarded Capablanca and Fischer as the greatest players of all time. Olympiad performances He played eleven times for Argentina in Chess Olympiads from 1950 to 1976. He played first board in the 9th Chess Olympiad at Dubrovnik 1950 (+8‚Äì0=6), as well as at Helsinki 1952 (+11‚Äì2=3), Amsterdam 1954, Moscow 1956, Leipzig 1960, Varna 1962, Havana 1966, Lugano 1968, Siegen 1970, and Haifa 1976. Only during the Olympiad at Nice 1974, he played on third board. Najdorf took eleven Olympic medals: seven for teams Poland and Argentina (four silver, three bronze), and four individuals (gold in 1939, 1950, and 1952, as well as one silver in 1962). Contributions The Najdorf Variation in the Sicilian Defense, one of the most popular openings in modern chess, is named after him. Najdorf also made contributions to the theory and praxis of other openings such as the King's Indian Defense. Najdorf was also a well-respected chess journalist, who had a popular column in the Buenos Aires Clar√≠n newspaper.

Najdorf's enthusiasm for, and virtuosity in conducting, the attack against the enemy king is well shown here, in a game praised by David Bronstein in his famous book on the tournament. It is also a good example of learning from one's defeats. Earlier that year, Gligoriƒá had beaten Najdorf with the same system. (Miguel Najdorf vs Svetozar Gligoric, Mar del Plata 1953). After the game, Don Miguel delivered his famous line: \\"Taimanov had better go and play his piano!\\" * Miguel Najdorf once played a game of chess with communist revolutionary Che Guevara; they drew. Personal life According to a biography by his younger daughter Liliana (b. 1952), Mojsze Mendel (\\"Mikel\\") Najdorf was the oldest of five children (four sons and one daughter) of Gdalik and Raisa Najdorf. When he was 14, he visited his school friend Ruben Fridelbaum's house, and his violinist father taught him chess. Mikel was immediately hooked, read books about the game, and was soon able to give his teacher rook odds. A musician friend introduced his fianc√©e Genia to Mikel, but Mikel and Genia fell in love, and Genia broke off her engagement and instead married Mikel. They had one daughter, Lusia. When Najdorf boarded the ship for the Buenos Aires Olympiad in 1939, Genia was ill with influenza, and chose not to accompany him. He arrived in Argentina in 21 August 1939. While the Olympiad was in progress, Najdorf's country was invaded and World War II began. Despite his best efforts, he never saw his family again. His father died in the Warsaw uprising, and his wife and daughter, and all his known relatives and friends, were murdered in the Holocaust. However, many years later, by chance he met a Polish immigrant in the New York City Subway, who turned out to be a cousin. In 1944, Najdorf became a naturalized citizen of Argentina. He had studied Latin at college, so easily picked up Spanish. Najdorf spoke eight languages, in addition to his native Polish and adopted Spanish, English, Russian, Czech, Serbo-Croat, Dutch, as well as Yiddish. In April 1947, he met Adela (\\"Eta\\"), one of the youngest of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac and Esther Jusid. They were married after only a few weeks of courtship. Adela was 11 years younger than Miguel. They had two daughters Mirta (b. 1948) and Liliana (b. 1952), and a miscarried son in between. Liliana was long resentful of the fact that her father was abroad when she was born, and did not see her until she was four months old. She describes her father as a mixture of extremes: violent temper but compassionate and loving, selfish at times but also generous to a fault, jovial and bon vivant but also sad because of the terrible losses of the Holocaust. Adela died on 21 August 1977, of an inoperable intestinal tumour. The family kept the diagnosis secret from her, while Miguel consulted the best oncologists in the US to no avail. Not long after Adela died, Najdorf married again, to Rita, who had been a widow for 12 years. Najdorf had met Rita and her husband Jacobo, a socialist attorney and keen chess player, soon after he arrived in Argentina. They became close family friends. Rita and Jacobo had no children of their own, but had many nieces and nephews, and they treated Miguel's daughters like nieces. The families would often get together, and the men would play and analyse chess and the women would talk. At one such gathering, when Liliana was 13, she saw Jacobo die suddenly at a chessboard. The widowed Rita became an even closer friend to Adela. After Adela died, Rita and Miguel became a couple, which Miguel's daughters accepted without surprise and with relief. Rita later developed Alzheimer's disease, and Miguel became physically frailer. In 1996, Miguel had a serious heart attack in Seville, which required a pacemaker insert. Upon returning to Argentina, he learned that Rita had been hospitalized with an intestinal blockage. He went to the hospital, and she recognized him despite her Alzheimer's, and begged him to take her home, while he kissed her tenderly. Unexpectedly, she died the next day.

The original building was constructed in 1837‚Äì47 and was designed by Ammi Burnham Young in the Greek Revival style. The tower was designed by Peabody and Stearns and was added in 1913‚Äì15. The building is part of the Custom House District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Standing at tall, the building is currently tied with The Hub on Causeway Residential Tower as Boston's 19th-tallest buildings. It is part of the Custom House District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. , it houses the Marriott Custom House Hotel. Original building Boston's Custom House Tower, resting on the original 1849 Custom House structure. The site was purchased on September 13, 1837. Construction of a custom house was authorized by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. When it was completed in 1849, it cost about $1.076 million, in contemporary U.S. currency, including the site, foundations, etc. Ammi Burnham Young entered an 1837 competition to design the Boston Custom House, and won with his neoclassical design. This building was a cruciform (cross-shaped) Greek Revival structure, combining a Greek Doric portico with a Roman dome, resembled a four-faced Greek temple topped with a dome. It had 36 fluted Doric columns, each carved from a single piece of granite from Quincy, Massachusetts; each weighed 42 tons (37 metric tons) and cost about $5,200. Only half these actually support the structure; the others are free-standing. They are and in diameter and high. Inside, the rotunda was capped with a skylight dome. The entire structure sits on filled land and is supported by 3,000 wooden piles driven through fill to bedrock. Before land reclamation was done in the middle of the 19th century, Boston's waterfront extended right to this building. Ships moored at Long Wharf almost touched the eastern face of the building. The Custom House was built at the end of the City docks, to facilitate inspection and registration of cargo. The federal government used the building to collect maritime duties in the age of Boston clipper ships. This description of the original Custom House appears in the 1850 Boston Almanac: The Custom House Tower as seen from the Boston waterfront during the Big Dig. The Custom House Tower. Painting of the Great Seal of the United States inside the original Custom House structure. Tower Customs House Tower clock By 1905, increased shipping required the building's expansion. In 1913‚Äì1915, the architecture firm Peabody and Stearns added the tower to the base. Although Boston at that time had a height restriction, the Custom House was federally owned and exempt from it. The new tower's made it the city's tallest. In 1947, the Old John Hancock Building, just one foot shorter, joined it in the skies over Boston. In 1964, it was exceeded by the Prudential Tower. The tower was completed in January 1915 after four and a half years of work. It cost about $1.8 million to build. The tower contains a rotunda made of Vermont white marble covered by a dome. Outside of the top floor is a balcony, which, at the time of the tower's opening, was said to have views of Mount Wachusett, the Peterboro Hills, and the shores of Cape Ann. The dedication ceremony was attended by Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Andrew James Peters, Collector Edmund Billings, Governor David I. Walsh, Mayor James Michael Curley, Cardinal William Henry O'Connell, Bishop William Lawrence, and the building's architect, Robert Swain Peabody. The tower was opened on January 23, 1915. The clock on the upper tower of the building is in diameter. It was started at noon on April 6, 1916. The clock cost $2,500. Its hands are made of copper-plated California redwood and weigh 101 and 141 pounds respectively. Because of an undersized motor, the clock failed to work properly through much of the 20th century. In 1960, the Great Seal of the United States was painted in the lobby's dome. The pendulum and other inner workings that control the Custom House Tower clock's four faces. Current use When custom officials moved into the Thomas P. O'Neill building in 1986, the Custom House was declared \\"surplus property\\". On April 16, 1987, the city of Boston purchased the building from the General Services Administration, and the building remained unoccupied and inaccessible for 14 years. The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Landmarks Commission, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Beal Companies, and Jung Brannen Associates, Inc. all proposed concepts for the use of the building that ranged from museums to offices to residential developments. In 1995, the Beal Companies and Marriott Ownership Resorts International announced plans to develop the building into a timeshare resort, and retained Jung Brannen Associates as architects. In 1997, work began to convert the building into an 87-room Marriott Vacation Club. One of the obstacles in converting the structure was the small amount of usable space on each floor of the tower, a problem that several earlier redevelopment plans faced and failed to overcome. The Jung Brannen team created ways to construct four to five suites per floor, using custom-designed built-in cabinetry and furnishings, to maximize the size and number of suites that could fit in the building. The end result was 87 one-bedroom suites with 22 different floor plans. Amenities included a private lounge, exercise area and game room and a refurbished observation deck on the tower's 26th floor. A rotunda-level maritime museum and exhibit room are among the public spaces that occupy the newly refurbished ground floor. Two visitors on the public viewing platform at the top of the Custom House Tower. Landscape designers Pressley Associates, Inc. redesigned the front plaza in 1999, and remarked: > It provides a new urban linkage space that provides a sense of cohesion > between Custom House Tower and Faneuil Hall and Marketplace Center. As part > of the current rehabilitation of the Tower to hotel use, the mandate of the > landscape architectural design was to unify and revitalize the urban > environment while respecting the buildings' historical importance.

The top of the tower is now accessible to the public during limited hours for a small fee. A fenced-in area surrounds the top floor and allows visitors to view the city on all sides of the tower.

Design  The original \\"lzop\\" implementation, released in 1996, was developed by Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer, based on earlier algorithms by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv. The LZO library implements a number of algorithms with the following characteristics: * higher compression speed compared to DEFLATE compression * very fast decompression * requires an additional buffer during compression (of size 8 kB or 64 kB, depending on compression level) * requires no additional memory for decompression other than the source and destination buffers * allows the user to adjust the balance between compression ratio and compression speed, without affecting the speed of decompression LZO supports overlapping compression and in-place decompression. As a block compression algorithm, it compresses and decompresses blocks of data. Block size must be the same for compression and decompression. LZO compresses a block of data into matches (a sliding dictionary) and runs of non-matching literals to produce good results on highly redundant data and deals acceptably with non- compressible data, only expanding incompressible data by a maximum of 1/64 of the original size when measured over a block size of at least 1 kB.  Implementations  The reference implementation is written in ANSI C, and it has been made available as free software under the GNU General Public License. The copyright for the code is owned by Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer. It was originally published in 1996. Oberhumer has also written a command-line frontend called lzop.

The caridoid escape reaction, also known as lobstering or tail-flipping, refers to an innate escape mechanism in marine and freshwater crustaceans such as lobsters, krill, shrimp and crayfish. The reaction, most extensively researched in crayfish, allows crustaceans to escape predators through rapid abdominal flexions that produce powerful swimming strokes‚Äîthrusting the crustacean backwards through the water and away from danger. The type of response depends on the part of the crustacean stimulated, but this behavior is complex and is regulated both spatially and temporally through the interactions of several neurons. Discovery of the first command neuron-mediated behavior The tail-flip escape behavior was first described in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii In 1946, C. A. G. Wiersma first described the tail-flip escape in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and noted that the giant interneurons present in the tail were responsible for the reaction. The aforementioned neuronal fibres consist of a pair of lateral giant interneurons and a pair of medial giant interneurons, and Wiersma found that stimulating just one lateral giant interneuron (LG or LGI) or one medial giant interneuron (MG or MGI) would result in the execution of a tail flip. Wiersma and K. Ikeda then proposed the term \\"command neuron\\" in their 1964 publication, and applied it to the giant interneuron's ability to command the expression of the escape response. This was the first description of a command neuron-mediated behavior and it indicated that the depolarization of a neuron could precipitate complex innate behaviors in some organisms. Chapter 7: Escape Behavior in Crayfish This concept was further fleshed out with more specific and stringent conditions in 1972 when Kupfermann and Weiss published The Command Neuron Concept. The paper stated that command neurons were neurons (or small sets of neurons) carrying the entire command signal for a natural behavioral response. According to the authors, command neurons were both necessary and sufficient in the production of a behavioral response. The concept of command neuron-mediated behaviors was both ground breaking and controversial, since determining command neuron- mediated behaviors was a problematic process due to difficulties in understanding and interpreting anatomical and behavioral data. Research with crayfish Behavioral neurobiologists in the field of neuroethology have researched this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii. Based on studies of P. clarkii it was discovered that the tail- flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits all unnecessary behaviors while generating a fixed action pattern for escape swimming. The type of escape response depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant tactile stimulus is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide tail fan region of the telson are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using a powerful abdominal flexions. The entire process occurs in a fraction of a second as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds). Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments. The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success. Anatomy involved Like other decapod crustaceans, the crayfish possesses a hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior portion of the crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, is characterized by the presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a tail fan, a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the telson. The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming. The anterior five segments of the crayfish house the massive flexor and extensor muscles. Six abdominal ganglia run down the entire length of the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections. The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and motor nerves innervating swimmerets while the second has sensory and motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia here also receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the tail fan. Each ganglion contains the body of one motor giant neuron (MoG), powerful and large bodied motor neurons whose projections innervate the five fast flexor (FF) muscles found in a segment and interact with them through chemical synapses. The ganglia also contain two sets of giant axons known as the lateral giant neurons and the medial giant neurons. These interneurons play important roles in escape swimming. Their large diameter allows for rapid conduction since there is less current leakage. Their projections extend through the third root in each ganglion, and Furshpan and Potter found that the synapses they subsequently made with the MoG passed depolarizing currents in a direct and unidirectional manner. These electrical synapses account for the speed of the escape mechanism and display some features of chemical synapses such as LTP and LTD. Variations in escape response characteristic depend on the location where the crayfish body is prodded or attacked and also depend on which of the giant neurons is stimulated. Response variants and their circuitry Medial giant- mediated escape The medial giants innervate the entire ventral nerve chord. Their cell bodies and dendrites begin in the brain and collect sensory information presented by visual and tactile stimuli. These fibers terminate in the last abdominal segment. The response is triggered by abrupt tactile stimuli to the head or alarming visual stimuli. This results in the firing of all motor giant (MoG) neurons and the flexion of all the phasic fast flexor (FF) muscles in the abdomen, which rapidly curls the tail fan and last three segments underneath the crayfish. This produces a thrust that directs water towards the offending stimulus while propelling the crayfish directly backward. This behavior is then followed by the extension of the tail, which prepares it for swimming or the execution of another tail-flip. The extension and swimming phases will be discussed in the next escape variant. Unfortunately, this variant of the tail-flip escape has not been extensively studied. Further studies should focus on this escape variant, paying special attention to exactly how visual information is processed and then converted into neuronal signals that produce a tail flip response. Non-giant escape Less abrupt or gradually intensifying stimuli evoke locomotion behavior similar to that seen in giant interneuron-mediated behaviors. However, the movements are less stereotyped and do not appear to occur in an all or nothing manner. They are so named because they lack the involvement of the giant interneurons, most likely because they do not produce depolarizations in the sensory neurons that are above the thresholds required to initiate these behaviors. Instead they involve one or a few of the smaller neurons innervating the tail. The latency periods for these escape mechanisms are longer, ranging from 80 to 500 ms. However, this slower swimming behavior allows for flexibility, since the crayfish can use visual stimuli and steer itself in a selected direction. Non-giant escape often occurs during situations where lateral or medial giant-mediated escape may not be beneficial or during times where those behaviors are suppressed. This allows the crayfish to attack offenders, escape during feeding, or wriggle free when it has been restrained by the carapace. Non-giant escape circuitry was found to be activated more during frontal attacks, but was rarely involved in the initial escape during a rear attack. Non-giant escape is often used after an initial giant interneuron-mediated tail flip. Compared to MG escape, the potentials produced in the MoG neurons by non-giant circuitry have lower amplitudes and longer durations while the recordings in the FF muscles are more erratic and have smaller amplitudes since they receive smaller EPSPs from the MoGs. So while it is hard to observe differences in MG and non-escapes, this property can be used to distinguish the two. Lateral giant-mediated escape The lateral giant (LG)-mediated escape mechanism is the most extensively analyzed form of the tail flip. The LG is not actually one neuron, but rather a group of closely associated neurons arranged end to end and connected by electrical synapses (also called septate synapses). As a result, the LGI functions as one giant, continuous neuron, such as the MG. The LGI's large diameter and the efficiency and speed of electrical synapses, make the LGI-mediated escape especially rapid and effective. The LGI only innervates the first three rostral segments of the tail and is activated within 10 ms from when a mechanical stimulus is presented to the abdomen. When flexion occurs, only the first three segments flex and the tail fan is not directed under the body and forward but rather straight down. The unflexed segments increase the length of the paddle. The result is the rear end of the animal is directed upward and forward causing the animal to tumble or somersault forward. The tail is then rapidly extended, and this is usually followed by directed swimming. The LGI is one of the few examples of a true command neuron. It passes the necessity and sufficiency principle put forward by Kupfermann and Weiss. Wiersma's initial experiments showed that direct stimulation of the LGI was a sufficient release for the tail flip. In 1981, it was Olson and Krasne who showed that the LGI fulfilled the condition of necessity, because when spikes were inhibited in the LGI through introducing a hyperpolarizing current, no motor activity was produced in response to a stimulus that would have originally elicited the tail flip. The LGI contains the following three phases, occurring over the span of about 100 ms: =1 ‚Äì Flexion production= The LGI receives its sensory input from the hair-like projections found on the edge of the tail fan. The sensory information is sent from bipolar receptors connected to the hair that are directionally sensitive. The path of the signal varies from here depending on the strength of the input. In the beta pathway, the signal can then pass a chemical synapse, the information is sent to a sensory interneuron (SI) of either type A (which fires phasically in response to input) or type C, (which fire tonically). From there, the signal is sent across an electrical synapse to the LGI. The LGI can also receive the sensory input directly through an electrical synapse by way of the alpha pathway. This bypasses the SIs. The LGI can pass the signal to the MoG's by two paths one of which passes the signal to the Motor Giant through direct electrical synapses. The MoG then passes the signal to the FF muscles. It can also use a second route across a fast electrical synapse to a premotor interneuron called the segmental giant (SG), two of which are located in each segment. The SGs then relays the signal to fast flexor motor neurons. The end result is a powerful and rapid flexion. The convergence many inputs on the LGI and divergence of few signals show how the LGI functions as a decision making coincidence detector. It takes the information from both the alpha and the beta pathways and if the timing of the spikes is synchronous, the behavior is produced. If the timing is asynchronous, the later input is blocked by reducing the driving force of the signal and increasing the threshold voltage. The early synapse also causes current to leak through the active synapse, resulting in weak EPSPs that are ultimately unable to generate the tail flip. A number of processes are inhibited once the initial flexion has begun. Further LGI spiking, influx of sensory information from the tail, MoG spiking and FF contraction are all inhibited so that a flexion and extension cycle can be completed before another flexion begins. Long IPSPs are generated to prevent these events. The extensor muscles are inhibited to prevent competition between the extensor and flexors. Rapid IPSPs presented at the muscle receptor organ (MRO) prevent the stretch receptor from initiating extension while they are also presented at the fast extensor motor neurons and the fast extensor muscles. The circuits responsible for slow flexion and extension are also inhibited. =2 ‚Äì Reextension= When the LGI-mediated inhibition subsides, the reextension process begins. This process is mediated by the MRO and tail fan hair receptors, which were inhibited during the flexion portion of the escape behavior. The MRO is responsible for the initiation of extension and the inhibition of flexion through a reflex like mechanism. The muscle fibers of the MRO are located on the dorsal side of the abdomen, each spanning the joint of two segments. They are innervated by proprioreceptors that detect the stretch in extensor muscles when the flexors are contracted. They then fire phasically or tonically. It then excites the motor neurons in the fast extensor muscles while directly exciting an inhibitory neuron that prevents contractions in the FF muscles. The hair cells detect the resulting movement caused by the tail flip when activated, they would fire and excite the fast extensor motor neurons. =3 ‚Äì Swimming= Non-giant-mediated responses are initiated after the tail flip, creating cycles of flexion followed by extension. This non-giant system is activated parallel to the LGI circuit when the hair cells receive input. However, this behavior has a longer delay that allows the onset of swimming to occur after the completion of the tail flip. The non-giant swimming occurs independently of the LGI response since direct stimulation of the LGI with the electrodes results in a tail flip but not the subsequent non-giant swimming. This swimming response seems to be a fixed action pattern mediated by a central pattern generator since it does not require sensory feedback for physical and temporal maintenance. Modulation and plasticity of the response The production of a tail flip is not always beneficial. Evolution has allowed the crayfish to be more flexible by presenting several control systems that will prevent the tail flip in situations where it will most likely be unnecessary or ineffective. Eating Crayfish often find themselves in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary. Carapace restraint When a crayfish is held by its carapace either in the water or in the air, it does not respond with a tail flip when it receives sensory stimuli that would normally elicit the response. This inhibitory behavior does not seem to be mediated by the abdomen. When the thorax-abdomen junction is severed, the inhibitory effect is lost and the LGI in severed abdomen generates strong spikes since its threshold had decreased substantially. This is an indication that the behavior is mediated in the brain or the thorax of the crayfish. Most non-giant and MGI tail flips are also suppressed by restraint, so only a few non-giant systems are active to allow the crayfish to carefully wriggle free. The setup of this system seems to be designed to prevent the unnecessary use of all or nothing tail flips or ineffective tail flips when the situation requires more careful maneuvering. The tail flip normally induces inhibition in an absolute fashion, such that it takes precedence over all the other tasks the segments are performing. However, during these situations, the effectiveness of the tail flip is reduced, so the inhibitory processes need to occur in a relative manner and a tail flip should occur only if absolutely necessary. During absolute inhibition is directed by more proximal synapses controlling the spike-initiating zones of the LGI. It is most likely that during restraint or feeding, the inhibitory process is mediated by inhibitory synaptic input on distal dendrites of the LGI . As a result, these signals would have to compete with other inputs for the control of the LGI. Learning Repeated tapping of the abdomen leads to habituation of the tail flip mechanism. However, self‚Äìhabituation is prevented by command neuron‚Äìderived inhibition because when a tail flip is begun, the mechanisms that induce habituation are repressed. The habituation occurs at the level of the A type and C type interneurons, which experience synaptic depression. The habituation process is also mediated further up the circuit through the buildup of tonic inhibition, brought on by the repeated stimulation. Social status The feedback from social situations affect a crayfish's ability to perform a tail flip. Serotonin levels are affected by social status. High levels are associated with aggressive behavior and a reduction in the frequency of tail flips performed. This is because the excitability of the LGI is decreased. Aggressive dominant males have a moderate reduction in tail flips while the subordinates have a much lower occurrence of tail flips. This presents a paradox since this means that subordinates are more likely to get killed. However, it was found that subordinates are more likely to use non-giant- mediated escape, indicating that the reduction in tail flips and enhancement of non giant escape is adaptive. Changes in social status should correlate with changes in serotonin levels, resulting in changes in the escape strategies used by the crayfish. However this is only true when submissive crayfish become dominant, and not the reverse. The neuromodulatory processes of facilitation and inhibition seem to be mediated by different cell receptors. Differences in the effects of serotonin on the behavior of the crayfish seem to be the result of differences in the populations of these receptors. It is unknown how these modulation processes convey the information to the LG, and how the behavioral changes are precipitated. Evolution of the tail flip escape mechanism It has been hypothesized that the tail flip is derived from an ancient limb protraction driven (as opposed to tail flexion-driven) mechanism. This is because the SGs appear to be modified limb motor neurons whose peripheral axons affect the legs and swimmerets, but end blindly without any known function. It is known that another effect of Giant Fiber excitation is limb promotion which suggests that the premotor limb interneurons may be ancestors of the Giant Fibers. It has been speculated that the ancestral escape mechanism was most likely a backwards jump due to the simultaneous protraction of the legs driven by the ancestors of the Giant Fibers. This behavior was probably similar to the escape system found in a mantis shrimp called Squilla that diverged from the crayfish lineage very early on. It is likely that this mechanism was replaced by the tail flip since the wide surface area of the tail made this behavior more selectively advantageous. This most likely occurred when the ancestral flexor motor neurons in each segment formed connections with one of these limb motor neurons. The Squilla mechanism seems be similar to this ancestral state because a large diameter axon in the dorsal nerve chord facilitates limb promoter motor neurons. This seems to match the ancestral condition, but it is not known for sure whether the circuitry is homologous.

The Mandarin Oriental name was established in 1985 following the merger of Mandarin International Hotels Limited and the holding company of the hotel The Oriental, in which Mandarin had already acquired a 49% stake in 1974. Mandarin's history traces back to the 1963 opening of its namesake hotel The Mandarin (now Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong), whereas The Oriental (now Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok) had opened in 1876 as the Kingdom of Siam's first luxury hotel. MOHG is a subsidiary of the publicly-traded Mandarin Oriental International Limited, which itself is a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson. History Although 1876 was the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‚ÄòOriental‚Äô side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865. However, the history of the ‚ÄòMandarin‚Äô side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which closed in 2019, opened in Causeway Bay. In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two \\"flagship\\" hotels for the company. In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of \\"Mandarin Oriental International Limited.\\" Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group's hotels.

The name literally means apple slices in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. The crust is similar in texture to European pancakes, but with a light and fluffy innard like a popover. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver. √Übleskiver pan Top view of an √¶bleskiver pan. √Übleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration. Preparation An √¶bleskive with red jam The batter for √¶bleskiver usually includes wheat flour, which is mixed with buttermilk, milk or cream, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Some recipes also include fat (usually butter), cardamom and lemon zest to improve taste, and a leavening agent, most often baking powder, but sometimes yeast, to aerate the batter. Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the √¶bleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of apple (√¶ble) or applesauce inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. √Übleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, black currant or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Butter, maple syrup, and whipped cream are also popular toppings. √Übleskiver can be bought fried and frozen at supermarkets, only needing heating in an oven. Traditions A man making √¶bleskiver at the Danish American Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota In Denmark, √¶bleskiver are less common in restaurants than they are at casual family gatherings. They can also be found being sold by street vendors in the winter. They are traditionally served with jam and powdered sugar and three are placed on a plate at a time. They are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gl√∏gg, (Scandinavian mulled wine) or Scandinavian coffee. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, open-air events, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children's birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments. In North America there are several annual events that celebrate √¶bleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \\"√Übleskiver Suppers\\" and similar events.  History  The exact origin of √¶bleskiver is unknown. One popular speculation is that a band of Vikings were part of a difficult battle. When they returned to their ship, they wished to cook a meal similar to pancakes. However, since they lacked regular pans, they instead used their shields or helmets, resulting in a cake with a spherical shape. See also *, A south Indian breakfast and evening snack.

Resembling small, fluffy pancakes, they are made with yeast and buckwheat flour. They have a light, spongy texture. Typically, poffertjes are a sweet treat, served with powdered sugar and butter, and sometimes syrup or advocaat. However, there is also a savoury variant with gouda cheese. History Poffertjes, also known as 'brothers', originated from a Catholic tradition. In the churches in the south of the Netherlands, sacremental hosts were used during the communion ceremony. Because the host was very dry, the brothers started experimenting with different recipes. From these culinary experiments the poffertjes that we know today have emerged. The south of the present-day Netherlands was traditionally Catholic, so the traditions deviated from the Protestant north. Because the hosts are part of a Catholic tradition, it is suspected that the Poffertjes were created in the provinces of Limburg or Noord Brabant. Servings Poffertjes are a festive holiday treat in the Netherlands, popular at both summer festivals and Christmas markets. Mainly in the winter season temporary stands selling poffertjes are quite popular and sell portions containing one or two dozen. Usually the cook prepares them fresh for the customer. They are sold on a small cardboard (sometimes plastic) plate and come with a small disposable fork the size of a pastry fork. Poffertjes are not difficult to prepare, but a special cast iron pan or copper pan (also available in aluminium with Teflon coating) with several shallow indentations in the bottom is required. Almost all Dutch supermarkets (like Albert Heijn, Lidl & Jumbo) sell ready-made poffertjes that only need to be microwaved, and are sold complete with a sachet of powdered sugar and a small serving of butter. Supermarkets also stock mixes for poffertjes, to which only eggs and milk need to be added. Usually they contain some kind of leavening agent like baking powder. Poffertjes can also be served with other sweet garnishes, such as syrup, whipped cream or strawberries, for added flavour. Poffertjes are also known in Indonesian cuisine through its historical ties as the former Dutch colony.

Situated on the main route between nearby Bedford and Milton Keynes, the village was bypassed by the A422 in April 1992, to allow the increasing amount of traffic to avoid the 30 mph speed limit in Stagsden. The village has at its centre St. Leonard's Church, where High Street, Bedford Road and Church Lane all meet. Toward the western end of the village, along High Street, is the Royal George pub (now closed) and the Village Hall (formerly the primary school). The village's history is well preserved, and several millennium projects centred on such preservation for future generations. In 2000, Stagsden acquired two new additions to village life. A Millennium bench was put in place at the corner of Bedford Road and the High Street, and Bedfordshire Golf Club opened its newly built course on the hillside facing the village, on the other side of the A422. A latecomer to the 21st century is the village sign, next to the church, which is a quintessentially rural affair and is rather splendid. For electoral purposes the village is part of Turvey ward and is represented on Bedford Borough Council by Mark Smith, elected in May 2007. Half a mile east of Stagsden and inside the parish boundary is Hanger Wood, an ancient woodland and Site of Special Scientific Interest. Stagsden is home to the British Tripod Brand, 3 Legged Thing. The brand stamps the name \\"Stagsden\\" onto each and every product that they manufacture as a tribute to the village. 3 Legged Thing is situated in two Chicken Sheds ( Shedquarters [Unit 9] & Return of the Shedi [Unit 10] ), on the site of Kinsbourne Farm, Bury End, previously a poultry farm that was home to over 30,000 chickens.

Money generated helps local charities. The pub named the Air Hostess recalls Nottingham Airport at Tollerton. It is unusual in having a piste for playing p√©tanque. It used to have a large carved sign depicting an air hostess. However, in 2011, the then owners of the premises, Everards Brewery, decided to refurbish them and in doing so removed the original sign.

It is not to be confused with Frit Forum, which is for those in higher education, and whose membership is not restricted by age, unlike the DSU. The organisation is autonomous from the Social Democrats and as such is entitled to formulate its own policies and devise its own campaigns. The Social Democratic Youth movement was established in 1920 after a break-up of the former youth organisation, the Social Democratic Youth League (', SUF). At first, the organisation was known as the \\"DsU\\". The founders of DSU wanted to change the Danish society by gradual reforms and not by revolution.  Affiliations  DSU is a member of Dansk Ungdoms F√¶llesr√•d (DUF), the Forbundet Nordens Socialdemokratiske Ungdom (FNSU), the Young European Socialists (YES) and the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).

It consists of 235 delegates, mainly elected in the local branches. The convention is approving the annual accounts of the national organisation, it is deciding new organizational work programmes, political resolutions and proposals and is finally electing a national executive committee. The national executive committee (\\"Forretningsudvalget\\") consists of 10 elected members and also the Chairperson, the Vice-Chairperson and the Secretary General. They are elected at the convention too. The Chairperson, the Vice-Chairperson and the Secretary General are receiving an economic compensation/fee for their jobs. Above the national executive committee, DSU has a kind of \\"second chamber\\", the major council Hovedbestyrelsen, which consists of the national executive committee (13 members) and 29 local representatives, elected in the 10 regions. The Social Democrats and Frit Forum, the Social Democrats' student wing, have one observer each. Hovedbestyrelsen is also the highest the most powerful assembly between conventions. DSU has three different nationwide, permanent committees with members from all levels in the organization and from everywhere in Denmark. The committees have the following topics and tasks: * Activities and seminars (planning of national events etc.) (abb. \\"AKU\\" ) * International affairs and cooperation (abb. \\"IU\\") * Editor's group, Members' magazine (\\"DSU'eren\\") DSU is divided into 10 regions, following the borders of the Danish major constituencies. Each region has a regional executive committee and is every year electing their local representatives to Hovedbestyrelsen. DSU has around 60 local branches, though these may come and go at any moment and is therefore not an exact figure. The local branches are responsible for local activities and local campaigns.

He appeared on many recordings in his short career, both as a sideman and as a leader. Little performed with Max Roach, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy and was strongly influenced by Sonny Rollins and Clifford Brown. He died at age 23. Biography Little was born in Memphis, Tennessee. He was the fourth child of Booker, a Pullman porter (who was also a trombonist) and his wife, Ophelia (who played piano). Little graduated from Manassas High School. He studied trumpet at the Chicago Conservatory with Joseph Summerhill from 1956 to 1958 and it was during this time that he worked with leading local musicians such as Johnny Griffin. Later, after moving to New York, while he lived with Sonny Rollins, Little became associated with drummer Max Roach and multi- instrumentalist Eric Dolphy, recording with them both as a sideman and a leader. With Dolphy, he co-led a residency at the Five Spot club in New York in June 1961, from which three albums were eventually issued by the Prestige label. It was during this stint that he began to show promise of expanding the expressive range of the \\"vernacular\\" bebop idiom which originated with Clifford Brown, his most obvious influence as a performer. He also appeared on Dolphy's album Far Cry (New Jazz 8270), recorded on December 21, 1960. Little died of complications resulting from uremia on October 5, 1961, in New York City. He was survived by his wife, two sons (Booker T.

It appears in numerous computer and video games of many genres, most commonly in role-playing video games. The term status effect can be applied both to changes that provide a character an advantage (increased attributes, defensive barriers, regeneration), and those that hinder the character (decreased attributes, incapacitation, degeneration). Especially in MMORPGs, beneficial effects are referred to as buffs, and hindering effects are called debuffs. Acquiring and removing status effects A status effect in the abstract is a persistent consequence of a certain in-game event or action, and as such innumerable variants exist across the gaming field. Status effects may result from one character performing a certain type of attack on another. Players may acquire status effects by consuming items, casting spells on themselves or each other, activating devices in the world, interacting with NPCs, or remaining in a particular location. Meeting certain criteria may result in the character acquiring a condition, which can have a status effect associated with it; for example: if their hunger level is high they may acquire a 'starving' condition, which produces a status effect that reduces their health regeneration. Some games offer permanent status effects which persist for an entire level and act as modifications to the game's native difficulty. The process of removing a status effect varies as widely as the effects themselves. Some status effects expire after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Most games contain items capable of healing specific status effects, or rarer items which can heal all of them. Many games also include magic spells that can eliminate status effects. Status effects are often removed at the end of a battle or once the originating enemy is defeated, however some may persist until they are explicitly cured. Games which allow players to rest may remove some status effects when that action is taken. If a game has multiple classes, one will often be a class capable of healing, who will have a greater ability to remove negative status effects than other classes. In addition, many games have weapons, armor, or other equipment that can mitigate status effects or prevent a character from getting one in the first place. Depending on the game, some increase the chance to escape suffering the effect each time the player may potentially receive it, while others grant complete immunity. However, sometimes the equipment that is resisting an effect, will in exchange, as a penalty, increase vulnerability against a different effect, offering the player the opportunity to make tactical choices. Buffs and debuffs In many MMORPGs, the terms buff and debuff are commonly used to describe status effects. Some spells or powers may debuff an enemy while buffing an ally at the same time. Buffs Buff is the term generically used to describe a positive status effect that affects mainly player or enemy statistics (usually cast as a spell). Examples of buffs include: * Increasing the movement speed of the target. * Increasing the attack speed of the target. * Increasing the health points of the target. * Increasing the target's perception. * Increasing the target's physical defense. * Healing the target over time for a period of time. * Boosting the damage output of the target. Debuffs Debuffs are effects that may negatively impact a player character or a non-player character in some way other than reducing their hit points. Some examples of debuffs are: * Reducing the movement speed of the target. * Reducing the attack speed of the target. * Decreasing the resistance of the target to various elements or forms of attack. * Reducing the stats of the target. * Crippling the target's perception. * Lowering the target's physical defense. * Draining the target's health capacity. * Removing the target's health over time while the status effect is active. There are countless other debuffs, depending on the game played, though all share the same concept: to make a certain target less powerful in one or more aspects. Both buffs and debuffs are generally of a temporary nature, wearing off after a certain period of time. Auras Many modern real-time strategy games have hero units, single units that are powerful, but limited in number (usually only one of a single type allowed). In addition to their normally very high stats, many heroes also have auras which confer beneficial status effects or attribute bonuses to any friendly units that enter within a certain radius of the hero. This makes the hero unit an important factor in an engagement as, in addition to their formidable combat skills and powerful abilities, they also make the units around them more effective. Some heroes and spellcaster units can also confer or inflict buffs, debuffs, and other status effects to units as spells.

History Founded by Carl F. Herman von Rosen on December 8, 1904, more than a decade before its mother party, KU is the oldest youth political organisation in Denmark and the oldest remaining youth political organisation in the world. Following its formation, KU grew quickly as an organisation and many local branches throughout Denmark sprung up. Later prominent party members were chairmen of KU in this period, most notably John Christmas M√∏ller, a historic figure in Danish politics, exiled in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, and celebrated as one of the reasons why Denmark was counted among the allied forces after World War II, despite of its collaboration with Germany. KU is most famous for three periods of history - the massive growth during the 1930s, the resistance fight during World War II, and the ideological awakening of the 1980s. The 1930s In the early 1930s KU experienced a major increase in membership and peaked at more than 30,000 members under the leadership of chairman Jack G. Westergaard. KU became somewhat of an institution by being the first non-leftist organization to use 'modern campaign methods', such as posters, pamphlets, marches, demonstrations and gatherings. Hosting open-air meetings with thousands of participants, demonstrating in the parks of Copenhagen, and flying over Copenhagen in propeller airplanes with conservative air leaflets became the trademark of the organization. One such incidence, when Copenhagen was plastered with thousands of campaign posters in a single night - is this day commemorated in the official KU song. Like other youth organisations of the era, KU also took a critical stance towards democracy in the early 1930s, and the ability of democracy to handle the economical and societal crisis that the West was facing. Parts of KU wanted to replace parliamentarism with a corporative system and found symbolic inspiration in fascist Italy and Germany. This reflected itself in the green uniforms and leather straps members of KU wore and the formation of 'Stormtropperne', a security patrol designed to protect open-air speakers from violent assaults by socialists. The German Sturmabteilung was the inspiration. This more unfortunate period of KU history is something the organization still struggles with, even though many KU-organisations around the country still own banners from that period, with the local branches in Gentofte and Aarhus being examples of this. The uniformation, and the formation of a security patrol was also used by the young social democrats and the young communists, but has since been ascribed solely to KU. The uniformation only lasted for 3 days before it was banned by the Danish parliament following a violent incident in which a young social democrat from 'DSU' killed a young communist in a bar brawl. It has also been insinuated by layman history, most notably in the popular Danish TV-series 'Matador', that KU was directly inspired by Nazism and anti-semitism, which, however, was never the case, and has since been rebutted by history. Following the growth of fascism in Europe, Jack Westergaard and his supporters in KU simultaneously lost momentum in the organisation, and were excluded, as the tides - with later party leader Aksel M√∏ller as new chairman - began to change. KU during WWII On April 9, 1940, German troops rolled over the Danish border as part of Operation Weser√ºbung, which immediately became the beginning of the infamous and much-debated collaboration between Nazi Germany and the Danish Government. Whilst most of the Danish population did not approve of the collaboration, many saw little reason to fight, or did not begin doing so until after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was breached in 1941, whereafter communists joined the fight. KU's young conservatives were therefore among the first to pick up any real resistance, viewing the collaboration policy led by the government as national treason committed by the Social Democrats and the Danish Social Liberal Party, the two parties in government which had disarmed Denmark in the preceding years from being the heaviest armed country in Europe to one of the least militarized in the late 1930s. A young conservative, Arne Sejr, wrote 'Danskerens Regler' (The Rules of the Dane) on the very day of the invasion, and instigated civil disobedience and sabotage of Nazi rule. As the war went on, thousands of members of KU began committing illegal sabotage, writing illegal papers and employing guerilla tactics. Typically the recruitment of freedom fighters took place in 'terr√¶nsportsforeninger' (terrain sports clubs) which were legal gymnastics clubs that arranged orienteering, but also functioned as a cover for recruitment and training camps, employing military-like training exercises. To this day KU's legendary 'Konsulentkursus' (KK) (Consultant Course) exists, which albeit in a moderated form works in a similar way, and each year attracts young conservatives who go through a selection procedure. Due to the chaotic period, it is unfortunately impossible to state the exact number of casualties, but more than 50 KU members are believed to have given their lives in a fight for the freedom of Denmark - more than any other youth organisation during the resistance. Bjarne Reuter, a popular and much appraised Danish author, has written the bestseller The Boys from St. Petri (Drengene fra Skt. Petri), a story of a group of young boys who form a resistance group and repeatedly sabotage and destroy Nazi installations until they are finally caught and sent to a concentration camp. The Boys from St. Petri is, in fact, the dramatization of the true story of 'Aalborg KU', and their resistance fight. KU after the war Shortly after the war ended on May 5, 1945, KU experienced a large increase in members again. Two legendary characters in Danish politics, former minister of justice Erik Ninn-Hansen and former prime-minister Poul Schl√ºter were chairmen during this period. In the 1960s KU considered changing its name to 'Centrum', and the local branch Odense KU even proposed a resolution introducing economic democracy, termed '√òD' in Denmark at the given period of time. This is to be seen as a result of the spring of 1968, and the drastic drop in membership as the agenda was now mostly set by the left and the hippie- and peace-movement. Any major changes in politics, however, never happened, and the name, as well as the logo, stuck with KU. KUs renaissance in the 1980s In the 1980s, as Poul Schl√ºter became party leader and later prime minister, and inspired by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and the conservative wave sweeping over the Western hemisphere, KU experienced a renaissance in membership. Once again as in the 1930s, KU set the agenda in many areas of the public debate, and members of KU went on to become today's leading voices in the political debate on libertarian and economically conservative issues. Since then KU has gone down in membership, but is now once again experiencing an increase in membership and recently gained 800 members in 3 weeks through its kapitalist.dk campaign. The national congress in 2006 drew more than 250 delegates, something which has not been seen in KU for many years. KU today At the mother party convention in 2005, after heavy research including an interview with former Estonian prime minister Mart Laar, KU proposed a resolution committing the party to a flat tax system, instead of the current progressive Danish tax system. The resolution which was narrowly defeated, caught enormous attention in the media, and the following day, Berlingske Tidende, one of the largest papers in the country, praised KU for its audacity and talent and proclaimed that KU was the political future of tomorrow. The current executive board consists of: Magnus Von Dreiager (Lyngby-Taarb√¶k KU) (National Chairman), Cecilia Zade Iseni (Fures√∏ KU) (National Deputy Chairman) and the board, Jeppe Frank Christensen (Odense KU), Anders Callisen (Randers KU), Christian Hildebrandt (KU i K√∏benhavn), Lasse Kl√∏cker (Slagelse KU) and Dianna C. Pedersen (Aalborg Ku). Honorary and prominent members KU has many former members that have since gone into particularly politics, academia and business, and founded successful international companies or become professors or ministers of government. The Danish freedom institution Libertas was also founded by members of KU. Many of the founders of CEPOS were current or former members of KU. In 2004 former Prime Minister Poul Schl√ºter was awarded the honorary membership of KU for excellence in political leadership and for the distribution of conservatism in Danish politics.

In July 1966, the German magazine \\"Alpinismus\\", published a photo of Alpamayo taken by American photographer Leigh Ortenburger accompanied by an article on a survey among mountaineering experts, who chose Alpamayo as \\"The Most Beautiful Mountain in the World\\".  Climbing history and routes  Most popular routes start from the village of Caraz, on the north of the Cordillera Blanca. A French-Belgian expedition including George and Claude Kogan claimed to have made the first ascent in 1951. After studying the photos in George Kogan's book The Ascent of Alpamayo, the German team of G. Hauser, F. Knauss, B. Huhn & H. Wiedmann came to the conclusion that the 1951 team did not reach the actual summit, thereby making their ascent via the north ridge in 1957 the first. The most common climbing route, known as the Ferrari route, is situated on the southwest face of the mountain. It was opened in 1975 by a group of Italian alpinists led by Casimiro Ferrari. It is considered a difficult climb, demanding good crampon and ice-climbing technique. There are incomparable views of steep ice faces, penitentes, gigantic white walls and ridges like those of Huandoy Norte, Artesonraju and Huascaran Norte, similar to the finest of the Himalayan scenery. There are also at least six other alternative climbing routes, the second most popular being the Vasque-French route.

It has a range of up to and can carry nuclear warheads. Kh-55 is launched exclusively from bomber aircraft and has spawned a number of conventionally armed variants mainly for tactical use, such as the Kh-65SE and Kh-SD, but only the Kh-101 and Kh-555 appear to have made it into service. Contrary to popular belief, the Kh-55 was not the basis of the submarine- and ground- launched S-10 Granat or RK-55 Relief (SS-N-21 'Sampson' and SSC-X-4 'Slingshot') designed by NPO Novator. The RK-55 is very similar to the air- launched Kh-55 (AS-15 'Kent') but the Kh-55 has a drop-down turbofan engine and was designed by MKB Raduga. Both have formed the basis of post-Cold-War missiles, in particular the Sizzler which has a supersonic approach phase. A Kh-55 production unit was delivered to Shanghai in 1995 and appears to have been used to produce a similar weapon for China. Development In the late 1960s, the \\"Ekho\\" study conducted by the GosNIIAS institute concluded that it would be more effective to deploy many small, subsonic cruise missiles than the much more expensive supersonic missiles then in favour. Work started at the Raduga bureau on an air-launched cruise missile in 1971, with a first test flight in 1976. The appearance of the US Air Force's AGM-86 ALCM in that year gave further impetus to the programme, with the Soviet Air Force issuing a formal requirement for a new air-launched cruise missile in December 1976. The longer-range Kh-55SM was developed a few years after the original went into service. In the late 1980s work began on a replacement missile with either conventional (Kh-101) or nuclear (Kh-102) warheads and greater stealth. It was designed by Igor Seleznyev of Raduga. The importance of advanced missiles as \\"force multipliers\\" increased as Russia's fleet of available cruise-missile bombers declined in the early 1990s. The cancellation of the ambitious Kh-90 ramjet missile due to INF treaty in 1987 led to a renewed emphasis on improving the Kh-55, in particular to achieve the <20 m accuracy required to hit infrastructure targets with conventional - as opposed to nuclear - warheads. First flight of the Kh-101 was in 1998, and evaluation trials started in 2000. After the end of the Cold War and anti-proliferation treaties restricting the deployment of long-range nuclear missiles, the Russians made efforts to develop tactical versions of the Kh-55 with conventional warheads. First came the 600 km-range Kh-65SE (derived from the Kh-55) announced in 1992, then the 300 km-range Kh-SD tactical version of the Kh-101 for export, and finally the Kh-555. In 2001 the Russian Air Force are believed to have selected the Kh-101 and Kh-555 for development. A 1995 Russian document suggested a complete production facility had been transferred to Shanghai, for the development of a nuclear-armed cruise missile. Originally it was thought that this was based on the 300 km-range Raduga Kh-15 (AS-16 'Kickback'), but it now appears that it was the Kh-55 that was transferred to China. Kh-101/102 Latest development of the Kh-55, incorporating a low radar cross-section of about 0.01 square meters. The Kh-101/102 is specifically designed for air-launch, abandoning the circular fuselage cross-section of the Kh-55 for a nose and forward fuselage section \\"aerodynamically shaped\\" to produce lift. It is long with a launch weight of and is equipped with a high- explosive, penetrating, or cluster warhead, or a 250 kT nuclear warhead for the Kh-102. The missile is powered by a TRDD-50A turbojet producing 450 kg (990 lb) of thrust to cruise at with a maximum speed of while flying 30‚Äì70 m (100‚Äì230 ft) above the ground, and hit fixed targets using a pre-downloaded digital map for terrain following and GLONASS/INS for trajectory correction to achieve accuracy of 6‚Äì10 meters; it is claimed to be able to hit small moving targets like vehicles using a terminal electro-optical sensor or imaging infrared system. Range estimates vary from >, to , to as much as with a flight endurance of 10 hours; long range is essential since Russia has few bases abroad and cannot provide distant fighter escorts. The Tu-95MS can carry eight of the weapons on four under-wing pylons and the Tu-160 can be outfitted with two drum launchers each loaded with six missiles for 12 total, but the smaller Tu-22M3 will continue to carry the Kh-555, although it can also carry the Kh-101/Kh-102. The missiles are equipped with an onboard EW defence system as of late 2018.Russia to field Kh-101 cruise missile next year - Flightglobal.com, 27 September 2012Ready for War: Russia's Stealthy Kh-101 Cruise Missile Debuts in Syria - Nationalinterest.org, 18 November 2015Russian bombers deploy Kh-101 cruise missiles over Syria - Flightglobal.com, 19 November 2015Latest Russian Strikes on Syria Employ New Cruise Missile - Ainonline.com, 20 November 2015Tactical Missiles Corporation plans to upgrade Kh-101 cruise missile - Airrecognition.com, 18 August 2016 The first tests were conducted in 1995 and the missile was accepted for service in 2012. Design R-95-300 turbofan It is powered by a single 400 kgf Ukrainian-made, Motor Sich JSC R95-300 turbofan engine, with pop-out wings for cruising efficiency. It can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300 ft altitude). After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an inertial guidance system plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with a high degree of accuracy. The original Kh-55 had a drop-down engine; the Kh-65SE had a fixed external turbojet engine, while the Kh-SD had its engine inside the body of the missile. Current-production versions are equipped with the increased power of 450 kgf Russian-made NPO Saturn TRDD-50A engine. Operational history A Tu-160 bomber launching a Kh-101 cruise missile against targets in Syria, November 2015 The original Kh-55 entered service in 31 December 1983. The Kh-55SM followed in 1987. The conventionally armed Kh-55SE was flight tested on 13 January 2000, and first used in exercises over the Black Sea 17‚Äì22 April 2000. The Kh-555 is thought to have entered service in 2004, the first pictures of the Kh-101 appeared in 2007. The Kh-55 can be carried by the Tu-95MS ('Bear-H') and Tu-142M ('Bear-F'), and the Kh-55SM is carried by the Tupolev Tu-160 ('Blackjack'). Sixteen Kh-55's can be carried by the Tu-95MS16 variant, ten on underwing hardpoints and six on an MKU-5-6 rotary launcher. The missile was also tested on the Tu-22M ('Backfire') bombers. The Kh-SD tactical version was to have been carried by the Tu-95MS (fourteen missiles) and the Tu-22M (eight missiles). The Kh-101 is expected to be carried by the Tu-160 (twelve missiles), Tu-95MS16 (eight missiles), Tu-22M3 (four missiles) and Su-34 (two missiles). The end of the Cold War left Ukraine with 1,612 Kh-55s, part of the armament of the 19 Tu-160s of the 184th Heavy Bomber Regiment at Pryluky and the 25 Tu-95MSs of the 182nd Heavy Bomber Regiment at Uzin-Shepelovka. It was reported that Ukraine demanded US$3 billion for the return of the planes and their missiles to Russia. In October 1999, a compromise was reached that saw Russia pay US$285 million for eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS bombers and 575 Kh-55 cruise missiles, while the rest were meant to be destroyed under U.S.-led Nunn‚ÄìLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction programme. However, in March 2005 Ukraine's prosecutor-general Sviatoslav Piskun said that in 2001, 12 Kh-55s had been exported to Iran in a deal allegedly worth US$49.5 million. Additional six Kh-55s were exported to China. In March 2015, Iran subsequently revealed the existence of the Soumar cruise missile with a design and range comparable to the Kh-55. In the course of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War on 17 November 2015, Russian Defence Ministry reported that Tupolev Tu-95MS and Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers launched a total of 34 air- launched cruise missiles against 14 ISIL targets in Syria. While the Tu-95MS used the Kh-55 cruise missiles, the Tu-160 were equipped with the stealthy Kh-101 variant in their first combat use. On 17 November 2016, modernized Tu-95MS armed with the Kh-555 and Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles launched airstrikes against terrorist targets in Syria. Video showing Russian TU-95MS launching Kh-101 cruise missiles in September 2017 at targets in northern Syria. On 17 February 2017, the Tu-95MS strategic bombers, flying from the Russian territory through the airspace of Iran and Iraq, attacked purported ISIL facilities near the Syrian city of Raqqa with the Kh-101 cruise missiles. The targets included purported militant camps and training centers as well as a command center of a major ISIL unit. Russian Tu-95MS long-range bombers struck Daesh targets in Syria again on 5 July 2017, strikes were made from a range of about 1,000 kilometers. On 26 September 2017, Russia's Tu-95MS strategic bombers carried out further missile strikes with Kh-101 on ISIS and the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda (now known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) in the provinces of Idlib and Deir Ezzor. Variants * Kh-55 (NATO 'Kent-A', RKV-500A, Izdeliye 120) - original model with 2,500 km range. * Kh-55-OK - with optical guidance. * Kh-55SM (NATO 'Kent-B', RKV-500B, Izdeliye 121) - with extra fuel tanks to extend range to 3000 km. * Kh-101/102 (Izdeliye 111) - developed as a very stealthy replacement for the Kh-55SM in the late 1990s, the Kh-101 has a conventional warhead and the Kh-102 is thermonuclear. This missile weighs some 2,200 - 2,400 kg, the weight of warhead is 400‚Äì450 kg. According to reports, the Kh-101 has a maximum range of 4500‚Äì5500 km and a variable flight profile at altitudes ranging from 30 ‚Äì 70 m to 6000 m, a cruising speed of 190‚Äì200 m/s and a maximum speed of 250‚Äì270 m/s. The missile is equipped with an electro-optical system for correcting the flight trajectory and with a TV guidance system for terminal guidance. Its official range is 4,500 km or 3,000 km with a conventional payload. It is re- targetable. The missiles are expected to be accurate within 10‚Äì20 m CEP. They are expected to be in service in required numbers by 2023. The new missile complex has been successfully tested and in recent years put into series production to equip modernized Tu-160 and Tu-95MSM bombers. * Kh-65SE - tactical version announced in 1992 with 410 kg conventional warhead and restricted to the 600 km range limit of the INF treaty. * Kh-55/65SD (—Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ Srednei Dalnosti - 'Medium Range') - 300 km range conventional version announced in 1995, possibly for export. Shared components with the Kh-101, range reportedly increased to 600 km with a high-altitude approach, but the Kh-SD was apparently shelved in 2001. An alternative active radar seeker was proposed for anti-shipping use. * Kh-555 (NATO 'Kent-C', Kh-55SE, Kh-55Sh) \\\\- conventionally armed version with an improved guidance system and warhead.

It was established in 2001 on the initiative of the youth group Rebel and the youth network of the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten). Currently, Socialist Youth Front often cooperates with the Red-Green Alliance, and around 80 percent of SUF members are also members of the Red-Green Alliance, though SUF itself retains an extraparliamentary focus. Socialist Youth Front is a uniting organisation for the left-wing radical youth, and it consists of many ideological persuasions, ranging from Leninists, democratic socialists to anarchists. The politics and doctrine of SUF is, however, based on an anti-parliamentarian, revolutionary, and Marxist world view. The organization publishes the external magazine Avanti, as well as the internal newsletter Blomster og Barrikader (\\"Flowers and Barricades\\").

Similar rules apply for the name of the mother party Venstre. In Danish, Venstres Ungdom is usually referred to simply as \\"VU\\". (literally: Youth of the Left) is the youth wing of the Danish Liberal Party Venstre. History The first branch of Venstres Ungdom was founded in Kolding in 1908, and the nationwide organization was established in 1912. This makes the youth wing older than the mother party, Venstre, which was established in its current form in 1910. When Venstres Ungdom was founded, Denmark had a bicameral parliament, and suffrage to one of the houses (Landstinget) was reserved for men no younger than 35. Consequently, Venstres Ungdom was intended as an organization for Liberals younger than 35. When turning 35, a member became entitled to transfer his membership to the \\"real\\" political party Venstre. When Landstinget was abolished in 1953 this distinction became irrelevant, and members are now free to choose if they wish to belong to Venstres Ungdom, Venstre or both organizations. Most members transfer their membership from Venstres Ungdom to Venstre when they approach the age of 30. Venstres Ungdom today Venstres Ungdom is one of the largest political youth organization in Denmark. As of 31 December 2009, it had 1,730 members. Members play a major role in the election campaigns of Venstre. Other activities include organizing seminars and debates. The nationwide organization has a committee corresponding to each cabinet department headed by a Venstre politician. These committees hold regular meetings with the relevant cabinet ministers. A VU spokesman is elected to represent the organization for each major area. As of January 2006, the number of spokesmen is fourteen.

The most important part of the organization is the local branches. Each branch is represented by one representative in the National Board (Landsstyrelsen). The remaining nine members, including both Chairman and Deputy Chairman, are elected by the annual National Congress. It is an important aspect of VU ideology, that the national organization is organized bottom-up. All offices are elected with a term of office of one year. The combination of these characteristics makes Venstres Ungdom unique among the Danish political youth organizations. The organization of the more recent Youth of the Socialist Peoples Party and Socialist Youth Front shows some similarities to the VU organization.

Trivia A traditional way of recognizing a resigning member's work for the organisation is by electing the person in question to the office of second deputy auditor (). This election takes place on all levels of the organization as part of the annual general meeting, along with the more serious elections of two auditors and a (first) deputy auditor. Unlike the first three mentioned, the second deputy auditor is a purely honorary title. This tradition dates from the founding of the first VU branch in Kolding in 1908, when the newly elected second deputy auditor was informed by his high school principal that if he did not relinquish this new office immediately, he would be expelled from his school since it would be futile to attempt combining academic pursuits with a political career. Since the student's office carried virtually no obligations, VU history records this as the first clear case of harassment against the organization. Since then the unfortunate student's title has been used for honorary purposes. Literature * Holst, Carl (1996), Drevet af ideen - historier om Venstres Ungdom.

History The builders had proposed a transparent glass building but ran into opposition from the historic Old South Meeting House.Boston.com / Beyond The Big Dig / News When the building was completed, it had a hard time finding tenants due to an office space glut and stood vacanthttp://houston.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/boston/content/printable.html?story_id=886620 upon completion.http://boston.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/boston/content/story.html?id=917749&t;=email_story By 2005, 56% of the office space was rentedhttp://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/boston/content/story.html?story_id=1041120 and the average rent on a monthly parking space was $350.http://www.gvaboston.com/images/BMO%202005.pdf In March 2010, 33 Arch Street was awarded the LEED Gold designation from the U.S. Green Building Council. In November 2010, the building was selected as BOMA's 2010-2011 Outstanding Building of the Year in the 500,000-1 Million Square Feet category. Design and features The building has views of Boston Common, the Charles River, City Hall Plaza, and Boston Harbor. 33 Arch Street offers over 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) of office space and has 850 parking spaces in its underground parking garage. Architecture The building has a unique wing shape to maximize the use of its tight footprint. The building strikes a balance with its surroundings and neighboring buildings through the use of the granite stone facade used to add to continuity of the urban streetscape. Yet, it is distinct from its neighbors by the extensive use of metal and glass in its exterior. The building facade features grey granite, glass and aluminum cladding. Twenty floors cantilever over adjacent retail space and a garage, which is connected to parking on the first six levels. The roof has a distinctive top that sets it apart from nearby flat roofs in the skyline. It features a curved penthouse and roof fins. The building uses four levels of external bracing transfer the enormous loads of the high building into the small base. The bracing continues through the parking levels to the foundation; perimeter and internal moment frames act as the lateral system above the braced levels. The building was the first to be built in downtown Boston under new Safety Guidelines-Subpart R for steel.

Established in 2001, the group campaigned on behalf of local communities in Wales, particularly (but not exclusively) Welsh-speaking and rural ones, which it perceived to be under threat due to demographic change. They protested against the Welsh train company Arriva Trains Wales for the lack of use of the Welsh language on its services, and the holiday agents Thomas Cook for banning the use of Welsh in its Bangor branch in 2007. Critics argued that estate agents were providing a commercial service to the Welsh people who contracted them to sell or rent their property in return for market value and that the sharp rise in the cost of property in recent years was not confined to Wales but an international phenomenon of the growing world economy, however Cymuned argued that there was a need to create a secondary sustainable local housing market in rural Wales. A new campaign designed to ensure that a sustainable proportion of new homes should be for locals only is based on planning policy that had already been adopted in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, as well as parts of Shropshire, Devon, the Peak District and the Lake District. Cymuned also campaigned on behalf of the Rhostyllen community near Wrexham against plans by the National Trust to develop land next to the village for high-priced housing. The chief executive of Cymuned was Aran Jones, who had learnt Welsh as a second language. Other notable members included the poet and musician, Twm Morys (who won the chair at the 2003 national eisteddfod), Dr Simon Brooks, former editor of the Welsh language current affairs magazine Barn, Judith Humphreys, a Welsh actress and Dr Jerry Hunter, an American Harvard graduate who moved to Wales to learn Welsh and has remained in Wales ever since, working in academic posts at the University of Wales.

Flatwoods are an ecosystem maintained by wildfire or prescribed fire and are dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and slash pine (Pinus elliotii) in the tree canopy and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), gallberry (Ilex glabra) and other flammable evergreen shrubs in the understory, along with a high diversity of herb species.Platt, W.J. 1999.

In: Hermann, S.M. (ed.) The longleaf pine ecosystem: ecology, restoration and management, pp. 45-81. It was once one of the dominant ecosystem types of southeastern North America. Although grasses and pines are characteristic of this system, the precise composition changes from west to east, that is, from Texas to Florida. In Louisiana, savannas even differ between the east and west side of the Mississippi River. The key factor maintaining this habitat type is recurring fire. Without fire, the habitat is eventually invaded by other species of woody plants. Flatwood with flowering pitcher plants in foreground A number of rare and endangered animals are typical of this habitat including red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus), frosted flatwoods salamanders (Ambystoma cingulatum), and striped newts (Notophthalmus perstriatus). Many rare and usual herbaceous plants are found here, particularly orchids (e.g. Calopogon species, Pogonia ophioglossoides), sedges (e.g. Rhynchospora species) and carnivorous plants (e.g. Sarracenia species).Keddy, P.A., L. Smith, D.R. Campbell, M. Clark and G. Montz. 2006. Patterns of herbaceous plant diversity in southeastern Louisiana pine savannas. Applied Vegetation Science 9:17-26. A second key factor is moisture. Overall, wet pine savannas have more species than pine savannas, and the distribution of each species within a savanna is intimately connected with soil moisture regimes. Temporary ponds, and seepage areas, are therefore a critical control on plant species composition. Orchids and pitcher plants, for example, are associated with wetter locations.Wet Flatwoods in Florida Accessed 21 May 2012 But even these wetter locations burn during dry periods, allowing regeneration of species of pitcher plantBarker, N.G. & Williamson, G.B. 1988.

Effects of competition and litter on a carnivorous plant, Drosera capillaris (Droseraceae). Am. J. Bot. 85: 1592-1596. Pineywoods are characterized by low basal area and large widely spaced mature pine. Historically, the flatwoods were dominated by longleaf pine, which can live to be 500 years old. Large scale overharvesting in conjunction with detrimental silvicultural practices like replacement with faster growing loblolly pine has drastically reduced the range of the longleaf pine ecosystem. Longleaf requires frequent fires, ideally every 1‚Äì3 years, which prevent invasion of the habitat by other tree species. Decades of fire exclusion in the Southeast have contributed to the decline of this community type. However, with the restoration of fire, and natural flooding regimes, it is possible to restore small areas of habitat.Keddy, P.A. 2009. Thinking big: a conservation vision for the southeastern coastal plain of North America. Southeastern Naturalist 8: 213-226.

An unusual 90 ft (27 m) tall glass-roofed lobby, known as the atrium, occupies the first two stories. The remaining stories are offices, home to a number of law firms, Certified Public Accountants, and financial services companies. The building is located on a historic 1.23-acre (5000 m¬≤) triangular piece of land next to South Station and the Federal Reserve Bank Building, joining the Fort Point Channel area with Boston's Financial District. During the Big Dig (a project to create a new underground highway under the centre of Boston), extra care was needed to avoid subsidence of the soil under the building, as construction was underway just 25 ft (7.6 m) from the building's foundation. The building was constructed on soil rather than bedrock due to the geography of the site. The tower is topped off by two radio masts. Including its radio masts, One Financial Center is the 4th-tallest building in Boston (when measuring by pinnacle height), rising 683 feet (208 meters).

In Search of New Jawbones. Living Waters Publications. , . Google Books. Retrieved 10 July 2013. Comfort started Living Waters Publications, as well as the ministry The Way of the Master, in Bellflower, California, and has written several books. Early life According to Comfort's autobiography, his parents put \\"Methodist\\" on his birth certificate but he was given no religious instruction as a child. Comfort identifies himself as both Christian and Jewish. Career In 1989, Comfort accepted an invitation to join the pastoral staff at the non-denominational Calvary Chapel in Southern California. The Way of the Master ministry In the mid-1990s Comfort persuaded Kirk Cameron, star of the cancelled hit sitcom Growing Pains, to become an evangelist. In 2002, the pair formed an organization called The Way of the Master, with the intention of teaching the church to more effectively preach the message of evangelical Christianity. Comfort says that evangelism is the main reason the Christian Church exists and that many of the evangelistic methods used over the last century have produced false conversions to Christianity. Comfort often uses the Ten Commandments to speak about sin before presenting the gospel of Jesus. In the mid-1980s he formulated two sermons entitled \\"Hell's Best Kept Secret\\" and \\"True and False Conversions.\\" Comfort speaks professionally at churches and evangelism seminars, and preaches in Huntington Beach, California. As well as co-hosting the former The Way of the Master Radio with Kirk Cameron, he is co-host of The Way of the Master Television Show. An inedible wild banana, cut to expose its many seeds In 2006, Comfort recorded a segment for The Way of the Master's television show in which he argued that the banana was \\"the atheist's nightmare\\", arguing that it displayed many user-friendly features that were evidence of intelligent design. Comfort retracted the video and claims upon learning that the banana is a result of artificial selection by humans, and that the wild banana is small and unpalatable. Debates Comfort, seated behind Kirk Cameron, at a debate on the existence of God at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan, 5 May 2007 On 13 April 2001, Comfort appeared at the 27th National Convention of American Atheists in Orlando, Florida, where he debated Ron Barrier, the National Spokesperson for American Atheists. Comfort later stated that \\"they laughed at my humor, and although there was unified mockery at some of the things that I said, I was able to go through the Ten Commandments, the fact of Judgment Day, the reality of Hell, the Cross, and the necessity of repentance, and no one stopped me.\\" On 5 May 2007, Comfort and Cameron participated in a televised debate with Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Connor of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan. The debate focused on the existence of God, which Comfort claimed he could prove scientifically without relying on the Bible. However during the debate, Cameron and Comfort repeatedly referenced the Ten Commandments and denied the theory of evolution. Nightline correspondent Martin Bashir moderated the 2007 event. In February 2009, Comfort challenged evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to a debate, offering to donate $10,000 to him. Dawkins, who had previously stated a general policy not to debate with creationists, said he would agree to do it if Comfort made a $100,000 donation to the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science non-profit organization. Comfort raised his offer to $20,000, which according to biologist PZ Myers was \\"not enough\\". Publications Tracts Gospel tracts produced by Ray Comfort's ministry, Living Waters According to Comfort, he has designed dozens of gospel tracts since the 1970s, and sells millions of Living Waters tracts each year. Some of his tracts are designed to resemble paper money, including fake $100, $1,000 and $1 million bills. Others employ novelties intended to amuse, such as a \\"ticket to heaven\\" that invites the reader to tear it if they do not need it; the ticket is printed on a type of plastic, making it difficult to rip. The tracts typically attempt to persuade the reader that on judgment day, they will certainly be found guilty of breaking one or more of the Ten Commandments, and therefore will be sent to hell, unless they say a prayer to acknowledge Christ's substitutionary atonement. In June 2006, agents of the US Secret Service confiscated thousands of Ray Comfort's \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" gospel tracts from Darrel Rundus, president of Great News Network. A federal district court judge ruled that the tracts, which were marked as \\"not legal tender\\", did not violate federal law and ordered their return. In October 2010, The New Zealand Herald reported that elderly people received \\"appointment cards\\" by Comfort's California-based publishing company, Living Waters, asking them to fill out information regarding the date and time of their deaths, and advising them to contact evangelists in order to avoid hell. Recipients of these cards expressed anger and horror over receiving them, and contacted police over the matter, with one of them commenting, \\"It's disgusting. It was quite spooky. I just couldn't comprehend why anyone would ask you to predict the date of your death.\\" The New Zealand Herald summarized a statement from Living Waters spokesperson Lisa Law as saying that \\"the cards were a way of raising awareness of human mortality in order to spark discussion about Jesus\\", and that Law \\"did not know who sent [the tracts]\\".  Books  Ray Comfort has authored more than 80 books and tracts. His 2009 book You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence, But You Can't Make Him Think, ranked #1 in Amazon.com's atheism and apologetics categories when it debuted in February 2009.  Abridged version of On the Origin of Species  In November 2009, Comfort released an edited and abridged version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, with a 50-page foreword contaning creationist arguments against the theory of evolution. via Archive.org The book was given away for free at selected schools around the United States. Stan Guffey, a biologist at the University of Tennessee, alleged that most of Comfort's foreword was plagiarised from Darwin himself. According to Comfort's website, \\"nothing has been removed from Darwin's original work\\", but Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), noted that Comfort deleted four chapters by Darwin that described the evidence for evolution, adding that two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcased biogeography, some of Darwin's strongest evidence for evolution. She wrote that Comfort's foreword is \\"a hopeless mess of long-ago- refuted creationist arguments, teeming with misinformation about the science of evolution, populated by legions of strawmen, and exhibiting what can be charitably described as muddled thinking\\". On his website, Comfort said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted in order to make the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, and that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The NCSE arranged a campaign at colleges across the US to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction, a one-page flier, and \\"the NCSE Safety Bookmark\\" in the shape of a banana, a reference to Comfort's flawed presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God. List of books published      Film  Ray Comfort open-air preaching at a Great News Network evangelism boot camp in 2004 In 2011, Comfort wrote and produced a 33-minute documentary film called 180: Changing the Heart of a Nation. The film was criticized by The Huffington Post for its comparison of legalized abortion to the Holocaust. Comfort's 2016 film The Atheist Delusion premiered at the Ark Encounter, a Christian theme park operated by the young Earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis on 22 October 2016.

Its primary function is to provide automated configuration and maintenance of large-scale computer systems, including the unified management of servers, desktops, consumer and industrial devices, embedded networked devices, mobile smartphones, and tablet computers.  History   CFEngine 1  The CFEngine project began in 1993 as a way for author Mark Burgess (then a post-doctoral fellow of the Royal Society at Oslo University, Norway) to get his work done by automating the management of a small group of workstations in the Department of Theoretical Physics. Like many post-docs and PhD students, Burgess ended up with the task of managing Unix workstations, scripting and fixing problems for users manually. Scripting took too much time, the flavours of Unix were significantly different, and scripts had to be maintained for multiple platforms, drowning in exception logic. After discussing the problems with a colleague, Burgess wrote the first version of CFEngine (the configuration engine) which was published as an internal report and presented at the CERN computing conference. It gained significant attention from a wider community because it was able to hide platform differences using a domain-specific language. A year later, Burgess finished his post-doc but decided to stay in Oslo and took a job lecturing at Oslo University College. Here he realized that there was little or no research being done into configuration management, and he set about applying the principles of scientific modelling to understanding computer systems. In a short space of time, he developed the notion of convergent operators, which remains a core of CFEngine.  CFEngine 2  In 1998 Burgess wrote \\"Computer Immunology\\", a paper at the USENIX/LISA98 conference. It laid out a manifesto for creating self-healing systems, reiterated a few years later by IBM in their form of Autonomic Computing. This started a research effort which led to a major re-write, CFEngine 2, which added features for machine learning, anomaly detection and secure communications.  CFEngine 3  Between 1998 and 2004, CFEngine grew in adoption along with the popularity of Linux as a computing platform. During this time, Mark Burgess developed promise theory, a model of distributed cooperation for self-healing automation. In 2008, after more than five years of research, CFEngine 3 was introduced, which incorporated promise theory as \\"a way to make CFEngine both simpler and more powerful at the same time\\", according to Burgess. The most significant re- write of the project to date, CFEngine 3 also integrated knowledge management and discovery mechanisms‚Äîallowing configuration management to scale to automate enterprise-class infrastructure. Commercialization In June 2008 the company CFEngine AS was formed as a collaboration between author Mark Burgess, Oslo University College and the Oslo Innovation Centre in order to support users of CFEngine. In April 2009, the company launched the first commercial version of CFEngine - CFEngine Enterprise. The Enterprise version can be downloaded for free for up to 25 agents (clients). February 2011, the company received its first round of funding, from FERD Capital. The company has offices in Oslo, Norway and Mountain View, California, USA. In 2017, the company changed its name to Northern.tech, to reflect that it is working on multiple software products, not only CFEngine. Characteristics  Portability  CFEngine provides an operating system-independent interface to Unix-like host configuration. It requires some expert knowledge to deal with peculiarities of different operating systems, but has the power to perform maintenance actions across multiple hosts. CFEngine can be used on Windows hosts as well, and is widely used for managing large numbers of Unix hosts that run heterogeneous operating systems, e.g. Solaris, Linux, AIX, Tru64 and HP-UX. Research-based Shortly after its inception, CFEngine inspired a field of research into automated configuration management. The CFEngine project claims to attempt to place the problem of configuration management in a scientific framework. Its author Mark Burgess has developed a range of theoretical tools and results to talk about the problem, and has written several text books and monographs explaining them. Convergence One of the main ideas in CFEngine is that changes in computer configuration should be carried out in a convergent manner. This means that each change operation made by the agent should have the character of a fixed point. Rather than describing the steps needed to make a change, CFEngine language describes the final state in which one wants to end up. The agent then ensures that the necessary steps are taken to end up in this \\"policy compliant state\\". Thus, CFEngine can be run again and again, whatever the initial state of a system, and it will end up with a predictable result. CFEngine supports the item of statistical compliance with policy, meaning that a system can never guarantee to be exactly in an ideal or desired state, rather one approaches (converges) towards the desired state by best-effort, at a rate that is determined by the ratio of the frequency of environmental change to the rate of CFEngine execution. User base CFEngine is used in both large and small companies, as well as in many universities and governmental institutions. The largest reported datacenter under management of CFEngine is above a million servers, while sites as large as 40,000 machines are publicly reported (LinkedIn), while sites of several thousand hosts running under CFEngine are common. According to statistics from CFEngine AS, probably several million computers run CFEngine around the world, and users from more than 100 countries have been registered.

A related result is that a quadratic space over a number field is isotropic if and only if it is isotropic locally everywhere, or equivalently, that a quadratic form over a number field nontrivially represents zero if and only if this holds for all completions of the field. The theorem was proved in the case of the field of rational numbers by Hermann Minkowski and generalized to number fields by Helmut Hasse. The same statement holds even more generally for all global fields. Importance The importance of the Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem lies in the novel paradigm it presented for answering arithmetical questions: in order to determine whether an equation of a certain type has a solution in rational numbers, it is sufficient to test whether it has solutions over complete fields of real and p-adic numbers, where analytic considerations, such as Newton's method and its p-adic analogue, Hensel's lemma, apply. This is encapsulated in the idea of a local-global principle, which is one of the most fundamental techniques in arithmetic geometry.  Application to the classification of quadratic forms  The Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem reduces the problem of classifying quadratic forms over a number field K up to equivalence to the set of analogous but much simpler questions over local fields. Basic invariants of a nonsingular quadratic form are its dimension, which is a positive integer, and its discriminant modulo the squares in K, which is an element of the multiplicative group K*/K*2. In addition, for every place v of K, there is an invariant coming from the completion Kv. Depending on the choice of v, this completion may be the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, or a p-adic number field, each of which has different kinds of invariants: * Case of R. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the signature (or, alternatively, the negative index of inertia) is a complete invariant. * Case of C. All nonsingular quadratic forms of the same dimension are equivalent. * Case of Qp and its algebraic extensions. Forms of the same dimension are classified up to equivalence by their Hasse invariant. These invariants must satisfy some compatibility conditions: a parity relation (the sign of the discriminant must match the negative index of inertia) and a product formula (a local‚Äìglobal relation). Conversely, for every set of invariants satisfying these relations, there is a quadratic form over K with these invariants.

Historically, a billet was a private dwelling that was required to accept the soldier. Soldiers are generally billeted in barracks or garrisons when not on combat duty, although in some armies soldiers with families are permitted to maintain a home off-post. Used for a building, the term billet is more commonly used in British English; United States standard terms are quarters, barracks, Single (Soldier) Housing or Family Housing. British history Originally, a \\"billet\\" (from the French) was a note, commonly used in the 18th and early 19th centuries as a \\"billet of invitation.\\" In this sense, the term was used to denote an order issued to a soldier entitling him to quarters with a certain person. From this meaning, the word billet came to be loosely used of the quarters thus obtained. Repeated petitions against the practice of billeting, starting in the 16th century, culminated in its outlawing in 1689 as an extension of a section of the Petition of Right 1628. During wartime, civilians who have been evacuated from a city in danger of attack are billetted in communal shelters or in the homes of individuals. The practice of billeting evacuees was widespread in Britain during World War II, particularly during the Blitz when children and other non-essential persons in major cities were sent to rural areas for safety. In European countries since the formation of regular forces, the Quartermaster was an occupation and a rank of the individuals responsible for the provision of sleeping quarters and other provisions for regular time troops. United States usage One of the major grievances of the American colonists against the British government which led to the American Revolutionary War was the quartering of soldiers in civilian homes. As a result, the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution provides restrictions on the manner in which the Federal government of the United States may require civilians to provide housing for American soldiers. Billet can mean a specific personnel position, assignment, or duty station which may be filled by one person, most commonly used by the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Coast Guard.Cutler and Cutler, p 26 Every person reporting aboard a ship or shore installation in the naval services is assigned a billet according to the unit watch, quarter and station bill, which shows the duties, stations and billet assignments for all crew members.Cutler and Cutler, p 238 Billet can also refer to the position and weapons of the members of a unit. For example, the billets of a fireteam include a fireteam leader (M16), a rifleman (M16), an automatic rifleman (M249), and a grenadier (M16 with M203 grenade launcher). Amateur sports In North America, billet families offer room and board to junior ice hockey players (or Under-20 athletes from other sports, such as soccer) who leave home to join elite teams in other towns. Coaches are often involved with matching a player to a billet family. The objective of a billet family is to provide a \\"home away from home\\" for young players during the season. However, exaggerated fears over child safety in amateur sports in Canada drastically curtailed billeting practice. Many places do not billet, while other clubs through their provincial sports' bodies have instituted mandatory criminal record checks for all involved in amateur sports, including coaches, volunteers and anyone over eighteen years of age from the host family. Other usage *In Spain, the noble officers of royal tercios were billeted in the homes of the affluent and well-to-do citizens of the towns and cities they were stationed in. This usage is employed as a plot device in the Barber of Seville. *In Canada, the term is widely used in conjunction with housing visiting performers from theatrical or musical tours, such as for a Fringe Theatre festival or a choir festival. Students traveling for a band or choir tour may billet with members of the host band or choir. *The expression \\"billet\\" is also used for an exchange student.

The show aired weekends, usually on Sunday nights, and originated from WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., one of NBC's owned and operated stations. Most of the stations that aired The Sports Machine were NBC affiliates. The show was an offshoot of a local program that George Michael, a former disc jockey who became a sportscaster, hosted in Washington beginning in 1980. Michael hosted the program for its entire run, which ended in 2007. Lindsay Czarniak, who was a colleague of Michael's at WRC-TV, joined the program as a substitute host in 2004 and became Michael's co-host in 2006. History 1984‚Äì2004 Shortly after Michael joined WRC-TV in 1980, the station launched the program as George Michael's Sports Final, a local sports wrapup show on Sunday evenings, following the late newscast. After a successful four-year run in Washington, NBC's other owned-and-operated stations‚Äîat the time in New York City, Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Chicago‚Äîadded the program to their Sunday late-night schedules, and it was retitled as The George Michael Sports Machine. NBC concurrently began to offer the program to its affiliated stations as part of the network schedule on September 2, 1984; WRC-TV, which continued to produce Sports Machine, said that this was the first time that a network had carried a locally-produced sports show. In 1991, ITC Entertainment took Sports Machine into wider national syndication; at the time, the program was carried on 84 of NBC's affiliates. The show moved to Group W Productions in 1995; its successors, Eyemark Entertainment and King World Productions (both now CBS Television Distribution), continued to distribute Sports Machine until 2001, when NBC Enterprises (later NBCUniversal Television Distribution from 2004 until the show's final episode in 2007) began distributing the program. As host, George Michael presented clips from the weekend's sporting events from across the United States and sometimes outside of the U.S. Unlike newer sports-related programming, Sports Machine did not usually present commentary or criticism and focused almost purely on the highlights, and, often toward the end of the show, an in-depth story about a particular athlete. The show was also somewhat unusual in its occasional coverage of remarkable high school sports footage, and its occasional coverage of sports largely ignored by most other sports wrap-up shows, such as ice hockey, NASCAR and other auto racing events, professional wrestling, rodeo, and equestrian events. Influence and criticism When the show premiered nationally in the mid-1980s, the only highlights available to sports fans on Sunday nights were those on late local newscasts and the ESPN and CNN cable networks, creating an audience niche for Sports Machine to fill. By the later years of Sports Machine, however, the rise of numerous specialty cable sports channels (notably ESPNews) and the expansion of Sunday evening local newscasts to either air an extended sportscast (an extra in common parlance) or a separate program to recap Sunday football and baseball action caused many stations to either drop the program or air it later in the night‚Äîissues made even worse in 2006, when NBC acquired the rights to Sunday Night Football, which in turn pushed late local news on most of the Sports Machine's affiliates even later. An idiosyncrasy of the show was the large quantity of REAL machinery on its set. After introducing each of the highlights, Michael would press a button which \\"activated\\" the \\"sports machine\\"‚Äîa large computer with several monitors attached to a videotape reel-to-reel‚Äîto play the clips. Michael and the producers chose the computer motif mainly because high technology was fast coming into the American consciousness at the time of the show's debut. The show magnified highlights in order to take out the distraction of the digital on-screen graphics added by the networks during the 1990s. Cancellation Beginning in 2004, fellow WRC-TV sports anchor Lindsay Czarniak joined Sports Machine as a contributing correspondent and substitute host, and she became the official co-host of the program in September 2006. However, this arrangement did not last long, as Michael announced on November 16, 2006 that he would retire and Sports Machine would end its 27-year run in March 2007. Michael reasoned that he would not want his contract renewed at the expense of WRC-TV's sports staff, which was slated to be reduced under NBC Universal's network-wide, cost-reduction initiative. The last episode aired on March 25, 2007. After thanking his co-host, sponsors, syndicators and staff, Michael said this at the end of the show: > I close every show every Sunday by saying, \\"Thank you for letting us be a > part of your weekend.\\" Well, tonight, for the final time, we say, \\"thank > you.\\" Thank you for letting us be a part of your life. From everyone at the > Sports Machine, have a great weekend, everybody. We hope to see you > somewhere down the road of life. Thank you. Michael then walked off camera, and was heard to say \\"Last one out, turn out the lights!\\" as the show closed for the final time. The end of Sports Machine coincided with the end of Michael's contract as lead sports anchor at WRC, and he was replaced by Czarniak in that role. Michael continued to appear on sports panel shows and Washington Redskins-related programs for WRC-TV and Washington-area sports talk radio stations until more production and budget cuts forced those shows to be terminated. Michael died from leukemia on December 24, 2009. Shortly after the end of the Sports Machine, Czarniak became a permanent part of TNT's NASCAR broadcasts as a pit reporter in addition to her duties at WRC. She left that position after the 2011 season. In 2011, Czarniak left WRC to take a position at ESPN and initially was an overnight anchor at ESPNews before becoming a fixture on SportsCenter, where she anchored the 6 PM broadcast with John Anderson from December 3, 2012 to January 30, 2015 and later, was the sole anchor from February 2, 2015 to mid- October 2016. In August 2017, her contract with ESPN expired. References and notes * John Maynard (2006-11-17). George Michael to drop anchor chores, continue weekend sports panel shows. The Washington Post.

The men were Steven F. Hyde, the CEO of Trump's casino operations, Mark Grossinger Etess, the president and chief operating officer of the Taj Mahal, and Trump Plaza executive vice president Jonathan Benanav.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/nyregion/copter-crash- kills-3-aides-of-trump.html?mcubz=0 In 1995, Trump established Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (THCR) as a publicly traded company, granting it ownership of the Trump Plaza and the under-development Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana. The following year, THCR bought the Trump Taj Mahal at a valuation of $890 million, and bought the Trump Castle from Trump for $486 million (including $355 million in assumed debt). In 1996, the company opened Trump World's Fair, a casino adjunct to the Trump Plaza. The World's Fair was closed in 1999, with plans to replace it with a larger resort. In 1997, THCR was one of eleven applicants for three casino licenses available in Detroit, with a $542-million proposal for the Trump Motor City Hotel Casino, in partnership with Mel Farr. The bid was ultimately dropped from consideration because of Mayor Dennis Archer's doubts about the company's financial condition. In 1998, THCR business consultants spent at least $68,000 on a trip to Cuba in violation to the United States embargo against Cuba. According to a report by Newsweek, the consulting firm Seven Arrows Investment and Development instructed THCR on how to evade the embargo by linking the money to a charitable effort. In 1999, THCR agreed to purchase the Flamingo Hilton Casino Kansas City for $15 million, but the deal fell through when Missouri gaming regulators did not approve the company's gaming license by a contractual deadline. THCR entered a management agreement in 2000 to operate the Spotlight 29 Casino, an Indian casino in Coachella, California. Financial troubles Trump Entertainment Resorts and its predecessors have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection four times, in 1991, following construction of the $1-billion Trump Taj Mahal, and in 2004, 2009 and 2014. In 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts explored various options for restructuring its debt, amid speculation that it might file for bankruptcy. A possible arrangement with Credit Suisse First Boston was not completed because the bondholders rejected it. On October 21, 2004, the company announced a preliminary agreement with its investors. Trump, who had been the majority owner, would reduce his stock ownership from 56 to 27 percent. Bondholders would surrender some of their debt in exchange for stock. On October 27, the company announced that Morgan Stanley would be the joint lead arranger for a $500 million financing as part of the restructuring plan. On November 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Trump said the filing was \\"really just a technical thing\\" as the best way to implement the restructuring plan. The plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court on December 16, 2004. After the 2004 bankruptcy, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts (TER). In 2005, the company's involvement in the Spotlight 29 Casino ended, as the tribe bought out the casino management agreement for $6 million. Later that year, TER sold its Indiana casino to The Majestic Star Casino, LLC for $253 million. The company had also been awarded a license to build a second casino in Orange County, Indiana, but dropped this plan, due in part to the state's concerns about the company's viability. In 2007, the company attempted to negotiate a buyout with several public and private firms, but on July 2, it announced that it could not reach a deal, and would take itself off the market. The company planned to lay off employees in order to cut costs. 2009 bankruptcy and restructuring The casino group filed for bankruptcy again in February 2009,Love, Zach, Bankruptcy Roundup: Trump Dumps Casinos, Fortunoff Gets Sued, and Peanut Corp. Goes Under, Law.Com, Feb. 17, 2009 owing $1.2 billion. Two sets of debt holders eventually proposed reorganization plans for the group in U.S. bankruptcy court. Trump initially made an agreement with banker and poker player Andrew Beal, owner of Beal Bank, which held $500 million in the group's debt, to take over the resorts. However, citing concerns about the bank's lack of gaming experience, he dropped them in favor of hedge fund Avenue Capital Management, a plan favored by other bondholders. Beal then partnered with investor, Carl Icahn, who had worked on restructuring another Atlantic City casino, the Tropicana.Grant, Peter, Icahn Leaps Into Trump Casino Battle, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 14, 2009 In court, Trump argued that he would fight the Icahn/Beal team if they sought to use his name and likeness on the group's properties.Church, Steven, Trump Argues Name Can't Be Used By Icahn for Casinos (Update4), Bloomberg, February 23, 2010 Instead he signed an agreement with Avenue Capital in which he would receive 5% stock in the reorganized company and another 5% in exchange for the use of his name and likeness in perpetuity.

The proceeds would be used to pay down the company's debt to a level of $270 million. CEO Robert Griffin said TER would consider also selling the Trump Taj Mahal for the right price. However, Carl Icahn, who held the mortgage on the Trump casinos, would reject the sale of the Trump Plaza. In early August 2014, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit demanding removal of his name from the company's two casinos, because they had allegedly been allowed to fall into disrepair, in breach of the licensing agreement for Trump's name. 2014 bankruptcy In September 2014, Trump Entertainment Resorts filed again for bankruptcy, and closed the Trump Plaza. On a motion made by union UNITE HERE Local 54,http://www.esquireglobalcrossings.com/files/2016/01/Trump-Entertainment- Resorts.pdf relating to the bankruptcy action, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in Trump Entertainment's favor on January 15, 2016 and held that Trump Entertainment could reject the continuing terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement with the union, an agreement that had already expired by its terms. This case was significant as it was a matter of First impression among the courts of appeal and could significantly alter the balance of power between debtor-employers and their unions.

The Plaza has been liquidated of its assets in rumor of implosion. On December 14, 2018, the demolition deadline officially passed, meaning Trump Plaza will remain standing through the winter. In late December 2018, Carl Icahn, the owner of Icahn Enterprises which owns Trump Entertainment Resorts, terminated the deed restriction on the property, and bought out a complicated lease. This is important as it makes a sale much more attractive.

Egil's Saga historically narrates a period from approximately 850 to 1000 CE and is believed to have been written between 1220 and 1240 CE. Life Egill engaging in holmgang with Berg-√ñnundr; painting by Johannes Flintoe Egill is born in Iceland, to Skalla-Gr√≠mr Kveld√∫lfssonSkalla- refers to his baldness and Gr√≠mr was a frequent name, being one of the names of √ì√∞inn, but also being a heiti for snake, billy-goat and dwarf and Bera Yngvarsd√≥ttir; he is the grandson of Kveld-√ölfr (whose name means \\"evening Wolf\\"). Another of his ancestors, Hallbj√∂rn, is Norwegian-Sami. Skalla-Gr√≠mr is a respected chieftain, and mortal enemy of King Harald Fairhair of Norway. He migrates to Iceland, settling at Borg, the place where his father's coffin lands. Egill composes his first poem at the age of three years. He exhibits berserk behaviour, and this, together with the description of his large and unattractive head, has led to the theory that he might have suffered from Paget's disease, which causes a thickening of the bones and may lead eventually to blindness. At the age of seven, Egill is cheated in a game with local boys. Enraged, he goes home, procures an axe, and, returning to the boys, splits the skull to the teeth of the boy who had cheated him. After Berg-√ñnundr refuses to allow Egill to claim his wife √Åsger√∞r's share of her father's inheritance, he challenged √ñnundr to a man-to-man fight on an island (a holmgangr). Berg-√ñnundr refuses the challenge but is later killed along with his brother Hadd by Egill. Egill is later to kill the last of the brothers, Atli the Short, by biting through Atli's neck during a holmgangr. Later, after being grievously insulted, Egill kills B√°r√∞r of Atley, a retainer of King Eir√≠kr Bloodaxe and kinsman of Queen Gunnhildr, both of whom spend the remainder of their lives trying to take vengeance. Seething with hatred, Gunnhildr orders her two brothers, Eyvindr Braggart and √Ålfr Aksmann, to assassinate Egill and his brother √û√≥r√≥lfr, who has been on good terms with her previously. However, Egill slays the Queen's brothers when they attempt to confront him. In spring √û√≥r√≥lfr and Egill prepare a large warship and raid along the Eastern route (Austrvegr), where they win much wealth and have many battles. In Courland they make a peace for half a month and trade with the men of the land (ch. 46). That same summer, Haraldr Fairhair dies. In order to secure his place as sole King of Norway, Eir√≠kr Bloodaxe murders his two brothers. He then declares Egill an outlaw in Norway. Berg-√ñnundr gathers a company of men to capture Egill, but is killed during his attempt to do so. Before escaping from Norway, Egill also slays R√∂gnvaldr, the son of King Eir√≠kr and Queen Gunnhildr. He then curses the King and Queen, setting a horse's head on a Nithing pole and saying :\\"Here I set up a n√≠√∞-pole, and declare this n√≠√∞ against King Eir√≠kr and Queen Gunnhildr,\\"--he turned the horse-head to face the mainland--\\"I declare this n√≠√∞ at the land-spirits there, and the land itself, so that all will fare astray, not to hold nor find their places, not until they wreak King Eir√≠kr and Gunnhildr from the land.\\" He set up the pole of n√≠√∞ in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse's eyes on the land, and he carved runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse. (ch. 57). Gunnhildr also puts a spell on Egill, cursing him to feel restless and depressed until they meet again. Soon afterwards, Eir√≠kr and Gunnhildr are forced to flee to the Kingdom of Northumbria by Prince H√°kon. In Saxon England, they become King and Queen of Northumbria in rivalry with King Athelstan of England. In time, Egill is shipwrecked in Northumbria and comes to know who rules the land. Egill seeks out the house of his good friend Arinbj√∂rn, where they arm themselves and march to Eir√≠kr's court. Arinbj√∂rn tells Egill \\"now you must go and offer the king your head and embrace his foot. I will present your case to him.\\" Arinbj√∂rn presents Egill‚Äôs case and Egill composes a short dr√°pa, reciting it with Eir√≠kr‚Äôs foot in his hand, but Eir√≠kr is not impressed. He explains that Egill‚Äôs wrongs to him were far too great to be forgiven so easily. Gunnhildr calls for the immediate execution of Egill, but Arinbj√∂rn convinces the king not to kill him until the morning. Arinbj√∂rn tells Egill that he should stay up all night and compose a mighty head-ransom poem or dr√°pa fit for such a king, a poem in praise of his enemy. In the morning Egill goes back before king Eir√≠kr and recites the great dr√°pa. This twenty-stanza long head-ransom poem appears in Chapter 63 of Egils saga. Eir√≠kr is so surprised by the quality of the poem that he decides to give Egill his life, even though Egill has killed Eir√≠kr's own son. The complex nature of these poems, with complex poetic metres and metaphors (including kennings), as well as the fact that they were often about kings reliably attested in the historical record, provides some basis for supposing that they might have been composed by a historically real Egill Skallagr√≠msson, descending more or less unchanged through oral tradition from the time of their composition to the writing of Egils saga. Egils saga and some other Icelandic sagas appear to hang on a skeletal framework of such complex poetry, a spine of historical truth. Egill also fights at the Battle of Brunanburh in the service of King √Üthelstan; his brother √û√≥r√≥lfr dies there, for which Egill receives two chests of silver from √Üthelstan in compensation.\\"Egil's Saga\\". The Sagas of Icelanders. Penguin Books, 2000. 109‚Äì119. Print. Ultimately, Egill returns to his family farm in Iceland, where he remains a force to be reckoned with in local politics. He lives into his eighties, grows blind, and dies shortly before the Christianisation of Iceland. Before Egill dies he buries his silver near Mosfellsb√¶r. In his last act of violence he kills the servants who help him bury his treasure. When a Christian chapel is constructed at the family homestead, Egill's body is exhumed by his son and re-buried near the altar. According to the saga, the exhumed skull bone was hit with an axe, and it only turned white, showing the strength of the warrior, but also, according to one modern interpretations, suggesting the traits of Paget's disease. Issue According to Egils saga, Egill has five children with √Åsger√∞r Bj√∂rnsd√≥ttir: √ûorger√∞r Egilsd√≥ttir, Bera Egilsd√≥ttir, B√∂√∞var Egilsson, Gunnar Egilsson and √ûorsteinn Egilsson. In later years, Iceland's M√Ωrar clan claimed descent from him. Poems Apart from being a warrior of immense might in literary sources, Egill is also celebrated for his poetry, considered by many historians to be the finest of the ancient Scandinavian poets and Sonatorrek, the dirge over his own sons, has been called \\"the birth of Nordic personal lyric poetry\\". His poems were also the first Old Norse verses to use end rhyme.Jansson 1980:26-27 The following works are attributed to Egill: #A√∞alsteinsdr√°pa. Dr√°pa for the Anglo-Saxon King √Üthelstan. #H√∂fu√∞lausn (\\"The Head Ransom\\", sometimes referred to as \\"Head-Ransom\\"), with which Egill bought his life from Eir√≠kr Bloodaxe, who had sentenced him to death in England. #Sonatorrek (\\"The Loss of a Son\\").

His apparent mastery of their magic powers assisted him several times during his journeys. During a feast at Atla-isle, Bard's attempt to poison Egill failed when a rune carved by Egill shattered his poisoned cup. At a companion's request, he examined a sick woman. A local land owner, after being denied her hand in marriage, had attempted to carve love-runes. Instead, he had mistakenly carved runes causing illness. Egill burned the offending runes and carved runes for health, and the woman recovered. He then sang a poem declaring that \\"Runes none should grave ever/Who knows not to read them.\\" As for the sick young woman, in addition to burning the runes, Egill ordered her to be lifted out of bed and her old bedding to be thrown away and replaced with new sheets. Recovery was swift. Runes were also employed by Egill during the raising of the Nithing Pole against King Eirik Bloodaxe and Queen Gunnhildr. Egill in popular culture * The Icelandic brewery √ñlger√∞in Egill Skallagr√≠msson is named after him. * There is a talk show on Icelandic television called Egill's Silver, named after Egill's hidden treasure. This, however, was also a double joke, since the host's first name is Egill. * \\"Egill's Silver\\" is also the name of a song by Megas, from his first album. * In the SCA Barony of Adiantum there is an \\"Egil Skallagrimsson Memorial Tournament\\" held annually on memorial day weekend. * The novelist Poul Anderson (a member of the SCA) wrote Mother of Kings,New York: Tor (, ), 2001, 2003 a historical fantasy centered on Gunnhildr and the long feud that she, Eirikr, and their children had with Egill. The novel is based on Heimskringla and Egils Saga. * \\"Egil Saga\\" is a song on the album Licht by the German band, Faun. The lyrics are taken from \\"Egils Saga\\" and tell the story of the girl made sick by the runes and how Egil cured her. Footnotes References *Jansson, Sven B. (1980). Runstenar.

Wilson himself compared his model to such a set. A unit of selection is a biological entity within the hierarchy of biological organization (for example, an entity such as: a self-replicating molecule, a gene, a cell, an organism, a group, or a species) that is subject to natural selection. There is debate among evolutionary biologists about the extent to which evolution has been shaped by selective pressures acting at these different levels.Okasha, S. (2006) Evolution and the levels of selection. Oxford University Press. There is debate over the relative importance of the units themselves. For instance, is it group or individual selection that has driven the evolution of altruism? Where altruism reduces the fitness of individuals, individual-centered explanations for the evolution of altruism become complex and rely on the use of game theory, for instance; see kin selection and group selection. There also is debate over the definition of the units themselves, and the roles for selection and replication, and whether these roles may change in the course of evolution.  Fundamental theory  Two useful introductions to the fundamental theory underlying the unit of selection issue and debate, which also present examples of multi-level selection from the entire range of the biological hierarchy (typically with entities at level N-1 competing for increased representation, i.e., higher frequency, at the immediately higher level N, e.g., organisms in populations or cell lineages in organisms), are Richard Lewontin's classic piece The Units of SelectionLewontin, Richard 1970. The Units of Selection. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 1: 1-18. and John Maynard-Smith and E√∂rs Szathm√°ry's co-authored book, The Major Transitions in Evolution. As a theoretical introduction to units of selection, Lewontin writes: > The generality of the principles of natural selection means that any > entities in nature that have variation, reproduction, and heritability may > evolve. ...the principles can be applied equally to genes, organisms, > populations, species, and at opposite ends of the scale, prebiotic molecules > and ecosystems.\\" (1970, pp. 1-2) Elisabeth Lloyd's book The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory provides a basic philosophical introduction to the debate.  Selection at each level  Below, cases of selection at the genic, cellular, individual and group level from within the multi-level selection perspective are presented and discussed.  Nucleic acid  George C. Williams in his influential book Adaptation and Natural Selection was one of the first to present a gene- centered view of evolution with the gene as the unit of selection, arguing that a unit of selection should exhibit a high degree of permanence. Richard Dawkins has written several books popularizing and expanding the idea. According to Dawkins, genes cause phenotypes and a gene is 'judged' by its phenotypic effects. Dawkins distinguishes entities which survive or fail to survive (\\"replicators\\") from entities with temporary existence that interact directly with the environment (\\"vehicles\\"). Genes are \\"replicators\\" whereas individuals and groups of individuals are \\"vehicles\\". Dawkins argues that, although they are both aspects of the same process, \\"replicators\\" rather than \\"vehicles\\" should be preferred as units of selection. This is because replicators, owing to their permanence, should be regarded as the ultimate beneficiaries of adaptations. Genes are replicators and therefore the gene is the unit of selection. Dawkins further expounded this view in an entire chapter called 'God's utility function' in the book River Out of Eden where he explained that genes alone have utility functions.See the chapter God's utility function in Some clear-cut examples of selection at the level of the gene include meiotic drive and retrotransposons. In both of these cases, gene sequences increase their relative frequency in a population without necessarily providing benefits at other levels of organization. Meiotic-drive mutations (see segregation distortion) manipulate the machinery of chromosomal segregation so that chromosomes carrying the mutation are later found in more than half of the gametes produced by individuals heterozygous for the mutation, and for this reason the frequency of the mutation increases in the population. Retrotransposons are DNA sequences that, once replicated by the cellular machinery, insert themselves in the genome more or less randomly. Such insertions can be very mutagenic and thus reduce drastically individual fitness, so that there is strong selection against elements that are very active. Meiotic-drive alleles have also been shown strongly to reduce individual fitness, clearly exemplifying the potential conflict between selection at different levels. According to the RNA world hypothesis, RNA sequences performing both enzymatic and information storage roles in autocatalytic sets were an early unit of selection and evolution that would later transition into living cells. It is possible that RNA-based evolution is still taking place today. Other subcellular entities such as viruses, both DNA-based and RNA-based, do evolve.  Epigene  There is also view that evolution is acting on epigenes.  Cell  Leo Buss in his book The Evolution of Individuality proposes that much of the evolution of development in animals reflects the conflict between selective pressures acting at the level of the cell and those acting at the level of the multicellular individual. This perspective can shed new light on phenomena as diverse as gastrulation and germ line sequestration. This selection for unconstrained proliferation is in conflict with the fitness interests of the individual, and thus there is tension between selection at the level of the cell and selection at the level of the individual. Since the proliferation of specific cells of the vertebrate immune system to fight off infecting pathogens is a case of programmed and exquisitely contained cellular proliferation, it represents a case of the individual manipulating selection at the level of the cell to enhance its own fitness. In the case of the vertebrate immune system, selection at the level of the cell and individual are not in conflict. Some view cancer stem cells as units of selection.  Behavioural  Gene‚Äìculture coevolution was developed to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.  Organism  Selection at the level of the organism can be described as Darwinism, and is well understood and considered common. If a relatively faster gazelle manages to survive and reproduce more, the causation of the higher fitness of this gazelle can be fully accounted for if one looks at how individual gazelles fare under predation. The speed of the faster gazelle could be caused by a single gene, be polygenic, or be fully environmentally determined, but the unit of selection in this case is the individual since speed is a property of each individual gazelle. When speaking about individual organism evolution an extended phenotype and superorganism must be also mentioned.  Group  If a group of organisms, owing to their interactions or division of labor, provides superior fitness compared to other groups, where the fitness of the group is higher or lower than the mean fitness of the constituent individuals, group selection can be declared to occur. Specific syndromes of selective factors can create situations in which groups are selected because they display group properties which are selected- for. Many common examples of group traits are reducible to individual traits, however. Selection of these traits is thus more simply explained as selection of individual traits. Some mosquito-transmitted rabbit viruses are only transmitted to uninfected rabbits from infected rabbits which are still alive. This creates a selective pressure on every group of viruses already infecting a rabbit not to become too virulent and kill their host rabbit before enough mosquitoes have bitten it, since otherwise all the viruses inside the dead rabbit would rot with it. And indeed in natural systems such viruses display much lower virulence levels than do mutants of the same viruses that in laboratory culture readily outcompete non-virulent variants (or than do tick- transmitted viruses since ticks do bite dead rabbits). In the previous passage, the group is assumed to have \\"lower virulence\\", i.e., \\"virulence\\" is presented as a group trait. One could argue then that the selection is in fact against individual viruses that are too virulent. In this case, however, the fitness of all viruses within a rabbit is affected by what the group does to the rabbit. Indeed, the proper, directly selected group property is that of \\"not killing the rabbit too early\\" rather than individual virulence. In situations such as these, we would expect there to be selection for cooperation amongst the viruses in a group in such a way that the group will not \\"kill the rabbit too early\\". It is of course true that any group behavior is the result of individual traits, such as individual viruses suppressing the virulence of their neighbours, but the causes of phenotypes are rarely the causes of fitness differences.  Species and higher levels  It remains controversial among biologists whether selection can operate at and above the level of species. Proponents of species selection include R. A. Fisher (1929); Sewall Wright (1956); Richard Lewontin (1970); Niles Eldredge & Stephen Jay Gould (1972); Steven M. Stanley (1975). Gould proposed that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution, not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms of the Modern Synthesis. If one views species as entities that replicate (speciate) and die (go extinct), then species could be subject to selection and thus could change their occurrence over geological time, much as heritable selected-for traits change theirs over generations. For evolution to be driven by species selection, differential success must be the result of selection upon species-intrinsic properties, rather than for properties of genes, cells, individuals, or populations within species. Such properties include, for example, population structure, their propensity to speciate, extinction rates, and geological persistence. While the fossil record shows differential persistence of species, examples of species- intrinsic properties subject to natural selection have been much harder to document.

It is located under State Street at Atlantic Avenue on the eastern edge of Boston's Financial District near Boston Harbor. The station is named for the nearby New England Aquarium. It is adjacent to Long Wharf, which is used by two MBTA Boat lines. The station has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the Blue Line; an arched ceiling runs the length of the platform level. With the platforms below street level, it is the second-deepest station on the MBTA system (after Porter station). The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened the Atlantic Avenue Elevated on August 22, 1901, with a station at State Street. The BERy opened the East Boston Tunnel under State Street and Long Wharf for streetcars on December 30, 1904. Construction of the intermediate station at Atlantic Avenue under the Elevated was delayed; it opened on April 5, 1906. Unlike other early stations in Boston, which were built with cut-and-cover tunneling, most of Atlantic Avenue station was built as a large barrel vault. The access shaft at the east end of the station was topped with a three-story headhouse, which included a footbridge to the elevated station. Four unusual angled elevators connected the headhouse to the platforms. In 1924, the Boston Transit Department implemented a long-planned project to convert the tunnel from streetcars to high-floor metro trains, with high platforms added at the station. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated closed in 1938, while the subway station remained open. In 1948, the city began replacing the old headhouse and elevators with a smaller structure and escalators. On January 28, 1949, a welder ignited a grease fire that exploded down an elevator shaft, killing three people and burning numerous others. The station was closed until the completion of the renovations in January 1950. The station was renamed Aquarium in 1967 as part of rebranding by the 1964-formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The MBTA began construction on a major renovation of the station in 1996. The platforms were lengthened for six-car trains, new entrances were added west of Atlantic Avenue, and the station was made fully accessible. The station was closed from October 14, 2000 to October 29, 2001; major construction was completed in 2003. Since the renovation, the station has had water leakage issues; it also occasionally floods during high tides and storm surges. The proposed North-South Rail Link includes a possible Central Station for MBTA Commuter Rail trains located under Aquarium station. Station layout The main east headhouse on Long Wharf Aquarium station is located under State Street at its intersection with Atlantic Avenue, near the edge of Boston Harbor. The station has two side platforms‚Äîeach long enough for six-car trains‚Äîserving the two tracks of the Blue Line. The platforms are below street level, making it the second-deepest station on the MBTA system after Porter station. The Tip O'Neill Tunnel, which carries Interstate 93, passes over the center of the station and is supported by its roof. The older eastern part of the platform level has an arched ceiling, which widens to a triple vault in the newer western section. Mezzanines with faregates are located at both ends of the station. The east mezzanine is located on the west end of Long Wharf, near the New England Aquarium. Two glass headhouses‚Äîone with escalators and stairs, the other with an elevator‚Äîprovide access from the surface. The west mezzanine is located under State Street west of Atlantic Avenue, near the Custom House Tower. That mezzanine is accessed by a headhouse‚Äîwhich includes an elevator‚Äîon the south side of State Street, as well as a smaller entrance inside a building on the north side of the street. The station is also served by the MBTA bus route , which runs on Atlantic Avenue at peak hours. Aquarium station is the primary transfer point between the MBTA subway and ferry services on Boston Harbor: MBTA Boat routes F2H and F4 terminate at Long Wharf, as do several Boston Harbor Islands ferry routes. History State Street station alt=The platform of an elevated rapid transit station, with buildings on both sides Construction of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated began on January 21, 1901. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened the line on August 22, 1901, including a stop at State Street. Like the other four stations on the line, State Street had a single elevated island platform with a single mezzanine underneath. Passengers entered the station from staircases on either side of Atlantic Avenue north of State Street, and exited on two staircases to the south. The platform was originally three cars‚Äîabout ‚Äîlong; an extension to allow four-car trains was completed on June 13, 1902. Atlantic Avenue station On May 5, 1900, the Boston Transit Commission (BTC) began construction on the East Boston Tunnel‚Äîa streetcar tunnel between East Boston and downtown Boston under Boston Harbor. Construction started near the eastern terminus in Maverick Square, as the route in downtown Boston was not yet determined. Not until July 25, 1901 did the Commission determine that the Tunnel would run under State Street, with a station at Atlantic Avenue next to busy Long Wharf. The station was constructed in two sections under separate contracts. \\"Atlantic Chambers\\", which served as the west end of the underwater portion of the tunnel, was built in an open cut just west of Atlantic Avenue; it housed the elevators and stairways to access the station as well as the ticket booths. The main arched station, to the west of Atlantic Chambers, was built with drifts. The two side platforms were long, wide, and below the surface. alt=A tunneling machine inside an unfinished arched chamber Atlantic Chambers was a rectangular shaft measuring by , divided by three floors into four smaller chambers. The reinforced concrete walls were between thick. At the east end of each platform was a space for elevators and stairs; these two rooms and the trackway between them occupied the lowest chamber. Construction of Atlantic Chambers began on December 5, 1901, and excavation was complete by May 29, 1903. On June 19, 1903, compressed air in the tunnel to the east blew out the bulkhead into Atlantic Chambers, killing two workers. This air pressure had been necessary to keep water from seeping into the tunnel; after the accident, Atlantic Avenue settled slightly above the tunnel. It was necessary to use additional dunnage to limit sagging of the elevated line above; even so, elevated operations were impacted from June 20 to October 7, 1903. Unlike other early stations in Boston, which were built with cut-and- cover tunneling, most of Atlantic Avenue station was built as a large barrel vault. Drifts were first used to construct the vertical station walls, then the crown of the arch. Transverse sections of the arch were then completed, followed by the invert. The arch was wide and tall; the walls of the station were thick and the arch thick. Work began on this section on March 17, 1902; the last section of arch was completed on June 26, 1903. The rough work of the station vault was completed on August 28, 1903, with the tilework finished on January 19, 1904, and the granolithic platforms on February 10. The Paris M√©tro train fire in August 1903 led the BTC and BERy to desire emergency exits from stations with only a single headhouse. A pair of curved staircases were built from the western ends of the platform; they joined to form a straight staircase above the arch of the tunnel. The exit stairs were completed on September 6, 1904, with a small building in State Street covering them completed on October 10. alt=A two-story structure connected with a footbridge to an elevated rapid transit station A three-story headhouse, measuring , was built over Atlantic Chambers. The ground floor contained the main entrance and exit for the station. The second floor (of nearly identical plan) served a footbridge to the fare mezzanine of State Street station, while the third floor was a machine room for the elevators. The headhouse was designed by Charles Brigham, who had previously designed the Scollay Square and Adams Square headhouses for the Tremont Street Subway. Shafts leading to the headhouse served as the primarily ventilation for the Boston end of the tunnel. Each platform was served with two elevators, which rose to the ground floor and more to the footbridge level. Because the elevators needed to serve the separated platforms and the narrower headhouse, they were built with an angled section with approximately of vertical travel. The elevators were about apart on the platforms and apart at both headhouse levels; as late as the 1940s, the elevators were unique among subway stations. The BTC and BERy agreed in November 1903 to include the footbridge. However, the two could not agree on who should pay for the elevators: the BERy maintained they were a fundamental part of the station infrastructure and thus the responsibility of the BTC, while the BTC considered them an operational item and thus the domain of the BERy. In March 1904, they reached an agreement to allow construction of the elevators and headhouse (so as not to delay the station) while deferring the cost question. (The matter was not settled until a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in 1913.) The BTC awarded the contract for the headhouse on August 15, 1904, with completion scheduled for December 15; however, manufacture of the steel components was severely delayed. The East Boston Tunnel opened on December 30, 1904, serving streetcars which ran between Court Street downtown and Maverick portal in East Boston, where they joined existing surface lines. The only intermediate stop was at Devonshire; Atlantic Avenue station was not yet complete. Most of the headhouse except for some detail work was completed by July 1905; the elevators were tested in January 1906. Atlantic Avenue station opened in the tunnel on April 5, 1906. The Atlantic Avenue and State Street stations had separate fare gates; a paper transfer was required to change lines. Modifications alt=A rapid transit train in an arched underground station In August 1908, the elevated platform was again expanded southwards, this time to eight-car length‚Äîabout ‚Äîto match the length of platforms in the nearly-complete Washington Street Tunnel. An extension of the elevated mezzanine and a second exit stairwell from the elevated platform to the mezzanine opened on October 26, 1908. In 1926, significant repairs were made to the Atlantic Chamber (the headhouse of Atlantic Avenue station). Platform raising The East Boston Tunnel was originally planned to be operated with high-floor metro rolling stock and connected to the then-planned Cambridge Elevated line. When that plan was dropped in 1903 due to a disagreement between the BTC and the BERy, the stations were built with low platforms. Large bi-loading streetcars (with high floors but capable of loading from low platforms), which incorporated many attributes from metro cars used on the Main Line El, began use in 1905. However, neither these nor the large center-entrance cars introduced in 1917 (which were designed for multiple unit operation) could fully handle the crowds. In 1921, the Boston Transit Department (BTD)‚Äîthe successor to the BTC‚Äîbegan work at Maverick Square to convert the East Boston Tunnel to high-floor metro trains. The next year, the BTD board approved the construction of high-level platforms at Atlantic Avenue, Devonshire, Scollay Under, and Bowdoin. Construction of concrete high-level platforms above the rails at Atlantic Avenue began in December 1923 or January 1924. A section of low-level platform was left to serve streetcars during construction. Over the weekend of April 18‚Äì21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted to high-floor metro stock. Temporary wooden platform sections were put in place to allow service to begin on April 21, with the permanent concrete sections completed by July 12. The elevators at Atlantic Avenue were also modified for the new platform heights. The edges of the original low platforms can still be seen under the high platforms. Fire and new headhouse alt=A diagram showing the locations and events of the 1949 fire The East Boston Tunnel cut sharply into East Boston ferry ridership, which in turn reduced connecting ridership on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. The Elevated closed on September 30, 1938, and was torn down during World War II for scrap metal. With the aging headhouse and its connection to the Elevated no longer needed, the city began planning a modernization of the station. A $242,000 contract to purchase four escalators was approved on October 17, 1946. In 1948, the Boston Transit Department awarded a $350,000 contract to add the new escalators, remove the elevators, and construct a new headhouse on the north side of State Street. On January 28, 1949, a grease fire ignited by the acetylene torch of a welder removing one of the elevators spread down the elevator shaft and onto the platforms. The fire occurred during the morning rush hour, with 300 passengers having just alighted from an eastbound train. Most escaped through the emergency exit, which was opened by a passenger, while some used the stairs in the main headhouse. Three people died in the headhouse: two passengers who missed the ground-level exit in the smoke while climbing the stairs and became trapped on the second floor, and one construction worker. (second page) The fire was compared to the 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire due to the intensity of the victims' burns. After the fire, the station was closed until construction was completed. (second page) The fire sparked political debate into the safety record of the MTA (which had replaced the BERy in 1947), and which entity was to blame: the city owned the subway lines and stations within its borders, while the MTA operated them. (second page) The new headhouse was a rectangular structure made of limestone and granite in the Stripped Classical style, with four escalators replacing the old elevators. The station reopened on January 12, 1950. MBTA era The 1950-opened headhouse around 1980 The construction of the Central Artery in the 1950s left the station cut off from Downtown Boston to the west. Atlantic Avenue station was renamed Aquarium on February 13, 1967, as part of a general rebranding by the newly created MBTA‚Äîthe then under-construction New England Aquarium, which opened in 1969, was only some from the existing station. The subway lines were given colored identifying names, with the East Boston Tunnel route becoming the Blue Line, and several other downtown stations were renamed. The station was modernized as part of a $9 million systemwide station improvement program, with a dedication ceremony on August 26, 1968. In the 1970s, part of Atlantic Avenue was relocated a block to the west under the Central Artery for redevelopment, which left Aquarium station on the east side of the realigned street. With its platforms some below street level, Aquarium was the deepest station on the MBTA until Porter station opened in 1984. The aging escalators were responsible for several injuries, including in 1995 when a three-year-old's leg was badly cut. Reconstruction alt=Two elevators and stairs leading up from underground station platforms In 1988, the MBTA began a major renovation project to lengthen Blue Line station platforms for use of six-car trains. On February 14, 1990, the MBTA board voted to move the renovation of Aquarium station‚Äîincluding a new entrance on State Street‚Äîinto final design. The contract for final design was not awarded until June 20, 1992, due to changes associated with the Big Dig project. The revised design called for a reinforced box structure, in which the new Central Artery tunnel would sit, on top of the station arch. In October 1995, the state opened bidding on an estimated $268 million project, which included the station renovations plus the Central Artery tunnel section from State Street to High Street. In 1996, the MBTA began construction of the renovation and platform lengthening project at Aquarium. The work took place during the Big Dig, which moved the Central Artery to the new tunnel and built the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway on the surface. The station was fully closed from October 14, 2000 to October 29, 2001; State was temporarily named \\"State/Aquarium\\" during the closure, and a shuttle bus (route #650) was run between the two stations. Two new entrances were added on State Street west of Atlantic Avenue. A new headhouse with an elevator on the south side of State Street opened on October 29, 2001, and was temporarily the only entrance to the station; an entrance on the north side of the street in the Marketplace Center building opened soon after. The renovated Long Wharf entrance, with two headhouses on the east side of the Kennedy Greenway, did not reopen until September 22, 2003. The entire reconstruction cost $110 million. The reconstructed station was designed by Harry Ellenzweig, who had previously designed Alewife station for the MBTA decades earlier. The original station was extended westward, with wider platforms in the new section. The western extension has a \\"triple vaulted aluminum ceiling\\", with the middle vault matching the curve of the original arch. The fare mezzanines on each end of the station have red slate floors, and aluminum panels cover the walls and ceilings. The headhouses were intended to mimic nearby buildings: the western headhouse incorporates a granite element similar to the adjacent State Street Block, while the sloped eastern headhouses include bricks matching the adjacent Marriott Long Wharf. The lower part of the platform walls are covered by Currents (originally Untitled Wall), a pair of -long black-and-white tile mosaics by Jun Kaneko. They were installed as part of the Arts on the Line program. Water issues alt=A station platform with several puddles of muddy water Since the 1996‚Äì2003 reconstruction, Aquarium station has been plagued by water leaks, which may have been caused either by the renovation or by adjacent Big Dig construction. (Leakage was noticed in the station even before its 1906 opening, albeit at a much smaller rate.) The location of the east headhouse near Boston Harbor has resulted in additional flooding during king tides and storm surges. On January 4, 2018, the station was flooded with ocean water associated with the surge from the January 2018 North American blizzard. It was closed \\"indefinitely\\" but ultimately reopened the next day. A nor'easter that March caused flooding that again briefly closed the station. These floods damaged elevators and escalators at the station, leaving them out of service for months. In 2019, the MBTA began using temporary barriers to control flooding at Aquarium during storms. A permanent fix for both leaks and flooding is estimated to cost $20‚Äì40 million. A 14-day closure of the Blue Line for maintenance work in May 2020 included drainage work at Aquarium. A $1.7 million project, planned to last from August 2020 to early 2021, is adding supports for aluminum planks that can be temporarily installed during high water events. Central Station proposal The North‚ÄìSouth Rail Link (NSRL) is a proposed railway tunnel which would link the two halves of the MBTA Commuter Rail system between North Station and South Station under downtown Boston. It was originally proposed to run deep beneath the Central Artery, passing under Aquarium station at a depth of . In 2003, the MBTA released the Major Investment Study/Draft Environmental Impact Report, which considered two-track and four-track NSRL designs with or without an intermediate Central Station. The station would have platforms between State Street and Broad Street. It would have four headhouses‚Äîtwo just north of Milk Street, and two just south of India Street and East India Row‚Äîplus a direct connection to Aquarium station. The report estimated that adding Central Station would increase commuter rail ridership by between 3,500 and 12,800 daily trips (depending on other elements of the tunnel design), but add between $540 million and $817 million (about one-sixth) to the total costs of construction. During the renovation of Aquarium station, slurry walls were built to a depth of to futureproof for the construction of the NSRL and Central Station. A 2018 re- evaluation of the NSRL examined two-track and four-track alternatives under the Central Artery, as well as two-track alternatives under Congress Street (which was rejected in the 2003 report). Only the more-expensive four-track option would include Central Station. However, the Congress Street alternatives would have their northern station under Haymarket Square rather than under the existing North Station; this would allow for a Blue Line connection at State rather than Aquarium.

His life Caroline Price (Andrew Plimer) Uvedale Price was the eldest son of Robert Price, an amateur artist, by his wife the Hon. Sarah Barrington, daughter of John Shute Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington. Educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, Price inherited the family estate of Foxley (in Yazor in Herefordshire) when he came of age in 1768, a few years after the death of his father in 1761 and of his grandfather (Uvedale Tomkins Price) in 1764. As a young man Price was a figure on London's social scene, and was once described as the \\"macaroni of his age,\\" but with his inheritance and his marriage to Lady Caroline Carpenter, youngest daughter of George Carpenter, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel,Bonhams. Lotnotes for the portret of Caroline Price (1755‚Äì1826), by Andrew Plimer he settled down at Foxley to tend to the estate and develop his theories on landscape, as well as equally controversial work on the pronunciation of the Classical languages. He served as High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1793, and was created a baronet on 12 February 1828. During his life, Price was befriended by Sir George Beaumont and his wife Margaret Beaumont, with whom he corresponded extensively. He was also a lifetime friend of the statesman Charles James Fox as well as being acquainted with William Wordsworth, and in later life, a correspondent of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He died in 1829, having finally printed his work on Greek and Latin pronunciation. His only son Robert succeeded as 2nd (and last) baronet. The Picturesque and Landscape theory Price developed his ideas with his close neighbour Richard Payne Knight, whose poem 'The Landscape' was published the same year as Price's Essay delineating his theories on \\"The Picturesque\\" as a mode of landscape. Well before Price's Essay or Knight's poem, however, the term \\"pittoresque\\" was used in early 18th century France to refer to a property of being \\"in the style of a painter\\". Pope, in his \\"Letter to Caryll\\", brought the word into English as \\"picturesque\\" in 1712. The term was used by various English authors throughout the 18th century (cf. Oxford English Dictionary 'picturesque') before being described by Bagehot in Literary Studies (1879) as \\"a quality distinct from that of beauty, or sublimity, or grandeur.\\" was published posthumously. For Price, the Picturesque was more specifically defined as being located between the Beautiful and the Sublime. In practical application this meant that his preferred mode of landscaping was to retain old trees, rutted paths, and textured slopes, rather than to sweep all these away in the style that had been practised by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown. Price contested, for example, the obsession of \\"The Beautiful\\" with Classical and natural symmetry, arguing instead for a less formal and more asymmetrical interpretation of nature. Price's ideas led to much debate in artistic and literary circles: they were parodied, for example, by Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey. Price republished the Essay several times, with additional material, and entered into a public debate with Humphry Repton over the latter's approach to landscape design. He similarly fell out with Payne Knight, whose theories of landscape betrayed a more esoteric attitude.

The last of the great wizards, Pedro D√°vila, died in 1974, and the craft is quickly being forgotten. There are still a few people who practice \\"white magic\\" in Guazacap√°n. Once the Guazacap√°n area was inhabited by Xinca, one of Guatemala's indigenous groups. They settled there after the Pipil. Currently, there are efforts being made to teach the ancient Xinca language to the newer generations. There is in the town a rich history, and the people who live there keep that history alive through celebrations that incorporate traditional costume, marimba music and folkloric dance.

As a result, achondrites have distinct textures and mineralogies indicative of igneous processes. Achondrites account for about 8% of meteorites overall, and the majority (about two thirds) of them are HED meteorites, possibly originating from the crust of asteroid 4 Vesta. Other types include Martian, Lunar, and several types thought to originate from as-yet unidentified asteroids.

His contributions include the discovery of the anomeric effect and the development of general methodologies for the synthesis of saccharides still employed in the area of carbohydrate chemistry. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Society (England), and a recipient of the prestigious Albert Einstein World Award of Science and Wolf Prize in Chemistry. Life and career Dr. Raymond U. Lemieux was born in Lac La Biche, Alberta, Canada. His family moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 1926. He studied chemistry at the University of Alberta and received a BSc with Honours in Chemistry in 1943. He went on to study at McGill University, where he received his PhD in Organic Chemistry in 1946. He won a post-doctoral scholarship at Ohio State University, where Bristol Laboratories Inc. sponsored his research on the structure of streptomycin. He met his future wife, a doctoral student, at Ohio State and they were married in 1948. In following years, he returned to Canada where he spent two years as an assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan. Next he served as Senior Research Officer at the National Research Council's Prairie Regional Laboratory in Saskatoon. In 1953 he and a fellow researcher, George Huber, were the first scientists to successfully synthesize sucrose. In 1954, he accepted the position of Dean in the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences at the University of Ottawa, where he established their Department of Chemistry. In 1961 he returned to the University of Alberta as a professor in the Chemistry Department and to serve as the Chairman of the Organic Chemistry Division. He developed a method to make synthetic versions of oligosaccharides, which led to improved treatments for leukemia and hemophilia and the development of new antibiotics, blood reagents, and organ anti-rejection drugs. While at the University of Alberta, he established a number of biochemical companies, including R&L; Molecular Research Ltd. in 1962, Raylo Chemicals Ltd. in 1966 (which purchased R&L;) and Chembiomed in 1977 (which has since been taken over by Synsorb Biotech of Calgary, Alberta.)

Personal life and education  Hartsock was born in 1943 in a Methodist lower-middle class family, in Ogden, Utah. She attended Wellesley College. While there, Hartsock was involved in the Wellesley Civil Rights Group. This group provided tutoring in Roxbury and Boston, Massachusetts, as well as working with the Boston NAACP. After finishing college, Hartsock went to get her Masters Degree from the University of Chicago. There, she got involved with a community organization group called The Woodlawn Organization, which was started by activist Saul Alinksky. When Martin Luther King brought the Civil Rights movements north, Hartsock marched to help this movement. After this march, she then help start a graduate student woman's caucus in Political Science. Hartsock received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1972. She was a practiced musician and prior to her dissertation, Hartsock built and played the harpsichord. Hartsock also expressed interest in equestrianism, food, travel and art.  Career  Hartsock was a feminist philosopher. She was known for her work in feminist epistemology and standpoint theory, especially the 1983 essay \\"The Feminist Standpoint\\", Available online. which also integrated Melanie Klein's theories on psychoanalysis and the Oedipal crisis. Her standpoint theory derived from Marxism, which claims that the proletariat has a distinctive perspective on social relations and that only this perspective reveals the truth. She drew an analogy between the industrial labor of the proletariat and the domestic labor of women to show that women can also have a distinctive standpoint. The Feminist Standpoint Revisited and Other Essays was then published in 1998. Hartsock was the first woman to be hired by the University of Michigan, where she taught in the Political Science Department. After a 3 year period, she moved to Washington DC and took a course at IPS on feminist theory in 1973. She then took part in the Quest staff and was in the subscription department where she did writing and editing. Quest lasted for almost 10 years. Once she left Quest, she taught Political Science at Johns Hopkins. There she also helped take part in the effort to bring Woman's Studies to the University. Several years after, she moved to the University of Washington and learned that the Woman's Studies at Johns Hopkins was now a course. Later, she focused her attention on woman‚Äôs labor. Specifically, in the political economic dynamics of globalization. Hartsock then retired in 2009. She served as President of the Western Political Science Association (1994‚Äì95), and was the Co-founder of the Center for Women & Democracy in Seattle, WA, Founding Director (1999-2000).  Death and legacy  In 1985, Hartsock was diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer and lived for 30 more years. Hartsock died on March 19, 2015 in Seattle, Washington.

Zogby (born September 3, 1948) is an American public opinion pollster, author, and public speaker. He is founder of the Zogby International poll. In 1981, Zogby ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Utica, New York. In addition to serving on the advisory boards of the Arab American Institute and Upstate Venture Connect, he is Director of the Keenan Center for Entrepreneurship at Le Moyne College. He also serves as senior partner at John Zogby Strategies, a full-service marketing and political consulting firm. The author of three books, his latest was published in 2016 and is entitled We Are Many, We Are One: Neo-Tribes and Tribal Analytics in 21st Century America. Early years and education Zogby, an internationally-known pollster and author, was born on September 3, 1948 and grew up in Utica, New York. He is the son of Lebanese Catholic immigrants. His brother, James Zogby, is the founder of the Arab American Institute. Zogby received a Bachelor's degree in history from Le Moyne College in 1970 and a Master's degree in history from Syracuse University in 1974, continued and completed Doctoral work (All but Dissertation) in 1978. He taught history and political science for 24 years. Career Zogby launched his first polling company, John Zogby Associates, in 1984, conducting mainly local polls for candidates, parties, and the media in northeastern US communities through the 1980s. In December 1991, polling for several radio and television stations in Upstate New York, he published a poll in New York State showing that then-President George H.W. Bush was leading the state's Governor Mario Cuomo by 6 points in that state. Governor Cuomo decided to not enter the 1992 Presidential race the next day. By 1994, Zogby was polling the New York State gubernatorial race for the New York Post and WNYW- Fox 5. Zogby correctly called the winner, George Pataki, the only pollster to do so. Zogby's company was hired by Reuters News Agency to poll the 1996 presidential race. ‚ÄúAll hail Zogby, the maverick predictor,‚Äù wrote Richard Morin, polling director at The Washington Post, when John Zogby was the only pollster who called the 1996 presidential election with near precision. Zogby achieved the same level of accuracy with his polling in the following two presidential elections. In 1996, he accurately polled the presidential election and repeated his accuracy in polling in the following four presidential elections. He has been featured as a live television election analyst for ABC (Australia), BBC, CBC, and NBC News as well as the Foreign Press Center in Washington since 1998. For over a decade, Zogby led his company's political polling on behalf of Reuters, NBC News, CSPAN, the New York Post, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Miami Herald, the Houston Chronicle, the Buffalo News, the Albany Times Union, and numerous television stations and newspapers throughout the United States. Zogby has been a featured speaker for several associations including the Food Marketing Association, the Texas Cattlemen's Association and the Detroit Economic Club. He has also been the keynote speaker at events sponsored by think tanks including the Center for Strategic and International Studies in DC, Chatham House in London, and the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. His analysis has been published in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and publications worldwide. Advisory boards Zogby was a former advisor at the Belfer Center of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was also a fellow of the Catholic University Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies. He served on the advisory council for Bio-Technology for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and as a Commissioner on the Center for Strategic and International Studies Commission on Smart Power. He previously served on the congressional-created Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World. Zogby is the former chairman of the educational organization Sudan Sunrise. He was chairman of the capital campaign at Mohawk Valley Community College, where he used to teach. He currently serves on the boards of the Arab American Institute and Upstate Venture Connect. Popular culture references John Zogby's polls have been referenced in popular culture, including NBC's The West Wing, CW's Gossip Girl, the Netflix series House of Cards, Richard North Patterson's novel The Race, game shows such as Cash Cab, and the 25th Anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit.

In the early 20th century, the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses on hillsides as a way to intimidate and threaten African Americans and other people of color.http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/virginiavblack.htmlhttps://www.npr.org/2018/11/25/669857481/decades- after-clashing-with-the-klan-a-thriving-vietnamese-community-in-texas Scottish origins In Scotland, the fiery cross, known as the , was used as a declaration of war.Letters from Rupert's Land, 1826‚Äì1840: James Hargrave of the Hudson's Bay The sight of it commanded all clan members to rally to the defence of the area. On other occasions, a small burning cross would be carried from town to town. It was used in the War of 1812 between Britain and the USA as a means of mobilising the Scottish Fencibles and militia settled in Glengarry County, Ontario against the invaders,Sketches Illustrating the Early Settlement and History of Glengarry in Canada. In 1820 over 800 fighting men of Clan Grant were gathered, by the passing of the Fiery Cross, to come to the aid of their Clan Chieftain and his sister in the town of Elgin, Scotland. The last other significant use in Scotland itself was in 1745, during the Jacobite rising,The Capital Scot. and it was subsequently described in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott, particularly The Lady of the Lake of 1810. Sign of the Ku Klux Klan Klan members conduct a cross burning in 1921. In the first era, reconstruction Klans did not burn crosses. This idea was introduced by Thomas Dixon Jr., in his novel, The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan (1905). A cross burning is first described in Book IV Chapter 2 \\"The Fiery Cross\\" on pages 324‚Äì326 of the 1905 edition. It is introduced by one of the characters as \\"the old Scottish rite of the burning cross. It will send a thrill of inspiration to every clansmen in the hills.\\" It is further elaborated that > In olden times when the Chieftain of our people summoned the clan on an > errand of life and death, the Fiery Cross, extinguished in sacrificial > blood, was sent by swift courier from village to village. This call was > never made in vain, nor will it be to-night in the new world.

Griffith's film The Birth of a Nation (1915), an adaptation of Thomas Dixon's novel, The Clansman, two sequences depict cross-burning. The first sequence depicts a Confederate colonel's little sister, who rejects a marriage proposal from a black captain (of the occupying Union force) and then must flee when he chases her (for background, the Piedmont, South Carolina legislature had legalized interracial marriages, and the story imagines the social chaos that whites feared would develop). She is cornered at the edge of a cliff and threatens to jump off the cliff unless he stops. He continues his pursuit, and she jumps. Her brother finds her dying at the bottom of the cliff and holds her in his arms; she identifies her attacker before passing away. The few members of the local clan burn a small (around ) cross, drenched in the young girl's blood. A kangaroo court is convened, hears the colonel's testimony of the girl's dying words, finds the captain guilty of murder, and executes him. The clan members place his body on the front porch of the South Carolina governor's mansion with a square piece of white sheeting with the initials KKK. The second sequence depicts the aftermath of two home invasions. The first occurs at the governor's mansion. A black member of the South Carolina legislature proposes to the governor's daughter and, when she refuses, threatens her with weapons. The governor attempts to intervene and is taken captive. The second home invasion occurs at the house of the Confederate colonel; his mother had been found to be in sympathy of the clan by making clan uniforms. The clan wishes to intervene in these hostage situations but is prevented from doing so by the occupying Union troops. The colonel requests help by burning a cross in daytime; the black smoke produced calls clans from neighboring counties to come to their aid and contest the Union military control of the town. Each clan wears distinct head- dresses and robes. They greet each other with their faces uncovered although they ride into town with sheeting over their faces. The colonel's uniform has two adjacent square crosses on his robe, presumably from the original clan in Scotland. The first instance of a cross being burned in the United States was on November 25, 1915, ten months after the debut of The Birth of a Nation, when a group led by William J. Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain, Georgia, inaugurating a revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The event was attended by 15 charter members and a few aging survivors of the original Klan. Crosses were burned during the Tallahassee bus boycott of 1956.\\"Tallahassee Bus Boycott Timeline\\", Tallahassee Democrat, May 21, 2006, , retrieved 6/4/2025. According to journalist and civil rights advocate Carey McWilliams, several crosses were burned during the '30s in California as part of the intimidation practices of the vigilante groups organized by the Associated Farmers to break off pickers' strikes.McWilliams, Carey (Author), Sackman Douglas C.

It was adopted as official US policy by US President Gerald Ford in November 1975. It was classified for a while but was obtained by researchers in the early 1990s.  Findings  The basic thesis of the memorandum was that population growth in the least developed countries (LDCs) is a concern to US national security, because it would tend to risk civil unrest and political instability in countries that had a high potential for economic development. The policy gives \\"paramount importance\\" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries to control rapid population growth which the US deems inimical to the socio-political and economic growth of these countries and to the national interests of the United States since the \\"U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad\\" and the countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the US. It recommends for US leadership to \\"influence national leaders\\" and that \\"improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.\\"  Named countries  Thirteen countries are named in the report as particularly problematic with respect to US security interests: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The countries are projected to create 47 percent of all world population growth. It also raises the question of whether the US should consider preferential allocation of surplus food supplies to states deemed constructive in use of population control measures.  General oversight  The paper takes a look at worldwide demographic population trends as projected in 1974. It is divided into two major sections: an analytical section and policy recommendations. The analytical section discusses projected world demographic trends and their influence on world food supply, minerals, and fuel. It looks at the relation between economic development in the least developed nations and investigates the implications of world population pressures on US national security. The policy recommendations is divided into two sections. A US population strategy and action to create conditions for fertility decline. A major concern reiterated in the paper concerns the effect of population on starvation and famine. \\"Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.[least developed countries] While under normal weather conditions and assuming food production growth in line with recent trends, total world agricultural production could expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be serious problems in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today's poor nutrition levels, probable in many of the larger more populous LDC regions. Even today 10 to 20 million people die each year due, directly or indirectly, to malnutrition. Even more serious is the consequence of major crop failures which are likely to occur from time to time. \\"The most serious consequence for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive famines in certain parts of the world, especially the poorest regions. World needs for food rise by 2.5 percent or more per year (making a modest allowance for improved diets and nutrition) at a time when readily available fertilizer and well-watered land is already largely being utilized. Therefore, additions to food production must come mainly from higher yields. \\"Countries with large population growth cannot afford constantly growing imports, but for them to raise food output steadily by 2 to 4 percent over the next generation or two is a formidable challenge.\\"  Key insights  *\\"The U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy, Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972]. That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States.... The location of known reserves of higher grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries. The real problems of mineral supplies lie, not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments\\" [Chapter III, \\"Minerals and Fuel\\"]. *\\"Whether through government action, labor conflicts, sabotage, or civil disturbance, the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized. Although population pressure is obviously not the only factor involved, these types of frustrations are much less likely under conditions of slow or zero population growth\\" [Chapter III, \\"Minerals and Fuel\\"]. *\\"Populations with a high proportion of growth. The young people, who are in much higher proportions in many LDCs, are likely to be more volatile, unstable, prone to extremes, alienation and violence than an older population. These young people can more readily be persuaded to attack the legal institutions of the government or real property of the 'establishment,' 'imperialists,' multinational corporations, or other -- often foreign -- influences blamed for their troubles\\" [Chapter V, \\"Implications of Population Pressures for National Security\\"]. *\\"We must take care that our activities should not give the appearance to the LDCs of an industrialized country policy directed against the LDCs. Caution must be taken that in any approaches in this field we support in the LDCs are ones we can support within this country. \\"Third World\\" leaders should be in the forefront and obtain the credit for successful programs. In this context it is important to demonstrate to LDC leaders that such family planning programs have worked and can work within a reasonable period of time.\\" [Chapter I, \\"World Demographic Trends\\"] *\\"In these sensitive relations, however, it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion.\\" *Abortion as a geopolitical strategy is mentioned several dozen times in the report with suggestive implications: \\"No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion.... under developing country conditions foresight methods not only are frequently unavailable but often fail because of ignorance, lack of preparation, misuse and non-use. Because of these latter conditions, increasing numbers of women in the developing world have been resorting to abortion....

Education  Gerlach was born in Biebrich, Hessen-Nassau, German Empire, as son of Dr. med. Valentin Gerlach and his wife Marie Niederhaeuser. He studied at the University of T√ºbingen from 1908, and received his doctorate in 1912, under Friedrich Paschen. The subject of his dissertation was on the measurement of radiation. After obtaining his doctorate, he continued on as an assistant to Paschen, which he had been since 1911. Gerlach completed his Habilitation at T√ºbingen in 1916, while serving during World War I.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Walter Gerlach.  Career  From 1915 to 1918, during the war, Gerlach did service with the German Army. He worked on wireless telegraphy at Jena under Max Wien. He also served in the Artillerie- Pr√ºfungskommission under Rudolf Ladenburg.Mehra and Rechenberg, Vol. 1, Part 2, 2001, 436.Bernstein, 2001, 364. Gerlach became a Privatdozent at the University of T√ºbingen in 1916. A year later, he became a Privatdozent at the University of G√∂ttingen. From 1919 to 1920, he was the head of a physics laboratory of Farbenfabriken Elberfeld, later Bayer-Werke A.G. In 1921, he became a.o. (extraordinary) professor at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main. It was before 17. Feb.1922 that Gerlach succeeded with the experiment on spin quantization in a magnetic field (\\"Richtungsquantelung\\"), later and wrongly called the Stern‚ÄìGerlach effect. The below two lines on Hentschel seem to be a bibliographical notice. Permit me to continue as follows: In \\"Orden pour le M√©rite f√ºr Wissenschaften und K√ºnste\\", Reden und Gedenkworte (speeches and \\"memorials\\"), vol. 16, 1980, Verlag Lambert Schneider in Heidelberg, pp. 47-53, physicist Wolfgang Gentner (1906-1980), evidently a close friend of Gerlach, points out that it was Gerlach who had by himself- given his extraordinary gift for experimenting - after Otto Stern had already in 1921 left for Rostock, where he had been given a professorship- Breitislav, 2003, 53-59.Walther Gerlach and Otto Stern Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik Volume 9, Number 1, 353-355 (1922). successfully carried out the Experiment in Frankfurt before 17. Feb 1922. On this day the \\"critical theorist\\" Wolfgang Pauli sent Gerlach a postcard with congratulations and the remark. \\"Jetzt wird hoffentlich auch der ungl√§ubige Stern von der Richtungsquantelung √ºberzeugt sein\\" (Hopefully the disbelieving Stern will now be convinced of the spin-theory). This clearly hints at Stern's reservatio mentalis and the Experiment could also and fully justified be called the \\"Gerlach-Experiment\\". Otto Stern (compare his article) was among the nominees for the physics Nobel Prize in 1943 and was awarded the prize on 9 November 1944. The citation did not mention the highly important Stern-Gerlach experiment which Walther Gerlach finally carried out successfully early in 1922 during the Weimar Republic in the absence of Otto Stern who had already moved on to Rostock, thus withholding the honour from Gerlach in view of his continued activity in \\"Nazi-led\\" Germany at the end of the war. (Oral information from Prof. Dr. Horst Schmidt-B√∂cking, Institute for nuclear physics, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt/Main in 2015, who conserves the unpublished documentation concerning the differing opinions within the Nobel-Committee on the subject of Walther Gerlach. Schmidt-B√∂cking is also engaged in the physical reassembling of Gerlach's experiment within the planned new Senckenberg-Museum at Frankfurt). In 1925, Gerlach took a call and became an ordinarius professor at the University of T√ºbingen, successor to Friedrich Paschen. In 1929, he took a call and became ordinarius professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, successor to Wilhelm Wien. He held this position until May 1945, when he was arrested by the American and British Armed Forces. From 1937 until 1945, Gerlach was a member of the supervisory board of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (KWG). After 1946, he continued to be an influential official in its successor organization after World War II, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG). On 1 January 1944, Gerlach officially became head of the physics section of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) and Bevollm√§chtigter (plenipotentiary) of nuclear physics, replacing Abraham Esau. In April of that year, he founded the Reichsberichte f√ºr Physik, which were official reports appearing as supplements to the Physikalische Zeitschrift. From May 1945, Gerlach was interned in France and Belgium by British and American Armed Forces under Operation Alsos. From July of that year to January 1946, he was interned in England at Farm Hall under Operation Epsilon, which interned 10 German scientists who were thought to have participated in the development of atomic weapons.The nine other scientists interned at Farm Hall with Gerlach were: Erich Bagge, Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Werner Heisenberg, Horst Korsching, Max von Laue, Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, and Karl Wirtz. Upon Gerlach's return to Germany in 1946, he became a visiting professor at the University of Bonn. From 1948, he became an ordinarius professor of experimental physics and director of the physics department at the University of Munich, a position he held until 1957. He was also rector of the university from 1948 to 1951. From 1949 to 1951, Gerlach was the founding president of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, which promotes applied sciences. From 1949 to 1961, he was the vice-president of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung und F√∂rderung der Forschung (German Association for the Support and Advancement of Scientific Research); also known in short as the Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft (DFG), previously the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft. In 1957, Gerlach was a co-signer of the G√∂ttingen Manifesto, which was against rearming the Federal Republic of Germany with atomic weapons.

Niels Bohr apparently was the only physicist in that time, who was ready to believe in the phenomenon. Therefore it would seem appropriate to speak of the Gerlach- Stern experiment. Stern was awarded the Nobel- Prize in 1944 (for 1943). Gerlach was considered risky, having at the end of the war been active in the Reichsr√ºstungsrat and the Uran(ium) Projekt of the Nazi regime.

It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material. Typically, Soxhlet extraction is used when the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent, and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent. It allows for unmonitored and unmanaged operation while efficiently recycling a small amount of solvent to dissolve a larger amount of material. Description A Soxhlet extractor has three main sections: a percolator (boiler and reflux) which circulates the solvent, a thimble (usually made of thick filter paper) which retains the solid to be extracted, and a siphon mechanism, which periodically empties the thimble. Assembly # The source material containing the compound to be extracted is placed inside the thimble. # The thimble is loaded into the main chamber of the Soxhlet extractor. # The extraction solvent to be used is placed in a distillation flask. # The flask is placed on the heating element. # The Soxhlet extractor is placed atop the flask. # A reflux condenser is placed atop the extractor. Operation The solvent is heated to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a distillation arm, and floods into the chamber housing the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips back down into the chamber housing the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound dissolves in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is emptied by the siphon. The solvent is returned to the distillation flask. The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days. During each cycle, a portion of the non-volatile compound dissolves in the solvent. After many cycles the desired compound is concentrated in the distillation flask. The advantage of this system is that instead of many portions of warm solvent being passed through the sample, just one batch of solvent is recycled. After extraction the solvent is removed, typically by means of a rotary evaporator, yielding the extracted compound. The non-soluble portion of the extracted solid remains in the thimble, and is usually discarded.

Kumagawa extractor Very similar to the Soxhlet extractor, the Kumagawa extractor has a specific design where the thimble holder/chamber is directly suspended inside the solvent flask (having a vertical large opening) above the boiling solvent. The thimble is surrounded by hot solvent vapour and maintained at a higher temperature compared to the Soxhlet extractor, thus allowing better extraction for compounds with higher melting points such as bitumen. The removable holder/chamber is fitted with a small siphon side arm and, in the same way as for Soxhlet, a vertical condenser ensures that the solvent drips back down into the chamber which is automatically emptied at every cycle. History William B. Jensen notes that the earliest example of a continuous extractor is archaeological evidence for a Mesopotamian hot-water extractor for organic matter dating from approximately 3500 BC. The same mechanism is present in the Pythagorean cup. Before Soxhlet, the French chemist Anselme Payen also pioneered with continuous extraction in the 1830s. A Soxhlet apparatus has been proposed as an effective technique for washing mass standards.

The MSM was previously awarded as a decoration for achievement during peacetime, but effective September 11, 2001 this decoration may also be bestowed in lieu of the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement in a designated combat theater. Normally, the acts or services rendered must be comparable to that required for the Legion of Merit but in a duty of lesser, though considerable, responsibility. Within the U.S. Army, according to AR 600-8-22, Paragraph 3-16, the MSM may not be upgraded to or downgraded from a recommended Bronze Star Medal. In the Army, an MSM recommendation that is downgraded will be approved as an Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM). A higher award and decoration, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (DMSM), is intended for similar services performed under joint duty within the United States Department of Defense, to include the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, and joint task forces under their cognizance. Recipients In the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) are typically field grade officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (major, lieutenant colonel, colonel), senior U.S. Army chief warrant officers in pay grades W-3 through W-5 (CW3 to CW5), and senior non-commissioned officers (E-7 to E-9) in both the Army and the Air Force. Award of the MSM may be for meritorious performance while serving in a staff position as a field grade officer, senior chief warrant officer, or senior non-commissioned officer, or, in the case of field grade officers, for successful completion of a command tour at the battalion (Army) or squadron (Army or Air Force) level. Award of the MSM to company grade officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain), junior warrant officers and chief warrant officers in pay grades W-1 and W-2 (WO1 and CW2, Army only), and junior NCOs in pay grades E-6 and below is rare and typically by exception. The U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard subscribe to a slightly different philosophy from the Army and the Air Force in awarding the MSM, typically reserving it for senior Navy and Coast Guard officers in pay grades O-5 to O-6 (commander and captain) and Marine Corps field grade officers in pay grades O-5 and O-6 (lieutenant colonel and colonel), with the first award of the MSM typically occurring after completion of a successful commanding officer assignment at the O-5 level. Award of the MSM to USN, USMC, and USCG officers in pay grade O-4 (USN & USCG lieutenant commander / USMC major) and below, to include chief warrant officers and below (other than as an award at retirement to CWO5 and CWO4) is typically by exception and normally limited to those who have held one of the service's handful of O-4‚Äìlevel commanding officer assignments (e.g., Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship) or serving on a USN or USCG flag officer staff or USMC general officer staff. Enlisted award of the MSM in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard is likewise typically limited to pay grades E-8 (e.g., USN/USCG senior chief petty officer and USMC master sergeant or first sergeant) and E-9 (e.g., USN/USCG master chief petty officer and USMC sergeant major or master gunnery sergeant), while award of the MSM to pay grade E-7 (e.g., USN/USCG chief petty officer and USMC gunnery sergeant) and below is very rare and by exception. In the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the awarding authority for the MSM must be either a flag officer or general officer holding the pay grade of O-7 or above. It is most common for Navy and Coast Guard master chief petty officers (typically command master chief petty officers) and Marine Corps master gunnery sergeants and sergeants major to receive the MSM as an end-of-tour award or upon retirement. Foreign military personnel in the ranks of NATO OF-5 (US O-6 equivalent) and below and individuals who have displayed a level of service that warrants an award of such magnitude may also be eligible to be awarded the MSM, subject to approval by a U.S. flag officer or general officer. To receive this medal, the individual must exhibit exceptionally meritorious service at that level of responsibility. Design and devices The Meritorious Service Medal is a bronze medal, 1.5 inches in diameter overall, consisting of six rays issuant from the upper three points of a five-pointed star with beveled edges and containing two smaller stars defined by incised outlines; in front of the lower part of the star an eagle with wings upraised standing upon two upward curving branches of laurel tied with a ribbon between the feet of the eagle. The reverse has the encircled inscriptions \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" and \\"MERITORIOUS SERVICE.\\" The suspension ribbon is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 1/8 inch Crimson 67112; 1/4 inch White 67101; center 5/8 inch Crimson; 1/4 inch White; and 1/8 inch Crimson. Additional awards of the Meritorious Service Medal are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, with one silver oak leaf cluster denoting five additional awards. (1 silver OLC plus the medal itself represents six) and gold 5/16 inch stars in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard (with a 5/16 inch silver star denoting five additional awards). These devices are also authorized for wear on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. In certain instances, the U.S. Coast Guard also authorizes an Operational Distinguishing Device for the medal. History At the Tri- Department Awards Conference (February 5, 1968), there was a discussion on the need for a third meritorious award to provide appropriate recognition for non- combat achievement or service comparable to that of the Bronze Star Medal for combat achievement or service. It was felt that the Legion of Merit's prestige was slipping because it was being used with increasing frequency to reward service below the Legion of Merit's intended standard, but higher than that required for the Commendation Medals of the various military services.Air Force Personnel Center Meritorious Service Medal An ad hoc committee was formed by the Secretary of Defense (M&RA) to select a name. On November 8, 1968, the committee unanimously approved the name \\"Meritorious Service Medal\\". President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Meritorious Service Medal per , dated January 16, 1969. The Executive Order was amended by President Ronald Reagan per , dated July 2, 1981, to authorize award to members of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations. Prior to 2004, the MSM could only be awarded for peacetime service and could not be awarded in a combat zone, the MSM equivalent for those zones being the Bronze Star Medal (BSM). As in 1968 when the MSM was created, there were concerns that the prestige of the BSM was also slipping during combat operations in Southwest Asia that had essentially been continuous since 1990. In 2004, authority to award the MSM for combat zone service was authorized, retroactive to September 11, 2001. The medal was designed by Mr. Jay Morris of the Institute of Heraldry, and the design was approved by the committee on March 20, 1969. The ribbon design purposely follows the colors used for the Legion of Merit to reflect the parallel between the two medals. The eagle, symbol of the United States, stands on laurel branches denoting achievement. The star is used to represent the military service and the rays emanating therefrom denote the constant efforts of individuals to achieve through excellent and meritorious service.

Balaos keel was laid down on 26 June 1942 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Jane Aylward, wife of Lieutenant Commander Theodore C. Aylward, commissioned on 4 February 1943, Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Crane (USNA Class of 1931) in command; and reported to the United States Pacific Fleet.  World War II  After a six-week training period in New London, Conn., the submarine sailed for the Pacific Theater of Operations and joined the 7th Fleet at Brisbane, Australia, on 10 July 1943.  First patrol, July ‚Äì September 1943  At the end of a brief refit alongside submarine tender , Balao got underway on 25 July to begin her first war patrol. She topped off her fuel tanks from submarine rescue vessel on 29 July, and on 7 August took station in the scouting line in the sealanes between Truk and the Bismarck Archipelago. However, she made only five enemy contacts and was unable to launch a single attack. The scouting line was discontinued on 26 August, and Balao shifted to patrol the Palau‚ÄìRabaul shipping route where she fared no better. The submarine trained in emergency dives, and her crew frequently went to battle stations upon the sighting of enemy aircraft; but the patrol was not enlivened by action with surface ships before the boat moored alongside Fulton in Brisbane on 13 September for refit.  Second patrol, October ‚Äì November 1943  Her second war patrol began on 4 October when Balao sailed in company with for Tulagi. After refueling there on 11 October, the submarine got underway for her assigned area north of the Bismarck Archipelago and again covered the Palau-Rabaul routes. Balao sighted a convoy on 17 October, but it escaped her salvo of six torpedoes by making a radical zig-zag maneuver and increasing speed to open the range. The convoy's escorts counterattacked with depth charges, but Balao came away unscathed. Her targets moved out of range at high speed, preventing her from regaining contact. Balao joined Silversides in a coordinated attack on a seven-ship convoy on 23 October, firing 10 torpedoes at three ships that presented an overlapping target. She scored six hits. One ship was seen down by the bow, with her stern in the air; another listed heavily; and a third was riding low in the water. While Balao was maneuvering into position for a second attack, the convoy's escorts fired on her, forcing the submarine to dive. Balao lost contact with the convoy and failed in her attempts to reach Silversides to exchange information. She later learned, however, that her consort sank three of the seven ships. Balao stopped at Tulagi to refuel and to load torpedoes. On 28 October, she was assigned to a scouting line south of Truk. On 4 November, the submarine made a submerged approach to a two-ship convoy, but the six torpedoes that she fired missed their marks. Balao then shifted to the Truk-New Hanover route where she conducted an uneventful patrol until 7 November, when she headed for Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit alongside Fulton.  Third patrol, December 1943 ‚Äì January 1944  Underway again on 6 December, Balao spent two days in training exercises and practice approaches with Coucal as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol. No surface contacts came during the first two weeks, but her luck changed on 27 December when two s and two s crossed her track. The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no sign of damage. The warships were long gone at their high speed. Balao began the year 1944 with a contact that turned out to be a very large steamer and two escorts. The weather impeded her efforts to close the convoy, but also offered protection when a rain squall covered Balao while she fired six torpedoes. The submarine counted three explosions and then went deep to wait out the inevitable depth charge attack by the escorts. When Balao surfaced the next morning, the convoy had disappeared. Certain that the freighter had been sunk, Balao resumed her patrol of the shipping lanes. She later sighted a convoy of a damaged freighter and two escorts and moved in for an attack only to discover that the freighter was her target of 1 January. The escorts drove Balao off, and on 7 January, she was ordered back to Brisbane, still without a confirmed kill under her belt.  Fourth patrol, February ‚Äì March 1944  Balao arrived in Brisbane on 15 January for a normal two week refit and a brief training period. On 6 February, she was underway via Tulagi for her patrol area north of New Guinea, which she entered on 13 February. Her first opportunity to attack came just after midnight on 23 February when she closed a convoy of two freighters and one small escort. Balao fired six torpedoes at the larger of the two freighters, scoring three hits. The escort maneuvered to attack, but never came close to the submarine. Rather than risk a repetition of her disappointment during her last patrol, Balao returned to the scene to verify that the ship had sunk. A survivor was taken on board, who stated that his vessel, the 5,857-ton passenger cargo ship Nikki Maru, had gone down rapidly after being hit. A convoy located on 26 February did not offer a chance of attack, because had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase Balao from the scene. Two days later, Balao sighted smoke on the horizon and commenced tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, Balao went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine swung her stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. Balao heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a gun on Balao, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before Balao could be hit. The submarine could see nothing except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two \\"pips\\" disappeared from the screen. Balao lured the escort out of the target area in order to double back to look for the third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so Balao returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter Shoho Maru and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship Akiuro Maru. On 3 March, Balao fired four torpedoes at a small freighter and escort from a distance that proved to be too great. All four fish passed under their targets. Later that morning, Balao sighted a convoy of four small cargo ships, described as \\"the dregs of the worst of harbors.\\" The convoy changed course and pulled away from the submarine before she could close for attack. The next day, Balao investigated smoke on the horizon, found two cargo ships, tracked them through a rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged to wait out the inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.  Fifth patrol, April ‚Äì June 1944  Balao completed refit and training on 24 April and the next day began her voyage back to action. After stopping for a few hours at Midway to refuel, she continued to her patrol area around the Palau Islands. She contacted a small convoy on 14 May but was unable to close for attack because of the diligence of the Japanese escorts. The submarine returned to patrolling the Yap‚ÄìPalau shipping lanes. Her next contacts were unfavorable for attack, and problems with her surface search radar hampered her efforts to seek out enemy shipping. On 1 June, the situation brightened. Balao made radar contact with a four-ship convoy and tracked it to an excellent position for attack. Just after midnight on 2 June, she fired six bow fish at one of the largest passenger cargo ships, and scored two hits. Although pursued by the escorts, Balao again managed to close the convoy, now with only two ships visible. Only minutes before Balao reached firing position, one of the escorts unwittingly moved to a spot on Balaos beam and stayed there, thwarting the submarine's second attempt. She was prevented from carrying out a dawn attack by Japanese air cover and was forced to allow the convoy to escape without further damage. A fuel shortage forced Balao to enter Majuro Atoll on 12 June to begin refit alongside submarine tender .  Sixth patrol, July ‚Äì August 1944  Balao began her sixth war patrol on 5 July when she departed Majuro for the Palau area. The submarine made a few contacts, but none worthy of pursuit. On 26 July, Balao joined in the bombardment of Angaur Island in the Palaus by firing on a lighthouse and loading docks, scoring several direct hits. The same day, she witnessed a fighter plane from the carrier splash into the water dead ahead and quickly managed to rescue the pilot. After transferring him to , Balao returned to lifeguard duties off Peleliu Island where she picked up two more downed aviators on 27 July. On 29 July, Balao joined in a coordinated attack on two sampans, engaging them with gunfire until the Japanese abandoned ship and the sampans were destroyed. She then resumed patrol duty and continued the task until 12 August, when she rendezvoused with and headed for Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. Balao was then ordered back to the United States where she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on 20 August for a complete overhaul. Upon the completion of that work, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 November and prepared to return to the war in the Pacific.  Seventh patrol, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945  Balao left Pearl Harbor on 4 December and rendezvoused with and en route Tanapag Harbor. The trio of submarines reached port on 15 December and moored in a nest alongside Fulton. After topping off fuel, water, and provisions on 17 December, they got underway to patrol the Yellow Sea in a coordinated attack group. Until 2 January 1945, their only contacts were fishing craft and floating mines. On that day, however, Balao sighted the masts of a sailing vessel. She closed the three masted schooner and surfaced to attack. Her first two torpedoes missed the target, but the third hit squarely amidships and sank the vessel. That day proved to be lucky for Balao because, later that night, she picked up a larger ship on radar and successfully moved into position. Early on 8 January, she fired six torpedoes, three of which scored; but the stubborn \\"tanker\\" remained afloat despite being dead in the water. Balao fired seven more torpedoes for three more direct hits, but the target still refused to sink. The submarine closed in on the badly damaged tanker and fired another trio of fish, one of which struck the final blow. However, Japanese records examined after the war indicate that Balaos victim on this occasion was not a tanker, but the 5,244-ton freighter Daigo Maru. After that, Balao patrolled independently until 19 January when she pulled into Apra Harbor, Guam, for refit alongside .  Eighth patrol, February ‚Äì April 1945  Balao began her eighth war patrol on 27 February as part of another attack group along with (like Balao, also the lead ship of a submarine class), , and on patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. Her first opportunity for action came on 9 March, when she sighted a small tanker with two escorts steaming along the coastline. Although not in an ideal attack position, the submarine fired four torpedoes at the tanker, all of which missed. The target's escorts struck back at Balao with depth charges, but the submarine escaped damage and resumed patrol duty later that day. She sighted many vessels during the next eight days, but did not attack them. On 18 March, Balao caught a 188-ton trawler alone, sank it with gunfire, and then rescued three survivors in the debris. Early the next morning, she attacked a convoy of four transports guarded by four escorts. Firing 10 torpedoes at three of the targets, Balao heard four hits and the explosion on one of the transports nearly blinded her lookouts. The early morning darkness made it impossible to assess the damage, but Balao received credit for sinking Hakozaki Maru, a 10,413-ton transport. {The Tatsuhara Maru was damaged}. The submarine then escaped to deep water to continue her patrol. Later that same afternoon, Balao surfaced to attack a group of small trawlers. She sank one trawler and left three others burning fiercely. Shortly before dawn on 21 March, Balao began tracking a convoy of two ships closely guarded by four escorts. The effectiveness with which the escorts countered her several approaches convinced Balao that she had been detected. As dawn broke, the submarine made one last approach, moving to where she fired four torpedoes. An escort picked up the submarine's trail, and Balao ran for deep water under a smoke screen without waiting to observe results. On 26 March, Balao encountered the 880-ton cargo ship, Shinto Maru No. 1, and sank her with gunfire. A small Japanese patrol vessel made an attempt to counterattack, but Balao slipped below the surface and headed for Guam to replenish her fuel, provisions, and torpedoes. On 2 April, Balao submerged rapidly to avoid detection by a large, low-flying enemy plane and took on several feet of water in her conning tower, grounding out her radar and other electrical gear. Despite these problems, she arrived safely at Guam on 8 April for refit.  Ninth patrol, May ‚Äì June 1945  The submarine began her ninth patrol on 3 May when she headed for the Yellow Sea to patrol in a wolfpack with , , and . Targets were scarce and mechanical difficulties plagued Balao. On 19 May, the submarine attacked a small freighter, but all three of the torpedoes that she fired missed the target. Nevertheless, she did win a consolation prize when one of her torpedoes struck and sank a nearby 30-ton junk. On 23 May, Balaos earlier mechanical difficulties rendered her stern diving planes totally inoperable, and she received orders to Pearl Harbor for refit. En route, she embarked a sailor from suffering from appendicitis and an injured crewman. Later that evening, although the radar scope was clear and no other submarines were known to be in the vicinity, Balao was suddenly attacked by torpedoes. The quick reactions of the officer of the deck caused two to pass to port and two to starboard. The submarine continued on to Midway where she arrived on 3 June, discharged her passengers, and set a course for Pearl Harbor where she arrived four days later.  Tenth patrol, July ‚Äì August 1945  A month in port readied her for sea once more, and Balao got underway on 7 July for the Nanp≈ç Islands area and waters east of Honsh≈´. Her primary duty during this tenth and final war patrol was to provide lifeguard services for Allied aircrew during strikes on the Japanese home islands. Balao operated with air cover while on station and rescued four aviators during the patrol. Japan had been so weakened by the final weeks of the war that surface contacts were scarce. She was able to sink one picket boat and damage another with gunfire on 14 August. Word of Japan's capitulation came on 15 August along with orders to cease fire. Balao rendezvoused with the next day to transfer the rescued aviators, then proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 25 August.  Post-War  The submarine departed Pearl Harbor on 31 August for Staten Island, New York, where her crew enjoyed a well-deserved rest period and she underwent an overhaul. Balao was decommissioned on 20 August 1946, and she was berthed in New London, Conn., as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  1952‚Äì1963  Balao was recommissioned on 4 March 1952 at the U.S. Naval Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, Lieutenant Commander S. V. Hadley in command, and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet's Submarine Squadron 4 (SubRon 4). After shakedown training, the submarine was reassigned to SubRon 12 at the U.S. Naval Base in Key West, Fla. There, she served primarily as a training ship for antisubmarine and Special Development Forces in the Key West and Guantanamo Bay operating areas. After making several goodwill visits to ports in the southern United States, Balao joined the ships of Destroyer Squadron 24 (DesRon 24) in a combined antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training and goodwill cruise to South America that began on 6 January 1957. After joint exercises with the navies of several South American countries, the ship made liberty calls to principal ports such as La Guaira, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The submarine returned to Key West on 22 March. Balao deployed to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base four times in the next year, spending one month each time training surface ships in \\"refresher training.\\" The submarine departed Key West on 19 July 1958 for an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Upon its completion on 13 November, Balao conducted refresher training at New London, Conn. and Newport, Rhode Island. After Balaos return to Key West on 30 November, she and spent 12 days of December in hunter-killer training.  Operation Petticoat  Balao starred as the \\"pink submarine\\" in the 1959 comedy film Operation Petticoat, co-starring with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis (photo).  Return to service  After her fame and stardom Operation Petticoat had subsided in 1960, Balao returned to local training operations. On 1 April, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-285, but continued to serve as a training ship. On 3 March 1961, Balao simulated a disabled submarine for the testing of a new device for individual escape. The mechanism, known as the \\"Steinke hood,\\" enabled Commander W. F. Mazzone and Lieutenant H. E. Steinke, the hood's inventor, to ascend from a depth of to the surface in 55 seconds, setting a new record. From 28 June‚Äì4 November, the submarine underwent overhaul and battery renewal. She returned to Key West and resumed services in training. In April 1962, Balao deployed to the Mediterranean Sea where she joined the 6th Fleet for four months of exercises with other NATO navies. Balao also deployed to the western Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October‚ÄìNovember, but returned to routine training duty when the trouble died down.  Decommissioning  Balaos conning tower preserved in the Washington Navy Yard In 1963, the Board of Inspection and Survey determined Balao to be unfit for further service. The submarine was decommissioned on 1 August 1963, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that same day. Her hulk was sunk off the coast of northern Florida on 6 September as a target. Before this occurred, her conning tower and periscope shears were removed, and are on display on the waterfront at the National Museum of the United States Navy of the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C..

A member of the Hip Sing Tong criminal society from San Francisco, California, Gee was sentenced to death for the murder of an elderly member from another gang in Nevada. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at Nevada State Prison led to the development of the gas chamber. Background Gee Jon was born of Cantonese descent in China around 1895. He immigrated to the United States between 1907 and 1908 and spent most of his life at San Francisco's Chinatown in California. Gee became a member of the Hip Sing Tong society, which dealt in narcotics and liquor. In 1922, territorial disputes with the rival Bing Kong Tong society led to the outbreak of hostilities. Death of Tom Quong Kee Tom Quong Kee was a 74-year-old laundry proprietor who was a member of the Bing Kong Tong in Mina, Nevada. Hughie Sing, his American- educated apprentice of two years, pointed Kee out as a target for Gee. During the night of August 27, 1921, Gee knocked on the door of Kee's residence while armed with a Colt .38 revolver. Gee fatally shot Kee, who answered the door in his pajamas. Unlike many other Tong killings, Gee and Sing were apprehended. Trial and sentencing Gee and Sing were defended by attorneys James M. Frame and Fiore Raffetto. Gee and Sing were both convicted and sentenced to death in the District Court of Mineral County, Nevada. Sing's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment because he was only nineteen years old and Gee had committed the shooting itself. A bill authorizing the use of lethal gas had passed the Nevada State Legislature in 1921, making Gee eligible to become the first person to be executed by this method. Frame argued that Gee's sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment, but his appeal was denied. The Supreme Court of Nevada instead complimented the state legislators for \\"inflicting the death penalty in the most humane manner known to modern science.\\" Raffetto unsuccessfully filed a writ of certiorari with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Gee was incarcerated in Nevada State Prison at Carson City. Execution Denver S. Dickerson supervised the execution. The California Cyanide Company of Los Angeles, California, was the only distributor of liquid cyanide in the western United States and refused to deliver it to Carson City over liability concerns. The poison was used to eradicate pests from citrus groves in California. Warden Denver S. Dickerson sent his assistant Tom Pickett to Los Angeles to personally pick up 20 pounds of lethal gas, which was contained in a mobile fumigating unit that cost $700. Four guards who did not want to participate in the process had resigned. The officials first attempted to pump poison gas directly into Gee's cell while he was sleeping, but without success because the gas leaked from the cell. A makeshift gas chamber was set up at the butcher shop of the prison. At least one cat was used to test the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. Gee was strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses to look inside. Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army. Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to \\"Brace up!\\" At 9:40 a.m. on February 8, 1924, the pump sprayed four pounds of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20 p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died. Reaction The Nevada State Journal proclaimed, \\"Nevada's novel death law is upheld by the highest court ‚Äî humanity.\\" However, the San Jose Mercury News printed, \\"One hundred years from now Nevada will be referred to as a heathen commonwealth controlled by savages with only the outward symbols of civilization.\\" Warden Dickerson reported to Nevada governor James G. Scrugham and the legislature his opinion that the use of lethal gas was impractical and that he thought execution by firing squad was still the best method of execution.

Particles can remain in suspension in the ocean or freshwater. However, they eventually settle (rate determined by Stokes' law) and accumulate as sediment. Some can enter the atmosphere through wave action where they can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Many organisms filter particles out of the water with unique filtration mechanisms (filter feeders). Particles are often associated with high loads of toxins which attach to the surface. As these toxins are passed up the food chain they accumulate in fatty tissue and become increasingly concentrated in predators (see bioaccumulation). Very little is known about the dynamics of particles, especially when they are re-suspended by dredging. They can remain floating in the water and drift over long distances. The decomposition of some particles by bacteria consumes much oxygen and can cause the water to become hypoxic. Particle analysis Particle levels in water (or air) can be measured with a turbidity meter and analyzed with a particle counter. They can also be scanned with an underwater microscope, such as ecoSCOPE. Particles scanned with the ecoSCOPE microscope. The blue frame is a 1 mm contrast grid. Contaminant kinetics It takes a few days until plankton organisms have filtered the particles and incorporated the toxins into their body fat and tissue: In the southwards flow of the waters of the Hudson off the coast of New Jersey, the highest levels of mercury in copepods have not been found directly in front of the river off New York but 150 km south, off Atlantic City. Many copepods are then captured by mysidae, krill and smallest fish like the juveniles of atlantic herring - and in each step of the foodchain the toxin concentrations increase by the factor of 10. The milk of mothers (Homo sapiens) consuming fish and related products like margarine and eggs in such areas have so high toxin levels that it would be impossible to sell such milk on markets - their babies have much more birth-defects and/or retarded brains and have later difficulties to learn and/or reproduce. Many die at an early age. Filter of krill Filter of krill: The first degree filter setae carry in v-form two rows of second degree setae, pointing towards the inside of the feeding basket. The purple ball is one micrometer in size. To display the total area of this fascinating particle filtration structure one would have to tile 7500 times this image. Filter basket of a mysid.

Monograms are often made by combining the initials of an individual or a company, used as recognizable symbols or logos. A series of uncombined initials is properly referred to as a cypher (e.g. a royal cypher) and is not a monogram.The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Fifth edition; 2002) defines it as a \\"device composed of two or more letters... interwoven together.\\" Volume 1, p. 1820. History The \\"AD\\" monogram that Albrecht D√ºrer used as a signature Monograms first appeared on coins, as early as 350BC. The earliest known examples are of the names of Greek cities which issued the coins, often the first two letters of the city's name. For example, the monogram of Achaea consisted of the letters alpha (Œë) and chi (Œß) joined together.Henry Noel Humphreys, The Coin Collector's Manual, Or Guide to Numismatic Student in the Formation of a Cabinet of Coins (Bibliolife, 2008), 226. Monograms have been used as signatures by artists and craftsmen on paintings, sculptures and pieces of furniture, especially when guilds enforced measures against unauthorized participation in the trade. A famous example of a monogram serving as an artist's signature is the \\"AD\\" used by Albrecht D√ºrer. Christograms The Chi-Rho, a monogram of the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ Over the centuries, monograms of the name of Jesus Christ have been used as Christian symbols. The IX monogram consists of the initial Greek letters of the name \\"Jesus Christ,\\" \\"I\\" for ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœçœÇ, (Jesus in Greek) and \\"X\\" for ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ (Christ in Greek). The \\"IHS\\" Christogram, denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, is usually written as a cypher, but sometimes as a monogram. Perhaps the most significant Christogram is the Chi Rho, formed from the first two letters of ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ. The symbol was used by the Roman emperor Constantine I (r. 306‚Äì337) as part of a military standard. Royal monograms Cross-signature of Charlemagne Signum manus (sometimes also known as Chrismon) refers to the medieval practice, current from the Merovingian period until the 14th century in the Frankish Empire and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of monogram or royal cypher. Monograms of the names of monarchs are used as part of the insignia of public organizations in kingdoms, such as on police badges. This indicates a connection to the ruler. However, the royal cypher, so familiar on pillar boxes, is not technically a monogram, since the letters are not combined. Royal monograms often appear on coins, frequently surmounted by a crown. Countries that have employed this device in the past include Bulgaria, Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and many German states. Today, several Danish coins carry the monogram of Margrethe II, while the current Norwegian 1 Krone coin has the \\"H5\\" monogram of Harald V on the obverse.Coins , at the Norges Bank website. The only countries using the Euro to have a royal monogram as their national identifying mark are Belgium and Monaco.A commemorative ‚Ç¨2 coin from Luxembourg carried the monogram of Grand Duke Henri. In Thailand, royal monograms appear on the individual flag for each major royal family member. Individual monograms Dress shirt monogram locations An individual's monogram may appear in stylized form on stationery, luggage, clothing, or other personalized items. These monograms may have two or three letters. A basic 3-letter monogram has the initial of the individual's last name (surname) set larger, or with some special treatment in the center, while the first name initial appears to the left of it and the middle name initial appears to the right of it. There is a difference in how this is written for men and women. For example, if the individual's name is Mary Ann Jones, and Jones is the surname, then the arrangement of letters would be thus: MJA, with the surname initial set larger in the center, the M for Mary to the left and the A for Ann to the right.Jeanine Twigg, Embroidery Machine Essentials: How to Stabilize, Hoop and Stitch Decorative Designs, KP Craft, 2001, , p. 43. Traditionally, individual monograms for menhttps://www.simplystamps.com/blog/2016/06/30/monogram-guide-how-to/ are based on the order of the name. The name Kyle George Martin would be written (KGM). Married or engaged couples may use two-letter monograms of their entwined initials, for example on wedding invitations. Married couples may also create three-letter monograms incorporating the initial of their shared surname. For example, the monogram MJA might be used for Michael and Alice Jones. However, monogramming etiquette for the married couple varies according to the item being monogrammed. Linens, for example, typically list the woman's given initial first, followed by the couple's shared surname initial and then the man's given initial (AJM). Monograms can often be found on custom dress shirts where they can be located in a number of different positions. Some personal monograms have become famous symbols in their own right and instantly recognizable to many, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's monogram. Other monograms UT monogram Some companies and organizations adopt a monogram for a logo, usually with the letters of their acronym. For example, as well as having an official seal, and the Texas Longhorns logo, the University of Texas at Austin uses a \\"UT\\" monogram (in the same color as the Longhorns logo, burnt orange). The New York Yankees baseball team also uses a monogram on their ball cap insignia. The Consolidated Edison logo, with a rounded \\"E\\" nested inside a \\"C,\\" has been described as a \\"classic emblem.\\"BusinessWeek online, Con Ed: The Power of a Logo, 11 August 2005. The \\"VOC\\" monogram logo of the Dutch East India Company (\\"Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie\\" in Dutch) was possibly the first globally recognized corporate logo.Brook, Timothy: Vermeer's Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World. (New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2008), p. 16 Many fashion companies have a monogram for a logo, including Louis Vuitton and Fendi. The connected \\"CC\\" company logo, created by Coco Chanel, is one of the most recognizable monograms internationally. Athletes have also been known to brand merchandise with their monogram logo; notably Tiger Woods and Roger Federer.  Resistance symbols in wartime  \\\\- \\"Fighting Poland\\" A notable example of a royal monogram is the H7 monogram of King Haakon VII of Norway. While in exile during World War II, Haakon VII spearheaded the Norwegian resistance to the German occupation, and H7 became a symbol used by the Norwegian populace to mark solidarity and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the Norwegian resistance movement. The act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in German-occupied Norway was punishable by imprisonment. Similarly, in Poland during the war, the \\"PW\\" monogram was used as a resistance symbol, known as 'The Anchor' (), due to its characteristic shape. Its meaning varied, as the initials were useful for many different slogans, such as 'Poland Fights', 'Warsaw Uprising', 'Polish Army', and others. Like the Norwegian example above, its use was punished by the Nazi occupation authorities. Japanese A Japanese rebus monogram is a monogram in a particular style, which spells a name via a rebus, as a form of Japanese wordplay or visual pun.

United played 18 games in the 1919‚Äì20 season as members of the West Lancashire League and also entered the Richardson Cup. The club applied to join the Lancashire Combination for the 1920‚Äì21 season and continued as Wigan United for a further nine games (P9 L9) before being forced to close by the Lancashire FA as they were found guilty of paying their players for \\"lost time\\", which contravened rules of the time. A new club, Wigan Association, was formed on 6 November 1920, taking over the fixtures of Wigan United for four games (P4 D1 L3). After this short period the F.A. agreed that all their demands had been met with the exception that the club would have to change their name again to avoid confusion with Wigan FC, the town's rugby league team, allowing Wigan Association to become officially known as Wigan Borough Football Club on 11 December 1920.Wigan Observer 20 December 1920 page 3 column 4 The newly named Wigan Borough applied for entrance to the football league's Third Division North for the 1921‚Äì22 season, despite only finishing 17th of 18 clubs in the Lancashire Combination league.

Historically a part of Lancashire, Castleton's early history is marked by its status as a township within the ancient parish of Rochdale. Prior to merging with the County Borough of Rochdale in 1900, Castleton experienced rapid growth during the 19th century as a mill town in its own right, facilitated for the most part by the construction of the Rochdale Canal which is routed through the area. Castleton's growth was significant; so much so, that for a time it was almost the same size of nearby Rochdale. Located between junctions 19 and 20 of the M62 motorway, Castleton today is a predominantly residential area, with a total population of 9,715, increasing to 10,159 at the 2011 Census. History Arrow Mill is a former cotton mill and Grade II listed building in Castleton The most ancient known reference to Castleton is found in the Domesday Book (1086). The name suggests a link with a fortification; the Castleton area was the site of Rochdale Castle. The castle is believed to have been located on the south bank of the River Roch, which runs through Castleton. During the 13th century, Castleton was known as Castletown, or Castle Town. Back around the time the canal was built, Castleton was known as Blue Pits Village, because of the blue clay that was found and mined around the area that the railway is now. This information is on a tourist sign on the entrance to the canal off the Manchester bound side of Manchester Road. The Rochdale Canal was routed through Castleton around the year 1800 and made Castleton one of the larger industrial areas in North West England. The canal granted jobs for hundreds of local residents, as it enabled the construction of several cotton mills. With the mills came the need for engineering and from 1892, Castleton was the home of Tweedales and Smalley who manufactured looms and textile machinery. Their Globe Works factory no longer exists, being part of the Woolworth's site. The Manchester and Leeds Railway Company (later the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) arrived in Castleton in 1839, and it was here that the line formerly diverged to Bury, Ramsbottom, Rawtenstall, Bacup and finally rejoined the main line at Rochdale. Castleton's railway area was one of the last mainstays of steam, being a huge resource of freight. Castleton Hall was occupied in the late nineteenth century by the \\"Joyful News Training Home and Mission\\", now Cliff College, which moved from Castleton to its current location at Calver in Derbyshire under the direction of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1904.About us: Cliff College, accessed 21 December 2016 In 1903, Whipp & Bourne Ltd. was founded by Samuel Whipp and Charles Bourne to manufacture electrical switchgear. The company closed its factory in Castleton, in 2007. In 1913, the Dunlop Rubber company began building a vast textile mill complex at Castleton. At its peak the mill employed over 3,000 workers. Most of the mill was demolished in 1979. Dunlop Textiles ceased trading in 2005. Governance Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire from a very early time, Castleton constituted a township within the ancient parish of Rochdale, in Salford hundred. During this time, Castleton stretched beyond what is now recognised as its boundaries, including with it the localities of Balderstone, Captain Fold, Hartly, Marland and Newburn. In 1865, part of Castleton was transferred to the newly created Municipal Borough of Rochdale, and following local government reorganisation in 1894, Castleton, though lying wholly within the administrative county of Lancashire, remained divided on this basis, forming two local government districts; \\"County Borough of Rochdale\\" and \\"Castleton- by-Rochdale\\". Castleton-by-Rochdale was renamed to \\"Castleton Urban District\\" in 1896, and four years later in 1900, was abolished (as part of a mutual agreement between local councillors) split and transferred to the neighbouring Rochdale and Heywood local government districts. As part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, the former county boroughs and urban districts were abolished, and Castleton was given to the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Economy Castleton was home to a large Woolworth's warehouse and office block, based on Royle Barn Road. The site is now closed following the failure of the Woolworths group. This mill is close to Arrow Mill, which is almost adjacent on Queensway. Royle Barn Road links Castleton with Sudden, emerging near the Tesco supermarket. Castleton is without any banks as they were all closed in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Carcraft was based there, on the former site of Asda but has now closed down. Landmarks The Church of St Martin's at Castleton, was completed in 1863. Castleton is home to St. Martin's C of E church. This example of religious Victorian architecture still stands tall to this very day. It was completed in 1863 and closed in 1991. It was refurbished in 2002/2003. Castleton's main apparent architecture is that of the old Victorian style terraces, however there are some renovated areas. Transport Castleton railway station lies on the Caldervale line. Castleton railway station serves the local community at Castleton, and lies on the Caldervale Line (which connects Castleton to Manchester and Leeds). Until March 2007, Castleton was home to a Corus steel works. It was built on the site of the former British Railways Castleton Central Materials Depot. In 1954 the Marshalling Ward consisted of four sidings between Castleton East Junction and Castleton North Junction. There was however a further seven sidings on the Down side and nine sidings on the Up side for wagon storage. Castleton was originally the junction for the branch line to Heywood, which was then extended through Bury to Bolton. A connecting line (known as the Bury South Junction Connecting Line or Bury East Fork) enabled trains off the Castleton to Bolton line to run northwards from Bury on the Clifton Junction to Accrington line. The Bacup line left the Clifton Junction to Accrington line at Stubbins Junction. Therefore, the remaining Castleton to Rawtenstall line is combination of remnants of several lines. The Rochdale Canal runs through Castleton, adjacent to the railway on one side, and Queensway on the other. The road passes over the canal via an old brick bridge, which was refurbished along with the canal. Castleton is also home to two of the canal's locks, as it goes on a down gradient through Slattocks and on its way into Manchester city centre. Sports Castleton has its own rugby league and football clubs. Rochdale Mayfield A.L.R.F.C. (formerly \\"Mayfield\\") play rugby league at Castleton Sports Centre. Rochdale Town F.C. (formerly Castleton Gabriels) are also based at the same ground. They currently play in the North West Counties Football League First Division. Education Castleton has three primary schools: Castleton County Primary School, St. Edward's Primary School and St. Gabriel's RC Primary School. Castleton Primary School is by far the most memorable by Castleton's older residents, as it was built in 1902 and opened to the public as 'Castleton Board School' in 1903. The school's external secondary assembly hall/sporting equipment annex was demolished in 2003 to make way for a better building.

The game is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Mario Tennis, and is the fourth game in the Mario Tennis series. Power Tennis was released for the GameCube in Japan and North America in late 2004, and in PAL regions in early 2005. The game was ported for the Wii in 2009 as part of the New Play Control! collection, and was also released as part of the Nintendo Selects collection in 2012. Power Tennis incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the Mario series. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants that feature different scoring formats and objectives. Other variants include \\"Gimmick\\" courts, thematic areas with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game has 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as \\"Power Shots\\". Power Tennis was developed simultaneously with Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, and the pair shared similar technology and concepts with each other during production. Such similarities include an emphasis on the Mario theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as \\"Ring Shot\\". The GameCube version was positively received in general, attaining an aggregate score of 81 percent from GameRankings and 80 out of 100 from Metacritic. Critics praised the game's depth and variety, but criticised the Power Shot animations, which could not be skipped. In 2010, it was included as one of the games in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. Gameplay Petey Piranha in the Tic-Tac-Glow Special Game Mario Power Tennis includes variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the Mario series. The range of courts includes the standard three types of tennis court, but consists predominantly of those themed upon games in the Mario series, known as \\"Gimmick\\" courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the Luigi's Mansion court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them. Although standard tennis is available, variants of the sport can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. \\"Ring Shot\\" involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot. The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equaled or surpassed. A similar mode, \\"Item Battle\\", involves the characters using items based on the Mario universe to interfere with each other's game and gain an advantage. The central mode of the game is \\"Tournament Mode\\", which comprises a set of events with accumulating difficulty. This set of events must be finished successfully to unlock playable characters. This mode can be completed either in \\"doubles\\" or \\"singles\\", and is divided into Gimmick courts and standard courts. An alternative to these are \\"Special Games\\", which involve the player trying to meet a tennis-related objective on a Gimmick court. These Special Games come in multiple forms, incorporating themes from past Nintendo games, such as \\"Tic-Tac-Glow\\", which requires the player to hit balls of water to liberate Shine Sprites trapped in dirt, a reference to Super Mario Sunshine. Power Tennis supports the option for four-player multiplayer, which can be accessed during \\"Exhibition Mode\\", the standard mode of play where the player can choose his or her opponents and the conditions of the match. Such options include the difficulty of the opponent, the court used, and the number of games and sets required to win the match. Power Tennis features 18 playable characters, all of whom derive from the Mario franchise. Many characters, such as Wario, had already appeared in the game's predecessor and several other Mario spin-offs, while this was the first appearance for Wiggler as a playable character. All of the characters are categorised into six groups that reflect their playing style: all-around, technical, power, speed, defensive, and tricky. Inherent in each character is a set of two unique moves known as \\"Power Shots\\". These powerful moves, which are accompanied with an animation each time they are triggered, incorporate the character's specific qualities. They can only be triggered occasionally in the match, but will usually result in defending or scoring a point, depending on the type of shot chosen. Generic tennis moves, such as slices, dropshots, and lobs, can be applied at any time in the match. Development Power Tennis was developed by Camelot Software Planning, with a team of approximately 30 people, headed by brothers Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi. The game was first unveiled in a 2002 issue of the Japanese magazine Famitsu, and was later presented at the E3 conference of 2004. Before release, the brothers discussed multiple developmental processes in an interview with Famitsu. Camelot had been working on a previous GameCube version of Mario Tennis, but discontinued the project and began again using ideas and technology from Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, which was being developed simultaneously with the game. Shugo noted that the original would have been more serious and contained deeper gameplay, but with fewer \\"Mario-esque\\" gimmicks. There was also a willingness not to update the graphics only without exploring advancements to concepts and gameplay, which Hiroyuki stated would be \\"unacceptable for a Mario game\\". Due to the success of its predecessor, the brothers felt pressure to make a game that was original and would not appear too similar to its predecessor on first sight. Following release, IGN interviewed Hiroyuki regarding the development of the game. He revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as \\"contributing quite a bit to the improvement of the game's graphics\\". Takahashi proceeded to explain why the role-playing game elements that were present in Mario Tennis were excluded from Power Tennis, stating that he felt they were more suitable for the \\"deep single-player experience\\" present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older Mario games and introduce new gamers to Mario games they may not have played. When questioned regarding difficulties in developing the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the Special Games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release, Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of lagging problems, stating \\"I don't think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied\\". Nintendo collaborated with the Lawn Tennis Association in 2005 to promote Power Tennis in the United Kingdom. The promotion featured on- site sampling and official Nintendo branding at various tennis events such as Wimbledon. The LTA's ACE Magazine advertised Power Tennis and featured competitions offering the game as a prize. Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players' habits and preferences in relation to tennis as a part of their Who Are You? campaign. Nintendo announced in 2008 that they would be re-releasing the title as part of their New Play Control! selection, which feature added Wii controls. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and optional Nunchuk attachment, allowing the player to trigger actions such as forehands and backhands by swinging the Remote like a tennis racket. It was released on January 15, 2009 in Japan and on March 2009 in other countries. It was later re-released in North America on June 10, 2012 along with Pikmin 2 as Nintendo Selects titles. Reception The GameCube version of Mario Power Tennis enjoyed a generally positive reception, with reviewers complimenting the variety of play and multiple minigames available. GameSpy's Raymond Padilla lauded the game's use of characters and the player categories, stating \\"When you put it all together, you have a broad cast of characters, each of whom offers a different feel.\\" Despite this, the Gimmick courts were labeled by Matt Casamassina as a \\"distraction\\" and \\"annoyance\\", although he acknowledged that some courts were better than others. Additionally, Nintendo World Report's Michael Cole thought that most players would revert to standard courts \\"after being 'unfairly defeated' by ghosts, paint, or some other trap.\\" Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell welcomed Power Tenniss style, which he said emphasised gameplay over simulation and realism. When comparing the game to its predecessor, reviewers praised Power Tennis for its incorporation of the Mario franchise in the different scenarios and courts. The gameplay features introduced to the game received a mixed response. IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that \\"they certainly don't make or break the experience.\\" The game's \\"Power Shots\\" was also met with an ambivalent reaction‚Äîthe shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that \\"it would have been nice if you could just skip past the animations and keep the wild moves.\\" In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the \\"predictable and basic\\" artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that \\"The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix.\\" The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball. Most critics praised Power Tenniss presentation, with reviewers noting the game's opening sequence especially. Nintendo World Report complimented the level of detail given to the themed locations and character animations, stating that it \\"[puts] even the Mario Kart series to shame.\\" IGN generally shared this view, although they criticised the background animations, commenting that \\"The crowds in particular are a repeating blob of the same sprites over and over\\". On the other hand, the audio received a mediocre response, despite the comical voice acting. Power Tennis sold 139,000 copies during its first week of release in Japan, and sold 377,000 copies altogether in the country from release to December 31, 2006. Power Tennis had sold 296,893 units in North America by January 31, 2005. The game was at fifth position in the Australian GameCube sales charts from October 16 to October 29, 2005. In spite of the mostly positive reception the GameCube version held, the reception for the Wii remake was mixed. It holds an average score of 65/100 and 68.19% at Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. While it has been praised for the original game's graphics holding up to current Wii games, many editors have found fault in the controls. IGN editor Mark Bozon criticized its motion controls, describing them as imprecise, for ruining a \\"great game\\". X-Play editor Dana Vinson similarly disliked the controls, also describing the act of releasing GameCube titles for the Wii with motion controls as being lazy. GamePro editor Dave Rudden criticized the game for adding multiple moves into Wii Remote motions, commenting that it would have to be \\"twice as responsive\\" for it to work. Eurogamer editor Oli Welsh criticized both the inaccurate controls and limited improvements, stating that Wii Sports is a superior alternative. While GameDaily editor Robert Workman criticized the motion controls, he stated that everything else works. He also describes it as being mildly enjoyable with three other friends. In spite of the negative reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, he felt that the multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.

They are named so because, just as the Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus, they tell the story of Odysseus's son Telemachus as he journeys from home for the first time in search of news about his missing father. The Telemachy as an introduction to the Odyssey The Odyssey is a nostos that recalls the story of Odysseus' journey home to Ithaca, finally completed twenty years after the Trojan War began. Odysseus, however, does not directly appear in the narrative until Book 5. Instead, the Telemachy's subject is the effect of Odysseus' absence on his family, Telemachus in particular. The first four books of the Odyssey give the reader a glimpse of the goings-on at the palace in Ithaca. There are a multitude of suitors vying for Penelope's hand in marriage, consuming the absent king's estate. They have been a terrible drain on the family's wealth, as they have been nearly permanent houseguests while Penelope put off her choice for three to four years. A brooding Telemachus wants to eject the suitors, and in fact announces his intention to do so; but he is not strong enough to act on the threat. Homer thus provides Telemachus with a motive for leaving Ithaca, and the reader with this portrait of Ithaca to place Odysseus' homecoming in context and to underscore the urgency of his journey.  Telemachus' Rites of Passage The Sorrow of Telemachus (Angelica Kauffman, 1783) Homeric scholarship generally recognizes the Telemachy as the story of its eponymous hero's journey from boyhood to manhood.See, e.g., the 2007 reprint of the Companion to the Richmond Lattimore translation; the 1993 Commentary to the Robert Fitzgerald translation; and James Morrison's 2007 commentary, A Companion to Homer's Odyssey. It is only after having gone through this journey that Telemachus will be equipped to help Odysseus kill the suitors in Book 22. His first step toward Homer's ideal of manhood is a figurative one: in Book 1 Penelope tries to dictate what songs a bard should sing for the suitors. Telemachus (345ff.) admonishes her, and directs her to go back to her room; this signals the first time that Telemachus asserts himself as the head of the household in the Odyssey. In Book 2 Telemachus further tries to assert his authority when he calls an Assembly and demands that the suitors leave his estate. But since Telemachus is, in his own words (61-2), \\"a weakling knowing nothing of valor,\\" the suitors refuse, blaming Penelope for their staying so long. Telemachus then announces his intention to visit Sparta and Pylos in search of news about his father. This first journey away from home is an important part of the figurative journey from boyhood to manhood. In Book 3 Telemachus is schooled in the ancient Greek social contract between hosts and their houseguests. The concept, called xenia, is simple: the host should offer the houseguest anything he wants, and the houseguest should not abuse this generosity, for he might find himself playing the part of host in the future. Nestor, the king of Pylos, exemplifies this social contract. Furthermore, Nestor's storytelling allows Homer to relate myths that fall outside of the Odyssey's purview. He reflects on the Trojan War, praising Odysseus for his cunning. Telemachus begins to learn and appreciate what kind of man his father was. The story Nestor tells of Orestes in particular serves as a model for Telemachus to emulate: just as Orestes killed the overbearing suitor who occupied his father Agamemnon's estate, so should Telemachus kill the suitors and reclaim his own father's estate. Telemachus in the palace of Menelaus (c. 1886) In Book 4 Telemachus visits Menelaus in Sparta. Through the story-telling of Menelaus, Homer further narrates myths of the Trojan War that are not strictly the Odyssey's purview. Menelaus tells Telemachus of his own detour in Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War, during which he learned that Odysseus is still alive, a virtual captive of the nymph Calypso. His wife Helen recalls one of Odysseus' exploits during the war, which prompts Menelaus to tell his own story about Odysseus' heroism in the war. These tales of bravery and cunning both further educate Telemachus about his father, and serve as further examples of heroism to which he should aspire. The story of Orestes is revisited, again, to inspire Telemachus to take action against the suitors. Telemachus takes his own steps toward manhood when he leaves Sparta. Whereas he arrived at Pylos afraid to even speak to Nestor, upon leaving Menelaus he has enough confidence in himself to ask for a gift more appropriate for an inhabitant of rocky Ithaca. Menelaus obliges, and exchanges the chariot and team of horses he had given him for a wine bowl made by Hephaestus. Telemachus then begins his journey back home. But in Ithaca, the suitors have decided to ambush and kill Telemachus before he reaches his (669) \\"measure of manhood\\" and begin making trouble for them: in Book 2 Telemachus is considered a boy who poses no threat; by the end of Book 4 they fear his becoming a man who could stand up to them. The Telemachy abruptly draws to a close with this cliffhanger, the Suitors setting an ambush for Telemachus at a harbour. Athena, disguised as Mentor, and Telemachus. Typically, in the hero's journey he will receive occasional aid from a mentor figure. In the Odyssey, Athena serves as mentor to both Odysseus and Telemachus. In Book 1 she visits Telemachus disguised as the mortal Mentes to spur the young man to action. She alternately advises Telemachus in the guise of a man actually named Mentor‚Äîhence the word \\"mentor\\" in English.Merriam-Webster definition of Mentor The names Mentes and Mentor actually amount to the same thing, etymologically: one who instills menos (strength, passion, resolve).Tuft's Classics Lexical entry for meŒΩos Capstone to Telemachy Near the end of the Odyssey, Telemachus demonstrates his decisiveness and independence by hanging the disloyal women slaves, instead of killing them by sword, for the sake of his honor. Foreshadowing in the Telemachy The Orestes paradigm treated above is perhaps the most overt example of foreshadowing events in the Odyssey's later books. The stories told about Odysseus serve a similar purpose. In the Telemachy both Nestor and Menelaus praise Odysseus for his cunning. In telling of his own detour in Egypt, Menelaus emphasizes how the use of cunning and subterfuge were instrumental in his return to Sparta. It was only by hiding under a seal skin that he was able to ambush and capture Proteus, the only one who can direct Menelaus how to reach home. Although the scheme was not of Menelaus' devising, it does demonstrate that while the battlefield inspires bravery from its heroes, wily cunning also has its place when the situation demands. These recollections of stealth and subterfuge point to the tactics that Odysseus will eventually employ upon his return to Ithaca. Notes Category:Odyssey ","title":"Telemachy"},{"id":"1109485","text":"\\"Market Square Heroes\\" is the debut single by the British neo-progressive rock band Marillion, released in 1982 with \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\" as the B-side. The 12-inch single included an additional track, the 17:15-minute-long \\"Grendel\\", making it an EP in terms of overall length. Themes The A-side is an anthemic rock song whose lyric vaguely describes the rise of civil unrest under some charismatic leader in the face of increasing unemployment; the original title was \\"UB 2,000,001\\". According to Marillion's singer and lyricist Fish, the \\"market square hero\\" is a \\"would-be revolutionary with all the necessary charisma and presence of a leader without direction or goals, just a sense of frustration and anger\\". The track was the band's \\"first attempt at deliberately writing a hit record and a 'simple' rock song to juxtapose against our meandering but dynamic 'epics'.\\" Members of the band have attributed the inspiration behind the main character in the song lyrics to a person they knew in Aylesbury who went by the nickname of 'Brick'. In a 2009 interview, Mark Kelly stated: \\"I don't know whether Brick was a leftie, a militant or a skinhead but he was the inspiration for the character singing, \\"I'm a Market Square Hero\\" Fish made reference to this theme and introduced Brick as a \\"leftie hero\\" before he performed the song with his former Marillion bandmates in Aylesbury at the 'Hobble on the Cobbles' concert in 2007. Brick died in 2011. B-sides Musically, \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\" (the first song co-written by keyboardist Mark Kelly) and \\"Grendel\\" are more typical of the progressive rock style. \\"Grendel\\" is a long and complex composition which has drawn frequent (mostly unfavourable) comparisons with \\"Supper's Ready\\" by Genesis. As Fish himself admitted later: > \\"We were concerned about the similarity to the lengthy composition by > Genesis called 'Supper's Ready' which also meandered and burst into > sections, the end one in particular, which would add conviction to the many > critics opinions that Marillion were more than influenced by Genesis.\\" Inspired by the John Gardner novel Grendel (1971), the lyric looks at the Beowulf myth from the perspective of the monster. Neither Marillion nor Fish have ever played the track live after 1983. In spite (or possibly because) of this, it has developed into a cult favourite among die-hard fans; it is not uncommon to hear someone in the audience yell \\"Grendel!\\" at Marillion's or Fish's concerts even in the late 2000s. In 2008, on the 25th anniversary of the release of Marillion's debut album, their founder and first drummer Mick Pointer (later with Arena) who had been dismissed from the band after the 1983 tour, formed a band which took that tour's setlist and a detailed recreation of its stage show back on the road as \\"Script for a Jester's Tour\\". This band, which makes heavy use of a slightly modified version of Marillion's classic- era logo and is sometimes promoted as \\"Mick Pointer's Marillion\\" (despite Pointer being the only former Marillion member in the lineup), continues to play occasional shows which always include \\"Grendel\\", \\"Market Square Heroes\\" and \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\". Having categorically refused to play \\"Grendel\\" again for almost 30 years, Fish announced in May 2012 that he would be performing \\"Grendel\\", as a one-off event, at a fan club convention to be held in Leamington Spa in October 2012. On 20 October 2012, Fish fulfilled his vow by playing \\"Grendel\\" live at the Leamington Spa event.adperry0 (2012-10-20). Fish playing \\"Grendel\\" live at Leamington Spa on 20 October 2012. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXGLeGKhDWw. He performed it on the second day of the convention as well, October 21st, as an encore. https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/fish/2012/the-assembly-leamington-spa- england-43dd4b37.html Production The record was produced by David Hitchcock, who had incidentally also produced the Genesis album Foxtrot with \\"Supper's Ready\\" on it. Hitchcock was also contracted to produce Marillion's upcoming debut album, but was heavily injured in a car accident when he drove home in a state of physical exhaustion after finishing work on the single. EMI used this occasion to convince the band to replace him with Nick Tauber, a more \\"modern\\" producer best known for his work with Toyah. Cover art The cover art was designed by Mark Wilkinson, who went on to create all Marillion artwork until 1988 and most of Fish's solo artwork after that. The cover introduced two distinctive visual elements that would identify the band in the years to come: the figure of the \\"Jester\\" and the logo, designed by Jo Mirowski. Variations The radio edit replaces the line \\"I am your Antichrist\\" with \\"I am your battle priest\\". A limited edition (2,500 copies) picture disk of the 12\\" for \\"Market Square Heroes\\" was available through an offer made by The Web, Marillion's fan club. Reception The single did not enter the upper reaches of the UK singles charts, peaking at no. 60; however, sales remained stable for some time due to people backtracking on the strength of later, more successful releases. The song came fourth in Kerrang! magazine's Singles of the Year 1982. Subsequent releases None of the tracks on this release were included on Marillion's debut album Script for a Jester's Tear, which appeared in early 1983. Re-recorded versions of \\"Market Square Heroes\\" and \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\" would form the B-side to the 1984 single \\"Punch and Judy\\". These re-recorded versions would later be included on the 1988 compilation album B'Sides Themselves, along with \\"Grendel\\"; \\"Market Square Heroes\\" is also on the 1997 compilation The Best of Both Worlds. The original single versions of \\"Market Square Heroes\\" and \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\" would eventually become available on CD in 1997, when EMI released them on the bonus CD of the remastered Script for a Jester's Tear album.

The first time that a version of \\"Market Square Heroes\\" would become available on an album was on the 1984 live album Real to Reel, although a live version of \\"Three Boats Down from the Candy\\", recorded at the 1982 Reading Festival, was included on the \\"Reading Rock\\" festival album. All three tracks also appear on the albums Early Stages (2008) and Recital of the Script (2009), and \\"Market Square Heroes\\" is on Live from Loreley (2009). On 26 August 2007, Fish performed \\"Market Square Heroes\\" at the Hobble on the Cobbles festival in the market square of Aylesbury, the original \\"setting\\" of the song in the town where Marillion was formed. The other members of the band (except singer Steve Hogarth) joined Fish on stage for this song.

Cabrilla (SS-288) was launched 24 December 1942 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. L. B. Combs; commissioned 24 May 1943, Commander Douglas Thompson Hammond in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet. Cabrilla arrived at Pearl Harbor 30 August 1943, and on 12 September cleared on the first of eight war patrols. After a daring exploit in which four Filipino guerrillas were taken off Negros Island, Cabrilla completed her patrol at Fremantle, Australia, her base for the next five patrols. During her second patrol, Cabrilla laid mines in the Gulf of Siam, and sank her first Japanese merchantman, then returned to Fremantle to prepare for her third patrol, a reconnaissance of Sunda Strait. Her fourth and fifth patrols, off Makassar, and in the Celebes and Sulu Seas, found her again striking with telling results against Japanese merchant shipping. Most successful of her patrols was the sixth, in the South China Sea and off Luzon from 13 September to 25 October 1944. During this period, she sank a total of 24,557 tons of shipping, including a 10,059-ton tanker. Cabrilla made her seventh war patrol in vicious weather in the Kurile Islands of northern Japan, and her last patrol found her on lifeguard duty for aviators downed at sea while carrying out attacks on Japan. Homeward-bound after 2 arduous years, Cabrilla cleared Fremantle 31 August 1945 for the States. Following overhaul at Philadelphia, she sailed for the Canal Zone for exercises (19 February ‚Äì 17 March 1946), then underwent preinactivation overhaul at Philadelphia. Cabrilla was placed out of commission in reserve 7 August 1946 at the Naval Submarine Base New London, CT, and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Cabrilla was recommissioned and redesignated Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-288, in 1962. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1968 and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register. Cabrilla was subsequently designated to be a museum ship and temporarily opened as such at Galveston Texas. However, delays in preparing a permanent berth and the poor material condition of the sub compelled the memorial organizers to exchange Cabrilla for the . In January 1971 Cabrilla was returned to the Navy, which sold her for scrapping in April 1972. Cabrilla received six battle stars for World War II service. Of her eight patrols, six were designated as \\"Successful War Patrols\\". She is credited with having sunk a total of 38,767 tons of shipping.

ABRSM is one of five examination boards accredited by Ofqual to award graded exams and diploma qualifications in music within the UK's National Qualifications Framework (along with the London College of Music, Rockschool Ltd, Trinity College London, and the Music Teachers' Board). 'The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music' was established in 1889 and rebranded as ABRSM in 2009. The clarifying strapline \\"the exam board of the Royal Schools of Music\\" was introduced in 2012. The Royal Schools referred to in ABRSM's title are: * The Royal Academy of Music * The Royal College of Music * The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland * The Royal Northern College of Music More than 600,000 candidates take ABRSM exams each year in over 93 countries. ABRSM also provides a publishing house for music which produces syllabus booklets, sheet music and exam papers and runs professional development courses and seminars for teachers. ABRSM is one of the UK's 200 largest charitable organisations ranked by annual expenditure.Charities Direct: Top 500 Charities ‚Äì Expenditure For the year ended 31 January 2014, income was ¬£42.9 million and expenditure was ¬£39.7 million. Graded music exams Graded music exams provide a structured framework for progression from beginner to advanced musician. In the United Kingdom, ABRSM graded examinations are QCA-accredited at three levels in the National Qualifications Framework: Grades 1‚Äì3 at Level 1 (SQA: National 5, GCSE: Grades 1‚Äì3), Grades 4‚Äì5 at Level 2 (SQA: Higher (G4) and Advanced Higher (G5), GCSE: grades 4‚Äì9) and Grades 6‚Äì8 at Level 3 (SQA: Advanced Higher, GCE: A-Level). Most subjects are offered from Grades 1‚Äì8 and have three standards of pass: a straight pass, a pass with merit and a pass with distinction. Candidates may enter any Practical or Music Theory exam grade without having taken any other, though there is a requirement to have passed Grade 5 Theory or Grade 5 Practical Musicianship or Grade 5 in a solo Jazz subject before Grade 6‚Äì8 Practical exams can be taken. Passes in Grades 6‚Äì8 in either Music Theory or Practical exams may be used as part of the UCAS tariff in obtaining a university place in Britain. The four types of graded exam are as follows: Practical exams These are by far the most commonly taken exams. Available for over 35 instruments, these exams incorporate four individual components: * Set pieces. The student is required to play three pieces prepared beforehand. These pieces are selected from the current syllabus for the instrument and grade, usually one piece from each of the groups A, B and C. Group A usually features Baroque and early Classical repertoire, Group B late Classical and Romantic, and Group C 20th century and contemporary music, encouraging the student to select a balanced programme with music in a range of styles and periods. For most instruments (obviously excluding the piano itself), some or all of the pieces are played with piano accompaniment. Each piece is marked out of 30. The pass mark is 20. * Scales. Various scales, arpeggios, dominant and diminished 7ths and, for Grades 1‚Äì4 only (Grades 1 & 2 for Piano), broken chords, are examined, according to the grade of difficulty. Scales are marked out of 21. The pass mark is 14. * Sight reading. The student is presented with an unseen piece, has up to 30 seconds to prepare, and then must play to the best of his or her ability. Sight-reading is marked out of 21. The pass mark is 14. * Aural. Various exercises are played by the examiner and the student is required to demonstrate skills in listening to and analysing music, for example clapping the rhythm or singing the melody. At higher grades, students are expected to comment on features of a short piece played by the examiner, including dynamics, phrasing and style and period. Aural is marked out of 18. The passing mark is 12. The exams are marked out of 150, where 100 is a pass, 120 a pass with merit, and 130 a distinction. Students are not required to pass every component of the exam: they only need to have a total mark above 100 to achieve the grade. As the passing marks of all the components add to 100, it is not possible for a student to pass all the components but fail the exam. Music Theory exams Music Theory is examined through written papers. Papers last between one and a half and three hours depending on the grade. They are marked out of 100, where 66 is a pass, 80 a merit, and 90 a distinction. Candidates are required to pass Grade 5 Theory, Grade 5 Practical Musicianship or Grade 5 in a solo Jazz subject in order to progress to Practical exams at Grades 6, 7 and 8. They are also required to have passed Grade 5 Theory to be able to do advanced Theory exams. Practical Musicianship In a Practical Musicianship exam candidates demonstrate their understanding of melody, harmony, rhythm and form by responding to questions about music and by singing or playing an instrument of their choice in a series of tests. This exam is unaccredited and is used as an internal assessment prerequisite. Jazz exams Jazz exams (Grades 1‚Äì5) are available for a variety of instruments. They are marked in the same way as Practical exams. However, many of the pieces include large improvisational sections, where the instrumentalist is required to fill in the empty bars with their own melody to fit the standard chord progression listed above.  Music Medals  Music Medals\\"Welcome to Music Medals!\\" are QCA‚Äìaccredited music assessments and teaching resources aimed at younger, group-taught learners. Music Medals are distinct from graded music exams in that no external examiners are involved and the initial assessment is made by the teacher. ABRSM diploma, licentiate diploma and fellowship ABRSM offers diplomas in three disciplines: *Music Performance *Music Direction *Instrumental/Vocal teaching For each discipline there are four levels of award: *ARSM (Associate of the Royal Schools of Music) *DipABRSM (Diploma of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) *LRSM (Licentiate of the Royal Schools of Music) *FRSM (Fellowship of the Royal Schools of Music) These are professional qualifications, and entitle the recipient to append the letters after his or her name. The prerequisite for ARSM and DipABRSM is Grade 8 in the instrument offered, and LRSM and FRSM require the previous diploma in the same discipline to have been passed. In addition, for the Instrumental/Vocal Teaching discipline, candidates for DipABRSM must have Grade 6 Theory, and Grade 8 Music Theory for LRSM. These professional qualifications are recognized by US Universities and Colleges. Lipscomb University uses these diplomas in their Bmus program. DipABRSM in teaching earns 3 credits in MA music programs in some institutions in the US Music performance The examinations for DipABRSM, LRSM and FRSM are divided as follows: *Section 1: Recital *Section 2: Viva Voce and Quick Study Candidates perform various pieces from a selected list and may select works other than those listed but should not exceed one third of the entire recital programme. Recital time for DipABRSM is 35 minutes, ARSM is 30 minutes (performance only), LRSM is 40 minutes while for FRSM the time range is around 50 minutes. Before the viva voce, the candidate must submit written programme notes on the day of the exam (for FRSM, the written submission should be submitted with the application form, in the form of an essay with in-depth analysis and requires sophisticated knowledge of the history, context of the composer as well as the era in which the works were composed) which should include background information as well as sufficient information and analysis of the works that are performed. The examiner(s) would engage in a conversation with the candidate concerning the notes submitted as well as other related questions that would allow the candidate to demonstrate his or her knowledge as a professional musician. The Quick Study is a short piece with an equivalent difficulty of an ABRSM Grade 6 piece (for DipABRSM), an ABRSM Grade 7 piece (for LRSM) and an ABRSM Grade 8 piece (for FRSM). The candidate is required to sightread the piece and may be asked questions about the technical aspects and style of the selection. Instrumental/vocal teaching Candidates are expected to discuss their teaching materials and approach, and at LRSM must provide a video recording of their teaching. At DipABRSM candidates are assessed on their understanding of the principles of teaching up to Grade 5 level. At LRSM candidates are expected to demonstrate skills in teaching up to Grade 8 level, and for FRSM, up to DipABRSM level. The written submissions and Viva Voce are considerably longer than those for Music Performance. While there is no Recital section, candidates are expected to include demonstrations of passages in repertoire as part of their Viva Voce (e.g. candidates for FRSM Teaching are expected to be able to give authoritative demonstrations of sections of repertoire that are of a level to be performed in a DipABRSM exam). The Quick Study is the same as for the Performance diploma at the same level. Teacher training Since 1995, the CT ABRSM (Certificate of Teaching) designed specifically for music teachers has been offered in addition to the diplomas, albeit as a separate qualification. In 2010, the new CT ABRSM Plus, which combined the DipABRSM and old CT ABRSM, was launched to give teachers access to the DipABRSM. From September 2013, the CT ABRSM Plus stopped being offered in the UK or Singapore for financial reasons. The CT ABRSM Plus is now only offered in Hong Kong. There are also numerous short courses and seminars on music teaching, accompaniment and syllabus instruction available to teachers. ABRSM publications ABRSM published its first books in 1918 and its publishing department was first set up in 1921 and was designed to provide suitable music for examinations, performance editions of popular works and new instructional compositions. One of the original editors was Sir Donald Tovey, who wrote informative notes on the music which are still highly regarded today. ABRSM (Publishing) Ltd. was established as a separate company in 1985. ABRSM continues to produce copies of popular works, along with commentaries from distinguished editors. It publishes contemporary music in its \\"Spectrum\\" series of books, and also issues a variety of publications for beginners and younger instrumentalists such as the 'Time Pieces' books for a variety of instruments and 'Joining the Dots' for piano, guitar and violin players. ABRSM digital resources Since 2009 ABRSM has produced several practice applications to support teachers and students: * Melody Writer \\\\- a tool designed to help improve melody writing and music theory knowledge and understanding * Aural Trainer \\\\- an iPhone app that helps students practice their aural skills * Speedshifter \\\\- a practice tool that allows students to vary the speed of audio without altering the pitch * Piano Practice Partner \\\\- an app for iOS and Android devices that helps students practice exam pieces for piano at Grades 1 to 3. Piano Practice Partner plays one hand so that students can play the other as they learn. History The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music was founded in 1889 when Alexander Mackenzie, then the Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, and George Grove, founding Director of the Royal College of Music, decided that both institutions should combine to form an associated examining board to run joint local exams. The first syllabi were published in 1890 for Piano, Organ, Violin, Cello and Harp, with Viola, Double Bass and woodwind instruments added the following year. Originally, the ABRSM had only two grades and were the equivalent of the current grades 6 and 7. Due to the popular demand for beginner grades, the present structure (grades 1-8) was introduced in 1933. In 1947, the Royal Manchester College of Music (merged to form the present Royal Northern College of Music) and Royal Scottish Academy of Music (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) joined ABRSM. Since the post-World War II years, the ABRSM saw an increase in overseas exam applications. The curriculum also expanded, with the addition of Guitar, Harpsichord, Voice, (with the option of specific exams for \\"musical theatre\\" singing at grades 1-3), percussion, Recorder and all brass instruments. The 1990s saw percussion and jazz added to the syllabus. The current diploma exams were introduced in 2000, as well as similar exams for instructors and teachers. In 2009 the ABRSM celebrated its 120th anniversary and of the 93 countries in which the association offers music examination support, they have been in Sri Lanka when it was known as Ceylon since 1898; in Malta from 1903; New Zealand (1908); Jamaica (1909); Barbados (1926); Antigua (1941); Kenya (1949); Hong Kong, Malaysia and Cyprus (1951); Brunei and Mauritius (1959); Switzerland (1961); Netherlands (1975); Indonesia (1977); Abu Dhabi (1981); Thailand (1982); USA and Canada (1986); Sweden (1988); Turkey and Portugal (1990); and Serbia (2006).

North Stradbroke Island (Jandai: Minjerribah), colloquially Straddie or North Straddie, is an island that lies within Moreton Bay in the Australian state of Queensland, southeast of the centre of Brisbane. Before 1896 the island was part of the Stradbroke Island. In that year a storm separated it from South Stradbroke Island, forming the Jumpinpin Channel. The Quandamooka people are the traditional owners of North Stradbroke island. The island is divided into four localities: Dunwich, Amity and Point Lookout are small localities centred on the towns of the same name, while the remainder of the island is in the locality of North Stradbroke Island. All the localities are within the City of Redland. At , it is the second largest sand island in the world. On the island there are three small towns, a number of lakes and beaches along most of the seaward coastline with rocky outcrops at Point Lookout. An Aboriginal presence on the island has been long and ongoing, resulting in a successful native title determination. Tourism is a major and growing industry on the island. The island has been the site for sand mining for more than sixty years. Tourism and currently mining are the island's main industries.  Geography and ecology  North Stradbroke Island is the second largest sand island in the world. North Stradbroke, South Stradbroke and Moreton Island act as a barrier between Moreton Bay and the Coral Sea. The island is about long and wide with an area of roughly and a maximum elevation of . The climate of North Stradbroke Island is sub-tropical with warm, moist summers and mild winters. Average annual rainfall is and mean annual maximum temperature is . The population of the island at the was 2026, comprising 883 in Dunwich, 678 in Point Lookout, 348 in Amity, and 117 elsewhere on the island. The number of people on the island swells significantly during the holiday season. The island is only accessible by vehicular or passenger ferries leaving from Cleveland. There are three townships on the island. Dunwich is the largest and has most of the island's services including a school, medical centre, local museum and the University of Queensland's Moreton Bay Research Station. Point Lookout (referred to locally as 'the point') is on the surf side of the island and is the major tourist destination in the holiday season. The third is Amity Point which is much smaller and a popular fishing spot on the island. Flinders Beach is a small settlement of mostly holiday houses located on the main beach between Amity and Point Lookout. Blue Lake The whole of the island is part of the Redland City local government area, and is incorporated as part of Division 2.Divisional Boundaries 2011. Redland City Council. Retrieved 21 February 2012. The two largest lakes on the island are Brown Lake and Blue Lake. In January 2014, about 60% of the island's bushland was consumed by bushfires, later to regenerate.  Beaches  View south from Point Lookout of Main Beach, 2014 Five main beaches provide fishing, surfing and water opportunities on North Stradbroke Island. These are Main Beach which is long and good for surfing, Cylinder Beach which is a protected swimming beach with a smaller swell, Home Beach which is popular with swimmers, Frenchmans Beach/Deadmans Beach with rock pools but no lifesaving service and Flinders Beach which offers good swimming and beach camping. Main Beach is also the location of the entry to the Keyhole Track, which is one of the top 4WD tracks near Brisbane. The entrance is near Point Lookout to the south.  Lakes, springs and wetlands  View of the wetland from the high dune escarpment North Stradbroke Island has over 100 freshwater lakes and wetlands and contains significant groundwater resources which are accessed by local communities and a sand mining company, Sibelco Australia. In addition, a significant volume of groundwater is exported to the mainland. There is a higher number of wetlands that have been in existence since the last ice age than anywhere else on the Australian mainland. While there is the potential for expanded groundwater use, because so little is known about groundwater- dependent water bodies and ecosystems any expanded groundwater use is suspended. Dependent ecosystems include freshwater and estuarine wetlands, mangrove and paperbark communities, and surface-water fauna. Many of the wetlands are places for threatened migratory wading birds, including 34 species listed by JAMBA and CAMBA Moreton Bay Ramsar area, Marine, migratory (EPBC Act).  Blue Lake  Blue Lake, one of the largest lakes on the island, is protected within the Naree Budjong Djara National Park and is of cultural significance to the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island. It is a spring-fed lake relying on the stable aquifer feeding it. This stable hydrology means it has been untouched by climate change and appears to be in the same condition as it was 7,500 years ago. Blue Lake has been an important climate 'refuge' for the freshwater biota of the region, and with appropriate management, the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds, possibly thousands of years to come.  Brown Lake  Brown Lake is a perched lake which retains its water due to a layer of leaves lining the lake floor and is of cultural significance to the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island. The precipitated matter eventually forms an impermeable layer, preventing water from percolating to the watertable.  Eighteen Mile Swamp  Aerial view of the 18 Mile Swamp and the Enterprise sand mine operating close by The Eighteen Mile Swamp is the largest of its kind in the world and, in particular, is a fine and extensive representation of a coastal freshwater swamp. It is unusual for its size and dimensions (very long and narrow), covering and is considered to be very young (500-6,000 years) compared with similar swamps. On 27 March 2011, the area was declared a national park, named Naree Budjong Djara National Park, My Mother Earth, by the Quandamooka people, the Traditional Owners of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), who are engaged in its joint management with the Queensland State government. The wetland is in close proximity to the extensive Enterprise Mine. The 18-mile swamp is home to many endangered, rare species, including the vulnerable Cryptocarya foetida whose habitat is the notophyll vine forest found at the foot and lower slope of parabolic high dunes on the west of the wetland. These high dunes on the west of Eighteen mile swamp provide excellent examples of long parabolic dunes migrating across North Stradbroke island from the south- east to the north-west. This migration has buried earlier positions of the west coast escarpment to form complex hydrological systems with the ancient dunes (estimated at up to 300,000 years old). No comparative examples of the phenomenon are seen on Moreton and Fraser Islands.  Myora Springs and Myora Creek Swamp  Myora Springs is a unique wetland site on the North West side of North Stradbroke Island, of particular cultural significance to the Quandamooka people as a sacred gathering site, and is also a declared fish habitat area. Myora Springs is known to be essential habitat for the vulnerable water mouse (Xeromys myoides) and the endangered Swamp Orchid (Phaius australis).  Lake Kounpee  Another perched lake, Lake Kounpee was partially drained after sand mining operations breached the impervious layer in 1987. CRL spent over $300,000 in the 10 years following this in attempts to fix the damage, and now acknowledge they can not repair the damage to the lake ‚Äì \\"turning a clear freshwater lake into a reedy waterhole\\".  Other lakes and wetlands  Other perched lakes include Black Snake Lagoon, Ibis lagoon (whose melaleuca community is unique in structure and floristics from other melaleuca areas on the island), Welsby Lagoon, Native Companion Lagoon and the ephemeral Tortoise Lagoon within the Naree Budjong Djara National Park. Amity swamp suffered, in 1991, when up to 100,000 litres of diesel spilled from the sand mining company, Consolidated Rutile Limited [CRL]. This was not reported until 1994, the same year CRL was awarded a commendation in the inaugural State Government Award for Environmental Excellence. It was not until 1997 that the incident was acknowledged in CRL's Annual Report stating that the spill was expected to be cleared by 1999 ‚Äì eight years after it occurred. The sand mining company was never fined by the Department of Mines and Energy for these environmental incidents and continues operating. Flinders Swamp and its drainage lines is home to the rare acid frog (Litotia cooloolensis) and the area includes habitats for relict populations of the burrowing skink (Anomalopus truncatus). View of the Sibelco-owned Yarraman mine site.The Keyholes are a series of clear, freshwater lakes at the northern end of the 18 Mile Swamp popular with visiting canoeists. As the Yarraman Mine is now operating close to these lakes, public access has been closed, as it is a prohibited mining area.  Fauna  Wallum Sedgefrog is a 'vulnerable' species living on Straddie North Stradbroke Island is home to rare, vulnerable, endangered and near threatened animals. Examples include: # Migratory wading birds, including 34 species listed by JAMBA and CAMBA Moreton Bay Ramsar area. # Wallum Froglet (Crinia tinnula): These occur at Dunwich, Amity, Yarraman Lakes, Blue Lake, Eighteen Mile Swamp, Brown Lake, Amity Swamp, Tortoise Lagoon and Flinders Beach Wetlands. # Cooloola Sedge Frog (Litoria cooloolensis): These occur at Eighteen Mile Swamp, north of the causeway, Brown Lake, Dunwich, Point Lookout, Tortoise Lagoon, Blue Lake, Welsby Lagoon and Yarraman Lakes. The population of L. cooloolensis on North Stradbroke Island has also been called Litoria sp. cf. cooloolensis (North Stradbroke Is) and may represent an unnamed species endemic to the island, as it is genetically distinct and has a different mating call from the other population of L. cooloolensis on the Sunshine Coast. # Oxleyan Pygmy Perch (Nannoperca oxleyana): There are two genetically distinct populations, east and west, but in very low abundance. The eastern population is at Eighteen Mile Swamp and Blue Lake, though only one specimen was collected there by McGregor et al. in 2008. The western population is at Little Canalpin Creek.  Flora  There are 780 plant species recorded for the island, 599 native and 181 introduced species. Of these 14 species are classified as threatened or near threatened species under the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992, two of them are endemic to the island. Examples include: # Notophyll vine forest on parabolic high dunes: These occur on the foot and lower slope of high dunes on the west of Eighteen Mile Swamp, Swan Bay area and are the habitat for rare and threatened flora including Cryptocarya foetida. # Acacia baueri Bauer's Wattle [vulnerable]: These occur in seasonally waterlogged sands in wallum areas such as Canalpin Swamp and Eighteen Mile Swamp. # Durringtonia paludosa Durringtonia [near threatened]: These occur in Myora Swamp and Eighteen Mile Swamp, and, in 1993 Bostock and Thomas recorded the first specimens on NSI since 1935. # Phaius australis Swamp Orchid [endangered]: These occur at Flinders Beach Wetlands, Myora and Eighteen Mile swamps. # Thelypteris confluens Soft Swamp Fern [vulnerable]: These occur found in permanently swamp areas associated with species of Baumea and Cladium at Flinders Beach Wetlands and Eighteen Mile Swamp. # Arthraxon hispidus Hairy-joint grass [vulnerable] may no longer be present on the island. # Blandifordia grandiflora Christmas Bells [endangered] # Eleocarpus difformis Underwater Spikerush [endangered ‚Äì Endemic] # Goodenia arenicola [presumed extinct] # Olearia hygrophila Swamp Daisy [endangered ‚Äì Endemic] # Persicaria elatior Smartweed [vulnerable] # Phaius bernaysi Swamp Orchid [endangered] likely to be a yellow colour form of P. australis, it is likely that no mainland populations remain of this colour form. # Pterostylis nigricans Brownhood Orchid [near threatened] # Schoenus scabripes Bog Rush [near threatened] # Thesium australe Toadflax [vulnerable]  History  North Stradbroke Island has the earliest evidence of human occupation in south-east Queensland. The Aboriginal (Jandai) name of the island is Minjerribah (\\"island in the sun\\"). The first recorded visit by a European was by Matthew Flinders in 1802, who was seeking a source of fresh water. He was impressed by the Aboriginal people's health and hospitality. Local historian, Thomas Welsby, records an Aboriginal oral tradition that there was earlier contact with non- indigenous people. This concerns two survivors who walked into one of the Aboriginal camps after their ship was wrecked on the ocean side of the island. The tradition states that one of the men was named Juan and the other Woonunga. In 1890 a member of the Campbell family, one of Stradbroke's oldest mixed blood families, told Welsby that the remains of the ship were still visible in the 18 Mile Swamp and that the remains were of English oak. This story gives rise to a local legend that the remains of a Spanish or Portuguese shipwreck known as the Stradbroke Island Galleon exist somewhere in the 18 Mile Swamp. Early Moreton Bay, Thomas Welsby, Outridge (1907) In 1823 three shipwrecked sailors from Sydney, Thomas Pamphlett, John Finnegan and Richard Parsons, spent time on the island after they were washed ashore on Moreton Island. The local Aboriginal people supplied them with food and shelter and even gave them a canoe to help them on their way. Their experiences prompted interest in the Moreton Bay area and in 1827 Governor Ralph Darling came from Sydney aboard HMS Rainbow, giving the names Stradbroke Island and Dunwich in honour of the commander of the ship, Captain Henry John Rous, whose family held the titles Earl of Stradbroke and Viscount Dunwich Louise T.

Myora Mission was established as a mission station in 1892 at Moongalba. It became an Aboriginal reserve and \\"industrial and reform school\\" in 1896, was used as a source of cheap labour, and eventually closed in 1943. North Stradbroke Island's most famous local was Oodgeroo Noonuccal, formerly known as Kath Walker, the Aboriginal poet and native-rights campaigner. She was one of the prime movers of the movement that led to the 1997 landmark agreement between the local government council and the aboriginal people of the area that claimed rights over the island and parts of Moreton Bay.

Retrieved 16 February 2012. Consolidated Rutile Limited (CRL), an Australian public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, took over these sand mining operations in 1966 and operated two of Stradbroke's three sand mines.

From 2001, the third mine, a silica sand mine, has been operated by Unimin Australia Limited, part of mining multi-national SCR-Sibelco, a company privately owned by the Belgian Emsens family. In 1998, Iluka Resources Limited, a publicly listed Australian company, acquired majority interest in CRL. Unimin Australia Limited acquired Iluka Resources majority interest in CRL holdings in 2009, and, in December 2010, the company changed its name to Sibelco Australia (after its Belgian parent company). Iluka Resources remains the overseas selling agent for mineral sands from Sibelco Australia's Enterprise and Yarraman mines.Sibelco Australia. Retrieved 27 August 2013. Mining began in the 1950s on the beachfront and this caused minimal disruption to the environment. However, as mining moved into the interior of the island in the late 1960s and increased in scale and size in the 1970s, the impact on Stradbroke's ecosystem increased with Consolidated Rutile Limited (CRL) starting dredge-mining on Stradbroke's high dunes. There are several accounts from sand mining employees of unusual artifacts being found during dredging operations. Dredge mining involves levelling the high dunes and stripping vegetation to create the dredge pond and this dramatically changed the landscape of Stradbroke. The dredge is continually moving, leaving the tailings sand, so, although the mined dunes are revegetated and stabilised, the original ecology of the Island cannot be replaced. As an alternative, development of the island for seaside residential use was mooted and in 1970 a bridge from the mainland via Russell Island was under serious consideration by the Queensland government. The Queensland Government also proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the island in the mid 1980s which would have seen the population of the island increase tenfold. However, after a concerted bid by conservationists and planners concerned at the impact on wetlands, fish breeding grounds and the impact of population growth, the idea fell from favour in February 1986 when Premier Bjelke- Peterson ruled the idea was not \\"financially viable\\". In 1991, the Australian Government and sand mining companies ACI and CRL attempted to reach an agreement on surrender of some or parts of mining lease tenements to form a national park. Half of North Stradbroke Island was to become a national park in return for a guarantee that mining could continue for the life of several mines in high-grade areas.1 The agreement was not signed by either of the mining companies nor the Government and has lapsed. Sibelco Australia operated three sand mining sites on the island ‚Äì Enterprise (by far the largest), Vance and Yarraman. The Sibelco-owned Enterprise MIne overlaid onto a map of Brisbane suburbs, to illustrate the area of the sand mining. Mineral sands and silica sands at Vance mine, near Dunwich, are mined from the surface. Rutile, zircon and ilmenite were dredged from the Enterprise Mine, southeast of Dunwich (and previously the Yarraman Mine, south of Point Lookout). Enterprise was the largest mine on the island and accounted for 60% of the island's production in 2011. It operated in close proximity to the Eighteen mile Swamp along a migrating dredge path with a buffer zone from the wetlands prescribed by the Queensland Government. Conservationists have expressed concern that these buffer zones, the smallest of which is , are inadequate to protect the Ramsar-listed wetlands from pollution and will fail to protect the waterways, citing evidence from the 1976 inquiry into sandmining on Fraser Island which found even buffer between areas mined and wetlands was \\"totally inadequate\\".

The silica extracted was used mainly in glass production, but also in digital tablets such as iPads. The mineral sands were used in paints, plastics, metals, cosmetics and biotechnological devices (such as prosthesis), both for domestic and international markets. The international market for Australian mineral sands, sold through Iluka resources, was mainly China, where 80% of exports are used as pigment in paints. A 2010 KPMG assessment, commissioned by Sibelco Australia, found 95% of revenue from NSI sand mining stayed in the Australian community.  Environmental concerns push for closure In 1991, up to 100,000 litres of diesel spilled from the sand mining company, Consolidated Rutile Limited [CRL] into Amity wetlands. This was not reported until 1994, the same year CRL was awarded a commendation in the inaugural State Government Award for Environmental Excellence. It was not until 1997 that the incident was acknowledged in CRL's Annual Report stating that the spill was expected to be cleared by 1999 ‚Äì eight years after it occurred. The sand mining company was never fined by the Department of Mines and Energy for these environmental incidents and continues operating. In 2008, CRL received the Premier's Environment Protection Agency Sustainability Award for Resources industries for its rehabilitation processes.(15 April 2011).

Access online on 22 February 2012 At that time (according to the Stradbroke Island Management Organisation [SIMO], an environmental watch-dog organisation) two-thirds of the island were covered by mining leases. In late 2009, CRL, which became a subsidiary of Unimin Australia, itself a subsidiary of Sibelco, after being purchased from Iluka Resources, was charged with illegal sand mining after it was alleged to have sold sand extracted from the island, to the building industry for the production of glass without the correct permit. Sibelco appealed, on technical grounds, the Magistrate's decision that it had a case to answer on the criminal charges for the illegal selling of sand. On 22 May 2014, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal and delivered its judgement, all on the same day. It dismissed Sibelco's appeal against criminal proceedings.http://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2014/QCA14-113.pdf The final day of this now five-year-long criminal trial was scheduled for 22 August 2014, in the Warwick Magistrates Court. In 2009 it became public knowledge that the mining leases on North Stradbroke island had also expired for the areas of operation of the Enterprise and Yarraman Mines. This led to the June 2010 announcement by the then Premier Anna Bligh that sand mining on the island would be phased out by 2027 and the mined land and RAMSAR listed wetlands would become national park, eventually to cover 80% of the island. This proposal relied on renewing expired mining leases under the Mineral Resources Act. In another legal matter, the High Court of Australia ruled against Sibelco in June 2011 over a bid to sell sand to construction companies. Sibelco had lodged the appeal against the Redland City Council's 2008 decision to deny the sand mining company's application to sell of sand to construction companies over the next 100 years. The ensuing public discussion around future land use saw concern expressed by some residents as to the impact on the island's economy. and by conservationists who saw it as sand mining business as usual, as the non-renewal of expired leases would effectively end mining around 2014.Save Straddie. Save Straddie. Retrieved 24 August 2013. Conservationists campaigned with the simple message that 2027 was, in fact, the forecast date for the exhaustion of the mineral deposits on NSI as already anticipated by the Enterprise and Yarraman mine operators, citing details from CRL's letter of 13 May 2009 to the Australian Securities Exchange [ASIX] that mineral sand mining as an economic force on the island would end by 2027. Sibelco Australia's commercial interests benefited by continued access to the mineral sand deposits on the expired leases until 2027, and, in 2010, Sibelco Australia commissioned Synergies Economic Consulting to report on the economic effect of an earlier closure of sand mining on NSI. The consultant's report predicted an earlier closure of sand mining would prompt a rise in the price of ferry transport services, electricity services and fuel for the 2000 residents, with total employment on the island anticipated to drop by 30%. Mining lease ML1117, the largest expired lease, contained the extensive Enterprise dredge mine, with a surface area of and a depth of . The application process for the renewal of mining leases requires the Minister for Mines for the Queensland government to consider future land uses of the area covered by the expired mining lease, under special section 286A of the Mineral Resources Act. The Minister can not renew an expired lease if further mining would be inappropriate having regard to future uses of the land. Since it was last renewed in 1986, parts of ML1117 had been included in the national estate because of its high conservation value, parts had been included in the Moreton Bay Ramsar protected wetland and all of it was for inclusion in a future national park. Conservationists foresaw there existed a strong argument that further mining would have been totally inappopriate, given regard for future and continuing land uses and therefore the lease ML1117 could not be renewed under the Mineral Resources Act. Under Queensland law, a ministerial decision to renew ML1117 would have allowed a right to judicial review of the decision in the Queensland Supreme Court by indigenous owners, the Quandamooka people of NSI, and conservationists. These parties had publicly flagged they would certainly use that right, given the good prospects of overturning the lease renewal decision upon judicial review, and bringing about the cessation of sand mining on the island around 2014. In response to the public debate, and to the very real likelihood that expired mining leases would not be successfully renewed under the Minerals Resources Act if proper regard was given to future land use, on 22 March 2011 then Premier Anna Bligh announced that the Enterprise Mine would continue the operating until 2019, the Yarraman mine would operate until 2015 and the silica mine (Vance) until 2025. The Queensland government would approve sand mining on North Stradbroke Island not through considering an application for renewal of a mining lease under the Mineral Resources Act, but through the passage of a new Act, the Stradbroke Island Sustainability and Protection Act 2011 (NSI Act). This Act was passed in April 2011. The Act renewed the key expired Enterprise Mine mining lease ML1117 until 31 December 2019 and also extinguished the pre-existing judicial rights of conservationists and Indigenous owners opposed to renewal of the leases. The Act also renewed two expired leases to facilitate continued silica sand mining at Vance until 2025.

The State Government planned to develop tourism opportunities by creating new walking tracks, camping grounds and recreational facilities. However, economic modeling undertaken by consultants commissioned by Sibelco Australia, Synergies Economic Consulting, states the growth in labour demand from tourism expansion is not expected to be rapid. This was because, at the time of the report in 2011, there was an overall weakness in domestic tourism across Australia.Tourism Forecasting Committee. (2011). Forecast 2011 Issue 1: Regional Forecasts Table. Accessed online on 22 February 2012 Under the 2011 legislation, the Enterprise mine was to close by 2019, and the much smaller Vance mine by 2025. In January 2012, then state opposition LNP leader Campbell Newman announced that if elected his party would restore rights around mining leases to what they were [prior to the NSI Act passed in April 2011] and Sibelco Australia supported his electoral campaign by posting letters to voters by \\"mine supporters\\" without required disclosure, urging a vote for Campbell Newman. Sibelco belatedly obtained authorisation and in 2013 filed a disclosure revealing it had spent more than on postage and printing. However, this election promise was not fulfilled, with no restoration of rights to citizens extinguished by the North Stradbroke Island Sustainability Act. Instead, in 2013 the LNP Government passed legislation that allows sand mining on the island for an extra 16 years from 2019 to 2035. The circumstances leading up to this legislative amendment were referred to Queensland's Crime and Misconduct Commission. The public debate concerning sand-mining re-opened in late 2012 when conservationists and Indigenous traditional owners, the Quandamooka people of NSI, discovered that the Enterprise mine had commenced operation in 2004 without Federal government approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). As the Enterprise mine operates in close proximity to the RAMSAR protected wetlands, experts had advised that the mine was having significant impact on the adjoining wetland, as water used in the sand mine's operation flows into these protected areas. The wetlands are part of complex hydrological systems forming art of the ancient dunes, some up to 300,000 years old, and the long-term impacts on the wetlands are unknown. In August 2013, Friends of Stradbroke Island Inc was preparing to take Sibelco Australia to the Federal Court, as the Federal Government had not taken any steps to enforce Sibelco's compliance with Australian environment protection laws. On 6 June 2014 the Quandamooka people initiated a legal challenge, saying that the LNP Government's extension of mining contravened the Native Title Act 1993 (Cwth). When Labor won office in 2015, the Palaszczuk government returned the end date to 2019. Closure of the sand mines The Yarraman mine closed in 2015. The Enterprise site was wound up in 2019, as per the 2011 legislation, while the much smaller Vance mine will continue to operate until 2025. A statement of intent was signed on 20 February 2019 by Sibelco Australia, the Queensland government and the Quandamooka people, by which the three sand mines would be rehabilitated. It would cost tens of millions of dollars and take five to six years. The Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation would move from its role in land care and cultural heritage advice into being responsible for the later stages of rehabilitation and developing the island as a cultural and wildlife sanctuary.  Community fund  In 2011, Sibelco announced the formation of a new community fund, funded from the profits of sand mining ‚Äì the Belgian family-owned mining company has made profits of approximately $1.5Billion dollars from its sand mining lease on Stradbroke Island. According to the fund, it \\"is the largest community investment ever made in the history of the Bay Islands\\".Welcome to the Straddie Community Fund. Sibelco. Retrieved 16 February 2012.

Arts, culture and tourism Arts such as fibre art and basketry and weaving techniques are being taught in workshops by a New Zealand-born artist living on the island, and Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Cameron Costello is working to expand the tourism industry based on arts and culture, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous.

It consists of the two old towns of Skan√∂r and Falsterbo which have grown together and were unified in 1754, but are still regarded as different communities by locals. The preposition med means with. Thanks to its southerly and maritime position, the locality is the mildest in Sweden, with winter lows barely averaging frosts. Background It is a conurbation consisting of the two medieval towns of Skan√∂r and Falsterbo. Both towns are located on the elongated reef-like western part of the Falsterbo Peninsula, (Falsterbon√§set), Falsterbo to the south and Skan√∂r to the north. The towns are separated by a several kilometers long bank built of earth and seaweed, and have never geographically been considered the same town. The peninsula forms the southwesternmost tip of the Scandinavian Peninsula. It marks the border between the Baltic Sea and the √òresund, the sound that separates the Danish island Zealand from the southern Swedish province of Scania. Geography The locality is situated south of the city of Malm√∂, 28 km from Skan√∂r and 30 km from Falsterbo, based on the local distance signs along the motorway. During the 20th century the towns have become affluent suburbs for people working in the Malm√∂-Lund region, as well as a popular site among older people who have retired from higher positions abroad or in the capital. The peninsula is divided by the Falsterbo Canal, a waterway at the base of the Falsterbo Peninsula that shortens the route between the √òresund and the Baltic Sea. The canal goes between the bays H√∂llviken (north) and K√§mpingebukten (south). Climate The Swedish meteorological institute SMHI operates a weather station in Falsterbo. Like the rest of Scania, it has an oceanic climate (Cfb), but with greater maritime effects than in Malm√∂ for example, due to its unsheltered position on the peninsula. It is also the southernmost official station in Sweden. This combination renders it have a January mean for 1961-1990 above freezing, a very unusual occurrence in Sweden. Falsterbo is often cooler than Malm√∂ during the day and milder during the night due to the low diurnal temperature variation. The great maritime effects as well as the ice-free winters of the region contributes to both yearly heat and cold records being subdued by Swedish standards, however specific climate events have shrunk the temperature to and raised it to . In 2006, Falsterbo had an absolute December minimum of , exceptionally mild by Swedish standards. The precipitation normal value from 1961-1990 is , making it a very dry climate considering it being oceanic. Due to the very marine nature, Falsterbo is the mildest weather station in Sweden, in spite of summer highs being far below surrounding areas. It also makes it sunnier than inland Lund, with 1902 hours of bright sunshine annually compared to the 1801 hours of Lund in the 2002-2016 period, this due to less convection build-up during spring and summer. History Origin The origin of Skan√∂r can be traced back to the end of the 12th century and Falsterbo is believed to have arisen shortly before. In around 1220 the Danish king built the Skan√∂r fortress. S:ta Gertrud church in Falsterbo dates back to the 13th century, possibly the 12th. History of Skan√∂r-Falsterbo (hotellgasslingen.com) Growth During the late middle ages both towns grew in importance and wealth as during late summer and autumn the peninsula was an important centre of trade and herring fishing in the annual Scania Market (Sk√•nemarknaden). The market was held on the beach stretch between Skan√∂r and Falsterbo and was dominated by the north German Hanseatic cities, primarily L√ºbeck. The Danish king delegated specific areas along the beach to these cities, so called \\"fit\\" or \\"fed\\", where they had the right to carry out trade during the Scania Market. A large fishing village was located along the beaches of √òresund. Soon thereafter a castle was raised in Falsterbo. In 1311 the castle was destroyed by the Hanseatic League (specifically the trade towns of Rostock, Wismar and Greifswald) in the war between these and the Danish king Erik Menved. After the war the king raised a new and larger castle in 1318 called Falsterbohus. The old castle in Skan√∂r thus lost its importance thereafter. Olav IV of Norway, son of queen Margaret I of Denmark, died in 1387 in Falsterbohus. After the herring population declined during the 16th century the Scania Market was dismantled and subsequently the two cities lost their former importance, but retained the town privileges, with joint administration. Recent history The two medieval towns Skan√∂r and Falsterbo were united economically under the same mayor in 1754. Even so, they have geographically never been considered the same town, and they did not grow into a contiguous settlement until the late 1960s. Falsterbo and Skan√∂r remained small fishing towns until the rail line from Malm√∂ to Falsterbo via Vellinge was built in 1904. Between 1904 and 1971 Skan√∂r and Falsterbo each had their own railway stations. New residential areas grew up along the railway. Due to its small size Skan√∂r med Falsterbo was the last city in Sweden to get a City Council (1934), but it had its own jurisdiction and a City Court (r√•dhusr√§tt) up until 1947. It is now a locality within Vellinge Municipality and has no administration of its own. The railway closed in 1971 and was dismantled the following year. Skan√∂r Cement factory During the first world war a track was laid to the new cement factory located in the Skan√∂r harbour. There are rumours that the cement factory was used as a depot for military equipment in case the war reached Sweden. Others claim that the factory was built under German influence only to serve as a disguise for a giant artillery foundation and that the bricks in the walls were placed upright to save costs. The canon together with its counterpart in K√∏ge in Denmark had as a purpose to guard the √òresund. In any case the cement factory was dismantled a few years thereafter. Of the cement factory only the foundation still exists today. Notability Falsterbo is known for the Falsterbo Bird Observatory, since most migratory birds leave the Scandinavian Peninsula via the 5 km long reef south of Falsterbo. The very same reef, and the fine sand beaches on the peninsula, offers some of the best sea bathing of Sweden. Falsterbo also has an annual horse show (show jumping and dressage), the Falsterbo Horse Show. Skan√∂r used to host the annual, Skan√∂rs sillamarknad.

She remained below during daylight hours and came up after dark to get a better view as she recharged her batteries and filled up with fresh air. On the night of 30 September, Trepang spotted a fast convoy departing Tokyo Bay. The submarine gave chase and closed in on a group of ships which included two large tankers, a small freighter, and an escort. The submarine fired an overlapping spread of torpedoes which struck the freighter, 750-ton Takunan Maru, and sent her to the bottom. On 10 October, Trepang attacked her second convoy, which consisted of a pair of tankers and a single escort. Although the submarine claimed a \\"kill\\", a postwar assessment of the action did not credit her with a sinking. The following day, the error was reversed. The submarine launched four torpedoes at another Japanese ship, and her commanding officer recorded that all of the \\"fish\\" had missed. This time, however, postwar accounting credited Trepang with the destruction of the 1,000-ton Transport Number 105. On 12 October, the submarine cruised some southwest of the entrance to Tokyo Bay. Soon after she came to the surface, and her radar swept the surrounding seas, four pips showed themselves on the phosphorescent screen‚Äîtwo large and two small‚Äîwhich were identified as two battleships and two destroyers. Despite the fact that the phosphorescent waters would make his submarine stand out starkly in the night, Davenport closed at flank speed and fired a full spread of six torpedoes. The \\"fish\\" sped through the water toward their targets. He claimed success when explosions rumbled across the water, and flames lit up the night. Davenport turned the submarine to present her stern tubes to the enemy and loosed four more torpedoes. These all missed. Davenport's gallant and skillfully pressed attacks earned him his fourth Navy Cross. He felt that he had damaged a and had sunk a destroyer, but a study of Japanese records after the war did not verify either claim. [In fact the Trepang had damaged the Japanese destroyer Fuyutsuki off Omaesuki]Official Naval Chronology 12 October 1944 Her supply of torpedoes exhausted, Trepang cleared the area and headed for the Marshall Islands. She reached Majuro on 23 October for voyage repairs alongside submarine tender and brief training.  Second patrol: November ‚Äì December 1944  On 16 November, Trepang got underway for the Philippine Islands leading a \\"wolfpack\\" which also included sister ships and . The wolfpack's nickname was \\"ROY'S RANGERS\\" as Trepangs own commanding officer, Roy M Davenport, was the officer in charge of the pack. The weather was dark, windy, and rough on 6 December as Trepangs conning tower broke the surface after a day's submerged inshore patrol off Luzon. While shifting course toward deeper water, she detected a group of ships approaching from the northward. Upon closing to investigate, Trepang counted seven large ships and three escorts in the convoy which slowly approached the Philippines. Trepang radioed news of her \\"find\\" to her packmaster and then submerged. The submarine shot straight and true, sending freighter Banshu Maru Number 31 and cargo ship Jinyo Maru to the bottom in quick succession and damaging a third vessel, Fukuyo Maru. However, as Trepang came about to administer the coup de grace to Fukuyo Maru, the third cargo ship obligingly blew up and sank. Meanwhile, as Segundo and Razorback arrived on the scene, Trepang fired all of her remaining torpedoes at a fourth ship which, she reported, blew up and sank soon thereafter. However, this fourth sinking was not confirmed by Japanese records. In the meantime, the other two American submarines were trying to finish off the fleeing remnants of the shattered convoy and managed to sink two ships, one with the aid of American naval aircraft. Trepang, now out of torpedoes, sped back to Pearl Harbor, arriving before Christmas. Following this war patrol, Davenport, one of the most highly decorated submariners of the war, left Trepang for shore duty as an instructor at the United States Naval Academy.  Third patrol: January ‚Äì March 1945  Again sailing for Honsh≈´, Trepang‚Äînow under Cmdr. Allen R. Faust‚Äîteamed up with submarines , , , and , known as \\"MAC's MOPS,\\" on an anti-picket boat sweep past Nanp≈ç Islands, the eastern island chain south of Tokyo, to clear the sea lanes for the aircraft carriers of Task Force 58 which in turn was about to strike the Japanese home islands to neutralize them during the assault on the strategic island of Iwo Jima. Trepang encountered no worthwhile targets during the patrol and had to settle for performing lifeguard duty for aircraft carrier assaults on Tokyo. On 24 February 1945, the submarine sank the 875-ton freighter Usuki Maru and blew the bow off another small coastal vessel. While maneuvering to finish off the crippled ship, several antisubmarine vessels appeared on the scene from behind a nearby headland and converged on the fleet boat. Trepang dove deep as the Japanese subjected her to a seven-hour depth charge barrage. On 14 March, Trepang sank the IJN Guardboat Kaiko Maru off Inubosaki.Official Navy Chronology 14 March 1945On 17 March, Trepang attacked and sank 117-ton picket boat Tsukiura Maru (converted bonito & tunny fishing boat) off Torishima.The Maru Special, Japanese Naval Vessels No. 53, \\"Japanese support vessels\\", (1981), p. 62  Fourth patrol: April ‚Äì May 1945  Following her return to Guam in March, Trepang headed for the Yellow Sea, a \\"hazardous duty\\" area due to its vast stretches of shallow water. Despite the danger, the submarine performed well, sinking the 1000-ton landing craft Transport Number 146 on 28 April; the 4667-ton, heavily laden freighter, Miho Maru two days later; and Minesweeper Number 20 which blew sky-high with a hit on her magazine on 4 May. In addition, the submarine surfaced to shell a junk with a load of lumber. The sole member of this victim's crew, a Korean, understood little sign language, and looked to be of little value for intelligence purposes, so he was put back on board his barely seaworthy craft, with tools and food, and sent on his way.The official summary reports that the submarine just destroyed his lumber cargo but not his barely seaworthy vessel Leaving the Yellow Sea, Trepang did a short tour of lifeguarding for B-25 Mitchell strikes on Shanghai, China, and for the continuing series of B-29 Superfortress raids on Tokyo, before she returned to Guam.  Fifth patrol: June ‚Äì July 1945  Trepangs fifth war patrol was divided into two parts‚Äîthe first saw the ship operating in a lifeguard capacity while the second gave her a more offensive role off northeastern Honsh≈´ and eastern Hokkaid≈ç. In the former role, she arrived on station to the southeast of Tokyo Bay. Having experienced two previous tours of lifeguarding, Trepangs men expected a series of long dull days, spent moving in circles, squares, or triangles to break the monotony. However, shortly before noon on her first day, lookouts spotted a blossoming parachute overhead and soon saw the splash of a crashed P-51 Mustang fighter damaged while escorting Superfortresses to Tokyo. Trepang bent on full power and soon picked up the downed aviator, Second Lieutenant Lamar Christian, USAAF, safe and sound. During the maneuver, another Mustang, piloted by First Lieutenant Frank Ayres, USAAF, radioed that it, too, was in trouble; and the pilot requested permission to bail out. Trepang replied telling Ayres to \\"be patient\\" until the first rescue was complete. Ayres circled the submarine until Christian was safely on board the submarine. Ayres then executed a perfect jump and landed some away from Trepang and was soon hauled on board. Three days after rescuing the two airmen, Trepang turned them over to submarine which was on her way home with 30 other aviators already on board. In the middle of the transfer, the submarines picked up a radio message from a \\"Boxkite\\" (rescue search plane) that a Superfortress crew, downed the previous day, was floating a mere seven miles (10 km) from the Japanese seaport of Nagoya. Accompanied by sister ship which had also been discharging passengers to Tigrone, Trepang surged ahead. The two submarines raced to save the Superfortress's crew. Trepang put on full speed and arrived on the scene first. She found eight survivors in four groups of rafts, spread over about four miles (6 km) of ocean. By the time Springer arrived on the scene, Trepang had picked up seven of the fliers. Springer picked up the last man. [Four other members of the crew did not survive having been either trapped in the plane; having a burning parachute or missing].Summary of Ships History[The Bomber was B-29 44-70109 of the 504th Bomb Group lost 26 June 1945]Find a grave virtual memorial On June 30, 1945Combined Fleet Summary USS TrepangEn route to a rendezvous with submarine , Trepang sighted a small, troop-laden freighter and sank the ship with her deck guns. A dozen or so Japanese soldiers from the flaming vessel refused to be picked up and taken prisoner and so were left to drown.Official summary of ships history p.3 describes enemy vessel as either a 492 ton minesweeper or later described p.9 as a 600 ton freighter; in either case vessel was armed with two 37mm machine guns Subsequently patrolling off the eastern coast of Honsh≈´, Trepang went scoreless until July 7, 1945 when she spotted a coastal convoy of three ships. She torpedoed and sank the lead ship‚ÄîKoun Maru Number Two‚Äîbut the other vessels conducted evasive action and sped away from the scene at full speed. Satisfied that she had done her best, Trepang, heading to seaward, suddenly shuddered under the impact of two depth bomb explosions. A solitary Japanese plane had spotted Trepangs shadow in the shallow waters and had attacked with depth bombs. Fortunately, all missed their mark. Given another lifeguarding assignment, Trepang stood on the alert to pick up possible downed airmen from British and American carrier strikes on the Japanese home islands. During this tour in July 1945, she rescued one pilot, Lieutenant, junior grade, Bill Kingston, USNR. In addition, on 14 July, she witnessed a shore bombardment conducted by three battleships and a heavy cruiser against Kamaishi during which, reportedly, Trepang sunk a 100 ton Lugger with her deck gunCombined Fleet By now, the war was moving fast, and Trepang returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit. There, she watched the tumbling succession of staggering headlines‚Äîfirst the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union's entry into the Far Eastern War, Japan's tentative acceptance of surrender terms, and finally, on 15 August, peace at last.  Post-war activities  After completion of her refit, Trepang departed Pearl Harbor and arrived at San Diego on 3 September 1945. Decommissioned on 27 June 1946 and placed in reserve at Vallejo, California, at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Trepang remained in reserve into the 1960s. She was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine and given hull classification symbol AGSS-412 on 11 June 1962. Featured in the November 25, 1962 episode (Season 4, Episode 9) entitled \\"Dennis At Boot Camp\\" of the sitcom \\"Dennis the Menace.\\" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0557922/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June 1967, the submarine was authorized for disposal on 22 December 1967. She was subsequently sunk as a target during Exercise \\"Strike Ex 4-69\\" on 16 September 1969 by the combined gunfire of destroyers and .

The show originally ran on CBS from September 4, 1972, to December 10, 1976, and was recorded at CBS Television City in Studios 31, 33, 41, and 43. On October 27, 1980, NBC revived the show as Las Vegas Gambit, as a replacement for The David Letterman Show, and kept it on its schedule until November 27, 1981. As the title implied, this edition of Gambit was recorded in Las Vegas at the Tropicana Las Vegas. Both versions were hosted by Wink Martindale and announced by Kenny Williams. Elaine Stewart was the card dealer for the CBS version, while Beverly Malden filled this role for the first half of Las Vegas Gambit, and was later replaced by Lee Menning. Another Merrill Heatter-produced, blackjack-based quiz show, Catch 21, began airing on GSN in 2008. Gameplay Main game The object of the main game was that of blackjack: come as close to 21 as possible without going over (or busting). As in blackjack, the cards 2 through 10 were worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) counted as 10, and Aces could count as either 1 or 11. Martindale asked a series of questions, usually multiple- choice or true-false, to two married couples. The first couple who buzzed in and correctly answered the question won control of the top card from a deck of oversized playing cards. An incorrect answer awarded control of the card to the couple's opponents. Once a couple gained control of a card, they had the option of adding it to their own hand or passing it to their opponents. The first card of the game was revealed before the question was asked. Each subsequent card was presented face-down and was turned up once the couple in control decided who should receive it. After a couple received any card (either by choice or by having it passed to them) and could potentially go over 21 with another card, they could elect to freeze, preventing them from receiving any more cards. Freezing was not permitted when the two couples were tied. If one couple froze, the other continued answering questions and received a card after each one. A couple could win the game in one of four ways: * If they reached a total of 21. Doing so also won the Gambit Jackpot, a cash bonus that reset to $500 after it was claimed. On the original series, the Gambit Jackpot increased by $500 at the start of each program if it had not been won on the previous show. On Las Vegas Gambit, the Gambit Jackpot increased for each match it went unclaimed. * If their opponents busted. * If they froze and their opponents missed a subsequent question. * If they exceeded their frozen opponents' total without busting. Each game was worth $100. The first team to win two out of three games won the match and advanced to the bonus round. Bonus round Gambit Board For the entire original series and the first half of Las Vegas Gambit, the winning couple played the Gambit Bonus Board. They faced a large game board with 21 numbered cards (18 numbered video screens on Las Vegas Gambit), each concealing a prize. After selecting a number, the couple received the prize behind it and a card was added to their hand from the top of the deck. The couple could end the bonus game by doing any of the following: * Choosing to stop before reaching 21, which allowed them to keep all the prizes they had uncovered. Couples could do this if they feared the next card might cause them to bust, or if they had won a desirable prize that they did not want to risk losing. In early episodes of Las Vegas Gambit, a couple could elect to stop only when their hand totaled 17 or more. * Busting, at which point they lost everything they found on the board. * Reaching 21 exactly, which awarded a new car (original series) or $5,000 cash (Las Vegas Gambit), the Gambit Jackpot, and all prizes uncovered during the bonus game. Throughout the CBS version, returning champions continued until winning a grand total of $25,000, relinquishing any winnings over that amount. From 1972 to 1975, the show featured an annual promotion in which the first couple to get a two-card 21 (an Ace and a face card/10) in the bonus round won either $200 a week for a year (totaling $10,400) or a flat $10,000, depending on the year. Special awards were occasionally hidden among the numbers, including: * Half-Checks: Showed cash amounts from $500 to $10,000 that had been split down the middle. Each right half showed two zeroes, while each left half showed the first digit(s) of the amount (for example, \\"$2,5\\" left and \\"00\\" right awarded $2,500). Any left and right halves could be matched together, crediting the couple with that amount of money. If a couple ended a bonus game without busting and had an unmatched half-check, they held onto it and would try to find the matching half if they won their next match. * Suit Cards: Displayed one of the four playing card suits. The couple won $500 immediately, plus an additional $500 for each card in the indicated suit that they had in their hand when the round ended. * Hot Card: A card whose rank was kept hidden until the round was over. The couple won $1,000 if they had a card of this rank in their hand, or $100 otherwise. * Swap: Allowed the couple to trade in one of their prizes for another pick from the board after the round ended, if they chose to do so. This award did not add a card to the couple's hand. * Take Two: Allowed the couple to choose two more numbers before being dealt the next card. * 100/200/500 Times: After the round ended, one card was dealt from the deck and its value was multiplied by the indicated number in dollars. Aces always counted as 11 in this respect, for a maximum of $1,100, $2,200, or $5,500. * Top or Bottom: A blind choice between two prizes of a similar type, one of which was considerably more expensive than the other. \\"Cruise,\\" for example, could award a cruise to either the Caribbean or Catalina Island. * Stop or Go: After the round ended, cards were dealt out one at a time, each worth $100 times its value (with aces counted as 11). The couple could stop at any time, but if a card came up that matched the suit of the first one dealt, the game ended and they lost the accumulated money. * Beat the House (original series) / Beat the Dealer (Las Vegas Gambit): After the round ended, the couple played a hand of traditional blackjack against Martindale, who acted as the house and had to follow standard rules (hit on 16 or lower, stand on 17 or higher). If the couple won, they received an additional $2,500 (original series) or $1,000 (Las Vegas Gambit). Gambit Galaxy For the second half of the NBC version, the Gambit Board was replaced by a renamed Big Numbers bonus round from the Heatter-Quigley show High Rollers. In this round, called the Gambit Galaxy, the couple was presented with a pair of dice and was required to remove the numbers 1 through 9 from a board in front of them. On each turn, the couple rolled the dice and chose numbers to remove that added up to the total shown. (For example, if they rolled an 8, they could remove the 8 alone; 1 and 7; 2 and 6; 3 and 5; 1, 2, and 5; or 1, 3, and 4.) They won $100 for each number removed, and if they managed to knock all nine numbers off the board they won $5,000 in cash and a prize package, which usually included at least $5,000 in prizes to start and kept accumulating until a couple won it. The round ended if the couple made a \\"bad roll\\" - a total that could not be achieved using the remaining numbers - or if they removed every number except 1. Rolling doubles awarded an insurance marker; if a bad roll came up, the couple could turn in the marker and continue playing. Broadcast history CBS, 1972‚Äì76 Logo used from 1972 to 1976. CBS originally aired Gambit at 11 a.m/10 Central, where it defeated NBC's Sale of the Century. It also easily beat Alex Trebek's American debut program, The Wizard of Odds, which NBC began in July 1973. On April 1, 1974 (the same day Now You See It with Jack Narz premiered), CBS moved the show back a half-hour to 10:30/9:30, where it faced NBC's aging quiz Jeopardy! with Art Fleming, just over a full decade before Trebek would host a revival of that show himself. NBC moved Jeopardy! to the afternoons on July 1 and placed one of the many Bill Cullen- Bob Stewart collaborations, Winning Streak in the slot. That show's weakness made late 1974 the high point of Gambits original daytime run at least in the Nielsen ratings. On January 6, 1975, NBC replaced Winning Streak with Wheel of Fortune, which took a chunk out of Gambits audience. On the same day, NBC expanded the soap opera Another World to sixty minutes and the impact it had on the ratings of The Price is Right which aired at 3:00 pm and then forced CBS to shuffle its schedule again on August 18, 1975, and move Price back to the morning schedule, which it had left in 1973. Gambit moved back to 11:00 am, bumping Tattletales back to the afternoon after two months and remained there until late 1977, when it returned to the morning until its March 1978 cancellation. At that slot, Gambit initially had to go against its sister Heatter-Quigley show High Rollers, also hosted by Alex Trebek. However, NBC decided to air a sixty-minute edition of Wheel beginning on December 1 with the second half competing with Gambit. Furthermore, NBC left Wheel at 11:00 am when the experiment ended seven weeks later in January 1976 and it continued to eat away at Gambit in the ratings. The network canceled the four-year-old game two weeks before Christmas 1976 and replaced it with Goodson-Todman's Double Dare with Trebek taking the hosting position after High Rollers came to an end on June 11, 1976. After its cancellation, repeats of Gambit were later seen on KHJ-TV Channel 9 (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles, starting in fall 1977 and running until spring 1978. NBC, 1980‚Äì81 (Las Vegas Gambit) Gambit returned on October 27, 1980, as one of two replacements for the short-lived The David Letterman Show (the other was Goodson-Todman's Blockbusters). Stan Worth composed the theme for this version. with Beverly Malden serving as card dealer before she was replaced by Lee Menning. Producer Robert Noah, director Jerome Shaw, and announcer Kenny Williams carried over from the original. Despite limited competition in reruns of situation comedies on CBS, and local or syndicated programming on ABC affiliates, the revival failed to draw the ratings of its predecessor and was cancelled after just over a year. Personnel Both the original version and Las Vegas Gambit were hosted by Wink Martindale, with Kenny Williams, announcer of many other Heatter-Quigley shows, as announcer. Jerome Shaw was the director of both versions, and Robert Noah the producer. Elaine Stewart was the card dealer on the original version, while Beverly Malden served in this role on early episodes of Las Vegas Gambit before being replaced by Lee Menning. Mort Garson composed the original version's theme, and Stan Worth composed the theme to Las Vegas Gambit. Catch 21 Gambit creator Merrill Heatter developed a similar show, Catch 21, which premiered on GSN July 21, 2008 with Alfonso Ribeiro as host and Mikki Padilla as dealer. Episode status Five episodes of the CBS version from 1973 are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The pilot for an unsold 1990 revival, hosted by Bob Eubanks, is also present within the same collection.

Entering production in 1963 as the Mk 57, the bomb was designed to be dropped from high-speed tactical aircraft. It had a streamlined casing to withstand supersonic flight. It was 3 m (9 ft 10 in) long, with a diameter of about 37.5 cm (14.75 in). Basic weight was approximately 227 kilograms (500 lbs). Some versions of the B57 were equipped with a parachute retarder (a 3.8 m/12.5 ft diameter nylon/kevlar ribbon parachute) to slow the weapon's descent, allowing the aircraft to escape the blast (or to allow the weapon to survive impact with the ground in laydown mode) at altitudes as low as 15 m (50 ft). Various fuzing modes were available, including a hydrostatic fuze for use as a depth charge for anti- submarine use. The B57 was produced in six versions (mods) with explosive yields ranging from 5 to 20 kilotons. Mod 0 was 5 kt, Mod 1 and Mod 2 were 10 kt, Mod 3 and Mod 4 were 15 kt, and Mod 5 was 20 kt. The depth bomb version of the B57, for the U.S. Navy, replaced the Mk 101 Lulu and had selectable yield up to 10 kt. The B57 used the Tsetse primary design for its core design, shared with several other mid- and late-1950s designs. The B57 was produced from 1963 to 1967. After 1968, the weapon became known as the B57 rather than the Mk 57. 3,100 weapons were built, the last of which was retired in June 1993. The B57 could be deployed by most U.S. fighter, bomber and Navy antisubmarine warfare and patrol aircraft (S-3 Viking and P-3 Orion), and by some U.S. Navy helicopters including the SH-3 Sea King. The B57 was also deployed with Canada's CF-104s in Germany, and the Royal Air Force's Nimrod from RAF St Mawgan and RAF Kinloss in the United Kingdom and Malta in the Mediterranean.

Career College Hesmer played college soccer at Wake Forest University from 2000 to 2003, establishing himself as one of the nation's best goalkeepers at that level. As a junior, Hesmer was named an NSCAA second team All-American, and as a senior was named a first team All-American. Professional After graduating from college, Hesmer was drafted 17th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Kansas City Wizards. However, with Tony Meola starting in goal, and the very experienced Bo Oshoniyi as his backup, Hesmer was not able to establish himself, and finished the MLS season without playing a single minute, although he did take to the field ‚Äì for one single minute in a game against Rochester Raging Rhinos ‚Äì during a brief loan spell with the Richmond Kickers in the A-League. In the 2006 season, Hesmer earned a handful of appearances, but did not make an impact on the first team. He was selected in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft by Toronto FC, but was only with the club for a matter of hours before being dealt to Columbus Crew for a partial allocation. The 2007 season saw Hesmer establish himself as the first team keeper for the Crew. He started 20 matches for the Columbus club. In the 2008 season Hesmer stopped penalty kicks in each of the Crew's first two matches, as well as a third against New England on May 8. He has been called into camp for the United States National Team but has yet to receive a cap. He surpassed Jon Busch as the franchise's all-time shutout leader by earning his 26th in a 1‚Äì0 triumph over Kansas City Wizards at CommunityAmerica Ballpark on May 23, 2010. Hesmer became the third goalkeeper in MLS history to score a goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Toronto FC at BMO Field on October 16, 2010. With the Crew trailing 2‚Äì1 in second-half stoppage time, he sprinted to the center of the Toronto FC penalty area as an extra attacker while an Eddie Gaven corner kick was in mid-flight. The ball was headed by Chad Marshall back to Hesmer, who was given enough time to trap, set and fire it into the net. A fractured right shoulder resulting from a collision with Danny Califf in the 85th minute of a 3‚Äì1 victory over Philadelphia Union in the regular season finale at Columbus Crew Stadium on October 24, 2010 forced Hesmer to miss the playoffs. He made his 100th league appearance for the Crew on March 26, 2011, keeping a clean sheet in a 0‚Äì0 tie with New York Red Bulls.Decimated Red Bulls hold Crew to scoreless tie An ankle sprain suffered during the first day of preseason training, sidelined Hesmer to begin the 2012 season. During the rehabilitation period, he made what would be his final appearance in the Black & Gold, starting and playing the first half for the Crew reserves in a 2‚Äì1 loss to the Montreal Impact reserves, following the Crew senior squad's home opener on March 24, 2012 at Columbus Crew Stadium. In April, Hesmer was forced to undergo surgery on his right hip, which had been initially injured three years earlier, costing him the remainder of the season. At the end of the year, Columbus declined his 2013 contract option and Hesmer chose to enter the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 14, 2012, he was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in stage two of the draft. Despite being selected, Hesmer didn't sign with the Galaxy and opted to retire on February 19, 2013. Will was signed to a 1-day contract with the Carolina Railhawks as a backup goalkeeper for their June 24, 2014 Open Cup match against the LA Galaxy. His post-career plans involve working in wealth management for Raymond James in Raleigh, North Carolina.

He played nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Chicago Cubs. Early life Ord√≥√±ez defected from Cuba to the United States at the 1993 Summer Universiade in Buffalo, New York. Ord√≥√±ez was a promising young player for the Havana Industriales club in Cuba at the time. In March 2013, Ord√≥√±ez finally traveled back to Cuba 20 years after defecting, and was given a hero's welcome. Professional career St. Paul Saints Before signing with a major league team, Ord√≥√±ez played part of the 1993 season with the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League. In 15 games with the Saints, he batted .283. He signed with the Mets as a free agent after the season, on October 29, 1993, and retired from baseball in 2007 after several years of injury-related absence from the majors. New York Mets Ord√≥√±ez joined the Single-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League in 1994 and later that season moved up to Double-A with the Eastern League's Binghamton Mets. He made his major league debut in 1996. Ord√≥√±ez won three consecutive Gold Glove Awards for his outstanding defensive play with the Mets from 1997 to 1999. During the 1999 and 2000 seasons, Ord√≥√±ez set a major league record for shortstops by playing 101 consecutive games without committing a fielding error. Furthermore, in 1999, Ord√≥√±ez committed only four errors while posting a .994 fielding percentage. It is arguably the best defensive single-season performance ever by a major league shortstop based on the number of errors. Though he rarely struck out and was capable of laying down sacrifice bunts, Ord√≥√±ez was not a particularly effective hitter. Besides a career batting average of .246, he was not a good base stealer, drew few walks and little power. His lifetime OPS of .600 was almost 200 points lower than the major league average (.782 in 2000, for example).2012 MLB Team Batting Stats ‚Äì Major League Baseball ‚Äì ESPN. Sports.espn.go.com. Retrieved on 2012-10-09. Ord√≥√±ez's defensive play never recovered after he fractured his left arm on May 29, 2000, when attempting to tag the Los Angeles Dodgers' F.P. Santangelo out at second base, an injury that prevented the three-time Gold Glove winner from playing in the 2000 World Series (the Subway Series) against the New York Yankees. Given that he offered little offensively, with his defense diminished, his value as a player became drastically reduced. Ord√≥√±ez was taunted by unhappy Mets fans throughout the 2002 season, particularly because the much-heralded double play combination of him and Roberto Alomar failed to produce. Devil Rays and Cubs On December 15, 2002, Ord√≥√±ez was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for two minor league players to be named later, along with $4.25 million to cover his salary. Ord√≥√±ez missed most of the 2003 season due to injuries and signed with the Chicago Cubs in 2004. He made his Cubs debut in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 28. He recorded his first hit in a Cubs uniform on June 2 against the Houston Astros. Ord√≥√±ez played 23 games and recorded 10 hits before being given his release by the Cubs on July 23, 2004. San Diego Padres In 2004, incoming rookie Khalil Greene beat out Ord√≥√±ez for the position of shortstop with the San Diego Padres during spring training.Grounding out to Greene By Michael Huang. He was unsure at the time whether he would ever play Major League Baseball again, and did not play for any major league organization during the and seasons. Seattle Mariners On November 14, 2006, Ord√≥√±ez was signed to a minor league contract by the Seattle Mariners. On April 1, 2007, Ord√≥√±ez was reassigned to the Mariners minor league camp, but stated to the Seattle Times newspaper that at the age of 35, he was \\"too old for that.\\" According to reports, Ord√≥√±ez was originally included on the Mariners final 25-man roster, but an 11th hour trade with the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Jason Ellison led to his reassignment.

He played, most notably at shortstop, in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Miami Marlins, Toronto Blue Jays, and Colorado Rockies. Reyes is a four-time MLB All-Star. He led MLB in triples in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. Reyes also led the National League (NL) in stolen bases in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He was the NL batting champion in 2011. He is also the New York Mets' all-time leader in triples and stolen bases. Minor league career Reyes was spotted by New York Mets scouts during a tryout camp in Santiago in the summer of 1999. After initial concerns over Reyes' slight frame, the Mets offered him a contract, which he signed on August 16, 1999. Despite traditionally sending youngsters to play in their Dominican academy, the Mets made an exception with Reyes and sent him to the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League for the 2000 season. He finished the season with a .250 batting average in 49 games. For the 2001 season, Reyes was assigned to the Capital City Bombers of the Class A South Atlantic League. He excelled both in the field and at the plate, hitting .307 with 42 extra-base hits and winning the Player of the Year award. After being invited to spring training with the major league Mets, Reyes began the 2002 season with the St. Lucie Mets in the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. In the first three months of the season, he demonstrated that he could handle the step up, and was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Double-A Eastern League. In his first game, Reyes had 5 hits and 4 RBIs, and he completed the season with a .287 average, 27 steals and 26 extra-base hits in 65 games. On December 15, 2002, the Mets traded starting shortstop Rey Ord√≥√±ez to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Two weeks later the Mets signed veteran Rey S√°nchez to a one- year deal, with the plan being to allow Reyes to mature in the minors while Sanchez kept the big-league spot warm for him. Reyes spent the first two months of the 2003 season with the Norfolk Tides of the Triple-A International League, where he batted .269 and stole 26 bases in just 42 games. Injuries to Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn had contributed to the Mets' poor performance in the National League East, and eventually convinced manager Art Howe to begin playing some of the team's younger talent. When Rey S√°nchez strained his thumb on June 5, 2003, Reyes received his call-up to the majors, just a day before his 20th birthday. Major League career New York Mets (2003‚Äì11) 2003‚Äì05 Reyes made his major league debut on June 10, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, the day before his 20th birthday, going 2-for-4 with a pair of runs scored in a 9‚Äì7 loss. Reyes was the first teenager to play for the Mets since Gregg Jefferies in 1987, and the first to start a game since Dwight Gooden in 1984. After the game, Reyes collected the ball from his first career hit and sent it to his parents. Over the following weeks Reyes' impressive form continued, including a grand slam off Jarrod Washburn in an 8‚Äì0 victory over the Angels. When Rey S√°nchez completed his month-long spell on the DL, Reyes' strong play moved S√°nchez to the bench. Reyes' season was cut short a month early by a sprained ankle, but he still managed to compile impressive rookie numbers. In 69 games, he batted .307 with 32 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. Reyes finished 8th in voting for the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year. Prior to the 2004 season, the Mets signed Japanese star Kazuo Matsui, whose only condition upon signing was that he got a chance to play his regular position, shortstop. As a result, Reyes was asked to learn second base duties. Early on in the season, Reyes strained a hamstring and remained on the DL until June 19. When he returned, the Mets were involved in a close race in the National League East with the Marlins, Phillies, and Braves. However, a back problem for Reyes and injuries to other key Mets players led to a collapse and instead of being involved in a pennant race, the team found itself fighting to stay out of last place in the division. By the end of the season, Reyes had returned to his preferred position of shortstop, with Matsui moving to second base. Reyes ended a disappointing season with a batting average of .255, 14 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases in 53 games. At the age of 21, Reyes was handed the leadoff spot in the Mets' line-up in his first full season in the major leagues. Despite struggling slightly with his plate discipline ‚Äî he had only 27 walks in a league-high 733 plate appearances ‚Äì he finished the season with solid numbers. In 161 games he had 48 extra-base hits, 58 RBIs and 60 stolen bases. Reyes led the National League in stolen bases and led the majors in triples. However, he also led all National League shortstops with 18 errors. 2006‚Äì07 Reyes is congratulated after scoring, 2006 During spring training in 2006, the Mets brought in former player Rickey Henderson as a specialist instructor. One of the reasons Henderson was hired was to help tutor Reyes in the arts of getting on base and stealing bases ‚Äì skills at which Henderson excelled throughout his own career. Reyes won Player of the Week honors in the National League for the weeks beginning June 12 and 19, becoming the first Mets player to be named the NL Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks since Jesse Orosco in 1983. During this two-week period Reyes had 30 hits in 57 at-bats (a .526 batting average) and raised his season batting average from .246 to .302. On June 21, 2006 in a 6‚Äì5 loss against the Cincinnati Reds Reyes hit for the cycle, becoming the ninth player in team history to do so. Reyes' outgoing personality began to make him a fan favorite in New York. He became well known for the elaborate handshakes he creates with his teammates to celebrate runs scored. In his spots as 'Professor Reyes', Reyes taught the Shea faithful the Spanish language between innings on the stadium's Diamond Vision screen, helping to make him one of the Mets' most popular players. On August 3, 2006, Reyes signed a four-year, $23.25 million contract extension with the Mets, thereby avoiding salary arbitration. The contract includes an $11 million option for 2011 with a buy-out of $500,000 if the Mets do not pick up the option. Reyes also received a $1.5 million signing bonus. On August 15, 2006, Reyes hit three home runs in an 11‚Äì4 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Two days later, he became the second player in Mets history to record at least 50 stolen bases in consecutive seasons. On September 7, 2006, Reyes hit the first inside-the-park home run of his career, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Reyes was timed at 14.81 seconds for his dash around the bases ‚Äî the equivalent of running a circular 100-meter dash in about 13.5 seconds. As the 2006 season wound down, Reyes was in pursuit of an unusual feat ‚Äî reaching 20 home runs, 20 triples, 20 doubles, and 20 stolen bases. Reyes finished the 2006 regular season with an average of .300, 19 home runs, 81 RBIs, 122 runs, and 64 stolen bases in 153 games. He increased his on-base percentage by 54 points, and his slugging percentage was almost 100 points higher than in 2005. Reyes' walk rate nearly doubled ‚Äî in 30 fewer plate appearances, he went from 27 walks to 53. He also showed similar improvement in the field ‚Äî in 2006 he had a range factor of 3.86, the lowest of all major league shortstops. Reyes picked up a Silver Slugger Award, was called up to his first All-Star Game, and finished 7th in NL MVP voting. The Mets clinched their spot in the playoffs, and Reyes experienced the postseason for the first time in his career. He made his playoff debut on October 4, 2006 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2006 National League Division Series. Though he hit just .167 for the series, he came up big in key situations, scoring the winning run in Game 1, driving in the go-ahead run in Game 2, and knocking in the game-tying run in the 6th inning of Game 3. In Game 6 of the 2006 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and facing elimination, Reyes hit a leadoff home run in the first inning to jump start his team and help force a deciding Game 7, which the Mets went on to lose, 3‚Äì1. In November 2006 Reyes participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series along with teammates John Maine and David Wright. He hit a 2-run walk-off home run in the 10th inning of Game 5, giving the MLB team their first sweep of their NPB rivals. On July 12, 2007, Reyes hit the ninth leadoff home run of his career against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Bronson Arroyo, setting a new record for the franchise. In August, Reyes stole his 50th base of the year, becoming the first New York baseball player to steal 50 or more bases in three consecutive seasons. On August 22, 2007, Reyes stole his 65th, 66th, and 67th bases and broke Roger Cede√±o's Mets record for the most stolen bases in a single season. August also saw Reyes tie the Mets record for stealing at least one base in four straight games. In the last month of the season, Reyes' struggles were seen to be a key component of the Mets' late-season collapse. He batted .205 and had an on-base percentage of only .279. His struggles brought much criticism from Mets fans. On the second-to-last day of the regular season he was involved in a benches-clearing brawl against the Florida Marlins, which started when Miguel Olivo charged across the diamond and threw a punch at Reyes. Olivo would be ejected from the game and Reyes was allowed to stay in. The Mets would win the game 13‚Äì0. Reyes finished the season with a .280 batting average, 60 extra-base hits, 12 home runs, 57 RBIs, and 78 stolen bases in 160 games. 2008‚Äì09 In spring training and the early part of the 2008 season, Reyes vocalized a plan to focus a little more on baseball, and a little less on the theatrics ‚Äî such as his dugout dances after home runs ‚Äî that drew criticism during the late part of 2007 when the Mets were struggling. One of the casualties of this change of focus was the Professor Reyes segment played between innings at Shea where he taught the fans Spanish words and phrases. This was replaced by 'Maine Street USA' with John Maine, and 'Do The Wright Thing' with David Wright, which failed to match the popularity of Reyes' spots. However, with some prodding by his teammates, Reyes was encouraged to continue playing with the same energy as he had previously.Pascarelli, Peter (April 19, 2008). \\"It's time for Reyes to be Reyes\\", ESPN.com, Accessed April 19, 2008. On July 3, Reyes' childhood friend Argenis Reyes was called up from the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. When Argenis played, he and Jos√© made up the middle infield for the Mets, with Argenis Reyes at second base. On July 20, Reyes overtook Mookie Wilson as the Mets' all-time triples leader after legging out his 63rd career triple in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. On September 10, Reyes broke the Mets' all-time record for stolen bases, previously held by Mookie Wilson, with his 282nd career stolen base coming in the third inning of a game against the Washington Nationals. After stealing second to break the record, he then stole third and scored the go-ahead run on a single by David Wright. On September 23, 2008, Reyes achieved his first 200-hit season with a bases- clearing triple. He is the second Mets player to reach this landmark, after Lance Johnson in 1996. Reyes finished the season with a batting average of .297, with 72 extra-base hits (including a majors-leading 19 triples), 68 RBIs and 56 stolen bases. A few days before spring training, Mets manager Jerry Manuel announced that he was considering moving Reyes from the leadoff spot to 2nd or 3rd in the line-up. However, Reyes playing in the World Baseball Classic meant his playing time in the Mets training camp was limited, and led to Manuel deciding to move Reyes back to the leadoff spot. Speaking of the decision, Reyes said, \\"That's where I've hit all my life ... I'd like to be a leadoff hitter.\\" On May 3, 2009, Reyes was placed on the DL due to a calf injury. Reyes was expected to be back in early June but when rehabbing the injury he pulled himself from an extended spring training game; an MRI exam the following day revealed the tear, which Reyes confirmed was different than the initial injury. A September return was considered possible but he suffered yet another injury, a torn right hamstring while doing rehab work in August.Rubin, Adam. Mets SS Jose Reyes has completely torn hamstring, might need surgery, New York Daily News. Published August 27, 2009. Retrieved March 10, 2010. 2010 Reyes (left) running to first base in 2011 On March 11, 2010, Reyes was diagnosed with a hyperactive thyroid gland, and was ordered by doctors to cease spring training activity. On March 23, his thyroid levels returned to normal and he was cleared to play. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list and missed the start of the regular season. On May 25, he had his 1000th career hit off of the Phillies' Jamie Moyer. On June 8, Reyes hit a tying home run in the 7th inning with two outs that had to be reviewed. The shot was originally called a double because it bounced back into play. The Mets went on to win the game in the 11th on a walk off shot by Ike Davis. On July 4, Reyes was selected to his third All-Star Game, but he was unable to play due to an injury; Dodgers shortstop Rafael Furcal replaced Reyes. However, Reyes still attended the All-Star Game with his family. 2011 Reyes with the Mets in 2011 On June 28, in his 1,000th career game, Reyes stole his 360th base. This put him in the top 100 all-time in stolen bases. Reyes was voted in as the starting shortstop for the National League in the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. However, he did not participate due to a strained left hamstring. Throughout the 2011 season, there were talks about Reyes' future and if it would be with the Mets. He decided he did not want to talk about it until the end of the season. As well as being a possible top target for teams in free agency, he was reportedly involved in trade talks with multiple teams, but the Mets decided they would hold onto him for the rest of the season and make an effort to re-sign him. Reyes was once again placed on the disabled list due to a strained left hamstring. On the final day of the season, after bunting for a single in his first at bat in the first inning, Reyes asked his manager to remove him from the game, ending his season with a .337 batting average, two points ahead of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers in the race for the NL batting title. Braun went 0‚Äì4 later in the day to finish at .332. Reyes became the first Met in franchise history to win an NL batting title. Reyes's decision came on the 70th anniversary of Ted Williams' refusal to sit out a doubleheader on the last day of the 1941 season, putting his .400 batting average at risk but ultimately hitting 6-for-8 and raising his average from .39955 to .406. Reyes played in 126 games in 2011, the fewest games played by a batting champion since Manny Ramirez's 120 games played in 2002. He became a free agent at the end of the season. Miami Marlins in 2012 Miami Marlins (2012) On December 7, 2011, Reyes agreed to a six-year, $106 million contract with the Miami Marlins. Upon his signing with the Miami Marlins he appeared on MLB Network where he got his haircut and had his signature dreadlocks cut off & removed to coincide with the new change. Reyes had the first Marlins hit at Marlins Park, against Kyle Lohse of the St. Louis Cardinals, breaking up a no-hitter in the 7th inning. On June 7, 2012, Reyes hit his first home run as a Marlins player against the Atlanta Braves. Reyes finished the year 2nd in the NL in triples (12), 2nd in at-bats per strikeout (11.5), and 3rd in steals (40). He hit .287. He split time between the leadoff role and the #3 spot. Toronto Blue Jays (2013‚Äì15) On November 19, 2012, Reyes was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio, in exchange for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson √Ålvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino. Reyes needed to be carted off the field during a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 12, 2013, after hearing a pop in his left ankle while sliding into second. Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 13. On April 15, general manager Alex Anthopoulos reported that an MRI scan revealed no fracture and that no surgery would be required, but that Reyes was expected to miss three months. On April 15, CBS Sports reported that Reyes's ankle injury was less severe than originally thought, reducing his time on the DL to eight weeks, but that was later refuted by Blue Jays management. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list on April 23 to make room for Aaron Laffey. Toronto Blue Jays in 2013 Reyes was held out of baseball activities for several weeks before playing two innings in a simulated game on June 14. He then began a rehab assignment in High-A Dunedin. Reyes played in 3 games and recorded a .417 average with 3 runs scored, 1 RBI and 1 stolen base. Reyes was promoted to Triple-A Buffalo on June 21, and scored the winning run against the Durham Bulls. After playing three games in Buffalo, Alex Anthopolous said Reyes would play another game in Buffalo, followed by a game in Double-A New Hampshire. The plan was for Reyes to then be called up on June 27 when the Blue Jays begin a 4-game series against the Boston Red Sox, however it was later reported that Reyes would be called up one day earlier. Reyes went to Tampa Bay on June 25, rather than going to New Hampshire and was present in the dugout, despite not being able to play. He went 0‚Äì4 in his return to the lineup on June 26, but the Blue Jays won on R.A. Dickey's complete game shutout 3‚Äì0. Reyes recorded his first hit since coming off the disabled list on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox. The hit was also his 1,500th career hit. Reyes played his first game at home since coming off the disabled list on Canada Day and went 3‚Äì5 with a solo home run. On August 2, in a 7‚Äì5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Reyes recorded his 500th career RBI on a two-run home run. In a game against the Seattle Mariners on August 6, Reyes hit his 100th career home run, a solo shot to lead off the game off of F√©lix Hern√°ndez. After experiencing a minor hamstring strain during spring training, Reyes began the 2014 season batting leadoff for the Blue Jays. In his first at bat on Opening Day he aggravated his hamstring injury while running to first base, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list at the end of the game. Reyes was activated on April 19, after playing in two rehab games with the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays. He avoided the disabled list for the rest of the season, playing in 143 games and batting .287 with 9 home runs, 51 RBI, and 30 stolen bases.

His style is often compared to pop art, as well as commercial and comic art of the 1950s and 1960s. Early life Allred was raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints. Upon his parents' divorce, he was raised with his father in Oregon, while his brothers and mother moved to Utah. He considers himself to be a \\"Mormon\\", though a liberal-minded one, and has stated that he still identifies with the beliefs, and considers The Book of Mormon to be a phenomenal and fascinating account. Career Mike Allred began his career as a radio host on KYES AM 950 (KY95) in Roseburg, Oregon. He later became a television reporter in Europe, and started drawing comics in 1989 with the 104-page graphic novel Dead Air (Slave Labor Graphics). The story loosely followed his stint in radio as a sidebar to the true focus of the novel, the effects of post-nuclear war over a small Oregon town. He followed this up with his similarly titled works Graphique Musique (1990) and Grafik Muzik (Caliber Comics 1990‚Äì1991), in which he set out the style that he was to become known for with his most famous character, Madman. Madman first appeared as Frank Einstein in Creatures of the Id and Grafik Muzik published in 1990, but it wasn't until March 1992 that the first Madman miniseries debuted from Tundra Publishing in March 1992. The series gained further recognition with its move to Dark Horse Comics in April 1994, and where it was relaunched as Madman Comics and went on to be nominated for several Harvey Awards. Madman Comics ran for 20 issues and ended in 2000. From 2007‚Äì2009, Image Comics published Madman: Atomic Comics for 17 issues. Allred drew part of the 1993 \\"Worlds' End\\" story arc in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series. Allred appeared as himself in the 1997 feature film Chasing Amy as part of the opening scene at a comic book convention, signing copies of his comic Madman. He also provides the artwork for the fictional comic book Bluntman and Chronic. Allred himself gained further mainstream attention with the science- fiction/rock-and-roll comic Red Rocket 7 (Dark Horse, 1997) and his art for writer Peter Milligan's series X-Force, which he began drawing in July 2001, and subsequently became X-Statix.Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 313: \\"The further adventures of Peter Milligan and Mike Allred's version of X-Force now received a name ‚Äì X-Statix.\\" In 2000, AAA Pop published Allred's The Atomics, featuring a group of beatniks with superpowers. Issue #116 of X-Force, the first collaboration between Allred and Milligan, was the first Marvel comic book to not have the Comics Code Authority stamp of approval since 1971. In 2004 and 2005, Allred wrote and drew The Golden Plates, an adaptation of The Book of Mormon. Allred is a Latter-Day Saint, and completed much of the work on this project in collaboration with his wife Laura Allred. Allred sketching in 2010 Allred worked again with Neil Gaiman in 2009 on the Metamorpho feature in Wednesday Comics. The Madman All-New Giant-Size Super- Ginchy Special! was published in April 2011. Allred and writer Matt Fraction crafted a Fantastic Four spinoff series, FF, in 2013. The following year, Allred and writer Dan Slott launched a new Silver Surfer series at Marvel. His comic book series iZOMBIE, which ran from 2010 to 2012, was adapted into a 2015 television series of the same name. Allred drew the 1960s variant cover for Action Comics #1000 (June 2018). His wife, Laura, frequently works as his colorist. Awards Allred's retro-styled artwork is a frequent nominee for comics awards such as the Harveys, the Eisners, and the Eagles. In his career, he has received: * 2005 Special AML Award for The Golden PlatesAML Awards database.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 9,926. Prior to 2010 the area was part of the Lutherville-Timonium CDP. The Maryland State Fair is held in Timonium each year near Labor Day on the grounds of the former Timonium Race Course, which is an important site along with Pimlico Race Course in northwest Baltimore and Laurel Park in Prince George's County, along with other former tracks at Bowie and Rosecroft in Maryland thoroughbred horse racing traditions. Etymology Timonium takes its name from Timonium Mansion, the home of Mrs. Archibald Buchanan, who, in melancholia due to the loss of eyesight and the death of a close friend, felt her life was like that of Mark Antony after the Battle of Actium.

Originally intended for designs based on the Motorola 6800 CPU and given a related part number, it was more widely used alongside various other processors, and was most commonly found in machines based on the Zilog Z80 and MOS 6502. The 6845 is not an entire display solution on its own; the chip's main function is to properly time access to the display memory, and to calculate the memory address of the next portion to be drawn. Other circuitry in the machine then uses the address provided by the 6845 to fetch the pattern and then draw it. The implementation of that hardware is entirely up to the designer, and varied widely among machines. The 6845 is intended for character displays, but could also be used for pixel-based graphics, with some clever programming. Among its better-known uses is the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, and Videx VideoTerm display cards for the Apple II. It is also part of many early graphics adapter cards for the IBM PC, including the MDA, Hercules Graphics Card (HGC), and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). Its functionality was duplicated and extended by custom circuits in the EGA and VGA PC video adapters. Implementations of the chip by MOS Technology are used in the Commodore 64 and the Commodore 128, in the form of the MOS Technology 6545 and MOS Technology 8568 respectively. Originally designed by Hitachi as the HD46505, Hitachi- built versions are in a wide variety of Japanese computers, from Sony, Sharp, Panasonic, and Casio. It is also known as the 6845 CRTC or the CRTC6845, meaning \\"cathode ray tube controller\\". A common clone of this CRT controller is the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) UM6845E CRT controller. Overview The chip generates the signals necessary to interface with a raster display but does not generate the actual pixels, though it does contribute cursor and video-blanking information to the pixel video (intensity) signals. It is used to produce correctly timed horizontal and vertical sync and provide the address in memory from which the next pixel or set of pixels should be read. The process of reading that value, converting it into pixels, and sending it to a CRT is left to other circuits. Because of this, systems using the 6845 may have very different numbers and values of colors, or may not support color at all. Interlaced and non-interlaced output modes are supported, as is a hardware text cursor. The sync generation includes generation of horizontal and vertical video blanking signals, which are used to condition the external pixel generation circuits. Also, an internal latch is provided which when triggered will duplicate and retain a copy of the video address so that it can later be read back by the CPU. This is useful for light pens and light guns which can function by sending a pulse to the 6845 when the electron beam passes, allowing a running program to read back the location that was pointed at. Because of this feature, most computer video adapters using a 6845 included a light pen interface, though it was usually an internal connector on the board itself, not on the outside of the computer, and it was usually undocumented in the user manual. Because all aspects of video timing are programmable, a single machine can switch between NTSC and PAL timings in software. The 6845 can be used to drive monitors or any other raster display. Internals MC6845 pinout. The chip has a total of registers controlling all aspects of video timings. Only two addresses are exposed to external components - one to select which internal register is to be read or written to and another to access that register. The 6845 is intended for character based displays. Every address it generates is composed of two parts - a 14 bit character address and a 5 bit row address. Using the full address range RA0-RA4:CA0-CA13 the 6845 can address words of memory, where a word may be any number of bits chosen by the system designer as the memory width. If the word size is one byte, as is often the case, the 6845 can address 512 KiB. If the word size is 32 bits, e.g. for 32-bit color graphics with one pixel per word, then the 6845 can address 2048 kiB; for 64-bit words, it can address twice as much. These limits arise from the combination of the 6845 and the design of the external memory connected to it, not from the 6845 alone. Though the number of unique addresses that the 6845 can address is limited to , the amount of memory that the 6845 can address may be significantly larger than might be assumed because the 6845 imposes no limit on the size of each memory location that it addresses. It is also significant that each word addressed by the 6845 does not have to equal one pixel or one character. As an example, consider the use of the 6845 in the IBM CGA, where the word size is one byte and each word represents four or eight pixels in the medium- or high-resolution graphics modes respectively, or one-half character. In CGA alphanumeric (text) mode, there are two bytes per character, accessed sequentially by the 6845--the first byte is a character code byte and the second byte is a character attribute byte. The character address increases linearly. When the chip signals horizontal sync it increases the row address. If the row address does not equal the programmatically set number of rows per character, then the character address is reset to the value it had at the beginning of the scan line that was just completed. Otherwise the row address is reset to zero and the memory address continues increasing linearly. This causes the same sequence of character values to be re-read from the memory for each raster line of each character row, before the 6845 advances the memory address to the next character row and repeats the same pattern. Therefore, if a character occupies one \\"word\\" in the video buffer, a display of l lines and c columns of characters with s scan lines per character requires l √ó c words of memory to represent a full screen of characters but takes s times that many memory accesses to complete one refresh cycle: each line of character words is repeatedly read s times before the next line is read. This means that character displays using the 6845, compared to all-points-addressable graphics displays of the same resolution, require much less memory but still require high memory bandwidth on the order of the bandwidth required for graphics. A different video display controller that buffers one whole line of character data internally can avoid this repeated reading of each line of characters from the display buffer RAM, reducing the required memory bandwidth and allowing either slower, less expensive memory chips to be used, more time for a system CPU to access the memory, or a combination of both. In the 1970s, 1980s, and to a lesser extent the 1990s, memory was expensive, fast memory was especially so, and this was an important concern. In the 1970s and early to mid-1980s, chip circuit densities were not very high either, and putting an 80-byte or larger character buffer into a chip like the 6845 might have enlarged the chip die by 50-100%, in turn making it more expensive by a few times that factor due to the exponential growth of chip defect rates and the consequent decline of production yield with die size. Therefore, adding such a character buffer to the 6845 was not a cost-effective approach when the chip was introduced. Now that memory is very inexpensive, fast memory included, there is little motivation to reduce the memory bandwidth required by a video display controller, so this is no longer an important engineering consideration. At the same time, chip densities have skyrocketed--which is actually the main reason for today's low memory prices--and many chips used in computers have large buffers and caches; a chip like the 6845 designed today could easily use a character line cache to avoid reading and re-reading characters for each video scan line within a character line. For low-power handheld devices, which would be the main ones likely to use character displays now, the power used for high-bandwidth memory access would be good reason to reduce the memory bandwidth for display refresh through the use of a line cache in the display controller. If the character address is used to look up a character reference in RAM and the row address to index a table of character graphics in ROM an ordinary text mode display is constructed. The character reference read from memory must be combined with the row address to form the address for the character graphics ROM, with the character reference selecting a set of scan line patterns that forms one character and the row address indexing into that set to select one scan line. In other words, the ROM address is split into two parts in order to use the ROM as a two- dimensional array: the first dimension selects a character, and the second selects a row of that character's graphic pattern. Linear framebuffers As described above, the 6845 is not ordinarily able to provide large linear framebuffers. A design could use only the character address and set the number of rows per character to 1 but it would be constrained to of addressable memory. A solution is found in the Amstrad CPC, which combines the row address and character address to provide linear scanlines within a non-linear buffer. It maps row address RA0-RA2 to memory address MA11-MA13 and character address CA0-CA10 to memory address MA0-MA10. This has the advantages of easier programming for non-character display and easy smooth horizontal scrolling but can impede smooth vertical scrolling. Differences from the 6545 Although overwhelmingly compatible, a number of small variations exist between the 6845 and 6545. The biggest difference is that the 6545 may be configured so that it has sole access to the address bus for video memory. Two additional registers are included for setting any address the CPU wishes to read and the chip alternates between outputting addresses for display generation and the display set for CPU access. Smaller changes are that the MOS Technology and one variation of the Rockwell 6545 lack interlaced output support and all 6545s include an optional address skew, which delays display enable for one character cycle if set. This second feature was incorporated into later variations of the Motorola 6845. The 6545 may be set to work in linear 14 bit mode using a status bit. On the 6845 the same thing requires adjustment of the character height. Tricks The 6845 reads the start address for its display once per frame. However, if the internal timing values on the chip are altered at the correct time it can be made to prepare for a new frame without ending the current one - creating a non-continuous break in generated addresses midway through the display. This is commonly used by demos and much more rarely games to provide one moving area of the display (usually the play field) and one static (usually a status display). Vertical scrolling appears constrained because only the character start address can be set and the row address is always zeroed at frame start, but by adjusting border times it is possible to shift the position the framebuffer is shown on the raster display for increments in between whole characters. With drawing of blank pixels at the screen edges, this can be made invisible to the user creating just the illusion of a smooth vertical scroll.

Although he did not invent it, it features largely in the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508‚Äì1580) and is almost a trademark of his early career. The true Palladian window is an elaborated version. Overview A corner of the Basilica Palladiana, Vicenza, with Palladian window openings to the loggia. Pair of Palladian windows on wings of south front of Burlington House, Westminster, the earliest appearance of the element in Britain A Venetian window, with blind sides, designed by Isaac de Caus (d.1648)Nicholson, Nigel, Great Houses of Britain, London, 1978, p.125 circa 1647, south front of Wilton House, Wiltshire, England Claydon House (begun 1757), here the Venetian window in the central bay is surrounded by a unifying blind arch The Venetian window consists of an arched central arched light symmetrically flanked by two shorter sidelights. Each sidelight is flanked by two columns or pilasters and topped by a small entablature. The entablatures serve as imposts supporting the semicircular arch that tops the central light. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by Donato BramanteAckerman, Jaaes S. (1994). Palladio (series \\"Architect and Society\\") and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475‚Äì1554) in his seven- volume architectural book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that first appeared in the triumphal arches of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrance to Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism.Andrea Palladio, Caroline Constant. The Palladio Guide. Princeton Architectural Press, 1993. p. 42. According to James Lees- Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodeled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.\\"The earliest example of the revived Venetian window in England\\", Lees-Milne, The Earls of Creation, 1962:100. Palladian window The Palladian window or \\"Palladio motif\\" is Palladio's elaboration of this, normally used in a series. It places a larger or giant order in between each window, and doubles the small columns supporting the side lintels, placing the second column behind rather than beside the first. This is introduced in the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza,Summerson, 129-130 where it is used on both storeys; this feature was less often copied. Here the openings are not strictly windows, as they enclose a loggia. Pilasters might replace columns, as in other contexts. Sir John Summerson suggests that the omission of the doubled columns may be allowed, but \\"the term \\"Palladian motif\\" should be confined\\" to cases where the larger order is present.Summerson, 130 Variant A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.James Lees-Milne 1962:133f.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town and locality in the Shire of Flinders, Queensland, Australia. At the , Hughenden had a population of 1,136.  Geography  Hughenden is situated on the banks of the Flinders River. History The upper Flinders River area has been occupied by the Yirandhali people from around 11,000 years ago. Jirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin. Dalleburra (also known as Dalebura, Dal-leyburra, Yirandali) is a language of North-West Queensland, particularly Lammermoor Station via Hughenden. The Dalleburra language region includes the local government boundaries of the Flinders Shire Council. The region in the vicinity of Hughenden was originally known as Mokana in the Yirandhali language. British occupation began in October 1861 with the expedition group led by Frederick Walker camping near the site of the future township of Hughenden. Pastoralists soon followed and in 1863 Ernest Henry and his cousin Robert Gray established the Hughenden sheep station. Hughenden was named after Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire, England, the home of former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Robert Gray and Ernest Henry both had a family connection with Hughenden Manor. Mary Francis Norris, the daughter of John Norris of Hughenden Manor was Henry's mother and Robert's aunt. The actual town of Hughenden began in 1870 as a barracks for the paramilitary Native Police with sub-Inspector Harry Finch and his six troopers constructing the simple buildings at the junction of Station Creek with the Flinders River. In 1877, William Mark built a pub near the barracks and in August of that year the township site was officially surveyed and allotments made available for purchase. Hughenden Post Office opened on 1 July 1878 (a receiving office had been open from 1874). Hughenden Provisional School opened on 22 April 1880, becoming Hughenden State School in 1884. On 30 January 1968, it was expanded to have a secondary department. In November 1883, \\"Hughenden West Estate\\" made up of 37 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Wilson, Ayton and Ryan of Townsville. A map advertising the auction states the allotments are charmingly situated on high sloping ground, overlooking the Town of Hughenden, within a few minutes walk to the Post and Telegraph Offices, the Court House and the business centre of town. The map also states these residence sites only need the completion of the railway works to enormously increase its value. Hughenden North Provisional School opened , becoming Hughenden North State School on 1 January 1909. Due to low attendances, it closed in 1926. St Francis' Catholic School was opened on 1 October 1900 by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. Torrens Creek near Hughenden is where the Americans stored explosives in World War II. The Americans didn't know of the dangerous bush fires out there. After they put out a fire they went back to camp thinking that the fire was out. However, the fire took hold again without them knowing. They then heard about twelve major explosions in succession; the explosions left craters twenty feet deep. Hot shrapnel covered a wide area and started more fires. In the townships, people said that buildings shook and windows broke, and some people were convinced that an air raid had occurred. Thousands of soldiers and civilians attacked the blaze in an attempt to stop it spreading to fuel dumps, but were unable to control it. When the fire got to the explosives it was so powerful it blew the Americans out of their trucks. Many buildings and shops got burnt down from the spreading fires. However the locals were able to save the post office. A police Constable from Torrens Creek Police was awarded the King's Medal of Bravery. Architectural plans for the two-storey court house drawn up in 1945, a project which was abandoned when it was discovered that the foundations could not support a 2-storey building The partly-built one-storey court house, 1952 In June 1945 it was announced that a new court house would be built in Hughenden in the 1945-1946 financial year with architectural plans drawn up in August 1945. However, it was not until September 1946 that the Executive Council of the Queensland Government approved expenditure of ¬£31,560 for the project. In September 1947, the project stopped because it was determined that the foundations would not support a 2-storey building and that the new court house would have to be redesigned as single-level building. In January 1950, the new plans for the one-storey building were announced and by October that year, the construction was progressing in \\"leaps and bounds\\". A shortage of cement appears to have delayed the project until 10,000 tons of cement was imported from England in January 1951. By January 1952, three- quarters of the framing had been completed while the project was suffering from a shortage of skilled labour and the cost having risen to an estimated ¬£60,000. In October 1954 the court house was described as \\"almost completed\\", but it was not until 1955 that the court house opened. In 1960, the Hughenden branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association opened their hall. On 9 June 2003 in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, Mrs Jean Eva Anderson of Ballater Station of Stamford was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her \\"service to the community of Hughenden, particularly through the Country Womens Association\\". She had given 52 years of service to the Hughenden branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association. Her award was presented to her by the Governor of Queensland, Quentin Bryce. Heritage listings Hughenden has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 25 Gray Street: The Grand Hotel Geography Hughenden is located on the Flinders Highway, west of Townsville and north-west of Brisbane, the state capital. The region around Hughenden is a major centre for the grazing of sheep and cattle. The main feed is annual grasses known as Flinders grass, which grow rapidly on the (by Australian standards) fertile grey or brown cracking clay soils after rain between November and March. However, because the rainfall is extremely erratic ‚Äî at Hughenden itself it has ranged from in 1926 to in 1950 ‚Äî droughts and floods are normal and stock numbers fluctuate greatly. The runoff from the Flinders River is much too erratic to provide a sustainable supply for any crop-growing via irrigation. Climate Hughenden has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSh). Record temperatures have varied from around in the summer months to as low as in winter, but average maximum temperatures are usually a very hot in summer and a very warm in June and July. Minimum temperatures range from in summer to around in winter. On average, a minimum below is recorded once per year. The average annual rainfall is around , of which over three-quarters falls from November to March. Between May and September, rainfall is extremely rare: the median rainfall is zero in August, less than in July and September and less than in April, May, June and October. Variability is extreme, however, and totals as high as occur roughly one year in ten, whilst in the driest years as little as can be recorded. Between December and March, monthly totals can exceed if the monsoon is vigorous,Wilcox, Jacqui and Young, Phillip; Queensland's rainfall history: graphs of rainfall averages, 1880‚Äì1988; published 1991 by Queensland Department of Primary Industries. with the wettest month being January 1984 with . Humidity is generally low except when the monsoon is active, when relatively lower temperatures accompany high humidity. The same applies to cloudiness: in the dry winter months over twenty days are completely clear. Media Hughenden is served by five radio stations. Facilities Hughenden has a visitor information centre, showground, shire hall, and racecourse. The Flinders Shire Council operates the Flinders Shire Public Library at 39 Grey Street. The Hughenden branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association has its rooms at 42 Stansfield Street. Sport Hughenden has a large range of sports on offer, including pony clubs, swimming, lawn bowls, golf, netball, tennis, campdrafting, rugby league, and gymnastics.Hughenden - Community Groups, accessed 4 July 2008. The Hughenden Hawks are the local Rugby League team. The Hughenden Rugby 7's is a popular one day Rugby Union Carnival, run in the town since 2012. Attractions Apart from agricultural business, Hughenden also boasts a replica of the Muttaburrasaurus, a dinosaur, whose bones were discovered in 1963 near Muttaburra ( by road from Hughenden) and some teeth and other bones were also discovered around Hughenden. One reason for fossils being discovered must be the dry climate, which means the rocks are usually bare of vegetation. The town is home to the Hughenden Dinosaur Festival, which attracts tourists and includes entertainment and other events.Events Other annual events include the Hughenden Show, held the first weekend in June; the Hughenden Country Music Festival, held every Easter week end and the Bullride and Race Day which is held in September. The Matron's Ball is also a popular annual event. In August 2008, Hughenden hosted the first Arid Lands Festival and The Great Hughenden Camel Endurance Challenge.Arid Lands Australia Incorporated, accessed 22 March 2008.

The following is a list of historical military colours, standards and guidons in different countries that do not exist today. France Middle Ages Stitching the Standard - oil on canvas (1911) During the Middle Ages, the units had not really colours. They got often the heraldry of their lord. The armies got the fleurdelis√©, a kind of French national flag : blue with lys flowers, because lys flowers were the symbol of France and of the King of France, until the 19th century. The King of France had also an official battle standard, the Oriflamme : a special flag, red with gold, and the motto \\"Montjoie Saint-Denis\\". When the king went to war, he had to take the oriflamme in Saint-Denis, near Paris. The knights, as lords, got their own colours (the member of the capetian dynasty were recognizable because of the lys flower on their family heraldry). The French field units got a white cross, called \\"Croix de France\\" (Cross of France). The English got a red cross. Ancien R√©gime (15th-18th centuries) The French colours of the Ancien R√©gime got the same design : a white cross, the Cross of France (vertical cross, but sometimes it was a St Andrew's cross, like the \\"Royal Deux Ponts\\" R√©giment's flag). The rest of the standard was depending of the regiment. Often, the Cross of France divided the flag in four equal quarters. The quarters could have the same colour (specially for the Marine troops's flags). Sometimes, there were two colours : the top-left and the bottom-right quarters of one colour, the top-right and the bottom-left of another. In the most part of the time, lys flowers were on the Cross of France, with an inscription or a motto. The regiment often got the name of their province : Picardie (the oldest regiment of Europe), Normandie, Piemont, Provence... but were also called with special names, like \\"R√©giment de la Reine\\" (Queen's regiment), which had a dark green and black quartered flag, with the cross of France. Each regiment had its flag. The colonel, at the head of the regiment, had a special flag : it also had the white Cross of France, but the four quarters were white too (white was the colour of the French monarchy). The actual flag of Quebec has exactly the design of the French colours of this time. The same pattern was used by regiments made up of foreign nationals who served with the Royal Army infantry. Revolutionary Army In 1794, the French Army was reorganised following the Revolution. Regiments were renamed demi-brigades, with three battalions in each. The 1st Battalion of each was raised from the volunteers, while the 3rd Battalion were conscripts. These two received identical colours. The 2nd Battalion meanwhile was formed from a regiment of the old Royal Army, and received a different colour from the 1st Battalion. The colours of all of the 2nd Battalions were identical to each other (except for the demi-brigade's number), while the 1st Battalions all received different colours. Imperial Grand Army  In the Imperial Army under Napoleon I, regiments received new colours, which were called aigles (eagles), from the eagle that was mounted atop the pole. The designs differed per speciality.  Infantry  Up to 1812, the colours of infantry regiments resembled the colours of the Revolutionary Army, specifically the 1st Demi-Brigade of infantry, with a white diamond and the corners filled in (from clockwise top left) red-blue-red-blue. The name of the regiment was written in gold on the obverse, and the words Valeur et Discipline, together with the battalion number, on the reverse. The regiment's number was written in gold in the four corners. In 1812, a new pattern of colours was authorised; this used the French Tricolour, fringed in gold, and with various regimental and imperial devices forming a frame around the gold writing. The obverse bore the name of the regiment, while the reverse saw listed its battle honours. However, only those actions in which the Emperor himself had participated were permitted to be displayed, so some regiments had nothing on the reverse of their colours. Only the 1st Battalion of each regiment was issued with this Colour; subsequent battalions were issued with plain, coloured marker flags (a practice that began in 1809); although the regulations issued specifically prohibited the addition of any inscriptions or insignia, many battalions did so to allow them to stand out. *Battalion Flag Colours after 1812 **1st Battalion - Regimental Colour **2nd Battalion - White Flag **3rd Battalion - Red Flag **4th Battalion - Blue Flag **5th Battalion - Green Flag **6th Battalion - Yellow Flag *The regiments of the Imperial Guard were subjected to a similar pattern after 1812, with the 1st Battalion of the senior regiments carrying the regiment's Colour, and subsequent battalions carrying plain red flags with either grenades (for grenadier regiments) or hunting horns (for chasseur regiments) in the centre and at the corners. The Middle and Young Guards infantry carried battalion marker flags as well.  Cavalry, artillery, military trains and engineers  From 1804 to 1812, the cavalry and artillery of the Imperial Army used similar designs for the unit standards. The line heavy cavalry regiments (cuirassiers and carabiniers) and all hussar formations, as well as the foot artillery companies, carried standards with similar inscriptions as the infantry while the line cavalry regiments of dragoons and the lancers and Chasseurs-√†-Cheval, as well as the horse artillery, all had swallowtailed guidons. In 1812 the designs were unified, with both now having unit standards of the same design as the infantry with the battle honours. The regiments of engineers, as well as the pontoon units attached to the artillery, also carried infantry-style colours. The artillery and logistics trains, till 1812, carried swallowtailed guidons due to their mounted role. In 1810, the standards and guidions of Imperial Guard cavalry formations raised before 1809 carried grenades or hunting horns in their colours depending on their role. *French Colours prior to the Revolution *French Colours from the Revolution onwards Germany Kingdom of Prussia King Frederick II - known to history as Frederick the Great - ascended the throne of Prussia in 1740. Shortly thereafter he began to issue colours of a new pattern to the infantry regiments of the Prussian Army. Under the new regulations, each regiment received two flags per battalion. The first battalion carried the King's Colour (leibfahne) and one Regimental Colour (regimentsfahne), while the second battalion carried two regimentsfahnen. The Leibfahne had a white field and the Regimentsfahne had a field in the distinguishing colour of the regiment. In the center of both colours was a circular tablet bearing the crowned Prussian eagle under a scroll inscribed Pro Gloria et Patria (For Glory and Fatherland), all within a wreath surmounted by the royal crown. The corners were decorated with crowned royal cyphers (FR for Fredericus Rex) The colours of the wreath, crown and cyphers could be either gold or silver. Unusually, Prussian infantry colours were longer at the hoist than on the fly, measuring 140 by 120 centimetres. Cords and tassels were silver and black. The colours were made of silk, with insignia painted on. The colours of the regular infantry regiments remained virtually unchanged from 1742 until 1806, when catastrophic defeat at the hands of Napoleon all but destroyed the once-proud Prussian Army. When new flags were issued to the reconstituted army beginning in 1811-12, their design was based on the original pattern, but with a number of modifications. In cavalry formations, the same pattern prevailed, with the 1st Squadron or Battalion of cavalry (Cuirassier and Hussar since 1744) regiments carrying the King's Standard (Leibstandarte) and a Squadron Standard (Eskadronsstandarte). Dragoon regiments had swallowtailed standards (Leibfahne and Eskadronsfahne) in unit colours. The Garde du Corps had a Roman styled vellixum standard carried solely by the 1st squadron, while the other squadrons carried lances with the eagle finial. Third Reich **Army: The pattern of the colours for the German Army of the Third Reich was instituted in 1936. It encompasses a square white flag with a black Iron Cross extending nearly to the edges; the cross has a silver border followed by a thinner black edge and a white fimbriation; in each corner is a black swastika. At the center of the flag is a white disk surrounded by a silver wreath and containing a black (\\"Army type\\") eagle grasping a black swastika. The colour of the background varied depending on the branch of the service. Cavalry and artillery had the same pattern, but as a swallow tailed standarte (standard) rather than an ordinary fahne. **Luftwaffe: The ground troops of the Luftwaffe were given different colours to those of the army. It was either red (for anti-aircraft troops), yellow (for flying units) or green (for field troops), with a black lined white diagonal cross. On the obverse in the centre was an Iron Cross on top of a silver wreath. In each corner was a black swastika, with the whole flag trimmed in silver. The reverse was identical except for a silver (Luftwaffe type) eagle replacing the Iron Cross. **Navy: The colours of the Kriegsmarine were similar in design to those of the Luftwaffe. The flag itself was blue, with a black swastika replacing the eagle. The wreath was gold instead of black, as were the diagonal lines. In the corners were gold anchors (top left, bottom right) and Iron Crosses (top right, bottom left). On the other side was an Iron Cross in the centre, with gold eagles replacing the two Iron Crosses in the corners. The flag was fringed in gold. Similar colours were used by all ground formations of the service, including the naval infantry and artillery. **Waffen SS: The colours awarded to the Waffen SS infantry were completely different from those of the rest of the armed forces. It was essentially the national flag, fringed with gold, with the battalion and regiment numbers in the top left hand corner. Cavalry and motorized formations carried a swallowtailed variant. Mongolia In Mongolia, the Tug is generally regarded as a type of historical military symbol that is the equivalent to a military colour. It is a circular pole with attached horse or yak tail hairs arranged at the top. It was introduced and was flown during the period of the Mongol Empire, and was later adopted by Turco-Mongol, Turkic khanates and the Ottoman Empire. Russia Russian Empire Colours in the Imperial Russian Army were introduced in the 18th century. Large regimental flags were reserved for infantry units while small easy to carry flags were used in the cavalry and horse artillery. Regulations in 1797 were introduced to give the military a guideline when awarding colours. New designs for regular infantry units were made, woth the state color consisting of white with the state emblem and the assigned colors of the company/battalion/regiment using a different emblem. Soviet Union Each unit in the armed forces of the Soviet Union had its own Regimental Colour, which was produced to a standard design from the 1930s onward: *Obverse - red field, a red star yellow bordered and the full name and number of a military unit below. Each unit has its own inscription. *Reverse - red field, a gold hammer and sickle and the motto \\"For our Soviet Motherland!\\" (–ó–∞ –Ω–∞—à—É —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫—É—é —Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω—É!, Za nashu sovyetskuyu rodinu) All the Colours were red with gold fringe and square in form. The Naval Flags used by the Soviet Navy are white with a bottom blue stripe. Above it are the USSR's national symbols, the hammer and the sickle. There are many versions of this naval ensign. Guards Regiments The Colours of those regiments that were classed as 'Guards' was slightly different. These had the portrait of Lenin, the Za nashu motto and the abbreviation \\"USSR\\" (–°–°–°–†) on the obverse and the small star with hammer and sickle in its centre, unit's name and a motto on the reverse. The mottoes were different for different regiments (for example, those regiments made Guards in the Great Patriotic War bore the motto 'Death to the German Invaders!'). Naval Guards units had a Guards ribbon included in the Naval ensign whenever a ship becomes a Guards ship. *Soviet Army colours (In Russian) Spain Kingdom of Spain An army regulation of July 1810 stated that line infantry regiments of the Spanish army would bear two colours. The first battalion would carry the coronela (King's Colour), which was white and bore the Royal Coat of Arms in the centre, sometimes on top of a burgundy Cross, surrounded by various regimental devices, while the second battalion (and independent battalions of light infantry) would carry the sencilla (Regimental Colour), which would have a burgundy cross with the provincial coat of arms at the four corners, and the name of the regiment in the top half. In 1843, the regulations introduced a new pattern for regimental colours, with the sencilla replaced by the batallona. This was a flag that adopted the national colours of red-yellow-red horizontal stripes, with a simplified royal coat of arms in the centre atop a small burgundy cross and the name of the regiment encircling it. Spain under Franco Following the victory of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish army adopted the policy of using only a single colour, the batallona, with the new coat of arms in its centre replacing the Royal arms, and the name of the regiment encircling it.

He stood as a presidential candidate twice during the 1990s and also served as Mayor of Libreville, the capital., Gabonews, January 20, 2006 . From 2002 to 2009 he served in the government of Gabon, holding the rank of Deputy Prime Minister for most of that period. Career Mba Abessole was born at Ngnung- Ako, located in northern Gabon, in 1939. He attended a French seminary and was ordained as a Catholic priest on 30 June 1968. He worked as a priest in Gabon until 1976, when he went to France, where he then lived in exile.\\"Political leadership (Gabon)\\", Jane's, March 5, 2008. As a critic of President Bongo and the single-party regime of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), he sought to stand as a candidate against Bongo in the 1979 presidential election, but was unable to do so. Mba Abessole was the exiled leader of MORENA during the 1980s and argued for peaceful political change in Gabon. President Bongo, hoping to indicate that he was open to reform, allowed Mba Abessole to visit Gabon for a week in May 1989. On that occasion he was \\"treated more as a visiting dignitary than the leader of a suppressed political party\\"; Bongo met with him and said that he would consider Mba Abessole's proposed reforms. This conciliatory attitude from Bongo annoyed some PDG hard-liners.David E. Gardinier, \\"Gabon: Limited Reform and Regime Survival\\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, Westview Press, pages 149-154. Following M'ba Abessole's May 1989 visit, he returned to Gabon on a permanent basis in November 1989. Bongo offered to appoint Mba Abessole as Minister of Justice after the March-April 1990 National Conference, but Mba Abessole refused to participate in the government. In the 1990 parliamentary election, Mba Abessole stood as a MORENA candidate in Libreville. In the first round, he received 49.44% of the vote in his constituency, slightly less than the majority required for a first round victory; suspecting fraud, he refused to participate in the second round and called for a boycott of the second round. On October 5, 1993, Mba Abessole announced his candidacy for the December 1993 presidential election.Africa Research Bulletin (1993), page 11,183. He was the main opposition candidate in the election and placed second with 26.5%, according to official results, while Bongo was credited with a narrow first round majority.Elections in Gabon, African Elections Database.

He also refused to participate in the government of Prime Minister Paulin Obame-Nguema, which was formed after the signing of the Paris Accords between the government and the opposition in October 1994. The RNB won the late 1996 municipal election in Libreville, and Mba Abessole was then elected as Mayor of Libreville by the city councillors on 19 January 1997; he received 68 out of 98 votes. Mba Abessole also stood in the December 1996 parliamentary election as a candidate in the fifth arrondissement of Libreville, but he was defeated by Jean-Fran√ßois Ntoutoume Emane.Country Report: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (1997), page 12. Prior to the December 1998 presidential election, Kombila was expelled from the party in July 1998, leading Kombila's supporters to form their own faction and nominate Kombila as their presidential candidate later in the month.

The resin is one contender for onycha. Onycha (Greek: ŒøŒΩœÖŒæ), along with equal parts of stacte, galbanum, and frankincense, was one of the components of the consecrated Ketoret (incense) which appears in the Torah book of Exodus (Ex.30:34-36) and was used in the Jerusalem's Solomon's Temple. This formula was to be incorporated as an incense, and was not to be duplicated for non- sacred use.Exodus 30:33, 37-38. What the onycha of antiquity actually was cannot be determined with certainty. The original Hebrew word used for this component of the ketoret was ◊©◊ó◊ú◊™, shecheleth, which means \\"to roar; as a lion (from his characteristic roar)\\" or ‚Äúpeeling off by concussion of sound.\\"Strongs #7827 Shecheleth is related to the Syriac shehelta which is translated as ‚Äúa tear, distillation, or exudation.‚ÄùOnkelos Shemot 2:10 In Aramaic, the root SHCHL signifies ‚Äúretrieve.‚Äù When the Torah was translated into Greek (the Septuagint version) the Greek word ‚Äúonycha‚Äù ŒøŒΩœÖŒæ, which means \\"fingernail\\" or \\"claw,\\" was substituted for shecheleth. Contenders for the identity of onycha Operculum Some writers believe that onycha was the fingernail-like operculum, or trap door, of certain sea snails, including Strombus lentiginosus, Murex anguliferus, Onyx marinus, and Unguis odoratus. It may be the operculum of a snail-like mollusk found in the Red Sea.Onycha, Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2008 This operculum is the trap door of a shell, called by the Latins Conchylium. These opercula may be of different sizes, but their overall shape is that of a claw, which is the origin of the name Unguis odoratus. The name Blatta Byzantina is occasioned by its having usually been imported from Constantinople, the ancient Byzantium. In antiquity the operculum was used as an ingredient in incense. The Baylonian Talmud recorded that onycha was rubbed with an alkali solution prepared from the bitter vetch to remove impurities,Rambam on Maaser Sheni 2:4 it was then soaked in the fermented berry juice of the Caper shrub,Babli, Keritut:6a or a strong white wine, in order to enhance its fragrance. The operculum was also commonly used as an ingredient in many East Asian incense. Labdanum There is some doubt as to whether the onycha of the Old Testament was actually the operculum of a sea snail.Encyclopedia of Bible Plants (F Nigel Hepper 1992) H.J. Abrahams says, \\"The widely held mollusk hypothesis becomes quite perplexing if one considers that the mollusk was counted among the unclean animals in the Bible (Chapters Leviticus 11:9 and 12).\\"Abrahams, H.J. - Onycha, Ingredient of the Ancient Jewish Incense: An attempt at identification, Econ. Bot. 33(2): 233-6 1979 Sea creatures such as the mollusk were an ‚Äúabomination‚Äù and even their carcasses were to be considered an ‚Äúabomination‚ÄùEx. 11:10-12 and anyone simply touching them became unclean.11:24 Rabbeinu Bachyei insisted that only kosher species may be used for the mishkan. The Gemara states that ‚Äúonly items that one may eat may be used for the work of Heaven.‚ÄùShabbos 28a Nachmanides, Torah scholar and famed Jewish theologian, emphasized that the commandment concerning unclean animals pertained also to temple services.Abrahams, HJ, Pg 234 James Strong and J. McClintoch write that ‚Äúit seems improbable that any such substance could have been one of the constituent spices of the most holy perfume; not only because we know of none bearing any powerful and agreeable odor, but specially because all marine creatures that were not finned and scaled fishes were unclean, and as such could not have been touched by the priests or used in the sanctuary.‚ÄùCyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 7, by James Strong John McClintockKumph, A mboinischeRaritdten-Kammer, cap. xvii, p. 48 (the German ed.

Coincidentally onycha is the Greek word which was chosen to replace the original Hebrew word which was shecheleth. One of the Hebrew words that shecheleth seems to be related to, ◊©◊ó◊ú◊ô◊ù, sh'chalim, refers to a large variety of plants.James L. Carroll, Elizabeth Siler, \\"Let My Prayer Be Set Before Thee: The Burning of Incense in the Temple Cult of Ancient Israel\\" An ancient Ugaritic text lists onycha among types of vegetables, implying that onycha was a vegetable also.James L. Carroll, Elizabeth Siler The Talmud specifically states that although onycha (shecheleth) is not from a tree, it does grow from the ground and that it is a plant (Kerithoth 6b).Abrahams, H.J. - Onycha, Ingredient of the ancient Jewish incense: An attempt at identification in Econ. Bot. 33(2): 233-6 1979 There is also some doubt that a mollusk would have been referred to as a \\"sweet spice\\" in Exodus 30, since it is the shell of a creature and not an aromatic or pungent vegetable substance.Exodus 30:34b Condor writes ‚ÄúShecheleth, Exod. xxx. 34; [is] rendered by the Septuagint, onycha, and by the Arabic version, ladana . . . The root of the Hebrew word means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.‚Äù Josiah Conder. The modern traveller (Volume 7) James Strong writes \\"the Syriac etymology of the word, namely, to run in drops, exude, distil, would lead to the idea of a resinous and odoriferous substance of the vegetable kingdom.\\" Another writer says ‚Äúthe context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant, perhaps gum-ladanum. The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.‚ÄùHagensick, Carl, Beauties of the Truth, Volume 4, Number 2, May 1993 \\"Shecheleth\\" identifies with the Syriac \\"shehelta\\" which is translated as ‚Äúa tear, distillation, or exudation.\\" According to Winifred Walker's All the Plants of the Bible, shecheleth is a form of rock rose (also known as the Rose of Sharon), Cistus ladaniferus var. Cistus creticus, which produces a resin called labdanum.Walker, Winifred, \\"All the Plants of the Bible,\\"Doubleday & Company (October 1979) This sweet spicy ingredient has been used in perfumes and incense for thousands of years and grows profusely in the Middle East, specifically in Israel and Palestine. The rock rose is a bush, not a tree (the Talmud states that onycha comes from a ground plant and not a tree) Kerithoth 6b which bears flowers widely noted for the markings upon its petals resembling human fingernails. Labdanum is the gray-black resin that exudes from the branches of the rock rose bush. Labdanum, after it matures, becomes black and is referred to as black amber or black balsam.Chemical abstracts, Volume 13, By American Chemical Society,Chemical Abstracts Service, pg.2104 Gill states that the word \\"shecheleth is certainly related to the Hebrew word shechor (black),\\" denoting the color of the shecheleth used in the ketoret formula.Gil Marks http://www.gilmarks.com/1215.html Onycha is a play on the word onyx which was a gem. The onyx most esteemed by the ancients was the black gem.Cyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature,James Strong, John McClintock The Hebrew word for onyx was shoham and ‚ÄúBraun traces shoham to the Arabic sachma,'blackness:' 'Of such a color,' says he, 'are the Arabian [onyxes], which have a black ground-color.' This agrees essentially with Charles William King's remarksAntique Gems, p. 9. 'The Arabian species,' he says, 'were formed of black or blue strata.‚ÄùCyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 7, by James Strong, John McClintock The rock rose also has an inseparable identification with rocks because its existence depends upon its roots anchoring among them in areas where no other foliage is able to grow.

After diligent reflection on all these diverse options, there is little doubt in my mind that onycha of Exodus 30:34 is labdanum. Saadya's labdanum is not only ideally suited for use in incense, but it is also a product of the Jewish homeland.\\" Lesser recognized contenders There are several lesser recognized contenders for the title \\"Onycha\\" which should also be mentioned here: Benzoin The internationally renowned Bible scholar Bochart stated, at one point in his research, that onycha was actually benzoin, a gum-resin from the Styrax species. H.J. Abrahams states that the use of benzoin in the Biblical incense is not inconceivable since Syro-Arabian tribes maintained extensive trade routes prior to Hellenism. Styrax Benzoin was available via import to the biblical lands during the Old Testament era. Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE indicates that different kinds of styrax resins were traded. Styrax benzoin was used by the ancient Egyptians in the art of perfumery and incense. The apothecary of Shemot (book of Exodus) would have been familiar with its aromatic uses. S. benzoin has a history steeped in antiquity and was once employed as an incense in Egypt. All the compounds identified in benzoin resin were detected in an archaeological organic residue from an Egyptian ceramic censer, thus proving that this resin was used as one of the components of the mixture of organic materials burned as incense in ancient Egypt.Journal of Chromatography A Volume 1134, Issues 1-2, 17 November 2006, Pages 298-304, Aromatic resin characterisation by gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry: Raw and archaeological materials, Francesca Modugnoa, Erika Ribechinia and Maria Perla Colombini, a Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Universit√† di Pisa, via Risorgimento 35-56126 Pisa, Italy An ancient Egyptian perfume formula (1200 BCE) contained benzoin as one of its chief ingredients.Aromatherapy: A Complete Guide to the Healing Art, By Kathi Keville, Mindy Green The name \\"benzoin\\" is probably derived from Arabic lubƒÅn jƒÅwƒ´ (ŸÑÿ®ÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ÿßŸàŸä, \\"Javan frankincense\\"); compare the mid-eastern terms \\"gum benjamin\\" and \\"benjoin\\". The word 'Storax' is an alteration of the Late Latin styrax. In the Orphic hymns it is œÉœÑœåœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ or œÉœÑœåœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±. As pointed out earlier, the original word shecheleth was replaced with onycha by the Septuagint translation. Onycha in turn is derived from the onyx stone meaning \\"fingernail\\". Conder writes that \\"the root of the Hebrew word [shecheleth] means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.‚Äù Another writer says that the Hebrew shecheleth identifies with the Syriac shehelta which is translated as ‚Äúa tear or distillation‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant . . . The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.‚Äù The book of Ecclesiasticus lists storax as one of the ingredients when alluding to the sacred incense of the biblical tabernacle.Ecclesiasticus 24:15 The Hindustanis use Benzoin to burn in their temples‚Äîa circumstance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that benzoin is part of the incense formula of Exodus.Cyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 9, By John McClintock, James Strong The infrequent mention of benzoin by name in antiquity is quite suspicious considering its importance in ancient recipes.Calcott, Maria, A Scripture Herbal, London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, Paternoster-Row, 1842 It stands to reason it must have been known by another name not currently used today. References to it by name are conspicuously missing also from the Old Testament. Callcott writes ‚ÄúIt has been suggestedBy C.H., Esq. that Gum Benzoin, which is not mentioned by any other name in scripture, must be onycha. Its fracture has exactly the lustre required by the name. . . The gum is a secretion of the bark, and is of great efficacy in healing wounds. . . Such are the pretensions of the Benzoin to be looked upon as the true Onycha, which, from the text, as I have already said, must have been some fragrant vegetable gum in itself, of foreign production, and ranking with stacte, and myrrh, and galbanum . . . all which conditions are fulfilled by the Gum Benzoin.‚ÄùCalcott, Maria, A Scripture Herbal, London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, Paternoster-Row, 1842 Dioscorides and Galen describe two kinds of bdellium, the second of which is Benzoin, according to Hardouin and Sprengel.Smith, William George, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities Pererra describes benzoin tears as \\"flattened pieces, some of which are angular, and the larger of them . . . an inch in length\\".The Elements of materia medica and therapeutics, Volume 2 By Jonathan Pereira He says that \\"externally, these pieces are shiny.\\" This description most certainly fits well with the interpretation of \\"onycha\\" which means \\"fingernail.\\" He continues to say many of the pieces \\"are of an amber or reddish-yellow colour\\" and continues to describe parts of it as \\"translucent or milky, and frequently striped.\\" This is a good description of the appearance of various onyx stones, from which the name onycha is derived. He says that many tears of Styrax benzoin \\"are translucent, or, in a few cases, almost transparent.\\"Pereira One type of benzoin has \\"numerous, white, small pieces . . . intermingled, which thereby give the broken surface a speckled appearance\\" which he calls \\"marbly.\\" As mentioned above, although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning \\"nail\\" it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx. Onyx comes in a variety of colors the most prominent being either the black and veined striped gem or the pinkish translucent striped gem. One related Styrax is black and the benzoin discussed thus far seems to be of the pinkish, translucent sort. Steeping Styrax benzoin tears in wine can enhance its fragrance as well as its translucent qualities and \\"shiny\\" appearance, thus making it appear even more like the onyx gem. Rambam stated that soaking onycha in wine made it beautiful.Kerithoth 6a; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:5 Benzoin tears look very different from other resins and appear to be small stones rather than the vegetable product that it is. Rashi writes that onycha was a root from the ground. Benzoin almonds do not resemble the resins they actually are but appear as a rough stony almonds. Not being native to Palestine they could easily have been mistaken as portions of a root since they do not seem to adequately resemble any other portion of a plant body. However it seems that the root of benzoin was also used. The ancient Greeks and Romans used benzoin root in a seasoning sauce for a meat boiled in sweet herbs.Soyer, Alexis, The Pantropheon: A History of Food and Its Preparation in Ancient Times A Roman supper sometimes included shellfish prepared with pepper, cinnamon, and benzoin root.The Eclectic Review: N.S. V. 19 1823 Jan-Jun, University of Michigan Library (April 27, 2009) Benzoin root was also used in a recipe for seasoning goose liver.Remains, Historical & Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester, Chetham Society Benzoin root is still used today in incense recipes.http://www.starbornalchemy.com/perfumeoil.html Also the resin proper is procured near the root of the tree.Herb Data New Zealand, Benzoinum, Monograph of the U.S.D. 1926, Edited by Ivor Hughes Resin procured from the tree during the first three years is referred to as head benzoin. That which is obtained during the next 7 or 8 years is known as the belly benzoin. The third type is called foot benzoin, and is obtained by splitting the tree and scraping the wood of the trunk and roots. This latter source contains impurities. Rambam says that onycha was rubbed with bitter vetch to remove impurities. The Talmud also appears to indicate that onycha came from an annual plant. Benzoin gum is harvested annually, and not being native to Palestine it is possible confusion slipped in identifying its annual yield with its life span. Different Styrax trees are often misidentified or referred to as a \\"bush.\\"http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/plants/styrax- officinalis-californica Onycha is said to have been soaked in wine to enhance its fragrance which was often done with resins used for incense.Kerithoth 6a; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:5 The Hindustanis refer to benzoin as ‚Äúlobanee‚Äù or ‚Äúluban‚Äù.

Araby the blest: studies in Arabian archaeology, By Daniel T. Pottshttp://www.cookingwiththebible.com/reader/Default.aspx/GR3410-4252/lore/ Onycha may have been labdanum. Since myrrh was often mixed with labdanum,Stewart, David, Healing Oils of the BibleMerriam-Webster Dictionary, Myrrh throughout many centuries benzoin and labdanum may have inadvertently switched places in the formula.Tucker, A.O., Frankincense and Myrrh ‚Äì Economic botany, 1986 The possibility exists that the onycha of Exodus 30 was labdanum while the onycha of the second Temple was benzoin, with both ingredients still remaining in both formulas. Winifred Walker writes that the onycha referred to in Exodus 30 is labdanumWalker, Winifred, All the Plants of the Bible, pg.158 but later in the same book states that there was also another onycha, which he also equates as a component of the holy incense, which may have been derived from benzoin.Walker, Winifred, All the Plants of the Bible, pg.241 Labdanum and benzoin mixed Labdanum and benzoin were often mixed together. The reproduced scent of ambergris is predominantly a mix of labdanum and benzoin. Ambergris was used by the ancient Egyptians as an incense.Brady, George Stuart; Clauser, Henry R.; Vaccari, John A. (2002). Materials Handbook: An Encyclopedia for Managers, Technical Professionals, Purchasing and Production Managers, Technicians, and Supervisors. United States: McGraw-Hill Professional. p. 64. . For centuries, benzoin has been mixed with labdanum, particularly in the Middle East, as an incense to scent homes, places of worship, and as an air purifier.http://www.historykb.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/ancient-egypt/54/Kyphi- receipe-by-V-Loret#aa1e8972ce917uwe This blend was used by the ancient Egyptians as an incense. Based on some of the latest research from the Edfu temple and a recent study of ceramic dishes used in the preparation of kyphi, it appears that labdanum mixed with benzoin was an important part of the kyphi recipe. It was also part of the formula written about by Nostradamus who said it made ‚Äúthe most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world‚Äù and that it acted as an air purifier against disease.Nostradamus, Trait√© des fardemens et confitures, Part 1 Chapter XI It is possible that onycha was this mix of labdanum and Styrax benzoin. Styrax (referred to as storax in antiquity) is mentioned alongside of onycha in Eccesiasticus 24:15 when alluding to the sacred incense. Either onycha and styrax were originally mixed together or styrax was treated with labdanum or by the time of the first temple period a fifth ingredient was added to the ketoret.Taylor's edition of Calmet's great dictionary of the Holy Bible, by Augustin Calmet, Charles Taylor, Edward Wells Stacte may have been light myrrh treated with benzoin. Again, the possibility exists that the onycha of Exodus 30 was labdanum, while the onycha of the second Temple was benzoin or even the operculum. Bdellium Commiphora wightii, syn. C. mukul: Bdellium has been seriously considered as the ancient onycha. The tree, which grows in Arabia, produces a gum that was used in antiquity as an incense. It was one of the substances used in incense in ancient Egypt. As an incense it produces a sweet, spicy smell that some consider similar, although less bitter than, myrrh, combined with the scent of mushroom. The gum was often used as an adulterant of myrrh in the spice trade. The gum rolled into a small ball is known as hadrabolon. It is dry and shining having numerous white spots, like finger-nails in shape.Natural History 12.19 Dioscorides said that bdellium was \\"the tear of an Arabian tree.\\"\\"De Materia Medica,\\" i. 80Jewish Encyclopedia,Morris Jastrow Jr. and Immanuel Benzinger He describes bdellium as resembling a fingernailDe materia medica, A, 67 (which is the Greek meaning of onycha). Pliny says that bdellium \\" is shining and dry, and covered with numerous white spots resembling the fingernails.\\"Report by Dr. M. C. Cooke, on the gums, resins, oleo-resins, and resinous Products in the India Museum, or Produced in India, by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, John Forbes WatsonHistoria Naturalis This appears to be the same bdellium referred to by Damocritus, a medical writer, who was quoted by Saracenus in his Scholia in Dioscoridis, and the same bdellium referred to by Galen, as quoted by Salmasius in his Plinianae Exercitationes. Salmasius states that bdellium is the Arab Molochil (Mukul). When used in sacred rites, bdellium was steeped in wine to increase its fragrance (Rambam says that shecheleth, or onycha, was steeped in wine to enhance its fragrance).Kerithoth 6a; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:5 The gum exudes from the cracks in the bark of the trunk near the root (Rashi refers to onycha, or shecheleth, as a kind of root). Bdellium is referred to in the early history of the Bible. Bdellium, like onyx, is the name both of an odoriferous gum and also of a gem or precious stone. \\"And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\\" (Gen 2:12) Gum tragacanth After gum tragacanth is harvested, it takes on the appearance of grotesque \\"fingernails.\\" It had been used for thousands of years as an ingredient in incense, and has been seriously considered as a likely candidate for onycha. Cloves Cloves or \\"zipporen\\" in Hebrew, have been considered as a possibility. In contemporary Hebrew the word means \\"nails\\". Amber It was the opinion of K.G. Jacob that shecheleth was amber.Encyclopaedia Biblica : a critical dictionary of the literary, political, and religious history, the archaeology, geography, and natural history of the Bible, Edited by T.

(SGI) to replace their earlier Indy series. Like the Indy, the O2 used a single MIPS microprocessor and was intended to be used mainly for multimedia. Its larger counterpart is the SGI Octane. The O2 was SGI's last attempt at a low-end workstation.  Hardware  System architecture Originally known as the \\"Moosehead\\" project, the O2 architecture featured a proprietary high-bandwidth Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) to connect system components. A PCI bus is bridged onto the UMA with one slot available. (includes photos) It had a designer case and an internal modular construction. Two SCSI drives could be mounted on special caddies (1 in the later R10000/R12000 models due to heat constraints) and an optional video capture / sound cassette mounted on the far left side. CPU The O2 comes in two distinct CPU flavours; the low-end MIPS 180 to 350 MHz R5000- or RM7000-based units and the higher-end 150 to 400 MHz R10000- or R12000-based units. The 200 MHz R5000 CPUs with 1 MB L2-cache are generally noticeably faster than the 180 MHz R5000s with 512 KB cache. There is a hobbyist project that has successfully retrofitted a 600 MHz RM7xxx MIPS processor into the O2. Memory There are eight DIMM slots on the motherboard and memory, and all O2s are expandable to 1 GB using proprietary 239-pin SDRAM DIMMs. The Memory & Rendering Engine (MRE) ASIC contains the memory controller. Memory is accessed via a 133 MHz 144-bit bus, of which 128 bits are for data and the remaining for ECC. This bus is interfaced by a set of buffers to the 66 MHz 256-bit memory system. I/O I/O functionality is provided by the IO Engine ASIC. The ASIC provides a 33-bit PCI-X bus, an ISA bus, two PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse, and a 10/100 Base-T Ethernet port. The PCI-X bus has one slot, but the ISA bus is present solely for attaching a Super I/O chip to provide serial and parallel ports. Disks Rear view of an SGI O2 The O2 carries an UltraWide SCSI drive subsystem (Adaptec 7880). Older O2's generally have 4x speed Toshiba CD-ROMs, but any Toshiba SCSI CD-ROM can be used (as well as from other manufacturers, the bezel replacement however is designed to fit Toshiba design and also IRIX cannot utilize CD-DA mode other than Toshiba). Later units have Toshiba DVD-ROMs. The R5000/RM7000 units have two available drive sleds for SCA UltraWide SCSI hard-disks. Because the R10000/R12000 CPU module has a much higher cooling-fan assembly, the R10000/R12000 units have room for only one drive-sled. Graphics The O2 used the CRM chipset specifically developed by SGI for the O2. It was developed to be a low-cost implementation of the OpenGL 1.1 architecture with ARB image extensions in both software and hardware. The chipset consists of the microprocessor, and the ICE, MRE and Display ASICs. All display list and vertex processing, as well as the control of the MRE ASIC is performed by the microprocessor. The ICE ASIC performs the packaging and unpacking of pixels as well as operations on pixel data. The MRE ASIC performs rasterization and texture mapping. Due to the unified memory architecture, the texture and framebuffer memory comes from main memory, resulting in a system that has a variable amount of each memory. The Display Engine generates analog video signals from framebuffer data fetched from the memory for display. Operating systems Several operating systems support the O2: *IRIX 6.3 or 6.5.x (native platform). *Linux port is working, but some drivers are missing. Both Gentoo and Debian have releases that work on the O2. See the IP32 port page on linux-mips.org. * OpenBSD has run on the O2 since OpenBSD 3.7. See the sgi port page. * NetBSD has run on the O2 since NetBSD 2.0. It was the first Open Source operating system to be ported to the O2 NetBSD ported to SGI O2. See the sgimips port page.  Performance  The SGI O2 has an Imaging and Compression Engine (ICE) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for processing streaming media and still images.Kilgard, Mark J. (1997). \\"Realizing OpenGL: Two implementations of one architecture\\". 1997 SIGGRAPH/Eurographics Workshop, pp. 45-55. ICE operates at 66 MHz and contains a R3000-derived microprocessor serving as the scalar unit to which a 128-bit SIMD unit is attached using the MIPS coprocessor interface. ICE operates on eight 16-bit or sixteen 8-bit integers, but still provides a significant amount of computational power which enables the O2 to do video decoding and audio tasks that would require a much faster CPU if done without SIMD instructions. ICE only works with the IRIX operating system, as this is the only system that has drivers capable of taking advantage of this device. The Unified Memory Architecture means that the O2 uses main memory for graphics textures, making texturing polygons and other graphics elements trivial. Instead of transferring textures over a bus to the graphics subsystem, the O2 passes a pointer to the texture in main memory which is then accessed by the graphics hardware. This makes using large textures easy, and even makes using streaming video as a texture possible. Since the CPU performs many of geometry calculations, using a faster CPU will increase the speed of a geometry-limited application. The O2's graphics is known to have slower rasterization speed than the Indigo2's Maximum IMPACT graphics boards, though the Maximum IMPACT graphics is limited to 4 MB of texture memory, which can result in thrashing, whereas the O2 is limited only by available memory. While CPU frequencies of 180 to 400 MHz seem low today, when the O2 was released in 1996, these speeds were on par with or above the current offerings for the x86 family of computers (cf. Intel's Pentium and AMD's K5).  Uses  O2s were often used in the following fields: * Imaging (especially medical) * On-air TV graphics; the most widespread example of an O2 running TV graphics is the Weather Star XL computer for The Weather Channel * Desktop workstation * 3D modelling * Analogue video post-production * Defense industries References External links * SGIstuff: O2 * Remotely installing SGI IRIX 6.5 from a GNU/Linux server * SGI O2 Power Supply basics O2 ","title":"SGI O2"},{"id":"1109756","text":"Orrville may refer to: *Orrville, Alabama *Orrville, Indiana *Orrville, Ohio  See also  * Orville (disambiguation) ","title":"Orrville"},{"id":"1109757","text":"In the Mahabharata epic, Pandu ( PƒÅ·πá·∏çu, lit. yellowish, whitish, pale) was the king of Hastinapur, the son of Ambalika and Vichitravirya. He is popularly known as the father of the Pandavas, who were called so after him. Pandu was responsible and a great warrior, who expanded his kingdom during his rule.  Birth  When Vichitravirya died of having sickness, Bhishma unable to take the throne because of his vow, and Bahlika's line unwilling to leave Bahlika Kingdom, there was a succession crisis in Hastinapur. Satyavati then invited her son Vyasa to impregnate the queens Ambika and Ambalika under the Niyoga practice. When Vyasa approached Ambalika, she was frightened by his scary appearance, she had become pale in disgust; hence, her son was born pale. Thus Pandu's name means pale. Reign and marriage Pandu was taught in the fields of archery, politics, administration and religion by Bhishma. He was an excellent archer and Maharathi (warrior). He became the successor to his kingdom and was crowned King of the Kuru Kingdom. He was married to Kunti, the adoptive daughter of Kuntibhoja and the daughter of Shurasena (father of Vasudeva Anakadundubhi and grandfather of Krishna). His second wife was the princess of the Madra kingdom Madri. left Pandu later conquered the territories of the Sindhu Kingdom, Kashi, Anga, Trigarta Kingdom, Kalinga, Magadha, etc., and thus re-established their supremacy over all the kings and increased the span of his empire. Kindama's Curse While hunting in a forest (looking from a distance, his vision partially obscured by plants and trees), Pandu saw a couple of deer in the process of coitus, and shot arrows at them; only to find out that it was Rishi Kindama and his wife who were making love in the form of deer. The dying sage placed a curse on Pandu, since he had not only killed them in the midst of lovemaking, but was not remorseful for his action. King Pandu argued with sage Kindama by misquoting sage Agastya's ruling on the right of Kshatriyas' on hunting. Sage Kindama then cursed Pandu, the curse being that were he to approach his wives with the intent of making love, he would die. Exile and death left Upset and seeking to repent his action, Pandu handed his kingdom to Dhritarashtra and went for exile in forest. There, he lived as an ascetic with his wives. Birth of Pandu's sons Pandu requests Kunti for a son One day Pandu was telling his birth story and wish of becoming a father to Kunti. Kunti mentioned her mantra given by sage Durvasa. Pandu was overjoyed and told Kunti to use it to get a son from suitable god. He wanted his son to be righteous, so he suggested Dharmaraja, god of Death and Righteousness. Kunti used her mantra and the god granted her Yudhishthira. Later Pandu expressed his desire for a powerful son. This time Kunti called Vayu and Bhima was born. Later Pandu suggested Kunti to invoke Indra and a skillful son, Arjuna was born. Pandu felt bad for Madri and he requested Kunti to share her mantra. Kunti share her mantra once and Madri invoked Ashvins, and gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva. Death One day, Pandu forgot about this curse and suddenly filled with lust for Madri and embraced her. After the act, his curse fulfilled and he died. His dead body was cremated in the forest itself. In grief that her husband died because of her, Madri committed suicide after handing her children to Kunti.

It has around 10,000 members.http://www.ssu.se/politik/organisation The president has been Philip Botstr√∂m, since August 2015.  Organization  The members form local clubs, but also belong to a municipal organisation (SSU-kommun) that are grouped together in regional organisations, in general following the county subdivisions, with the exceptions Stockholm County (two districts: Stockholm and Stockholms L√§n) and V√§stra G√∂taland County (five districts: Fyrbodal, G√∂teborg, G√∂teborgsomr√•det, S√∂dra √Ñlvsborg, Skaraborg). Every second year, the national organisation holds a congress, adopting policy documents and electing a national Board. The national head office is situated in S√∂dermalm in central Stockholm. The Swedish Social Democratic Youth League belongs to the Young European Socialists (YES) and the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).  History   Beginning  The Youth League was established in 1917 after the former Youth League, the Social Democratic Youth (SDUF), in the party split and formed the Swedish Social Democratic Left. That division was between the left and right factions that the social democracy across Europe went through. Per Albin Hansson led the fight against Zeth H√∂glund and the left wing that had won a majority at the SDUF Congress 1910 which voted to remove Hansson from the Board. The party's leader and then President Hjalmar Branting supported Hansson, and the party's board demanded a loyalty statement from the Youth League. The Youth League did not accept the statement's wording requiring it to be \\"...ready at all times to promote the party's activities in full compliance with the party and its subdivisions decisions\\", because the organisation believed this was intended to silence opposition within the party. They called this ultimatum a Muzzled Charter. Then the split came, and the Youth League was forced to leave the party when a majority (136 votes against 42) at the Social Democratic Party Congress in 1917, voted in favour of Brant's proposal and adopted a resolution which separated the then the Youth League from the Social Democratic Party SAP. A new Youth League, the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (SSU), was formed at the Congress 27‚Äì28 October 1917 when 45 representatives met in Stockholm people's houses. The participants included Per Albin Hansson, and Gustav M√∂ller. One of the major points in Congress was the issue of women's suffrage.  1930s  SSU's membership grew during the crisis years in the 1930s. Recognising that the members should be trained, it purchased a farm at Bommersvik in order to form a union school. During this period, SSU had over 100,000 members.  1940s  By the 1940s, SSU became a national, fully functioning organization, and became closer to its parent organization. SSU criticized Nazism during the 1940s, helped refugees and had lectures about Nazism crimes. Willy Brandt lectured on the subject of Bommersvik.  1950s  The big question for SSU during the 1950s was whether Sweden should have nuclear weapons. Bertil L√∂fberg argued in favour of atomic weapons, and was opposed by Oskar Lindkvist. The party made efforts to reform itself during this period, and tried to build a folkhemmet, a concept similar to that of the Welfare State. SSU began to campaign on ways to solve the housing crisis, and ideas about housing policies that led to 'one million program' began to emerge.  1960s  The presidents Ingvar Carlsson (1961‚Äì1967) and Bosse Ringholm (1967‚Äì1972) characterized this period as a time of success for Sweden, and social reforms could proceed rapidly. During this time, international issues became important, because SSU saw great injustice, especially abroad. It criticized foreign dictatorships and wars, including the Vietnam War. SSU felt obliged to fight for democratic socialism. Ringholm said about this time: \\"An important task for SSU was to keep clean to the left and ensure that SSU is not ground into sects to the left of social democracy\\". The Federal Board did not agree on how to respond to the Vietnam War. Everyone wanted to criticize the U.S., but Ingvar Carlsson and Ringholm wanted at the same time not be associated with the Communists in North Vietnam. Olof Palme believed that there was no risk that SSU would be misunderstood. The Board decided not to give any directives, but left it to each member / municipality / district to himself to decide whether it wanted to demonstrate against the Communists.  1970s  After the left wing lost several congresses in 1972, they started organizing themselves as the Thursday Club. Thursday Club's name came from the 40 left-wing delegates who met on a Thursday in Congress in 1972 and decided to maintain contact, including through political seminars, until the next congress. After a while, this group dispersed and a small group began to gather behind the newspaper offensive, which started in 1973. In 1976, it was revealed that secret Trotskyite activities had occurred within the SSU, but it would take four years before this could be proved. The proof finally came when two female members independently told the Board. Lars Engqvist, SSU's President 1972‚Äì1978, campaigned in the SSU to try to get a majority vote for an exclusion of these people but the evidence was not strong enough. In the autumn of 1976, seven members were excluded. At the Congress in 1978, enforced decisions about exclusion and a debate began on the offensive. The question of whether they were in the SSU shared federation. Lars Engqvist severely criticized an offensive in Congress. The board was shown to have a clear majority for exclusion. 1975‚Äì1977 was Jerry Smith, President of the IUSY, was the first Swede to the post and was elected to Congress in Brussels in Belgium. Nuclear energy was a major political issue in the 1970s, which would later lead to a referendum in 1980.  1980s  In 1980, it was clear that the hidden organization existed and that it had about 100 members of the organization in ten departments, and three people who worked full-time for the organization. Chairman Jan Nygren (1978‚Äì1984) said: \\"It was pure James Bond story. In one of the papers, I saw my own name and a report on a conversation with me. It was about SSU's military service activities and how we would activate SSU: are in the military. Then I could understand mentally that it was not something Fuales\\". Some exclusions came as a result. Lars Engqvist and later Jan Nygren stressed that they were not trying to silence the opposition. The Congress in 1981, it was established that they had to clear out Trotskyists from SSU. The left-wing was afraid that a purge would be used by the right-wing to remove those that the latter did not like. Over 100 members were excluded. The Congress in 1981 was also the basis for a compromise between the factions in SSU. Bo Bernhardsson won the vote on the Federal secretarial post. Chairman Jan Nygren, who was re-elected, and Bernhardsson came after some mutual distrust, cooperated and fighting in the Federation calmed down. This solution was repeated at the 2005 congress when the president and secretary were taken from a separate wing in order to calm conflicts in the organization. The Mother Party decided to exclude the same on the party's meeting in April 1982. SSU published a book, 'Entrismen in Sweden 'of the SSU' by Anders Lidstr√∂m and Henry Ohlsson where it criticized the newspaper offensive. At the 1984 Congress, Anna Lindh was elected new president. Her time as chairman was marked by peace in League and she was SSU's first female president. She received SSU to test new methods to change society. 1989 had the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) Congress on Bommersvik. Sven Eric S√∂der was elected president of the IUSY for the years 1989‚Äì1991.  1990s  At the 1990 Congress, Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson was elected Chairman. The internal fighting was not strong. The right-wing won an election in 1991, and SSU was in opposition. Between 1991 and 1993, SSU's membership increased. I Sec (then Czechoslovakia) 1991 Roger Hallberg was elected President of the IUSY. The country has never had the presidency two terms of office. In 1994, SSU's website was launched. In 1995, the first Congress in Norrk√∂ping elected Niklas Nordstrom as Chairman. Also that year, the current conflict between the factions emerged. The party's right-wing wanted to distance itself from communism, for example, by leaving behind the symbols and words that can be related to Communism. This was largely because the Soviet Union had fallen and that abuses in the Eastern Bloc damaged the reputation of democratic socialism. The left-wing thought that it would be contrary to the traditions within the movement; it would be a betrayal of the foundations to move that way. This conflict persisted into the 2000s. In 1996, the Federal distance from the Socialist newspaper (run by people active from the newspaper Offensive) and decided that membership of the association journal Socialist would be incompatible with membership in SSU. In 1997, at the Congress in Gothenburg, the conflict escalated. Two distinct factions emerged and voting for a Board became intense. The Election Committee could not find a compromise and left-wing vice-chairman Anders Ygeman was forced to leave the Board when the post was abolished. At Congress in 1999 in V√§ster√•s, a left-wing candidate, Luciano Astudillo, from SSU district Sk√•ne, almost became president. Differences between factions and a loaded Congress defeated Astudillo, and Mikael Damberg from Stockholm County SSU-district, won with votes 126-124. The European Union (EU) and European Monetary Union (EMU) were important issues. SSU decided, at an extraordinary congress in 1994, to campaign against Swedish EU membership, but did not run any campaign for a referendum the same year. The union gradually became more positive toward the EU and in 2001 the Congress almost considered approving Swedish EMU membership. For several years, Lisa Pellinge was Secretary-General of the IUSY.  2000s  2000 was SSU hosted the International Union of Socialist Youth's World camp in Malm√∂ with approximately 2000 participants. The camp was the largest IUSY had organized to that date. At the 2001 Congress in Portsmouth, Damberg was re-elected, as no other candidate stood. This was a very clear signal against right-wing governance and showed the conflict seriously. What the left-wing most criticized was that programs replaced the 'democratic socialism' with 'social democracy' which was thought an ideological formulation when it seemed clear that SSU was socialist. The right-wing had a large majority in Congress and had a two-thirds majority on the Board. The EMU was again an emotive issue. SU in 2002 launched its website. On 21 January 2002, party member Fadime Sahindal was murdered by her father in an honor killing. She campaigned for equality and for the rights of young women with foreign backgrounds. In 2003, SSU began a memorial fund in her memory. In 2003, the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth Congress was held in the Bommersvik. SSU won a battle against French President Youth. Anders Lindberg was elected as the first Swedish president of the Young Socialists. At the 2003 Congress in Karlstad, right-wing presidential candidate was Ardalan Shekarabi (SSU Uppland) and left-wing candidate Lina Afvander (SSU J√∂nk√∂ping). Afvander withdrew just before the president election on the morning on August 6 when she became the Nomination Committee's proposal, and Shekarabi was elected unanimously. Sara Heelge-Vikm√•ng (SSU √ñsterg√∂tland) was elected Secretary-General. Congress also decided, about one month before the referendum, to offer no opinion on the Swedish introduction of the Euro. In media, it has been claimed that the choice of Shekarabi may have been surrounded by some irregularities, which created some problems for the federation. It was alleged that money from the Development Activities was used to finance Shekarabis's internal election campaign. This may have been one of the factors contributing to the factions seeking more consensus before Congress in 2005. Shekarabis's writings led to the resignation of Congress in 2005 and the establishment of a future commission that recommended the Congress to share power between the right and left wings. 2004 Anna Sj√∂din was elected Vice-President of the International Union of Socialist Youth in Budapest. In 2004, the party campaigned to ban the fees for school food. 2005 revealed serious errors in SSU's members register. A large number of people were in the register without having paid a membership fee. The police launched an investigation when they suspected benefit fraud because SSU received financial assistance based on its membership. Records were updated and to Congress, the Federal proposed that central members should exercise better control, so that districts could not systematic cheating. The police closed the investigation for benefit fraud because the crime could not be proved and SSU free from all. Also at the 2005 Congress, the Board tried to achieve organizational unity by allowing the two factions to share the board equally. The federal leadership was divided up so that the right-wing got the chair Anna Sj√∂din and left-wing union secretarial post Mattias Veps√§. In 2006, Anna Sj√∂din was re-elected Vice-President of the International Union of Socialist Youth Congress in Esbjerg. In December 2006, Sj√∂din resigned from the presidency after being sentenced for insult, violence against officials, violent resistance and an arbitrary act. She also was sentenced to pay 5,500 Swedish krona in damages. The post of president remained vacant until the next Congress. Secretary Mattias Veps√§ was task to be SSU's spokesperson in the meantime to Congress 2007. In January 2007 the Board's new membership figures were announced; it had changed from 20,500 to 4,300. Measures were introduced to prevent cheating, which led to the fall in membership by over two thirds over one and a half years, and SSU was no longer the country's largest political youth league. In May 2007, it published the candidates to Congress in August. Mattias Veps√§ was the only candidate for a federal secretary. Jytte Guteland from the Stockholm County SSU-district and considered right-wing was nominated for the office of Federal. Several right-district support, however, Laila Naraghi from SSU Kalmar L√§n. There was discontent in parts of the right- wing because the Stockholm County SSU-district and Jytte Guteland's other support district had handled the Inter-democracy poorly. In the spring, it was decided to hold a divided caucus to advocate Jytte Guteland to the Federal SSU. On August 8, at the Congress, Guteland was elected as chairman with 131 votes against 115 for Laila Naraghi. In the last counting, SSU had 8 000 members all over Sweden, making it by far the second largest political youth league. It had gained 2 500 new members, whilst MUF only gained 1 500 members.  2010s  Gabriel Wikstr√∂m was elected president in 2011. In October 2014 he became the first serving president of SSU to become appointed a cabinet minister when he got the position of Minister for Public Health, Healthcare and Sports in the L√∂fven cabinet. Ellinor Eriksson, who served as secretary general, then became acting president of SSU. In August 2015 SSU held its 38th national congress in V√§ster√•s. The congress elected Philip Botstr√∂m as the new president of SSU and Andrea T√∂rnestam as secretary general. The new leadership is elected on a two-year mandate, with a chance to be reelected.

Crevalle was launched 22 February 1943 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Fisher; and commissioned 24 June 1943, Lieutenant Commander Henry G. Munson in command.  First and second war patrols, October 1943 ‚Äì February 1944  Crevalle arrived at Brisbane, Australia, from New London 11 October 1943, and after replenishing there and at Darwin, put to sea 27 October on her first war patrol, in the Sulu and South China Seas. On 15 November she sank the passenger-cargo ship Kyokko Maru, almost 7,000 tons. On Thursday 18 November 1943, off the entrance to Manila Bay, Crevalle torpedoed and damaged the , incorrectly reporting Akitsu Maru as sunk. Crevalle made two more attacks on merchant ships before returning to Fremantle, Australia, for refit 7 December. Her second war patrol, in the South China Sea from 30 December 1943 to 15 February 1944, found her attacking a submerged Japanese submarine on 7 January, only to know the frustration of premature torpedo explosion. In a hazardous special mission, she laid mines off Saigon on 14 and 15 January, and on 26 January sent a Japanese freighter to the bottom. A surface action with a small patrol boat on 11 February sank the enemy craft, and on 15 February, Crevalle fired at several targets in a large convoy, prudently clearing the area before the results of her firing could be verified.  Third and fourth war patrols, April ‚Äì August 1944  On 16 March 1944 while refitting at Fremantle, Commander F. D. Walker assumed command, and on 4 April, Crevalle sailed for the South China Sea. She sank a freighter 25 April, and the oiler, Nisshin Maru(16,801 tons) 6 May, and on 11 May surfaced off Negros Island in the Philippines on another daring special mission. She rescued 40 refugees here, including 28 women and children, and 4 men who had survived the Bataan Death March and made their escape. She also took off the family of an American missionary, who having seen his family to safety, returned ashore at the last minute to continue his ministry among the guerrillas. Along with her passengers, Crevalle recovered a group of important documents (the Japanese \\"Z plan\\"), and transferred all she could spare in the way of supplies to the guerrillas. In May 1944, while returning with her passengers to Darwin, Crevalle was spotted by a Japanese convoy on the third day of the journey. With four working torpedoes Capt. Walker maneuvered to attack, but was severely depth-charged by a Japanese bomber, a special ordeal for the passengers. The periscopes and radar were knocked out. They were landed safely at Darwin 19 May, 8 days after leaving the Philippines. Most uniquely, one of the female passengers also gave birth to a healthy baby boy during the return trip. [Needs Citation]. Crevalle sailed on to refit at Fremantle. For her fourth war patrol, Crevalle returned to the South China Sea, as well as cruising off the northern Philippines, between 21 June and 9 August 1944. In company with three other submarines for most of this patrol, Crevalle joined in a 30-hour pursuit and attack on a convoy on 25 July and 26 July, sinking one freighter, and polishing off another already crippled by one of her groups. Two days later, Crevalle inflicted heavy damage on another freighter.  Fifth war patrol, September 1944  Refitted once more at Fremantle, Crevalle put to sea on her fifth war patrol 1 September 1944. Ten days later, she surfaced after a routine trim dive. A lookout, Bill Fritchen, was first through the hatch followed closely by the Officer of the Deck, Lt. Howard James Blind. Fifteen seconds later, the boat took a sharp down angle, and submerged with the upper and lower conning tower hatches open, washing the lookout overboard. The flow of water through the upper hatch, which was latched opened, prevented anyone in the conning tower from closing it. The lower hatch to the control was blocked by a piece of floor matting. At the hatch was seen to close and lock. The ship continued diving to at an angle that reached 42 degrees down. With communications out, an alert machinist's mate, Robert L. Yeager, saved the submarine by backing full without orders. The pump room, control room and conning tower flooded completely, and all electrical equipment was inoperative. Yeager received the Silver Star for his action. Bringing the submarine under control, her men surfaced and were able to recover the lookout, but not Lt. Blind. It was later determined that the stern planes had jammed in the full dive position causing the sudden dive. With Fritchen having been washed off the bridge when the submarine dived, it was concluded that Blind had hung on the ship, and sacrificed his life in unlatching the upper conning tower hatch, saving the submarine. Blind posthumously received the Navy Cross for his action. Blind, a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, had married a woman in Australia only two weeks before his death. Crevalle made her way back to Fremantle 22 September, and sailed on to an overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, followed by training at Pearl Harbor.  Sixth and seventh war patrol, March ‚Äì July 1945  The submarine put to sea on her sixth war patrol from Pearl Harbor 13 March 1945 under the command of Captain Everett Hartwell Steinmetz. Cruising in the East China Sea, she took up a lifeguard station during air strikes preparing for the Okinawa invasion, then on 23 April ‚Äì 25 April, made a hazardous search for a minefield believed to be located near the southern entrance to the Tsushima Straits. She returned to Guam to refit from 3 May to 27 May, then sailed for her seventh war patrol in the northeast section of the Sea of Japan under the command of Captain Everett Hartwell Steinmetz. She sank a freighter a day on 9 June, 10 June, and 11 June, and on 22 June inflicted heavy damage on an escort ship. Returning to Pearl Harbor 5 July, she got underway once more on 11 August, but received word of the end of hostilities before entering her assigned patrol area. She called at Guam and Saipan before returning to Pearl Harbor 10 September, then on 13 September, cleared for New York City, arriving 5 October. The captain of these patrols, Everett Hartwell Steinmetz, received a Navy Cross for each patrol.  Post-war service  After a repair period, Crevalle reported at New London, her assigned home port, 27 March 1946. She cruised to the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands before being placed out of commission in reserve at New London 20 July 1946. Recommissioned 6 September 1951, Crevalle took part in training, exercises, and fleet operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until 19 August 1955, when she was again placed out of commission in reserve at New London. Again recommissioned 11 April 1957, she resumed her East Coast and Caribbean operations through 1960. Crevalle was reclassified an Auxiliary Research Submarine AGSS-291 in 1960. She was decommissioned, 9 March 1962. Crevalle was struck from the Naval Register, 15 April 1968, and sold for scrap, 17 March 1971. All of Crevalle's war patrols, save the interrupted fifth, were designated as \\"successful\\", and the first four won her the Navy Unit Commendation for distinguished performance of duty as well as four battle stars. Her last two war patrols were recognized with one battle star awarded for the Okinawa operation. She is credited with having sunk a total of 51,814 tons of shipping, and shared in the credit for an additional 8,666 tons.

Political career Militant tendency McCombes first became involved in socialist politics in the 1970s, as a member of the Militant group. Together with Tommy Sheridan he played a leading role in the anti-poll tax movement. His 1988 pamphlet, How To Beat The Poll Tax, written a year before the tax was introduced, set out the strategy of a Scotland-wide united mass non-payment campaign. In 1992 McCombes was a leading figure in the persuading Militant in Scotland to break with Labour resulting in the creation of Scottish Militant Labour. Throughout the 1990s, he challenged the traditional \\"British Road to Socialism\\", arguing for the left to champion the idea of an independent Scottish socialist republic. In 1995, he called for a Scottish Socialist Alliance to unite the left. This was established six months later, laying the basis for the emergence of the SSP. In 1996, McCombes established the Scottish Socialist Voice as a new fortnightly paper of the left, which he edited until 2003. This later became the newspaper of the Scottish Socialist Party. Scottish Socialist Party McCombes held the position of policy co-ordinator for the SSP for a number of years. In this role encouraged comrades to rethink the educational approach within the party and adopt more Marxist styles of engagement, influenced in particular by Paulo Freire. He has also argued that the party should embrace more diffuse structures than the traditional models of socialist parties championing the introduction of issue-based networks in addition to the geographic branch structure. Alongside Tommy Sheridan, he co-wrote Imagine: A Socialist Vision for the 21st Century. During the bombing of Afghanistan, McCombes travelled to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to report for the Scottish Socialist Voice. McCombes co-ordinated the SSP's electoral campaign for the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, which saw the return of 6 MSPs for the party. He announced his candidacy for convenor of the SSP on 19 January 2005. At the party conference on 13 February, he won 154 votes from SSP delegates, losing by 98 to Colin Fox. He was a leading member of the ISM platform until its dissolution in 2006. Involvement in the Tommy Sheridan defamation trial As part of the Sheridan v News International defamation trial, he appeared at the Court of Session on 16 May 2006 following a demand by News International to hand over confidential internal SSP executive committee minutes. He refused On 26 May 2006 he was jailed for 12 days and his home was raided by Messengers at Arms after he refused to comply with the order to hand over the documents. He was released on 29 May after a decision by the SSP national council to hand the minutes over to the court. On 7 July 2006, McCombes gave evidence in the defamation proceedings launched by Tommy Sheridan against the News of the World stating that Sheridan had admitted to him that he had visited swingers clubs. His version of events was supported by ten other people who were present at the meeting and matched the minutes of the meeting presented in court, though these were disputed during the court case. He declared himself a hostile witness, describing the case as a \\"squalid little squabble\\" but was ordered to answer questions by the judge. He said: \\"I am here under the strongest possible protest. [...] Your client, I have to say, the News of the World, symbolises everything that as a socialist I have stood against my whole adult life. [...] It should have been settled by one of both parties before innocent people were dragged into this bizarre pantomime.\\" In August 2006, in the aftermath of the Sheridan defamation case, McCombes publicly released an all-members bulletin addressed to members of the SSP, entitled \\"The Fight for the Truth\\" in which he said Tommy Sheridan's libel victory over the News of the World \\"could set back the cause of socialism by years if not decades\\" because of the divisions that had occurred within the party and went on to give his view of the events leading up to the trial. He also condemned Tommy Sheridan's announcement to stand for election as convenor of the SSP and said that Tommy Sheridan's support had been \\"based on the more middle class and rural sections of the party\\" and were \\"united only by their hostility to the majority of the leadership\\".http://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/pdfs/Bulletinsummer06pdf.pdf In 2010 he was also a witness in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan. During the trial it emerged that he was the author of an affidavit to the Sunday Herald which detailed that the party had asked Sheridan to resign as convenor, citing \\"certain information\\" in the party's possession. Contrary to prior speculation it emerged that the affidavit did not contain details of the party's 9 November executive meeting. In June 2011, he published Downfall, his account of the Sheridan affair. Environmental activity In the 2010s, McCombs moved to Perthshire to work for the John Muir Trust which works to defend wild land, enhance habitats and encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to connect with wild places. In 2014, he and Roz Paterson published Restless Land: A Radical Journey Through Scotland's History.

It stars Brigitte Bardot, Michel Piccoli, Jack Palance, and Giorgia Moll. Plot Paul Javal, a young French playwright who has found commercial success in Rome, accepts an offer from vulgar American producer Jeremy Prokosch to rework the script for German director Fritz Lang's screen adaptation of the Odyssey. Paul's wife, Camille Javal, joins him on the first day of the project at Cinecitt√†. As the first discussions are completed, Prokosch invites the crew to join him at his villa, offering Camille a ride in his two-seat sportscar. Camille looks to Paul to decline the offer, but he submissively withdraws to follow by taxi, leaving Camille and Prokosch alone. Paul does not catch up with them until 30 minutes later, explaining that he was delayed by a traffic accident. Camille grows uneasy, secretly doubting his honesty and suspecting that he is using her to cement his ties with Prokosch. Her misgivings are heightened when she sees Paul grope Prokosch's secretary, Francesca. Back at their apartment, Paul and Camille discuss the subtle uneasiness that has come between them in the first few hours of the project, and Camille suddenly announces to her bewildered husband that she no longer loves him. Hoping to rekindle Camille's love, Paul convinces her to accept Prokosch's invitation to join them for filming in Capri. Prokosch and Lang are locked in a conflict over the correct interpretation of Homer's work, an impasse exacerbated by the difficulty of communication between the German director, French script writer, and American producer. Francesca acts as interpreter, mediating all conversations. When Paul sides with Prokosch against Lang by suggesting that Odysseus actually left home because of his wife's infidelity, Camille's suspicions of her husband's servility are confirmed. She deliberately allows him to find her in Prokosch's embrace, and in the ensuing confrontation she declares that her respect for him has turned to contempt because he has bartered her to Prokosch. He denies this accusation, offering to sever his connection with the film and leave Capri; but she will not recant and leaves for Rome with the producer. After an auto crash in which Camille and Prokosch are killed, Paul prepares to leave Capri and return to the theater. Lang continues to work on the film. Cast * Brigitte Bardot as Camille Javal * Michel Piccoli as Paul Javal * Jack Palance as Jeremy Prokosch * Giorgia Moll as Francesca Vanini * Fritz Lang as himself * Raoul Coutard as the cameraman * Jean-Luc Godard as Lang's assistant director * Linda Veras as a Siren Production Italian film producer Carlo Ponti approached Godard to discuss a possible collaboration; Godard suggested an adaptation of Moravia's novel Il disprezzo (originally translated into English with the title A Ghost at Noon) in which he saw Kim Novak and Frank Sinatra as the leads; they refused. Ponti suggested Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, whom Godard refused. Anna Karina (by then Godard's former wife) later revealed that the director had traveled to Rome to ask Monica Vitti if she would portray the female lead. However the Italian actress reportedly turned up an hour late, \\"staring out the window like she wasn't interested at all\\". Finally, Bardot was chosen because of the producer's insistence that the profits might be increased by displaying her famously sensual body. This provided the film's opening scene, filmed by Godard as a typical mockery of the cinema business with tame nudity. The scene was shot after Godard considered the film finished, at the insistence of the American co-producers. In the film, Godard cast himself as Lang's assistant director, and characteristically has Lang expound many of Godard's New Wave theories and opinions. Godard also employed the two \\"forgotten\\" New Wave filmmakers, Luc Moullet and Jacques Rozier, on the film. Bardot visibly reads a book about Fritz Lang that was written by Moullet, and Rozier made the documentary short about the making of the film Le Parti des Choses. Godard admitted to changing the original novel, \\"but with full permission\\" of Moravia, the original writer. Among his changes were focusing the action to only a few days and changing the writer character from being \\"silly and soft. I've made him more American‚Äîsomething like a Humphrey Bogart type.\\" Filming Contempt was filmed in Italy where it is set, with location shooting at the Cinecitt√† studios in Rome and the Casa Malaparte on Capri island. In a sequence, the characters played by Piccoli and Bardot wander through their apartment alternately arguing and reconciling. Godard filmed the scene as an extended series of tracking shots, in natural light and in near real-time. The cinematographer Raoul Coutard shot some of the other nouvelle vague films, including Godard's Breathless (1960). According to Jonathan Rosenbaum, Godard was also directly influenced by Jean-Daniel Pollet and Volker Schl√∂ndorff's M√©diterran√©e, released earlier the same year. Godard admitted his tendency to get actors to improvise dialogue \\"during the peak moment of creation\\" often baffled them. \\"They often feel useless,\\" he said. \\"Yet they bring me a lot... I need them, just as I need the pulse and colours of real settings for atmosphere and creation.\\" Critical reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 56 reviews, with an average score of 8.61/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"This powerful work of essential cinema joins 'meta' with 'physique,' casting Brigitte Bardot and director Godard's inspiration Fritz Lang.\\" Sight & Sound critic Colin MacCabe referred to Contempt as \\"the greatest work of art produced in postwar Europe.\\"Phillip Lopate \\"Brilliance And Bardot, All in One\\" The New York Times (22 June 1997) Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"luxuriant\\" but wrote that Godard \\"could put his talents to more intelligent and illuminating use\\"; according to Crowther, who is unclear about the motivations of the main characters, \\"Mr. Godard has attempted to make this film communicate a sense of the alienation of individuals in this complex modern world. And he has clearly directed to get a tempo that suggests irritation and ennui.\\"The New York Times movie review by Bosley Crowther from December 19, 1964 Legacy Antoine de Gaudemar made a one-hour documentary in 2009 about Contempt, Il √©tait une fois... Le M√©pris (A Film and Its Era: Contempt) which incorporated footage from Jacques Rozier's earlier documentaries Paparazzi (1963), Le Parti des Choses (1964), and Andr√© S. Labarthe's Le dinosaure et le b√©b√© (1967). The extended apartment sequence that occurs in the film, where Paul and Camille's marriage unfolds, has been praised by critics and scholars. In February 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights how Jean-Luc Godard uses this constricted space to explore Paul and Camille's declining relationship.Mehruss Jon Ahi and Armen Karaoghlanian \\"Le m√©pris\\". Interiors Journal (15 February 2012). The song \\"Theme de Camille\\", which was originally composed for Contempt, is used as a main theme in the 1995 film Casino.

In 2009, it changed from a broadsheet to a tabloid format. It is primarily distributed through subscription and street sales. The aims of the Voice, as set out in its first issue, are: * To report the struggles of ordinary people against injustice, discrimination and exploitation. * To expose corruption and hypocrisy in high places. * To cover politics, culture and sport from a socialist standpoint. * To champion the cause of an independent socialist Scotland as part of a worldwide fightback against global capitalism. In December 2004, the Voice celebrated its 200th issue. In November 2006, it celebrated its tenth anniversary. Forum events Since at least 2013, the Voice has hosted a number of cross-party discussion events called \\"Forums\\". In December 2013, figures from the pro-independence left were invited to a Forum to discuss Scotland's Future, which was chaired by John Finnie and featured Jim Sillars, John McAllion, Isobel Lindsay, Prof Mike Danson, Maggie Chapman, and Colin Fox on its panel.

It is also currently used by the Royal Jordanian Army as its main battle tank, after heavy modifications. The variants for the Jordanian military are to be upgraded using the unmanned Falcon turret. History Challenger 1 of the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards with IFOR markings. Challenger 1 of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards near Kuwait City during the Gulf War. The Challenger design by the former Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE) near Chobham in Surrey originated in an Iranian order for an improved version of the Chieftain line of tanks in service around the world. These were the Chieftain Mk5(P)- FV4030/1, FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1 and 4030/3 Shir 2. With the fall of the Shah of Iran and the collapse of the UK MBT-80 project, the British Army became the customer and the tank was further developed by MVEE to meet Western European requirements. For a short time the tank was named \\"Cheviot\\" (the name of a hill range) before becoming \\"Challenger\\", a name reused from the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank of World War II. The most advanced aspect of the Challenger 1 design was its Chobham armour, which gave protection far superior to any monolithic Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA), then standard of western tank armour material. This armour was later adopted by other designs, including the American M1 Abrams. Additionally, the hydropneumatic suspension provided outstanding cross-country performance through the long suspension arm travel and controlled bump and rebound behaviour offered. The Challenger was built by the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROF). Challenger 1 entered service with the British Army in 1983 and production ceased in 1990 at a cost of around ¬£2 million each.Classic Military Vehicle Magazine, Issue 46, March 2005 In 1986, ROF Leeds (and the Challenger production line) was acquired by Vickers Defence Systems (later Alvis Vickers). Jordan initially purchased 274 Challenger 1 tanks. Under an agreement signed in March 1999, another 288 surplus Challenger 1s were supplied to Jordan over a three-year period, which enabled the Jordanian Centurion fleet (known locally as Tariq) to be replaced. The Ministry of Defence was keen to show off the capabilities of the Challenger 1 in the Canadian Army Trophy Competition (CAT '87), held at Grafenw√∂hr, West Germany, in June 1987. The best performing team in preparatory competitions had been the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, although its Challengers had not been fitted with Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight (TOGS), which would put them at a disadvantage. The Royal Hussars had a squadron fitted with TOGS; however, they had been training at BATUS in Canada with Chieftains, instead of training with Challenger and TOGS for CAT '87. Twenty-two new Challengers with TOGS were specially diverted from the production line for the competition, resulting in teething problems. At the competition itself, the Hussars managed some creditable scores but overall, their three \\"platoons\\" were placed last in the league table. In a statement to the House of Commons on 14 July, Ian Stewart, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, said; \\"I do not believe that the performance of tanks in the artificial circumstances of a competition, such as the recent Canadian Army Trophy, is a proper indication of their capability in war.\\" Following poor results in 1985 with Chieftain, and in 1987 with Challenger, the British Army decided in December 1987 to withdraw indefinitely from the competition.Jane's Defence Weekly: Volume 12, Jane's Publishing Company, 1989 (p.7) A requirement for a new MBT was later issued. Proposals put forward for the new specification included an improved Challenger from Vickers, the American M1 Abrams, the French Leclerc, and the German Leopard 2. The Vickers Defence Systems design, designated Challenger 2, was eventually selected. This tank is significantly more capable than its predecessor: based on the same basic MVEE-designed hull, it features a new turret based on the Vickers Private Venture Mk7 design and improved Chobham armour. Withdrawals of British Army Challenger 1 began in 1998 and it had been completely replaced by Challenger 2 by 2001. There was also a Challenger Marksman SPAAG version, equipped with the Marksman turret. Operational service A Challenger 1 tank during the Gulf War 221 Challenger tanks were deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Granby, the UK operation in the 1991 Gulf War. In the original deployment, the 7th Armoured Brigade included two armoured regiments, the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, both equipped with 57 of the latest Mark 3 version of the Challenger 1. They were modified for desert operations by a REME team and civilian contractors at the quayside in Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia. This fit included additional Chobham Armour along the hull sides and explosive reactive armour (ERA) on the nose and front glacis plate. Modifications also included the provision of extra external fuel drums and a smoke generator. There were major concerns about the reliability of the vehicle.McManners p36 In addition there were serious worries about how a tank designed to perform in temperate climates would stand the rigours of desert warfare. Before the commencement of the Gulf War deployment only 22% of Challenger 1s were operational because of faults and lack of spares.McManners p18 On 22 November 1990, it was decided to add the 4th Armoured Brigade to the force, under the umbrella of 1st (UK) Armoured Division. The new brigade had a single Challenger regiment, 14th/20th King's Hussars, equipped with 43 Challenger 1 tanks and reinforced by a squadron of the Life Guards. They were equipped with the Mark 2 version of the tank, which was upgraded by armouring the storage bins for the 120 mm charges as well as the additional armour fitted to the Mark 3's. During Operation Desert Shield it was decided that the 1st (UK) Armoured Division would be placed under the command of the US VII Corps. This corps would form the armoured fist of the Coalition forces, tasked with destroying the bulk of the Iraqi forces. The forces of VII corps crossed the Saudi border into Iraq, and then crossed into Kuwait. The 1st (UK) Armoured Division was the easternmost unit in VII Corp's sector, its Challenger tanks forming the spearhead of the advance. The division advanced nearly 350 km within 97 hours, destroying the Iraqi 46th Mechanised Brigade, 52nd Armoured Brigade and elements of at least three infantry divisions belonging to the Iraqi 7th corps in a series of battles and engagements. They captured or destroyed about 120 tanks and a very large number of armoured personnel carriers, trucks, reconnaissance vehicles, etc. The main threat to the Challenger was deemed to be the Iraqi Republican Guard's T-72M tanks; each British tank was provided with twelve L26A1 \\"Jericho\\" depleted uranium (DU) shells specifically for use against T-72Ms, but during the course of the Coalition's ground campaign none was encountered as the division was withdrawn beforehand.Dunstan (pp.37-39) In action, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Thermal Observation and Gunnery System (TOGS) fitted to the Challengers proved to be decisive, allowing attacks to be made at night, in poor visibility and through smoke screens.Dunstan (p.39) In total, British Challengers destroyed roughly 300 Iraqi tanks without suffering a single loss in combat. Patrick Cordingley, the commander of 7th Armoured Brigade, said afterwards that \\"Challenger is a tank built for combat and not competitions.\\"GlobalSecurity.org On 26 February 1991, a Challenger achieved the longest range confirmed kill of the war, destroying an Iraqi tank with an armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) round fired over a distance of ‚Äîthe longest tank-on-tank kill shot recorded.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYzaxW6zh3U&t;=120s Challengers were also used by the British Army in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operation Joint Guardian, the NATO-led drive into Kosovo.

They can be divided into 45‚Äì50 genera and were sometimes treated as a separate family Heliconiidae within the Papilionoidea. The colouration is predominantly reddish and black, and though of varying wing shape, the forewings are always elongated tipwards, hence the common name. Most longwings are found in the Tropics, particularly in South America; only the Argynnini are quite diverse in the Holarctic. Especially tropical species feed on poisonous plants, characteristically Passifloraceae vines, as larvae, becoming poisonous themselves. The adult butterflies announce their acquired toxicity with strong aposematic colours, warning off would-be predators. There are several famous cases of Batesian and M√ºllerian mimicry both within this group and with other butterflies. Other commonly seen food plants are Fabaceae (which also contain several toxic species), and particularly among northerly species of Violaceae.Silva-Brand√£o et al. (2008) Systematics Four or five tribes are generally recognized in the Heliconiinae. There have been numerous attempts to sort out the phylogenetic sequence and delimitation of these, but while the former has made good progress, the latter has hitherto only achieved limited results. Several phylogenies (and corresponding taxonomic adjustments) have been proposed, but though looking reasonable each and every one of them is only weakly supported. Even cladistic analyses of the same type of data often yield contradicting results depending on the exact method of evaluation. Ultimately, the reason is that just a fraction of the evolutionary diversity of Heliconiinae has been sampled. What appears fairly certain is that the Argynnini and Vagrantini are closer relatives than any other two tribes of Heliconiinae. The Acraeini and Heliconiini are probably more basal lineages, but the exact placement of each respective to the other tribes cannot be considered well resolved at all. Male of the silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), type species of Argynnis and the Argynnini Some tribes are distributed among several continents, resulting in a confusing phylogeography pattern. But as it seems, the apparent contradictions between systematics and biogeography are due to the premature classifications based on insufficient taxon sampling. With studies becoming more and more comprehensive, the apparent anomalies seem to sort themselves out at least for the most part. For example, the confusing distribution pattern of Acraea in the wide circumscription is apparently simply due to the bulk of this morphologically conservative group warranting recognition as genus Telchinia - it stands to note that this group has on occasion been allied with Actinote rather than Acraea, and this indeed appears to be correct. In addition, the genus Pardopsis, often placed in the Acraeini, does almost certainly not belong there; it is now tentatively placed in the Argynnini. The relationships of the genus Cethosia (sometimes treated as a tribe of its own) are even more mysterious, and it is likely that some other genera will eventually also be moved to a different tribe as they are studied in detail. Some, like the Argynnini Argynnis, Boloria and Issoria, might be overlumped and non-monophyletic and thus some genera presently usually considered junior synonyms of them might eventually be validated like Telchinia. Genera Well-known tawny coaster of the Acraeini presently goes by the scientific name Acraea terpsicore. Genera are presented in the presumed phylogenetic sequence. Notable species are also given if no genus article exists.Based on Wahlberg [2008], Silva-Brand√£o et al. (2008). See also Savela (2008) for further sources.

The female form is Edle. von M√ºnzberg (2 June 1863 - 7 May 1942) was an Austrian conductor, composer and pianist. Life and career Weingartner was born in Zara, Dalmatia, Austria‚ÄìHungary (now Zadar, Croatia), to Austrian parents. The family moved to Graz in 1868, and his father died later that year. He studied with Wilhelm Mayer (who published his own compositions under the pseudonym of W. A. R√©my and also taught Ferruccio Busoni). In 1881 he went to Leipzig to study philosophy, but soon devoted himself entirely to music, entering the Conservatory in 1883 and studying in Weimar as one of Franz Liszt's last pupils. Liszt helped produce the world premiere of Weingartner's opera Sakuntala in 1884 with the Weimar orchestra. According to Liszt biographer Alan Walker, however, the Weimar orchestra of the 1880s was far from its peak of a few decades earlier and the performance ended up poorly, with the orchestra going one way and the chorus another. Walker got this account from Weingartner's autobiography, published in Z√ºrich and Leipzig in 1928‚Äì1929. The same year, 1884, he assumed the directorship of the K√∂nigsberg Opera. From 1885 to 1887 he was Kapellmeister in Danzig, then in Hamburg until 1889, and in Mannheim until 1891. Starting that year, he was Kapellmeister of the Royal Opera and conductor of symphony concerts in Berlin. He eventually resigned from the opera post while continuing to conduct the symphony concerts, and then settled in Munich, where he incurred the enmity of pundits like Rudolf Louis and Ludwig Thuille. In 1902, at the Mainz Festival, Weingartner conducted all nine Beethoven symphonies. From 1907 to 1910 he was the Director of the Vienna Hofoper, succeeding Gustav Mahler; he retained the conductorship of the Vienna Philharmonic until 1927. From 1912 he was again Kapellmeister in Hamburg, but resigned in 1914 and went to Darmstadt as general music director while also often conducting in the U.S. for the Boston Opera Company between 1912‚Äì1914. In 1919‚Äì20, he was chief conductor of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1920, he became a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest. From 1927 to 1934 he was music director of the Basel symphony orchestra. He made many outstanding Beethoven and Brahms symphony recordings in Vienna and London between the mid-1920s and his last recording session with the London Symphony, including an electrifying Brahms Second to complete the historic Beethoven-Brahms symphony cycle he began in the 1920s (see below), on February 29, 1940. He gave his last concert in London that year and died in Winterthur, Switzerland two years later. Weingartner was the first conductor to make commercial recordings of all nine Beethoven symphonies, and the second (to Leopold Stokowski in Philadelphia) to record all four Brahms symphonies. In 1935 he conducted the world premiere of Georges Bizet's long-lost Symphony in C. His crisp classical conducting style contrasted with the romantic approach of many of his contemporaries such as Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, whose conducting is now considered \\"subjective\\" on the basis of tempo fluctuations not called for in the printed scores; while Weingartner was more like Arturo Toscanini in insisting on playing as written. His 1935 recording of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, for instance, sounds much more like Toscanini's 1936, 1938, 1939 and 1952 renditions (only the last of which was recorded in a studio rather than at a concert) than Furtw√§ngler's far more expansive readings. He taught conducting to students as eminent as Paul Sacher, Charles Houdret, Georg Tintner and Josef Krips. He experimented with films of himself conducting (such as in his only recorded performance of Weber's overture to Der Freisch√ºtz) as a tool in \\"orchestral training\\". He was married five times, to Marie Juillerat (in 1891), Baroness Feodora von Dreifus (1903), mezzo- soprano Lucille Marcel (1912; died in 1921), actress Roxo Betty Kalisch (1922), and Carmen Studer (1931). Composer and editor Despite his lifelong career as a conductor, Weingartner regarded himself as equally, if not more importantly, a composer. Besides numerous operas, Weingartner wrote seven symphonies which have all been recorded, with his other orchestral music, by cpo - classic production osnabr√ºck, in Osnabr√ºck, Germany. A sinfonietta, violin concerto, cello concerto, orchestral works, at least five string quartets, quintets for strings and for piano with clarinet and other pieces including a great many Lieder for voice and piano, one of which, \\"Liebesfeier\\" (text: Lenau) achieved a status as his most famous short work, in effect a \\"hit\\". Weingartner's choice of verse for his songs mirrors that of his contemporary composers: Max Reger, Joseph Marx, Richard Trunk and Richard Strauss. His musical style, notably very generous, indeed rather valuable in its rather Schubertian melodic interest, is of its time: an amalgam of late Romanticism and early Modernism, comparable with those of his contemporaries Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Franz Schreker and Alexander Zemlinsky. His idiom left some marks on Erich Wolfgang Korngold, whose precocious Sinfonietta is dedicated to Weingartner, who conducted its first performance. His Third Symphony was intended both as a message of love to Lucille Marcel and a reply to the many critical attacks on him in Vienna; the finale reaches a climax in a parody of the waltz from Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus. Similarly, he managed to finish his Fifth Symphony in time for Roxo Betty's birthday, a trend in romantic attachment which may attract at least passing notice, for he was thus a very dedicated bridegroom in his deployment of manuscript paper. Weingartner edited, with Charles Malherbe, the complete works of Hector Berlioz (he once called Berlioz the \\"creator of the modern orchestra\\") as well as the operas Joseph by M√©hul and Oberon by Weber, and individual works of Gluck, Wagner and others. He also made orchestral versions of piano works such as Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata, Weber's Invitation to the Dance, and Bizet's Variations chromatiques. Before Brian Newbould's more recent work, in 1934, he made a performing version of Schubert's Symphony No. 7 in E major, D. 729, that has received some performances and recordings; he also arranged works by a number of early Romantic masters for orchestral performance. Writings and interests Weingartner was early interested in the occult, astrology, and Eastern mysticism, which influenced his personal philosophy and his music to some extent. He was himself a prolific writer who published a poetical drama, Golgotha, in 1908. He wrote copiously on music drama, on conducting, on the symphony since Beethoven, on the symphonies of Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann as well as on art and esoteric subjects. Two collections of essays were Musikalische Walpurgisnacht (1907) and Akkorde (1912). He also published an autobiography, Lebenserinnerungen in 1923.

Khojki, or Khojiki (; (Arabic script) ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§ú‡§ï‡•Ä (Devanagari)), is a script used formerly and almost exclusively by the Khoja community of parts of the Indian subcontinent such as Sindh. The name \\"Khojki\\" is derived from the Persian word khoje, which means \\"master\\", or \\"lord\\". It was employed primarily to record Isma'ili religious literature as well as literature for a few secret Twelver sects. It is one of the two Landa scripts used for liturgy, the other being the Gurmukhƒ´ alphabet, which is associated with Sikhism. History The (Nizari Ismaili) tradition states that Khojki was created by Pir Sadardin (da‚Äòi Pir Sadruddin). He was sent by the Ismaili Imam of the time to spread the Ismaili Muslim faith in the Indian subcontinent. He did this by singing and teaching Ismaili Muslim Ginans (literally translates to \\"knowledge\\", a word for devotional and religious literature). He then wrote them down in Khojki. Khojki is a Brahmi-based script of the Sindhi branch of the Landa family, which is a class of mercantile scripts related to Sharada. It is considered to be a refined version of the LohƒÅnƒÅkƒ´ script (Khudabadi script) that was developed as a liturgical script for recording Ismaili literature. Popular Nizari Ismaili tradition states that Khojki was invented and propagated by Pir Sadruddin (·π¢adr al-Dƒ´n), an Ismaili missionary actively working with the LohƒÅnƒÅkƒ´ community. Khojki is one of two Landa scripts that were developed into formal liturgical scripts for use by religious communities; the other is Gurmukhi, which was developed for writing the sacred literature of the Sikh tradition. Khojki is also called ‚ÄòSindhi‚Äô and ‚ÄòKhwajah Sindhi‚Äô. The script had been used from the early 16th century through the early 20th century, and it continues to be taught and used by Ismaili communities in India, Pakistan, and diaspora (esp. in East Africa). The script was typeset in 1903 by Laljibhai Devraj at his Khoja Sindhi Printing Press in Bombay. Some script reforms occurred in the 1930s to mirror phonological changes occurring in the language used. Characters Traditionally, diphthong vowels were written as a combination of vowel forms, and there were multiple forms of writing some of them. This is also true of the virama. There are also contextual variants of consonant-vowel combinations for some vowels, as is found in the Modi script. For conjuncts, there are a few 'inherent' conjuncts found in most Indic scripts, such as ksa, jna, and tra, and dra is also found in addition. Most consonants are written using the virama pattern, as is found in the Saurashtra script or in the Tamil script, but some are written with a reduced consonant form on the second consonant in the cluster, typically with ra and ya. Gemination is indicated with the Arabic shadda, while nasalization is indicated with an anusvara that is reminiscent of Devanagari in position but of Telugu, Kannada, or Malayalam in shape. The nukta is composed of three dots, similar to the three dots found in modifying historically Arabic letters in the Persian script, and it is added to certain letters to form Arabic sounds. They can sometimes be ambiguous, with the nukta over the same letter sometimes mapping to multiple Arabic letters, as in ja or as in sa. Punctuation exists for marking word boundaries using colon-like marks, section boundaries using a combination of colon-like marks and double danda-like marks, and other Latin punctuation is also present. Abbreviation marks are represented by a small circle to the side, as is found in Modi and in Goykanadi. Verse numbering is indicated by an overline and digits and number forms typically use those found throughout North India in the region. Some additional letters and forms have been found, are detailed in the Unicode Proposal, and are being researched. Over time some of the characters represented different sounds, which makes it difficult to read certain texts with the historical phonological values as compared to those with the modern phonological values known to most modern readers of published Ismaili literature. This is particularly true of the implosives, aspirants, and normal forms of ba, da, and ja, which shifted to render the implosive letter as a normal letter phonologically, the normal letter as an aspirant letter phonologically, and rendered the aspirant letter unnecessary. The implosive for ja began to represent za. Unicode Khojki script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

He was also count of Carcassonne from 837. He was appointed to succeed his fellow Frank Rampon. During his career, he was one of the closest counsellors of the Emperor Louis the Pious, a leading proponent of the war against the Moors, and opponent of the interests of the local Visigothic nobility. Title Bernard was indisputably a count (comes) of Barcelona and several other counties over the course of his long career. He also appears in the chronicles with the title duke (dux), though the extent to which this was a military designation is obscure.Archibald R. Lewis, \\"The Dukes in the Regnum Francorum, A.D. 550‚Äì751\\" Speculum 51.3 (July 1976), pp. 381‚Äì410 offers some disambiguation of these Frankish titles. He is sometimes retrospectively referred to by historians as a margrave (marchio). Here are his name and title as they appear in several primary sources: *Bernhardus comes BarcinonensisAnnales Fuldenses (Gesta quorundam regum Francorum) s.a. AD 829 (entry ascribed to Einhard), p. 360. (\\"Bernard, Count of Barcelona\\") *duce BernhardoThegan, p 597. (\\"Duke Bernard\\") *pr√¶fatus BernardusAnnales Bertiniani.

(\\"Bernard, Duke of Barcelona\\") *Bernardus comes marc√¶ Hispanic√¶ (\\"Bernard, Count of the Hispanic March\\") *Bernardo comiti TolosanoFlodoard, p. 338. (\\"Bernard, Count of Toulouse\\") Count of Barcelona Bernard is first attested in historical records as one of four sons in a document of his father's dating to 14 December 804 dealing with the foundation of the monastery of Gellone.Thomassy, p. 179. There are two extant versions of this charter and one is dated to 15 December and does not mention Bernard. Bernard must have inherited land in the area around Toulouse from which he expanded his power to become count around 826. He first attracted the attention of higher-ups by quelling the local revolt of a nobleman named Aisso, who was perhaps a Visigothic lieutenant of the deposed Bera, Count of Barcelona.Others hypothesise that the name \\"Aisso\\" is a corruption of the Arabic Aysun, which was the name of the son of Sulayman al-Arabi, formerly imprisoned in Aachen, but who had escaped from captivity to the Hispanic March and established himself in the region of Vic. The garrisons of the castles in the area, who had been favorable to Bera, joined Aisso in a revolt against the new count. Only the castle of Roda de Ter, in the county of Ausona, resisted and was subsequently destroyed by Aisso. From his newly occupied territory, Aisso attacked the county of Cerdanya and the region of the Vall√®s. The young count Bernard requested and received some help from the Emperor, as well as that of some local hispani (probably Gothic noblemen). To counter these reinforcements, Aisso sent his brother to request help from Abd ar-Rahman II, Emir of C√≥rdoba, the only potential ally powerful enough to threaten the Franks. Abd ar-Rahman sent the general Ubayd Allah Abu Marwan to Zaragoza in May 827, from whence he invaded the territory of Barcelona, reaching the city itself in the summer. He besieged it and ransacked its environs, but failed to take it. When the Emperor learned of these raids, he ordered his second son, Pepin, then King of Aquitaine, and the counts Hugh of Tours and Matfrid of Orl√©ans to recruit an army against the Muslims, but recruitment was slow. By the time the army arrived, Abu Marwan had already returned to Muslim territory, taking Aisso and his followers with him (late 827). This reprieve, seen as a victory, greatly increased Bernard's prestige. Though the ravaged county of Ausona, a dependency of Barcelona, remained depopulated into the mid-ninth century, its ruin was attributed to the late arrival of Hugh and Matfrid. Both counts were dispossessed of their counties at the Assembly of Aachen in 828. At that assembly, Orl√©ans was granted to Odo and Bernard's brother Gaucelm received the fiefs of Conflent and Razes. As Leibulf of Provence had died in the spring, his vast dominions‚ÄîNarbonne, B√©ziers, Agde, Melgueil, N√Æmes, and probably Uz√®s‚Äîwere assigned to Bernard. From this wide collection of honores in Septimania, Bernard took the title \\"Duke of Septimania\\". In another assembly, at Ingelheim in June, a reprisal raid into Cordoban territory was considered, but although an army was gathered in Thionville, it did not enter the lands controlled by Bernard as the risk of Muslim raiding seemed to have declined. Court career In August 829 the Emperor sent his son Lothair to Pavia to wear the Iron Crown. Louis summoned Bernard to replace his son at court, with granting him the title of camerarius or Chamberlain and the custody of the young Charles, then just Duke of Alsace, Alemannia, and Rhaetia, but later destined to be King of West Francia. Bernard delegated the government of his counties to his brother Gaucelm, who thereupon took the title marchio or margrave. After only a few months at court, Bernard had made many enemies. Indeed, he was the prime catalyst for the revolt of Lothair the following year.Hummer, p. 161. Thegan of Trier, in his Gesta Hludowici, recorded that he was accused of having an illicit relationship with Empress, Judith of Bavaria, but considered these rumours to be lies. Nevertheless, these rumours provoked a riot in the army gathered at Rennes to fight the Bretons in April 830. His life under threat, as the three elder children of Louis supported the opposition against him, Bernard abandoned the court and, according to the Annales Bertiniani, returned to Barcelona. His brother, Eribert, who had remained at court, was banished. Bernard was deprived of the county of Autun which he had sometime before been granted. At an assembly in Nijmegen in October 830, the Emperor recovered his authority after a brief civil war with his sons. Subsequently in another assembly, at Aachen in February 831, he proceeded to divide the Empire, giving Gothia to Charles, although the division would not be effective until his death. Bernard attempted to regain favour with Judith and Charles, but they avoided renewing relations with him after his fall from grace. At the Assembly of Thionville, in October 831, Bernard spoke personally with the Emperor, but could not regain his previous position at court. In response Bernard reversed his previous loyalties and side with the Emperor's enemies. Civil war of 831-832 In November 831 Pepin of Aquitaine revolted against his father. While Berengar the Wise, Count of Toulouse, advised him against such a course of action, Bernard encouraged it. In early 832 Louis the Pious began the campaign against his rebellious son. Berengar, loyal to the Emperor, invaded Bernard's honores and took Roussillon (with Vallespir) and probably also Razes and Conflent. By 2 February, Berengar was already in Elna. Ultimately, the successive victories of the imperial forces compelled Pepin and Bernard to appear before the Emperor in October 832. Pepin was dispossessed of his kingdom and sent as prisoner to Trier, having ceded all his territories to his half-brother Charles. Bernard was accused of infidelity and dismissed from all his offices and dispossessed of all his honores in Septimania and Gothia, which were given to Berengar. His brother Gaucelm was probably also dispossessed, but for a time he remained in possession of the County of Emp√∫ries, ignoring his dismissal. Civil war of 833-834 In 833 however, Lothair revolted. Pepin, with Bernard and Gaucelm, remained loyal to Louis this time. After defeating Lothair's forces, and returning the emperor to power on 1 March 834, Bernard requested the return of his honores, citing the loss of men he had sustained for the emperor's cause. However, Berengar was still in legal possession. The Emperor hesitated over his decision, but in June 835 he summoned Bernard and Berengar to an Assembly in Cremieux, near Lyon, where he would deliver a verdict. Berengar died unexpectedly on the way and, freed of obstacles, the Emperor gave Septimania and its counties and the Toulouse to Bernard. The only territories not returned were Emp√∫ries and Roussillon, which had already been granted to Sunyer I and Alaric respectively, and Urgell and Cerdanya, which had been detached from Toulouse by the usurper Aznar I Gal√≠ndez. Sunifred, brother of Oliba I of Carcassonne, was assigned to expel him. Bernard returned to his domain, where the Goth population that had supported Bera and then Berengar, still opposed him. Ten complaints were presented against him at the Assembly of Quierzy-sur-Oise in September 838. From 841, he was often absent participating in the struggles of the Empire, and the counties were administered by their respective viscounts. Reign of Charles the Bald Bernard avoided participating in the Battle of Fontenay-en-Puisaye (25 June 841), where Charles the Bald and Louis the German defeated their brother Lothair, who retreated to the south with his army. Bernard remained outside the battle awaiting its result, upon which he sent his son William to offer homage to Charles the Bald and to promise him that his father would obtain the submission of Pepin II, the rebellious son of Pepin, who was claiming to rule Aquitaine. It seems that Bernard had no intention of keeping this last promise. During Charles the Bald's campaign in Aquitaine (842), he decided to punish Bernard, dispossessing him of the county of Toulouse in favor of Acfred (July). Bernard, however, refused to accept the decision and revolted, openly allying himself to Pepin II and expelling Acfred from Toulouse (843). Charles responded by sending the dux Guerin of Provence, who in 842 directed the campaign in Aquitaine, against Septimania. Various other events‚Äîrenewed Viking invasions and Breton raids‚Äîcompelled an end to the internal civil struggles afflicting the Empire and, in August 843, the Treaty of Verdun was signed between the three brothers: Charles, Louis, and Lothair. Septimania and Gothia were left in the hands of Charles the Bald. The county of Uz√®s, where Bernard still possessed estates, was assigned to Lothair. Furthermore, the county of Autun, which had long been lost to Bernard, and to which his son had renewed a claim, was given to Guerin. In 844 Charles the Bald returned to Aquitaine with the objective of forcing Pepin II to submit and conquering Toulouse. During the Battle of Toulouse of 844, Bernard of Septimania was captured, either by the royal forces during the assault on Toulouse or, according to French historian Pierre Andoque, the year before by Guerin in Uz√®s. Andoque maintains that in 844 he was merely brought before Charles during his campaign through Aquitaine. One way or the other, in May 844 Bernard was presented to Charles, who ordered his execution. The following month, Pepin II and Bernard's son William dealt a severe blow to Charles in the Angoumois on 14 June. Bernard's honores were given to Sunifred, who had been tasked previously with subduing Aznar in Aragon. Bernard married Dhuoda, (Dhuoda Sanchez) possible daughter of Sancho I of Gascony, (Sancho Loupez) on 29 June 824 in Aachen. By her he had two sons, the aforementioned William and another named Bernard Plantapilosa. Notes Sources *Lewis, Archibald R. The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050\\\\.

A development of the Centurion, the Chieftain introduced the supine (reclining) driver position to British design allowing a heavily sloped hull with reduced height. A new powerpack and improved transmission gave it higher speed than the Centurion despite being heavier due to major upgrades to armour protection and the armament: this allowed it to replace both the Conqueror and Centurion while performing their roles effectively. It remained in service until replaced by the Challenger 1 which shared many of the Chieftain's features. Development The Chieftain was an evolutionary development of the successful cruiser line of tanks that had emerged at the end of the Second World War. Its predecessor, the Centurion main battle tank (MBT), is widely considered to be one of the most successful of post-war MBT designs.Robert Jackson, \\"101 Great Tanks\\", Rosen Publishing Group, 2010Anthony Tucker-Jones, \\"Armoured Warfare in the Korean War\\", Casemate Publishers, 2013, p. 61.Simon Dunstan, \\"Centurion Universal Tank 1943-2003\\", Osprey Publishing, 2003, p. 3.J. H. Joiner, \\"One More River To Cross\\", Pen and Sword, 1990Chris Bishop, \\"The encyclopedia of modern military weapons\\", Barnes & Noble Books, 1999, p. 30.Carter Malkasian, \\"The Korean War 1950-1953\\", Taylor & Francis, 2001, p. 52. However, the introduction of the Soviet IS-3 /IS-4 heavy tank along with Soviet T-54/T-55 forced the introduction of their own Conqueror heavy tank armed with a gun. A single design combining the firepower of the Conqueror's 120 mm gun with the mobility and general usefulness of the Centurion was seen as the ideal combination. Leyland, who had been involved in the Centurion tank, had built their own prototypes of a new tank design in 1956. Several aspects of the design were trialled by the production of the FV4202 \\"40-ton Centurion\\" with a reclined driver position and mantletless gun mounting. In effect, the FV4202 was a sightly modified Centurion chassis with a prototype of what would become the Chieftain turret, but armed with the 20pdr gun.Norman This work led to a War Office specification for a new tank. The General Staff specification drew on the experience of Centurion tanks in the Korean War as well as that of the Conqueror tank. The tank was expected to be able to engage the enemy at long range, from defensive positions, and be proof against medium artillery. To this end, the gun was to have a greater angle of depression than the 8 degrees of Conqueror and would be equipped with better frontal armour. The tank was expected to achieve a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute in the first minute and six per minute for the following four. The first few prototypes were provided for troop trials from 1959 which identified a number of changes. Improvements to address engine vibration and cooling resulted in a redesign of the rear hull. This increased the design weight to nearly 50 tons and accordingly the suspension (which had been designed for 45 tons) was strengthened. Trackpads had to be fitted to protect roads from damage and the ground clearance increased. The design was accepted in the early 1960s. Britain and Israel had collaborated on the development in its latter stages with a view to Israel purchasing and domestically producing the vehicle. Two prototypes were delivered as part of a four-year trial. However, it was eventually decided not to sell the marque to the Israelis (since, at that period of time in the late 1960s, the UK was more friendly towards the Arab states and Jordan than to Israel), which prompted them to follow their own development programme. In 1957, NATO had specified that its forces should use multi-fuel engines. The early BL Engine delivered around to the sprocket, which meant a top road speed of around and cross-country performance was limited. This was further hampered by the Horstmann coil spring suspension, which made it a challenge to drive cross country and provide the crew with a comfortable ride. Due to the cylinder linings being pressure fitted, coolant leaks within the cylinder block were common, resulting in white smoke billowing from the exhaust. In the late 1970s, engine design changed with the introduction of Belzona which was used to improve the lining seals. Engine output also increased, with later engines delivering some to the sprocket. This meant better performance and an increased speed. However, cross-country performance remained limited. Design Chieftain display at the Bovington tank museum, 2006 The design of the Chieftain included a heavily sloped hull and turret which greatly increased the effective thickness of the frontal armour ‚Äì on the glacis (from an actual thickness of ) and on the turret (from ).Richard Ogorkiewicz, Cold War, Hot Science: Applied Research in Britain's Defence Laboratories 1945‚Äì1990 (2002), p.128-129, edited by Robert Bud & Philip Gummett, NMSI Trading Ltd, It had a mantletless turret in order to take full advantage of reclining the vehicle up to ten degrees in a hull-down position. For security reasons early prototypes had a canvas screen covering the mantlet and a sheet metal box mounted over the sloping glacis plate to disguise the configuration of the vehicle. The driver lay semi-recumbent in the hull when his hatch was closed down which helped to reduce the profile of the forward glacis plate. The commander, gunner and loader were situated in the turret. To the left side of the turret was a large searchlight with infra- red capability in an armoured housing. A Leyland L60 engine pack displayed at the Bovington tank museum. The complete unit could be removed by the crane of the FV434. The Leyland L60 engine is a two-stroke opposed piston design intended for multi-fuel use so that it could run on whatever fuel was available. In practice the engine did not deliver the expected power and was unreliable, estimated to have a 90% breakdown rate but improvements were introduced to address this. Primary problems included cylinder liner failure, fan drive problems and perpetual leaks due to vibration and badly routed pipework. However, as the engine power improved the tank itself became heavier. The tank was steered by conventional tillers hydraulically actuating onto external brake discs. The discs worked via the epicyclic gearbox providing \\"regenerative\\" steering. The Merritt-Brown TN12 triple-differential gearbox was operated motorcycle-style with a kick up/kick down \\"peg\\" on the left, which actuated electro-hydraulic units in the gearbox, the accelerator cable was operated by the right foot. In the turret, the loader was on the left and the gunner on the right of the gun with the commander situated behind the gunner. The suspension was of the Horstmann bogie type with large side steel plates to protect the tracks and provide stand-off protection from hollow charge attack. 120 mm L11A5 rifled gun The main armament was the 120 mm L11A5 rifled gun. This differed from most contemporary main tank armament as it used projectiles and charges that were loaded separately, as opposed to a single fixed round. The charges were encased in combustible bags. Other tank guns such as the 120mm L1 gun on the Conqueror, needed to store the spent shell cartridges or eject them outside. The combustible charges were stored in 36 recesses surrounded by a pressurised water/glycol mixture ‚Äì so-called \\"wet- stowage\\". In the event of a hit penetrating the fighting compartment, the jacket would rupture soaking the charges and preventing a catastrophic propellant explosion.Simon Dunstan, Chieftain Main Battle Tank 1965‚Äì2003, Osprey Publishing, p.6 As there was no shell case, the firing of the charge was by vent tubes automatically loaded from a ten-round magazine on the breech. Due to the length of the gun, which required balancing, and the need for storage space, the turret has a large overhang to the rear. This contains radios, ammunition and fire control equipment and has further stowage externally. The gun could fire a wide range of ammunition but the most commonly loaded types were high explosive squash head (HESH), armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS), or practice round equivalents for both types. The Chieftain could store up to 64 projectiles (though a maximum of 36 APDS, limited by the propellant stowage). The gun was fully stabilised with a fully computerized integrated control system. The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial L8A1 7.62 mm machine gun and another 7.62 mm machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola. An advantage of using two-part ammunition was that in the case of inert rounds like APDS the loader could reach for the next round and hold it in his lap, ready to load while the gunner was acquiring the target and firing. This practice increases the rate of fire but would be hazardous with one-piece ammunition. Chieftain had an NBC protection system which Centurion lacked. The initial Fire-control system (FCS) was the Marconi FV/GCE Mk 4. A .50-inch (12.7 mm) ranging gun was mounted above the main gun (with 300 rounds available). This fired ranging shots out to a maximum of , at which point the tracer in the ranging rounds burned out although the high explosive tip still created a visible \\"splash\\" on impact. The tank commander had a rotating cupola with nine vision blocks -giving all round view, plus the 7.62 mm machine-gun and an infrared (IR) capable projector coaxial with the weapon. The aiming systems were provided for both the gunner and the tank commander; they had 1x or 10x selectable magnification power, increasing to x15 in the Mk5 and beyond, and they were replaceable with IR vision systems for night operations (3x magnification power). The commander could rotate his cupola to bring his sight onto a target and then engage the mechanism that brought the turret round on to the correct bearing so that the gunner could complete the aiming. The commander's controls had over-ride capability on those of the gunner. The left side of the turret had a large searchlight with an electrically controlled infra-red filter inside an armoured box, with a relatively long range ‚Äì up to .JP-4 dossier, Main Battle Tanks (1990), pp.35‚Äì36, edited by Ed.Ai. 1990, Florence From the beginning of the 1970s, the Mk 3/3 version replaced the ranging gun with a Barr and Stroud LF-2 laser rangefinder with a range. This allowed engagements at much longer ranges, and also could be linked to the fire control system, allowing more rapid engagements and changes of target. On later models, fire control was provided by the Marconi IFCS (Improved Fire Control System), using a digital ballistic computer. The upgrade was not finished until the end of 1980, when some examples (but not the majority) had the IR searchlight replaced with TOGS. Many later examples had Stillbrew armour, intended to defeat Soviet 125 mm tank guns and heavy anti-tank missiles. These became the Mark 11 version. Service Chieftain tanks of 14th/20th King's Hussars on parade with urban camouflage, Stra√üe des 17. Juni, West Berlin, 18 June 1989. Chieftain equipped British units of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) during the Cold War, defending West Germany against possible Warsaw Pact attack. Like its European competitors, Chieftain found a large export market in the Middle East, but unlike Centurion, it was not adopted by any other NATO or Commonwealth country. Chieftain proved itself capable in combat and able to be upgraded, both for overall improvement and to meet local requirements. It was continuously upgraded until the early 1990s, when it was replaced by Challenger 1. The final Chieftain version, which was used by the British Army until 1995, incorporated \\"Stillbrew\\" armour named after Colonel Still and John Brewer from the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE), the Improved Fire Control System (IFCS) and the Thermal Observation Gunnery Sight (TOGS). The last British Regiment equipped with Chieftain was the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, which was based at Aliwal Barracks, Tidworth. A former Iranian Army Chieftain Mk.5 main battle tank on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum Chieftain target hulks at Lulworth Ranges 2008 The first model was introduced in 1967. Chieftain was supplied to at least six countries, including Iran, Kuwait, Oman and Jordan. An agreement for sales to Israel and local production was cancelled by the British Government in 1969, despite considerable Israeli technical and tactical input into the development of the tank, especially the capacity to operate successfully in desert environments, and the provision for the tank to make good use of hull-down positioning. Two examples were delivered to and extensively trialled by the Israeli Armoured Corps. This experience spurred the creation of the indigenous Israeli Merkava, the development programme of which was led by General Israel Tal, who had worked closely with the British in the Anglo-Israeli Chieftain project. The largest foreign sale was to Iran, which, at the recommendation of General Tal, took delivery of 707 Mk-3P and Mk-5P (the letter P standing for Persia), as well as 187 FV4030-1, 41 ARV and 14 AVLB before the 1979 revolution., (Search UK to Iran, 1950‚Äì2008) Further planned deliveries of the more capable FV4030-2 (Shir 1) and FV4030-3 (Shir 2) series were cancelled at that point. It was in the Middle East that the Chieftain was to see all of its operational experience. First, it was used extensively by Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980‚Äì88, including the largest tank battle of the war, with mixed results as the Chieftain Mk 3/5 suffered from chronic engine problems and low power-to-weight ratio, making it unreliable and slow when manoeuvring over harsh terrain, which in turn made it prone to breakdowns in the midst of battle or a sluggish target and thus vulnerable to enemy tank fire. Out of the 875 Chieftain tanks that had started the war only 200 were left.The Global Arms Trade: A Handbook Andrew T. H. Tan Routledge. 2014. P.126 The Chieftain remains in service in Iran, the Mobarez tank being a locally upgraded version. Kuwait and the Battle of the Bridges Kuwait had 143 Chieftains on the eve of the 1990 Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait. Thirty-seven Chieftains of the Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade fought at the Battle of the Bridges against elements of the Iraqi Hammurabi and Medina divisions before withdrawing over the Saudi border. None of the brigade's tanks was lost in the battle, and the 35th Armored Brigade (known as Al-Fatah) became part of Joint Command Forces East during the 1991 Gulf War and was able to return into Kuwait undefeated. Besides those of the 35th Armored Brigade, the rest of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces' Chieftains (over 100) were either destroyed or captured by the invading forces after they had been abandoned by their Kuwaiti crews when their ammunition ran out.

The two Chieftain 900 prototypes were built in April 1982 and were exhibited the same year at the British Army Equipment Exhibition (BAEE). They were not fitted with real Chobham armour but were mocked up with cosmetic sheet-metal cladding to simulate the Chobham armour package. The project was abandoned by 1986. Khalid variant ; FV4030/1 Chieftain Mk. 5/3 (P) ¬´ Persia ¬ª : Also known as \\"Project 4030 Phase 1\\" or \\"Improved Chieftain\\". The Mk. 5/3P featured the Tank Laser Sight (TLS), the Muzzle Reference System (MRS), a fully automatic controller for the TN12 gearbox, a fuel capacity increase, thickened underbelly mine armour and shock absorbers fitted to the front and rear suspension units. 185 vehicles were built between August 1976 and late 1977/early 1978. ; FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1: Also known as \\"4030 Phase 2\\". This tank formed Phase 2 of the Iranian contract for the supply of a new generation of MBTs (Phase 1 being for an Improved Chieftain). This project began in 1974. Shir 1 incorporated the Chieftain hull front and turret casting. The rear of the hull was reconfigured to accept a new power pack comprising Rolls-Royce CV12 1200 HP engine , David Brown's TN37 transmission and new cooling group. An improved bogie suspension (Super Horstmann), new final drives and tracks were included. The first vehicle-ran in April 1977 and no production deliveries had taken place when the project was cancelled in February 1979. ; Khalid: Also known as \\"4030 Phase 2 Jordan\\". The sale of 274 MBTs was negotiated with Jordan in June 1979 following the cancellation of the Iranian contract. The Khalid tank is based on the Shir 1 design with the addition of the Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS), Tank Laser Sight (TLS) and the No 84 Day/Night Sight. The first 125 were reworked Shir 1's and the remaining 149 were new production tanks. The order has been completed, the first being delivered in July 1981. ;FV4030/3 Shir 2: Also known as \\"'4030 Phase 3'\\" Iranian variant. The Shir 2 represented a completely new-MBT incorporating Chobham armour (renamed \\"Pageant\\" to avoid diplomatic incident with the US government) to the hull and turret, with the rear of the hull similar in design to the Shir 1. The fire control, gun control and automotive systems were the same as Shir 1 with the following exceptions: Automotive - the option of adopting hydrogas suspension and command & control, the new No 84 commander's (PPE) day/night sight. The project began in 1974 and the first vehicle ran in October 1978. The production order was for 1,200 MBTs and production release given for 250 before cancellation in February 1979. Not delivered, the Shir 2 tanks became FV4030/4 Challenger 1 tanks after reworking at ROF Leeds. ;Mobarez Tank:Iranian upgraded version of Chieftain. : ;Chieftain/ T95: Development of the FV4201 Chieftain allowed for the interchangeability of guns with the U.S. T95 tank by means of exchanging turrets.

The project began in October 1969. A feasibility study was completed by February 1970 which led to MVEE being asked to design and produce a prototype within a year. This timescale was achieved, the MVEE produced the first prototype in February 1971. Although the project was officially discontinued in 1972, research work within MVEE continued until 1974. A paper study on a Mk. 2 version was carried out and was considered during the FMBT (Future Main Battle Tank) studies in 1974.

It belongs to the family's Cushitic branch. Overview Saho is spoken natively by the Saho people. They traditionally inhabit territory in Eritrea bounded by the bay of Erafayle in the east, the Laasi Ghed√© valleys in the south, and the Eritrean highlands to the west (the Shimejana district on the eastern flank of the South- or Debub region in what was formerly known as Akele Guzai province). This speech area is bordered by other Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities, with Tigre speakers on the west and Afar speakers on the east. In Ethiopia, Saho or Assawort is primarily spoken in the Tigray Region. It has about 200,000 speakers in total and four main dialects: Asawurta, Toroa Minifero, Eda, Tabota Hazu Hasabat-ara and Irob.Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics. The Saho also use the Arabic ( Special now Latin letters ) to document their history and render information. Also recently the language is being used on the cyberspace as a tool of communication. And there is on website completely designed with saho language. Saho is so closely related to the Cushitic Afar language, spoken as a mother tongue by the Afar people, that some linguists regard the two tongues as dialects of a single \\"Saho‚ÄìAfar language\\". Regardless, it has been shown that at least in their basic lexicon the two can be cleanly separated. Writing system Saho has three written versions: a version in the Latin alphabet, official in Eritrea; a version in the Ge'ez script, official in Ethiopia; and a version in the Ajami script with no official recognition.

The serial is set on an alien space station and in and around Seville. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker), his former travelling companion Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and his current companion Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant) work to save the younger Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) from the biogeneticist Dastari (Laurence Payne), who intends to steal the knowledge of how to travel in time from the Second Doctor's genetic make-up. Plot The Second Doctor and Jamie McCrimmon land the TARDIS on board Space Station Camera in the Third Zone on a mission for the Time Lords, who have also installed a teleport control on the TARDIS. The Doctor explains that the station is a research facility and that they have to talk to Dastari, the Head of Projects. The Androgum cook Shockeye drugs the meals of the station's scientists. The Doctor tells Dastari that the Time Lords want the time experiments of Kartz and Reimer stopped. The Doctor warns that the distortions from the Kartz-Reimer experiments are on the verge of threatening the fabric of time, but Dastari refuses to order them to cease, accusing the Time Lords of not wanting another race to discover the secrets of time travel. Dastari and the others collapse from the drugged meals. Chessene, an Androgum technologically augmented to mega-genius levels, lowers the station's defences to allow the Sontarans to attack. Jamie sees the Doctor appear to die by the Sontarans before fleeing. Inside the TARDIS, the Sixth Doctor has a vision of his second incarnation being put to death. Since he is still alive, he is concerned that he may have died in the past and only exists now as a temporal anomaly. He decides to consult his old friend Dastari to see if he can help. The Doctor and Peri arrive on the station and find no signs of life. The station computer demands that the Doctor leave and, when he refuses, tries to kill him and Peri by depressurising the passageway. The Doctor opens a hatch and drags his unconscious companion through to another section. The Doctor discovers Dastari's day journal and the Time Lords' objections to the Kartz- Reimer experiments. In Spain, Chessene, Shockeye and a Sontaran, Major Varl, take possession of a hacienda by killing its owner, Do√±a Arana. Dastari and the Sontaran Group Marshal Stike carry an unconscious Second Doctor towards the hacienda. Peri is attacked by a humanoid in rags. The Sixth Doctor and Peri find that Peri's attacker was Jamie, who has been hiding all the while. Under hypnosis, Jamie tells the Sixth Doctor that the Sontarans killed the Second Doctor. The Sixth Doctor explains to Jamie and Peri that what Jamie saw was an illusion designed to make people believe the Doctor was dead and not investigate further. He theorises that the Sontarans also kidnapped Dastari as he is the only biogeneticist in the galaxy who could isolate the symbiotic nuclei that gives Time Lords the molecular stability to travel through time. The Sixth Doctor puts himself into a telepathic trance to determine where his past incarnation is being held. He narrows it down to the Seville area, where the Sontaran spaceship landed. Dastari reveals his plan to dissect the Second Doctor's cell structure to isolate his symbiotic nuclei and give them to Chessene. The Second Doctor protests that her barbaric Androgum nature, coupled with the ability to time travel, will mean that there will be no limit to her evil. Finding the hacienda, Peri interrupts the operation. Sneaking into the cellar, the Sixth Doctor examines the Kartz-Reimer module, a prototype time machine modelled on Time Lord technology, explaining to Jamie how it works. The Sontarans overhear him. Outside, Shockeye knocks Peri out and brings her to the hacienda kitchen. Stike threatens to kill Jamie unless the Sixth Doctor gets into the module and primes it with his symbiotic print, and the Doctor does so. The Sixth Doctor primes the module, and he and Jamie escape the Sontarans. Chessene has a contingency plan after discovering the involvement of two Time Lords. She asks Dastari to implant the Second Doctor with some of Shockeye's genetic material, turning the Doctor into an Androgum. They also intend to eliminate the Sontarans. Chessene interrupts Shockeye when he attempts to cook an unconscious Peri, and stuns him so that Dastari can remove his genetic material. The Sixth Doctor revives Peri, and tells Jamie and her that what he revealed to the Sontarans was not true -- he had lied because he had heard Stike approaching. The machine worked for the Doctor, but will not for them because the Doctor has taken the briode nebuliser. Before they can release the Second Doctor and escape the hacienda, Shockeye shows up with Peri. Dastari has implanted the Second Doctor with a 50 percent Androgum inheritance, and when Shockeye wakes in a rage, he finds a kindred spirit in the transformed Doctor. They decide to go into the town to sample the local cuisine. Dastari lures the Sontarans into the cellar, where Chessene attacks them. Varl is killed, but Stike manages to escape. He tries to use the module, but without the nebuliser, it severely burns him. Stike staggers towards his battlecraft, forgetting about the self-destruct Varl had set. The ship explodes. The Sixth Doctor, Peri, and Jamie follow the Second Doctor into Seville, hoping to cure him before the change becomes complete. Dastari and Chessene are also looking for them, knowing that unless the Second Doctor undergoes a stabilising operation, he will eventually reject the Androgum transfusion. The Second Doctor and Shockeye go to Las Cadenas restaurant ordering gargantuan amounts of food. When the restaurant's owner Oscar demands that they pay, Shockeye fatally stabs Oscar, just as the Sixth Doctor and the others arrive. Shockeye leaves the Second Doctor, who slowly reverts to normal. As they leave the restaurant, Chessene and Dastari appear, taking them back to the hacienda at gunpoint. Chessene and Dastari find the nebuliser on the module missing, and the Sixth Doctor tells them how he primed the machine for Stike. To test the truth of the Doctor's claim, they replace the nebuliser and send Peri on a trip with the module. The Sixth Doctor, however, confirms to the Second Doctor that the nebuliser is sabotaged, with a thin interface layer so it would work once, for Peri. The Sixth Doctor frees himself, and goes to save Jamie from being eaten by Shockeye in the kitchen. He encounters Shockeye in the kitchen, and the Androgum wounds him with a knife. Shockeye pursues him through the grounds. The Doctor ambushes Shockeye, covering his head with Oscar's butterfly net and pressing the cyanide-soaked cotton wool to his face, killing him. Chessene sees the Doctor's blood and starts licking it. Dastari realises that no matter how augmented she may be, Chessene is still an Androgum, and decides to free the Second Doctor, Peri, and Jamie. When Chessene sees this, she shoots and kills Dastari. She tries to shoot the Second Doctor and Peri, but Jamie throws a knife at her wrist, making her drop the gun. Chessene goes into the module, hoping to escape, but the sabotaged module explodes, killing her. The Second Doctor uses a Stattenheim remote control to summon his TARDIS. As the Sixth Doctor and Peri make their way back to their own TARDIS, the Doctor tells her that from now on, it will be a healthy vegetarian diet for both of them. Production Working titles for this story included The Kraglon Inheritance and The Androgum Inheritance. Robert Holmes, a vegetarian, wrote the serial as an allegory about meat- eating, hunting and butchering. \\"Androgum\\" is an anagram of \\"gourmand\\". Elements from Robert Holmes's aborted project The Six Doctors were carried over to this story (as the production subtitles for the DVD release reveal). Holmes's original brief from producer John Nathan-Turner was to write a serial taking place in New Orleans, involving the Sontarans, the Second Doctor and Jamie, but the setting had to be changed to Spain instead when the expected funding for location filming in the United States fell through. Holmes was particularly disappointed that much of the humour involving the differences between Britain and America was lost in the rewrite. The only hint we get of this humour is in Episode 1, when the Sixth Doctor looks at Peri and says that Columbus \\"has a lot to answer for\\". According to the DVD commentary track, location filming was plagued by numerous small problems, including high heat that caused make-up to melt, a three-day delay to replace Troughton and Pearce's wigs (which had somehow got lost in shipping), Carmen G√≥mez' refusal to wear a costume designed for her, and a local stunt man (the truck driver) who refused to perform his stunt as it had been choreographed. Pearce also says that she was a last-minute replacement for another, unspecified actress who had to drop out of the production. A filmed scene with Oscar and Anita in the olive grove was discovered to have been ruined by a scratch on the negative, so Saxon and G√≥mez, who had already returned to England, had to be quickly brought back to Spain at considerable expense. This was the last of a number of stories in the \\"classic series\\" which included location filming outside the United Kingdom, starting with City of Death. In his 1986 interview for Starburst, script editor Eric Saward said he thought this story was \\"poorly directed\\".\\"The Revelations of a Script Editor\\". Starburst. September 1986. Issue 97. Page 16. Cast notes This story marked the final appearance of Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor and the final on-screen appearance of Frazer Hines as Jamie. The Second Doctor appearing much older in this feature, with noticeable grey hair, has been addressed in novelizations and audio books as there having been a significant amount of time passing between The War Games (1969) and the Second Doctor's regeneration in Spearhead from Space (1970). Broadcast and reception The Two Doctors was one of several stories from this era to provoke controversy over its depiction of violence. In 1985, Australasian Doctor Who Fan Club president Tony Howe criticised the murder of Oscar with a kitchen knife as being an instance of \\"sick, shock violence\\" that was present for \\"cheap shock value only\\". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded the serial two stars out of five, stating: \\"The Two Doctors wasn't dire, but the actors and audience deserved better.\\" In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell awarded The Two Doctors seven out of ten, describing it as \\"a Doctor Who version of Last of the Summer Wine as sponsored by the Vegetarian Society.\\" Commercial releases In print The novelisation of this serial, by Robert Holmes, was published in hardback and paperback in August 1985 as the 100th Doctor Who release by Target Books. This was Holmes's only complete novelisation and seeks to clear up some of the continuity errors in the original broadcast. With a gold foil- embossed cover, it was billed on release as the 100th novelisation and featured an introduction by John Nathan-Turner. Home media The Two Doctors was released on VHS in November 1993. It was released on DVD in the UK in September 2003 in a two-disc set as part of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary Celebration releases, representing the Colin Baker years, with many extra features, including the Jim'll Fix It sketch A Fix with Sontarans. The DVD contains a full-length commentary provided by director Peter Moffatt and actors Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Frazer Hines, and Jacqueline Pearce. The DVD was subsequently incorporated into the box set Bred for War, along with The Time Warrior, The Sontaran Experiment and The Invasion of Time. Following the sexual abuse accusations regarding Jimmy Savile, the DVD was withdrawn from sale but has since been rereleased with the offending sketch removed. The BBC has made the serial available for download on Apple iTunes. It was released in issue 45 of Doctor Who DVD Files.

Modern corduroy is most commonly composed of tufted cords, sometimes exhibiting a channel (bare to the base fabric) between the tufts. Both velvet and corduroy derive from fustian fabric. The fabric looks as if it is made from multiple cords laid parallel to each other and then stitched together. The word corduroy is from cord and duroy, a coarse woollen cloth made in England in the 18th century. The interpretation of the word as corde du roi (from French, the cord of the King) is a false etymology. Corduroy is considered a durable cloth. Corduroy is found in the construction of trousers, jackets and shirts. The width of the cord is commonly referred to as the size of the \\"wale\\" (i.e. the number of ridges per inch). The lower the \\"wale\\" number, the thicker the width of the wale (e.g., 4-wale is much thicker than 11-wale). Corduroy‚Äôs wale count per inch can vary from 1.5 to 21, although the traditional standard falls somewhere between 10 and 12. Wide wale is more commonly used in trousers and furniture upholstery (primarily couches); medium, narrow, and fine wale fabrics are usually found in garments worn above the waist. Corduroy is made by weaving extra sets of fibre into the base fabric to form vertical ridges called wales. The wales are built so that clear lines can be seen when they are cut into pile. ;The primary types of corduroy are: * Standard wale: 11 wales/inch, and available in many colours * Pincord/pinwale/needlecord: Pincord is the finest cord around with a count at the upper end of the spectrum (above 16) * Pigment dyed/printed corduroy: The process of colouring or printing corduroy with pigment dyes. The dye is applied to the surface of the fabric, then the garment is cut and sewn. When washed during the final phase of the manufacturing process, the pigment dye washes out in an irregular way, creating a vintage look. The colour of each garment becomes softer with each washing, and there is a subtle colour variation from one to the next.

Although corduroy has existed for a long time and was used in Europe since the 18th century, only in the 20th century did it become global - notably expanding in popularity during the 1970s. Other names Other names are often used for corduroy. Alternative names include: corded velveteen, elephant cord (the thick-stripes version), pin cord, Manchester cloth and cords. In continental Europe, corduroy is known as \\"Cord\\", \\"rib cord\\" or \\"rib velvet\\" - in parts of Europe such as Germany, Czechia, Holland and Belgium it used to be simply known as \\"Manchester\\" - that still remains the current name for corduroy in Swedish. In Portugal, corduroy is associated with a completely different type of fabric, \\"bombazine\\", and is referred to as such. In Greece and Cyprus they are known as kotl√© pants.

The play premi√®red on 19 April 1893 at London's Haymarket Theatre. Like Wilde's other society plays, it satirizes English upper-class society. Following its publication, critic William Archer wrote that Wilde‚Äôs plays ‚Äúmust be taken on the very highest plane of modern English drama.‚Äù It has been performed on stages in Europe and North America since his death in 1900. Synopsis The play is set in \\"The Present\\" (i.e. 1893). Act I ;The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase The play opens with a party on a terrace in Lady Hunstanton's estate. The upper class guests spend the better part of Act I exchanging social gossip and small talk. Lady Caroline Pontefract patronizes an American visitor, Hester Worsley, and proceeds to give her own opinion of everyone in the room (and her surrounding life). Lady Caroline also denounces Hester's enthusiasm for Gerald Arbuthnot until Gerald himself enters to proclaim that Lord Illingworth, a powerful, flirtatious male political figure, intends to take him under his wing as secretary. This is great news for Gerald, as being Lord Illingworth's secretary would be the young man's first step to a life of financial/political success. The guests then discuss the rumors surrounding Lord Illingworth's aim for being a foreign ambassador, while Lady Hunstanton sends a letter through her footman to Gerald's mother, inviting her to the party. Gerald offers to take Hester for a walk, leaving the remaining guests to gossip further about their social lives. Lady Hunstanton and Lady Stutfield comment on the yet unseen Lord Illingworth's amoral qualities towards women when the man himself enters the terrace. He declines their thanks for his hiring of Gerald Arbuthnot and says that he hired him out of personal interest. Lord Illingworth remains near Mrs. Allonby during the entire exchange until the two of them leave for the conservatory together, following a discussion of Hester's background and wealthy father. A footman enters with a letter from Mrs. Arbuthnot, stating that she will come to the party after dinner. When Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby return, the remaining guests have already moved to have tea in another room. The two characters have a witty conversation involving marriage and women and men until Gerald and Hester enter the room. They have some short small talk, and Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby are again left alone. Their discussion turns toward Hester when Mrs. Allonby reprehends the young American for her casual talk of being eighteen and a Puritan. Lord Illingworth expresses that he rather admires Hester's beauty and actually uses the conversation to assert his flirtations toward Mrs. Allonby, claiming that he has never met a woman so puritanical as Hester that she would steadfastly resist all and any advances. Mrs. Allonby asserts that Hester is sincere in her desire to be left alone, but Illingworth interprets her remarks as a playful challenge. Lord Illingworth notices Mrs. Arbuthnot's letter lying on a table and remarks that the handwriting on the envelope seems familiar. When Mrs. Allonby asks who the handwriting reminds him of, he carelessly mentions \\"a woman of no importance.\\" Act II ;Drawing room at Hunstanton Gerald's mother arrives at the end of an argument between Hester and the upper-class women. Lord Illingworth enters shortly after, and Gerald uses the opportunity to introduce him to Mrs. Arbuthnot. The three share an uncomfortable exchange, as Mrs. Arbuthnot (to Gerald's dismay) can only partially express her disapproval of Illingworth's offer. Lord Illingworth excuses himself, and Lady Hunstanton calls everyone into her music-room soon after. Illingworth, however, asks to remain behind to speak with Mrs. Arbuthnot. What follows is the revelation that Gerald is the illegitimate child of Mrs. Arbuthnot and Lord Illingworth, once known as George Harford. Years ago, Mrs. Arbuthnot and George Harford conceived a child, yet Harford refused to marry Arbuthnot. Harford had offered to provide financial security through his mother, but according to Mrs. Arbuthnot, it was his refusal to marry that forced her to leave him and live an arduous life as a scandalous single mother. Mrs. Arbuthnot retains a strong bitterness toward Illingworth, yet also begs him to leave her son alone, expressing that after twenty years of being a mother, Gerald is all she has. She refuses to allow Gerald to stay with his father, but Illingworth questions how she will force Gerald to do what she wants. He tells Mrs. Arbuthnot that Gerald should be able to choose his own future. Gerald then enters, and Lord Illingworth assures him and his mother that Gerald has the highest qualities that the man had hoped for in a secretary. Illingworth demands any other reason for Mrs. Arbuthnot to protest against Gerald's opportunity. Unwilling to reveal her son's true heritage, Mrs. Arbuthnot says that she has no other reason. Act III ;The Hall at Hunstanton Chase Act III opens with Gerald and Lord Illingworth talking about Mrs. Arbuthnot. Gerald speaks of his admiration and protective attitude toward his mother, expressing that she is a great woman and wondering why she has never told him of his father. Lord Illingworth agrees that his mother is a great woman, but he further explains that great women have certain limitations that inhibit the desires of young men. Leading the conversation into a cynical talk about society and marriage, Lord Illingworth says that he has never been married and that Gerald will have a new life under his wing. Soon the other guests enter, and Lord Illingworth entertains them with his invigorating views on a variety of subjects, such as comedy and tragedy, savages, and world society. Everything Lord Illingworth has to say opposes the norm and excites his company, leaving Mrs. Arbuthnot room to say that she would be sorry to hold his views. During a discussion of sinful women, she also opposes Lady Hunstanton's later opinion by saying that ruining a woman's life is unforgivable. When Lady Hunstanton's company finally breaks up, Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby leave to look at the moon. Gerald attempts to follow, but his mother protests and ask him to take her home. Gerald says that he must first say goodbye to Lord Illingworth and also reveals that he will be going to India with him at the end of the month. Mrs. Arbuthnot is then left alone with Hester, and they resume the previous conversation about women. Mrs. Arbuthnot is disgusted by Hester's view that the sins of parents are suffered by their children. Recognizing that Mrs. Arbuthnot is waiting for her son to return, Hester decides to fetch Gerald. Gerald soon returns alone, however, and he becomes frustrated with his mother's continued disapproval for what he sees as an opportunity to earn his mother's respect and the love of Hester. Remembering Hester's views, Mrs. Arbuthnot decides to tell her son the truth about his origin and her past life with Lord Illingworth, but she does so in the third person, being sure to describe the despair that betrayed women face. Gerald remains unmoved, however, so Mrs. Arbuthnot withdraws her objections. Hester then enters the room in anguish and flings herself into Gerald's arms, exclaiming that Lord Illingworth has \\"horribly insulted\\" her. He has apparently tried to kiss her. Gerald almost attacks Illingworth in a rage when his mother stops him the only way she knows how: by telling him that Lord Illingworth is his father. With this revelation, Gerald takes his mother home, and Hester leaves on her own. Act IV ;Sitting room in Mrs. Arbuthnot's House at Wrockley Act IV opens with Gerald writing a letter in his mother's sitting room, the contents of which will ask his father to marry Mrs. Arbuthnot. Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby are shown in, intending to visit Mrs. Arbuthnot. The two comment on her apparent good taste and soon leave when the maid tells them that Mrs. Arbuthnot has a headache and will not be able to see anyone. Gerald says that he has given up on being his father's secretary, and he has sent for Lord Illingworth to come to his mother's estate at 4 o'clock to ask for her hand in marriage. When Mrs. Arbuthnot enters, Gerald tells her all that he has done and that he will not be his father's secretary. Mrs. Arbuthnot exclaims that his father must not enter her house, and the two argue over her marrying Gerald's father. Gerald claims that the marriage is her duty, while Mrs. Arbuthnot retains her integrity, saying that she will not make a mockery of marriage by marrying a man she despises. She also tells of how she devoted herself to the dishonor of being a single mother and has given her life to take care of her son. Hester overhears this conversation and runs to Mrs. Arbuthnot. Hester says she has realized that the law of God is love and offers to use her wealth to take care of the man she loves and the mother she never had. After ensuring that Mrs. Arbuthnot must live with them, Gerald and Hester leave to sit in the garden. The maid announces the arrival of Lord Illingworth, who forces himself past the doorway and into the house. He approaches Mrs. Arbuthnot, telling her that he has resolved to provide financial security and some property for Gerald. Mrs. Arbuthnot merely shows him Gerald and Hester in the garden and tells Lord Illingworth that she no longer needs help from anyone but her son and his lover. Illingworth then sees Gerald's unsealed letter and reads it. Lord Illingworth claims that while it would mean giving up his dream as a foreign ambassador, he is willing to marry Mrs. Arbuthnot to be with his son. Mrs. Arbuthnot refuses to marry him and tells Lord Illingworth that she hates him, adding that her hate for Illingworth and love for Gerald sharpen each other. She also assures Lord Illingworth that it was Hester who made Gerald despise him. Lord Illingworth then admits his defeat with the cold notion that Mrs. Arbuthnot was merely his plaything for an affair, calling her his mistress. Mrs. Arbuthnot then slaps him with his own glove before he can call Gerald his bastard. Lord Illingworth, dazed and insulted, gathers himself and leaves after a final glance at his son. Mrs. Arbuthnot falls onto the sofa sobbing. When Gerald and Hester enter, she cries out for Gerald, calling him her boy, and then asks Hester if she would have her as a mother. Hester assures her that she would. Gerald sees his father's glove on the floor, and when he asks who has visited, Mrs. Arbuthnot simply replies, \\"A man of no importance.\\" Original production Herbert Beerbohm Tree, actor-manager of London's Haymarket Theatre, asked Oscar Wilde to write him a play following the success of Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan at the St. James Theatre. Wilde was initially quite reluctant since the character Tree would take was not the sort of part he associated with the actor: Wilde went so far as to describe Lord Illingworth as himself. This appears to have made Tree all the more determined and thus Wilde wrote the play while staying at a farmhouse near Felbrigg in Norfolk -- with Lord Alfred Douglas -- while his wife and sons stayed at Babbacombe Cliff near Torquay. Tree enjoyed the part of Lord Illingworth and continued to play it outside the theatre, leading Wilde to comment \\"every day Herbert becomes de plus en plus oscaris√©\\" (\\"more and more Oscarised\\"). The play opened on 19 April 1893. The first performance was a great success, though Wilde, while taking his bow as the author, was booed, apparently because of a line stating \\"England lies like a leper in purple\\" -- which was later removed. The Prince of Wales attended the second performance and told Wilde not to alter a single line.Richard Ellmann, Oscar Wilde, p. 360. The play was also performed in New York and was due to go on tour when Wilde was arrested and charged with indecency and sodomy following his feud with the Marquess of Queensberry over the Marquess' son, Lord Alfred Douglas. The tour was cancelled. Criticisms A Woman of No Importance has been described as the \\"weakest of the plays Wilde wrote in the Nineties\\".Richard Ellmann, Oscar Wilde 357. Many critics note that much of the first act-and-a-half surrounds the witty conversations of members of the upper-classes, the drama only beginning in the second half of the second act with Lord Illingworth and Mrs Arbuthnot finding their pasts catching up with them.Martin Rain Review Like many of Wilde's plays, the main theme is the secrets of the upper-classes: Lord Illingworth discovers that the young man he has employed as a secretary is in fact his illegitimate son, a situation similar to the central plot of Lady Windermere's Fan. Secrets would also affect the characters of The Importance of Being Earnest. In one scene, Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby (whose unseen husband is called Ernest) share the line \\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy\\", \\"No man does. That is his.\\" Algernon would make the same remark in The Importance of Being Earnest. Characters of the play ;Lord Illingworth : He is a man of about 45 and a bachelor. He is witty and clever and a practised flirt, who knows how to make himself agreeable to women. He is Mrs. Arbuthnot's former lover and seducer and the father of Gerald Arbuthnot. Also, he has a promising diplomatic career and is shortly to become Ambassador to Vienna. He enjoys the company of Mrs. Allonby, who has a similar witty and amoral outlook to his own, and who also engages in flirting. His accidental acquaintance with Gerald, to whom he offers the post of private secretary, sets in motion the chain of events that form the main plot of the play. Illingworth is a typical Wildean dandy. ;Mrs. Rachel Arbuthnot : Apparently a respectable widow who does good work among the poor and is a regular churchgoer. She declines invitations to dinner parties and other social amusements, although she does visit the upper class characters at Lady Hunstanton's, since they all appear to know her and her son, Gerald. However, the audience soon realize that she has a secret past with Lord Illingworth who is the father of her son, Gerald. ;Gerald Arbuthnot : The illegitimate son of Mrs. Arbuthnot and Lord Illingworth. Gerald's young and rather inexperienced character represents the desire to find a place in society, and gain high social standing. His naivety allows him to accept uncritically what society deems as proper, and his belief in honour and duty is what leads him to insist upon his parents' marriage. ;Mrs. Allonby : A flirtatious woman who has a bit of a reputation for controversy. She is not the stereotypical female character and exchanges witty repartee with Lord Illingworth, indeed she could be viewed as a female dandy. It is she who dares Illingworth to \\"kiss the Puritan.\\" ;Miss Hester Worsley : As an American Puritan and an outsider to the British society in the play, Hester is in an ideal position to witness its faults and shortcomings more clearly than those who are part of it. Hester is both an orphan and an heiress, which allows her to \\"adopt\\" Mrs. Arbuthnot as her mother at the end of the play. ;Jane, Lady Hunstanton : The host of the party. Means well but is quite ignorant, shown in her conversation and lack of knowledge. Could be seen as portraying the typical Victorian aristocrat. ;Lady Caroline Pontefract : A very strong bully, shown by her belittling of Mr. Kelvil whom she constantly refers to as Mr. \\"Kettle\\". Her traditionalist views are in direct contrast to Mrs Allonby. ;The Ven. Archdeacon Daubeny, D.D. : Seen as the 'ultimate priest' his willingness to 'sacrifice' his free time for the benefit of his wife who is seen as an invalid of dramatic proportions. Shows his discomfort at being within the upper-class social circle. ;Lady Stutfield : A naive and intellectually restricted character who shows her lack of vocabulary with constant repetitions such as her use of the phrase, \\"Quite, Quite\\". However this view is a misconception, and those who study the women characters in depth will find Lady Stutfield to be full of ulterior motives and desperate for male attention. ;Mr. Kelvil, M.P. : A stuffily and thoroughly modern progressive moralist. He earnestly wishes to improve society and in particular the lot of the lower classes, but seems to lack the charisma and charm to succeed -- for example, he chooses to discuss the monetary standard of bimetallism with Lady Stutfield. ;Lord Alfred Rufford : A stereotypically lazy aristocrat who is constantly in debt with no intentions of paying back his debtors due to him spending other people's money on luxury items such as jewelry. ;Sir John Pontefract : Husband to Lady Caroline Pontefract, he is a quiet man who allows his wife to control their relationship. He seems weary of his wife's behaviour, constantly correcting her mispronunciation of Mr. Kelvil's name. ;Farquhar, Butler ;Francis, Footman ;Alice, Servant '''  Themes and ideas   Money  In A Woman of No Importance, money is presented as unlimited due to the majority of the characters belonging to the luxurious aristocracy, who rely on the fortune provided by their predecessors so they have gotten away with never working a day in their lives. However, Mrs. Arbuthnot has had to struggle through life in order to supply herself and her son, Gerald, the basics in life. This symbolises the rest of the population of Victorian Britain, who have had to work hard whilst the upper classes are given an unfair advantage, highlighting the massive divide in Victorian society at that time.  Innocence  Innocence in A Woman of No Importance is presented in the character of Hester. She is an American girl who is foreign to the beliefs of the British aristocracy and their uptight morals and etiquette. Hester is often taken aback by their views and so are the others by her. She represents the new woman emerging of the new world and due to this is considered na√Øve and has a hidden agenda. However, she finds the others far too materialistic and inclined to judge people too harshly. This replicates the beliefs held by the aristocracy in Victorian Britain.

Fought between Portugal and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde, an armed independence movement backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union, the war is commonly referred to as \\"Portugal's Vietnam\\" due to the large numbers of men and amounts of material expended in a long, mostly guerrilla war and the internal political turmoil it created in Portugal. The war ended when Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, granted independence to Guinea-Bissau, followed by Cape Verde a year later. Background thumb|left|Map of Portuguese-held (green), disputed (yellow) and rebel-held areas (red) territory in Portuguese Guinea. (1970) Portuguese Guinea (as well as the nearby Cape Verde archipelago) had been claimed by Portugal since 1446 and was a major trading post for commodities and African slaves during the 18th century, before the former had been outlawed by the Portuguese authorities. The interior was however not fully controlled by the Portuguese until the latter half of the 19th century. Sporadic fighting continued during the early 20th century and the Bijag√≥s Islands were not pacified under Portuguese rule until 1936. The Portuguese Guinea was dependent from the government of Cape Verde until 1887, when it gained the status of a separate overseas province of Portugal. In 1892, it received the status of autonomous district, becoming again a province in 1896. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Portuguese Guinea started to be referred to as \\"colony\\", despite still having the generic status of overseas province. With the effectiveness of the Portuguese Colonial Act of 1930, the designation \\"colony\\" fully replaced that of \\"province\\". In 1952, by a constitutional amendment, Portuguese Guinea became again referred as an overseas province, losing the status of \\"colony\\". While there had always been local resistance it was not until 1956 the first liberation movement was founded by Am√≠lcar Cabral and Rafael Barbosa, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The first major activity of the PAIGC was a strike by dock-workers in Bissau on August 3, 1959. The colonial police violently repressed the strike and more than 50 people died, the incident became known as the Pijiguiti Massacre. The massacre led to a major upswing of popular support for the PAIGC. By 1960, it was decided to move headquarters to Conakry in neighboring Republic of Guinea (former French Guinea) in order to prepare for an armed struggle. On April 18, 1961 PAIGC together with FRELIMO of Mozambique, MPLA of Angola and MLSTP of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe formed the Conference of Nationalist Organizations of the Portuguese Colonies (CONCP) during a conference in Morocco. The main goal of the organization was cooperation of the different national liberation movement in Portuguese colonies. Portuguese Overseas Armed Forces and the PAIGC Revolutionary leader Am√≠lcar Cabral The war in Guinea has been termed \\"Portugal's Vietnam\\". The main indigenous revolutionary insurgent movement, the Marxist African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde or PAIGC was well-trained, well-led, and equipped and received substantial support from safe havens in neighbouring countries like Senegal and Guinea- Conakry. The jungles of Guinea and the proximity of the PAIGC's allies near the border proved to be of significant advantage in providing tactical superiority during cross-border attacks and resupply missions for the guerrillas. In 1961 PAIGC commenced sabotage operations in Guinea-Bissau. At the start of hostilities the Portuguese had only two infantry companies in Guinea Bissau and these concentrated in the main towns giving the insurgents free rein in the countryside. The PAIGC blew up bridges, cut telegraph lines, destroyed sections of the highways, established arms caches and hideouts, and destroyed Fula villages and minor administrative posts. In late 1962 the Portuguese launched an offensive and evicted the PAIGC cadres that had not integrated with the local population. Open hostilities broke out in January 1963 when guerrillas from the PAIGC attacked the Portuguese garrison in Tite, near the Corubal River, south of Bissau, the capital of Portuguese Guinea. Similar guerrilla actions quickly spread across the colony, mainly in the south. The geography, dense forests with numerous waterways, were favourable to guerrilla activity. The PAIGC had few weapons ‚Äì perhaps only one submachine gun and two pistols per group ‚Äì so attacked Portuguese convoys to gain more weapons. Each group fought in isolation and established a forest based independently from the others. Many groups were formed on tribal and religious grounds. These groups began to abuse the locals and people began to flee the ‚Äúliberated‚Äù zones. The central PAIGC command were horrified and considered this military ‚Äúcommandism‚Äù. Around Oct 1963 the Portuguese began to retaliate against PAIGC activity with bomber raids; by the end of 1963 some villages had been abandoned as the occupants took to the forest. In 1964 PAIGC opened their second front in the north. In April 1964 the Portuguese launched a counter- offensive. They attacked the PAIGC held island of Como in the south of the country. 3,000 Portuguese, with air support, were involved but after 65 days were forced to withdraw. The PAIGC harassed the Portuguese during the rainy season. At some point in 1964 Portuguese Air Force planners failed to verify their target and bombed Portuguese troops. In retaliation Portuguese soldiers and sailors attacked the squadron barracks in the colony's capital Bissau. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of the country; that same year the PAIGC expanded its attacks in the northern area of the country, where at the time only the Front for the Liberation and Independence of Guinea (FLING), a minor insurgent force, was operating. By this time, the PAIGC, led by Am√≠lcar Cabral, began openly receiving military support from the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba. A Portuguese air force Lockheed P-2 Neptune, 1970s The success of PAIGC guerilla operations forced the Ex√©rcito Portugu√™s do Ultramar (Portuguese overseas armed forces) deployed in Portuguese Guinea on the defensive at an early stage; the latter were forced to limit their response to defending territories and cities already held. Unlike Portugal's other African territories, successful small-unit Portuguese counterinsurgency tactics were slow to evolve in Guinea. Defensive operations, where soldiers were dispersed in small numbers to guard critical buildings, farms, or infrastructure were particularly devastating to the regular Portuguese infantry, who became vulnerable to guerrilla attacks outside of populated areas by the forces of the PAIGC.Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, Portugal's African Wars, New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., (1974), pp. 140-144 They were also demoralized by the steady growth of PAIGC liberation sympathizers and recruits among the rural population. In a relatively short time, the PAIGC had succeeded in reducing Portuguese military and administrative control of the country to a relatively small area of Guinea. The scale of this success can be seen in the fact that native Guineans in the 'liberated territories' ceased payment of debts to Portuguese landowners as well as payment of taxes to the colonial administration. The branch stores of the Companhia Uni√£o Fabril (CUF), Mario Lima Whanon, and Manuel Pinto Brand√£o companies were seized and inventoried by the PAIGC in the areas they controlled, while the use of Portuguese currency in the areas under guerilla control was banned. In order to maintain the economy in the liberated territories, the PAIGC was impelled at an early stage to establish its own Marxist administrative and governmental bureaucracy, which organized agricultural production, educated farm workers on protecting crops from destruction from government attacks, and opened collective armaz√©ns do povo (people's stores) to supply urgently needed tools and supplies in exchange for agricultural produce. By 1967 the PAIGC had carried out 147 attacks on Portuguese barracks and army encampments, and effectively controlled 2/3 of Portuguese Guinea. The next year, Portugal began a new campaign against the guerrillas with the arrival of the new governor of the colony, General Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola. General Sp√≠nola instituted a series of civil and military reforms, intended to first contain, then roll back the PAIGC and its control of much of the rural portion of Portuguese Guinea. This included a 'hearts and minds' propaganda campaign designed to win the trust of the indigenous population, an effort to eliminate some of the discriminatory practices against native Guineans, a massive construction campaign for public works including new schools, hospitals, improved telecommunications and road networks, and a large increase in recruitment of native Guineans into the Portuguese armed forces serving in Guinea as part of an Africanisation strategy. The Portuguese conducted many search and destroy operation against the PAIGC 20 km from the frontier. On one occasion five helicopters landed 50 white plus some African soldiers. 36 FARP men under Bobo, commander of the Sambuya zone, drew the Portuguese forces into a wooded area. Bobo launched an ambush 1700 hours, inflicted casualties, and forced the Portuguese to withdraw. The PAIGC claimed the Portuguese suffered five dead and several wounded against their own four wounded. In 1966 the Portuguese attempted four large unsuccessful search-and-destroy sweeps of Iracunda. Each included several hundred conscripts with automatic weapons, mortars, bazookas, and air support. Warned by the peasants or by their own reconnaissance patrols the PAIGC pulled back, loosely encircled the Portuguese, and launched night attacks to break up the column. The insurgents would sometimes feint at the end of the line to distract attention from the main attack elsewhere. The PAIGC considered the conscripts inept in the jungle. In Mar 1968 the PAIGC conducted an attack against the main Portuguese airfield just outside Bissau. The airfield was protected by wire, minefields and blockhouses. 13 volunteers infiltrated to the edge of the field and fired into the base, damaging planes on the ground, hangars, and other installations. They then withdrew with no casualties. The Portuguese stationed an infantry company at Madina do Boe in the east near the border with the Republic of Guinea. With few inhabitants and structures to protect, and a long permeable frontier to guard, the company ended up just protecting themselves. Despite the fact there was no real benefit to keep them there the authorities refused to withdraw the unit until 1969. As feared the PAIGC used the withdrawal as a PR opportunity with foreign journalists. In mid-1969 the PAIGC launched Operation Tenaz against Portuguese positions around Bafata, north of the River Corubal. They started by secretly depositing ammunition in dumps to the rear of areas of engagement. Reconnaissance was provided by two bi-groups that infiltrated the area to discover the Portuguese dispositions. Then two strike forces of several hundred men entered the area. \\"Africanisation\\" of the Conflict PAIGC soldiers at a checkpoint in 1974 Until the 1950s, the Portuguese military forces permanently stationed in Guinea consisted of a small force of locally recruited African colonial soldiers (ca√ßadores indigenas) commanded by white officers. NCOs were a mixture of whites, overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato). These discriminatory colour bars to service were eliminated as part of the Africanization policy of General Sp√≠nola, which called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese military forces in Africa. Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the Portuguese Armed Forces.Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), , p. 340 The first of these was the African Commandos (Comandos Africanos), consisting of a battalion of commandos composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers). The second was the African Special Marines (Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos), Marine units entirely composed of black soldiers. The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea in an attempt to interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. General Sp√≠nola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating in the establishment of all- black military formations such as the Black Militias (Mil√≠cias negras) commanded by Major Carlos Fabi√£o. By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the Comandos Africanos. On the eve of Guinean independence in 1974 the total Portuguese force in the territory numbered about 31,000; of which 24,800 were black and 6,200 white. Tactical Changes A destroyed Portuguese armoured car in Guinea-Bissau Military tactical reforms by Portuguese commanders included new naval amphibious operations to overcome some of the mobility problems inherent in the underdeveloped and marshy areas of the country. These new operations utilized Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE) (special marine assault detachments) as strike forces. The Fuzileiros Especiais were lightly equipped with folding-stock m/961 (G3) rifles, 37mm rocket launchers, and light machine guns such as the Heckler & Koch HK21 to enhance their mobility in the difficult, swampy terrain. Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces increased their offensive posture, in the form of raids into PAIGC-controlled territory. At this time Portuguese forces also adopted unorthodox means of countering the insurgents, including attacks on the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Am√≠lcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to increase its strength, and began to heavily press Portuguese defense forces. Portuguese Fiat G.91 fighter-bomber. During the War, the Portuguese Air Force employed the G.91 in the theatres of Guinea and Mozambique. In 1970 the Portuguese Air Force (FAP) began to use similar weapons to those the US was using in the Vietnam War: napalm and defoliants in order to find the insurgents or at least deny them the cover and concealment needed for rebel ambushes. In an effort to hamper assistance to the PAIGC from the neighboring Republic of Guinea, Portugal commenced Opera√ß√£o Mar Verde or Operation Green Sea on 22 November 1970 in an attempt to overthrow Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©, the leader of the Republic of Guinea and staunch PAIGC ally, and cut off supply lines to PAIGC insurgents. The operation involved a daring raid on Conakry, a PAIGC safe haven, in which 220 Portuguese Fuzileiros (amphibious assault troops) and 200 Guinean anti-Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© insurgents attacked the city. The attempted coup d'√©tat failed, though the Portuguese managed to destroy several PAIGC ships and air force assets and freed all the 26 Portuguese POWs. One immediate result of Operation Green Sea was an escalation in the conflict, with countries such as Algeria and Nigeria now offering support to the PAIGC as well as the Soviet Union, which sent warships to the region (known by NATO as the West Africa Patrol) in a show of force calculated to deter future Portuguese amphibious attacks on the territory of the Republic of Guinea. The United Nations passed several resolutions condemning all the Portuguese cross- border attacks in Guinea, like the United Nations Security Council Resolution 290 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 295. In general, the PAIGC in Guinea was the best armed, trained, and led of all the guerrilla movements. After 1968 PAIGC forces were increasingly supplied with modern Soviet weapons and equipment, most notably SA-7 rocket launchers, radar-controlled AA cannon, and even jet aircraft in the form of several Ilyushin Il-14 bombers.Chilcote, Ronald H., The Struggle for Guinea-Bissau, Africa Today, July 197), pp. 57-61Dos Santos, Manuel, Disparar os Strela, Depoimentos, Quinta-feira, 28 de Maio de 2009, retrieved 26 May 2011 These weapons effectively undermined Portuguese air superiority, preventing the destruction by air of PAIGC encampments in territory it controlled. By 1970 the PAIGC even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly MIGs and to operate Soviet- supplied amphibious assault crafts and APCs. Assassination of Am√≠lcar Cabral As part of the efforts to undermine the organizational structure of PAIGC, Portugal had tried to capture Am√≠lcar Cabral for several years. After the failure of capturing him in 1970 during Operation Green Sea the Portuguese started using agents within the PAIGC to remove Cabral. Together with a disgruntled former associate, agents assassinated Am√≠lcar Cabral on the 20th January 1973 in Conakry, Guinea. The assassination happened less than 15 months before end of hostilities.

In some countries they live in kennels at the track. Currently, most Greyhound adoption programs are based in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In Europe groups deal with dogs from a variety of sources; for example, in Spain, ex-hunting dogs are often in need of rescuing along with Greyhounds. Origins and work of the greyhound-adoption movement The Greyhound adoption movement grew out of a concern by a diverse community of people about the welfare among dogs in the commercial racing industry. Greyhound adoption was started by the greyhound industry in the late 1970s. Greyhound Pets of America (GPA) was established in 1987 for the purpose of finding homes for ex-racing greyhounds, and educating the public on the suitability and availability of greyhounds as pets. GPA is the largest non- profit greyhound adoption group. Since its creation GPA has adopted out over 65,000 greyhounds. In 1989 David Wolf founded the National Greyhound Adoption Program (NGAP) mostly with his own resources. He has become the most controversial figure in the greyhound adoption community, and is one of the most outspoken critics of the greyhound racing industry. The Greyhound Project maintains a directory of hundreds of greyhound adoption agencies throughout the world. Over time as the number of adoption groups has grown, a deep ideological division regarding Greyhound racing has developed. Some groups are generally opposed to any form of Greyhound racing for any purpose. Others are officially racing neutral, meaning they neither oppose nor endorse dog racing. Historically Greyhounds have had a reputation for being gentle, people- centered dogs, and \\"par-excellence for persons wishing for a companion for themselves or their children\\".George A. Palmer, Secrets and Mysteries of Educating Animals (Portland, IN: Sun Job Printing Department, 1890), 61-62. When Greyhound adoption first started in the United States, many people associated with racing argued that Greyhounds did not make suitable pets. However, as the number of greyhounds successfully transitioning from tracks to households has risen, many people have come to believe that greyhounds are good companions. They describe Greyhounds as gentle and affectionate dogs who adapt easily to household life because they have clean, short coats and require only moderate exercise. Care Medical care Some Greyhounds may require medical and hygiene care when they first come to adoption groups, however this is not usually the case. Occasionally the Greyhound may require. * Dental cleaning * Worming (Usually done by the Greyhound trainer every 3 months) * Vaccinations (Usually done annually by the Greyhound trainer) * Bathing * Clipping nails Living conditions Greyhounds living with adoption groups generally receive one of two types of care: pet boarding kennels or foster homes. Several adoption groups use pet boarding kennels, which are similar to those used by the tracks in the United States. These kennels generally allow large spaces for each dog; the dogs also receive time in outdoor runs. Other groups feel that the best way to prepare the dogs for living in homes is to provide them with a foster home. The owner of the retiring Greyhound generally pays for the medical care and food for the dogs while in their care, allowing the foster \\"family\\" to train the dog and provide for his or her day-to-day needs. There is some debate within the adoption community about which technique is better. The trade off is essentially quality of living situation vs. number of animals helped. It is generally accepted that by keeping former racers in pet boarding kennels, the group can help a larger number of dogs more effectively, while groups that have a foster program can provide a better living situation for the dog more quickly. Behavior of adopted greyhounds A blue female greyhound relaxing Like any dog, greyhounds vary widely in their temperament, behavior, levels of activity, and in virtually all other aspects of their personality. As they are accustomed to a particular regimented environment at the track, they may adapt to life in a human home slowly, gradually overcoming fears of new sounds and experiences. Greyhounds may not immediately understand windows and glass doors, attempting to move through them, and may require an introduction to staircases and slippery floor surfaces. Although usually well-socialized with other greyhounds, ex-racers often have limited skills for living outside of the racing kennel. However, most Greyhounds are quick learners. They tend to be out-going, happy and sociable with people and seem to relish human contact, even following owners from room to room at home (known colloquially as being a \\"Velcro dog\\"). Some Greyhounds are more timid and can for a time have difficulty coping with new people or situations. A period of rehabilitation and a dedicated owner usually helps nervous \\"Retired Racers\\" become more confident. A few people also report that they have known \\"Greys\\" who at first fear other dog breeds until sufficiently exposed. As the lure used to train greyhounds for racing resembles a hare, retired racers sometimes also mistake smaller dogs for a lure, causing them to set chase. Similarly, small animals including cats may also be the subject of prey-driven behavior by some greyhounds. Prior to adoption, agencies generally screen greyhounds for their suitability around small animals especially by way of \\"cat testing\\" in which a dog is carefully exposed to a cat to see his or her interest level. A greyhound puppy and cat. Some Greyhounds have a strong prey drive, having been bred to hunt and chase. For a few Greyhounds this urge can be difficult or impossible to overcome through training. Frequently, Greyhound adoption agencies require owners to keep them on-leash at all times, except in fully enclosed areas. A few agencies will also advise owners to keep their greyhounds muzzled around other dogs with which they are not familiar. While some owners disagree or ignore this advice, adoption groups like those linked here are generally very clear about this requirement. For the best interests of the breed in general they encourage owners to be cautious with Greyhounds because on the track they are trained to run, chase and bite regardless of weather or injury or individual desire, while at the same time breeders select dogs with a strong prey drive for breeding. Greyhounds have very thin skin and very short fur. They can be easily harmed by biting or scratching from other dogs or accidentally running into sharp objects. Combined with their low body fat, coats or sweaters are required when outside in cold weather. Some owners also put boots on their Greyhounds in very cold temperatures. In the home, the vast majority of greyhounds are easily trained for housebreaking. Retired racers are crate-trained and you need to teach them about Track Some people suspect Greyhounds consider the house to be an extension of their crate, and thus will not voluntarily urinate or defecate indoors except in exigent circumstances, such as severe intestinal upset. Greyhounds enjoy resting on beds and sofas, often sleeping or dozing 16 hours a day or more. They often \\"dig up\\" their bedding materials like blankets to create a pile that can cushion their deep rib cage, which can make it difficult for them to get comfortable. Particularly common in sleeping among Greyhounds is the so-called \\"roach\\" or \\"cockroach\\" sleeping position, in which a Greyhound will roll onto his/her back and spread his/her legs at odd angles in all directions, in a position reminiscent of deceased cockroaches who are often found on their backs. Greyhound adopter and public education events are found wherever ex- racers are re-homed. Some are small local gatherings hosted by adoption groups; others are regional events drawing participants (dog and human) from great distances. It is common to find Greyhound outreach at local pet stores and other public events in which members of the community can see \\"retired racers\\" and speak to adoption group volunteers. The largest event for retired Greyhound owners is the Greyhounds Reach the Beach, which takes place in Dewey Beach, Delaware in the United States. Two to four thousand dogs and their human escorts generally attend this event.

It resulted in the Christianization of the royal house of Iberia, with the consequent Christianization of Iberia. According to most widely traditional accounts, she belonged to a Greek-speaking Roman family from Kolastra, Cappadocia, was a relative of Saint George,Orthodox Church of America - and came to Georgia (ancient Iberia) from Constantinople. Other sources claim she was from Rome, Jerusalem or Gaul (modern France). According to legend, she performed miraculous healings and converted the Georgian queen, Nana, and eventually the pagan king Mirian III of Iberia, who, lost in darkness and blinded on a hunting trip, found his way only after he prayed to \\"Nino‚Äôs God\\". Mirian declared Christianity the official religion (c. 327) and Nino continued her missionary activities among Georgians until her death. Her tomb is still shown at the Bodbe Monastery in Kakheti, eastern Georgia. St. Nino has become one of the most venerated saints of the Georgian Orthodox Church and her attribute, a grapevine cross, is a symbol of Georgian Christianity. Early life Many sources agree that Nino was born in the small town of Colastri, in the Roman province of Cappadocia, although a smaller number of sources disagree with this. On her family and origin, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have different traditions. According to the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, she was the only child of a famous family. Her father was Roman general Zabulon and her mother Sosana (Susan). On her father's side, Nino was related to St. George, and on her mother's, to the patriarch of Jerusalem, Houbnal I. During her childhood, Nino was brought up by the nun Niofora-Sarah of Bethlehem. Nino‚Äôs uncle, who was the patriarch of Jerusalem, oversaw her traditional upbringing. Nino went to Rome with the help of her uncle where she decided to preach the Christian gospel in Iberia, known to her as the resting place of Christ‚Äôs tunic. According to the legend, Nino received a vision where the Virgin Mary gave her a grapevine cross and said: :\\"Go to Iberia and tell there the Good Tidings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and you will find favour before the Lord; and I will be for you a shield against all visible and invisible enemies. By the strength of this cross, you will erect in that land the saving banner of faith in My beloved Son and Lord.\\" Saint Nino entered the Iberian Kingdom in Caucasus from the Kingdom of Armenia, where she escaped persecution at the hands of the Armenian King Tiridates III. She had belonged to a community of virgins numbering 35, along with martyr Hripsime, under the leadership of St. Gayane, who preached Christianity in the Armenian Kingdom. They were all, with the exception of Nino, tortured and beheaded by Tiridates. All 35 of the virgins were soon canonised by the Armenian Apostolic Church, including Nino (as St. Nune). Contrasting with this, the Roman Catholic tradition, as narrated by Rufinus of Aquileia, says Nino was brought to Iberia not by her own will, but as a slave, and that her family tree is obscure.Rufinus 1997 = The Church History of Rufinus of Aquileia, Books X and XI, transl. by Philip R. Amidon, New-York ‚Äì Oxford. St Nino in Iberia Saint Nino with her scroll and grapevine cross Nino reached the borders of the ancient Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the south about 320. There she placed a Christian cross in the small town of Akhalkalaki and started preaching the Christian faith in Urbnisi, finally reaching Mtskheta (the capital of Iberia). The Iberian Kingdom had been influenced by the neighbouring Persian Empire which played an important role as the regional power in the Caucasus. The Iberian King Mirian III and his nation worshiped the syncretic gods Armazi and Zaden. Soon after the arrival of Nino in Mtskheta, Nana, the Queen of Iberia requested an audience with the Cappadocian. Queen Nana, who suffered from a severe illness, had some knowledge of Christianity but had not yet converted to it. Nino, restoring the Queen's health, won to herself disciples from the Queen's attendants, including a Jewish priest and his daughter, Abiathar and Sidonia. Nana also officially converted to Christianity and was baptized by Nino herself. Mirian, aware of his wife‚Äôs religious conversion, was intolerant of her new faith, persecuting it and threatening to divorce his wife if she did not leave the faith.Isoelian, P. A Short History of the Georgian Church. Saunders, Otley, and Co., London: 1866. He secluded himself, however, from Nino and the growing Christian community in his kingdom. His isolation to Christianity did not last long because, according to the legend, while on a hunting trip, he was suddenly struck blind as total darkness emerged in the woods. In a desperate state, King Mirian uttered a prayer to the God of St Nino: :If indeed that Christ whom the Captive had preached to his Wife was God, then let Him now deliver him from this darkness, that he too might forsake all other gods to worship Him.Tyrannius Rufinus, Historia Ecclesiastica As soon as he finished his prayer, light appeared and the king hastily returned to his palace in Mtskheta. As a result of this miracle, the King of Iberia renounced idolatry under the teaching of St Nino and was baptized as the first Christian King of Iberia. Soon, the whole of his household and the inhabitants of Mtskheta adopted Christianity. In 326 King Mirian made Christianity the state religion of his kingdom, making Iberia the second Christian state after Armenia. After adopting Christianity, Mirian sent an ambassador to Byzantium, asking Emperor Constantine I to have a bishop and priests sent to Iberia. Constantine, having learned of Iberia‚Äôs conversion to Christianity, granted Mirian the new church land in JerusalemTheodore Downling, Sketches of Georgian Church History, p. 52 and sent a delegation of bishops to the court of the Georgian King. Roman historian Tyrannius Rufinus in Historia Ecclesiastica writes about Mirian's request to Constantine: :After the church had been built with due magnificence, the people were zealously yearning for God's faith. So an embassy is sent on behalf of the entire nation to the Emperor Constantine, in accordance with the captive woman's advice. The foregoing events are related to him, and a petition submitted, requesting that priests be sent to complete the work which God had begun. Sending them on their way amidst rejoicing and ceremony, the Emperor was far more glad at this news than if he had annexed to the Roman Empire peoples and realms unknown.Marjory and Oliver Wardrop, The Life of Saint Nino, volume 5, Clarendon Press Series In 334, Mirian commissioned the building of the first Christian church in Iberia which was finally completed in 379 on the spot where now stands the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta. A mosaic in Samtavro Monastery, Mtskheta Nino, having witnessed the conversion of Iberia to Christianity, withdrew to the mountain pass in Bodbe, Kakheti. St Nino died soon after; immediately after her death, King Mirian commenced with the building of monastery in Bodbe, where her tomb can still be seen in the churchyard. Nino and its variants remains the most popular name for women and girls in the Republic of Georgia. There are currently 88,441 women over age 16 by that name residing in the country, according to the Georgia Ministry of Justice. It also continues to be a popular name for baby girls.Nino is the most popular name for girls in Georgia The Georgian name \\"Nino\\" is \\"Nune\\" or \\"Nuneh\\" in Armenian, thus St. Nino is known as St. Nune in Armenia. Her history as the only one of the 35 nuns of the company of Sts. Gayane and Hripsime to escape the slaughter at the hands of the pagan Armenian King Tiradates III in 301 is recounted in the book \\"The History of the Armenians\\" by Movses Khorenatzi (Moses of Khoren), which was written about the year 440. Legacy The Phoka Nunnery of St. Nino was established in rural Georgia by Abbess Elizabeth and two novices. They originally lived in a nearby house owned by Georgian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Ilia II, then in 1992 moved to the site of an 11th century church to restore it. The nunnery population in 2010 had grown to six nuns and one novice and the restoration had been completed. Along with their devotional life, the resident nuns are all artisans. Some working in enamel and mosaic crafts, others in making cheese, honey, chocolate, and jams. They integrate their skills with the local folk customs of cheesemaking and also produce textiles in the traditional Javakhetian style. The nuns also run a school for local children, mostly Armenians. The Sacred Monastery of Saint Nina is the home of a monastic community of Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Christian nuns in the Patriarchate of Georgia's North American Diocese. It is located in Union Bridge, Maryland, USA, and was established in September 2012.Sacred Monastery of Saint Nina in Union Bridge, Maryland See also * Georgian Orthodox Church * Saint Nino, patron saint archive Notes Further reading  External links * Biography from The St. Nina Quarterly * Life of St Nino * St. Nino church opening event in NYC * The Church of St. Nina, Kandalaksha, Murmansk oblast, Russia.

History  Old Partido Progressista logo. Founded in 1995, as Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB), by the union of: *the Reform Progressive Party, founded in 1993 by Democratic Social Party and Christian Democratic Party; *the Progressive Party, founded in 1993 by the Social Labour Party and the Reform Labour Party. The party entered in coalition with the Brazilian Social Democracy Party and the Liberal Front Party, supporting President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 2003 the party re- changed its name to the Progressive Party. PP has also supported the Workers' Party-led government since 2003. At the parliamentary elections, held in October 2006, the party won 42 of the 513 seats in the chamber of deputies, and it has 1 of the 81 seats in the Senate. At the 2010 elections, PP won 41 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and made gains in the Senate for a total of 5 seats. It lost an extremely close gubernatorial runoff in Roraima to the PSDB, and won no state governorships. Its most well-known politicians are Jair Bolsonaro, current president of Brazil; Paulo Maluf, mayor and governor of S√£o Paulo for several terms; Esperidi√£o Amin, former governor of Santa Catarina and senator; and Francisco Dornelles, former minister of Labour and senator for the state of Rio de Janeiro. The party has from its very beginning shown a tendency for regional division, with the section from Rio Grande do Sul state often threatening with secession, in part due to what is viewed by them as condescendence of the party's national direction towards members involved in corruption scandals, including Paulo Maluf (who has recently been discharged from his post as de facto leader of PP). The national orientation of the party has been one of close alliance with Lula's Workers' Party government (except on issues sensitive to the right wing core of PP, such as taxes), while the section of Rio Grande do Sul once more show a defiant stance in aligning itself more often with the opposition. The Progressive Party supported the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. This party was most affected by the Petrobras corruption scandal.

Originally serialized in Bessatsu Friend from 1999 until 2002, the individual chapters have been collected and published in ten tank≈çbon volumes by Kodansha. The series focuses on Kyo Aizawa, a girl forced by her father to live as a boy so she can be on her new school's boys' top-ranked basketball team. It is licensed for an English language release in North America by Tokyopop, which completed releasing the series in August 2005. Characters * ‚Äì a high school girl who wants a cute boyfriend and to wear the lovely Seisyu High School girl's uniform. Unfortunately, ever since her father tore his Achilles tendon, he hoped and planned for her to fulfill his dream of being a basketball star. Grudgingly, she attends Seisyu as a boy and proves to be an invaluable member of the boys' basketball team though she is also the shortest member. She is very popular with the girls at Seisyu, who think she's a boy. Despite her desire to be feminine, Kyo has a very masculine way of interacting with people. Whether this is her nature or the effect of sharing a dormitory with boys is unclear. * ‚Äì one of the best players in the boys' basketball team, and one of the most popular guys at Seisyu. He and Kyo are roommates and the two initially get off to a bad start, but gradually learn to get along relatively well and he eventually develops a crush on her. Chiharu is the first of Kyo's friends to learn that she is a girl and immediately begins to help her cover up her secret, despite not understanding why. Despite his popularity with girls, Chiharu is more interested in basketball than girls, a practice that lost him his first girlfriend. He is very irritable and seems always annoyed at something, which partially due to his loving Kyo and being unwilling to admit it. Despite that he has a good heart underneath. Kyo is very good at \\"pushing his buttons\\". * ‚Äì a fellow member of the basketball team and Kyo's faithful companion. Hamaya is mostly after girls and is the least popular player in the team. Though hopeless with most girls, he eventually gets a girlfriend, Emiri Kozono, until she moves to Germany. He is the biggest comic relief and is prone to inexplicably losing all of his clothes (including his underwear). He is extremely perverted and keeps a large stash of pornographic videos and magazines. As a member of the basketball team, Hamaya is frequently Kyo's \\"stepladder\\" for her slam dunks. * ‚Äì the captain of Seisyu's boys' basketball team. He has a room to himself (which he frequently shares with Chiharu when he and Kyo argue) and is very popular. Imai is a very good friend of Chiharu's and a friendly upbeat person, willing to help his friends should they call upon him. In volume 9, he and the rest of the boys' basketball team (except Chiharu and Kensuke, who were keeping this secret) discover that Kyo is a girl. When Kyo challenges the basketball team to get her position back, Imai is the only one who is able to stop her, giving merit to his position as the basketball team captain. * ‚Äì Kyo's longtime friend who enrolled in Seisyu in order to play basketball with Kyo and became the captain of the girls' basketball team. Tsuyaka is prone to a frightening attitude and does not look like a teenage student, standing around six feet tall. She is very determined, very ruthless, and can be somewhat selfish and insensitive to others. For part of the series, Hamaya expresses a profound interest in her. She exposes Kyo's secret to Chiharu after losing a game to him in hopes of forcing Kyo to join the girls' team. Tsuyaka is persistent and insistent that Kyo openly becomes a girl again so that she may play on Seisyu's girls' basketball team, and will not hesitate to use underhanded means if necessary. * ‚Äì a high-ranking basketball player and a genius due to his photographic memory, Kensuke lives a hard life despite being bright and an excellent basketball player. He does not live in the dormitory with the other students. He has a crush on Kyo, and because of this, he re-joins the boys' basketball team just to be with her. He suspects Kyo is a girl when he first meets her and she later confirms it. Kensuke displays extreme emotional distress and even goes as far as to attempt suicide by burning down a building with Kyo and himself trapped inside. However, Chiharu saves them both and Kensuke is gradually able to accept Kyo's friendship and finds various ways to try and bring her together with Chiharu. * ‚Äì the boys' team manager and has a major crush on Kyo; she thinks Kyo is actually a boy, even when Kyo comes to school dressed as a girl, probably due to denial. Not surprisingly, her crush is unrequited, and Akari eventually stops trying to get close to Kyo when she mistakenly believes that Kyo (as a boy) is attracted to boys. She is very energetic and aggressive (to the point where she is credited with being Kyo's first kiss), and proficient with many forms of weaponry, which she can suddenly pull from thin-air. * ‚Äì Kyo's father, a talented basketball player until his Achilles' tendon tore. With his dreams of joining the NBA shot down, he passed down his love of the game to Kyo, who enjoyed playing basketball because it meant spending time with her dad. He dreams for Kyo to play in the NBA (NBA or WNBA, unknown) - and ultimately made the decision to enroll her in Seisyu as a boy. * ‚Äì the dorm manager of the boys' dormitory at Seisyu High. She was previously a basketball player capable enough to keep up with most boys, but an injury ended her aspirations, much like Kyo's father. Notably, she does not appear beyond the first volume, which is something characters poke fun at during the series. * ‚Äì the coach of the boys' basketball team, who is as moody and irritable as the teenagers he works with.

In 981 Belz was incorporated into Kievan Rus'.Artur Paw≈Çowski, Roztocze, Oficyna Wydawnicza \\"Rewasz\\", Warszawa 2009. In 1170 the town became the seat of a duchy. In 1234 it was incorporated into the Duchy of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, which would control Belz until 1340 when it came under Lithuanian rule. Belz was under Polish rule from 1366 to 1772, first as a fief, and since 1462 as the capital of a voivodeship. On October 5, 1377 the town was granted rights under the Magdeburg law by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk, the governor of Red Ruthenia. A charter dated November 10, 1509 once again granted Belz privileges under the Magdeburg rights. In 1772, Belz was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire (later Austrian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire) where it was a part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Belz received a railway connection in 1884 with the opening of the railway line Jaros≈Çaw‚ÄìKowel.  Modern history  With the collapse of Austria-Hungary following World War I in November 1918, Belz was included in the Western Ukrainian People's Republic. It came under Polish control in 1919 during the Polish-Ukrainian War. In April 1920, the Second Polish Republic, represented by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, and the Ukrainian People's Republic, represented by Symon Petlura signed the Treaty of Warsaw, in which they agreed that the Polish- Ukrainian border in Western Ukraine would follow the Zbruch River. This left Belz, along with the rest of Eastern Galicia in the Polish Republic.Richard K Debo, Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918‚Äì1921, pp. 210-211, McGill-Queen's Press, 1992, . From 1919 to 1939 Belz was annexed to the Lviv Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. From 1939 to 1944 Belz was occupied by Germany as a part of the General Government. Belz is situated on left, north waterside of the Solokiya river (affluent of the Bug river), which was the German-Soviet border in 1939‚Äì1941. After the war Belz reverted to Poland (where it was again within the Lublin Voivodeship) until 1951 when, after a border readjustment, it passed to the Soviet Union (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). (See: 1951 Polish‚ÄìSoviet territorial exchange) Since 1991 it has been part of independent Ukraine.  Jewish history  The Ashkenazi Jewish community in Belz was established circa 14th century. In 1665, the Jews in Belz received equal rights and duties.Dr Fryderyk Pap√©e, Zabytki przesz≈Ço≈õci miasta Be≈Çza. Lw√≥w 1884 The town became home to a Hasidic dynasty in the early 19th century. At that time, the Rav of Belz, Rabbi Shalom Rokeach (1779‚Äì1855), also known as the Sar Shalom, joined the Hasidic movement by studying with the Maggid of Lutzk,Preface to the Divras Shlomo signed by the Belzer Rebbe, 1997 and established the community and become the first Belzer Rebbe from 1817 to 1855. Belz hasidic synagogue, the synagogue in Belz, dedicated in 1843, destroyed by the Nazis during World War II, and demolished in the 1950s. Rebbe (term for hassidic Rabbi) Shalom Rokeach personally helped build the city's large and imposing synagogue, dedicated in 1843. When Rebbe Shalom died in 1855, his youngest son, Rebbe Yehoshua Rokeach (1855‚Äì1894), became the next Rebbe. Belzer Hasidism grew in size during Rebbe Yehoshua's tenure and the tenure of his son and successor, Rebbe Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer Rebbe)(1894‚Äì1926). Rebbe Yissachar Dov's son and successor, Rebbe Aharon Rokeach (1880 to 1957), escaped from Nazi-occupied Europe to Israel in 1944, re-establishing the Hasidut first in Tel Aviv and then in Jerusalem. The successor of Rebbe Aharon is the current Rebbe Yissacher Dov Rokeach (born December 21 1947) named after his grandfather the third Rebbe, son of Rebbi Mordechai Rokeach of Bilgoraye who was the younger brother of Rebbe Aharon, the previous Rebbe. Rabbi Mordechai Rokeach of Bilgoraye died November 1949 while his son the current Rebbe was only two years old. A few years later in 1957 Rebbe Aharon died while the only living survivur of the Belz dynasty [the current Rebbe] was only nine years old. Nine years later in 1966 Rebbe Yissacher Dov Rokeach, the current Rebbe was crowned as the fifth Belz Rebbe. Under his leadership the Belz hasidus grew to become one of today's greatest hasidic empires with around fifteen thousand followers around the globe. At the beginning of World War I, Belz had 6100 inhabitants, including 3600 Jews, 1600 Ukrainians, and 900 Poles.Dr Mieczys≈Çaw Or≈Çowicz. Ilustrowany Przewodnik po Galicyi. Lw√≥w 1919. During the German and Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939), most of the Jews of Belz fled to the Soviet Union in Autumn 1939 (the German‚ÄìSoviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation). However, by May 1942, there were over 1,540 local Jewish residents and refugees in Belz. On June 2, 1942, 1,000 Jews were deported to Hrubiesz√≥w and from there to Sobibor extermination camp. Another 504 were brought to Hrubiesz√≥w in September of that year, after they were no longer needed to work on the farms in the area.Spector, Shmuel and Wigoder, Geoffrey, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust, p. 105. NY:NYU Press 2001.  Cultural trivia  The Yiddish song ‚ÄúBeltz, Mayn Shtetele‚Äù is a moving evocation of a happy childhood spent in a shtetl. Originally this song was composed for a town which bears a similar- sounding name in Yiddish (belts), called BƒÉl»õi in Moldovan/Romanian, and is located in Bessarabia (presently the Moldova Republic). Later interpretations may have had Belz in mind, though. The song has special significance in Holocaust history, as a 16-year-old playing the song was overheard by an SS guard at Auschwitz extermination camp, who then forced the child to play it repeatedly to ease the moods of Jews being herded into the gas chambers.BBC Magazine Belz is also a very important place for Ukrainian Catholics and Polish Catholics as a place where the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa (this icon was believed to have painted by St. Luke the Evangelist) had resided for several centuries until 1382, when W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk, duke of Opole, took the icon home to his principality after ending his service as the Royal emissary for Halychyna for Louis I of Hungary.The Black Madonna Literature ‚Äì Belles- lettres: a poem Maria: A Tale of the Ukraine written by Antoni Malczewski, and a novel Staro≈õcina Be≈Çska: opowiadanie historyczne 1770‚Äì1774 by J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski.

The Iowa Events Center is a public events complex located in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, United States. History Gov. Tom Vilsack speaks at the Wells Fargo Arena dedication ceremony on July 12, 2005. The Iowa Events Center consists of the existing Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center, the existing Polk County Convention Complex, the new Hy-Vee Hall, and the new Wells Fargo Arena. The new buildings were designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport Venue Event), who were also the architects of the renovated Principal Park in Des Moines, the United Center in Chicago, and many other arenas and stadiums in the United States. The project cost $217 million, making this the largest public project in Iowa history. Funding for the project came from Polk County and its cities, private donations, and the Vision Iowa Fund that Gov. Tom Vilsack signed into law in 2000. Gambling profits from the Prairie Meadows casino in nearby Altoona are expected to pay off the debt. Construction began in early 2002 after Polk County reached a project-labor agreement with local labor unions that guaranteed favorable wages and working conditions in exchange for no work stoppages. Polk County was soon sued by right to work supporters who claimed that the use of a project-labor agreement on a public project violated Iowa's right to work laws. The lawsuit halted construction for several months, but on November 14, 2002, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in Polk County's favor. On April 22, 2004, Polk County agreed to transfer management of the Iowa Events Center to Global Spectrum, a Comcast subsidiary, of Philadelphia. Global Spectrum soon announced that the new Iowa Stars hockey team would be the center's primary tenant. In September 2004, Global Spectrum announced that ticket purchases will be done through Patron Solutions, another Comcast subsidiary, instead of Ticketmaster. Venues Current Wells Fargo Arena Wells Fargo Arena Named for title sponsor Wells Fargo Financial Services, Wells Fargo Arena has been the Des Moines area's primary venue for sporting events and concerts since it opened on July 12, 2005. The state high school wrestling and basketball tournaments have been held there since 2006. In fall 2007, it became home to the Iowa Energy (later named Iowa Wolves) of the NBA D-League/G League. The following spring, the reactivated Iowa Barnstormers arena football began playing at the Wells Fargo Arena. Wells Fargo Arena seats 15,181 for hockey games, 16,110 for basketball games, and as many as 16,980 for concerts. Hy-Vee Hall Hy-Vee Hall Hy-Vee Hall, which the Hy-Vee supermarket chain (based in West Des Moines) owns the naming rights to, is the Iowa Events Center's new exhibition hall. It features 100,000 square feet (9,000 m¬≤) of space for trade shows, conventions, and other major events. It also features eight meeting rooms with a total of 15,000 square feet (1,400 m¬≤) of meeting space. The south end of Hy-Vee Hall houses the Iowa Hall of Pride, which honors the achievements of Iowa high school athletes and performers. Although it was still incomplete, Hy-Vee Hall hosted its first event, the Autumn Festival, from October 21 through October 23, 2004. It was formally dedicated on December 15, 2004, while the Iowa Hall of Pride opened to the public on February 23, 2005.

Threadfin was laid down on 18 March 1944 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 26 June 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Frank G. Fox, and commissioned on 30 August 1944 with Commander John J. Foote in command. Training and trials out of Portsmouth followed her final completion late in September. After transiting the Panama Canal in mid-November, the submarine reached Pearl Harbor early in December and conducted intensive training in preparation for her first war patrol.  First war patrol  Threadfin stood out of Pearl Harbor on 25 December. Early in January 1945, she reached her assigned patrol area in the waters just south of Ky≈´sh≈´. There, she spent 30 of her 54 days at sea. She encountered numerous enemy aircraft, patrol craft, and fishing vessels, but only six targets worthy of a torpedo. On 30 January, Threadfin sighted a large enemy patrol craft, but prudently allowed her to pass unmolested in the hope of drawing a bead on any merchant vessels for which she might be running interference. Presently, a 2000-ton coastal freighter escorted by two patrol vessels and a plane crossed her path. Threadfin fired a spread of six torpedoes from a range of about . At least one of them struck home, obscuring the target in smoke and steam. The cargoman probably sank; but Threadfin could not verify that result visually because the escorts drove her deep with a persistent, though ineffective, depth charge attack. Two days later, the submarine encountered a Japanese . However, the enemy's course changes kept Threadfin from gaining an advantageous attack setup, and the Japanese \\"pig-boat\\" disappeared in the distance. Threadfin next happened upon two freighters escorted by three patrol craft. This time, the small convoy's position close inshore defied the American submarine's efforts to attack. The following day, she mistook another patrol vessel for a cargo ship and discovered her mistake in just enough time to make a deep dive to safety. That escapade also robbed her of a chance at a small convoy consisting of two small cargomen and two escorts. She sighted the convoy later when she returned to periscope depth; but, by then the ships had passed out of range. A week later, she launched six torpedoes at a minesweeper distant. In spite of an excellent fire-control solution, all six missed. They apparently ran too deeply. Three days later, she concluded a somewhat discouraging, but still successful, first war patrol at Midway Island.  Second war patrol  Following a month there for refit and training, Threadfin embarked upon her second war patrol on 14 March. She initially joined a coordinated attack group composed of herself, and submarines and . During her five-day tour with that wolf pack, Threadfin made two attacks on enemy shipping. On the afternoon of 28 March, she came across two Japanese destroyer escort-type warships and apparently dispatched one with a single hit from a spread of six torpedoes. The stricken warship's screws stopped while her colleague's depth charge attack deprived Threadfin of definite knowledge of the ultimate result. That evening, the submarine tangled with a convoy composed of two small trawlers and four luggers. During the ensuing surface gun engagement, the submarine inflicted serious damage on two of the luggers, moderate damage on the trawlers, and minor damage on the remaining pair of luggers. Though disconcerting, the Japanese return fire proved ineffectual. On 31 March, that group was dissolved, and Threadfin received orders to join and near Bungo Suido, the primary entrance to the Seto Inland Sea which separates Honsh≈´ from Ky≈´sh≈´ and Shikoku. The new attack group's primary assignment was to guard against an undetected sortie of the remainder of Japan's fleet during the Allied assault on Okinawa. On the evening of 6 April, Threadfin made radar contact with what later proved to be an enemy task force built around Japan's super battleship, . Passing up a tempting opportunity in order to carry out her prime directive, Threadfin flashed the warning to Fifth Fleet headquarters afloat off Okinawa. Completing that phase of her mission, the submarine tried desperately to regain attack position on the force, but its speed denied her a second chance. On the whole, however, her radio was probably more valuable than her torpedoes would have been. Her timely warning enabled the planes of Task Force 58 to ambush and sink Yamato and to destroy most of her consorts as well. A second mission of the submarine consisted of lifeguard duty to rescue downed American airmen. Her first war patrol afforded her no opportunity to pursue such a humane mission; but, near the end of the second she rescued a half-drowned P-51 Mustang pilot. Though he had swallowed large quantities of water, artificial respiration soon brought him around. That proved to be the last noteworthy event of the patrol; and, after a refueling stop at Midway on 30 April, Threadfin concluded her second war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 May.  Third war patrol  At Pearl Harbor, she underwent refit followed by a brief four-day training period before departing on her third and final war patrol. She stopped briefly at Guam for voyage repairs; then continued on to her assigned area in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. She closed her first victim, a three-masted schooner, to inspect her and determine her nationality. Finding her to be enemy-operated and worthy of attack, the submarine opened up with her five-inch (127 mm) deck gun. Fifteen hits later, the schooner vanished beneath the waves. Threadfin rescued nine crewmen from the schooner and learned that her victim had been bound for Dairen laden with coal. The next day, the submarine encountered a freighter sunk in shallow water and surrounded by small boats, apparently conducting some variety of salvage operations. She fired a single torpedo which caused the wreck to settle a further ten feet and which she hoped would suspend the suspected salvage operations. Closer inspection, however, indicated that the boats were fishing, not conducting salvage operations. Soon thereafter, Threadfin sighted a four-masted cargo schooner and sank her in a gun attack. The following afternoon, her deck gun accounted for another cargo schooner. On the 19th, she stopped a group of five two-masted cargo junks for inspection but allowed them to continue their voyage after identifying them as friendly Chinese. The next night, she made a surface radar torpedo attack on an enemy ship shrouded by heavy fog. She loosed a spread of five torpedoes, of which two found their mark. The target sank within five minutes without ever being visually sighted from Threadfin. The submarine concluded her offensive operations near the Strait of Tsushima. After a day of submerged patrolling without sighting a worthwhile target, she received word that night that submarine had come upon a patrol craft heading north and four small cargomen heading south. While Sea Robin took on the patrol craft, Threadfin hit the small convoy. During the ensuing night gun action, she sank two of the four tiny merchantmen and forced the other two into Sea Robin‚Äôs path. The two American submarines dispatched all four. On the return trip from her final war patrol, Threadfin rescued three survivors from a downed American flying boat and took them to Guam where she arrived on 27 July.  Post-war activities  From 27 July to 12 August, the submarine refitted at Guam in preparation for her fourth war patrol, but that patrol never occurred. While she conducted post-refit training, the Japanese capitulation ended hostilities. On 18 August, she got underway from Guam to return to the United States. She transited the Panama Canal on 16 September and reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. Six days later, she tied up at the naval base at Staten Island, New York. The balance of Threadfin‚Äôs 28-year career proved to be routine in nature. Initially, she operated out of New London, Connecticut, serving as a training platform for the officers and men learning the ropes at the Submarine School. That duty apparently lasted until December 1952, at which time the submarine was decommissioned to enter the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an extended conversion overhaul. Over the next eight months, Threadfin received extensive modifications in an effort to make her more effective in underwater operations‚Äîmore truly a submarine than simply a submersible. When she emerged from the shipyard the following summer, her hull had been streamlined and her sail modified. In addition, she lost one of her four diesel engines to make room for auxiliary equipment displaced by an expanded sonar facility. Finally, her underwater performance was boosted by the installation of two \\"greater capacity\\" batteries‚Äîthey actually produced the same power as the old style batteries but in a smaller, lighter physical plant‚Äîand a snorkel for extended submerged cruising. At the completion of her Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion, Threadfin was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 7 August 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Daniel G. Bailey in command. In October, she conducted her post-conversion shakedown cruise and, early the following month, reported for duty as a unit of Submarine Squadron 4 at Key West, Florida. Over the remaining 19 years of her career, Threadfin operated off the East Coast. She participated in several exercises each year and frequently conducted summer training cruises for United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen. Though based in Key West, she made visits to ports on the Gulf of Mexico such as New Orleans, Louisiana, and often ventured north to New London, Connecticut. In October 1962, she participated in President of the United States John F. Kennedy's quarantine of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The following summer, the submarine made what, on the basis of sparse records, appears to be her only post-war overseas deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Turkish Navy service After successive years of routine operations in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, Threadfin was placed out of commission on 18 August 1972 and transferred to Turkey that same day. She served in the Turkish Navy, on loan, as TCG Birinci ƒ∞n√∂n√º (S346) (\\"First Inonu\\") until the following summer. On 1 August 1973, her name was struck from the American Naval Vessel Register. Two weeks later, the loan expired, she was returned to the United States Navy, and sold to Turkey.Gardiner, Robert, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982, Pt I: The Western Powers (1982) Naval Institute Press, Annapolis p121 In mid-1998 she was still in active service in the Turkish Navy. She has reportedly been decommissioned since then. Honors and awards Threadfin was awarded three battle stars for World War II service.

A dyon with a zero electric charge is usually referred to as a magnetic monopole. Many grand unified theories predict the existence of both magnetic monopoles and dyons. Dyons were first proposed by Julian Schwinger in 1969 as a phenomenological alternative to quarks. He extended the Dirac quantization condition to the dyon and used the model to predict the existence of a particle with the properties of the J/œà meson prior to its discovery in 1974. The allowed charges of dyons are restricted by the Dirac quantization condition. This states in particular that their magnetic charge must be integral, and that their electric charges must all be equal modulo 1. The Witten effect, demonstrated by Edward Witten in his 1979 paper, states that the electric charges of dyons must all be equal, modulo one, to the product of their magnetic charge and the theta angle of the theory. In particular, if a theory preserves CP symmetry then the electric charges of all dyons are integers.

The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations. John Wiley & Sons. It conceptualizes the cognitive consistency motive as a drive toward psychological balance. The consistency motive is the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time. Heider proposed that \\"sentiment\\" or liking relationships are balanced if the affect valence in a system multiplies out to a positive result. In social network analysis, balance theory is the extension proposed by Frank Harary and Dorwin Cartwright. It was the framework for the discussion at a Dartmouth College symposium in September 1975.Paul W. Holland & Samuel Leinhardt (editors) (1979) Perspectives on Social Network Research, Academic Press P-O-X model Heider's P-O-X model For example: a Person (P) who likes (+) an Other (O) person will be balanced by the same valence attitude on behalf of the other. Symbolically, P (+) > O and P < (+) O results in psychological balance. This can be extended to things or objects (X) as well, thus introducing triadic relationships. If a person P likes object X but dislikes other person O, what does P feel upon learning that person O created the object X? This is symbolized as such: * P (+) > X * P (-) > O * O (+) > X Cognitive balance is achieved when there are three positive links or two negatives with one positive. Two positive links and one negative like the example above creates imbalance or cognitive dissonance. Multiplying the signs shows that the person will perceive imbalance (a negative multiplicative product) in this relationship, and will be motivated to correct the imbalance somehow. The Person can either: * Decide that O isn't so bad after all, * Decide that X isn't as great as originally thought, or * Conclude that O couldn't really have made X. Any of these will result in psychological balance, thus resolving the dilemma and satisfying the drive. (Person P could also avoid object X and other person O entirely, lessening the stress created by psychological imbalance.) To predict the outcome of a situation using Heider's balance theory, one must weigh the effects of all the potential results, and the one requiring the least amount of effort will be the likely outcome. Determining if the triad is balanced is simple math: \\\\+ + + = + ; Balanced. \\\\- + - = + ; Balanced. \\\\- + + = - ; Unbalanced. Examples Balance theory is useful in examining how celebrity endorsement affects consumers' attitudes toward products.John C. Mowen and Stephen W. Brown (1981) ,\\"On Explaining and Predicting the Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers\\", in Advances in Consumer Research Volume 08, eds. Kent B. Monroe, Advances in Consumer Research Volume 08 : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 437-441. If a person likes a celebrity and perceives (due to the endorsement) that said celebrity likes a product, said person will tend to like the product more, in order to achieve psychological balance. However, if the person already had a dislike for the product being endorsed by the celebrity, they may begin disliking the celebrity, again to achieve psychological balance. Heider's balance theory can explain why holding the same negative attitudes of others promotes closeness.Gary Chartrand (1977) Graphs as Mathematical Models, chapter 8: Graphs and Social Psychology, Prindle, Webber & Schmidt, See The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Signed graphs and social networks Frank Harary and Dorwin Cartwright looked at Heider's triads as 3-cycles in a signed graph. The sign of a path in a graph is the product of the signs of its edges. They considered cycles in a signed graph representing a social network. : A balanced signed graph has only cycles of positive signs. Harary proved that a balanced graph is polarized, that is, it decomposes into two positive subgraphs that are joined by negative edges.Frank Harary (1953) On the Notion of Balance of a Signed Graph, Michigan Mathematical Journal 2(2): 153‚Äì6 via Project Euclid In the interest of realism, a weaker property was suggested by Davis:James A. Davis (May 1967) \\"Clustering and structural balance in graphs\\", Human Relations 20:181‚Äì7 :No cycle has exactly one negative edge. Graphs with this property may decompose into more than two positive subgraphs called clusters. The property has been called the clusterability axiom.Claude Flament (1979) \\"Independent generalizations of balance\\", in Perspectives on Social Network Research Then balanced graphs are recovered by assuming the : Parsimony axiom: The subgraph of positive edges has at most two components. The significance of balance theory for social dynamics was expressed by Anatol Rapoport: :The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will tend to change in such a way that one's friends' friends will tend to become one's friends and one's enemies' enemies also one's friends, and one's enemies' friends and one's friends' enemies will tend to become one's enemies, and moreover, that these changes tend to operate even across several removes (one's friends' friends' enemies' enemies tend to become friends by an iterative process).Anatol Rapoport (1963) \\"Mathematical models of social interaction\\", in Handbook of Mathematical Psychology, v. 2, pp 493 to 580, especially 541, editors: R.A. Galanter, R.R. Lace, E. Bush, John Wiley & Sons Note that a triangle of three mutual enemies makes a clusterable graph but not a balanced one. Therefore, in a clusterable network one cannot conclude that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, although this aphorism is a fact in a balanced network. Criticism Claude FlamentClaude Flament (1963) Application of Graph Theory to Group Structure, translators Maurice Pinard, Raymond Breton, Fernand Fontaine, chapter 3: Balancing Processes, page 92, Prentice-Hall expressed a limit to balance theory imposed by reconciling weak ties with relationships of stronger force such as family bonds: :One might think that a valued algebraic graph is necessary to represent psycho-social reality, if it is to take into account the degree of intensity of interpersonal relationships. But in fact it then seems hardly possible to define the balance of a graph, not for mathematical but for psychological reasons. If the relationship AB is +3, the relationship BC is ‚Äì4, what should the AC relationship be in order that the triangle be balanced? The psychological hypotheses are wanting, or rather they are numerous and little justified. At the 1975 Dartmouth College colloquium on balance theory, Bo Anderson struck at the heart of the notion:Bo Anderson (1979) \\"Cognitive Balance Theory and Social Network Analysis: Remarks on some fundamental theoretical matters\\", pages 453 to 69 in Perspectives on Social Network Research, see page 462. :In graph theory there exists a formal balance theory that contains theorems that are analytically true. The statement that Heider's psychological balance can be represented, in its essential aspects, by a suitable interpretation of that formal balance theory should, however, be regarded as problematical. We cannot routinely identify the positive and negative lines in the formal theory with the positive and negative \\"sentiment relations\\", and identify the formal balance notion with the psychological idea of balance or structural tension. .. It is puzzling that the fine structure of the relationships between formal and psychological balance has been given scant attention by balance theorists.

Many Republican Party organizations hold Lincoln's Birthday celebrations because Lincoln was the first Republican president.

Gov. Code ¬ß 6700(c) Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, California, Missouri, and New York observe the holiday. In other states, Lincoln's birthday is not celebrated separately, as a stand-alone holiday. Instead Lincoln's Birthday is combined with a celebration of President George Washington's birthday (also in February) and celebrated either as Washington's Birthday or as Presidents' Day on the third Monday in February, concurrent with the federal holiday. History The earliest known observance of Lincoln's birthday occurred in Buffalo, New York, in either 1873 or 1874. Julius Francis (d. 1881), a Buffalo druggist, made it his life's mission to honor the slain president. He repeatedly petitioned Congress to establish Lincoln's birthday as a legal holiday.Continelli, Louise. \\"Lincoln Tribute Places Spotlight on Local Connection.\\" www.buffalonews.com, February 17, 2003 The day is marked by traditional wreath-laying ceremonies at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky, and at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The latter has been the site of a ceremony ever since the Memorial was dedicated. Since that event in 1922, observances continue to be organized by the Lincoln Birthday National Commemorative Committee and by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). A wreath is laid on behalf of the President of the United States, a custom also carried out at the grave sites of all deceased U.S. presidents on their birthdays. Lincoln's tomb is in Springfield, Illinois. On February 12, 2009, the annual wreath-laying ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial commemorated Lincoln's 200th birthday in grand fashion. An extended ceremony, organized by the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) and with help from MOLLUS, featured musical performances from four-time Grammy-nominated singer Michael Feinstein and the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The morning celebration also featured remarks by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin; Lincoln scholar and ALBC Co-Chair Harold Holzer; recently retired Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice ‚Äì and ALBC Commissioner ‚Äì Frank J. Williams; and author Nikki Giovanni reciting her newest work, which was written especially for the Bicentennial. As part of Lincoln's birthday bicentennial, the U.S. Mint released four new Lincoln cents. The commemorative coins have new designs on the reverse showing stages of his life. The first went into circulation on September 12, 2009. The standard portrait of Lincoln's head remains on the front. The new designs include a log cabin representing his birthplace, Lincoln as a young man reading while sitting on a log that he was taking a break from splitting, Lincoln as a state legislator in front of the Illinois Capitol, and the partially built dome of the U.S. Capitol.AP/The Huffington Post. \\"New Lincoln Pennies Unveiled: See Pictures Of Each Penny\\" www.huffingtonpost.com, February 12, 2009 New Jersey stopped observing the holiday on May 23, 2005 with the enactment of the Public Employee Pension and Benefits Reform Act of 2008. Origin of Black History Month Black History Month has its origin in 19th-century celebrations of Lincoln's Birthday by African-American communities in the United States.Daryl Michael Scott, \\"The Origins of Black History Month,\\" Association for the Study of African American Life and History, 2011, www.asalh.org/ By the early 20th century, black communities were annually celebrating Lincoln's birthday in conjunction with the birthday of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass on February 14. The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History announced that the second week of February would be \\"Negro History Week\\" to coincide with the traditional Black commemorations of both men's birthdays. By the 1970s, \\"Negro History Week\\" had become \\"Black History Month\\". Black History Month has expanded further to Canada, where it is also celebrated in February, and to the United Kingdom, which celebrates it in October. Official government holidays Lincoln's Birthday was never a U.S. Federal Government holiday. The third Monday in February remains only \\"Washington's Birthday\\" in federal law.5 U.S.C. ¬ß 6103(a) However, many state governments have officially renamed their Washington's Birthday state holiday as \\"Presidents' Day\\", \\"Washington and Lincoln Day\\", or other such designations which explicitly or implicitly celebrate Lincoln's birthday. Regardless of the official name and purpose, celebrations and commemorations on or about the third Monday often include honoring Lincoln. In Connecticut, Missouri and Illinois, while Washington's Birthday is a federal holiday, Lincoln's Birthday is still a state holiday, falling on February 12 regardless of the day of the week. California still lists Lincoln's Birthday as a holiday, but as of 2009 no longer gives State employees a paid holiday on February 12.

Marquis then led his team to victory over Canada in the third-place game, throwing a no-hitter. \\"Playing in front of that many people at that time in my life made me realize this is what I wanted to do with my life\\", said Marquis, \\"and I was going to work my hardest to get it.\\" As of October 2008, he was one of 31 Little League World Series players to have reached the major leagues. His bar mitzvah had a baseball theme, as his parents surprised him with a replica scoreboard, 15 or 20 feet wide by 15 feet tall, of the game line from his Little League World Series no-hitter against Canada. High school \\"When I was a freshman [in high school] I was 5' 2\\", and everyone thought I was too small to play\\", Marquis said. \\"But it was always my dream to play major league baseball, and I've always worked very hard at it.\\" As a 6' 1\\" junior and senior, however, Marquis threw a 93 miles per hour fastball, a curveball that was nearly unhittable at the high school level, and a changeup. He pitched the Tottenville High School Pirates to two consecutive New York City Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) titles. The first was a Pirates (22‚Äì1) championship in 1995 over the George Washington Trojans (32‚Äì3), 3‚Äì2 at Shea Stadium, capping a season in which he posted an 11‚Äì0 record while striking out 86 batters in 61 innings. The second championship was in 1996 when the Pirates were 33‚Äì1; again over the George Washington Trojans (41‚Äì2). He pitched his team to a 5‚Äì1, 7-inning complete game victory in which he struck out 15 batters and did not allow any earned runs, while he himself hit a two-run triple, at Yankee Stadium.Glickson, Grant, Glickson, Grant, \\"Marquis Pitches Tottenville To Its Second Straight Title, The New York Times, June 11, 1996, accessed 6/6/07 That capped a season in which he was 14‚Äì1 with a 0.40 ERA, and struck out 150 in 79 innings, while as a batter he tied a school season record with 11 home runs, drove in 45 runs, and batted .468. He received the Iron Horse Award as the top baseball player in the PSAL and The New York Daily News Player of the Year Award. Marquis was named to the All-America Second Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings. Anthony McCarron of The New York Daily News touted him as \\"perhaps the city's best high school player since ... Manny Ramirez\\", and Baseball America ranked him the 39th-highest prospect in the nation. He also played basketball at Tottenville, and on the academic side was a member of the National Honor Society. One of his classmates at Tottenville was Chicago Bears defensive end Adewale Ogunleye. Draft The right-hander originally signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Miami, which offered him a scholarship. The day of the 1996 draft, he was pitching in a high school playoff game, so his mother stayed home to wait for the phone call, and then showed up at his game in the second inning. She relayed the message that he had been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round, the 35th selection overall. Marquis was excited, and his team won the game and went on to win the city championship. He then opted out of his letter of intent, and signed with the Braves on July 18, 1996, for a reported $600,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Minor league career In 1996 Marquis began his pro career with the Danville Braves (Rookie Advanced) in the Appalachian League, going 1‚Äì1 with a 4.63 ERA in 7 games. He had 24 strikeouts and gave up 7 walks in 23 innings. The next year he tied for the South Atlantic League lead with a team-record 14 victories for the Macon Braves (which tied for the league lead), as he went 14‚Äì10 with a 4.38 ERA, tied for second in the league with 28 starts, and was named the Braves' fifth-rated prospect by Baseball America. \\"He's like a man on a mission to get to the big leagues\\", said Mark Ross, the Macon pitching coach. \\"He's doing great.\\" In 1998 he began the season as youngest pitcher in the Carolina League, but won only 2 of 22 starts for Class A Danville 97s, as he went 2‚Äì12 and struck out 135 (8th in the league) in 114.2 innings, while walking only 41. Marquis began the 1999 season at Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League, where he opened the season by firing 20.0 consecutive scoreless innings. Marquis was named Baseball America Carolina League Player of the Week for the period April 15‚Äì21, as he pitched 10.0 innings, striking out 11. He allowed only one earned run in 6 starts (3‚Äì0, 0.28 ERA) before being promoted on May 10 to the Double-A Greenville Braves, and was named the Braves' sixth-rated prospect by Baseball America. With Greenville he went 3‚Äì4, 4.58 in 12 starts. He spent much of the summer on the disabled list (DL) with a sore elbow, a tender right shoulder, and a pulled oblique stomach muscle. In 2000 Baseball America named him the Braves' fifth-rated prospect, and he split time between Double-A Greenville (going 4‚Äì2 with a 3.57 ERA), the Triple-A Richmond Braves, and Atlanta (15 games in relief; a 5.01 ERA). Marquis spent much of 2003 back in the minors, where his overall record at Richmond was 8‚Äì4, with a 3.35 ERA in 15 games (all starts). Major league career Atlanta Braves (2000‚Äì03) Marquis was called up to the majors by the Braves in June 2000, at the age of 21 the 10th-youngest player in the NL, after the Braves demoted struggling closer John Rocker for threatening a reporter. He made his debut on June 6, 2000, in relief of Tom Glavine against the Toronto Blue Jays. \\"Getting that first call and running out to the mound\\", said Marquis, \\"I promise you I didn't feel my legs at all.\\" He was later sent back down to AAA Richmond, but was recalled again in September. During the 2000 season he appeared strictly in relief, finishing 7 games in his 15 appearances, and winning 1. He became a starting pitcher in 2001, joining a celebrated staff with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Kevin Millwood. The 9/11 attack that interrupted the season also led to the death of one of his Little League World Series teammates, Michael Cammarata, a firefighter. \\"It's tough knowing that people died who were part of your life at one point\\", Marquis said. Marquis was the starting pitcher for the Braves in the first game played in New York City after 9/11. In his first year as a starter, Marquis held batters to a .145 batting average with runners in scoring position, and 2 out. The club's front office made it clear that he was off-limits in trade talks, saying: \\"He's going to be a big-time No. 1 pitcher. You don't give up an arm like that.\\" He maintained a spot on the rotation again in 2002 as the fifth starter, behind Maddux, Glavine, Millwood, and Damian Moss. In 2003, the Braves revamped their starting rotation with the acquisitions of Mike Hampton, Russ Ortiz, Shane Reynolds, and the promotion of Horacio Ram√≠rez from AA. Marquis was sent to the bullpen. He was upset about being sent to the bullpen, and requested to be sent to the minors where he could be a starting pitcher, and observed by scouts from other organizations. Ultimately, he split his season, making only 2 starts in 21 appearances for Atlanta, while starting 15 games for Richmond in AAA. On December 13, 2003, Marquis was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals along with relief pitcher Ray King and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright for outfielder J. D. Drew and catcher Eli Marrero. Looking back years later, Marquis said: \\"I was pretty young ... and I think it really shook me, to realize that nothing was forever.\\" St. Louis Cardinals (2004‚Äì06) Marquis became a full-time starter in 2004 with the Cardinals, and came under the wing of pitching coach Dave Duncan who observed that Marquis \\"always had a devastating skinner (sinker), and ... needs to get back to it more.\\" \\"It's just the pitch I had growing up, and I got away from it\\", Marquis said. He stole a base against former Atlanta Braves teammate and mentor Greg Maddux on May 3, who also stole a base in the same game. It marked the first time since June 11, 1950, when Warren Spahn of the Braves and Bob Rush of the Cubs pulled it off, that opposing pitchers stole a base in the same game. Marquis strung together a Cardinals' season-high 11-game winning streak from May 31 ‚Äì September 4, the longest by a Cards pitcher since 1985 when John Tudor also won 11 straight games. He had a shutout streak of 18‚Öì innings from August 24 ‚Äì September 10.\\"Braves-Rockies Preview,\\" The Sporting News, July 11, 2009, accessed July 18, 2009 On the business side, the Cardinals players elected him their # 2 representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association.Leach, Matthew, \\"Notes: Cards' bench comes through,\\" MLB.com, 6/15/04, accessed 8/20/09 For the season, Marquis posted a career-best 15‚Äì9 record, with a 3.71 ERA and a career-high 138 strikeouts, for the National League champions. He was 2nd in the NL in ground ball/fly ball ratio (2.17), tied for 5th in percentage of strikes that were \\"looking\\" (31%), 6th in pitches per start (104), 8th in won-lost percentage (.682), 9th in wins (15), and tied for 10th in double plays induced (21). He held batters to a .198 batting average with runners in scoring position, and a .163 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position. Marquis tossed a scoreless inning of relief in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series at Boston, and Manager Tony La Russa tabbed Marquis to start Game 4. He turned in the best performance of any Cardinals starter in the series, pitching 6 innings and giving up 3 runs. He was bested, however, by Boston pitcher Derek Lowe, who threw shutout ball for 7 innings to win the series for the Red Sox.Walker, Ben, \\"Boston 3, St. Louis 0,\\" Yahoo, October 28, 2004, accessed June 6, 2007 \\"Whether you lose 100 games or win 100 games and go to the World Series, the last day of the season you're still looking around and saying, 'The season is over?

Marquis had an up-and-down season in 2005. Although he started the season strong, he slid into a personal 7-game losing streak. It ended on August 27, 2005, when Marquis pitched a 2-hitter against the Washington Nationals, for his first career shutout. Overall Marquis posted a 13‚Äì14 record, with a 4.13 ERA in 207 innings pitched. He appeared in 33 games, starting 32, and completing 3 (6th in the NL). He gave up the second- lowest percentage of line drives in the NL (17.3%), induced 29 double plays (T-4th in the league), and was 4th with 1.26 GIDP/9 IP.Jason Marquis, FanGraphs, accessed 6/6/07 In the postseason he worked out of the bullpen in the NLCS, after not being used in the Division Series, and pitched in three games, finished with a 3.38 ERA. In January 2006, Marquis and the Cardinals agreed to a 1-year contract for $5.15 million, avoiding salary arbitration.Press Release, \\"Cardinals avoid arbitration with Marquis: Agree to terms on a one-year deal,\\" MLB.com, 1/17/06, 8/17/09 The season started off well for Marquis, as on July 23 he became the first NL pitcher to win 12 games, raising his record to 12‚Äì7.\\"Cameron puts Padres back on top,\\" The Sporting News, 7/23/06, accessed 8/21/09 But Marquis followed with a losing second half of the season. Pitching in the starting rotation all year, Marquis finished 14‚Äì16, but with a 6.02 ERA, the 2nd-worst in baseball among players who qualified for the ERA title (Joel Pi√±eiro, of the Seattle Mariners, finished last with a 6.36 ERA). He led the majors in runs allowed (136), and led the NL in losses (16) and home runs allowed (35). He also had the two worst game scores in the NL, a game against the White Sox on June 21 in which he gave up 13 earned runs in 5 innings as Tony La Russa left him in to save a weary bullpen, and one against the Braves 3 weeks later in which Marquis allowed 12 earned runs in 5 innings.Castle, George, \\"If only Marquis could bottle success,\\" NWI.com, 4/5/08, accessed 8/22/09 \\"Obviously, those were tough pills to swallow\\", Marquis said. \\"I took one for the team.\\"Muskat, Carrie, \\"Cubs finalize contract with MarquisL Veteran right-hander's three- year deal worth $21 million,\\" MLB.com, 12/19/06, accessed 8.21.98 On the other hand, in games that were late and close, he held batters to a .188 batting average. Marquis was on the Cardinals roster for their first-round playoff matchup against the San Diego Padres, but did not make an appearance in the series and was not included on the roster for either the NLCS or for the 2006 World Series, which the Cardinals won. \\"Obviously, I'm very disappointed\\", he said.Leach, Matthew, \\"Notes: Marquis roots from sidelines,\\" MLB.com, 10/13/06, accessed 8/21/09 \\"[The] year was a little bittersweet\\", he said. \\"Because you bust your butt for three years for a manager, you give it your all and don't complain, and you contribute so much in the regular season, then to have it taken away in the postseason ...

Chicago Cubs (2007‚Äì08) Chicago Cubs in 2008 In December 2006 Marquis signed a 3-year contract with the Chicago Cubs worth $21 million. With the Cubs, he wore his favorite # 21, the number formerly worn by ex-Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who coincidentally hit his 600th home run against Marquis. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.De Luca, Chris \\"Sosa's 21 a long-distance number,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, accessed June 6, 2007 On May 9, Marquis completed a three-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates, defeating them 1‚Äì0. He had a perfect game going into the 6th inning, retiring the first 16 batters he faced, but Pirates shortstop Don Kelly broke it up with a single. The game took only 2 hours and 6 minutes. Marquis struck out 5, and needed only 109 pitches to complete the game. \\"His ball was diving and darting.

Baseball and religion fall into place, and I try not to make one more important than the other.\\" Marquis did have to pitch on the holiday when he was with the Braves. It was his turn, and he did not want to throw the rotation out of order. \\"I pitched, went to temple the next morning\\", Marquis said. \\"It was a day game.

He kept batters to a .229 batting average in games that were late and close. On March 24, 2008, it was announced he would be the Cubs' fifth starter for the 2008 season. Historically, Marquis' numbers during the second half of the season were not as good as his numbers during the first half, but thanks to smart managing by Lou Piniella, Marquis and Rich Harden, newly acquired from the Oakland Athletics on July 8, rotated their starts for a time, and Marquis posted a winning month of August, going 3‚Äì1 with a 3.90 ERA. It was his second-lowest ERA after a 3.81 ERA in July. He finished the season 11‚Äì9, with a 4.53 ERA, and held batters to a .192 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position.

Marquis also upheld his reputation as a good hitter in 2012, collecting 9 hits, including 3 doubles, in 32 at-bats. The Padres re-signed Marquis in the off-season to a one-year, $3 million contract. He opened the season as the fourth starter in the rotation. Marquis started the 2013 season with a 9‚Äì5 record, including winning eight straight decisions from April 28 to June 15. In July he suffered a complete tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and had Tommy John surgery, which ended his season. He finished with a 4.05 ERA and 72 strikeouts in his 20 starts, but was leading the league with 68 walks at the time of his injury. Philadelphia Phillies On June 3, 2014, Marquis signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was released from his contract after coming off the DL in late August. Cincinnati Reds (2015) On January 21, 2015, he signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. In March 2015, Reds manager Bryan Price announced Marquis would be in the Reds' pitching rotation. In May 2015, Marquis batted eighth in the lineup, the first Reds pitcher to bat higher than ninth since pitcher Red Lucas batted seventh for the Reds on September 7, 1933. He was 3‚Äì4 with a 6.46 ERA in nine starts. He was designated for assignment on June 5, 2015. Team Israel When there was talk in the off-season about an Israeli team being fielded in the World Baseball Classic, Marquis said if it came about he would definitely be interested in playing to represent his heritage. In September 2012 Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier due to being active on a major league team. Israel was unable to qualify for the tournament, making it so Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel. Marquis pitched in the qualifying round for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier. During the opening game of the qualifiers Marquis started and threw 41 pitches over 3 innings, while giving up 2 hits and 1 earned run, while recording a strikeout and a walk.Great Britain vs Israel 9/22/16 Under World Baseball Classic rules any pitcher who throws over 50 pitches cannot pitch again for four days, therefore by pulling Marquis before reaching this limit, enabled Israel to utilize Marquis again in the tournament. Marquis again started for the final game of the qualifier and threw 43 pitches over four perfect innings, while recording 5 strikeouts.Great Britain vs Israel 9/25/16 Following his four perfect innings, Marquis said: \\"I try to approach every opportunity I get with as much passion as I can, it was definitely our goal to win this qualifier and get to the main event.\\"\\"WBC: Love the game in any language\\" Marquis once again pitched for Israel at the World Baseball Classic, during the main tournament in March 2017.\\"Israel brings MLB experience to 1st WBC main draw\\", mlb.com.

He throws it harder than most pitchers, gets plenty of movement on the pitch, and throws it down in the strike zone as he tries to induce hitters to hit ground balls. He also relies heavily on a sharp slider. In his career with Atlanta, the Braves system steered Marquis to also throw a four-seam fastball in the mid- to high-90s, but in St. Louis he began to gravitate toward instead using a sinking two-seam fastball that he had thrown as a teenager, which he still threw in the mid-90s.Bauman, Mike, \\"Cards' rotation erasing doubts,\\" MLB.com, 9/4/04, accessed 8/19/09 In addition, he throws an excellent occasional overhand tight curve ball, and a changeup which has good action.King, Sam, \\"Atlanta Braves,\\" Sports Illustrated, 2/4/01, accessed 8/20/09Cannella, Stephen, \\"Enemy Lines,\\" Sports Illustrated, 8/20/01, accessed 6/21/09 Marquis, the 144th Jewish player in major league history, is sixth all-time in strikeouts among Jewish major leaguer pitchers and seventh in wins, trailing among others Sandy Koufax, Ken Holtzman, and Steve Stone in both categories.\\"Career Pitching Leaders through 2008,\\" Jewish Major Leaguers, accessed 7/20/09Abramowitz, Martin, \\"New Exodus: Jewish Players in '07,\\" The Jewish Telegraph Agency, 3/7/07, accessed 7/20/09 \\"Beyond the Box Score 5/27/2001,\\" Athlon Sports, 5/27/01, accessed 8/20/09 In 2009, he became the second Jewish pitcher to notch at least ten victories in six consecutive seasons, joining Koufax.\\"With the glove and the bat, Jews sparkled on the diamond,\\" New Jersey Jewish Standard, 11/16/07, accessed 11/17/07 Hitting and baserunning Marquis is an excellent hitter for his position.

In New Zealand's Crimes Act, colour of right \\"means an honest belief that an act is justifiable...\\". Using this as a defence does not automatically guarantee an acquittal; however, it does diminish the mens rea component needed for a conviction. Example: Bram's friend lets him use his van to go to a party later that night. Neither Bram nor the van return the next day. Bram comes back five days later after using the van to go on a camping trip. Bram goes to court for theft. He argues that he thought that he had the right to use the van for the camping trip because he was allowed to use the van to go the party. The concept can also refer to a right, authority or power conferred on an official by way of a relationship between various statutory or regulatory instruments, where the official is granted a position's powers without having to actually occupy the position. Example: In New Zealand the law grants a Fire Police officer, when on duty, all the power and authority and responsibility of, a constable. The traffic regulations deny the use of flashing blue lights to any except police officers, and allow vehicles involved in fire service operations to deploy red flashing lights. However, by colour of right, a member of a Fire Police unit would have a legal defence if charged with unlawful use of a blue light through of s33 of the Fire Service Act 1975. As a practical matter New Zealand Fire Service policy says that Fire Police are not to use blue beacons, but such a policy carries no significance in relation to criminal law.

It is intimately connected to the uniform spanning tree, a model for a random tree. See also random walk for more general treatment of this topic. Definition Assume G is some graph and \\\\gamma is some path of length n on G. In other words, \\\\gamma(1),\\\\dots,\\\\gamma(n) are vertices of G such that \\\\gamma(i) and \\\\gamma(i+1) are connected by an edge. Then the loop erasure of \\\\gamma is a new simple path created by erasing all the loops of \\\\gamma in chronological order. Formally, we define indices i_j inductively using :i_1 = 1\\\\, :i_{j+1}=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{i:\\\\gamma(i)=\\\\gamma(i_j)\\\\\\\\}+1\\\\, where \\"max\\" here means up to the length of the path \\\\gamma. The induction stops when for some i_j we have \\\\gamma(i_j)=\\\\gamma(n). Assume this happens at J i.e. i_J is the last i_j. Then the loop erasure of \\\\gamma, denoted by \\\\mathrm{LE}(\\\\gamma) is a simple path of length J defined by :\\\\mathrm{LE}(\\\\gamma)(j)=\\\\gamma(i_j).\\\\, Now let G be some graph, let v be a vertex of G, and let R be a random walk on G starting from v. Let T be some stopping time for R. Then the loop-erased random walk until time T is LE(R([1,T])). In other words, take R from its beginning until T ‚Äî that's a (random) path ‚Äî erase all the loops in chronological order as above ‚Äî you get a random simple path. The stopping time T may be fixed, i.e. one may perform n steps and then loop-erase. However, it is usually more natural to take T to be the hitting time in some set. For example, let G be the graph Z2 and let R be a random walk starting from the point (0,0). Let T be the time when R first hits the circle of radius 100 (we mean here of course a discretized circle). LE(R) is called the loop-erased random walk starting at (0,0) and stopped at the circle. Uniform spanning tree For any graph G, a spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G containing all vertices and some of the edges, which is a tree, i.e. connected and with no cycles. A spanning tree chosen randomly from among all possible spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree. There are typically exponentially many spanning trees (too many to generate them all and then choose one randomly); instead, uniform spanning trees can be generated more efficiently by an algorithm called Wilson's algorithm which uses loop-erased random walks. The algorithm proceeds according to the following steps. First, construct a single-vertex tree T by choosing (arbitrarily) one vertex. Then, while the tree T constructed so far does not yet include all of the vertices of the graph, let v be an arbitrary vertex that is not in T, perform a loop- erased random walk from v until reaching a vertex in T, and add the resulting path to T. Repeating this process until all vertices are included produces a uniformly distributed tree, regardless of the arbitrary choices of vertices at each step. A connection in the other direction is also true. If v and w are two vertices in G then, in any spanning tree, they are connected by a unique path. Taking this path in the uniform spanning tree gives a random simple path. It turns out that the distribution of this path is identical to the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at v and stopped at w. This fact can be used to justify the correctness of Wilson's algorithm. Another corollary is that loop-erased random walk is symmetric in its start and end points. More precisely, the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at v and stopped at w is identical to the distribution of the reversal of loop-erased random walk starting at w and stopped at v. Loop- erasing a random walk and the reverse walk do not, in general, give the same result, but according to this result the distributions of the two loop-erased walks are identical. The Laplacian random walk Another representation of loop-erased random walk stems from solutions of the discrete Laplace equation. Let G again be a graph and let v and w be two vertices in G. Construct a random path from v to w inductively using the following procedure. Assume we have already defined \\\\gamma(1),...,\\\\gamma(n). Let f be a function from G to R satisfying :f(\\\\gamma(i))=0 for all i\\\\leq n and f(w)=1 :f is discretely harmonic everywhere else Where a function f on a graph is discretely harmonic at a point x if f(x) equals the average of f on the neighbors of x. With f defined choose \\\\gamma(n+1) using f at the neighbors of \\\\gamma(n) as weights. In other words, if x_1,...,x_d are these neighbors, choose x_i with probability :\\\\frac{f(x_i)}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^d f(x_j)}. Continuing this process, recalculating f at each step, with result in a random simple path from v to w; the distribution of this path is identical to that of a loop-erased random walk from v to w. An alternative view is that the distribution of a loop- erased random walk conditioned to start in some path Œ≤ is identical to the loop-erasure of a random walk conditioned not to hit Œ≤. This property is often referred to as the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (though the relation to the usual Markov property is somewhat vague). It is important to notice that while the proof of the equivalence is quite easy, models which involve dynamically changing harmonic functions or measures are typically extremely difficult to analyze. Practically nothing is known about the p-Laplacian walk or diffusion-limited aggregation. Another somewhat related model is the harmonic explorer. Finally there is another link that should be mentioned: Kirchhoff's theorem relates the number of spanning trees of a graph G to the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian. See spanning tree for details. Grids Let d be the dimension, which we will assume to be at least 2. Examine Zd i.e. all the points (a_1,...,a_d) with integer a_i. This is an infinite graph with degree 2d when you connect each point to its nearest neighbors. From now on we will consider loop-erased random walk on this graph or its subgraphs. High dimensions The easiest case to analyze is dimension 5 and above. In this case it turns out that there the intersections are only local. A calculation shows that if one takes a random walk of length n, its loop-erasure has length of the same order of magnitude, i.e. n. Scaling accordingly, it turns out that loop-erased random walk converges (in an appropriate sense) to Brownian motion as n goes to infinity. Dimension 4 is more complicated, but the general picture is still true. It turns out that the loop-erasure of a random walk of length n has approximately n/\\\\log^{1/3}n vertices, but again, after scaling (that takes into account the logarithmic factor) the loop-erased walk converges to Brownian motion. Two dimensions In two dimensions, arguments from conformal field theory and simulation results led to a number of exciting conjectures. Assume D is some simply connected domain in the plane and x is a point in D. Take the graph G to be :G:=D\\\\cap \\\\varepsilon \\\\mathbb{Z}^2, that is, a grid of side length Œµ restricted to D. Let v be the vertex of G closest to x. Examine now a loop- erased random walk starting from v and stopped when hitting the \\"boundary\\" of G, i.e. the vertices of G which correspond to the boundary of D. Then the conjectures are * As Œµ goes to zero the distribution of the path converges to some distribution on simple paths from x to the boundary of D (different from Brownian motion, of course ‚Äî in 2 dimensions paths of Brownian motion are not simple). This distribution (denote it by S_{D,x}) is called the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk. * These distributions are conformally invariant. Namely, if œÜ is a Riemann map between D and a second domain E then :\\\\phi(S_{D,x})=S_{E,\\\\phi(x)}.\\\\, *The Hausdorff dimension of these paths is 5/4 almost surely. The first attack at these conjectures came from the direction of domino tilings. Taking a spanning tree of G and adding to it its planar dual one gets a domino tiling of a special derived graph (call it H). Each vertex of H corresponds to a vertex, edge or face of G, and the edges of H show which vertex lies on which edge and which edge on which face. It turns out that taking a uniform spanning tree of G leads to a uniformly distributed random domino tiling of H. The number of domino tilings of a graph can be calculated using the determinant of special matrices, which allow to connect it to the discrete Green function which is approximately conformally invariant. These arguments allowed to show that certain measurables of loop- erased random walk are (in the limit) conformally invariant, and that the expected number of vertices in a loop-erased random walk stopped at a circle of radius r is of the order of r^{5/4}.Kenyon, R. (2000). The asymptotic determinant of the discrete Laplacian. Acta Mathematica, 185(2), 239-286. In 2002 these conjectures were resolved (positively) using Stochastic L√∂wner Evolution. Very roughly, it is a stochastic conformally invariant ordinary differential equation which allows to catch the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (and many other probabilistic processes). Three dimensions The scaling limit exists and is invariant under rotations and dilations.Kozma, Gady (2007) \\"The scaling limit of loop-erased random walk in three dimensions\\", Acta Mathematica, 199 (1), 29‚Äì152 preprint If L(r) denotes the expected number of vertices in the loop-erased random walk until it gets to a distance of r, then :cr^{1+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\leq L(r)\\\\leq Cr^{5/3}\\\\, where Œµ, c and C are some positive numbers Lawler, Gregory F.

From 1962 to 1968 he served as the Rector (i.e., chief administrator) of San Crist√≥bal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, Per√∫. Morote was born in Ayacucho into a wealthy and established family that owned land in Ayacucho, Abancay, and Cuzco, in southern Per√∫. During the 1940s and 1950s, he studied at various Peruvian universities and obtained degrees in literature, history, and law. Morote then became a specialist in the folklore of the Quechua-speaking native population of the Peruvian Andes and taught at the University of Cuzco. When the Peruvian government decided to reopen an old Catholic seminary in Ayacucho and make it into a modern university dedicated to improving the condition of the region's impoverished native population, Morote joined the new institution as professor of anthropology and vice-rector. The university began to operate in 1959. In 1962, Morote was chosen to succeed naval historian Fernando Romero Pintado as the university's leader. Following a pattern which was not uncommon among Latin American intellectuals from upper and upper-middle-class backgrounds at the time, Morote embraced first religion (becoming the pastor of an evangelical Christian church) and later Communism. At the beginning of his tenure as rector, Morote recruited Abimael Guzm√°n as a professor of philosophy at the university. Guzm√°n went on to become the leader of a terrorist group, the Shining Path, which sought to bring about a pro-Communist uprising in Per√∫ modeled after Mao Zedong's revolution in China. The Shining Path waged a 13-year-long conflict with both the Peruvian government and rival leftist militants. Osm√°n Morote Barrionuevo, one of Efra√≠n Morote's sons, became the Shining Path's second-in-command. Efra√≠n Morote's other two children also became members of the Shining Path. Some observers, such as British writer Nicholas Shakespeare (who fictionalized the capture of Abimael Guzm√°n in his novel The Dancer Upstairs), have argued that Efra√≠n Morote was probably the true intellectual leader of the Shining Path. Shakespeare described Abimael Guzm√°n as a man \\"absolutely without character\\" while he claimed that Morote was \\"incredibly intelligent and without emotion,\\" a truly \\"evil\\" man. Publicly, Morote remained until his death a respected social scientist of leftist political leanings.

In other jurisdictions, such as the United States, the profession is less clearly defined, with trademark attorneys being part of the general legal profession. In other words, they are attorneys at law who specialize in trade mark matters. In many countries, trademark attorneys have rights of audience before intellectual property courts, and benefit from attorney‚Äìclient privilege. Unless they are also members of the general legal profession, as they are in the United States, their right to appear in Court is usually limited to trademark matters. A trademark attorney frequently begins his or her career by joining a firm of trademark attorneys, or a firm of Intellectual Property attorneys with departments specializing in patent law, trademark law, and copyright law. Increasingly however, large multi-discipline law firms are establishing trademark practices. Trademark attorneys are also employed by large companies which have enough trademark interests to need an attorney just to deal with their own matters. The responsibilities of a trademark attorney include advising on the adoption and selection of new trademarks; filing and prosecuting applications to register trademarks; advising on the use and registration of trademarks; handling trademark oppositions, revocations, invalidations and assignments; carry out searches; and advising on trademark infringement matters. Trademark attorneys are often regulated as a profession, in which case they must pass a series of examinations, comply with other requirements, and observe professional ethics and standards in order to maintain formal registration (under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and Trade Marks Act 1994 in the UK, for instance). This is typically the position in Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where only qualified individuals may hold themselves out as being trade mark attorneys. In such cases the qualification is known as an exclusive or protected title. The minimum educational requirements to enter the profession in such cases are GCSE A, B or C grade in five approved subjects, and GCE 'A' level in two approved subjects, or their equivalents. Candidates with certain degrees, such as law, may be eligible for exemption in some Foundation Papers of the qualifying examination (and will usually find it easier to find a job as a trainee). There is no exclusive title in other jurisdictions such as the United States, where no specialized examinations are required in order to qualify and practice as a trademark attorney. In the United States, any attorney who is licensed to practice law in any state can represent individuals and companies in trademark matters before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This stems from the view that an attorney is capable of practicing law in any field with a minimum level of competence as shown by passing a state bar exam. In the United States, any attorney who is licensed to practice law in any state can represent individuals and companies in the United States Trademark Office.U.S. Trademark Attorney Information Many trademark attorneys have undergraduate degrees in a variety of fields such as business administration, marketing, liberal arts rather than in the science or engineering field which a Patent Attorney must have in order to practice in the United States Patent Office. Furthermore, a patent attorney must pass a special exam in order to represent individuals and companies in the Patent Office while a trademark attorney does not. In addition, the examiners who review all trademark applications filed with the Trademark Office are also licensed attorneys and their official title is Trademark Examining Attorney. They also do a trademark search of the federal trademark records to determine if the trademark applied for is confusingly similar to a registered or a prior pending application. So when one files a trademark application they will be dealing with an attorney not an office clerk. For that reason alone, it is wise for one to have a trademark attorney representing them in the prosecution of a trademark application.

She has played Lisa Fowler in the BBC soap opera EastEnders from 1998‚Äì2003 as a regular cast member, before returning for two brief stints in 2010 and 2017, and returning in 2019 as a regular again until 2020. Career Born in Reading, Berkshire, England, she took the stage name of Benjamin after her brother. Benjamin trained at the Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead. Her first acting role was as a child actress in Doctor Who in 1983, playing a younger version of the character Nyssa in Mawdryn Undead. She had one line of dialogue but remained uncredited both on-screen and in Radio Times for the role. As she is naturally blonde haired, she wore a brunette wig to match older Nyssa actress Sarah Sutton. In 1989, she starred in the children's television programme Press Gang, where she played Julie Craig. She left after the first series for another role, but returned for the fourth and final series until 1993, when her role was expanded. In 1989 and 1990, Benjamin appeared in two series of LWT sitcom Close to Home, playing Paul Nicholas' teenage daughter Kate Shepherd. Also in 1990, Benjamin appeared in the British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) Galaxy Channel soap opera Jupiter Moon. In 1995, she appeared in the Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall comedy Bottom. From 1998 to 2003, she played Lisa Fowler in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. During her time on the programme, Benjamin was involved in one of the soap's most viewed storylines, known as \\"Who Shot Phil?\\" (2001). The storyline centered on the shooting of her on-screen lover Phil Mitchell, and who, out of the many potential candidates, was responsible. Several suspects emerged and the audience was kept in the dark for many weeks as to the identity of the shooter, which was eventually revealed to be Benjamin's character. She was asked back for a short period in 2003, to help with the forthcoming exit of Steve McFadden, who was taking a hiatus from the programme. Then again on 5 August 2010, Benjamin returned to EastEnders for one episode in a storyline that was building up to the exit of Barbara Windsor. Benjamin reprised her role for a short stint in July 2017, part of on-screen daughter Louise Mitchell's (Tilly Keeper) bullying storyline. Since leaving EastEnders, Benjamin has appeared in the BBC television programme The Afternoon Play, and the BBC hospital drama Casualty. She has also appeared in pantomimes across London, as well as touring for 6 months in the play Framed in which she starred with Tom Craig from Coronation Street. In April 2006, the Daily Mirror reported that Benjamin was in talks with EastEnders about reprising the role of Lisa Fowler. Benjamin stated in an interview that all rumours of her returning to EastEnders were inaccurate and that the programme was not in contact with her. In June 2006, Benjamin appeared on The X Factor: Battle of the Stars, where she was the outright winner. She was mentored by judge Louis Walsh. She also appeared as Heather in Stephen Fry's drama Kingdom. In October 2006, Benjamin appeared in an episode of the BBC medical drama Doctors. In September 2008, she appeared in All Star Family Fortunes, winning ¬£10,000 for her charity Rosie's Rainbow Fund She starred in The Pretender Agenda at the New Players Theatre with Lee Ryan. Benjamin starred also in the UK horror film Not Alone. She was a contestant in the ITV1 series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! In 2013, Benjamin starred as Velma Von Tussle, in the UK Nationwide tour of the West End hit stage show, Hairspray. Between April and July 2017, Benjamin had a recurring role as Denise Ellisson in Casualty. On 27 May 2019, it was announced that Benjamin would be returning to EastEnders on a permanent basis. She returned on 2 September 2019. Lisa departed in January 2020. Personal life Benjamin married oil businessman Richard Taggart at Babington House, Somerset on 30 March 2006. The couple met during a flight to Dubai and became engaged three months later. Benjamin and Taggart now live in Gidea Park, Greater London.X Factor: Lucy Benjamin In the first episode of The X Factor: Battle of the Stars show on 31 May 2006, Sharon Osbourne let slip that Benjamin was pregnant. Benjamin smiled while host Kate Thornton commented: \\"I don't think you wanted that announced tonight, did you?\\". Benjamin gave birth by caesarean section to a daughter at Harold Wood Hospital in London on 22 November 2006. On 19 October 2010, she revealed that she was three-months pregnant with her second child. In April 2011, she gave birth to a second daughter. She is a patron of the charity Rosie's Rainbow Fund. In May 2015, she was awarded ¬£157,250 by Mr Justice Mann as part of a ¬£1.2 million celebrity payout during the phone hacking scandal of the Mirror Group newspapers (Trinity Mirror), under her married name Lucy Taggart.

They are registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and are affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The AIMPE represents engineers in coastal shipping, the offshore oil and gas industries, towing and dredging. They cover, in the maritime industry, employed and unemployed marine engineers, engineers or electricians on ships, people in training to be a marine engineer, officers of AIMPE, (when holding appropriate certification) power plant engineers, and (when holding appropriate certification) Charge Engineers and Assistant Charge Engineers employed in New South Wales by Caltex Refining. AIMPE also cover independent contractors who meet the criteria listed. According to the AIMPE's rules, the maritime industry is an operation on any sea going vessel. It excludes shore based operations in the maritime industry outside of shore based training. Their membership is extremely expensive for an Australian trade union (>$1500 per annum, compared with $337 for the TWU for example). The AIMPE is very concerned with the use of flags of convenience by employers as a way of avoiding occupational health and safety conditions and employment conditions. Even with the demise of the Australian maritime industry, there are now more members registered with the Institute than at any other time. This being due to the offshore industry requiring rigorously trained and certified engineering staff. Their federal president is Martin Byrne. History The AIMPE official website recognises the conflict of interest it has, that marine engineers have, \\"endeavoured to find a commonality of interest with their employers\\" in \\"a world where capitalist efficiency could lead to excesses against which workers felt it necessary to protect themselves by combining for fair wages and conditions.\\" The AIMPE has historically been divided between a professional organisation supporting the bosses (much like APESMA), while also having the anti-boss \\"Not for one but for all\\" mentality of a trade union. The AIMPE began as a craft union, using a monopoly on skill to bargain with employers. The general increase in the level of skill over the 20th century has broken this skill monopoly.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 until his death, sitting as a Liberal. The son of V√©ronique Chartrand and Ernest Gaudry, he was born in St. Laurent, Manitoba and was educated there. In 1962, he married Leona Rainville. Before entering public life, Gaudry worked as an accountant and office manager. He was the secretary-treasurer of Malcolm Construction Ltd. for twenty-five years, and was active in the community of Interlake before moving to Winnipeg in his later years. Gaudry was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1988, in the Winnipeg riding of St. Boniface. This historically francophone riding had been represented by Laurent Desjardins almost continuously since 1959; originally a Liberal, Desjardins crossed to the New Democratic Party in 1969 and was re- elected four times under that party's banner. Desjardins retired in 1988 when the Manitoba NDP was experiencing a sharp decline in popularity, and Gaudry recaptured St. Boniface for the Liberals with 61 percent of the vote of the vote. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Gaudry joined 19 other Liberals in the official opposition. Gaudry was easily elected again in the 1990 election, with only a slightly reduced plurality. His share of the popular vote fell to below 50% in the provincial election of 1995, but he was still re-elected by a nearly 2-to-1 margin over the NDP, despite the Liberals winning only two other seats in the rest of the province. The Manitoba Liberal Party experienced internal divisions in 1997, due to disgruntlement with the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield. At one stage, Kevin Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski broke from the official party caucus to sit as Independent Liberals; Gaudry was the only Liberal MLA to continue supporting the official party leadership during this period. Neil Gaudry died of a heart attack on February 18, 1999, while attending the Festival du Voyageur in St. Boniface and the legislature passed a motion of condolence in his memory on April 26 of the same year. Gaudry frequently championed francophone causes during his time in the legislature. He sought to have Louis Riel recognized as a Father of Confederation, and was an active member in l'Assemblee internationale des parlementaires de la langue francaise. Despite partisan differences, he also assisted the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon on matters relating to francophone education. Election results |Progressive Conservative |Kim F.

A typical dump truck is equipped with an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic rams to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be deposited (\\"dumped\\") on the ground behind the truck at the site of delivery. In the UK, Australia and India the term applies to off-road construction plant only, and the road vehicle is known as a tipper lorry (UK, India), tip-truck, tip-trailer, tipper truck, or tipper (Australia and New Zealand). History The Graff & Hipple Wagon Dumper, ca. 1884, showing an early lever-based dumping mechanism The dump truck is thought to have been first conceived in the farms of late 19th century western Europe. Thornycroft developed a steam dust-cart in 1896 with a tipper mechanism.\\"An Automobile Dust-Cart\\". The Automotor and Horseless Carriage Journal, October 1897, p24 The first motorized dump trucks in the United States were developed by small equipment companies such as The Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, Galion Buggy Co. and Lauth-Juergens among many others around 1910. Hydraulic dump beds were introduced by Wood Hoist Co. shortly after. Such companies flourished during World War I due to massive wartime demand. August Fruehauf had obtained military contracts for his semi-trailer, invented in 1914 and later created the partner vehicle, the semi-truck for use in World War I. After the war, Fruehauf introduced hydraulics in his trailers. They offered hydraulic lift gates, hydraulic winches and a dump trailer for sales in the early 1920s. Fruehauf became the premier supplier of dump trailers and their famed \\"bathtub dump\\" was considered to be the best by heavy haulers, road and mining construction firms.Home Front Heroes: A Biographical Dictionary of Americans During Wartime. Edited by Benjamin F. Shearer, November 30, 2006, Volume 1, pp 319, Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., Westport, Connecticut Companies like Galion Buggy Co. continued to grow after the war by manufacturing a number of express bodies and some smaller dump bodies that could be easily installed on either stock or converted (heavy-duty suspension and drivetrain) Model T chassis prior to 1920. Galion and Wood Mfg. Co. built all of the dump bodies offered by Ford on their heavy-duty AA and BB chassis during the 1930s. Galion (now Galion Godwin Truck Body Co.) is the oldest known truck body manufacturer still in operation today. The first known Canadian dump truck was developed in Saint John, New Brunswick, when Robert T. Mawhinney attached a dump box to a flatbed truck in 1920. The lifting device was a winch attached to a cable that fed over sheave (pulley) mounted on a mast behind the cab. The cable was connected to the lower front end of the wooden dump box which was attached by a pivot at the back of the truck frame. The operator turned a crank to raise and lower the box.Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions 1833-1950, Goose Lane Editions, 2001, p. 71 Types Today, virtually all dump trucks operate by hydraulics and they come in a variety of configurations each designed to accomplish a specific task in the construction material supply chain. Standard dump truck A standard dump truck is a truck chassis with a dump body mounted to the frame. The bed is raised by a vertical hydraulic ram mounted under the front of the body, or a horizontal hydraulic ram and lever arrangement between the frame rails, and the back of the bed is hinged at the back of the truck. The tailgate can be configured to swing up on top hinges (and sometimes also to fold down on lower hinges) or it can be configured in the \\"High Lift Tailgate\\" format wherein pneumatic rams lift the gate open and up above the dump body. In the United States most standard dump trucks have one front steering axle and one (4x2 4-wheeler)) or two (6x4 6-wheeler) rear axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Tandem rear axles are almost always powered, front steering axles are also sometimes powered (4x4, 6x6). Unpowered axles are sometimes used to support extra weight. Most unpowered rear axles can be raised off the ground to minimize wear when the truck is empty or lightly loaded, and are commonly called \\"lift axles\\". European Union heavy trucks often have two steering axles. Dump truck configurations are two, three and four axles. The four-axle eight wheeler has two steering axles at the front and two powered axles at the rear and is limited to gross weight in most EU countries. The largest of the standard European dump trucks is commonly called a \\"centipede\\" and has seven axles. The front axle is the steering axle, the rear two axles are powered, and the remaining four are lift axles. The shorter wheelbase of a standard dump truck often makes it more maneuverable than the higher capacity semi-trailer dump trucks.

Spielvogel.jpg|EU four-axle with two steering axles Semi trailer end dump truck 6√ó4 semi-tractor with two-axle trailer A semi end dump is a tractor-trailer combination wherein the trailer itself contains the hydraulic hoist. In the US a typical semi end dump has a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with dual tires, in the EU trailers often have 3 axles and single tires. The key advantage of a semi end dump is a large payload. A key disadvantage is that they are very unstable when raised in the dumping position limiting their use in many applications where the dumping location is uneven or off level. Transfer dump truck Example of a transfer truck and trailer A transfer dump truck is a standard dump truck pulling a separate trailer with a movable cargo container, which can also be loaded with construction aggregate, gravel, sand, asphalt, klinkers, snow, wood chips, triple mix, etc. The second aggregate container on the trailer (\\"B\\" box), is powered by an electric motor, a pneumatic motor or a hydraulic line. It rolls on small wheels, riding on rails from the trailer's frame into the empty main dump container (\\"A\\" box). This maximizes payload capacity without sacrificing the maneuverability of the standard dump truck. Transfer dump trucks are typically seen in the western United States due to the peculiar weight restrictions on highways there. Another configuration is called a triple transfer train, consisting of a \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" box. These are common on Nevada and Utah Highways, but not in California. Depending on the axle arrangement, a triple transfer can haul up to with a special permit in certain American states. , a triple transfer costs a contractor about $105 an hour, while a A/B configuration costs about $85 per hour. Transfer dump trucks typically haul between of aggregate per load, each truck is capable of 3‚Äì5 loads per day, generally speaking. Truck and pup Truck and pup dump truck A truck and pup is very similar to a transfer dump. It consists of a standard dump truck pulling a dump trailer. The pup trailer, unlike the transfer, has its own hydraulic ram and is capable of self-unloading. Superdump truck Fruehauf super dump with GMC tractor A superdump is a straight dump truck equipped with a trailing axle, a liftable, load-bearing axle rated as high as . Trailing behind the rear tandem, the trailing axle stretches the outer \\"bridge\\" measurement‚Äîthe distance between the first and last axles‚Äîto the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle configuration, Superdumps can be rated as high as . GVW and carry of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to offload, the trailing axle toggles up off the road surface on two hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed the payload, productivity, and return on investment of a conventional dump truck. The Superdump and trailing axle concept was developed by Strong Industries of Houston, Texas. Semi trailer bottom dump truck Bottom dump trailer. A semi bottom dump or belly dump is a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate in the belly of the trailer. The key advantage of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials. Double and triple trailer bottom dump truck Double and triple bottom dumps consist of a 2-axle tractor pulling one single-axle semi-trailer and an additional full trailer (or two full trailers in the case of triples). These dump trucks allow the driver to lay material in windrows without leaving the cab or stopping the truck. The main disadvantage is the difficulty in backing double and triple units. The specific type of dump truck used in any specific country is likely to be closely keyed to the weight and axle limitations of that jurisdiction. Rock, dirt and other types of materials commonly hauled in trucks of this type are quite heavy, and almost any style of truck can be easily overloaded. Because of that, this type of truck is frequently configured to take advantage of local weight limitations to maximize the cargo. For example, within the United States, the maximum weight limit is throughout the country, except for specific bridges with lower limits. Individual states, in some instances, are allowed to authorize trucks up to . Most states that do so require that the trucks be very long, to spread the weight over more distance. It is in this context that double and triple bottoms are found within the United States. Side dump truck Side Dump Industries Train Set. A side dump truck (SDT) consists of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either the left or right side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50¬∞ for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their loads further to the side of the truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer. Winter service vehicles Dump truck with snowplow Many winter service vehicles are based on dump trucks, to allow the placement of ballast to weigh the truck down or to hold sodium or calcium chloride salts for spreading on snow and ice covered surfaces. Plowing is severe service and needs heavy-duty trucks. Roll-off trucks A Roll-off has a hoist and subframe, but no body, it carries removable containers. The container is loaded on the ground, then pulled onto the back of the truck with a winch and cable. The truck goes to the dump site, after it has been dumped the empty container is taken and placed to be loaded or stored. The hoist is raised and the container slides down the subframe so the rear is on the ground. The container has rollers on the rear and can be moved forward or back until the front of it is lowered onto the ground. The containers are usually open-topped boxes used for rubble and building debris, but rubbish compactor containers are also carried. A newer hook-lift system (\\"roller container\\" in the UK) does the same job, but lifts, lowers, and dumps the container with a boom arrangement instead of a cable and hoist. File:Roll-Off.jpg|Roll-off with box container File:WLF17_BF_Dortmund.jpg|Roller container Off-highway dump trucks Off-highway dump trucks are heavy construction equipment and share little resemblance to highway dump trucks. Bigger off-highway dump trucks are used strictly off-road for mining and heavy dirt hauling jobs. There are two primary forms: rigid frame and articulating frame. The term \\"dump\\" truck is not generally used by the mining industry, or by the manufacturers that build these machines. The more appropriate U.S. term for this strictly off road vehicle is \\"haul truck\\" and the equivalent European term is \\"dumper\\". Haul truck Small 200 Ton Caterpillar Haul truck. Haul trucks are used in large surface mines and quarries. They have a rigid frame and conventional steering with drive at the rear wheel. As of late 2013, the largest ever production haul truck is the 450 metric ton BelAZ 75710, followed by the Liebherr T 282B, the Bucyrus MT6300AC and the Caterpillar 797F, which each have payload capacities of up to . Most large size haul trucks employ Diesel-electric powertrains, using the Diesel engine to drive an AC alternator or DC generator that sends electric power to electric motors at each rear wheel. The Caterpillar 797 is unique for its size, as it employs a Diesel engine to power a mechanical powertrain, typical of most road going vehicles and intermediary size haul trucks. Other major manufacturers of haul trucks include SANY, XCMG, Hitachi, Komatsu, DAC, Terex and BelAZ. Articulated hauler Articulated dump truck or dumper An articulated dumper is an all-wheel drive, off-road dump truck. It has a hinge between the cab and the dump box, but is distinct from a semi-trailer truck in that the power unit is a permanent fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via hydraulic cylinders that pivot the entire tractor in relation to the trailer, rather than rack and pinion steering on the front axle as in a conventional dump truck. By this way of steering, the trailers wheels follow the same path as the front wheels. Together with all-wheel drive and low center of gravity, it is highly adaptable to rough terrain. Major manufacturers include Volvo CE, Terex, John Deere and Caterpillar. Dangers Collisions Dump trucks are normally built for some amount of off-road or construction site driving; as the driver is protected by the chassis and height of the driver's seat, bumpers are either placed high or omitted for added ground clearance. The disadvantage is that in a collision with a standard car, the entire motor section or luggage compartment goes under the truck. Thus, the passengers in the car could be more severely injured than would be common in a collision with another car. Several countries have made rules that new trucks should have bumpers approximately above ground in order to protect other drivers. There are also rules about how long the load or construction of the truck can go beyond the rear bumper to prevent cars that rear-end the truck from going under it. Tipping Another safety consideration is the leveling of the truck before unloading. If the truck is not parked on relatively horizontal ground, the sudden change of weight and balance due to lifting of the body and dumping of the material can cause the truck to slide, or even to tip over. The live bottom trailer is an approach to eliminate this danger. Back-up accidents Because of their size and the difficulty of maintaining visual contact with on-foot workers, dump trucks can be a threat, especially when backing up.A Laborer Dies in a Street Work Zone after Being Backed Over by a Dump Truck.

It is well known as the stronghold of the 108 Stars of Destiny in the Chinese classical novel Water Margin. The modern Liangshan County is located a few kilometres to the north, and 80 kilometres west of the Beijing‚ÄìShanghai railway. The original Mount Liang was named after the Prince of Liang (), a son of Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty. After his death, the prince was buried on the mountain. The area was from prehistoric times surrounded by the largest marshland in North China, called the Daye Marsh and later the Liangshan Marsh. During the Song dynasty, the Yellow River flowed through the area. Mount Liang was located at the extreme north of what became known as the \\"eight hundred li moorage of Mount Liang\\". Because the area was largely a wasteland on the frontiers of several administrative units, government control was minimal. It is known that outlaws and bandits were active in the area during the Song dynasty, although Song Jiang ‚Äì a major character in Water Margin ‚Äì was not associated with the area. Some of the bandits on Mount Liang preyed selectively upon the rich and became known as \\"righteous bandits\\" (Áæ©Âå™; y√¨ fƒõi). Legends about the heroes of Mount Liang, which provided the basis for Water Margin, probably formed from this historical context. Banditry continued on Mount Liang until the mid-17th century, when the Qing dynasty established a military garrison in present-day Liangshan County. Water Margin describes Mount Liang in majestic terms, imagining its peak to be a plateau ringed by high mountains and protected by six passes and eight fortresses. The Yuan dynasty zaju \\"Black Whirlwind Presents Two Victories\\" () envisages Mount Liang as having \\"72 deep rivers, garrisoned with hundreds of warships. In 36 feasting towers, there is enough food for a million soldiers and their mounts.\\" When the Yellow River shifted course in 1289, the marshes around Mount Liang shrank considerably. During the Ming dynasty, it had been reduced to five smaller marshlands. After the Yellow River shifted back to its northern course in 1853, the marshes were gradually filled in by sediments carried downstream by the river and human land reclamation. Today, the relatively small Dongping Lake is what remains of the great marshes. Considerable effort has been made in recent years to develop Liangshan as a destination for tourists. A number of buildings have been erected to match descriptions given in Water Margin.

In the US, it was later marketed as the onHand PC by Matsucom. The Ruputer has a 16-bit, 3.6 MHz processor and 2 MB of non-volatile storage memory and 128 KB of RAM. Its display is a 102√ó64 pixel monochrome LCD. Its main forms of input are a tiny 8-direction joystick and 6 function buttons. It also has a serial interface and an IR port for communicating with other devices. The main body of the device (separate from the strap) is roughly 2 inches wide, 1 1/8 inches across, and 5/8 of an inch deep. It is powered by two high-powered watch batteries, which supply the device enough energy for approximately 30 hours of use. Under normal conditions, the watch goes into standby mode down when not in use in order to extend its battery life. The device was distributed with a software development kit which allows for creation of new software written in the programming language C. onHand PC The successor to the Ruputer is the onHand PC. The onHand PC was available in two color styles, clear & black, and a single format. While the Ruputer was available with either 512Kb of storage (original Ruputer), 2Mb (Ruputer PRO), or 4 Mb of flash memory (Ruputer PRO4), the onHand PC came only in a single version with 2Mb of storage. The operating system is known as W-PS-DOS version 1.16. The device features both an icon- based GUI and a text-based user interface. There is 128Kb of RAM, with an additional 128Kb of ROM. On the device, data can be entered by two methods: The first method is by using the joystick mounted to the front of the watch itself (a method that has been considered clumsy). The second method is by synchronizing data from a full-sized PC using the included software. A program called HandySurf also allows synchronizing internet content (such as Yahoo! News Headlines). Communication with other devices is either through a 38,400 bit/s serial port dock, or through the 9,600 infrared link, the transmitter of which is mounted to the upper middle of the watch. It is possible to link two onHands via this infrared link to play various two-player games. The watch uses two lithium CR2025 button cells for power, which can be accessed from the back of the device. The batteries give the user an average 3 months of usage before battery replacement. Many users have found that the CR2032 cells fit, which give the device a longer run time. The device's screen is a 102x64 STN 4-greyscale LCD which uses a timed backlight to save power. The device weighs about 52 grams (2.5 ounce), similar that of a large electronic standard watch. Considering the type of system there is a fair amount of software available although some of the programs written for the Ruputer are either entirely in Kanji script or will not run due to the increased speed of the onHand's processor. One developer has made a prototype for a docking station for the watch that includes a screen illuminator and a half-keyboard. This is not a commercial product, but instructions are available as how to create such a device. The onHand PC was discontinued by Matsucom on April 7, 2006. Response The Ruputer and onHand PC failed to achieve widespread success, for a number of reasons. First, their screen is too small to display more than a handful of text, making it awkward to view data. Second, their joystick input requires entering text in a process similar to that of entering one's initials in an arcade game high-score list. Finally, they run through their non-rechargeable batteries more swiftly than is convenient for a device meant to be worn as a timepiece, although it was later found that the slightly larger CR2032 battery can be used which gives substantially better battery life. The main competitor for the onHand PC was the Fossil Wrist PDA, a wristwatch-sized PDA. The device runs Palm OS 4.1., and like other Palm OS devices, has a virtual keyboard and touch-sensitive screen with handwriting recognition, giving the Wrist PDA an advantage over the joystick input on the onHand PC. The Wrist PDA features 8Mb of memory, four times the memory in the onHand, although a major disadvantage of the Fossil device was volatile memory - if the battery died, data was lost. The Ruputer/onHand uses non-volatile storage, which is not battery-dependent, so data is retained even through battery death.

The screenplay by Lewis Colick, based on the memoir of the same name, tells the true story of Homer H. Hickam, Jr., a coal miner's son who was inspired by the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 to take up rocketry against his father's wishes and eventually became a NASA engineer. October Sky is based on the lives of four young men who grew up in Coalwood, West Virginia. Principal photography took place in rural East Tennessee, including Oliver Springs, Harriman and Kingston in Morgan and Roane counties. The film was a moderate box office success and received very positive critical reception; it continues to be celebrated in the regions of its setting and filming. Title October Sky is an anagram of Rocket Boys, the title of the 1998 memoir upon which the film is based. It is also used in a period radio broadcast describing Sputnik 1 as it crossed the \\"October Sky\\". Homer Hickam said that \\"Universal Studios marketing people got involved and they just had to change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled Rocket Boys.\\"Homer Hickam official Web site - October Sky/Rocket Boys, The Keeper's Son The book was later re-released with the name in order to capitalize on interest in the film. Plot In October 1957, news of the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 reaches the town of Coalwood, West Virginia, where most residents work in the coal mines. As the townspeople gather outside to see the satellite orbit across the sky, Homer Hickam is inspired to build his own rockets to escape Coalwood. His family and classmates do not respond kindly, especially his father John, the mine superintendent, who wants Homer to join him in the mines. Homer teams up with math geek Quentin Wilson, who shares an interest in aerospace engineering; with the support of friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O'Dell, and their science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Freida J. Riley, the four construct small rockets. While their first launches fail, they experiment with new fuels and designs and eventually succeed. Though the local paper runs a story about the boys, they are accused of starting a wildfire with a stray rocket and are arrested. After John picks up Homer, Roy Lee is beaten by his abusive stepfather, Vernon. John intervenes and rescues Roy Lee, warning Vernon that he will protect Roy Lee as Roy Lee's late father would have. The four abandon rocketry and destroy their launch site. In a mining accident, John is injured rescuing others, and Ike Bykovsky, a mine worker who let Homer use the machine shop for rocketry and transferred underground for better pay, is killed. Homer drops out of high school to work in the mine and provide for his family while his father recovers. Later, Homer is inspired to read a book on rocket science from Miss Riley, learning to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate their missing rocket and prove it could not have caused the fire. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who determines the catalyst was a flare from a nearby airfield. Homer returns to school by special invitation; the boys return to rocketry and win the school science fair. With the opportunity for one of them to participate in the National Science Fair in Indianapolis, they elect Homer. The workers' union goes on strike against John. While the family eats dinner, Vernon shoots into the kitchen but misses John, who dismisses Homer and Jim's fears, leading to a heated argument with Homer. With the mines set to close and resenting his father's pressures, Homer storms out of the house, vowing never to return. At the fair, Homer's display is well- received, and he enjoys popularity and some sightseeing. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model ‚Äì the de Laval nozzle ‚Äì and his autographed picture of Dr. Wernher von Braun. Homer makes an urgent phone call home, and his mother, Elsie, implores John to end the ongoing strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovsky's replacement, can use the machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the town's support and replacement parts quickly sent to Indianapolis by bus, Homer wins the top prize and is bombarded with college scholarship offers. He is also congratulated by von Braun himself, not realizing his idol's identity until he has gone. Homer returns to Coalwood a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of Hodgkin's lymphoma. At the launch of their largest rocket yet ‚Äì the Miss Riley ‚Äì John, who never attended any of the launchings, is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The Miss Riley reaches an altitude of ‚Äì higher than the summit of Mount Everest. As the town looks up to the skies, John slowly puts his hand on Homer's shoulder and smiles, finally showing Homer that he is proud of him. An epilogue, using real footage, reveals the true outcomes of the main characters' lives.

Although the film takes place in West Virginia, Tennessee was the location of choice for filming in part because of the weather and area terrain. Film crews reconstructed the sites to look like the 1957 mining town setting the movie demanded. The weather of east Tennessee gave the filmmakers trouble and delayed production of the film. Cast and crew recalled the major weather shifts and tornadoes in the area during the filming months but Joe Johnston claims, \\"ultimately, the movie looks great because of it. It gave the film a much more interesting and varied look.\\" The crews also recreated a mine for the underground scenes. Johnston expressed that he felt that the looks of the mine in the film gave it an evil look, like the mine was the villain in the film. And felt it ironic because that is what gave the town its nourishment. More than 2000 extras were used in the movie. A small switching yard allowed the filmmakers and actors to film the scenes with the boys on the rail road and gave them freedom to do as they pleased, even tear apart tracks. The train used in the scene was the former Southern Railway 4501 relettered as Norfolk and Western 4501. Filming concluded on April 30, 1998. The film's star, Jake Gyllenhaal, was 17 years old during filming, the same as Homer Hickam's character. In an interview in 2014, Natalie Canerday recalled that Gyllenhaal was tutored on set because he was still in school and taking advanced classes. Release October Sky opened on February 19, 1999 in 1,495 theaters and had an opening weekend gross of $5,905,250. At its widest theater release, 1,702 theaters were showing the movie. The movie has had a total lifetime gross of $34,675,800 worldwide. Reception Critical reception The film received critical acclaim from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% out of 74 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10. The critic's consensus states: \\"Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, October Sky is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship.\\"October Sky. Rotten Tomatoes. Flixster. Retrieved July 28, 2012. Metacritic gave the film a 71 rating with these being dubbed \\"Generally Favorable Reviews\\" based on 23 professional critic reviews of the movie. Many critics tend to commend the movie for its values, family, and inspirational aspects. A lot of reviews focus on the main character's relationship with his father and on the actors' performances. Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, recognized that the film \\"doesn't simplify the father into a bad guy or a tyrant. He understandably wants his son to follow in his footsteps, and one of the best elements of the movie is in breaking free, he is respecting his father. This movie has deep values.\\" James Wall of The Christian Century describes the film's concentration on the father-son relationship as \\"at times painful to watch. There are no winners or losers when sons go their separate ways. October Sky does not illustrate good parenting; rather, it evokes the realization that since parents have only a limited vision of how to shape their children's future, the job requires a huge amount of love and a lot of divine assistance.\\" However, some reviews, such as one from Entertainment Weekly and TV Guide, claim that the movie's highlight was the acting of Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. Accolades October Sky won three awards, including: OCIC Award for Joe Johnston at the Ajijic International Film Festival 1999, the Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Family Film from the Broadcast Film Critics Association in 2000, and a Humanitas Prize 1999 for Featured Film Category. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated Differences between the film and book Although the movie was praised for its portrayal of 1950s Appalachia, it has several major and minor differences from the book on which it is based. * Homer Hickam is the main character's name; however, in the book and in real life he was nicknamed \\"Sonny\\". * Homer Hickam Jr.'s father was not named John. This was changed in an effort to keep the audience from being confused. * There were actually six \\"rocket boys\\" instead of the four in the movie. Some of the movie's representations of the characters are combinations of the real life boys. Their names were: Homer Hickam Jr., Quentin Wilson, Jimmy O'Dell Carroll, Roy Lee Cooke, Billy Rose and Sherman Siers. * The Rocket Boys did not steal railroad parts as they did in the film; however, they did attempt to grab a cast iron pipe under the tracks and, according to Homer's website, this almost got him killed * Homer never dropped out of school to work in the town's mine. He did, however, work in the mine the following summer, as described in Hickam's book Sky of Stone * Homer never met Wernher von Braun - he left the room and von Braun was gone when he came back Cultural impact There are two annual festivals in honor of the Rocket Boys and the film that are held. One is held in West Virginia where the real life events that the book and film took place, and the other is in Tennessee where the movie was actually shot. The Rocket Boys often visit the festival in West Virginia on a regular basis, and it is also called the \\"Rocket Boys Festival\\", while the festival in Tennessee focuses more on the filming locations being the relevance to the movie. The Tennessee festival's site claims that the festival is \\"a celebration of our heritage.\\" Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, saw a screening of October Sky in 1999. In a subsequent conversation with the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson, Bezos commented that he had always wanted to start a space company. Stephenson urged him to do so. Bezos then started the private aerospace manufacturing and services company Blue Origin, and Stephenson became one of the company's early employees.

It was one of the first role- playing games released for the system, and was the first in the Shining series. On August 13, 2007, the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America and on September 7, 2007 the game was re-released in Europe. The game also appears in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.Review for Xbox 360 version of Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection , IGN. Gameplay Shining in the Darkness is a \\"dungeon-crawler\\" role-playing video game. The game puts the player in control of the main character and two friends (Pyra and Milo), as they explore 3D dungeon mazes with turn-based battles. The game consists of story line interaction, dungeon exploration, random monster fights, and predetermined 'boss' fights. The combat in this game operates similarly to role-playing video games of the era such as Dragon Quest (or, more specifically, Wizardry). Additionally, the dungeon contains three characters in need of rescue. Rescuing any or all of the three is optional, and the story changes depending on whether or not the player locates and returns each of these characters to safety. Another key innovation is its icon-based menu system. This is used for battles in dungeons, equipment management, and character interactions in town. Plot Shining in the Darkness is set in the Kingdom of Thornwood. The king's daughter and the main character's father have vanished, while the evil sorcerer Dark Sol (not to be confused with his father, Shining Force villain Darksol) has appeared to threaten the kingdom. The main character is charged to find the Arms of Light, rescue the princess and his own father, and stop Dark Sol. In Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict, it was revealed Dark Sol is the son of Darksol and Mishaela, the villains of Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention. After the final defeat of Darksol, the child Dark Sol was whisked away by Oddeye, the foremost Greater Devil of Darksol's archenemy, Zeon. Therefore, Dark Sol's role in Shining in the Darkness places its entry in the timeline sometime following the events of Shining Force II. This revelation also supported by a possible reference to Darksol, when Theos mentions \\"a Dark Wizard\\" who once wielded the same Dragonbreath spell as Dark Sol. Development Sega allocated the bare minimum budget offered to out-of- house developers for the creation of Shining in the Darkness. In a 2009 interview, Hiroyuki Takahashi (credited for \\"writing\\" and producing the game) recalled: Reception Sega Pro reviewed the game in 1991 and gave it a 93% score, describing the dungeon crawler as \\"superior to all other RPGs of this style\\", praising its detailed \\"background preparation\\", detailed graphics (including scaling sprites and water effects), character conversations, sound design (especially around taverns), replayability (\\"Every game is different\\"), and its innovative icon-based menu system. Computer Gaming World compared Shining to Dungeon Master, and favorably cited the combat and animation. The magazine concluded, however, that the game was a \\"hack-and-slash adventure\\" that was superior to others on the Genesis but inferior to computer RPGs. Dragon reviewers praised the game's smooth interface and gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it \\"combines the icons and combat of Phantasy Star III, the first person perspective of Phantasy Star I, and the great close-up graphics of Phantasy Star II.\\" Mega placed the game at #28 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 Legacy Shining in the Darkness is considered by many gaming historians to be a pioneer of Japanese console RPGs, especially in Europe, which would not see a Final Fantasy game until more than six years after the Darkness made its mark in the region.Day, A (2008). \\"The History of Shining Force\\", Retro Gamer (58): 66‚Äì73. One of the game's key innovations was its introduction of an icon-based menu system, possibly inspired by fellow Sega RPG Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom (1990). The game also marked the beginning of the successful Shining series. The second game in the Shining series, Shining Force, diverged greatly in gameplay; however, many stylistic parts are reminiscent of Shining in the Darkness, including music and art. Other features such as the distinctive menu system, the use of priests for saving games and resurrecting characters, and several magic spells that would continue to be used in every game in the series up to and including Shining Force III, with the notable exception of Shining Wisdom. These games also all share story continuity, even Wisdom. A Shining game with similar gameplay, Shining the Holy Ark, was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996.

He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1993 to 1999, sitting for most of that time as a Liberal. The son of Tony Kowalski and Olga Kolczycki, he was born in Winnipeg and worked as a police officer in the Winnipeg Police Department before entering public life, serving from 1974 to 1993. He received a Canada 125th Medal in 1992, and was elected as a trustee on the Seven Oaks School Division in September of the same year. In 1976, he married Ellen Joy Michie. When Gulzar Cheema resigned as an MLA in 1993, Kowalski sought and won the Liberal nomination in the Winnipeg riding of The Maples to succeed him. He won the resulting by-election on September 21, defeating New Democrat Norma Walker by about 1500 votes. The Liberals were reduced to only three seats in the provincial election of 1995, although Kowalski was able to retain The Maples by a significant margin. The provincial Liberals went through a period of internal division in 1997. Kowalski disapproved of the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield, and left the party to sit as an Independent Liberal on June 5, 1997. He was joined by former leadership candidate Kevin Lamoureux shortly thereafter, leaving Neil Gaudry as the only official Liberal MLA in the province. Kowalski initially considered joining the NDP caucus, but declined. Both Kowalski and Lamoureux were re-integrated into the party's caucus following Hasselfield's resignation in 1998. Despite (or perhaps because of) his background as a police officer, Kowalski was a vocal supporter of gun control during his time in the legislature. In 1995, Kowalski supported mandatory supervision of sex offenders who had served their sentences, before such individuals were released to the community. Early in 1999, Kowalski refused to give unanimous consent for the legislature to discuss a motion addressing the farming crisis in southwestern Manitoba. He claimed he was acting on orders from Jon Gerrard (who had replaced Hasselfield as leader), and did not appear to be comfortable with his actions. Kowalski did not seek re-election in 1999, and has not participated in public life since that time. He stated that he intended to return to active duty with the City of Winnipeg Police Services. Kowalski retired from the Winnipeg police force in March 2004 with 31 years of service and subsequently joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

It was intended for use against US Navy aircraft carriers and carrier battle groups, with either a conventional or nuclear warhead. Development After analyzing World War II naval battles and encounters in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Soviet military thinkers concluded that the era of large seaborne battles was over, and that stand-off attacks would be the way to neutralize and incapacitate large battle groups without having to field a similar force against them. Substituting cruise missiles for air attacks, Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation commanders set about to convert their heavy bombers to raketonosets, or missile carriers, which could be launched against approaching enemy fleets from coastal or island airfields. The Kh-22 (Complex 22) weapon was developed by the Raduga design bureau and used to arm the Tupolev Tu-22M. Design The Kh-22 uses an Tumanski liquid-fuel rocket engine, fueled with TG-02 (Tonka-250) and IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid), giving it a maximum speed of Mach 4.6 and a range of up to . It can be launched in either high-altitude or low-altitude mode. In high-altitude mode, it climbs to an altitude of and makes a high-speed dive into the target, with a terminal speed of about Mach 4.6. In low-altitude mode, it climbs to and makes a shallow dive at about Mach 3.5, making the final approach at an altitude under . The missile is guided by a gyroscope-stabilized autopilot in conjunction with a radio altimeter. Soviet tests revealed that when a shaped charge warhead weighing was used in the missile, the resulting hole measured in diameter (), and was deep.Precision Guided Munitions in the Region, Technical Report APA- TR-2007-0109, 2004 - 2012 Carlo Kopp, ausairpower.net–ö–†–´–õ–ê–¢–ê–Ø –†–ê–ö–ï–¢–ê –•-22–ù \\"–ë—É—Ä—è\\", –î-2–ù, AS-4 Kitchen, –û–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü—ã –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ - –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∞, vs.milrf.ruhttp://biblioteka.mycity- military.com/biblioteka/cyber%20fulkrum/E%20N%20G%20L%20E%20S%20K%20I/AC%204%20Publication%20i%20drugo/AC_- _Tupolev_Tu-22_BLINDER___Tu-22M_BACKFIRE_Russia_s_Long_Range_Supersonic_Bombers.pdf By August 2016, Russia was finalizing the trials of the Kh-32 cruise missile, a derivative of the Kh-22.

The cruise missile version is also designed to target enemy ships, as well as radars, and \\"radio-contrast targets\\" like bridges, military bases, electric power plants, and others.

Reynolds is one of four footballers to have won three Brownlow Medals, the others being Haydn Bunton, Sr., Bob Skilton and Ian Stewart. Revered by Essendon supporters, he was often referred to simply as \\"King Richard\\".

He died on 2 September 2002. He was the brother of Tom Reynolds, the cousin of Richmond champion player and coach Max Oppy, and the grandfather of Joel Reynolds. Early life and career Reynolds in action. Reynolds grew up supporting and sold lollies outside Princes Park on match days. When Reynolds won his first Brownlow Medal in 1934, champion Haydn Bunton, Sr., whom Reynolds had narrowly beaten to win the award, was the first person to telegraph his congratulations, a sporting gesture that Reynolds deeply appreciated. In June 1947, it was announced that Reynolds would start writing about football for the now-defunct Melbourne newspaper The Argus. Like many footballers, Reynolds was also a noted cricketer. He was a successful medium-fast bowler for Essendon Cricket Club but gave up the game when it started to interfere with football. In January 1949, he made a return to district cricket when Essendon batsman Ken Meuleman was picked for State duty. After being re-elected yet again as player-coach by the Essendon committee in February 1949, Reynolds guided the Bombers to the Grand Final against , which they won by 73 points. Reynolds, who was playing his 299th game, described it afterwards as \\"the best Essendon performance he could remember.\\" Off the field, Reynolds was a shy and private man, noted for his humility about his footballing achievements.  Champions of Essendon  In 2002 an Essendon panel ranked him first in their Champions of Essendon list of the 25 greatest players ever to have played for Essendon. Just three days before his death, after being given a standing ovation by the crowd at the announcement dinner, at which he was named the greatest Essendon player of all time, Reynolds was visibly moved and stated \\"I don't deserve this honour... Bill Hutchison was the best player I ever saw.\\" Death Reynolds' funeral was held at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne on 6 September 2002. After the service the hearse made its way to Windy Hill, where Essendon fans had gathered to farewell their greatest player one last time. His family's link with Essendon continued when his grandson Joel Reynolds was selected by the club in the 2001 AFL Draft. He made his debut in Round 3, 2002 against Brisbane at the Gabba, with Dick watching from the stands.

Spruce beer can refer to either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. A number of flavors are associated with spruce-flavored beverages, ranging from floral, citrus, and fruity, to cola- like flavors to resinous and piney. This diversity in flavor likely comes from the choice of spruce species, the season in which the needles are harvested, and the manner of preparation. Using evergreen needles to create beverages originated with the Indigenous peoples of North America who used the drink as a cure for scurvy during the winter months when fresh fruits were not available, as the fresh shoots of many spruces and pines are a natural source of vitamin C. It may also have been brewed in Scandinavia prior to European contact with the Americas, but most French and British explorers were ignorant of its use as a treatment for scurvy when they arrived in North America. The First Nations people were probably first to brew it and it was used to prevent scurvy by Jacques Cartier and his explorers when they arrived in Stadacona in what is now Quebec in 1535. European sailors adopted the practice and subsequently spread it across the world.  History  North America and the Pacific  Spruce beer sellers in Jamaica, c. 1861 In 1536, the French explorer Jacques Cartier, exploring the St. Lawrence River, used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of a tree the St. Lawrence Iroquoians called the Aneda (probably Thuja occidentalis) to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams.Jacques Cartier's Second Voyage, 1535 Winter & Scurvy. Such treatments were not available aboard ship, where the disease was most common. When Samuel de Champlain arrived 72 years later, he could not ask the locals which tree should be used, as the St. Lawrence Iroquoians had disappeared. This method of treating scurvy using evergreen-needle beverages was later picked up by the British Royal Navy, and spruce was regularly added to ship- brewed beer during eighteenth century explorations of the West Coast of North America and the wider Pacific, including New Zealand. Jane Austen, who had two brothers in the Royal Navy, refers to spruce beer in Chapter 40 of Emma.Jane Austen, Emma (London, England: John Murray, 1816), vol. 3, chapter 4. From Wikisource: Harriet Smith is talking with her friend Emma about Frank Churchill: \\" ‚Ä¶ he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was about spruce beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer, ‚Ä¶ \\" \\"I do remember it,\\" cried Emma; \\"I perfectly remember it. ‚Äî Talking about spruce beer. ‚Äî Oh! yes ‚Äî Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, ‚Ä¶ \\" Alcoholic spruce beer was common in the colonial United States and eastern Canada, made from red or black spruce. A Canadian recipe from 1757 states: > It is made of the tops and branches of the spruces-tree, boiled for three > hours, then strained into casks, with a certain quantity of molasses; and, > as soon as cold, it is fit for use [...] An American recipe from the 1796 edition of American Cookery by Amelia Simmons states:Simmons, Amelia (1796). American Cookery, Hudson & Goodwin, Hartford, Connecticut. (reproduced by Project Gutenberg) > Take four ounces of hops, let them boil half an hour in one gallon of water, > strain the hop water then add sixteen gallons of warm water, two gallons of > molasses, eight ounces of essence of spruce, dissolved in one quart of > water, put it in a clean cask, then shake it well together, add half a pint > of emptins, then let it stand and work one week, if very warm weather less > time will do, when it is drawn off to bottle, add one spoonful of molasses > to every bottle. The Daily Order (11 June 1759) for the Highland Regiment in North America stipulated that: \\"Spruce beer is to be brewed for the health and conveniency of the troops which will be served at prime cost. Five quarts of molasses will be put into every barrel of Spruce Beer. Each gallon will cost nearly three coppers\\".See:  Today Sitka spruce, native to the northwest coast of North America, tends to be favored, although other species of spruce have also been used. Lighter, more citrus-like flavors are produced by using the bright green fresh spring growth before the new needles and twigs harden and become woody. Sitka spruce trees on the north-central Oregon Coast develop spring growth in early to mid-May.  Modern types  Spruce as flavoring in barley-based beer Spruce or other evergreens have sometimes been used as a flavoring ingredient in beer, such as Alba Scots Pine Ale, the Alaskan Brewing Company's Winter Ale, Beau's Brewery's Spruce Moose Pale Ale, and Yards Brewing Company's Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce. Banded Brewing in Biddeford, Maine brews a pale ale named Greenwarden every spring with Maine foraged white spruce tips. Portsmouth New Hampshire's Earth Eagle Brewings combines locally foraged pine and spruce tips in their seasonal Connie Ferale amber. Tamworth Distilling in Tamworth, New Hampshire distills a spruce gin from foraged spruce tips also. Re-creations of historic recipes Very few modern beers are actually termed \\"spruce beer\\"; those that exist are often express attempts to create a historical recipe, which may be sugar-based or barley-based. One is Wigram Brewing Company's Spruce Beer, which is based on Captain Cook's first beer brewed in New Zealand in 1773; similarly, Yards Brewing Company says its Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce Ale is based upon a recipe for spruce beer recorded by Benjamin Franklin. Spruce-flavored fermented sugar beverages Alcoholic spruce beer may also be made from sugar and flavoring from the spruce tree. Leaves, small branches, or extracted essence of spruce are boiled with sugar and fermented with yeast. Two different sources of sugar may be used, either molasses or white refined sugar. A recipe for home-brewing spruce beer of this type appeared in 1974 in Cape Breton's Magazine. Soft drinks In the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Quebec, where it is known in French as bi√®re d'√©pinette, spruce beer may refer to either an artificially flavored non-alcoholic carbonated soft drink, or to genuine spruce beer. The latter is now made only by a few microbreweries.

He was the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia from January 1993 to 31 December 2005 and the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service until 4 September 2012. Life and career Carmody attended secondary school at St. Bernard's College, Melbourne. Carmody joined the ATO in Melbourne in 1968, later moving to the ATO's National Office in Canberra in 1973. There he was involved in a wide range of taxation issues, including tax avoidance, legislation and tax reform. In 1983, Carmody relocated to Sydney where he assumed the role of First Assistant Deputy Commissioner. Later in the same year, he assumed the role of Deputy Commissioner in the ATO's Parramatta branch. Returning to National Office in 1986, Carmody was appointed as Second Commissioner in charge of revenue collection and audit, and in the following year, leader of the ATO's \\"modernisation program\\". Carmody holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Melbourne, and he attended Harvard University's six-week Advanced Management Program in 1989. Carmody was appointed Commissioner of Taxation in 1993. During his time as Commissioner, he was highly regarded internationally for what was viewed as an innovative approach to tax administration. During his almost 13-year career as Federal Commissioner of Taxation, Carmody oversaw the modernisation of the Australian Taxation Office (\\"ATO\\"), the implementation of a number of significant reforms to the Australian taxation system, and the design and implementation of a new compliance management program. Carmody's leadership of the ATO led to its push to encourage taxpayers to deal with the ATO and other Government agencies electronically. On 10 November 2005 Carmody announced that he would be leaving the office of Federal Commissioner of Taxation to take up a position as Chief Executive Officer of the then Australian Customs Service, replacing Lionel Woodward. He was replaced by Second Commissioner Michael D‚ÄôAscenzo from 1 January 2006. Carmody was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005 for his work in tax administration Carmody's retirement was announced by the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice Jason Clare on 24 August 2012. Clare described Carmody as a 44-year giant of the Commonwealth Public Service and reflected that his intellect, capacity and decency would be sorely missed by all in the Commonwealth Public Sector.

Umpiring career Scott began umpiring at age 15 and entered the minor leagues in 1981, eventually working his way up to the Triple-A American Association. He umpired a single major league game during the 1985 MLB season, making his debut in an August 19 game between the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers. Scott became a full-time MLB umpire in 1986, working 116 games that season. Scott worked a total of 3,897 regular season games, 91 post-season games, and issued 90 ejections in his MLB career. Scott umpired in the World Series in 1998, 2001 and 2004, in the All-Star Game in 1993, 2001, and 2011, calling balls and strikes. He has also worked in six League Championship Series (1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2013) and in twelve Division Series (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015). When the AL introduced red shirts in 1996, Scott frequently was the only umpire to wear the color, rather than the usual navy blue. He almost always wore the red shirt when working home plate, including Game 3 of the 1998 World Series at Qualcomm Stadium. Scott worked his last game on April 14, 2017, in Toronto.http://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=370414114 In the 8th inning he was struck in the mask and was carted off the field with a concussion and whiplash. This was Scott's fourth concussion in five years, his second in nine months. After consulting with several sports medicine and concussion specialists, Scott decided not to return, and announced his retirement in December 2017. Notable games On May 30, 1988, Scott ejected New York Yankees manager Billy Martin from a game against the Oakland Athletics. Martin was suspended for three games for throwing dirt at Scott during the argument. On July 1, 1990, Scott was the home plate umpire as Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched eight hitless innings in a road game against the Chicago White Sox, yet lost; it was, at the time, only the second game in history in which a pitcher lost a complete game no-hitter. In 1991 MLB revised the rules relating to official no-hit games, requiring that a pitcher must complete a minimum of 9 innings, and thereby voiding Hawkins' effort. He was the home plate umpire on April 27, 1994 when Scott Erickson threw a no- hitter for the Twins vs the Brewers.

The word \\"Canada\\" at this point referred to the territory along the Saint Lawrence River, then known as the Canada river, from Grosse Island in the east to a point between Quebec and Trois-Rivi√®res, although this territory had greatly expanded by 1600. French explorations continued \\"unto the Countreys of Canada, Hochelaga, and Saguenay\\" before any permanent settlements were established. Even though a permanent trading post and habitation was established at Tadoussac in 1600, at the confluence of the Saguenay and Saint Lawrence rivers, it was under a trade monopoly and thus not constituted as an official French colonial settlement. As a result, the first official settlement was not established within Canada until the founding of Quebec by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. The other four colonies within New France were Hudson's Bay to the north, Acadia and Newfoundland to the east, and Louisiana far to the south. Canada, the most developed colony of New France, was divided into three districts, Quebec, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Montreal, each with its own government. The governor of the District of Quebec was also the governor-general of all New France. Although the terms \\"Canada\\" and \\"New France\\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \\"New France actually represents a much broader portion of North American territory than the Great Lakes-St Lawrence colony of Canada\\". The Seven Years' War saw Great Britain defeat the French and their allies and take possession of Canada. In the Treaty of Paris of 1763, which formally ended the conflict, France renounced its claim to Canada in exchange for other colonies and the colony became the British colony of Quebec.\\"His Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts...\\"  Settled country  A 1740 survey of the population of the St. Lawrence River valley counted about 44,000 colonists, the majority born in Canada. Of those, 18,000 lived under the Government of Quebec, 4,000 under the Government of Trois-Rivi√®res and 22,000 under the Government of Montreal. The population was mostly rural; Quebec had 4,600 inhabitants; Trois-Rivi√®res had 378; and Montreal had 4,200 inhabitants. Also, √éle Royale had 4,000 inhabitants (of which 1,500 were in Louisbourg), and √éle Saint-Jean had 500 inhabitants. Acadia had 8,000 inhabitants.  Pays d'en Haut  Pays d'en Haut in pink around the Great Lakes in 1748 Dependent on Canada were the Pays d'en Haut (upper countries), a vast territory north and west of Montreal, covering the whole of the Great Lakes and stretching as far into the North American continent as the French had explored. Before 1717, when it ceded territory to the new colony of Louisiana, it stretched as far south as the Illinois Country. North of the Great Lakes, a mission, Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, was established in 1639. Following the destruction of the Huron homeland in 1649 by the Iroquois, the French destroyed the mission themselves and left the area. In what are today Ontario and the eastern prairies, various trading posts and forts were built such as Fort Kaministiquia in 1679 (at modern Thunder Bay, Ontario), Fort Frontenac in 1673 (today's Kingston, Ontario), Fort Saint Pierre in 1731 (near modern Fort Frances, Ontario), Fort Saint Charles in 1732 (on Lake of the Woods located on Magnusens Island on the Northwest Angle of Minnesota) and Fort Rouill√© in 1750 (today's Toronto). The mission and trading post at Sault Ste. Marie (1688) would later be split by the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The French settlements in the Pays d'en Haut among and south of the Great Lakes were Fort Niagara (1678) (near modern Youngstown, New York), Fort Crevecoeur (1680) (near the present site of Creve Coeur, Illinois, a suburb of Peoria, Illinois), Fort Saint Antoine (1686) (on Lake Pepin in Wisconsin), Fort St. Joseph (1691) (on the southernmost point of St. Joseph Island, Ontario on Lake Huron), Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit (1701) (today's Detroit, Michigan), Fort Michilimackinac (1715) (on the Straits of Mackinac at Mackinaw City, Michigan), Fort Miami (1715) (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana), Fort La Baye (1717) (today's Green Bay, Wisconsin), and Fort Beauharnois (1727) (in Florence Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota). Today, the term Les Pays-d'en-Haut refers to a regional county municipality in the Laurentides region of the present Province of Quebec, north of Montreal, while the former Pays d'en Haut was part of the District of Montreal.  Legacy  In its civil law, customs, and the cultural aspects of the majority of its population, the successor to the French colony of Canada is the Province of Quebec. The term Canada may also refer to today's Canadian federation created in 1867, or the historical Province of Canada, a British colony comprising southern Ontario and southern Quebec (referred to respectively as Upper Canada and Lower Canada when they were themselves separate British colonies prior to 1841). For Francophone Quebecers, preserving their distinctiveness from English Canada has been historically important, particularly since the rise of contemporary Quebec nationalism dating from the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Francophone Quebecers will therefore often use the term New France () when referring to Canada (New France), and the term , at one time used to refer to the French- speaking populations of colonial Canada, was replaced by the term (French- Canadian), and more recently by . Descendants of the original French-speaking population of Canada (New France) now living outside of Quebec are now often referred to by reference to their current province of residence, such as Franco-Ontarian. Francophone populations in the Maritime provinces apart from northwestern New Brunswick are, however, more likely to be descended from the settlers of the French colony of Acadia, and therefore still call themselves Acadians.

It was released in Japan on April 25, 2003. Nintendo cancelled the North American localization of Giftpia. In English, the game would most likely be better understood as called \\"Giftopia\\" to represent the two words, gift and utopia. Plot and gameplay Giftpia follows the protagonist Pockle, a resident of Nanashi Island, who, on the day of his coming of age ceremony, oversleeps and misses the whole thing. The mayor of the island, Mayer, is so incensed that he orders Pockle's arrest and a fine of five million \\"Mane\\" (the game's currency) to recoup the costs of the event. Thus, it is up to Pockle to work off his huge debt. At the game's start, Pockle must cope with heavy restrictions: an early curfew, a ball & chain, having his face pixelated and having robot police chief Mappo supervise him. Throughout his adventure, Pockle is assisted by his dog Tao and his girlfriend Kyappa. There is also a large cast of supporting characters that live on Nanashi Island and interact with Pockle, including a bartender that goes by Peevee and a radio DJ called DEEJ. Pockle eventually encounters an old man who will give him some mushroom soup and teach him about other paths to adulthood via helping others. Giftpia is similar to Nintendo's Animal Crossing in that both games place an emphasis on interacting with other characters. In order to meet the game's five million Mane requirement, the player must initially take menial jobs such as fishing, collecting fruit, or repairing signs. After meeting the old man, the player must travel the island, collecting its residents' wishes, and fulfill them. However, the player has numerous restrictions that are lifted as the game progresses. For instance, if the player stays out after curfew, ghosts will chase Pockle to his house. If he does not make it back, he will be put to sleep, making him vulnerable to theft. The player is also responsible for making Pockle eat, as he will otherwise starve to death. Development GiFTPiA was announced in early 2002 under the development of Skip Ltd. and the direction of former Square employee Kenichi Nishi. Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto signed on as one of the game's producers. According to the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Nintendo provided half of the game's ¬•500 million budget. Although the game was shown at E3 2003 in English and a North American localization seemed likely, the game remained exclusive to Japan. Nintendo stated that the game was not announced for a North America release. The website IGN thought that the game was not going to be released due to being \\"too strange\\" for US audiences, an assumption that was confirmed by Nintendo of America in early 2006. One of the game's planners, Sayoko Yokote, hoped the game would be localized by a company other than Nintendo. The music in GiFTPiA is provided via the in-game radio known as Nanashi-FM. The musical score was co-composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi and Yousuke Obitsumi and features over a dozen musical artists on the radio stations. The soundtrack was released on July 14, 2003 by Enterbrain alongside the Giftpia Book, a 99-page full color guide to the game. Reception Retail sales of Giftpia were unexceptional at best. According to estimates from Media Create and Dengeki, the game sold between 48,000 and 55,000 units during its first three weeks on sale in Japan. By the end of 2003, the game had sold nearly 70,000 units, ranking it 176th among all games in the country for that year. Giftpia was given a total score of 34 out of 40 by Famitsu, earning it a \\"Gold Award\\". The reviewers remarked that although game gives the initial impression it is for children, it offers \\"nice puzzle elements, great characters and a wonderful score\\". GiFTPiA was awarded a curious review score of ??% by the UK-based NGC Magazine. They felt unable to review it properly, but were sure that there was \\"...clearly a quite brilliant game lurking beneath the reams of Japanese text\\".

After working in the American League (AL) from 1988 to 1999, he umpired in both leagues from 2000 to 2009. Meriwether originally wore number 32, but in 2004 switched to number 14. Career After graduating from Athens State College in 1978, he first umpired in the minor leagues in 1979, reaching the American Association in 1986 before continuing up to the AL. He was an umpire in the 2004 World Series and the 2007 World Series, and in the All-Star Game in 1996 and 2002. He also umpired in the 2003 National League Championship Series and the 2006 American League Championship Series, and in eight Division Series (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2009). He was the third base umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the National League's 2007 wild card team. He was the third base umpire for David Cone's perfect game on July 18, 1999 and the second base umpire for Mark Buehrle's perfect game on July 23, 2009. Upon joining the AL's staff, Meriwether became only the fifth African American umpire in major league history, and the first in the AL since Emmett Ashford retired in 1970. Coincidentally, Meriwether was behind the plate when the Boston Red Sox ‚Äì the last major league team to integrate its roster ‚Äì won its first World Series in 86 years in 2004, and he was again behind the plate when they won the Series three years later in 2007. He worked on the same umpiring crew as Eric Cooper, who died six days before Meriwether, in 2004 and 2009. Before the start of the 2010 season, fellow MLB umpire Mike DiMuro wrote on his \\"Umps Care Blog\\" that Meriwether would sit out the 2010 season on the disabled list and then retire following the 2010 season. Meriwether did in fact miss the entire season, and retired along with fellow veteran umpires Mike Reilly and Jerry Crawford on February 23, 2011. The umpire dressing room at Nashville's First Horizon Park was named after Meriwether in 2016. At the time of his death, Meriwether was a supervisor of MLB umpires. Personal life Meriwether's son Chris was a walk-on point guard for the Vanderbilt University basketball team from 2008 to 2010. Meriwether died at his home in Nashville on October 26, 2019 at the age of 63 after a battle with cancer. Later that evening, there was a moment of silence in memory of Meriwether prior to Game 4 of the World Series.

After the declaration of independence in September 1945, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh played an important role in shaping the politics of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and creating the socialist structure of the new Vietnam.Vo Nguyen Giap, People‚Äôs War People‚Äôs Army (Ha Noi: The Gioi Publisher, 2004), pp. 33-139; John R Nordell, The Undetected Enemy: French and American Miscalculations at Dien Bien Phu, 1953 (Texas: Texas A&M; University Press, 1995), pp. 65-73. During the transitional period in Vietnam between 1941 and 1956, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was the General Secretary of the Communist Party as well as the real leader of the communist party in terms of designing strategies as well as implementing them. In 1957, after the failure of the Land Reform program, he was dismissed from his post of General Secretary and had less power. H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh selected L√™ Du·∫©n to succeed him as the General Secretary and he became the most powerful person after the 1960s.Tuong Vu, Vietnam's Communist Revolution: The Power and Limits of Ideology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 130-138. However, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was still an influential thinker in the Party during the second Indochina war and after the reunification of Vietnam; he was president of Vietnam from 1981 to 1987. Following the death of L√™ Du·∫©n in 1986, he succeeded Du·∫©n as top party leader. His last vital role was to carry forward the ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi renovation that still affects Vietnam to this day. Early life Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was named as ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n Khu. He changed his name from ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n Khu to Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh, which means Long March, in honor of the Long March which was the 6,000-mile military retreat of the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) between 1934-1936 led by Mao Zedong.Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Hanoi‚Äôs War: An International History of the War for Peace in Vietnam (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2012), p. 21. He was born on February 9, 1907, in the H√†nh Thi·ªán village, Xu√¢n H·ªìng sub-district, Xu√¢n Tr∆∞·ªùng district, Nam ƒê·ªãnh province (in the area of the Red River delta, 120 kilometers from Hanoi). He was the oldest son among five children of the ƒê·∫∑ng family which was an important family of the village. His siblings were ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã Y√™n, ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã U·∫©n, ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã T∆∞·ªùng, and ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n ƒê·ªânh.Nguy·ªÖn H∆∞∆°ng Giang, Ph·∫°m H√πng v√† Trung Ki√™n, T·ªïng B√≠ Th∆∞ Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh: Cu·ªôc ƒë·ªùi v√† S·ª± nghi·ªáp C√°ch m·∫°ng (Th√†nh ph·ªë H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh: NXB Ch√≠nh tr·ªã-H√†nh ch√≠nh, 2013), pp. 20-21. He grew up in a Confucian family which was not wealthy. His family background and his father highly shaped his knowledge and influenced him to join the anti- colonial movement. He had learned H√°n script (Classical Chinese) from his father and was sent to the district school. His grandfather, ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n B·∫£ng, was a Confucian intellectual who worked for the Nguy·ªÖn court under the reign of Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c and published many books about history, literature and Confucian ideology written in H√°n scripts.Ibid., pp. 15-17. His father was ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n Vi·ªán who was a famous Confucian scholar and wrote many history books. Unlike his grandfather, Vi·ªán was not interested to work for the Nguy·ªÖn court. Instead, he participated in the ƒê√¥ng Kinh Nghƒ©a th·ª•c (Tonkin Free School) movement against French colonialism in 1907.Ibid., p. 18. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's mother was Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã T·ª´ (1880-1964) who grew up in a Confucian mandarin family of the Nguy·ªÖn court.Th√¥ng T·∫•n X√£ Vi·ªát Nam(Vietnam News Agency), ƒê·ªìng Ch√≠ Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh (Comrade Truong Chinh) (Nh√† Xu·∫•t B·∫£n Th√¥ng T·∫•n: H√† N·ªôi, 2007), pp. 21-22. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh married Nguy·ªÖn Thi Minh, who remained loyal and carried on the burden of looking after the family, especially her husband's family after he was jailed for his political beliefs.Ibid., pp. 30-37. Leader of student movement In the midst of the political and social transition in Indochina, particularly the spread of French educational system in the nineteenth century. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was sent to educate in the French school, which was the starting point for his political movement.Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Op.cit., pp. 21-22. In 1923, he was sent to Th√†nh Chung secondary school, the first secondary school for the local people and taught in the Western educational system, located in Nam ƒê·ªãnh province.Nguy·ªÖn H∆∞∆°ng Giang, Ph·∫°m H√πng v√† Trung Ki√™n, Op.cit., p. 22. In the school, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was inspired by the French philosophers‚Äô works such as Jean-Jacque Rousseau and Montesquieu as well as the French revolution in 1789 and the Chinese revolution in 1911.Th√¥ng T·∫•n X√£ Vi·ªát Nam (Vietnam News Agency), ƒê·ªìng Ch√≠ Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh (Comrade Truong Chinh) (Nh√† Xu·∫•t B·∫£n Th√¥ng T·∫•n: H√† N·ªôi, 2007), p. 25. In Nam ƒê·ªãnh, he lived with a poor labour family who worked in the industrial factory. His childhood experience urged him to set up a student movement with his schoolmates, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hoan, ƒê·∫∑ng Ch√¢u T·ªá, Ph·∫°m NƒÉng ƒê·ªô, Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc L∆∞∆°ng, and Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c C·∫£nh.Vi·ªán H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh Huy·ªán Xu√¢n Th·ªßy, Op.cit., pp. 41-42. This group, later on, joined the student movement in Tonkin. They published newspapers in order to spread their thoughts on the anti-colonial movement. In 1925, when Phan B·ªìi Ch√¢u, the respectful nationalist, was captured in China and brought back to Vietnam, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was in the second year in high school. He joined the nationalist movement and printed leaflets together with his friends demanding the release of Phan B·ªìi Ch√¢u.Ibid., pp. 43-45. This was the first time he personally participated in a political movement. His second involvement was a year after that. In 1926, the death of Phan Chu Trinh (Phan Ch√¢u Trinh), the well-known nationalist, led to the huge protests all over Vietnam. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and his schoolmates asked a permission from the local authority to organize a mourning for Phan Chu Trinh.Nguy·ªÖn H∆∞∆°ng Giang, Ph·∫°m H√πng v√† Trung Ki√™n, Op.cit., p. 24-26. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh became the head of the student movement in Nam ƒê·ªãnh and cooperated with other schools. Not only students but peasants, labourers, and villagers numbering more than ten thousand also participated in the Phan Chu Trinh commemoration.Vi·ªán H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh Huy·ªán Xu√¢n Th·ªßy, Op.cit., pp. 44-45. The gathering turned violent and, as a result, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and other student leaders were taken away by the police together with more than 200 people. After this event, the French colonial administrators kept an eye on him.Nguy·ªÖn H∆∞∆°ng Giang, Ph·∫°m H√πng v√† Trung Ki√™n, Op.cit., pp. 25-26. He quit school in Nam ƒê·ªãnh. After that, he did self-study and passed the secondary school level exam. He moved to Hanoi to pursue his study in Indochinese trade college (tr∆∞·ªùng Cao ƒë·∫≥ng Th∆∞∆°ng m·∫°i ƒê√¥ng D∆∞∆°ng).Ibid., p. 26. In Ha Noi, he still focused on political movement with his friends from Nam ƒê·ªãnh and wrote for newspapers.  Road to Communist Party  When Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was in Ha Noi, he had an opportunity to choose his revolutionary path. In 1928, he joined the national salvation movement together with other Vietnamese young intellectuals.Ibid., pp.29-30. He read widely on Socialist works such as Marx and Engles, and Lenin. In 1929, he was one of first groups that founded the Communist Party of Indochina (1929-1930). He started to work on the Party's published works such as B√∫a Li·ªÅm newspaper and Ng∆∞·ªùi sinh vi√™n newspaper aimed to educate the people on the Socialist path; at condemning the French colonial government and at arousing the local mass as to ally with the Party.Shawn Frederick McHale, Print and Power: Confucianism, Communism, and Buddhism in the Making of Modern Vietnam(Honolulu: University of Hawai‚ÄôI Press, 2004), pp. 114-117.; Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh, ƒê·ªìng ch√≠ Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh v·ªõi b√°o ch√≠(H√† N·ªôi: NXB. Thanh ni√™n, 2003), pp. 14-15. However, in 1930, the Ngh·ªá Tƒ©nh-Soviet movement and the Y√™n B√°i mutiny started their own rebellion in Tonkin and this led the French colonial government to purge the political movement in Indochina.Christopher E. Goscha, The Penguin History of Modern Vietnam, pp. 150-151. In 1930 Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh became member of the Communist Party of Vietnam and was appointed to the Committee's propaganda of the Central Committee of Communist Party of Indochina. He was caught on November, 14th 1930 and was sentenced to twelve years, but was released in 1936.Ph·∫°m H√πng, Trung Ki√™n, Ho√†ng Ph√∫c, Op.cit, pp. 32-33. Although Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was imprisoned for his political beliefs H·ªèa L√≤ prison in Hanoi and deported S∆°n La prison in S∆°n La province for seven years, he was continuously active in the political movement.Th√¥ng T·∫•n X√£ Vi·ªát Nam, Op.cit., pp. 36-37. He was the leader of the Communist movement in the prisons where he published poems, articles, books about socialism and criticism of the Vietnam nationalist Party.Ph·∫°m H·ªìng Ch∆∞∆°ng (Ch·ªß bi√™n), Tr∆∞·ªùng-Chinh Ti·ªÉu s·ª≠ (H√† N·ªôi: NXB Ch√≠nh tr·ªã Qu·ªëc gia, 2007), p. 62. The colonial prison significantly became the revolutionary school for most of the intellectual revolutionists and communists.Peter Zinoman, Opcit., p. 212. After release from prison, he continued his political movement, especially through his books and newspaper articles. He was a journalist, a writer, and a socialist intellectual who used his writings under various pennames such as Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh, S√¥ng H·ªìng, T√¢n Tr√†o, T.C. and S.T. to fight the French colonial government since he was a teenager.Ph·∫°m H·ªìng Ch∆∞∆°ng (Ch·ªß bi√™n), Op.cit., pp. 64-65. He was also a strategist for the Indochinese Communist Party.  Political roles and ideology  Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's ideology was inspired by Marxism and Leninism and he was influenced by H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, as seen from his works on including revolutionary ideology, political and revolutionary strategies as well as cultural strategies and policies.Vi·ªán Nghi√™n c·ª©u H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh v√† c√°c L√£nh t·ª• c·ªßa ƒê·∫£ng, Tr∆∞·ªùng-Chinh v√† C√°ch M·∫°ng Vi·ªát Nam (H√† N·ªôi: NXB Ch√≠nh tr·ªã Qu·ªëc gia, 1997), pp. 8-22; Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢m. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh: M·ªôt t∆∞ duy s√°ng t·∫°i, M·ªôt t√†i nƒÉng ki·ªát xu·∫•t (H√† N·ªôi: NXB Ch√≠nh tr√≠ Qu·ªëc gia, 2007), pp. 1-15. According to the Communist Party, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was \\"Ho Chi Minh's excellent student\\",Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢m, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh: M·ªôt t∆∞ duy s√°ng t·∫°i, M·ªôt t√†i nƒÉng ki·ªát xu·∫•t (H√† N·ªôi: NXB Ch√≠nh tr√≠ Qu·ªëc gia, 2007), p. 12. although he did not always agree with Ho Chi Minh's ideas.Thai Quang Trung, Collective leadership and factionalism: an essay on Ho Chi Minh's legacy (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1985), pp. 15-19. There are two main arguments about Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's ideology. Firstly, his ideology was seen as radical and based on Maoism which is clearly evident in his published works and the pattern of the land reform program that he had borrowed from China.Ibid., pp. 9-17.; Mark Philip Bradley, Imaging Vietnam and America: The Making of Post-Colonial Vietnam, 1919-1950 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000), p. 32. Secondly, it was a hybrid incorporating Marxism and Leninism that formed the core of Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's ideology which supported the anti-colonial movement and did not oppose nationalism. His ideology firstly was influenced by the Soviet bloc, after that, China bloc, and was adopted in Vietnam contexts.Tuong Vu,Vietnam‚Äôs Communist Revolution: The Power and Limits of Ideology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017), pp. 15-19.  First Secretary of the Communist Party  Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh played a significant role in the Communist Party during the critical time in building and strengthening the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) power. Besides H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, he was a central figure of the ICP in the independence formation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV).David G. Marr, Vietnam: State, War, and Revolution (1945-1946)(Berkeley: University of California Press, 2013), pp. 12-14, 442-470. In the 1940s, during the time that H·ªì came back to Vietnam, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was already well known among the cadres of the Communist Party. He was portrayed as the radical leader of the Pro-Chinese faction while H·ªì led the Pro-Soviet faction.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 18-22.; Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Op.cit., pp. 25-27. During the Second World War, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh became the famous Communist leader in the north.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp.16-23. He served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party during a crisis when the French eliminated the leaders of the anti-French movement. In 1941, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indochina.David G. Marr, Vietnam 1945: The Quest of Power (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), p. 167. He was the party's second ranking leader after H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh. He was chaired of Party's National Conference in northern Tuy√™n Quang Province, launching an uprising to seize power from the French and Japanese.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 17-21. In the following years, the party fought a war for independence against French colonists.  August Revolution in 1945  When Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh became a leader in the anticolonialist movement, he also adopted the strategic theses of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He therefore was the person who significantly determined the direction of the communist movement, as well as the think-tank in laying the foundation of modern Vietnam.Th√¥ng T·∫•n X√£ Vi·ªát Nam, Op.cit., pp. 56-60. In fact, he was highly regarded by the members and supporters of the communist movement. In addition, during the anti-colonial period, he and General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p developed a military strategy that enabled Vietnam to defeat the Japanese forces during the World War II. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh emerged to play a crucial role in the August Revolution (C√°ch m·∫°ng th√°ng 8) in 1945.Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Op.cit.,p. 21-22. However, the political situation in the 1940s was divided into factionalism. The two factions consisted of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's and Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's who obviously had different strategies, especially in the 1945 August Revolution.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 9-10, 17-23. While Ho Chi Minh and his faction were based in P√°c B√≥ in north Vietnam, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and his followers moved down to Hanoi and focused on the Red River delta. The center of the Communist movement, therefore, separated into two centers.Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Op.cit, pp. 21-22. After the success of the August Revolution in 1945 and until 1956, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh faction was more powerful. The August Revolution was a major turning point and it led to the declaration of independence in September of the same year. On the day of Vietnam's declaration of independence, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was one of the leaders of the Communist Party who stood with H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh at the Ba ƒê√¨nh Square in Hanoi.  Land reform campaign in North Vietnam  A blot in Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's political life was the failure of the Land Reform campaign in the DRV between 1953 and 1956.Edwin E. Moise, Land Reform in China and North Vietnam: Consolidating the revolution at the village level(Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1983),pp. 146-147. The land reform campaign had a largely impact on Vietnamese society as it challenged the existing social and cultural structure. The land reform campaign was accompanied by extensive repression and excess, which resulted in the false imprisonment and execution of large numbers of people, many of whom were party members.Gittinger, J. Price, \\"Communist Land Policy in Viet Nam\\", Far Eastern Survey, Vol. 29, No. 8, 1957, p. 118. The land reform was proposed and pushed by Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh as the Secretary of the Workers Party of Vietnam (ƒê·∫£ng Lao ƒë·ªông Vi·ªát Nam). He aimed to change Vietnam to a new society which was neither feudal nor colonial society. He started developing his ideas of the land reform together with V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p in 1938. Both had published their work The Peasant Questions (V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ d√¢n c√†y) which critiqued the social structure in Vietnam and the peasants‚Äô problems in Vietnam. That work is praised from the Communist Party as the foundation of the understanding about agricultural system and Vietnamese peasants‚Äô life.Truong Chinh and Vo Nguyen Giap, The Peasant Question, 1937-1938, translated by Christine Pelzer White (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Southeast Asia Program, 1974) Before the land reform, the party started implementing tax reduction policies to help farmers.Qiang Zhai, China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975 (Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press, 2000), pp. 38-40. However, later on, the goal was to expand the mass base by allocating land to the peasants who formed the majority in the country, as well as managing the feudal class.Edwin E. Moise,Op.cit.,pp. 152-177. The land reform was debated among the party's leaders. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh had already been criticized for his unwillingness to agree with other party leaders and for his support of China while other leaders relied on the Soviet Union as their role model.Tuong Vu, ‚ÄúTo Be Patriotic is to Build Socialism‚Äù: Communist Ideology in Vietnam‚Äôs Civil War, in Dynamics of the Cold War in Asia: Ideology, Identity, and Culture, edited by Tuong Vu and Wasana Wongsurawat (New York: Palgrave, 2009), pp. 37-38. While Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was persuaded by other party members to use the Soviet model, he claimed that Vietnam was able to learn from China's land reform experience. In Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's view, the party needed land reform to gain mass support by having a peasant revolution, overthrowing the landlords, and being a step in the liberation of Vietnam.Tuong Vu, Vietnam‚Äôs Communist Revolution: The Power and Limits of Ideology, pp., 117-130. The party accepted Chinese guidance, because of its close relationship with China's leader, Mao Zedong. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh admired Mao's ideological strategies and he adopted Mao's land reform campaign.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 28-32. Scholars have different opinions towards the land reform in Vietnam. Firstly, the land reform in North Vietnam was actually considered as a radical program and the adaptation of the CCP model was implemented between 1946-1953. The party leaders also used the land reform campaign \\"land to the tillers\\" for economic collectivization.Daniel E. Teodoru, ‚ÄúThe Bloodbath Hypothesis: The Maoist Pattern in North Vietnam's Radical Land Reform,‚Äù in Southeast Asian Perspectives, No. 9 (Mar., 1973), pp. 20-26. However, another scholar pointed out that although Vietnam was mostly influenced by China, Vietnam's adaptation of the Chinese land reform had some differences to suit the Vietnamese context. The achievement of the revolution in China encouraged Vietnam to accept China as a model to design the policy and accept China as a consultant in policy implementation.Edwin E. Moise,Op.cit., pp. 234-136. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh presented the guideline for the land reform in April 1953. The Party passed the land reform decree and provided material support to the farmers. The land reform also aimed to strengthen psychological strategy to gain the support of the peasants. It also aimed to increase productivity and strengthen the war efforts against France.Qiang Zhai, Op.cit., p. 42. On December 4, 1953, the Legislature passed the Land Reform Act (Lu·∫≠t C·∫£i C√°ch Ru·ªông ƒê·∫•t), which marked a significant change as its implementation also purposed at eliminating the feudal system of landlords.Shuan Kingsley Malarney, Culture, Ritual and Revolution in Vietnam (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2002), p. 24. Unlike in China, the land reform failed in Vietnam resulting in famine and widespread starvation. Over almost four years, many criticisms arose from the political leaders and Vietnamese peasants who claimed it a \\"bloodbath reform\\" because many people were killed and murdered. In addition, many people died from starvation.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., p. 27. In 1956, more violence was reported which led to massive criticism and protests. The land reform was considered a failure of the communist party. Finally, the communist leaders had to terminate the land reform and Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh took responsibility by resigning from his post as General Secretary of the Communist Party.Edwin E. Moise, Op.cit.pp. 205-268. However, the land reform was a significant path for the Worker's Party and the rural structure. The land reform was successful in, at least, helping the rural peasants to own land.Daniel E. Teodoru, ‚ÄúThe Bloodbath Hypothesis: The Maoist Pattern in North Vietnam's Radical Land Reform,‚Äù in Southeast Asian Perspectives, No. 9 (Mar., 1973), pp. 20-26. The achievement of the land reform program indicated from the mass support from more than 200,000 peasants who willingly delivered supplies and crossed from mountains to valleys to support the Viet Minh to fight against the French troops.Qiang Zhai, Op.cit., pp. 38-42. Even though the land reform program was emphasized by many scholars as the failure of Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh was the mainstay in pushing the program after he had sought advice from Stalin and Mao.Vo Alex-Thai Do, ‚ÄúPreliminary Comments on Mobilizing the Masses, 1953‚Äù in Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia, Volume 31, Number 3, November 2016, pp. 989-994. After H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh visited China and personally discussed it with Mao in 1950, the land reform program was finally launched in 1953. This period also marked the closest cordial relations between the CCP and the Worker's Party. Mao fully supported both advisor team led by Luo Guibo and provisions not only for the land reform program but also the war against the French.Qiang Zhai, Op.cit., p. 42. Criticism was leveled at Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and the Communist Party. As a result, the massacres of the people, especially the landowners, were also severely criticized by party members. Many party members preferred to use the Soviet Union path instead. Finally, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, on behalf of the Party apologized with tears for the Party's mistake and held Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh responsible.Tuoitrenews, ‚ÄúVietnam displays past Land Reform at Hanoi exhibition‚Äù http://www.talkvietnam.com/2014/09/vietnam-displays-past- land-reform-at-hanoi-exhibition The failure of land reform in northern Vietnam was the turning point of the political faction. The Sino-Soviet split reduced China's influence in Hanoi. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh resigned from his post of the secretary general of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Since then, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh supported L√™ Du·∫©n, who later became the most powerful and longest-serving leader in Vietnam.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 25-38.; Nguyen Lien-Hang T., Op.cit, pp. 37-38. In the 1960s, L√™ Du·∫©n became the most powerful Communist leader while Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was still on the list of the Politburo and a member of the central committee of the party.Thai Quang Trung, Op.cit., pp. 27-28. He still maintained his role in the party's think tank.  Cultural ideology and strategy  After the declaration of independence in September 1945, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh played an important role in shaping the administration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam politically and economically, as well as creating the socialist structure and culture of the new Vietnam. He considered culture as a vital strategy for national liberation and nation-state building. In Vietnam, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was named as the architect of the foundation of the new culture of Vietnam because his cultural ideology had a great impact on Vietnamese society through many concrete ideas and policies.Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢m, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh: M·ªôt t∆∞ duy s√°ng t·∫°i, M·ªôt t√†i nƒÉng ki·ªát xu·∫•t, pp. 412-422. His works that have affected the Vietnamese society were the 1943 \\"Theses on Vietnam Culture (ƒê·ªÅ C∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn h√≥a Vi·ªát Nam)\\" and the 1948 ‚Äúthe Marxism and Vietnamese Culture‚Äù (Ch·ªß nghƒ©a M√°c v√† v·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ vƒÉn h√≥a Vi·ªát Nam). In the first work, \\"Theses on Vietnam Culture,\\" Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh presented two main cultural patterns: the foundation of the new Vietnamese culture under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the use of art and cultural concepts as a weapon against national enemies.Kim Ngoc Bao Ninh, World Transformed: The Politics of Culture in Revolutionary Vietnam, 1945-1965 (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 2005), pp. 26-28. He argued that Vietnam had fallen under the influence of Chinese culture of feudalism, French colonialism and Japanese fascists. In order to liberate Vietnam from these cultures, the Party needed to create a new culture (vƒÉn h√≥a m·ªõi). The essence of the new culture focused on people and adopted a new democratic approach.Ibid., p. 30-31. The second work, \\"The Marxism and Vietnamese Culture,\\" Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh suggested the cultural revolution as a tool to fight the French colonial government under the principle of Marxism. The significance of culture was equal with the military and economic battle fronts.Ibid., pp. 433-458., Kim Ngoc Bao Ninh, Op.cit., pp. 26-47. These two works became the fundamental elements to Vietnam society and culture and brought big changes to Vietnam society, particularly after the 1945 August Revolution. The key tool in eliminating the enemies of the nation was the expansion of the new democratic culture into the French-occupied cultural space as well as making the new democratic culture a national culture at the same time.Ibid., pp. 30-39. Cultural policy and the construction of the new culture of Vietnam significantly strengthened the nationalism through arts, performance, media and national history. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh significantly built the Cultural Association for National Salvation in order to centralize artists who worked to publicize Party's ideology and appeal to local people for support.Ibid.., pp. 54-60. However, under the atmosphere of social restructuring was a large number of villagers who had some interactions with the landlord families became paranoid and fearful of the communists. The pressure to condemn the public's enemies finally led to the destruction of local social networks. Many people in North Vietnam were unable to withstand the pressure. Many of them committed suicide or escaped to South Vietnam.Ibid., pp. 33-56. The process of creating a new cultural space was to equalize people's status including anti-feudal symbols and linguistic patterns. The new cultural pattern was not always successful although the Party forced it through the propaganda campaign. In some communities, many villagers still respected the condemned feudal people.Shuan Kingsley Malarney, Op.cit., p. 46. The fundamental ideology of Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh influentially and violently affected north Vietnam, particularly during the land reform. The cultural impact of the land reform led to social turmoil in many communities. Particularly during the land reform, the Party's cadres were sent to the communities and violently wiped out what they believed was the feudal legacy and backwardness including superstition, feudal cultures such as clothes, old traditions, and norms.Ibid.., pp. 37-39. The landlords were charged with such offenses. Regardless of whether they were supporters of the Communist Party or not, they were judged as exploiters of the peasants.Ibid., pp. 33-37. Furthermore, a group of the Communist supporters, called themselves as Nh√¢n vƒÉn gi·∫£i ph·∫©m criticized the radical policy of Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh's cultural ideology during the implementation of the Land Reform program. However, many people in this group were jailed or forced to use the labour in the backcountry.Keith W. Taylor, A History of the Vietnamese(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 570-572.  ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi (Renovation)  Vietnam was unified in 1975, and Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was selected president in 1981. The economic renovation was credited to Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Linh who succeeded General Secretary after Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh in 1986. However, Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢m writes that Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was the first person who paved the way for economic renovation since 1968.Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢m, L√™ Du·∫©n ‚Äì Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh: Hai nh√† l√Ω lu·∫≠n xu·∫•t s·∫Øc c·ªßa c√°c m·∫°ng Vi·ªát Nam (H√† N·ªôi: NXB Ch√≠nh tr·ªã Qu·ªëc gia, 2002), pp. 175-217. In the midst of economic recession, scarcity and social crisis in the 1980s, the Central Committee received various reports about economic loss, inflations, and the increased social problems. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh set up the research teams in order to collect and observe problems in local communities in the Central highland and in southern Vietnam as well as the success and failures from the old economic system.Ibid., pp. 276-285. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh came to be receptive to reformists and gradually sided with them after visits to the countryside in 1983. He used the research results to reform policies and presented them to the Sixth National Congress in 1986. He suggested that economic renovation was not enough to deal with the crisis that Vietnam encountered. The Party also needed to reform political and social policies.Ibid., pp. 175-217. Furthermore, he asserted that production capacity needed to be increased. Although, Socialist ideology rejected Capitalism, it could not avoid the economic acceleration by increasing production capacity. Instead of focusing on industrial sector, the Party needed to support and increase agricultural production as the root of Vietnam society.Ibid., pp. 276-285. In addition, the 1986 renovation (ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi) was driven by the changing world order that saw the collapse of the Socialist bloc and the domestic motivation within Vietnam, particularly among the Communist leaders. The economic renovation also affected areas such as politics in Vietnam and relationships among the Communist leaders, the vanishing financial support from the Soviet Union, the diplomatic policy in seeking for the economic cooperation within the region.David W. P. Elliot, Changing Worlds: Vietnam's Transition from the Cold War to Globalization, pp. 33-35. In this economic transition, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh was the new reformer as seen in the fellow communist leader V√µ VƒÉn Ki·ªát's writing in which he praised Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh as the only comrade who completely understood the real ideology of Socialism and also tried to principally adopt it in the society.Ibid., pp. 36-40. However, he was replaced by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Linh at the Sixth National Congress in December 1986, part of a sweeping leadership change that marked the beginning of the ƒê·ªïi m·ªõi (Renovation) period. Death Throughout his life, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh devoted himself to the political movement in spite of the failed land reform. His role had a great impact on the political struggles of the party as he was still the Party's think-tank throughout his whole life. Since he became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam between 1941 and 1956 and again between July and December 1986, he was also a member of the Politburo Political Party Committee from 1951 to 1986. He was the Chairman of the National Assembly from 1960 to 1981. After President Ho Chi Minh passed away in 1969, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh continued his work with L√™ Du·∫©n and Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng. After L√™ Du·∫©n passed way in 1986, he became the highest ranking in the Communist Party as the President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. He ended his career by initiating the successful economic renovation (ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi renovation) in 1986. He resigned as president in 1987 due to ill health. Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh died on September 30, 1988 aged 81.

Having worked in the National League from 1982 to 1999, he became a member of the unified umpiring staff for Major League Baseball in 2000. He has been a crew chief since 1999. He has umpired five World Series, nine League Championship Series and eleven League Division Series. He has also worked in the All-Star Game four times. Davis has worn uniform number 12 throughout his career. As of the start of the 2019 season, Davis is MLB's second-most senior umpire (after Joe West), although Davis has the longest uninterrupted tenure due to West being forced to sit out two seasons (2000-01) after the failed mass resignation strategy of former Major League Umpires Association executive director Richie Phillips in July 1999. Davis, along with all National League umpires at the time, tendered his resignation, but rescinded it, and was not chosen as one of the 22 MLB umpires to lose their jobs by commissioner Bud Selig and MLB executive vice president Sandy Alderson. Davis' 2019 crew consists of Greg Gibson, Brian Knight and Pat Hoberg. Umpiring career Davis in 2014 Davis began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1976. He worked in the Midwest League, Eastern League and American Association before being promoted to the majors in 1982. He has officiated in 22 postseasons, including the World Series in 1996, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2012; the League Championship Series in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2018; the Division Series in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015; and the Wild Card Game in 2013, 2014 and 2018. He also umpired the All-Star Game in 1989, 1997, 2002 and 2012; he called balls and strikes on the last two occasions.Gerry Davis Retrosheet.org. Retrieved 3 July 2012Gerry Davis named home plate ump ESPN.com. Retrieved 3 July 2012 In the 2014 season, Davis's crew was Phil Cuzzi, Brian Knight, and a AAA fill-in umpire, until Quinn Wolcott was officially hired as a full-time umpire in July 2014 due to the retirement of Gary Darling. In 2016, his crew includes Sam Holbrook, Rob Drake and a AAA Call-Up Umpire. Davis was reprimanded by Major League Baseball on September 1, 2014 for making 'crybaby' faces at Oakland A's players. The league statement said, \\"We expect our umpires to remain professional on the field at all times.\\"http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_26451829/mlb-wont-discuss- incident-between-and-umpire-gerry Notable games Davis was the second base umpire for the perfect game pitched by Randy Johnson on May 18, 2004. On September 19 at Tropicana Field, instant replay overturned a call on the field for the first time ever in the major leagues. A fly ball hit by Tampa Bay Rays' first baseman Carlos Pe√±a, the umpires ruled, was interfered with by a fan sitting in the front row of the stands, when the ball hit the hands of the fan and fell back onto the field of play. After Joe Maddon requested the umpires hold a conference to discuss the play, the umpires, headed by Gerry Davis, decided to look at instant replay. Just over four minutes later, Davis returned to the field and signaled that the ball was a home run. Davis was the home plate umpire for the last game played at Shea Stadium on September 28, 2008. With his assignment to the 2012 World Series, Davis set an officiating record for most postseason games umpired in major league history with 115 and since then this mark has moved forward to 128 games. On April 23, 2014, Davis ejected New York Yankees starting pitcher Michael Pineda for having pine tar on his neck. On July 26, 2017, Davis asked Texas Rangers third baseman Adri√°n Beltr√© to move closer to the on-deck circle. After Beltr√© jokingly moved the on-deck batting circle, Davis ejected him. Business Davis owns a company, Gerry Davis Sports, which specializes in umpiring equipment and clothing. Gerry Davis Sports sells specially designed leg guards which give a small area at the top for the hands to rest, consistent with Davis's unique umpiring stance. (When umpiring behind the plate, Davis bends down only about three- quarters as far as the conventional stance. He leans his back forward slightly and grabs the top of his leg guards with his extended arms.) These leg guards also eschew the normal straps with metal hooks, in favor of straps with plugs that hook into little notches.

This may be as a result of victory in war, or because a crisis has been peacefully resolved and military force will not be necessary. The opposite of demobilization is mobilization. Forceful demobilization of a defeated enemy is called demilitarization. In the final days of World War II, for example, the United States Armed Forces developed a demobilization plan which would discharge soldiers on the basis of a point system that favoured length and certain types of service. The British armed forces were demobilised according to an \\"age-and-service\\" scheme. See Alan Allport, Demobbed. Coming Home after the Second World War, Yale University Press, 2009. The phrase demob happy refers to demobilization and is broadly applied to the feeling of relief at imminent release from a time- serving burden, such as a career.Demob In the Russian language it is known as dembel and has become a certain tradition in the Soviet and post-Soviet Armed Forces.

He was appointed in October 1985 by Ronald Reagan and took senior status on November 1, 2000. On June 11, 2008, Silberman was named a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor granted by the government of the United States. Family and education Born in York, Pennsylvania, Silberman graduated from Dartmouth College with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1957 and Harvard Law School with a Bachelor of Laws in 1961. He served in the United States Army from 1957 to 1958. His first wife, Rosalie \\"Ricky\\" Gaull Silberman, co-foundress of the Independent Women's Forum, died on February 17, 2007. Silberman has since married Patricia Winn Silberman. Silberman has three children, Robert S. Silberman, Kate Balaban, and Anne Otis. Silberman is also a friend of Justice Clarence Thomas and in 1989 encouraged a young and then-reluctant Thomas to accept a federal judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Career Silberman has worked in the private sector as a partner at the law firms Moore, Silberman & Schulze in Honolulu and Morrison & Foerster and Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. He has also served as Executive Vice President of Crocker National Bank in San Francisco. His government service includes stints as an attorney in the NLRB's appellate section, as Solicitor of Labor from 1969 to 1970, and as Undersecretary of Labor from 1970 to 1973. As Solicitor, he was largely responsible for developing the requirement of goals and timetables as an enforcement device for the affirmative action order. He subsequently regretted his stance, writing, \\"Our use of numerical standards in pursuit of equal opportunity has led to the very quotas guaranteeing equal results that we initially wished to avoid.\\" He also led the development of legislation to implement \\"final offer selection\\" as a means of resolving labor disputes. As Undersecretary, he repeatedly clashed with Charles \\"Chuck\\" Colson and tendered his resignation in order to compel the hiring of a black regional director in New York in 1972. As Deputy Attorney General of the United States from 1974 to 1975, Silberman was tasked with reviewing J. Edgar Hoover's secret files, which he has described as \\"the single worst experience of my long governmental service.\\" Silberman has stated that \\"this country‚Äîand the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äîwould be well served if [Hoover's] name were removed from the bureau's building. It is as if the Defense Department were named for Aaron Burr. Liberals and conservatives should unite to support legislation to accomplish this repudiation of a very sad chapter in American history.\\" Silberman also served briefly as Acting Attorney General during the Watergate crisis, an experience he has described as awkward: \\"We were simultaneously carrying out President Nixon's agenda and supporting those who were vigorously prosecuting him.\\" Gerald Ford appointed Silberman as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1975 to 1977. At the same time, Silberman also served as the Presidential Special Envoy for International Labor Organization Affairs. As Ambassador, he succeeded in freeing an American, Laszlo Toth, who had been falsely imprisoned by the regime as a \\"CIA agent,\\" by putting pressure on both the Yugoslav regime and the State Department.Malcolm W. Browne, \\"Tito Attacks U.S. Envoy for 'Pressure Campaign,'\\" New York Times Aug. 1, 1976. During the campaign for the 1980 presidential election, he was co-chairman of Ronald Reagan's foreign policy advisors. From 1981 to 1985, he served as a member of the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament and the Defense Policy Board. Federal judicial service Silberman was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on September 11, 1985, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 25, 1985, and received commission on October 28, 1985. He assumed senior status on November 1, 2000. Silberman was on the short list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court on three separate occasions in 1987, 1990, and 1991.\\"He's Always on the Short List,\\" Charley Roberts, Los Angeles Daily Journal, 1992. He was a member of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review at the time of its first ever session in 2002. On February 6, 2004, Silberman was appointed co-chairman of the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent blue-ribbon panel created to investigate U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In the wake of the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as United States Attorney General in 2007, Silberman was mentioned as a possible successor. In 2008, Silberman, joined by five other federal court colleagues, filed suit against the United States, \\"claiming that when Congress refused to authorize statutory cost-of-living raises for federal judges, it violated the Compensation Clause [of the Constitution].\\" The suit was ultimately successful, leading to a nationwide rise in pay for all federal judges as of January 1, 2014. In 2015, Silberman wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, writing that the charge that \\"President Bush deceived the American people about the threat from Saddam\\" reminded him of \\"a similarly baseless accusation that helped the Nazis come to power in Germany\\".Brendan James, Federal Appeals Judge Compares People Who Say Bush Lied To Rise Of Nazis Talking Points Memo Feb 9, 2015 Legal opinions As a judge, Silberman has authored a number of noteworthy opinions: * In In re Sealed Case, 838 F.2d 476 (1988), Silberman held that the procedures for appointing independent counsels violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and the separation of powers, because they interfered with the President's ability to ensure that the laws are \\"faithfully executed.\\" This decision was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), over a vigorous dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia.Morrison v. Olson, . After the Clinton impeachment episode, many changed their minds on this issue and praised Judge Silberman and Justice Scalia's position.Dartmouth Alumni Magazine, Nov./Dec. 2008, p. 48. * In a later per curiam decision captioned In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001, 310 F.3d 717 (2002), the court upheld a provision of the Patriot Act that made it easier for law enforcement officers and intelligence officers to share information with each other. This was an important decision involving interpretation of the Patriot Act, the use of foreign intelligence, and the role of the FISA Court. Silberman subsequently disclosed that he had in fact written the opinion. * In Parker v. District of Columbia, 478 F.3d 370 (2007), Silberman held that the District of Columbia's flat ban on the registration and carrying of firearms violated the Second Amendment right \\"to keep and bear arms.\\" The case was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008).District of Columbia v. Heller, , 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008). * In Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F.3d 1 (2011), Silberman authored an opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act as a constitutional exercise of the Commerce Power, on the grounds that individuals' decisions to remain uninsured, in the aggregate, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. At the time, a number of commentators viewed Judge Silberman's opinion as an important bellwether of how the Supreme Court might decide the case.Simon Lazarus (2011-11-09). \\"May It Please the Court.\\" Slate.com. Retrieved 2012-11-18.Noah Feldman (2011-11-13). \\"Conservative Health-Care Split Offers Court a Path\\". Bloomberg. Retrieved 2012-11-18. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected Judge Silberman's reasoning in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012), by a vote of 5 to 4, upholding the Affordable Care Act instead as an exercise of the taxing power.National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, , 132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012) Some commentators praised Silberman, a Reagan appointee, for his \\"judicial restraint\\" in upholding the signature statute of a Democratic administration. Writing in Slate, Simon Lazarus described Silberman as a \\"conservative icon\\" and noted that \\"despite intense short-term political pressures and long-term ideological stakes, leading conservative jurists appear likely to stick to their traditional judicial restraint canon when deciding the fate of the [Affordable Care Act].\\"\\"Why this week's decision upholding Obamacare may carry extra eight at the Supreme Court,\\" Simon Lazarus, Slate (Nov. 9, 2011). Criticism  \\"October Surprise\\"  Some politically hostile commentators have speculated that Silberman may have been involved in the so-called \\"October Surprise\\" with respect to the Iran hostage crisis prior to the 1980 presidential election, alleging that Silberman and others had attended meetings to negotiate the delayed release of the hostages by the Iranian government. Silberman has publicly responded as follows to the allegations: On January 3, 1993, the bipartisan Joint Report of the Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980, also known as the \\"October Surprise Task Force,\\" was released. The Task Force, led by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D) and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R), specifically concluded that \\"there is wholly insufficient evidence of any communications by or on behalf of the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign with any persons representing or connected with the Iranian government or with those holding Americans as hostages during the 1979-1981 period\\" and that \\"there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt or proposal to attempt, by the Reagan Presidential Campaign‚Äîor persons representing or associated with the campaign‚Äîto delay the release of the American hostages in Iran.\\"  Iran-Contra Affair  Silberman served on a panel of the D.C. Circuit in U.S. vs. Oliver L. North, 910 F.2d 843 (1990), in which a per curiam opinion was issued that overturned the conviction of Oliver North, who had been a key figure in perpetrating the Iran-Contra Affair. In his memoir, Firewall, published seven years after the case in 1997, Lawrence Walsh, the Independent Counsel appointed by President Reagan to investigate the Iran-Contra affair, mused that in retrospect, he wishes that he had moved for Silberman's recusal from the panel: Silberman has also observed that David Brock, latterly a Silberman critic (see below), has published a refutation of Lawrence Walsh's characterization of Judge Silberman's involvement in the North case:  Clarence Thomas confirmation  In his book Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative, David Brock dedicates several pages to criticizing Silberman. In 2006, Silberman responded to Brock's allegations in a posting on Michael Barone's U.S. News & World Report blog.  Confederate Graves  On June 15, 2020, The Intercept reported on an email exchange initiated by Silberman related to Confederate graves. In his email to all staff at the court, Silberman wrote, \\"Since I am about to be interviewed I thought it would be appropriate to unburden myself in opposition to the madness proposed by Senator Warren: the desecration of Confederate graves.\\" Silberman appeared to be referring to a debate over the National Defense Authorization Act, to which Senator Warren proposed an amendment requiring the renaming of military assets that bear the names of or otherwise honor anyone who served in the Confederacy. Senator Warren opposed an exception for graves and monuments, but the final version passed by the Senate included an exception for gravesites. In his email, Silberman argued that the graves of Confederate soldiers should not have the names removed merely because the dead fought for the Confederacy. He went on to argue that slavery was a sin of the entire nation, not just the South, saying \\"It's important to remember that Lincoln did not fight the war to free the Slaves [sic] Indeed he was willing to put up with slavery if the Confederate States Returned [sic].\\" Silberman explained his personal connection to the issue, stating that \\"My great great grandfather Never owned slaves as best I can tell,\\" but that his two sons fought on opposite sides in the war. Silberman's great-grandfather fought for the union under Ulysses S. Grant and was badly wounded at Shiloh, and the other brother joined the Confederate Army and was captured at Gettysburg. Silberman concluded both should be allowed to rest in peace. The email went unanswered for roughly a day, until a clerk responded saying, \\"I am one of only five black law clerks in this entire circuit. However, the views I express below are solely my own.\\" The clerk went on, \\"[s]ince no one in the court's leadership has responded to your message, I thought I would give it a try.\\" The response included an analysis of how a newly freed slave would view Lincoln vis-a-vis Silberman's comments, as well as the point of view that the Confederacy was at its heart about supporting slavery and that in the end the Confederacy was defeated. The clerk ended his email by using Silberman's own legal writings and logic. \\"...I will note that the current movement to rename Government owned facilities is in line with your previous opinions on the importance of names and what they represent. In 2005, you publicly advocated for the removal of J. Edgar Hoover's name from the FBI Building due to the problematic material you came across in your review of his FBI files after his death. You equated it to the Defense Department being named for Aaron Burr. In view of your opinion of J. Edgar Hoover's history and your advocacy for renaming the FBI building because of the prominence it provides Hoover's legacy, it is very strange that you would be against renaming our military facilities, since the legacy of the Confederacy represents the same thing. This moment of confronting our nation's racial history is too big to be disregarded based on familial ties.\\" Silberman responded to the clerk's email, thanking the clerk for the thoughtful message and emphasizing that his \\"concern was limited to cemeteries\\" and not monuments or forts. Academic career Silberman was a Lecturer at the University of Hawaii Law School from 1962 to 1963. He was an Adjunct Professor of Administrative Law at Georgetown University Law Center from 1987 to 1994 and from 1997 to 1999, at NYU from 1995 to 1996, and at Harvard in 1998. He held the position of Distinguished Visitor from the Judiciary at Georgetown University Law Center from 2000 to 2019 and taught both administrative law and labor law. Silberman received the Charles Fahy Distinguished Adjunct Professor Award for the 2002-2003 academic year. He has also received a Lifetime Service Award (2006) and a Distinguished Service Award (2007) from the Federalist Society chapters of Georgetown and Harvard, respectively.

He has served on that court since 1997. A native of the Chicago area, Garland attended Harvard University for his undergraduate and legal education. After serving as a law clerk to Judge Henry J. Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court of the United States, he practiced corporate litigation at Arnold & Porter and worked as a federal prosecutor in the United States Department of Justice, where he played a leading role in the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers. On March 16, 2016, President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia. Despite Republicans themselves having spent years suggesting Garland as an acceptable Democratic choice, the Senate Republican majority refused to hold a hearing or vote on this nomination made during the last year of Obama's presidency, with the Republican majority insisting that the next elected president should fill the vacancy. The unprecedented refusal of a Senate majority to consider the nomination was deemed highly controversial. Some Republican lawmakers even suggested leaving the court with just eight seats if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, saying they would block Garland or any other nominee and keep the seat vacant for at least another presidential term. Garland's nomination lasted 293 days and expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. The seat Garland was nominated for was eventually filled by Neil Gorsuch, appointed by President Donald Trump. Early life and education Merrick Brian Garland was born in Chicago. He was raised in the northern suburb of Lincolnwood in the Chicago area.Nina Totenberg & Carrie Johnson, His mother Shirley (n√©e Horwitz) was a director of volunteer services at Chicago's Council for Jewish Elderly (now called CJE SeniorLife); his father, Cyril Garland, headed Garland Advertising, a small business run out of the family's home. Born to a Jewish family, Garland was raised in Conservative Judaism. His grandparents left the Russian Empire (then the Pale of Settlement) in the early 20th century, fleeing antisemitic pogroms and seeking a better life for their children in the United States. Garland attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, where he was president of the student council, acted in theatrical productions, and was a member of the debate team. He graduated in 1970 as the class valedictorian. Garland was also a Presidential Scholar and National Merit Scholar. Garland attended Harvard College on a scholarship, graduating as valedictorian with an A.B. degree summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in social studies in 1974. He initially wanted to become a physician, but quickly decided to become a lawyer instead. Garland allied himself with his future boss, Jamie Gorelick, when he was elected the only freshman on a campus-wide committee. During his college summers Garland volunteered as Congressman Abner J. Mikva's speechwriter. After President Jimmy Carter appointed Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, Mikva would rely on Garland when selecting clerks. At Harvard, Garland wrote news articles and theater reviews for the Harvard Crimson and worked as a Quincy House tutor. Garland wrote his 235-page honors thesis on industrial mergers in Britain in the 1960s. Garland then attended Harvard Law School, graduating with a J.D. magna cum laude in 1977. During law school, Garland was a member of the Harvard Law Review, serving as an articles editor from 1976 to 1977. As an articles editor, Garland assigned himself to edit a submission by Justice William Joseph Brennan Jr. on the topic of the role of state constitutions in safeguarding individual rights.Tony Mauro, How Merrick Garland Landed a Supreme Court Clerkship With Brennan, National Law Journal (March 26, 2018). Garland's correspondence with Brennan ultimately helped him win a clerkship with the justice. Garland ran for president of the Review, but lost to Susan Estrich. Following graduation, Garland served as a law clerk for Judge Henry J. Friendly of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1977 to 1978, and then Justice Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1978 to 1979. Department of Justice and private practice Garland was special assistant to Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti from 1979 to 1981. After the Carter administration ended in 1981, Garland joined the law firm Arnold & Porter as an associate, and was a partner at the firm from 1985 to 1989. While at Arnold & Porter, the white shoe firm founded by Justice Abe Fortas, Garland mostly practiced corporate litigation. In Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (1983) Garland acted as counsel to an insurance company suing to reinstate an unpopular automatic seat belt mandate. After winning the case in both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court, Garland would write an eighty-seven page Harvard Law Review article describing the way courts use a heightened \\"hard look\\" standard of review and scope of review when an agency chooses deregulation, with increasing focus on the fidelity of the agencies' actions to congressional intent. In 1985-86, while at Arnold & Porter, Garland was a lecturer in law at Harvard Law School, where he taught antitrust law. He has also published an article in the Yale Law Journal urging a broader application of antitrust immunity to state and local governments.Merrick B. Garland, Antitrust and State Action: Economic Efficiency and the Political Process, 96 Yale L.J. 486 (1987). In 1989, desiring to return to public service and do more trial work, Garland became an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. As a line prosecutor, Garland represented the government in criminal cases ranging from drug trafficking to complex public corruption matters. Garland was one of three principal prosecutors who handled the investigation into Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry's possession of cocaine. Garland then briefly returned to Arnold & Porter, working there from 1992 to 1993. In 1993, Garland joined the new Clinton administration as deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice. The following year, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick‚Äîa key mentor of Garland's‚Äîasked Garland to be her principal deputy associate attorney general. In that role, Garland's responsibilities included the supervision of high-profile domestic-terrorism cases, including the Oklahoma City bombing, Ted Kaczynski (also known as the \\"Unabomber\\"), and the Atlanta Olympics bombings. Garland insisted on being sent to Oklahoma City in the attack's aftermath to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution. He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols. Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating. D.C. Circuit Appointment On September 6, 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seat vacated by his longtime mentor Abner J. Mikva. Justice Brennan, for whom Garland clerked, recommended Garland for the position in a letter to Clinton. The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Garland a \\"well- qualified\\" committee rating, its highest. On December 1, 1995, Garland received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Senate confirmation hearings Garland said that the Supreme Court justices whom he most admired were Justice Brennan, for whom he clerked, and Chief Justice John Marshall. Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. Senate Republicans did not then schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation, not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat. After winning the November 1996 presidential election, Clinton renominated Garland on January 7, 1997. Garland's confirmation vote came to the floor of the Republican- controlled Senate on March 19, 1997. He was confirmed in a 76‚Äì23 vote and received his judicial commission the next day. The majority of Republican senators voted to confirm Garland, including Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, and Jim Inhofe. Senators Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Jeff Sessions were among those who voted against Garland. All of the 23 \\"no\\" votes came from Republicans, and all were based \\"on whether there was even a need for an eleventh seat\\" on the D.C. Circuit.Amy Steigerwalt, Battle over the Bench: Senators, Interest Groups, and Lower Court Confirmations (University of Virginia Press, 2010), p. 224 n. 34. Service as chief judge Garland became chief judge of the D.C. Circuit on February 12, 2013. As chief judge, Garland announced in May 2013 that the D.C. Circuit had unanimously decided to provide the public with same-day audio recordings of oral arguments in the court. As chief judge, Garland was an active member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and was involved in the formulation of new rules to protect federal judicial branch employee from workplace harassment, which were adopted in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Alex Kozinski. Garland's seven-year term as chief judge ended on February 11, 2020, with Judge Sri Srinivasan succeeding him. Garland continues to serve as an active member of the court. Notable cases Garland is considered a judicial moderate and a centrist. Garland has been described by Nina Totenberg and Carrie Johnson of NPR as \\"a moderate liberal, with a definite pro-prosecution bent in criminal cases\\". Tom Goldstein, the publisher of SCOTUSblog, wrote in 2010 that \\"Judge Garland's record demonstrates that he is essentially the model, neutral judge. He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements.\\" Garland has a reputation for collegiality, and his opinions rarely draw a dissent. As of 2016, Garland had written just fifteen dissents in his two decades on the court, fewer than his colleague Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote some 17 dissents over the previous decade. Administrative and environmental law Garland has tended to favor deference to regulatory agencies. For example, in In re Aiken County (2013), Garland dissented when the court issued mandamus ordering the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository license. In Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration (2013), Garland joined a divided court upholding the DEA's classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. However, according to Goldstein, in a number of split decisions on environmental law Garland \\"favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups.\\" In Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton (2003), Garland found the arroyo toad was protected by the federal Endangered Species Act. Circuit Judge John Roberts dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, writing that Congress's interstate commerce power cannot reach \\"a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\\" Criminal law and whistleblower protection While on the bench, Garland has shown a tendency to be deferential to the government in criminal cases, siding with prosecutors in ten of the fourteen criminal cases in which he disagreed with a colleague. For example, in United States v. Watson (1999), Garland dissented when the court concluded a prosecutor's closing argument was unduly prejudicial, objecting that a conviction should only be reversed for \\"the most egregious of these kind of errors.\\" In 2007, Garland dissented when the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed the conviction of a Washington, D.C. police officer who had accepted bribes in an FBI sting operation. Garland has taken a broad view of whistleblower protection laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA), which creates a private cause of action against those defrauding the federal government. For example, in United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University (1998), Garland wrote for the court in holding that a plaintiff alleging he had been fired by Howard University for whistleblowing could sue under the FCA for retaliation. In United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp. (2004), Garland dissented when the court, in an opinion written by Judge John Roberts, held that the FCA did not apply to false claims submitted to Amtrak because Amtrak is not the government. Roberts justified his narrow reading by citing a book by Circuit Judge Henry Friendly. (citing Henry J. Friendly, Benchmarks (1967)). In dissent, Garland (who like Roberts had clerked for Friendly), cited Friendly's book as supporting the use of legislative intent, writing that Roberts was relying on \\"'canons' of statutory construction, which serve here as 'cannons' of statutory destruction.\\" Garland's dissent, expressing concerns that the court's ruling would impede the government's ability to pursue false claims cases against federal grantees, is credited with sparking the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, which eliminated the loophole. During confirmation hearings in 2005, Senator Chuck Grassley sharply questioned Roberts on why he hadn't adopted Garland's reading. Roberts replied, \\"Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.\\" National security During Garland's tenure, the D.C. Circuit has reviewed cases arising from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In al Odah v. United States (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees. In July 2011, Garland wrote for the unanimous panel when it rejected Guantanamo detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alawi's petition for habeas corpus.. In Parhat v. Gates (2008), Garland wrote for a unanimous panel that overturned the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's determination that a captured Uyghur was an enemy combatant. In Saleh v. Titan Corp. (2009), Garland dissented from the court's holding that former Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison could not sue private military contractors who participated in torture and prisoner abuse. Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because \\"no act of Congress and no judicial precedent\\" immunized the contractors from tort liability, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.Mark Gibney, \\"Litigating Transnational Human Rights Obligations\\" in Challenging Territoriality in Human Rights Law: Building Blocks for a Plural and Diverse Duty-Bearer Regime (Routledge, 2015: ed. Wouter Vandenhole), p. 103. First Amendment According to Goldstein, Garland has \\"tended to take a broader view\\" of First Amendment rights. In cases involving the Freedom of Information Act and similar provisions related to government transparency, \\"Judge Garland's rulings reflect a preference for open government.\\" In ACLU v. CIA (2013), Garland wrote for a unanimous panel rejecting the agency's Glomar response and ordering it to process the ACLU's FOIA request regarding targeted killings by CIA drones. In Cause of Action v. FTC (2015), Garland wrote for a unanimous panel overturning the agency's limitation on FOIA fee waivers to large news outlets. In Lee v. Department of Justice (2005), Garland dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the Wen Ho Lee investigation. Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to \\"weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure\\" and that this \\"undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'\\" In Initiative & Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature- gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment. Garland found the regulation to be facially overbroad and not narrowly tailored. In cases involving campaign finance reform laws, Garland has applied Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission when he believed that he was compelled to do so, but he has not sought to extend its holding. In Wagner v. Federal Election Commission (2015), Garland wrote for the unanimous en banc D.C. Circuit in upholding a prohibition on campaign contributions from federal contractors because of the governmental interest in preventing corruption. In National Association of Manufacturers v. Taylor (2009), Garland wrote for the court in a decision upholding the constitutionality of lobbyist disclosure requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Professor Rick Hasen, an election-law expert, writes that Garland's opinions on election law are characterized by careful application of precedent and indicate that Garland believes in reasonable regulation. Garland has addressed a number of religious freedom cases while on the D.C. Circuit, although several of these have been decided on procedural grounds. In 2002, Garland joined a unanimous court in ruling for two federal prisoners who were denied the right to consume communion wine.Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313 (D.C. Cir. 2002). In 2010, Garland wrote the decision for a unanimous court in favor of an Interior Department employee who brought a religious-discrimination claim after the Interior Department refused to allow her to work weekdays rather than Sunday, when she wished to attend church and Bible study. Second Amendment In 2007, Garland voted in favor of en banc review of the D.C. Circuit's panel decision in Parker v. District of Columbia invalidating the D.C. handgun ban. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this invalidation 5‚Äì4 in an opinion by Justice Scalia. Goldstein commented, \\"Garland did not take a formal position on the merits of the case\\" and \\"even if he had concluded that the statute was constitutional, that view of the case would have conformed\\" to widespread views under the existing Supreme Court precedent. Other cases In Alexander v. Daley (2003), Garland joined a decision (authored by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly), rejecting a challenge brought by District of Columbia residents seeking D.C. congressional voting rights. In Hutchins v. District of Columbia (1999), Garland agreed with four other D.C. Circuit judges (en banc) that D.C.'s Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 implicated at least some significant right of minors.Gabrielle M. Duvall, Recent Decisions: From Dusk Till Dawn: The D.C. Circuit's Examination of Juvenile Nocturnal Rights, 68 George Washington Law Review 710 (2000). He joined parts of a plurality opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge. Garland also joined the part of Judge Judith W. Rogers's opinion (concurring in part and dissenting in part) holding that a fundamental right to intrastate travel exists. Supreme Court nomination Garland was considered twice to fill vacated seats on the United States Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010 before finally being nominated in 2016 by President Barack Obama for the seat left vacant by the death of conservative Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.  2009 and 2010 considerations  In 2009, following the announcement by Justice David Souter that he would retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge of the Second Circuit. After the April 2010 announcement by Justice John Paul Stevens that he would retire, Garland was again widely seen as a leading contender for a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. President Obama interviewed Garland, among others, for the vacancy. In May 2010, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he would help Obama if Garland was nominated, calling Garland \\"a consensus nominee\\" and predicting that Garland would win Senate confirmation with bipartisan support. Obama nominated Solicitor General of the United States Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August 2010. Scalia vacancy and 2016 nomination Garland with Barack Obama at his Supreme Court nomination, 2016 On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died. Later that day, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement that they would not consider any nominee put forth by Obama, and that a Supreme Court nomination should be left to the next President of the United States. President Obama responded that he intended to \\"fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,\\" and that there was no \\"well established tradition\\" that a president could not fill a Supreme Court vacancy during the U.S. President's last year in office. In early March 2016, The New York Times reported that Garland was being vetted by the Obama Administration as a potential nominee. A week later, Garland was named as one of three judges on the President's \\"short list\\" (along with Judge Sri Srinivasan, also of the D.C. Circuit, and Judge Paul J. Watford of the Ninth Circuit). Obama interviewed all three leading contenders, as well as two others who were being considered: Judge Jane L. Kelly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Soon afterward, Senator Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the United States Senate and the most senior Republican Senator, predicted that President Obama would \\"name someone the liberal Democratic base wants\\" even though he \\"could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.\\" Five days later, on March 16, Obama formally nominated Garland to the vacant post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Garland had more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, and was the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1971. The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Garland \\"well- qualified\\" (the Committee's highest rating) to sit on the Supreme Court. In an unprecedented move, the Senate's Republican majority (under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) refused to consider Garland's nomination, holding \\"no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever\\" on the nomination.Nina Totenberg, 170-Plus Days And Counting: GOP Unlikely To End Supreme Court Blockade Soon, NPR, All Things Considered (September 6, 2016).Adam Liptak, Study Calls Snub of Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court Pick Unprecedented, New York Times (June 14, 2016): \\"\\"After a comprehensive look at every past Supreme Court vacancy, two law professors have concluded that it is an unprecedented development. ... That categorical stance is new in the nation's history, the professors, Robin Bradley Kar and Jason Mazzone, wrote in a study published online by The New York University Law Review.\\"\\"McConnell On Supreme Court Nomination,\\" March 16, 2016, official website of the Republican Leader of the U.S. Senate (Sen. Mitch McConnell), retrieved September 21, 2020. The refusal was highly controversial, with some commentators saying the seat on the Court to which Garland was nominated was \\"stolen\\".See, e.g.: * Michael C. Dorf, It's Not About Judge Gorsuch, Dorf on Law (January 31, 2017). * Editorial, When the GOP stole Merrick Garland's Supreme Court seat, they set the stage for a miserable battle, Los Angeles Times (January 31, 2017). * Editorial, Neil Gorsuch, the Nominee for a Stolen Seat, New York Times (January 31, 2017). * Editorial, The Stolen Supreme Court Seat, New York Times (December 24, 2016). Over 170,000 people signed a White House petition asking President Obama to independently appoint Garland to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Senate had waived its advise and consent role. On November 17, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras threw out a lawsuit against Senator McConnell seeking to compel a vote on the nomination, finding that the plaintiff, who had simply alleged he was a voter, had no standing to sue. After a period of 293 days, Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017 at the end of the 114th Congress.Jess Bravin, President Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court Nomination of Merrick Garland Expires, Wall Street Journal (January 3, 2017). On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Court vacancy. On April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court. Memberships and committee service Garland served as co-chair of the administrative law section of the District of Columbia Bar from 1991 to 1994. He is also a member of the American Law Institute. In 2003, Garland was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers, completing the unexpired term of Deval Patrick, who had stepped down from the board. Garland served as president of the overseers for 2009‚Äì10. Personal life Garland and his wife, Lynn, have been married since 1987. Lynn Garland's grandfather, Samuel Irving Rosenman, was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court) and a special counsel to presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Garland and his wife have two daughters, Rebecca and Jessica; both are graduates of Yale University. He is a second cousin of six-term Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. Garland is a resident of Bethesda, Maryland. Financial disclosure forms in 2016 indicated that Garland's net worth at the time was between $6 million and $23 million. Garland is partially colorblind so he uses a list to match his suits and ties. Selected publications * Merrick B.

It was followed by Sampras Tennis 96 for Sega's 16-bit console and later by Pete Sampras Tennis '97, released for the PlayStation and Windows/DOS. Gameplay While Pete Sampras Tennis uses all three control pad buttons, the game play remains simple yet realistic, for its time. While serving, the A button sends the ball automatically, and B allows the player to control the ball speed and direction, and is the only way to score aces against the best players. During play, A lobs, B sends a normal shot and C, if pressed alone performs a top spin shot, if in conjunction with left or right on the D-Pad the player dives in that direction. It is also possible to aim the ball by pressing any direction on the D-Pad before there is contact between the racket and the ball. Expert players are able to win against any computer player without giving a point away, since the AI isn't very well developed (and there are no difficulty options) and it's hard to miss a ball. The most usual tactic is to lure the opponent into the net (by making low shots), and then expect he bounces against a mid-height ball close to the net, or if he manages to return, call in a long lob, leaving the opponent with no chances of returning the ball. With harder-hitting characters, it is possible to make strong and accurate returns after the serve, which the computer-controlled player rarely manages to return. While managing to make perfect use of the lob and spinning shot aim is essential to play the game, top spins can be more a nuisance than helpful. Since it shares the same button as dives, and a good top spin shot requires additional power control (by either pressing up or down), Sega's 8-direction pads, if broken or dirty, or even simply if the user's finger slipped, top spin shots often ended up turning into a dive, the ball passing uselessly by the helpless player. Characters The only real tennis player is Pete Sampras. All players, however, have different ratings for base line, service, speed and volleys, and there is a noticeable difference between left- and right-handed players. Not all players can be used in the World Tour mode, as some of them are actual opponents. Events There are only three surfaces to choose from (Grass, Hard and Clay). Although the surfaces are not sufficiently differentiated to impinge on AI or player tactics, the bounce of the ball is lowest on Grass and highest on Clay, with Hard intermediate. There are several places where matches and tournaments in the Huge Tour take place, and they are accurate on the kind of surface that tournament actually uses: London (Wimbledon) is played on grass, Paris (Roland Garros) on clay, New York (Flushing Meadows) on hard court, etc. Each surface has three different sets, with the scoreboard on the left, right or middle. This is probably one indication of the court in use: most games during Huge Tour tournaments are played in the sided scoreboard courts, except the final. Game modes The game has three main modes: Challenge match, Tournament and World Tour. By inserting the Zeppelin password, two extra modes are unlocked: Crazy Tennis and Huge Tour. Main modes Challenge matches are simple head-to-head matches, where everything can be customized, from game length (1/3/5 sets), location and the kind of game (singles or doubles). All players can be chosen (including opponents in the World Tour), and if the J-Cart is in use, 4 players can play simultaneously. Tournament is the \\"party\\" mode. From four to eight players can compete head to head in a knockout competition until the best two matchup in the final. Although it is not possible to change the match length (5 sets only), each player can choose a handicap, from none to three sets. The single- player only game mode, called World Tour, is a one set only, composed by 18 rounds across the globe. Some of the players are not available (Sampras included) since they are opponents during the tournament. Since the game is easy, this mode can be beaten in few days. Extra modes Crazy Tennis is one arcade-ish mode where players get points from simply hitting the ball. There is one overall sense of wackiness in this mode, as some lower balls are blocked by a popup racket on the net, some powerups increase the size of the ball or allow direct control of its path, and there is even a cameo from Dizzy, who walks on the net and works as a pi√±ata. After five hits Dizzy breaks, giving several points to the last player who hit the ball. Players can get points from hitting the ball, breaking Dizzy and winning the point, which aggregates all the points played since the last service (which is done automatically by a machine, instead of a player). The game is timed, and both players must achieve the target score - if one of them reaches the timer without the required score, the game ends and the player with the higher score is declared winner. The Huge Tour mode is a complete competition, nearly a season simulation. There are both men, women and mixed tournaments, for the highest rewarded a minimum place in the ranking is required. So, in order to win the Australian Open (the season opener) one must first complete a season first. Up to eight players can compete at the same time, the match length is the official: five sets for men, three for women. Reception Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Pete Sampras Tennis is an action-oriented tennis game without much action.\\" References Category:1994 video games Category:Codemasters games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Tennis video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Cultural depictions of Pete Sampras ","title":"Pete Sampras Tennis"},{"id":"1110165","text":"Z100 may refer to: American radio stations known as Z100 * KKRZ in Portland, Oregon * KZOQ-FM in Missoula, Montana * KZRO in Mount Shasta, California * WBIZ-FM in Eau Claire, Wisconsin * WHTZ in Newark, New Jersey * WZJR, now WRFX, in Kannapolis, North Carolina * WZRA, now WEAN-FM, in Wakefield-Peacedale, Rhode Island * KLRZ in New Orleans, Louisiana, known as Z-100 in the 1990s Other uses * Zenith Z-100, an early microcomputer * Sendo Z100, a mobile phone model * Z100, a Shanghai‚ÄìKowloon through train See also * Zenair CH 100 ","title":"Z100"},{"id":"1110171","text":"The History of Ontario covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day. The lands that make up present-day Ontario, the most populous province of Canada as of the early 21st century have been inhabited for millennia by groups of Aboriginal people, with French and British exploration and colonization commencing in the 17th century. Before the arrival of Europeans, the region was inhabited both by Algonquian (Ojibwa, Cree and Algonquin) and Iroquoian (Iroquois, Petun and Huron) tribes. French explorer √âtienne Br√ªl√© surveyed part of the area in 1610‚Äì12. The English explorer Henry Hudson sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for England, but Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario. With their victory in the Seven Years' War, the 1763 Treaty of Paris awarded nearly all of France's North American possessions (New France) to Britain. The Constitutional Act of 1791 recognized this development, as it split Quebec Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the Act of Union (1840), with the capital at Kingston. On July 1, 1867, the Dominion of Canada was established with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. Pre 1790s Province of Quebec in 1774 Before the arrival of Europeans, the region was inhabited both by Algonquian (Ojibwa, Cree and Algonquin) and Iroquoian (Iroquois, Petun and Huron) tribes. French explorer √âtienne Br√ªl√© surveyed part of the area in 1610‚Äì12. The English explorer Henry Hudson sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for England, but Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615. French Jesuit missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes, forging alliances in particular with the Huron people. Permanent French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Five Nations of the Iroquois (based in New York State), who became allied with the British. By the early 1650s, using both British and Dutch arms, they had succeeded in pushing other related Iroquoian- speaking peoples, the Petun and Neutral Nation, out of or to the fringes of territorial southern Ontario. In 1747 a small number of French settlers established the oldest continually inhabited European community in what became western Ontario; Petite C√¥te was settled on the south bank of the Detroit River across from Fort Detroit and near Huron and Petun villages. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario. With their victory in the Seven Years' War, the 1763 Treaty of Paris awarded nearly all of France's North American possessions (New France) to Britain. The region was annexed to Quebec in 1774. The first English settlements were in 1782‚Äì1784, when 5,000 American loyalists entered what is now Ontario following the American Revolution.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1911) From 1783 to 1796, Britain granted individuals 200 acres (0.8 km2) of land per household and other items as compensation for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies and a start for rebuilding their lives. This resettlement substantially increased the European population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence during this period. 1791‚Äì1867 Upper Canada in orange The Constitutional Act of 1791 recognized this development, as it split Quebec into The Canadas: Lower Canada east of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, the area of earliest settlement; and Upper Canada southwest of the confluence. John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor in 1793. Upper Canada War of 1812 American troops in the War of 1812 invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the Detroit River but were defeated and pushed back by British forces, local militia and allied Native American forces. The Americans gained control of Lake Erie at the Battle of Lake Erie. The British had to flee on foot, and the American William Henry Harrison caught up and decisively defeated them at the Battle of the Thames. The Americans also killed Tecumseh, leader of the anti-American First Nations military force, which permanently disrupted the military alliance between Britain and the Indians. During the Battle of York, Americans occupied the Town of York (later named Toronto) in 1813. After losing their general Zebulon Pike and having a difficult time holding the town, the departing American soldiers burned it to the ground. Transportation The Welland canal around Niagara Falls has been modernized often since it opened in 1829. After the War of 1812, relative stability attracted increasing numbers of immigrants from Britain and Ireland rather than from the United States. Colonial leaders encouraged this new immigration. However, many arriving newcomers from Europe (mostly from Britain and Ireland) found frontier life difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. But population growth far exceeded emigration from this area in the following decades. Canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving relations over time. Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. Canals were capital-intensive infrastructure projects that facilitated trade. The Oswego Canal, built in New York 1825‚Äì1829, was a vital commercial link in the Great Lakes‚ÄìAtlantic seaway. It was connected to Ontario's Welland Canal in 1829. The newly fashioned Oswego‚ÄìWelland line offered an alternate route to the St. Lawrence River and Europe, as opposed to the Erie Canal, which connected the Great Lakes to New York City via the Mohawk and Hudson rivers.Janet Larkin, \\"The Oswego Canal: A Connecting Link Between The United States and Canada, 1819‚Äì1837\\", Ontario History, Spring 2011, Vol. 103 Issue 1, pp 23‚Äì41 Family Compact In the absence of a hereditary aristocracy, Upper Canada was run by an oligarchy or closed group of powerful men who controlled most of the political, judicial and economic power from the 1810s to the 1830s. Opponents called it the \\"Family Compact\\", but its members avoided the term. In the religious sphere, a key leader was John Strachan (1778‚Äì1867), the Anglican bishop of Toronto. Strachan (and the Family Compact generally) was opposed by Methodist leader Egerton Ryerson (1803‚Äì1882). The Family Compact consisted of English gentry who arrived before 1800, and the sons of United Empire Loyalists, who were exiles who fled the American revolution. The term \\"family\\" was metaphorical, for they generally were not related by blood or marriage. There were no elections and the leadership controlled appointments, so local officials were generally allies of the leaders.Peter A. Baskerville, \\"Entrepreneurship and the Family Compact: York-Toronto, 1822‚Äì55\\", Urban History Review Feb 1981, Vol. 9 Issue 3, pp 15‚Äì34 The Family Compact looked to Britain for the ideal model of society, where landed aristocrats held power. The Family Compact was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy, especially the rowdy United States version. They developed the theme that they and their militia had defeated American attempts to annex Canada in the War of 1812. They were based in Toronto, and were integrated with the bankers, merchants and financiers of the city, and were active in promoting canals and railroads. Rebellion Many men chafed against the anti-democratic Family Compact that governed through personal connections among the elite, which controlled the best lands. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie led the Upper Canada Rebellion. The rebellions failed but there were long-term changes that resolved the issue.Christopher J. Anstead and Nancy B. Bouchier, \\"The 'Tombstone Affair', 1845: Woodstock Tories and Cultural Change\\", Ontario History, December 1994, Vol. 86 Issue 4, pp 363‚Äì381 Canada West Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes of the unrest. He recommended that self-government be granted and that Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the Act of Union (1840), with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West. Parliamentary self- government was granted in 1848. Due to waves of increased immigration in the 1840s, the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power. An economic boom in the 1850s, brought on by factors such as a free trade agreement with the United States, coincided with massive railway expansion across the province, furthering the economic strength of Central Canada, pre-confederation. From 1867 to 1896 Confederation A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided at this point into Ontario and Quebec so that each major European linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the relative Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time. A poster from 1878 encouraging immigration to Ontario Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the Liberal Party leader Oliver Mowat became premier, and remained as premier until 1896, despite Conservative control in Ottawa. Mowat fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than Prime Minister John A. Macdonald had intended. Mowat consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought tenaciously to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called Empire Ontario. The boundary between Ontario and Manitoba became a hotly contested matter, with the federal government attempting to extend Manitoba's jurisdiction eastward to the Great Lakes, into the areas claimed by Ontario. In 1882 Premier Mowat threatened to pull Ontario from Confederation over the issue. Mowat sent police into the disputed territory to assert Ontario's claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same.John Ibbitson, Loyal No More: Ontario's Struggle for a Separate Destiny (2001) p. 46. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, serving as Canada's highest appeal court, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights. These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a more decentralized federation. John Ibbitson writes that by 1914: :Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald's worst nightmare. Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes‚Äîeven income taxes, in a few cases‚Äîexploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.Ibbitson, p. 49 Meanwhile, Ontario's Conservative Party leader William Ralph Meredith had difficulty balancing the province's particular interests with his national party's centralism. Meredith was further undercut by lack of support from the national Conservative party and his own elitist aversion to popular politics at the provincial level.Peter E. Dembski, \\"Political History from the Opposition Benches: William Ralph Meredith, Ontario Federalist\\", Ontario History, September 1997, Vol. 89 Issue 3, pp 199‚Äì217 In the 1894 election, the main issues were the Liberals' \\"Ontario System\\", as well as opposition to French language schools and a rise in anti-Catholicism (led by the Protestant Protective Association (PPA));James T. Watt, \\"Anti-Catholicism in Ontario Politics: The Role of the Protestant Protective Association in the 1894 Election\\", Ontario History, November 1967, Vol. 59 Issue 2, pp 57‚Äì67 farmer interests as expressed by the new Patrons of Industry; support for Toronto business, woman suffrage, and the temperance movement; and the demands of labour unions. Mowat and the Liberals maintained their large majority in the assembly.Janet B. Kerr, \\"Sir Oliver Mowat and the Campaign of 1894\\", Ontario History, March 1963, Vol. 55 Issue 1, pp 1‚Äì13 Economic development Transportation As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the 19th century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts, and communications.Virtual Vault , an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada Ontario large manufacturing and finance sectors waxed profitable in the late 19th century. Lucrative new markets opened up nationwide thanks to the federal government's high-tariff National Policy after 1879, which limited competition from the United States. New markets out west opened after construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875‚Äì1885) through Northern Ontario to the Prairies and British Columbia. Tens of thousands of European immigrants, as well as native Canadians, moved west along the railroad in order to acquire land and set up new farms. They shipped their wheat east and bought from local merchants who placed orders with Ontario wholesalers, especially those based in Toronto. Farming Farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896. The major changes involved mechanization of technology and a shift toward high-profit, high-quality consumer products, such as milk, eggs and vegetables, for the fast-growing urban markets.D. A. Lawr, \\"The Development of Ontario Farming, 1870‚Äì1914: Patterns of Growth and Change\\", Ontario History, (1972) 64#3 pp 239‚Äì251 It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943‚Äì52, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production.Ian A. McKay, \\"A Note on Ontario Agriculture: The Development of Soybeans, 1893‚Äì1952\\", Ontario History, June 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 175‚Äì186 Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques. Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which developed as the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph in 1874.John Carter, \\"The Education of the Ontario Farmer\\", Ontario History, May 2004, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp 62‚Äì84 Commercial wine production in the province began in the 1860s with an aristocrat from France, Count Justin McCarthy De Courtenay in County Peel. His success followed the realization that the right grapes could grow in the cold climate, producing an inexpensive good wine that could reach a commercial market. He gained government support and raised the capital for a commercial-scale vineyard and winery. His financial success encouraged others to enter the business.Richard Jarrell, \\"Justin De Courtenay and the Birth of the Ontario Wine Industry\\", Ontario History, Spring 2011, Vol. 103 Issue 1, pp 81‚Äì104 Social welfare The care of illegitimate children was a high priority for private charities. Before 1893, the Ontario government appropriated grants to charitable infants' homes for the infants and for their nursing mothers. Most of these infants were illegitimate, and most of their mothers were poor. Many babies were admitted to the homes in poor physical condition, so that their chances of survival outside such homes was poor.Charlotte Neff, \\"Ontario Government Funding and Supervision of Infants' Homes 1875‚Äì1893\\", Journal of Family History (2013) 38#1 pp 17‚Äì54. Culture Religion The changes in the next generation in the town of Woodstock in southwestern Ontario exemplified the shift of power from the Tory elite to middle-class merchants and professionals. The once-unquestioned leadership of the magistracy and the Anglican Church, with their closed interlocking networks of patron-client relations, faded year by year as modern ideas of respectability based on merit and economic development grew apace. The new middle class was solidly in control by the 1870s, and the old elite had all but vanished.Anstead and Bouchier, The 'Tombstone Affair', 1845: Woodstock Tories and Cultural Change, pp 363‚Äì381 While Anglicans consolidated their hold on the upper classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851‚Äì53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.Peter Bush, \\"The Reverend James Caughey and Wesleyan Methodist Revivalism in Canada West, 1851‚Äì1856\\", Ontario History, September 1987, Vol. 79 Issue 3, pp 231‚Äì250 Sport and recreation Travelers commented on the class differentials in recreation, contrasting the gentrified masculinity of the British middle class and the rough-and-ready bush masculinity of the workers. Working-class audiences responded to cockfights, boxing matches, wrestling, and animal baiting. That was too bloody for gentlemen and army officers, who favoured games that promoted honour and built character. Middle-class sports, especially lacrosse and snowshoeing, evolved from military training. Ice hockey proved a success among both refined gentlemen and bloodthirsty labourers.Greg Gillespie, \\"Sport and 'Masculinities' in Early-Nineteenth-Century Ontario: The British Travellers' Image\\", Ontario History, (2000) 92#2 pp 113‚Äì126 The ideals promulgated by English author and reformer Thomas Hughes, especially as expressed in Tom Brown's Schooldays (1857), gave the middle class a model for sports that provided moral education and training for citizenship. Late in the 19th century, the Social Gospel themes of muscular Christianity were influential, as in the invention of basketball in 1891 by James Naismith, an Ontarian employed at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School in Massachusetts. Outside of sports, the social and moral agendas behind muscular Christianity influenced numerous reform movements, thus linking it to the political left in Canada.Bruce Kidd, \\"Muscular Christianity and Value-centred Sport: the Legacy of Tom Brown in Canada\\", International Journal of the History of Sport, (2006) 23#4, pp 701‚Äì713 Medicine Numerous local rivalries had to be overcome before physicians could form a single, self-regulating, and unified medical body for licensing and educating practitioners.Rainer Baehre, The Medical Profession in Upper Canada' Reconsidered: Politics, Medical Reform, and Law in a Colonial Society\\", Canadian Bulletin of Medical History, 1995, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp 101‚Äì124 Professionalization began with the first medical board in 1818, and an 1827 act that required all doctors to be licensed. From the 1840s on, the number of new doctors with medical degrees increased rapidly because of legislation and the establishment of local medical schools. The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons was chartered in 1869.Terrie M. Romano, \\"Professional Identity and the Nineteenth-Century Ontario Medical Profession\\", Histoire Sociale: Social History, May 1995, Vol. 28 Issue 55, pp 77‚Äì98 As physicians became better organized, they gained passage of laws controlling the practice of medicine and pharmacy, and banning marginal and traditional practitioners. Midwifery‚Äîpractised along traditional lines by women‚Äîwas restricted and practically died out by 1900.C. Lesley Biggs, \\"The Case of the Missing Midwives: A History of Midwifery in Ontario from 1795‚Äì1900\\", Ontario History, March 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 1, pp 21‚Äì35 Even so, the great majority of childbirths took place at home until the 1920s, when hospitals became preferred, especially by women who were better educated, wealthier and more modern, and more trusting of modern medicine.Jo Oppenheimer, \\"Childbirth in Ontario: The Transition from Home to Hospital in the Early Twentieth Century\\", Ontario History, March 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 1, pp 36‚Äì60 Since 1896 Economic growth Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast like Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. Energy policy focused on hydro-electric power, leading to the formation in 1906 of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEPC), renamed Ontario Hydro in 1974. HEPC was a unique hybrid of a government department, a crown corporation, and a municipal cooperative that coexisted with the existing private companies. It was a \\"politically rational\\" rather than a \\"technically efficient\\" solution that depended on the watershed election of 1905 when the main issue became \\"Niagara Power\\". The Conservative slogan was \\"water power of Niagara should be free\\".\\"Niagara Falls History of Power\\", Niagara Frontier The Conservatives replaced the Liberals and set up HEPC. In 1908 HEPC began purchasing electricity from Niagara Falls. In the next decade it purchased most of the privately owned distribution systems and built an integrated network. The availability of cheap electric power stimulated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904. General Motors of Canada Ltd. was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry became by 1920 the most productive industry in Ontario and a customer for smaller suppliers. Entrepreneurship was exemplified by the career of John Northway (1848‚Äì1926). Beginning as a tailor in a small town, he moved to Toronto and soon developed a chain of department stores. His innovations in the sewing and marketing of ladies' wear stimulated the rise of a Canadian ladies' garment industry. Northway pioneered modern business and accounting methods. He innovated as well in labour relations, as a pioneer in sickness and accident compensation and profit-sharing schemes. A millionaire by 1910, he played a leading role in Toronto's civic life. Modernizing medicine Once they had taken control of the practice of medicine, the doctors on the Medical Council of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) turned their attention to the quality of medical education in the province. Marginal and untrained practitioners were banned, but the question rose of the permanence and the quality of proprietary for-profit medical schools. CPSO-imposed regulations in the 1860s to increase faculty size and raise matriculation standards. They required students to take Council-administered examinations. Toronto had two medical schools ‚Äì Trinity Medical School and the Toronto School of Medicine (TSM). During the 1880s the TSM added instructors, expanded its curriculum, and focused on clinical instruction. Enrollments grew at both schools. Critics found proprietary schools lacking, especially for their failure to offer sufficient instruction in the basic sciences. In 1887, the TSM became the medical faculty of the University of Toronto, increasing its emphasis on research within the medical curriculum. Trinity realized that its survival depended as well on close ties to basic science, and in 1904 it also merged into the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.R. D. Gidney, and W. P. J. Millar, \\"The Reorientation of Medical Education in Late Nineteenth-Century Ontario: The Proprietary Medical Schools and the Founding of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto\\", Journal of the History of Medicine & Allied Sciences, January 1994, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 52‚Äì78 In 1923 University of Toronto researchers J. J. R. Macleod (1876‚Äì1935) and Frederick Banting (1891‚Äì1941) won the Nobel Pr1ze in Medicine for their 1921 discovery of insulin, putting Toronto on the world map of leading science.\\"Sir Frederick Grant Banting\\", The Canadian EncyclopediaJ. M. Fenster, \\"The Conquest of Diabetes\\", American Heritage of Invention & Technology, January 1999, Vol. 14 Issue 3, pp 48‚Äì55 Legal reform The construction of roads and canals depended on numerous workers, whose wages often went to liquor, gambling and women, all causes for fighting and rowdiness. Community leaders realized the traditional method of dealing with troublemakers one by one was inadequate, and they began to adopt less personal modernized procedures that followed imperial models of policing, trial, and punishment through the courts.John Weaver, \\"Crime, Public Order, and Repression: The Gore District in Upheaval, 1832‚Äì1851\\", Ontario History, September 1986, Vol. 78 Issue 3, pp 175‚Äì207 Boer War, Yonge Street, Toronto, 31 May 1900 Modernizing the police Toronto, Hamilton, Berlin (Kitchener), Windsor and other cities modernized and professionalized their public services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No service was changed more dramatically than the police. The introduction of emergency telephone call boxes linked to a central dispatcher, plus the use of bicycles, motorcycles and automobiles, shifted the patrolman's duties from passively walking the beat to fast reaction to reported incidents, as well as handling automobile traffic. After 1930 the introduction of police radios speeded response times.Bill Rawling, \\"Technology and Innovation in the Toronto Police Force, 1875‚Äì1925\\", Ontario History, March 1988, Vol. 80 Issue 1, pp 53‚Äì71 Language war and school crisis Regulation 17 was a regulation of the Conservative government designed to shut down French-language schools at a time that Francophones from Quebec were moving into eastern Ontario.Robert Craig Brown, and Ramsay Cook, Canada, 1896‚Äì1921: A Nation Transformed (1974), pp 253‚Äì262 In July 1912, the Conservative government of Sir James P. Whitney issued Regulation 17, which severely limited the provision of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and after that students and teachers were required to use English in classrooms. Few of the teachers at the French- language schools were fluent in English, so the schools had to close. The French-Canadian population, which was growing rapidly in eastern Ontario from migration, reacted with outrage; journalist Henri Bourassa denounced the \\"Prussians of Ontario\\". With the Great War raging, Anglophones were insulted by the comparison. The restriction on French- language schools contributed to the Francophones turning away from the war effort in 1915 and refusing to enlist. But, most of Ontario's Catholics were Irish, led by Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. The government repealed Regulation 17 in 1927.Jack D. Cecillon, Prayers, Petitions, and Protests: The Catholic Church and the Ontario Schools Crisis in the Windsor Border Region, 1910‚Äì1928 (2013) Conservation and heritage museums The preservation of natural resources began with the passage of the Public Parks Act in 1883, which called for public parks in every town and city. Algonquin Provincial Park, the first provincial park, was established in 1893. The creation of the provincial Department of Planning and Development in 1944 brought conservation offices throughout the province and made for an integrated approach. The conservation authorities started to create heritage museums, but that ended in the 1970s when responsibility was shifted to the new ministry of Culture and Recreation. Repeated budget cuts in the 1980s and 1990s reduced the operation of many museums and historical sites.John C. Carter, \\"Ontario Conservation Authorities: Their Heritage Resources and Museums\\", Ontario History, May 2002, Vol. 94 Issue 1, pp 5‚Äì28 World War I The British element strongly supported the war with men, money and enthusiasm. So too did the Francophone element until it reversed position in 1915. Given Germany as one of the Axis Powers, the Canadian government was suspicious of the loyalty of residents of German descent, and anti-German sentiment escalated in the country. The City of Berlin was renamed Kitchener after Britain's top commander. Left-wing anti-war activists also came under attack. In 1917‚Äì18 Isaac Bainbridge of Toronto, the dominion secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Canada and editor of its newspaper, Canadian Forward, was charged three times with seditious libel and once with possession of seditious material; he was imprisoned twice. Prohibition Starting in the late 1870s the Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) urged public schools to teach \\"scientific temperance\\" as a compulsory subject; it reinforced moralistic messages with the study of anatomy and hygiene. Although the WCTU was initially successful in convincing the Ontario Department of Education to adopt scientific temperance as part of the curriculum, teachers opposed the plan and refused to implement it. The WCTU reacted with an attempt to reduce alcohol sales and use in the province through government action. They started with \\"local option\\" laws, which allowed local governments to prohibit the sale of liquor. Many towns and rural areas went dry in the years before 1914, but not the larger cities.Sharon Anne Cook, \\"'Earnest Christian Women, Bent on Saving our Canadian Youth': The Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Scientific Temperance Instruction, 1881‚Äì1930\\", Ontario History, September 1994, Vol. 86 Issue 3, pp 249‚Äì267 Anti-German sentiment after 1914 and the accession of Conservative William Hearst to the premiership made prohibition a major political issue, as many residents associated beer production and drinking with Germans. The Methodists and Baptists (but not the Anglicans or Catholics) demanded the province be made dry. The government introduced prohibition of alcoholic sales in 1916 with the Ontario Temperance Act. However, drinking itself was never illegal, and residents could distill and retain their own personal supply. As major liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, Ontario became a centre for the illegal smuggling of liquor into the United States. The latter passed complete prohibition, effective after 1920. The \\"drys\\" won a referendum in 1919. Prohibition was ended in 1927 with the Conservative establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.Brian Douglas Tennyson, \\"Sir William Hearst and the Ontario Temperance Act\\", Ontario History, Dec 1963, Vol. 55 Issue 4, pp 233‚Äì245 In the early 21st century, the government still controls the sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer to ensure compliance with strict community standards and to generate revenue from the alcohol retail monopoly. In April 2007, Ontario Minister of Provincial Parliament Kim Craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier Dalton McGuinty. 1920s Premier Hearst had a number of progressive ideas planned for his next term, but his Conservatives were swept from power in 1919 by a totally new farmer's party. The United Farmers of Ontario, with 45 seats, formed a bare majority coalition with the trades union party, known as the \\"Ontario Independent Labour Party\\", with 11 seats. They selected farm leader Ernest Drury as premier, enforced prohibition, passed a mother's pension and minimum wage which Hearst had proposed, and promoted good roads in the rural areas. The farmers and unionists did not get along well. The 1923 election reflected a popular move to the right, with the Conservatives winning 50% of the vote and 75 seats of the 111 seats, making George Howard Ferguson premier.Randall White, Ontario: 1610‚Äì1985 (1985) pp 213‚Äì217 When surveys of public health showed infant mortality rates were high in Ontario, particularly in the more rural and isolated areas, the provincial government teamed with middle-class public health reformers to take action. They launched an educational campaign to teach mothers to save and improve the lives of infants and young children, with the long-range goal of uplifting the average Canadian family.Cynthia Comacchio Abeele, The Mothers of the Land Must Suffer': Child And Maternal Welfare in Rural and Outpost Ontario, 1918‚Äì1940\\", Ontario History, September 1988, Vol. 80 Issue 3, pp 183‚Äì205 Great Depression Agriculture and industry alike suffered in the Great Depression in Canada; hardest hit were the lumbering regions, the auto plants, and the steel mills. The milk industry suffered from price wars that hurt both dairy farmers and dairies. The government set up the Ontario Milk Control Board (MCB), which raised and stabilized prices through licensing, bonding, and fixed price agreements. The MCB resolved the crisis for the industry, but consumers complained loudly about higher prices. The government favoured producers over consumers as the industry rallied behind the MCB.Andrew Ebejer, Milking' the Consumer?\\" Ontario History, Spring 2010, Vol. 102 Issue 1, pp 20‚Äì39 Following a massive defeat in 1934 by the Liberals, the Conservatives reorganized over the next decade. Led by pragmatic leaders Cecil Frost, George Drew, Alex McKenzie, and Fred Gardiner, they minimized internal conflicts, quietly dropped laissez-faire positions, and opted in favor of state intervention to deal with the Great Depression and encourage economic growth. The revised party declared loyalty to the Empire, called for comprehensive health care and pension programs, and sought more provincial autonomy. The reforms set the stage for a long run of election wins from 1943 onward.Keith Brownsey, \\"Opposition Blues: Leadership, Policy, and Organization in the Ontario Conservative Party, 1934‚Äì43\\", Ontario History, Nov 1996, Vol. 88 Issue 4, pp 273‚Äì296 Postwar Celebrating V-E Day in Ottawa in 1945 The post-World War II period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario, and the Greater Toronto Area in particular, have been the destination of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from post-war Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. After changes in federal immigration law, since the 1970s there has been a massive influx of non- Europeans. In terms of ancestry, Ontario has changed from a largely ethnically British province, to one that is very diverse. Women's labour laws Ontario's Fair Employment Practices Act combatted racist and religious discrimination after the Second World War, but it did not cover gender issues. Most human rights activists did not raise the issue before the 1970s, because they were family oriented and subscribed to the deeply embedded ideology of the family wage, whereby the husband should be paid enough so the wife could be a full-time housewife. After lobbying by women, labour unions, and the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the Conservative government passed the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act in 1951. It required equal pay for women who did the same work as men. Feminists in the 1950s and 1960s were unsuccessful trying to gain passage of a law to prohibit other forms of sex discrimination, such as in hiring and promotion. The enforcement of both acts was constrained by their conciliatory framework. Provincial officials interpreted the equal pay act quite narrowly, and were significantly more diligent in tackling racist and religious employment discrimination.Ruth A.

MacDonald, \\"Ontario's Political Culture: Conservatism with a Progressive Component\\", Ontario History, (1994) 86#4 pp 297‚Äì317 By contrast the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), which rebranded itself as the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961, was in the doldrums after the war. Its best showing was in 1948 when it elected 21 MPPs, and formed the official opposition. Purists said its decline resulted from a loss of Socialist purity and abandonment of the founding left-wing principles of the movement and party. They said democratic socialist activity in terms of activism, youth training, and volunteerism was lost in favour of authoritarian political bureaucracy. Moderates said the decline demonstrated the need for cooperation with Liberals. Political scientists said the party lacked the more coherent organizational base it needed to survive.Dan Azoulay, A Desperate Holding Action': The Survival of the Ontario CCF/NDP, 1948‚Äì1964\\", Ontario History, (1993) 85#1 pp 17‚Äì42 The NDP routinely captured 20-some percent of the vote. In its surprise win in 1990, the NDP took 38% of the vote, won 75 of the 120 seats, and formed a government under Bob Rae. He served as premier but Ontario's labour unions, the backbone of the NDP, were outraged when Rae imposed pay cuts on unionized public workers. The NDP was defeated in 1995, falling back to 21% of the vote. Rae quit the NDP in 1998, describing it as too leftist, and joined the Liberals.Bob Rae, From Protest to Power: Personal Reflections on a Life in Politics (1996) The Ontario Retirement Pension Plan was passed by the Liberals and will start operations in 2017. It is intended to cover an estimated 3.5 million workers in Ontario who do not have workplace pension plans. It is designed to supplement the Canada Pension Plan, and provide up to 15 per cent of a retiree's pre-retirement income as an annual pension.Kershaw, Paul, and C. P. A. Lynell Anderson. \\"Ontario Election 2014 Study\\". (2014). online Toronto as business centre Toronto replaced Montreal as the nation's premier business centre because the nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly with the success of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1976, systematically drove Anglophone business away. Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario. Ontario has no official language, but English is considered the de facto language. Numerous French language services are available under the French Language Services Act of 1990 in designated areas where sizable francophone populations exist. Roads and travel The rapid spread of automobiles after 1910 and the building of roads, especially after 1920, opened up opportunities in remote rural areas to travel to the towns and cities for shopping and services. City people moved outward to suburbs. By the 1920s it was common for city folk to have a vacation cottage in remote lake areas.

The MTR Corporation runs Hong Kong's eponymous Mass Transit Railway (MTR), and is also a major property developer and landlord in Hong Kong. The MTR additionally invests in railways across different parts in the world, including franchised contracts to operate rapid transit systems in London, Sweden (Stockholm Metro and the MTRX Stockholm-Gothenburg rail link), Beijing, Hangzhou, Macau, Shenzhen, Melbourne, and Sydney. History The Mass Transit Railway Corporation () was established on 22 September 1972 as a government-owned statutory corporation to build and operate a mass transit railway system to meet Hong Kong's public transport needs. On 30 June 2000 the MTRC was succeeded by the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL, ). As with the MTRC, the MTRCL's principal business is to operate the mass transit railway system. Following a successful initial public offering, the MTRCL was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 5 October 2000, however the government is still the majority stakeholder in the MTRCL. Partial privatisation On 11 September 2000, the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Government, Mr Donald Tsang, announced the partial privatisation of MTR Corporation Limited. The offering was for one billion shares, but this was increased to 1.15 billion due to high demand. On 5 October 2000, the company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with 600,000 shareholders. In June 2001, MTR was added to the Hang Seng Index. At the time of the initial public offering, the company was operating with a budget surplus of HK$360 million (US$46.1 million), which had increased from a surplus of HK$278 million (US$35.6 million) in 1997. The MTR has continued to be one of the few profitable public transport systems in the world. MTR-KCR merger Railway network after merger Ticket gates at key interchange stations have been removed one year after the merger There had been some discussion of merging the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), which was also government-owned, and the MTR to make the territory's transport system more efficient. The MTRCL backed such a merge while the KCRC opposed the plan. In March 2004, the Hong Kong Government officially encouraged the two companies to merge. On 11 April 2006, the Hong Kong Government officially announced the details of the proposed merger. Under the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding the Government has signed with KCRC, KCRC would grant a Service Concession to the MTRCL to operate the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway (KCR) system, with an initial period of 50 years. The KCRC would receive a one-time upfront payment of HK$4.25 billion, a fixed annual payment of HK$750 million and a variable annual payment based on revenues generated from operation of the KCR system. In addition, MTRCL would make a payment of $7.79 billion for the acquisition of property and other related commercial interests. The KCRC's lines were less profitable than those of the MTRC, and the KCRC was less active in property development. It was widely considered that the Government's choice was to avoid being criticised for selling assets of the KCRC, which it wholly owned, to MTRCL for an unreasonably low price. Leasing the operation rights of the KCR system to the MTRCL avoided actually selling the KCRC. On 2 December 2007, the Chinese name of the MTRCL was changed to È¶ôÊ∏ØÈêµË∑ØÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏ (literal translation: Hong Kong Railway Corporation Limited) after being granted the Service Concession while the English name will remain unchanged. (Comparing with the Chinese version) (Comparing with the Chinese version ) The KCRC is now a holding company of the KCR system, without actual railway operations. The merger was approved by shareholders of the MTRCL on 9 October 2007. The merger is effective for 50 years. This also resulted in changing the system's Chinese name from \\"Âú∞Èêµ\\" (\\"Subway\\") to \\"Ê∏ØÈêµ\\" \\"(Hong Kong Railway\\"). All adult Octopus Card holders would be the first to benefit from the merger.Railway Merger Proposal in Hong Kong Gets Green Light, Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in United States. Student and Concessionary Octopus holders would also benefit from the merger by further reducing $0.1 from their 50% off fares.Fact Sheet (Eng), Merger of the MTR and KCR systems. Student Octopus holders would continue to pay the current reduced concessionary fares on the MTR network. Elderly Octopus holders would be introduced to a new fare system which only the elderly can enjoy a $2 fare to anywhere on the MTR network (excluding Airport Express, Light Rail, and Cross-Boundary Stations).Elders ride on the MTR on Sundays and public holidays for just $2 for the whole journey. Operations by market Hong Kong World Wide House, built by the MTR Corporation Limited. MTR Corporation is responsible for the operation of MTR (and the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway since 2 December 2007). The rail lines are profitable, but the MTR Corporation derives most of its profits from property development (usually adjacent to railway stations) and other commercial activities in Hong Kong, including the letting of retail and poster advertising space, ATM banking facilities, and personal telecommunication services. Rail services Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is the rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong. Originally opened in 1979, the system currently (at August 2018) includes of rail with 159 stations, including 91 railway stations and 68 light rail stops. There are also several future projects of the MTR.

The image shows an MTR Vibrant Express train at Guangzhou South railway station Property management Property is one of the main businesses of the MTR generating most of the profits. In 2009 of a net profit of HK$7.3 billion, MTR made HK$3.55 billion from property and HK$2.12 billion from transport operations. The MTR tries to develop suitable sites related to their new railway projects and their existing railway. For instance, the reclaimed land situated in West Kowloon that is owned by the MTR will be developed into an area with residential, office and retail space. Two of Hong Kong's largest banks, HSBC and the Bank of China are to have office towers there. Furthermore, will be more than 7,000 housing units in the development. The MTR also owns several shopping centres, as well as the International Finance Centre. =Shopping centres= The MTR Corporation invested heavily to develop large shopping centres around MTR stations. The most recent example is the PopCorn mall located at Tseung Kwan O station. It is connected to the adjacent malls, high- end housing and hotels. Another example of such a shopping centre is Maritime Square () located at Tsing Yi station. Maritime Square is a nautical-themed mall in which there are supermarkets, boutiques, bookstores, a cinema, and restaurants. Since Tsing Yi station serves as the transportation hub for Tsing Yi, Maritime Square is also easily accessible by other transportation means including buses and taxis. Other shopping centres developed and managed by the corporation include Elements, Paradise Mall, Telford Plaza, Luk Yeung Galleria and The Lane.

January 6, 2009) was an American guitarist, bassist and co-songwriter with Iggy Pop for the rock band the Stooges. He formed the Stooges along with Pop and his brother, drummer Scott Asheton, and bassist Dave Alexander. Asheton, once ranked as number 29 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time is currently (as of December 2015) ranked at number 60.  Early life  Asheton was born in Washington, D.C. He already had five years of practice on the accordion behind him when he began playing bass guitar at age 10. When he was 13, the family relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He and his brother Scott attended Pioneer High School. He played guitar with some local bands including the Prime Movers and The Chosen Few (briefly overlapping with James Williamson, later of the Stooges). He met Iggy Pop soon after and they formed the hard rock band the Stooges. The Stooges By 1967 Asheton was jamming with his brother Scott and friend Dave Alexander. They were soon joined by James \\"Iggy\\" Osterberg who remembered Asheton from the Chosen Few. The \\"Psychedelic Stooges\\" played their first show Halloween 1967. In 1968 they were signed to Elektra Records along with MC5 by Danny Fields. He played guitar on and wrote most of the music for their first two albums, debut album The Stooges (1969) and Fun House (1970). Shortly after recording Fun House, a second guitarist was added to the band, initially former roadie Billy Cheetham, who was shortly thereafter replaced by James Williamson. Infighting between Asheton and Williamson, whom he saw as usurping his role as songwriter and lead guitarist, as well as the toll of extensive drug use, caused the band to break up in 1971. In 1972 David Bowie invited Pop and Williamson to London to reform the band and record a new album. Eventually, after being unable to find suitable local replacements, Pop invited the Asheton brothers to rejoin but with Ron on bass, a role Ron accepted only begrudgingly. The resulting album, Raw Power, sold poorly initially, but has since been seen as a seminal album in the development of what would later be called punk rock. Tensions and drug use had not gone away during the brief reunion, however, and the band would disintegrate again in February, 1974. Several more releases continued sporadically during the next several decades, mostly recordings of live shows, album remixes, and collections of unreleased recordings, but the Stooges would not tour or record again during the 20th century. When the Stooges reformed in 2003 he once again appeared as the band's guitarist. He stayed with the band until his death and was replaced by Williamson. Other work Ron Asheton playing at Sziget Festival Apart from The Stooges, Asheton also played in the bands The New Order (not the UK band New Order), Destroy All Monsters, Dark Carnival, New Race and The Empty Set. More recently he played with Wylde Ratttz, a band composed of some of punk and alt-rock's most renowned and respected musicians. The band included Mike Watt of Minutemen, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. It contributed a cover version of the Stooges song \\"T.V. Eye\\" to the soundtrack for the Todd Haynes film Velvet Goldmine, which starred Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Asheton's final song \\"3 Stooges\\" appeared during the credits of the 2012 comedy film The Three Stooges. Asheton also acted, appearing with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre star Gunnar Hansen in Mosquito, which was released 1995. He also appeared in two other films: Frostbiter: Wrath of the Wendigo and Legion of the Night. Death Asheton was found dead in his bed by police at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the early hours of January 6, 2009, apparently having died of a heart attack a couple of days earlier. Police were summoned to Asheton's house by his personal assistant, who had been unable to reach him for several days. Sonic Youth's album The Eternal is dedicated to him. His brother Scott died on March 15, 2014, also from a heart attack. On July 17, 2018 for what would have been Asheton's 70th birthday a tribute concert was held in his hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan featuring Mike Watt, Dinosaur Jr‚Äôs J Mascis, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and Free Kitten, Mark Arm of Mudhoney, Jennifer Herrema of Royal Trux, Mario Rubalcaba of Hot Snakes, and Don Fleming of Gumball.

The most common form of plastoquinone, known as PQ-A or PQ-9, is a 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone molecule with a side chain of nine isoprenyl units. There are other forms of plastoquinone, such as ones with shorter side chains like PQ-3 (which has 3 isoprenyl side units instead of 9) as well as analogs such as PQ-B, PQ-C, and PQ-D, which differ in their side chains. The benzoquinone and isoprenyl units are both nonpolar, anchoring the molecule within the inner section of a lipid bilayer, where the hydrophobic tails are usually found. Plastoquinones are very structurally similar to ubiquinone, or coenzyme Q10, differing by the length of the isoprenyl side chain, replacement of the methoxy groups with methyl groups, and removal of the methyl group in the 2 position on the quinone. Like ubiquinone, it can come in several oxidation states: plastoquinone, plastosemiquinone (unstable), and plastoquinol, which differs from plastoquinone by having two hydroxyl groups instead of two carbonyl groups. Plastoquinol, the reduced form, also functions as an antioxidant by reducing reactive oxygen species, some produced from the photosynthetic reactions, that could harm the cell membrane. One example of how it does this is by reacting with superoxides to form hydrogen peroxide and plastosemiquinone. The reduction (from left to right) of plastoquinone (PQ) to plastosemiquinone (PQH.) to plastoquinol (PQH2). The prefix plasto- means either plastid or chloroplast, alluding to its location within the cell.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Plastoquinone Definition of plastoquinone  Role in photosynthesis  thumb The role that plastoquinone plays in photosynthesis, more specifically in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, is that of a mobile electron carrier through the membrane of the thylakoid. Plastoquinone is reduced when it accepts two electrons from photosystem II and two hydrogen cations (H+) from the stroma of the chloroplast, thereby forming plastoquinol (PQH2). It transfers the electrons further down the electron transport chain to plastocyanin, a mobile, water- soluble electron carrier, through the cytochrome b6f protein complex. The cytochrome b6f protein complex catalyzes the electron transfer between plastoquinone and plastocyanin, but also transports the two protons into the lumen of thylakoid discs. This proton transfer forms an electrochemical gradient, which is used by ATP synthase at the end of the light dependent reactions in order to form ATP from ADP and Pi.  Within photosystem II  Plastoquinone is found within photosystem II in two specific binding sites, known as QA and QB. The plastoquinone at QA, the primary binding site, is very tightly bound, compared to the plastoquinone at QB, the secondary binding site, which is much more easily removed. QA is only transferred a single electron, so it has to transfer an electron to QB twice before QB is able to pick up two protons from the stroma and be replaced by another plastoquinone molecule. The protonated QB then joins a pool of free plastoquinone molecules in the membrane of the thylakoid. The free plastoquinone molecules eventually transfer electrons to the water-soluble plastocyanin so as to continue the light-dependent reactions. There are additional plastoquinone binding sites within photosystem II (QC and possibly QD), but their function and/or existence have not been fully elucidated.  Biosynthesis  The p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is synthesized from tyrosine, while the solanesyl diphosphate is synthesized through the MEP/DOXP pathway. Homogentisate is formed from p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and is then combined with solanesyl diphosphate through a condensation reaction. The resulting intermediate, 2-methyl-6-solanesyl-1,4-benzoquinol is then methylated to form the final product, plastoquinol-9. This pathway is used in most photosynthetic organisms, like algae and plants. However, cyanobacteria appear to not use homogentisate for synthesizing plastoquinol, possibly resulting in a pathway different from the one shown below.center Derivatives Some derivatives that were designed to penetrate mitochondrial cell membranes (SkQ1 (plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium), SkQR1 (the rhodamine-containing analog of SkQ1), SkQ3) have anti-oxidant and protonophore activity. SkQ1 has been proposed as an anti-aging treatment, with the possible reduction of age- related vision issues due to its antioxidant ability.http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v73/pdf/bcm_1329.pdf Mitochondria-Targeted Plastoquinone Derivatives as Tools to Interrupt Execution of the Aging Program. 5. SkQ1 Prolongs Lifespan and Prevents Development of Traits of Senescence. Anisimov etal. 2008 This antioxidant ability results from both its antioxidant ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (derived from the part of the molecule containing plastoquinonol), which are often formed within mitochondria, as well as its ability to increase ion exchange across membranes (derived from the part of the molecule containing cations that can dissolve within membranes). Specifically, like plastoquinol, SkQ1 has been shown to scavenge superoxides both within cells (in vivo) and outiside of cells (in vitro). SkQR1 and SkQ1 have also been proposed as a possible way to treat brain issues like Alzheimer's due to their ability to potentially fix damages caused by amyloid beta. Additionally, SkQR1 has been shown as a way to reduce the issues caused by brain trauma through its antioxidant abilities, which help prevent cell death signals by reducing the amounts of reactive oxygen species coming from mitochondria.

The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  History  Eckerd was founded as Florida Presbyterian College in 1958 as part of national growth in post-secondary education driven by GIs entering college after returning from World War II and later by the baby boom. The United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church worked together to establish the college, receiving a charter from the Florida legislature in 1958 and opening in 1960. The college opened in temporary quarters at Bayboro Harbor with a liberal arts focus and 154 freshmen; it had 310 freshmen and sophomores in January 1962, when it was about to expand with the addition of a junior class, and began the 1966‚Äì1967 academic year with 810 students. In 1971, Jack Eckerd donated $10 million to the college and the following year the institution's name was changed to Eckerd College. A covenant relationship is still maintained with the Presbyterian Church. In the 1980s, college President Peter Armacost decided to spend much of the college's endowment on real estate development ‚Äî specifically, building waterfront homes and a retirement center on college- owned land next to the main campus. In 2000, the Board of Trustees discovered that more than half of Eckerd's endowment had disappeared. Armacost retired, the vice president for finance resigned, and the college eventually lost the partially developed land. In February 2004, the college announced that it had regained solvency. In May 2006, Miles Collier, the chairman of the Board of Trustees, and his wife, Parker Collier, announced a $25 million challenge gift to the college; they subsequently increased this to $40 million. In November 2008, alumnus Grover Wrenn, a member of the founding class in 1960, gave the college a $1 million gift, the largest from an alumnus.

Some 39 majors are offered, including Marine Science, Chemistry, Environmental Studies, International Business, Creative Writing. Students can also design their own majors. Eckerd College originated the 4-1-4 academic calendar, with the \\"1\\" representing the Winter Term during the month of January, in which each student concentrates on a single class. Before graduation, students in nearly all majors are required to either pass a senior-year comprehensive examination or to complete a senior thesis project. All students must complete a senior seminar course in their final year. Among undergraduate research opportunities are available to students is D.A.R.W.I.N., a computer science project (partnered closely with marine science) to automate dolphin dorsal fin recognition. Another is the Eckerd College Dolphin Project, the longest running undergraduate-centered dolphin research program in the world. A United States Geological Survey center in St. Petersburg provides further research opportunities. Wireman Chapel Eckerd students have won more NOAA Hollings Scholarships than students at any other school (66 recipients ). Phi Beta Kappa (Eckerd is one of the youngest colleges in the country to be awarded a chapter) and Sigma Xi are among the nationally recognized academic societies at Eckerd College. Eckerd's Ethics Bowl teams have consistently captured awards in intercollegiate competition, winning the competition for seven straight years (2004-2011). Supporting the academic program is the Peter H. Armacost library, a $15 million facility opened in January 2005. The two-story library is located near the college's student center and dormitories. It houses book and periodical collections and features seating for about 400, including 17 group-study rooms and 58 computer stations. Both high-speed cable and wireless connectivity are available throughout the library. Students can study abroad, including at the Eckerd College Study Centre on London's Gower Street. Foreign students attend Eckerd, which also offers short-term English-immersion courses in a dedicated campus facility. Since 1980, Eckerd College has also been the home of the Leadership Development Institute for managers and executives. Rankings Eckerd College is also one of 40 liberal arts schools profiled in Loren Pope's Colleges That Change Lives, and was ranked tied for 140th of 223 national liberal arts colleges in the United States by U.S. News & World Report for 2020.  Campus  Eckerd College has a suburban campus on Frenchman's Creek and Boca Ciega Bay, about from Gulf of Mexico beaches. The campus is near residential and commercial neighborhoods of St. Petersburg. The college has various sustainability efforts, including bikesharing systems and efforts to reduce plastic waste. The school is ranked on the Princeton Review's list of Green Colleges for its sustainability efforts. Peter H. Armacost Library The college has several architectural styles, but a common feature is the use of glass and external views to emphasize a connection with the environment. Recent campus additions include the Peter H. Armacost Library, Iota residential housing complex, sports facilities, a renovated student center and the renovated Miller Auditorium. Other campus buildings include those designed and used for classrooms, laboratories, offices, conferences, theatrical productions, musical instruction, art exhibits, athletic events, and student services. The James Center For Molecular and Life Sciences, a , US$25 million laboratory facility, opened in February 2013. In Summer 2015, the college was to break ground on a $15 million arts building, bringing together visual and digital arts disciplines currently found across several buildings. The construction of the Sailing Cove is underway on the Western end of the campus beach. Both projects incorporate green initiatives and feature natural landscaping to accent the facilities.  Campus life and activities  Binninger Theatre Eckerd College maintains a regular series of on-campus events for the benefit and enjoyment of campus and community. The music, theatre, and art programs are active in staging concerts, dramatic productions, and artistic shows, respectively, throughout the academic year. On-campus speakers have included the late nobel laureate in economics, Milton Friedman, the late Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, Jimmy Carter, Michael Collins, Anderson Cooper, Jared Diamond, Gerald Ford, Stephen Jay Gould, Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, Stephen King, Henry Kissinger, Richard Leakey, Dennis Lehane, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, William Proxmire, Paul Rusesabagina, Helmut Schmidt, Peter Singer, James Van Allen, Elie Wiesel, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Eckerd's student government, the Eckerd College Organization of Students, gives an annual total of more than $500,000 to more than 100 student-run clubs and organizations, including Eckerd's student newspaper (The Current), a radio station (WECX), a student programming board, Palmetto Productions, sports clubs, cultural clubs, and various academic-related clubs, such as those for anthropology, art, biology, chemistry, philosophy, law, and foreign languages. Among the service clubs are campus chapters of Amnesty International, Circle K, and Habitat for Humanity. Eckerd College also hosts the EC Coalition for Community Justice, a group seeking to raise campus housekeepers' wages. Eckerd's Waterfront Program is a center of watersport activities, such as sailing team, skiing, kayaking, and fishing. An award- winning student group, Eckerd College Search and Rescue (EC-SAR), helps the U.S. Coast Guard in rescue operations throughout the Tampa Bay area. About 80% of Eckerd students live in on-campus residence halls that are either co- educational or all-female; there are no all-male dorms. Eckerd College has 11 residence hall complexes, each with a name from the Greek alphabet. Among these, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Kappa, and Iota complexes offer traditional dorm-style housing. Omega and Nu complexes house upperclassmen, and are organized around suites on each floor. An on-campus hotel was recently converted for student use, and is now called Sigma complex. The newest dorm complex, Iota, opened on September 30, 2006. Since 1973, Eckerd College has set aside pet-friendly housing for students wishing to bring small animals to campus. Every spring, a separate graduation ceremony is held for outgoing pets, complete with \\"diplomas\\" presented by the president. Other special housing includes a \\"Health and Wellness House\\" and \\"Community Service\\" house and an \\"Environmental House\\". The Campus also build a pet park in 2014 for community use.  Environmental sustainability  In 2011, the Eckerd College Sustainability Program was founded. In 2013, Sustainability Fellow (now Director) Evan Bollier started \\"Trash to Treasure,\\" an initiative where volunteer students collect items left after students move out and sell them to students returning the next year. The college has several other initiatives including a bike sharing program, campus recycling and composting. In 2013, the college installed a 50 kilowatt solar powered system, the first on solar initiative on campus. In 2019, president Donald R. Eastman III signed a pledge to prohibit college funds from being used to buy most nonessential single-use plastics.  Athletics  Eckerd College is a member of the Sunshine State Conference (NCAA Division II) fielding 13 athletic teams in coed and women's sailing, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, baseball, volleyball, men's and women's golf, men's and women's tennis, and softball. The Eckerd varsity sailing team competes nationally as a member of the SAISA (the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association) and is a member of the ICSA (Intercollegiate Sailing Association). The college's basketball and volleyball teams play in the McArthur Physical Education Center's gymnasium. A swimming pool, adjacent to the gymnasium, is open to all students. Eckerd's mascot is the Triton, and the school's colors, teal, navy and black were adopted by the athletic programs in 2005; previously the school's colors had been black, red, and white. In 2006, for the first time in the 24-year history of the Eckerd College Women's Volleyball program, the Tritons qualified for the NCAA South Region tournament. In addition to Division II teams, Eckerd students also participate in club sports such as rugby union, lacrosse, and field hockey. The Eckerd College Men's Lacrosse Team finished the 2006 season ranked #3 in the National Collegiate Club Lacrosse Poll, with a 13-1 record. Since its founding in 2003 the team has captured two state championships, a regional championship, and a third-place national finish. In 2000, the Eckerd's Men's club Volleyball Team won the NIRSA Division II Sports Club Volleyball Championships in Reno, Nevada.

Her birth between Cleveland's two terms of office caused a national sensation. Interest in her continued even after her father's second presidential term was over. A sickly child, Ruth Cleveland contracted diphtheria on January 2, 1904. Doctors thought her case was mild, but she died five days after her diagnosis. She is buried in Princeton Cemetery. In popular culture The Curtiss Candy Company asserted that the \\"Baby Ruth\\" candy bar (formerly known as Kandy Kake from 1900‚Äì1920) was named after Ruth Cleveland, a claim that the urban legends website Snopes.com has debunked. The renaming of the candy bar took place in 1921, thirty years after Ruth Cleveland's birth and seventeen years after her death. That same year, legendary baseball player George Herman Ruth, better known by the nickname Babe Ruth, was nearing the top of his popularity, having just broken the single-season home run record. As Richard Sandomir of The New York Times pointed out, \\"For 85 years, Babe Ruth, the slugger, and Baby Ruth, the candy bar, have lived parallel lives in which it has been widely assumed that the latter was named for the former. The confection's creator, the Curtiss Candy Company, never admitted to what looks like an obvious connection ‚Äì especially since Ruth hit 54 home runs the year before the first Baby Ruth was devoured. Had it done so, Curtiss would have had to compensate Ruth. Instead, it eventually insisted the inspiration was \\"Baby Ruth\\" Cleveland, the daughter of President Grover Cleveland.

Although acral lentiginous melanoma is rare in people with lighter skin types, it is the most common subtype in people with darker skins. Acral lentiginous melanoma is observed on the palms, soles, under the nails and in the oral mucosa. It occurs on non-hair-bearing surfaces of the body, which have not necessarily been exposed to sunlight. It is also found on mucous membranes. It is the most common form of melanoma diagnosed amongst Asian and sub-Saharan African ethnic groups. The average age at diagnosis is between sixty and seventy years. Signs and symptoms Typical signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include the following * Longitudinal tan, black, or brown streak on a nail * Pigmentation of proximal nail fold * Areas of dark pigmentation (palms of hands) Warning signs are new areas of pigmentation, or existing pigmentation that shows change. If caught early, acral lentiginous melanoma has a similar cure rate as the other types of superficial spreading melanoma. Causes Acral lentiginous melanoma is a result of malignant melanocytes at the membrane of the skin (outer layers). The pathogenesis of acral lentiginous melanoma remains unknown at this time.  Diagnosis  Although the ideal method of diagnosis of melanoma is complete excisional biopsy, alternatives may be required according to the location of the melanoma. Dermatoscopy of acral pigmented lesions is very difficult but can be accomplished with diligent focus. Initial confirmation of the suspicion can be done with a small wedge biopsy or small punch biopsy. Thin deep wedge biopsies can heal very well on acral skin, and small punch biopsies can give enough clue to the malignant nature of the lesion. Once this confirmatory biopsy is done, a second complete excisional skin biopsy can be performed with a narrow surgical margin (1 mm). This second biopsy will determine the depth and invasiveness of the melanoma, and will help to define what the final treatment will be. If the melanoma involves the nail fold and the nail bed, complete excision of the nail unit might be required. Final treatment might require wider excision (margins of 0.5 cm or more), digital amputation, lymphangiogram with lymph node dissection, or chemotherapy. Histology Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) The main characteristic of acral lentiginous melanoma is continuous proliferation of atypical melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. Other histological signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include dermal invasion and desmoplasia. According to Scolyer et al., ALM \\"is usually characterized in its earliest recognisable form as single atypical melanocytes scattered along the junctional epidermal layer\\". Treatment Therapies for metastatic melanoma include the biologic immunotherapy agents ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab; BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib; and a MEK inhibitor trametinib. Prognosis It has been demonstrated that acral lentiginous melanoma has a poorer prognosis compared to that of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM).

This is often conflated, in laws and in discussion, with criminal exposure to HIV, which does not require the transmission of the virus and often, as in the cases of spitting and biting, does not include a realistic means of transmission. Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the U.S., have enacted laws expressly to criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, charging those accused with criminal transmission of HIV. Other countries, the United Kingdom for example, charge the accused under existing laws with such crimes as murder, fraud (Canada), manslaughter, attempted murder, or assault. Criminal transmission of HIV is now better known as HIV non-disclosure, which is the criminal punishment for not disclosing an HIV positive status. This can be intentionally or unknowingly not disclosing HIV status and then exposing or transmitting HIV to a person. HIV non-disclosure includes intentional transmission, accidental transmission, unknown transmission, and exposure to HIV with no transmission. People have been accused of and charged for HIV non- disclosure even if no harm was intended and if HIV was not actually transmitted. Modes of transmission HIV is spread when one of these bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, breast milk, rectal fluids, or vaginal fluids of an HIV-positive person comes into contact with a mucous membrane or bloodstream of an HIV-negative person. HIV transmission can occur by: * Unprotected sexual intercourse * Sharing needles or other equipment in injection drug use * Giving birth to or breastfeeding a child * Receiving a blood transfusion or organ donation ‚Äì although this is unlikely because blood and organ donations are extensively tested for HIV  Reducing chance of transmission  Having a low viral load decreases the chance of transmitting HIV. A person living with HIV who is taking effective antiretroviral therapy will have a viral load that becomes so low, it is undetectable (less than 50 copies of virus per milliliter). Undetectable viral loads are untransmittable. Proper use of external condoms or internal condoms also greatly reduces any chance of transmission. Legal situation In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In court, prosecutors presented 11,000 text messages and 36 audio clips to support their case against Guerra. Since then, Guerra has been accused of intentionally exposing dozens of other men to HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \\"negligent\\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. From a global perspective, the U.S. and Canada account for the vast majority of reported prosecutions. Australia In Australia the regulations concerned with the transmission of HIV are found in two sources, the Public Healths Acts and in the criminal law. New South Wales The New South Wales (NSW) Public Health Act from 2010 regulates under section 79 that a person with HIV must disclose their status to all sexual partners. Under section 79(3) it is a defence, if the court is satisfied, that the defendant took reasonable precautions to prevent the transmission. In other Australian states, there is no specific legislative requirement to disclose. Interventions may range from counseling through to restrictive orders, with detention as a last resort. If talking about the problems of practising safe sex does not help, the doctor may obtain a Public Health Order to manage the behaviour of the HIV positive person. Only a small number of sex workers and clients have received a Public Health Order or 'management' intervention for potentially breaking the law. Under the criminal law, a person with HIV is criminally liable for prosecution if they have intentionally transmitted the virus to their partner without informing them of their status. In NSW the relevant offences are separated into those done intentionally (s. 33 of the Crimes Act 1900), and those done recklessly (s. 35). The definition of grievous bodily harm (GBH) now explicitly includes (in ss. 4(1)(c)) 'any grievous bodily disease'. This means that the infliction of grievous bodily harm refers to causing a person to contract a grievous bodily disease. Under section 33 a person who intends to inflict grievous bodily harm on another person can be imprisoned for up to 25 years while under section 35 a person who recklessly causes another person grievous bodily harm can be imprisoned for up to 10 years and 14 years if in company. This can include causing someone to be infected with HIV. A person is generally deemed as reckless when they are aware that there is a risk that another person may be caused as a result of their actions, but they proceed to act anyway. Canada Though Canadian federal law does not contain any HIV-specific statutes, HIV transmission and exposure are otherwise prosecuted under general offense laws, such as aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault.  Current law and policy  Commonly referred to as \\"HIV non-disclosure\\", criminal transmission of HIV in Canada is defined as a \\"realistic possibility of transmission\\" of HIV during sexual intercourse. The Supreme Court of Canada defined \\"no realistic possibility of transmission\\" as (1) using a condom and (2) having a low or undetectable viral load. However, the threshold for a low viral load was not defined until 2017 when the Criminal Justice System's Response to Non-Disclosure of HIV made conclusions about the current laws on HIV non-disclosure including that people with low viral loads (under 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood) should not be convicted under the criminal law. In 2019, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights released a report on the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada with four recommendations for the House of Commons and the Canadian Government. The committee recommended that a new law be created specifically for the transmission of HIV, instead of relying on pre-existing laws such as sexual assault. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \\"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual‚Äôs partner is on PrEP or (4) the type of sexual act (such as oral sex) is one where there is a negligible risk of transmission.\\" This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements. HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status.  History  The first notable case of HIV non-disclosure is R. v Cuerrier, where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault and sexual transmission of HIV under section 268 of the Criminal Code. The Supreme Court found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but in May 1999, the British Columbian Attorney-General announced that a new trial would not take place. The Court's ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of R. v Clarence, with L‚ÄôHeureux-Dub√© stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise. R. v Mabior is the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for serostatus nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004‚Äì2006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault. Subsequent legal precedent has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning \\"consensual\\" sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to \\"significant risk of bodily harm\\" remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of Cuerrier. Because Cuerrier did not expressly define \\"significant risk\\", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, Mabior represents a response to Cuerrier and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In Mabior, the Court found that \\"significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused‚Äôs viral load at the time of sexual relations was low or undetectable, and (ii) condom protection was used.\\" On 1 December 2005, Jian Ghomeshi filed a report on this issue for the CBC. He asked whether there is a legal obligation to disclose HIV status. He held up the case of Johnson Aziga, who was diagnosed in 1996 but then allegedly had unprotected sex with at least 13 women. Aziga was charged with two counts of murder and 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault; the prosecution claims that he did not disclose his status. On 4 April 2009, Aziga was found guilty of the two counts of first degree murder as well as the lesser counts. The current precedent in Canada stands as any person who has HIV, fails to disclose the fact to their sexual partner, and does not take some sort of protective measure (such as condom use), is guilty of aggravated sexual assault as per Cuerrier and subsequent cases. Aziga was convicted of first degree murder since under Canadian law; any death as a result of aggravated sexual assault (two of the women died as a result of the HIV infection received from intercourse with Aziga) is automatically first degree murder as per section 231 of the Criminal Code. Several Canadian courts had ruled that people who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex. As a result, the death of Aziga's partners was automatically considered to be murder instead of the lesser charge of manslaughter. However, in Mabior the Supreme Court rejected the view that consent will always be vitiated by non-disclosure of HIV-positive status, substituting the rule that there will be no consent only if in addition to the non-disclosure there was a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV. Finland The first case of criminal HIV infection in Finland was that of Steven Thomas, a US citizen from New York, who was convicted in 1997 in Helsinki for knowingly infecting Finnish women with HIV during 1993‚Äì1996. In January 1997, Finnish police published Thomas' picture in newspapers and stated that Thomas may have infected tens or even hundreds of Finnish women with HIV. Seventeen women said they had been in unprotected sexual contact with Thomas. Thomas was given a 14-year prison sentence at the Helsinki court on 10 July 1997 for 17 counts of attempted manslaughter. Thomas was found to have infected five of the 17 women with HIV, and was ordered to pay damages of $63,000‚Äì$73,000 to each infected victim. The sentence was widely criticised within the legal system, because under Finnish law the maximum sentence for multiple counts of attempted manslaughter is 12 years. Lauri Lehtimaja, the Ombudsman of the Parliament, gave a warning to the court judge about his misuse of the law. The Helsinki Court of Appeal lowered the sentence in December 1997 to be 11 years and 6 months of imprisonment. The documents of the case were classified for 40 years. In 2002 Steven Thomas was quietly released and deported from Finland to an unknown location. A Finnish man convicted of spreading HIV knowingly through unprotected sex with many women was Aki Matti Hakkarainen. He was first convicted in 2005 and sentenced to one year and nine months in prison for attempted aggravated assault. In August 2007, Hakkarainen was arrested by Rovaniemi police after a report from a young woman saying she had contracted HIV from Hakkarainen during unprotected sex. On 5 October 2007, police published the name and photo of Hakkarainen in newspapers in an effort to reach all women who had had sexual intercourse with him. In court, Hakkarainen admitted to having unprotected sex with the women but denied trying to infect them with the virus. On 22 April 2008, Rovaniemi court concluded that Hakkarainen knowingly infected five women with HIV, and in August 2008 he was found guilty of five counts of aggravated assault and 14 counts of attempted aggravated assault. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was also ordered to pay 45,000‚Äì55,000 euros compensation to the five women that contracted the virus. Germany In the Federal Republic of Germany on 16 August 2010, Nadja Benaissa of the German pop music group No Angels admitted to sex with several men while knowing her HIV- positive status, and infecting one of those several, who subsequently brought the case against her. She faced prison, but was instead given probation (2 years) and community service. Women groups were outraged at the possibility of a woman being charged for negligently spreading HIV. She denied any intent to infect, apologising profusely and saying \\"When I was arrested I realised that the way that I had dealt with the illness had been wrong... I made a big mistake... No way did I want my partner to be[come] infected.\\" She stated that she concealed the infection to avoid hurting the success of her band. Benaissa has claimed she had been told by doctors that the risk of passing on the virus was \\"practically zero\\". Libya The HIV trial in Libya, also called 'the Bulgarian nurses affair', concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya. The defendants, arrested in 1999, were one Palestinian medical intern and five Bulgarian nurses (often termed \\"medics\\"). All of the medics were heavily tortured for months to extract confessions. The torture process is described in details in the book Notes from Hell, co- written by Nikolay Yordanov and one of the nurses, Valya Chervianashka. As a result, three of the medics signed confessions. They were first sentenced to death, had their case remanded by Libya's highest court, and were sentenced to death again, which was upheld by Libya's highest court in early July 2007. A Libyan government panel later commuted their sentences to life in prison. The six were released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues. The EU did not condone the guilty verdict in Libya against the six. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and they were freed. Libya has since complained about the releases, and the issue remains ongoing. Furthermore, a controversy has arisen concerning the terms of release, which allegedly include an arms trade as well as a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement signed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in July 2007. New Zealand New Zealand's first case for criminal HIV transmission occurred in 1993, when Peter Mwai, a Kenyan visiting New Zealand on a tourist visa, was sentenced to seven years in prison for infecting at least two women with HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse. Mwai came to New Zealand police attention after a woman reported she had contracted HIV after sleeping with him. Multiple women came forward saying they had unprotected sex with Mwai who had not told them he had HIV. At least two of the women tested positive for HIV. Peter Mwai was charged under existing laws, for causing 'grievous body harm' and 'reckless endangerment'. On 6 October 2005 a New Zealand District Court ruled that HIV-positive people need not tell sexual partners about their status so long as safe sex is practiced. In the case being ruled on, the man had used a condom during intercourse but not during oral sex. His partner had not been infected. The same man was convicted of criminal nuisance earlier for having unprotected sex with another partner without revealing his HIV status. In May 2009, a 40-year- old bisexual man from Auckland was thought to have infected at least five younger gay men between 2008 and 2009. One of the infected men had laid a formal complaint to the New Zealand police, sex venues shut their doors to what was called a 'HIV predator'. and police arrested the 40-year-old man in on 28 May 2009. On 16 June 2009 the court heard that two more people had come forward with complaints bringing the total to six. The eight charges included that he \\"with reckless disregard for the safety of others caused ‚Äì or attempted to cause ‚Äì grievous bodily harm to five males aged 17, 20, 24, 26, and 31, plus a female aged 19.\\" He faced charges of \\"willfully and without justification or excuse causing in a male aged 20 and a female aged 19 a disease, namely HIV.\\" The trial set for 2010 did not proceed as Glenn Mills, accused of knowingly exposing fourteen young people to HIV, was found dead in his Mt Eden remand prison cell on 30 November 2009 after having made two unsuccessful applications to be released on bail in prior weeks. Netherlands Three HIV-positive men, Peter Mulder, Hans Jurgens and Wim Dekker, were jailed in 2008 on charges of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm after drugging and raping 14 men, some of whom they injected with their own HIV-infected blood. Twelve of the victims were HIV-positive or suffering from AIDS at the time of the trial. Poland In Poland under Art. 161 of the Criminal Code, persons who knowingly risk infecting others with HIV are liable to be jailed up to 3 years. Russia Infecting another individual with HIV is a criminal offense unless that individual knew about HIV infection beforehand and consented. United Kingdom Transmission generally may fall under sections 18, 20, 23, 24 or 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (respectively grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent or to resist arrest, GBH generally, poisoning (two sections), and actual bodily harm). As of 19 June 2006, there had been seven convictions for the sexual transmission of HIV in England and Wales under s.20 of the 1861 Act which, inter alia, criminalizes the reckless inflicting of grievous bodily harm. Of these, five were men accused of infecting female partners during sex, one was a man who pleaded guilty to infecting a male partner, and one (in Wales) was a woman. In 2005, the 20-year-old Welsh woman was convicted of infecting her boyfriend with HIV during sex, knowing she had the infection. In 2006, a 43-year-old woman pleaded guilty to recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm on her 31-year-old lover. Only two cases pleaded 'not guilty', and both have gone to appeal. In R. v Dica the Court of Appeal held that a person was reckless if, knowing that they were HIV-positive, they transmitted HIV to a person who had not been told of the infection, and convicted him of a total sentence of 8 years' imprisonment. It was not necessary to prove that the transmission had involved an assault for the \\"inflicting\\" of the disease. They acknowledged that there could be a higher standard of disclosure expected of someone in a relationship, compared with the \\"known risks\\" involved in casual sex. Matthew Weait has critically discussed the case. In R. v Konzani the same court held that a person accused of recklessly transmitting HIV could only raise the defense of consent, in cases where that consent was a \\"willing\\" or \\"conscious\\" consent. In other words, the court distinguished between \\"willingly running the risk of transmission\\" and \\"willingly consenting to the risk of transmission\\". This suggests that consent will only operate as a defense‚Äîin all but the most exceptional of cases‚Äîwhere there has already been prior disclosure of known HIV-positive status. , two women have been convicted for passing on an HIV infection in the UK. The first, from Cardiff, was jailed for 2 years; the second, Sarah Jane Porter, was convicted of grievous bodily harm through the reckless transmission of HIV, and was sentenced to 32 months in prison in June 2006. The National AIDS Trust has published a table of cases of people in England and Wales charged with reckless sexual transmission of HIV.England and Wales, table of cases September 2014, National AIDS Trust, 5 pages In November 2017, a man called Daryll Rowe was convicted of grievous bodily harm after intentionally infecting five men with the virus and attempting to infect five more. The Rowe case has been reported as being the first case in the United Kingdom where the defendant was found guilty for intentionally rather than recklessly transmitting the virus. In 2017, another man, Antonio Reyes-Minana, was convicted of grievous bodily harm after withholding his HIV status from two male partners. An important issue that arises where proof of transmission is required is establishing the source of the complainant's HIV infection. Although it cannot prove the route and timing of transmission, phylogenetic analysis has been used in many trials to demonstrate how closely related HIV strains in samples taken from the defendant and complainant are. The issues and problems surrounding phylogenetic analysis in criminal investigation are discussed in a 2007 report by aidsmap.Edwin J Bernard, Yusef Azad, Anne-Mieke Vandamme, Matthew Weait, Anna Maria Geretti (February 2007). \\"The use of phylogenetic analysis as evidence in criminal investigation of HIV transmission\\" . National AIDS Manual and National AIDS Trust briefing paper. Presentations from the Economic and Social Research Council funded 2011 seminar series \\"HIV/AIDS and Law: Theory, Practice and Policy\\" at Keele University deal with the question of criminalization. Scotland In February 2001 Stephen Kelly, an ex- prisoner and former IV drug user, was convicted of the Scots common law offence of \\"recklessly injuring\\" his former partner by infecting her with HIV. In HMA v Deveraux (2010), the HIV positive defendant pleaded guilty to reckless injury on four counts, one of which led to the victim contracting HIV. United States In July 2010 the White House announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy, a change informed by public health law research carried out by Scott Burris, professor of law at Temple University and the director of its Public Health Law Research program. The Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that \\"the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.\\" In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the 'Positive Justice Project', a campaign to combat HIV-related stigma and discrimination against people with HIV by the U.S. criminal justice system. It released a manual of HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. territories, federal government, and military in 2010. On 23 September 2011, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) introduced H.R. 3053, The Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act or the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act. The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when introduced as H.R. 1843 and referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel. Courts have looked into the statistical probability of HIV transmission to overturn or reduce criminal sentences resulting from prosecutions. For example, on 23 February 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed the aggravated assault conviction of Technical Sergeant David Gutierrez upon determining, that the risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse was not \\"likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm\\" under the applicable statute. As of 2017, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that those who have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood cannot transmit the virus. Criticism of criminal statutes Research has been done on the effects of the criminalization of HIV non- disclosure. It has been demonstrated that these types of laws increase HIV stigma and negatively affect public health. HIV non-disclosure laws and criminalization of HIV transmission may make people less likely to access HIV testing and less likely to disclosure their status or discuss sexual health with a healthcare provider. Although women only make up 10% of Canadian non- disclosure prosecutions, there is an overrepresentation of prosecuted sex workers, Indigenous women, and abuse survivors. There is also a higher proportion of women and indigenous people involved in cases based on low levels of blameworthiness (i.e. difficult life circumstance, spontaneous sexual acts, compliance with authorities, condom use, and evidence that the accused was abused by the complainant). South Africa's openly HIV-positive Supreme Court Justice Edwin Cameron argued against criminalisation at the XVII International AIDS Conference in Mexico City. Additional criticisms of criminalization point to the lack of empirical evidence supporting its ability to stop or slow infections, ongoing reluctance of legal entities to narrowly tailor prosecutions to behaviors that transmit the disease, excessive punishments and disproportionate impact on disenfranchised communities.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1999, and served as a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon. Early life Downey was born in Melita, Manitoba. He served as an Air Cadet, and received an Agriculture Diploma from the University of Manitoba. Before entering political life, he worked as a farmer and auctioneer. Manitoba politics Downey was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, scoring a fairly easy victory in the southwestern rural riding of Arthur (generally regarded as a safe seat for the party). Lyon's Progressive Conservatives defeated the New Democratic Party under Edward Schreyer in this election, and Downey was appointed as Minister of Agriculture on October 24, 1977. He held this position until November 30, 1981, when the NDP returned to power. Downey himself was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, defeating his NDP opponent by over 3500 votes. Despite a credible challenge from the new Confederation of Regions Party, Downey was again re-elected without too much difficulty in the 1986 provincial election. Two years later, he faced a stronger challenge from Liberal Douglas Mosset, but still retained his seat by over 2000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon formed a minority government after this election, and Downey returned to cabinet on May 9, 1988 as Minister of Northern Affairs with responsibility for Native Affairs, the Manitoba Natural Resources Development Act, A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd., the Manitoba Oil and Gas Corporation Act and the Communities Economic Development Fund Act. On April 21, 1989 he was also named minister responsible for Seniors. Downey was again re-elected in the general election of 1990, defeating Liberal Glen McKinnon (later a federal MP) by 2688 votes. He was named Deputy Premier on September 27, 1990, and on February 5, 1991 was named as Minister of Rural Development. After a cabinet shuffle on January 14, 1992, Downey was named Minister of Northern and Native Affairs and Minister of Energy and Mines. He was transferred again on September 10, 1993, this time to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism with responsibility for the Communities Development Corporation Act. Downey was again re-elected without difficulty in the 1995 provincial election, and continued to serve as Deputy Premier and Industry Minister until February 5, 1999. He did not seek re-election later in the year, but instead served as campaign manager for the Progressive Conservatives in their loss to Gary Doer's New Democrats. (He had played the same role for the party in their successful campaign of 1995.) In 2000, Downey endorsed Tom Long's bid to lead the newly formed Canadian Alliance party (National Post, 10 May 2000). In 2004, he endorsed Belinda Stronach for leader of the new Conservative Party of Canada. Downey ran for a directorship on the Canadian Wheat Board in 2002, campaigning against the board's monopoly status. He lost to incumbent Bill Nicholson, who supports the current system.

The process can be \\"cold\\" enfleurage or \\"hot\\" enfleurage.  Process  There are two types of processes: *In cold enfleurage, a large framed plate of glass, called a chassis, is smeared with a layer of animal fat, usually lard or tallow (from pork or beef, respectively), and allowed to set. Botanical matter, usually petals or whole flowers, is then placed on the fat and its scent is allowed to diffuse into the fat over the course of 1‚Äì3 days. The process is then repeated by replacing the spent botanicals with fresh ones until the fat has reached a desired degree of fragrance saturation. This procedure was developed in southern France in the 18th century for the production of high-grade concentrates. *In hot enfleurage, solid fats are heated and botanical matter is stirred into the fat. Spent botanicals are repeatedly strained from the fat and replaced with fresh material until the fat is saturated with fragrance. This method is considered the oldest known procedure for preserving plant fragrance substances. In both instances, once the fat is saturated with fragrance, it is then called the \\"enfleurage pomade\\". The enfleurage pomade was either sold as it was, or it could be further washed or soaked in ethyl alcohol to draw the fragrant molecules into the alcohol. The alcohol was then separated from the fat and allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the absolute of the botanical matter. The spent fat is usually used to make soaps since it is still relatively fragrant.  Other fragrance extraction methods  The enfleurage fragrance extraction method is one of the oldest. It is also highly inefficient and costly but was the sole method of extracting the fragrant compounds in delicate flowers such as jasmine and tuberose, which would be destroyed or denatured by the high temperatures required by methods of fragrance extraction such as steam distillation. The method is now superseded by more efficient techniques such as solvent extraction or supercritical fluid extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) or similar compressed gases.

It was released for the Sega Genesis in Japan in 1993 and Europe and North America in 1995. It is the fourth and final game in the original Phantasy Star series, concluding the story of the Algol Star System. Phantasy Star IV kept many of the gameplay elements of the previous game, including turn-based battles, overhead exploration, and magic spells. It received mixed reviews upon its release, but has been subject to more positive retrospectives. The game was also released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and also for various emulated collections, such as the Phantasy Star Collection, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. Gameplay Phantasy Star IV is an archetypal role-playing video game, featuring the staples of exploration, NPC interaction, and turn-based combat. Like the previous games in the Phantasy Star series, individual characters each have their own statistics and equipment that determine the character's performance in combat, improving their statistics by gaining experience levels (achieved through victory in combat). Additionally, non-android characters have access to \\"Techniques,\\" i.e. magic spells, the use of which draw upon a character's pool of \\"Technique Points\\" (TP), with new techniques being learned as a character gains levels. Phantasy Star IV has a number of features new to the series, including combination techniques, manga-style panel illustrations that accompany the narrative, and an expanded script. The instruction manual for the American version states that there are 15 possible combination attacks. However, only 14 were ever discovered. Occasionally, the \\"secret technique\\" Feeve, a useless technique accessible through hacking, is mistaken for the \\"lost 15th combo.\\" Plot Chaz and Alys explore the town of Piata Phantasy Star IV takes place 1,000 years after the events of Phantasy Star II. After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has been reduced to desert, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the \\"biomonsters,\\" a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia's flora and fauna. Keeping these creatures under control is the job of \\"hunters\\". During an investigation into such an outbreak, Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, learns of the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet's ecological crisis. The planet is in the process of returning to its original desert state as the climate and biosphere-controlling devices installed over a thousand years previous begin to fail. The reasons behind the malfunctions are clarified as the plot unfolds, relating directly to the events of Phantasy Star II. Chaz and his allies connect the world's troubles to a cult leader called Zio, \\"The Black Magician,\\" whose aims appear to be total annihilation, not only of Motavia, but of the whole Algol solar system. The heroes stop Zio in order to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. However, it soon becomes clear that Zio is merely the vanguard to a much larger enemy, long buried in the past. The secrets of the Algol star system are revealed as Chaz and company discover both the nature of the threat to their worlds as well as the safeguards placed in a time long forgotten. Release The game was released in Japan in December 1993, North America in February 1995 and the United Kingdom and Europe in December, 1995. End of the Millennium was the first Phantasy Star title not to be localized to Brazil by Tec Toy. Sega initially stated that they would not publish the game in Europe. In the United States, the game retailed for just under $100. The cover art for the American and European releases was done by Boris Vallejo. Both covers depict Chaz, Rika, and Rune, but the American/European box art deviates from their appearance in-game. In Japan, the game was initially announced as Phantasy Star IV, but by the time of release it had been renamed Phantasy Star: The End of the Millennium. At the time, this renaming was seen by the gaming press as an attempt to make it clear that the game was a followup to Phantasy Star II. The American and European releases took the title Phantasy Star IV, though the title screen of all versions of the game reads Phantasy Star: The End of the Millennium. The titles are combined to Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium in the Sega Genesis Collection compilation. Phantasy Star IV was the last Phantasy Star game until Phantasy Star Online (2000), which has a mainly unrelated story. Ports and remakes The game was ported as part of Phantasy Star Collection for the Sega Saturn, released only in Japan. There was a Windows port released in 2004, as well as its inclusion in the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PSP. It was included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. The game was included on the Sega Genesis Mini. The Sega Ages project planned a remake for the PlayStation 2 console, having revamped the first two games: Phantasy Star Generation 1 and Phantasy Star Generation 2. However, the Sega Ages website confirmed that a port of Phantasy Star Collection for the PlayStation 2 featuring all four of the original games would be released, leaving the previously announced remake in development limbo. Reception Phantasy Star IV: End of the Millennium received generally positive reviews, with critics typically approving of the gameplay elements but disapproving of the story and graphics. GamePro praised the ability to inspect background objects, the convenience of the macros and talk option, and the translation. However, they commented that the inability to purchase multiple items at once is irritating, and were especially critical of the story, describing it as routine, frequently incoherent, and derogatory towards women. Next Generation remarked that Phantasy Star IV, \\"while still a good game, is years behind.\\" They elaborated that while other RPGs were making major innovations to the genre in both graphics and gameplay, Phantasy Star IV still fundamentally looked and played the same as Phantasy Star II from five years before. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are mediocre, the music is irritating, and the story is too slow-paced, but that the magic/technique system, equipment, and general gameplay are all highly involving and enjoyable. Sega Saturn Magazine (previously Sega Magazine) said that the graphics are outdated even compared to other Mega Drive/Genesis games and that the game is incomprehensible to newcomers to the series, but that \\"the game succeeds by creating cinematic moments, introducing new characters and powers, and taking many weird and wonderful plot turns.\\" Mean Machines criticized the graphics, animation, and effects, but praised the playability, story, and lastability, calling it the \\"best pure RPG for the Megadrive.\\" GameFan criticized the translation, but said the \\"graphics are beautiful, the music is powerful, and the non-stop original ideas make this cartridge an absolute must-own for the RPG enthusiast\\". Retrospective reviews have been very positive. In RPGamer, Sepherstein praised the title as one of the greatest RPGs he'd ever played, with \\"magnificent graphics, sensational soundtrack, gripping story and incredible battle system\\". Parn of RPGFan also called it one of \\"the best RPGs ever made\\". Reviews for the Virtual Console release were also very positive. Nintendo Lifes Corbie Dillard said that one couldn't have asked for a better end to the 16-bit series. IGN called it one of the definitive 16-bit role-playing games, stating the \\"storyline and characters are deep and engaging,\\" the \\"attractive anime-style cutscenes steal the show visually,\\" and the gameplay is both \\"classic and unique at the same time.\\" Tor.com described it as \\"an ambitious JRPG that is the perfect end to the series, taking the best elements of each of the previous games and weaving together a 'phantastic' journey.\\" Tor.com Eurogamer stated that it is \\"epic in scope\\" and recommended that \\"anyone with a fondness for JRPGs should investigate this at once.\\" In 2007, IGN ranked Phantasy Star IV as the 61st best game ever made. In 2012, IGN placed Phantasy Star IV at number 59 in their Top 100 RPGs of all time, citing the elegantly simple mechanics and the game's influence on Phantasy Star Online (which they ranked as number 23 on the list). In 2009 Nintendo Power labelled the title, along with Phantasy Star II, as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power February 2009: Issue 2 (in English).

History Lembaga Letrik Pusat (1949-1965) The Lembaga Letrik Pusat (Central Electricity Board, CEB) was established and came into operation on 1 September 1949. The Board was to become heir to three major projects considered by the Electricity Department following its re- establishment in April 1946 which were the Connaught Bridge Power Station, Cameron Highlands Hydroelectric Project & the development of a National Grid. CEB eventually became the owner of 34 power stations with a generation capacity of 39.88 MW, including a steam power station in Bangsar with a capacity of 26.5 MW, a hydroelectric power station at Ulu Langat with a capacity of 2.28 MW, and various diesel powered generators with a total capacity of 11.1 MW. Lembaga Letrik Negara (1965-1990) On 22 June 1965, Central Electricity Board (CEB) of the Federation of Malaya was renamed the Lembaga Letrik Negara (National Electricity Board, NEB) of the States of Malaya. By the 1980s, the Board was supplying the whole peninsula with electricity, replacing the Perak River Hydro Electric Power company (PRHEP) and its subsidiary Kinta Electrical Distribution Co.

He was born in Chincha on November 22, 1933. It had been a long road for Mina. He began life in a rural African- Peruvian community, was a child worker in Chincha, Peru and struggled as a young man in Lima before becoming a professional boxer. As his career and fame progressed, he became the toast of the city, the hope of Peru and a national symbol in a fragmented society. As an amateur he obtained the Latin American championship in the middleweight division on February 1952 in Lima, Peru. He started boxing professionally at the age of 22 defeating Chilean Manuel Vargas in 10 rounds on October 22, 1955. After a few fights in Lima, he had his first loss against Luiz Ignacio, in S√£o Paulo. After the loss to the Brazilian Mina won five straight fights before challenging Uruguayan Dogomar Martinez for the South American Light Heavyweight Title in October 1958. The fight was held in Montevideo, Uruguay and Martinez came out a victorious on a close decision to retain his title. After that fight, Mina would not lose again for the next eight years of his career. In 1960 he was proclaimed South American Light Heavyweight Champion, a title he held until he vacated it in 1966. He was a new talent that arrived on the U.S. boxing scene in the 60s. Mauro Mina had become one of the best light heavyweights in the world by fighting exclusively in South America. Just one more obstacle stood between him and international stardom. He continued boxing and winning during the 60s in fights against Gregorio \\"Goyo\\" Peralta, Freddie Mack, Sugar Boy Nando, Guillermo Dutschmann, Henry Hank, Eddie Cotton all of which he won. He also won a fight against future champion Bob Foster, in 1963. In 1962, after defeating Eddie Cotton by decision in 10 rounds in Lima, he had been ranked the number one contender by the prestigious Ring Magazine. He was ready for a shot at the Light Heavyweight title held by Harold Johnson but the discovery of a retinal injury acquired in one of his previous fights (allegedly against Cuban Lino Rendon) prevented such challenge from ever taking place. After his retirement in 1965, he became a boxing professor in his own gym, and is remembered as a former glory in Peru. He had even a song composed to him by Peruvian singer Chabuca Granda, called \\"Pu√±os de Oro\\". He died in 1993 from a heart attack with a professional record of 58 fights, of which he won 52 (25 by KO), Lost 3, and Drew 3.

United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court holding that the religion clauses of the First Amendment did not prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from revoking the tax exempt status of a religious university whose practices are contrary to a compelling government public policy, such as eradicating racial discrimination.  Background  Because of its interpretation of Biblical principles regarding interracial dating, Bob Jones University completely excluded black applicants until 1971, and from 1971 until 1975, admitted black students only if they were married. After 1975, the University began to admit unmarried black applicants, but continued to deny \\"admission to applicants engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating.\\" The University also imposed a disciplinary rule that prohibited interracial dating. Under pre-1970 IRS regulations, tax exemptions were awarded to private schools regardless of their racial admissions policies, and Bob Jones University was approved for a tax exemption under that policy. Pursuant to a 1970 revision to IRS regulations that limited tax-exempt status to private schools without racially discriminatory admissions policies, the IRS informed the University on November 30, 1970 that the IRS was planning on revoking its tax exempt status as a \\"religious, charitable . . . or educational\\" institution. In response, the University filed suit in 1971 in Bob Jones University v. Schultz. The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina granted a preliminary injunction, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed in 1973, citing the Anti-Injunction Act. The University petitioned for a rehearing in the Appeals Court in Bob Jones University v. Connally. The Appeals Court ruled March 21, 1973, stating that Americans United v. Walters did not conflict with the decision in 1973. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision in Bob Jones University v. Simon (416 US 725). The case was decided May 15, 1974, in an 8-0 decision (Douglas not participating). They stated that there was a lack of proof of \\"irreparable injury.\\" Justice Powell wrote the decision. The IRS again notified the University on April 16, 1975 of the proposed revocation. Officially, the IRS revoked the University's tax exempt status on January 19, 1976. The University paid $21 in unemployment taxes for one employee for tax year 1975 and then filed for a refund in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The Government counterclaimed for unpaid federal unemployment taxes for the taxable years 1971 through 1975, in the amount of $489,675.59, plus interest. The District Court ruled December 26, 1978 that the IRS had violated the University's First Amendment rights, and ordered the IRS to refund the University the $21 of taxes that it had paid. The United States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit ruled that the case be sent back to the District Court.  Supreme Court decision  Bob Jones University v. United States was decided May 24, 1983 in an 8-1 decision with majority opinion written by Warren E. Burger, and joined by William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and Sandra Day O'Connor. The Court, speaking through Burger, read a \\"common law\\" public interest requirement into the statute governing tax-exempt charitable status, and cited Congress' refusal to intervene as proof that they approved of the IRS's construction of the statute. The Court applied a strict scrutiny analysis and found that the \\"Government has a fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education . . . which substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on [the University's] exercise of their religious beliefs.\\" The Court made clear, however, that its holding dealt \\"only with religious schools‚Äînot with churches or other purely religious institutions.\\"However, with this language the Court seemed \\"to apply a least restrictive means free exercise test to a nonprofit private school based on its sincerely held religious beliefs\\" even though BJU was not a church. Martin Wishnatsky, \\"Religious Rights of Non-Church Organizations,\\" Liberty Legal Journal (Spring 2011), 28. Lewis F. Powell wrote a separate concurring opinion, emphasizing the importance of Congressional approval for administrative policy changes. William H. Rehnquist was the sole dissenter, arguing that the literal terms of the governing statute could not be read to exclude Bob Jones from charitable status.  Aftermath  The case has been cited in many decisions that followed as well as by commentators, due to the significance of the precedent established in this case. The ban on interracial dating was lifted in 2000 after Dr. Bob Jones III, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate George W. Bush, announced its nullification on Larry King Live.  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 461 * Coit v.

She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999, and a cabinet minister for most of this period. Among other awards and recognitions, McIntosh has received both the Queen Elizabeth 11 Golden Jubilee Medal and the Queen Eizabeth 11 Diamond Jubilee Medal, for her contributions to Canada.  Early life  The daughter of the late Hugh Laughlin and Gwen Ruth Hopper, McIntosh was born in Montreal, Quebec, the child of a career military officer (RCAF), and was educated in Canada and Europe, attending eleven different schools during the course of her elementary and high school education. In 1960 she graduated from Royal George High School in Greenfield Park and moved to Manitoba (the province in which her parents were raised and to which they eventually retired) and began studies at St. John's College, University of Manitoba. McIntosh graduated with honors from the Manitoba Teachers' College, Tuxedo Campus, in 1963.  Career   Teacher, artist/illustrator, TV Commentator, School Board, Civil Service  McIntosh worked as an elementary school teacher and freelance commercial artist for several years, and was also a political commentator on CBC TV's Friday Night News \\"Week In Review\\" segment in 1985-86. She was the weekly cartoonist/illustrator for local Winnipeg Community Newspapers and the province wide Rupertsland News. She enjoyed a brief stint as an illustrator the Winnipeg Tribune prior to its untimely demise in 1980. McIntosh was elected as a school trustee in the Winnipeg region of St. James-Assiniboia in 1980, and served until 1989, becoming its first female chair in 1984. She was elected to serve as president of the Manitoba Association of School Trustees in the mid-eighties. She married Donald John McIntosh. In June 1988, she was hired as Special Assistant to Progressive Conservative leader Gary Filmon, who had become Manitoba's Premier the previous month.  Legislature  McIntosh was herself elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Ed Mandrake by 1324 votes in the western Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia. On February 5, 1991, she was named Minister of Cooperative, Consumer and Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for the Liquor Control Act. In those roles she had the Residential Tenancy Act re- written and established a Residential Tenancy Court which enabled landlords and tenants with disputes to have their issues resolved quickly and inexpensively without lengthy civil court battles. McIntosh was appointed to the Manitoba Provincial Treasury Board on January 14, 1992 where she served for two years. On September 10, 1993, she was transferred from Consumer and Corporate Affairs to the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Housing. In this portfolio she worked closely with then Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson on a wide variety of inter-provincial issues such as the Shoal Lake Aqueduct agreement and the Municipal/Provincial/Federal Infrastructure Agreements. Her work in the Housing Department earned her public recognition from public housing tenants. McIntosh was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Allen Green by 1130 votes. On May 9, 1995, she was appointed Minister of Education and Training, responsible for K-12 education in public and independent schools and for post secondary education in universities, colleges and apprenticeship programs. As Minister of Education, she was responsible for developing measurable standards for literacy and numeracy at three-year intervals at grades 3, 6, 9, and 12. Mainly diagnostic in nature, these standards tests also counted for a portion of students' final marks at the upper levels of learning. McIntosh felt that her most significant work was the undertaking of a two-year-long Special Needs Study, culminating in recommendations, widely praised, which recommended how to best meet the challenges and opportunities of inclusivism; and how to create the most enabling learning experience for all students, in regular and special needs categories. As the minister responsible for all post-secondary education, she created the Council on Post-Secondary Education to be responsible for co- ordinating efforts amongst Manitoba's Universities and Colleges, to better avoid duplication and overlap, and to ensure seamless movement from one level of learning to another throughout the province. It was under McIntosh's tenure that the Canadian Mennonite University was established, and that a Task Force was established and completed recommendations on what needed to be done to arrange better opportunities for Apprenticeship and Trades training. She increased the student representation on the Universities' Boards of Governors and approved the University of Manitoba's Student Union's Pathways to Excellence brief to the provincial government. Under her Tenure the Red River Community College expanded and was granted new nomenclature, becoming Red River College. She also imposed a number of surcharges for certain university categories in 1995 and 1996, which were regarded by some as particularly severe on foreign students, since foreign students would no longer be given a preferential tuition rate and would have to pay the same fees as Canadian students. McIntosh was no stranger to controversy. Amongst many items which became the topic of public debate during her tenure as Education Minister was the whole question of patriotic exercises in schools and the significance of the monarchy in Canada. In 1998, school principals brought to her attention that the portion of the Manitoba Schools Act concerning patriotic exercises was not being followed in many schools. McIntosh won the support of the Monarchists across the province, and the ire of Canadian republicans, when she sent out a memo to School Divisions reminding them that the Act was to be followed. It became a provincial controversy, with many complaining that semestered school timetables made such exercises difficult to successfully accomplish since not all students would be present for them. In one memorable moment during this controversy, the entire opposition NDP caucus stood and with great gusto sang all the verses of God Save the Queen in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. MLA Doug Martindale (NDP, Burrows) said afterwards that the performance was a \\"serenade\\" for Minister McIntosh. The Lieutenant- Governor of Manitoba, who was present in the House during this escapade, wisely stood silently at attention during the \\"serenade\\" and afterwards made no comment. In the final cabinet shuffle of Filmon's government on February 5, 1999, McIntosh was named Minister of Environment with responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act. McIntosh was very narrowly defeated by New Democrat Jim Rondeau in the 1999 provincial election. McIntosh actually led Rondeau on election night, but fell three votes behind when the institutional and absentee ballots were counted. McIntosh did not seek a return to office in 2003.  Other Career Experience  In 1999 and 2000, McIntosh was Marketing Director for Winnipeg's Portsmouth Retirement Residence during its construction, development and start up, ensuring that accommodation was appropriate for prospective clients' needs. From 2000-2003 McIntosh was president and owner of Roaming Buffalo Communications, a company specializing in speech-writing, brochure design, editing, communications consulting and the production of a magazine, {\\"The Roaming Buffalo Magazine\\"} highlighting Manitoba's people and places. McIntosh was on the local Board of Drectors for the federal Canadian Alliance Party of Canada Canadian Alliance prior to its merger with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. She was a strong supporter of the \\"Unite The Right\\" movement which led to that merger. She subsequently was elected to the local Board of Directors for the new Conservative Party of Canada. During the federal election of 2004 McIntosh campaigned for successful Conservative candidates Steven Fletcher and Joy Smith. McIntosh served as Constituency Assistant for M.P. Steven Fletcher from June 2004 to June 2005.  Author  McIntosh is the author of three biographies of heroic Canadians. Her first book, \\"What Do You Do If You Don't Die?,\\" published by Heartland Associates of Manitoba in 2008, is the story of geological engineer and award winning athlete Steven Fletcher's struggle to return to a full life after becoming paralyzed from the neck down. An inspirational book, it has been praised by advocates for the catastrophically injured, the severely disabled, and those who are struggling to overcome adversity. Linda McIntosh and Steven Fletcher have been friends and confidants since the mid-nineties. McIntosh's second book, \\"Child of Lamposaari\\", published in 2010, is the birth to death biography of Hilkka Nygard, the matriarch of the Nygard Fashion Empire, and a personal friend of McIntosh. The book has been praised by those who are interested in the history of Finland, in which much of the story takes place; and by those who are interested in the many challenges faced by Canadian immigrants. McIntosh has indicated that the book is a tribute, not just to Hilkka Nygard; but to all Canadian immigrant mothers, to the lands they loved and left behind and to the great country to which they came. A third book, Master of My Fate, a continuation of Steven Fletcher's saga, was written in response to a request for \\"more\\" from readers of the first book about Fletcher. This book takes readers through Fletcher's life from 2006 to 2015 and details the many challenges and circumstances he had to overcome during that period. It deals extensively with Steven Fletcher's mission to legalize physician-assisted-death (PAD)in Canada. It includes stories and opinions from advocates and opponents of PAD and the text of the two Bills Fletcher introduced as an MP into the Canadian House of Commons on the topic. At the time of writing the Parliament of Canada had not acted upon the Canadian Supreme Court's order to develop PAD legislation. Hence the book became widely read, discussed and debated. McIntosh is active as a community volunteer in her current locale in northwestern Ontario. She has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Mary Berglund Community Health Centre, serving the township of Ignace and surrounding area including Savant Lake; and to the Board of Directors, Conservative Party of Canada, Kenora, Ontario. McIntosh's nephew Hugh McFadyen was an MLA and the Manitoba PC Party leader from 2006 to 2012. In their time, her grandfather John Bell Laughlin and her great grandfather Andrew Laughlin were also MLAs in south western Manitoba.

Background In 751, Aistulf, king of the Lombards, conquered what remained of the exarchate of Ravenna, the last vestige of the Roman Empire in northern Italy. In 752, Aistulf demanded the submission of Rome and a tribute of one gold solidus per capita. Pope Stephen II and a Roman envoy, the silentiary John, tried through negotiations and bribes to convince Aistulf to back down. When this failed, Stephen led a solemn procession through the streets of Rome and nailed the treaty which Aistulf had violated to a crucifix. He then sent envoys to Pepin the Short, king of the Franks, with a letter requesting his support and the provision of a Frankish escort so that Stephen could go to Pepin to confer. At the time, the Franks were on good terms with the Lombards. In 753, John the Silentiary returned to Rome with an imperial order (iussio) that Pope Stephen accompany him to meet Aistulf in the Lombard capital of Pavia. The pope duly requested and received a letter of transit from the Lombards. With the Frankish envoys who had by then arrived, the pope and the imperial envoy set out for Pavia on 14 October 753. The Roman magnates did not accompany them past the border. At Pavia, Aistulf denied the requests of Stephen and John to return the conquered exarchate to the empire, but he did not prevent Stephen from continuing with the Frankish envoys to the court of Pepin. They left Pavia on 15 November 753. John the Silentiary did not accompany them. This was the first time a pope had crossed the Alps. The decision to act independently of the imperial envoy was of immense moment. It is likely that the pope saw himself as acting on behalf of the Italian province subjugated and threatened by Aistulf. Original promise Pope Stephen met Pepin the Short at the royal estate at Ponthion on 6 January 754. The king led the Pope's horse, while the pope in sackcloth and ashes bowed down and asked Pepin \\"that in accordance with the peace treaties [between Rome and the Lombards] he would support the suit of St Peter and of the republic of the Romans\\". Pepin responded by promising \\"to restore the exarchate of Ravenna and the rights and territories of the republic\\". The exact nature of this commitment cannot be known, but it is unlikely that Pepin had in mind the Roman Empire. It has been suggested that the two parties exchanged oaths on this occasion, but that is unlikely. Over the next two years, Pepin dispatched three embassies to Aistulf demanding that he honour his treaties with the Romans. In April 754, he held a general assembly at Quierzy-sur-Oise. Some noblemen left the proceedings in opposition to the policy, but Pepin restated publicly his promise to the Pope and enumerated the territories that he would restore. Afterwards, this promise was put into writing. On 28 July in the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the Pope anointed Pepin and his sons Charles and Carloman as kings of the Franks and patricians of the Romans . He also pronounced a blessing on Queen Bertrada and the assembled nobility. The pope's right to grant the patrician title is doubtful. Military actions In the spring of 755, Pepin summoned the army to muster at Braisne-sur-Vesle. He sent envoys ahead to offer Aistulf an indemnity if he restored the Roman territories he had taken in violation of his treaties. The Frankish army crossed the Mont C√©nis and defeated the Lombard army near Susa. Defeated, Aistulf submitted to some form of Frankish overlordship and promised under oath to return Ravenna and the other cities he had occupied to the Pope. The peace treaty was signed by the \\"Romans, Franks and Lombards\\" without direct reference to the Empire. As soon as the Frankish army left Italy, Aistul disregarded the treaty. On 1 January 756, he put Rome under siege. The Pope appealed to the Franks. After three months, Aistulf abandoned the siege. In April, a Frankish army once again invaded Italy and defeated the Lombards. Aistulf was forced to give hostages and pay annual tribute to the Franks. He also had to promise in writing to return the occupied territories to the Pope. Final agreement The treaty officially conferred upon the pope the territories belonging to Ravenna, even cities such as Forl√¨ with their hinterlands, the Lombard conquests in the Romagna and in the Duchy of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis (the \\"five cities\\" of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia and Ancona). Narni and Ceccano were former papal territories. The territories specified in the treaty of 756 had belonged to the Roman Empire. Envoys of the Empire met Pepin in Pavia and offered him a large sum of money to restore the lands to the Empire, but he refused, saying that they belonged to St Peter and the Roman church. The exact boundaries of the grant to the Pope can only be approximated, since the text of the treaty does not survive. It is possible that the boundaries were the same as those in a previous Imperial‚ÄìLombard treaty. Abbot Fulrad was charged with collecting the keys of the cities t be handed over and depositing them along with the written agreement on the tomb of St Peter. The Donations made the Pope a temporal ruler for the first time. This strip of territory extended diagonally across Italy from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic. Over these extensive and mountainous territories the medieval Popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty, given the pressures of the times. Charlemagne In 774 Pepin's son Charlemagne visited Rome and again confirmed and reasserted the Donation. Some later chronicles falsely claimed that he also expanded them, granting Tuscany, Emilia, Venice and Corsica.

The blade's punched decoration suggests German make. This is an example of a battle axe that was tailored for the use of a mounted knight. The wooden haft is modern. A battle axe (also battle-axe, battle ax, or battle-ax) is an axe specifically designed for combat. Battle axes were specialized versions of utility axes. Many were suitable for use in one hand, while others were larger and were deployed two-handed. Axes designed for warfare ranged in weight from just over , and in length from just over to upwards of , as in the case of the Danish axe or the sparth axe. Cleaving weapons longer than 150 cm would arguably fall into the category of polearms. Overview Through the course of human history, commonplace objects have been pressed into service as weapons. Axes, by virtue of their ubiquity, are no exception. Besides axes designed for combat, there were many battle axes that doubled as tools. Axes could be modified into deadly projectiles as well (see the francisca for an example). Axes were often cheaper than swords and considerably more available. Battle axes generally weigh far less than modern splitting axes, especially mauls, because they were designed to cut legs and arms rather than wood; consequently, slightly narrow slicing blades are the norm. This facilitates deep, devastating wounds. Moreover, a lighter weapon is much quicker to bring to bear in combat and manipulate for repeated strikes against an adversary. The crescent-shaped heads of European battle axes of the Roman and post-Roman periods were usually made of wrought iron with a carbon steel edge or, as time elapsed across the many centuries of the medieval era, steel. The hardwood handles of military axes came to be reinforced with metal bands called langets, so that an enemy warrior could not cut the shaft. Some later specimens had all-metal handles. Battle axes are particularly associated in Western popular imagination with the Vikings. Certainly, Scandinavian foot soldiers and maritime marauders employed them as a stock weapon during their heyday, which extended from the beginning of the 8th century to the end of the 11th century. They produced several varieties, including specialized throwing axes (see francisca) and \\"bearded\\" axes or \\"skeggox\\" (so named for their trailing lower blade edge which increased cleaving power and could be used to catch the edge of an opponent's shield and pull it down, leaving the shield- bearer vulnerable to a follow-up blow). Viking axes were wielded with one hand or two, depending on the length of the plain wooden haft. (See entry for Viking Age arms and armor.)  History  Europe Prehistory and the ancient Mediterranean Stone axe heads in polished greenstone from the collections of the H√¥tel-Dieu in Tournus (Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, France). Found in Sa√¥ne River Stone hand axes were in use in the Paleolithic period for hundreds of thousands of years. The first hafted stone axes appear to have been produced about 6000 BCE during the Mesolithic period. Technological development continued in the Neolithic period with the much wider usage of hard stones in addition to flint and chert and the widespread use of polishing to improve axe properties. The axes proved critical in wood working and became cult objects (see, for example, the entry for the Battle-axe people of Scandinavia, who treated their axes as high-status cultural objects). Such stone axes were made from a wide variety of tough rocks such as picrite and other igneous or metamorphic rocks, and were widespread in the Neolithic period. Many axe heads found were probably used primarily as mauls to split wood beams, and as sledgehammers for construction purposes (such hammering stakes into the ground, for example). Narrow axe heads made of cast metals were subsequently manufactured by artisans in the Middle East and then Europe during the Copper Age and the Bronze Age. The earliest specimens were socket- less. More specifically, bronze battle-axe heads are attested in the archaeological record from ancient China and the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt. Some of them were suited for practical use as infantry weapons while others were clearly intended to be brandished as symbols of status and authority, judging by the quality of their decoration. The epsilon axe was widely used during the Bronze Age by irregular infantry unable to afford better weapons. Its use was limited to Europe and the Middle East. In the eastern Mediterranean Basin during the Iron Age, the double-bladed labrys axe was prevalent, and a hafted, single-bitted axe made of bronze or later iron was sometimes used as a weapon of war by the heavy infantry of ancient Greece, especially when confronted with thickly-armored opponents. The sagaris‚Äîdescribed as either single bitted or double bitted‚Äîbecame associated by the Greeks with the mythological Amazons, though these were generally ceremonial axes rather than practical implements. The Barbarian tribes that the Romans encountered north of the Alps did include iron war axes in their armories, alongside swords and spears. The Cantabri from the Iberian peninsula also used battle axes. The Middle Ages An ornamented, 7th-century Merovingian battle axe head on display in the British Museum.Iron Axe Head Inlaid With Silver, British Museum, retrieved 5th June 2010. Battle axes were very common in Europe in the Migration Period and the subsequent Viking Age, and they famously figure on the 11th-century Bayeaux Tapestry, which depicts Norman mounted knights pitted against Anglo-Saxon infantrymen. They continued to be employed throughout the rest of the Middle Ages, with significant combatants being noted axe wielders in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. King Stephen of England famously used a Danish axe at the Battle of Lincoln 1141. One account says that he used it after his sword broke. Another says he used his sword only after his axe broke. Richard the Lionheart was often recorded in Victorian times wielding a large war axe, though references are sometimes wildly exaggerated as befitted a national hero: \\"Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, his terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English steel in its mighty head...\\" ‚Äì A Child's History of England by Charles Dickens.Dickens is referencing Chaucer here, from the Tournament of Theseus of Athens in the Knights Tale, where a combatant \\"hath a sparth of twenty pound of weight\\" Richard is, however, recorded as using a Danish Axe at the relief of Jaffa.Old French Continuation of William of Tyre, in The Conquest of Jerusalem and the Third Crusade: Sources in Translation, ed. Peter W. Edbury, p. 117. Geoffrey de Lusignan is another famous crusader associated with the axe. Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, used an axe to defeat Henry de Bohun in single combat at the start of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Given that Bruce was wielding the axe on horseback, it is likely that it was a one handed horseman's axe. They enjoyed a sustained revival among heavily armored equestrian combatants in the 15th century. In the 14th century, the use of axes is increasingly noted by Froissart in his Chronicle, which records the engagements between the kingdoms of France and England and the rise of professional (and mercenary) armies in the 14th century. King John II is recorded as using one at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and Sir James Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388. Bretons were apparently noted axe users, with noted mercenaries Bertrand du Guesclin and Olivier de Clisson both wielding axes in battle. In these instances the type of battle axe - whether a Danish axe, or the proto-pollaxe - is not recorded. Most medieval European battle axes had a socketed head (meaning that the thicker, butt-end of the blade contained an opening into which a wooden haft was inserted), and some included langets‚Äîlong strips of metal affixed to the faces of the haft to prevent it from being damaged during combat. Occasionally the cheeks of the axehead bore engraved, etched, punched or inlaid decorative patterns. Late- period battle axes tended to be of all-metal construction. Such medieval polearms as the halberd and the pollaxe were variants of the basic battle-axe form. Steel plate-armor covering almost all of a knight's body, and incorporating features specifically designed to defeat axe and sword blades, become more common in the late 14th and early 15th century. Its development led to a generation of hafted weapons with points that concentrated impact, either to penetrate steel plate or to damage the joints of articulated plate. Increasingly daggers called misericords were carried which enabled a sharp point to be thrust though gaps in armour if an opponent was disabled or being grappled with. Swords styles became more diverse ‚Äì from the two-handed zweih√§nders to more narrow thrusting instruments with sharply pointed tips, capable of penetrating any \\"chinks in the armour\\" of a fully encased opponent: for example, the estoc. The newly invented flanged mace, for example, was no crude bludgeon like its predecessors. The vertical flanges projecting at regular intervals from its head could fracture plate armor and smash into underlying body tissue‚Äîyet it was a much cheaper weapon to make than a sword, whose blade was inclined in any case to glance harmlessly off the smooth, curved plates of a well-designed suit of armor if used in a chopping manner. A sharp, sometimes curved pick was often fitted to the rear of the battle axe's blade to provide the user with a secondary weapon of penetration. A stabbing spike could be added, too, as a finial. Similarly, the war hammer evolved in late-medieval times with fluted or spiked heads, which would help a strike to \\"bite\\" into the armour and deliver its energy through to the wearer, rather than glance off the armor's surface. Strikes from these armour penetrating picks were not always fatal. There are many accounts of plate armored knights being struck with said weapons and while the armour was damaged, the individual underneath survived and in some cases completely unharmed.Sydney Anglo (2000), The Martial Art of Renaissance Europe. New Haven and London. Yale University Press. P.150 It eventually became common for these various kinds of impact weapons to be made entirely from metal, thus doing away with reinforced wooden shafts. A useful visual guide to high-medieval battle axes, contemporary with their employment, are the scenes of warfare depicted in the Maciejowski Bible (Morgan Bible) of circa 1250.The Morgan Picture Bible Battle axes also came to figure as heraldic devices on the coats of arms of several English and mainland European families. Post-medieval axes Battle axes were eventually phased out at the end of the 16th century as military tactics began to revolve increasingly around the use of gunpowder. However, as late as the 1640s, Prince Rupert‚Äîa Royalist general and cavalry commander during the English Civil War‚Äîis pictured carrying a battle axe, and this was not merely a decorative symbol of authority: the \\"short pole-axe\\" was adopted by Royalist cavalry officers to penetrate Roundhead troopers' helmets and cuirasses in close-quarters fighting,Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England (Oxford 1807), vol 2, pt. 1, p. 59 and it was also used by their opponents: Sir Bevil Grenville was slain by a Parliamentarian pole-axe at the Battle of Lansdowne,Clarendon, History of the Rebellion, ii. pt. 1, p. 425 and Sir Richard Bulstrode was wounded by one at the Battle of Edgehill. In Scandinavia, however, the battle axe continued in use alongside the halberd, crossbow and pole-axe until the start of the 18th century. The nature of Norwegian terrain in particular made pike and shot tactics impracticable in many cases. A law instituted in 1604 required all farmers to own weaponry to serve in the militia. The Norwegian peasant militia battle axe, much more wieldy than the pike or halberd and yet effective against mounted enemies, was a popular choice. Many such weapons were ornately decorated, and yet their functionality shows in the way that the axe head was mounted tilting upwards slightly, with a significant forward curve in the shaft, with the intent of making them more effective against armoured opponents by concentrating force onto a narrower spot.Norwegian military small-arms & blades ¬ª The Norwegian Battle axe During Napoleonic times, and later on in the 19th century, farriers in army service carried long and heavy axes as part of their kit. Although these could be used in an emergency for fighting, their primary use was logistical: the branded hooves of deceased military horses needed to be removed in order to prove that they had indeed died (and had not been stolen). Napoleon's Pioneer Corps also carried axes that were used for clearing vegetation‚Äîa practice employed by similar units in other armies. Middle East The tabarzin (, lit. \\"saddle axe\\" or \\"saddle hatchet\\")Crusader Warfare: Muslims, Mongols and the struggle against the Crusades by David Nicolle is the traditional battle axe of Persia. It bears one or two crescent-shaped blades. The long form of the tabar was about seven feet long, while a shorter version was about three feet long. What made the Persian axe unique is the very thin handle, which is very light and always metallic.Complete Persian culture (Dary dialect) by Gholam-reza Ensaf-pur The tabar became one of the main weapons throughout the Middle East, and was always carried at a soldier's waist not only in Persia but Egypt, and the Arab world from the time of the Crusades. Mamluk bodyguards were known as tabardiyya after the weapon. The tabarzin is sometimes carried as a symbolic weapon by wandering dervishes (Muslim ascetic worshippers). File:Darvish bazaar.jpg|A Qajar-era Persian dervish, with Tabarzin (axe) Tehran's Grand Bazaar. File:Preziosi - Dervi≈ü cer≈üetor.jpg|A dervish with Tabar (axe) Asia China Different types of battleaxes may be found in ancient China. In Chinese mythology, Xingtian (), a deity, uses a battle axe against other gods. The qi () and yue () are heavy axes. They were common in Zhou dynasty but fell out of favor with users due to the lack of mobility. The eventually became used only for ceremonial purposes and such battleaxes made of bronze and jade have been found. The dagger axe (ge) is another form used in ancient times.A Shang dynasty ceremonial Yue A Japanese rendition of the axe-wielding outlaw, Li Kui Chinese battleaxes can be divided in three subgroups: Fu (), Yue () and Ge (). The distinction between a Yue and a Fu is that a Yue is, as a general rule, broader than a Fu. In the Shang dynasty the Yue was also a symbol of power, the bigger the Yue, the greater the power. There are a few rare examples of Yue with a round blade and a hole in the middle. A dagger-axe The Chinese Fu appeared in the stone age as a tool. In the Shang dynasty (‚Äì) the Fu began to be made from bronze, and began to be used as a weapon. However, the prominence of the Fu waned on the battlefield as the Zhou dynasty came to power. In the Warring States era iron axes started to appear. Up until the Han and Jin dynasty, after having lost its importance on the battle-field, the Fu once again appeared as the cavalry was used more often. In the Sui and Tang dynasties there is evidence of the subdivision of the Fu. During the Song dynasty axes were popularized and many types of axes began to exist. The types include Phoenix Head Axes ( ), Invincible Axe ( ), Opening Mountain Axe ( ), Emei Axe ( ) and Chisel Head Axes ( ). A well known novel from the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) knows as the Outlaws of the Marsh (or the Water Margin - Shui Hu Zhuan ) features a character known as Li Kui, the Black Whirlwind who wields two axes and fights naked. In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, axes retained their use in the army. In the Qing dynasty new types of axes emerge among the Eight Banners Army with straight edges. The Green Standard Army among the Eight Banners used double axes weighing each, with a length of . In modern Chinese wushu and Chinese opera there are many depictions of the axe. Many of these axes look thick and heavy, however, the axe heads are hollow. Indian Subcontinent The battle axe of ancient India was known as a parashu (or farasa in some dialects). Made from iron, bamboo, wood, or wootz steel, it usually measures though some are as long as . A typical parashu could have a single edge or double edge, with a hole for fixing a shaft. The haft is often tied with a leather sheet to provide a good grip. The cutting edge is invariably broad and the length of the haft could be about three to four feet. The parashu is often depicted in religious art as one of the weapons of Hindu deities such as Shiva and Durga. The sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu, Parashurama, is named after the weapon. Parashu are still used as domestic tools in Indian households, particularly in the villages, as well as being carried by certain sects of eremitic sadhu.

Philippines Panabas The panabas is the 19th-century battle axe as well as the chopping tool favored by the Moro tribes of Mindanao. It ranges in size from and usually long and can be held with one or two hands. Hilts were often wrapped in rattan bindings or had metal collars. Due to its clean cutting capabilities it was also sometimes used as an execution weapon. It is said that the Moro warriors wielding panabas would follow the main group of warriors up front and would immediately charge in on any American survivors of the first wave of attack during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Sri Lanka The keteriya was a type of battle axe that was used in ancient Sri Lanka. A keteriya consisted of a single edge and a short handle made of wood. This would allow the user to wield it with a single hand.

Background  Semple was born on 26 February 1777 in Boston, Mass. He was the son of Robert Semple, a prominent London merchant and Anne Greenlaw. Semple‚Äôs parents were loyalists, and sometime during or after the American revolution, the family returned to England. Because he was not a British citizen, but an American, Semple was able to travel to many countries that the English were banned from. During his travels he wrote travel books including Walks and sketches at the Cape of Good Hope; to which is subjoined a journey from Cape Town to Blettenberg‚Äôs Bay (London, 1803); Observations on a journey through Spain and Italy to Naples; and thence to Smyrna and Constantinople: comprising a description of the principal places in that route, and remarks on the present natural and political state of those countries (2v., London, 1807); A second journey in Spain, in the spring of 1809; from Lisbon, through the western skirts of the Sierra Morena, to Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada, Malaga, and Gibraltar; and thence to Tetuan and Tangiers (London, 1809); Sketch of the present state of Caracas; including a journey from Caracas through La Victoria and Valencia to Puerto Cabello (London, 1812); and Observations made on a tour from Hamburg, through Berlin, Gorlitz, and Breslau, to Silberberg; and thence to Gottenburg (London, 1814). It is possible that it was while he was traveling that he met Thomas Douglas, the 5th Lord of Selkirk who appointed him as Governor of Assiniboia and Governor in chief of Rupert's Land. Semple began his position 12 April 1815 and was paid 1,500 pounds annually for his work. He then left for the Red River Settlement. It is not clear why Semple was given the position of governor.  Red River Settlement  Selkirk's settlers first arrived at the Red River settlement in August 1812. The governor at this time was Miles Macdonell. Under the rule of Macdonell, the settlement had been attacked and destroyed by North West Company members. Due to this failure, Macdonell lost support. Red River Settlers were anxious for the arrival of Semple, who was expected to be much more popular than Macdonell. At the age of 49, Semple landed at York Factory in August 1815 with other settlers. They had to journey from York to the Red River Settlement, which they arrived at on 3 November. Lord Selkirk appointed Semple to be the governor of the territories owned by the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company. He controlled the land known as the Forks which consisted of Fort Douglas, Fort Gibraltar, and Seven Oaks. The committee meeting held, resolved to appoint Semple. However, there was no information provided in the minutes from the meeting as to why Semple was chosen for the position. He was not proven to be qualified for the position of governor.  Colin Robertson  Colin Robertson, was a member of the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company who helped rebuild the Red River Settlement prior to Semple‚Äôs arrival. The two men had a complicated relationship. as Semple wanted to prove himself as master through his powerful decisions. Meanwhile, Robertson did not approve of many of the decisions that Semple was making. His disapproval lead Robertson to leave the Settlement on 11 June 1816 and he intended to return to England. After Semple began achieving success and support, Robertson asked to return to the settlement, which Semple rejected.  Semple as Governor  Semple did many things in the first few years of being governor. During his first December at the settlement, he went to Fort Daer (Pembina, N.Dak) and visited settlers who had moved there for the winter due to a shortage of food. He then continued and visited all of the different posts on the upper Assiniboine and Qu‚ÄôAppelle rivers that belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company. When he returned, Semple began to attack his neighbours, the North West Company and the Metis. Semple encouraged his colonists to settle on farms two miles down the river from Red River and he blocked the rivers at The Forks. Controversy arose at the Red River settlement when on the tenth of June, 1816 Semple decided to attack and dismantle Fort Gibraltar, the Fort owned by the North West Company. After seizing the fort, Semple took all of the usable belongings and shipped them to Fort Douglas. Everything that was left he burned so that it could not be rebuilt by the North West Company. Colin Robertson disagreed with what Semple was doing and his means to prove a point. This was when Robertson decided that he would no longer support Semple as the governor and left the settlement. Semple‚Äôs actions played a large role in the feud between the two men. The Metis also view the destruction of the fort with disgust, they saw the burning and dismantling of the Fort as an act of war. Due to Semple drastic measures, he essentially ensured no way for a peaceful settlement to occur between the Hudson's Bay Company, the North West Company, and the Metis. After destroying Fort Gibraltar, Semple then took over the North West Company‚Äôs post at Pembina on 23 March 1816. After another attack by the Hudson's Bay Company, the North West Company and the Metis who were all living in close proximity to Semples land, began to prepare for war. Cuthbert Grant, the leader of the Metis, wanted to take back Qu‚Äôappelle. They fought and took back the Brandon house from the Hudson's Bay Company on 1 June 1816.  Seven Oaks  Seven Oaks was a clash between the Metis, North West Company members, and Selkirk settlers. The skirmish began when a man by the name of Moustouche Boutino let Semple know that Cuthbert Grant and his men had prepared for war, and wanted to take Semple as a prisoner. When Semple heard a few days later that a watchman at Fort Douglas had seen the Metis half a mile down, Semple asked 20 men to follow him to meet them. The men at Red River liked Semple, and were loyal to him. All of the men wanted to follow him, however they obeyed and limited their numbers to 20. Semple said he was not going to fight, and that he only wanted to ask them what the Metis wanted; meanwhile, his men that came were all given muskets, bayonets, as well as ball and powder. \\"In this discrepancy in Semple‚Äôs actions lay the cause of the events of 19 July. He had no desire for a conflict, and much reason to avoid one, but his actions and his position made one most likely.\\" While Semple and his men were preparing to meet them, the Metis started to move away from Fort Douglas. However, instead of letting them pass, Semple insisted on meeting them. The two groups met at close range, the Metis forming a semicircle, and the Selkirk settlers forming a line so that the Metis could not pass. At first, the Metis had 15 men whereas Semple had 24. However, other Metis and North West Company men were quick to arrive, and Semple was now outnumbered. Fran√ßois-Firmin Boucher, a Canadian member of the North West Company, moved forward to speak with Semple. There are a few different versions of how the next events took place. John Pritchard, an eyewitness, stated that when the two men met, they both asked the other what they wanted. Boucher finally told Semple, \\"We want our fort back\\". Semple fueled the Canadian's anger by telling him, \\"Then go get your fort\\" and reached to grab Boucher's gun. Michael Heyden states that Boucher asked the governor, \\"Why did you destroy our fort, you damned rascal\\". Semple then went to grab Boucher‚Äôs horse‚Äôs reins and told his men to take Boucher as a prisoner. It is not clear whether Semple was reaching for Boucher‚Äôs gun, or his horse's bridle. But, while Semple was reaching for him, Boucher dismounted his horse and began running back to his side. Boucher's account differs slightly, in that Semple and his men disarmed him, and that his horse took flight and that he was fired upon while riding the frightened animal away. One of Semple's men fired his gun, which triggered the fighting. Within 15 minutes nearly everyone from Semple's group was either injured or dead. Semple was still alive when the fighting ended, but had a non-fatal injury. Semple asked Grant to allow him to go back to the fort so he would live and Grant agreed. However, before he could leave an Indian rode past and shot him in the chest, killing him. In total, 22 men died in the battle, 21 were from Semple's side, including himself. On the other hand, only one man died from the Metis group. Nearly all of Semple's men died, but John Pritchard, one of the few to survive, wrote on what happened at the battle. The recount that he left remains one of the best and most reliable English accounts on the Seven Oaks massacre. Miles Macdonell was the first from the Hudson's Bay Company to hear about the massacre, and told Lord Selkirk on 24 July what had happened at the Red River Settlement. Selkirk, infuriated, went to the North West Company headquarters to confront them on what their men and the Metis had done. In total, 17 men, including Cuthbert Grant, were charged with the murder of Robert Semple. Due to his actions and the outcome at Seven Oaks, Cuthbert Grant became one of the most hated men to the Red River settlers.  Controversy of Seven Oaks as a Massacre  The battle that happened at Seven Oaks has traditionally been viewed by historians as a massacre. It is now being argued by Dick Lyle, that it was not a massacre, but that the incident at Seven Oaks was a tool used by white-Anglo Canadians to portray the metis as violent and as a result, justify taking their homes on First Nations lands. The history has been written to show Europeans as civilized and superior to people of indigenous backgrounds. Historians that wrote on this event used sources that promoted Anglo-Canadian ideology and thus, did not properly account what happened at the battle.  Coltman's Report  One of the first accounts of what happened at Seven Oaks is known as Coltmans report. Today, Coltman is praised for providing one of the best sources on the incident. Unfortunately, this source was largely ignored by many historians until 1910. Coltman gathered information from an equal number of people, from both sides of the battle, and analysed their credibility. Coltman also did not let his personal beliefs cloud his report. Overall, the information that he gathered was mostly unbiased and very extensive. The conclusions that Coltman made in his report did not support the ideals that many of the white-Anglo historians wanted to convey. This source was intentionally ignored as historians would choose sources that agreed with their opinions rather than those that told the truth. Coltman‚Äôs report determined that the Selkirk men fired the first shot and began the battle. He argued that the battle should not be called a massacre because Semple had begun the battle. The fight was lost due to the Selkirk men being unaccustomed to the way the Metis fought. The Metis were skilled at close combat, allowing them to win the battle with such a high rate of success. Coltman examined the rumours of the Metis \\"finishing off the enemy\\", meaning killing men that would have otherwise lived. He determined that this practice did happen but it was not an act of extreme violence. Rather, they did this because the Metis did not take prisoners. Other rumours such as the Metis did not bury the bodies and left them to be eaten by animals were found to be true. Coltman argued that some Metis did behave cruelly, but it could not be applied to the whole group.  Chanson de la Grenoillirere  Pierre Falcon a M√©tis, wrote the \\"Chanson de la Grenoillirere\\" a song about what happened at the battle of Seven Oaks. This song was not ever looked at by historians for the same reasons that Coltmas report was not utilised; because it did not support the ideals of the white-Anglo historian.  Alexander Ross  Alexander Ross wrote a book on the battle in 1856. Modern historians explain that \\"Ross‚Äôs interpretive framework is uncomplicated: it is a straightforward expression of the theme of \\"civilization versus savagery\\". The civilized white man versus the savage Indian that Ross portrayed became a theme that repeated in the majority of history books afterwards. The Metis were labeled as the ones who fired the first shot and killed Semple and his men. The writing of the book was an \\"effort by Ross to privilege his own European ethnicity in opposition to the poisted savagery of all Native people within the Red River Settlement, including persons of mixed race\\". Ross's book had success and was widely accepted by historians despite much of the account being false and lacking in proper evidence. It was this book that began the false telling of what happened at the Red River Settlement between Semple and Grant. The stereotypes he created would then be repeated throughout history. The history that Ross wrote is said to have been the tool used by white Anglos to justify having settled on native land without reasonable grounds.  George Bryce  Similar to Ross, George Bryce was asked to write Manitoba's history from his white, European, and upper class perspective. The history that he wrote was one sided and promoted Selkirks actions. Bryce describes \\"Selkirk and his party [as] the unproblematic heros, and the NWC and the Metis the villains, underscored by their putative role at Seven Oaks\\". There were many problems with the credibility of Bryce's research. \\"In researching 7 oaks, [Bryce] simply looked for testimony from the Selkirk side alleging Metis savagery, quoted it at length and ignored contrary evidence\\". Thus, the same problems and stereotypes that were present in Ross‚Äôs history were then repeated and set further precedent for other historians poorly representing the incident at Seven Oaks. Bryce, like Ross understood that \\"representing 7 oaks as a \\"massacre: was therefore integral the construction of a new master narrative of progress in the West\\".  French Canadian Writings  Writings on the Seven Oaks incident by French Canadians were kinder to the Metis, but still stated that the Metis were responsible for the battle and coined the event as a massacre.  W. L. Morton  W. L. Morton‚Äôs history further discredited the Metis. He states in his history that either Deschamps or Machicabou (an Indian) killed Semple and repeatedly represents the Metis as savages who terrorised Semple's group. Like the other white-Anglo historians before him, Morton wrote a biased history that promoted his ethnic group and class. His history was also used to discredit the Riel resistance. In his writings, Morton was harsher on the description of the Metis. Whereas older historians had presented the Metis as wild but noble (a mix of positive and negative characteristics) Morton describes the Metis as completely negative.  Legacy  To justify white-Anglo actions, the Metis needed to be shown as violent and lacking judgement and a prime example of this was done through the histories written on the battle at Seven Oaks. \\"Seven oaks provided a convenient vehicle for the presentation of an alleged metis weakness of character, implicitly justifying the disposition of their lands\\". Today, the myths of what happened at Seven Oaks have become nearly \\"resistant to revision\\" due to the original histories on the topic.

According to this theory, an individual weighs every new idea, comparing it with the individual's present point of view to determine where it should be placed on the attitude scale in an individual's mind. SJT is the subconscious sorting out of ideas that occurs at the instant of perception. Overview Social judgment theory is a framework that studies human judgment. It is a meta-theory that directs research on cognitive perspective, which is how you perceive the situations. The psychophysical principle involved for example, is when a stimulus is farther away from one's judgmental anchor, a contrast effect is highly possible; when the stimulus is close to the anchor, an assimilation effect can happen. Social judgment theory represents an attempt to generalize psychophysical judgmental principles and the findings to the social judgment. With the person's preferred position serving as the judgmental anchor, SJT is a theory that mainly focuses on the internal processes of a person's own judgment in regards to the relation within a communicated message. The concept was intended to be an explanatory method designed to detail when persuasive messages are most likely to succeed. Attitude change is the fundamental objective of persuasive communication. SJT seeks to specify the conditions under which this change takes place and predict the direction and extent of the attitude change, while attempting to explain how likely a person might be to change his or her opinion, the probable direction of that change, their tolerance toward the opinion of others, and their level of commitment to their position. The SJT researchers claimed expectations regarding attitude change could be based on the message receiver's level of involvement, the structure of the stimulus (and how many alternatives it allows), and the value (credibility) of the source. Development SJT arose from social psychology and was based on laboratory findings resulting from experiments. These experiments studied the mental assessment of physical objects, referred to at the time as psychophysical research. Subjects were asked to compare some aspect of an object, such as weight or color, to another, different object. The researchers discovered that, when a standard was provided for comparison, the participants categorized the objects relative to the aspects of the standard. SJT focuses the conceptual structure of the framework and traces its development from the roots in Brunswik's probabilistic functionalism to its present form. For example, if a very heavy object was used as the standard in assessing weight, then the other objects would be judged to be relatively lighter than if a very light object was used as the standard. The standard is referred to as an \\"anchor\\". This work involving physical objects was applied to psychosocial work, in which a participant's limits of acceptability on social issues are studied. Social issues include areas such as religion and politics. The traditional view of attitude neglects an individual's emotional and motivational influences as well as the social context in which the attitude(s) are formed. Meaning an individual is more likely to assume a speaker with authority will be informative, truthful, relevant, and clear. Wyer and Gruenfeld (1995) noted that \\"much of our theoretical and empirical knowledge about social information processing has been obtained under laboratory conditions that only faintly resemble the social situations in which information is usually acquired in everyday life\\". Judgment process and attitudes Rooted in judgment theory, which is concerned with the discrimination and categorization of stimuli, it attempts to explain how attitudes are expressed, judged, and modified. A judgment occurs when a person compares at least two stimuli and makes a choice about them. With regard to social stimuli specifically, judgment processes incorporate both past experiences and present circumstances. Sherif et al. (1965) defined attitudes as \\"the stands the individual upholds and cherishes about objects, issues, persons, groups, or institutions\\" (p. 4). Researchers must infer attitudes from behavior. The behavior can be in response to arranged or naturally occurring stimuli. True attitudes are fundamental to self-identity and are complex, and thus can be difficult to change. One of the ways in which the SJT developers observed attitudes was through the \\"Own Categories Questionnaire\\". This method requires research participants to place statements into piles of most acceptable, most offensive, neutral, and so on, in order for researchers to infer their attitudes. This categorization, an observable judgment process, was seen by Sherif and Hovland (1961) as a major component of attitude formation. As a judgment process, categorization and attitude formation are a product of recurring instances, so that past experiences influence decisions regarding aspects of the current situation. Therefore, attitudes are acquired. Latitudes of rejection, acceptance, and noncommitment Social judgment theory also illustrates how people contrast their personal positions on issues to others' positions around them. Aside from having their personal opinion, individuals hold latitudes of what they think is acceptable or unacceptable in general for other people's view. Social attitudes are not cumulative, especially regarding issues where the attitude is extreme. This means that a person may not agree with less extreme stands relative to his or her position, even though they may be in the same direction. Furthermore, even though two people may seem to hold identical attitudes, their \\"most preferred\\" and \\"least preferred\\" alternatives may differ. Thus, a person's full attitude can only be understood in terms of what other positions he or she finds acceptable or unacceptable, in addition to his or her own stand. Sherif saw an attitude as amalgam of three zones or latitudes. There is the latitude of acceptance, which is the range of ideas that a person sees as reasonable or worthy of consideration; the latitude of rejection, which is the range of ideas that a person sees as unreasonable or objectionable; and, finally, the latitude of noncommitment, which is the range of ideas that a person sees as neither acceptable nor questionable. These degrees or latitudes together create the full spectrum of an individual's attitude. Sherif and Hovland (1961) define the latitude of acceptance as \\"the range of positions on an issue ... an individual considers acceptable to him (including the one 'most acceptable' to him)\\" (p. 129). On the opposite end of the continuum lies the latitude of rejection. This is defined as including the \\"positions he finds objectionable (including the one 'most objectionable\\" to him)\\". This latitude of rejection was deemed essential by the SJT developers in determining an individual's level of involvement and, thus, his or her propensity to an attitude change. The greater the rejection latitude, the more involved the individual is in the issue and, thus, harder to persuade. In the middle of these opposites lies the latitude of noncommitment, a range of viewpoints where one feels primarily indifferent. Sherif claimed that the greater the discrepancy, the more listeners will adjust their attitudes. Thus, the message that persuades the most is the one that is most discrepant from the listener's position, yet falls within his or her latitude of acceptance or latitude of noncommitment. Assimilation and contrast Sometimes people perceive a message that falls within their latitude of rejection as farther from their anchor than it really is; a phenomenon known as contrast. The opposite of contrast is assimilation, a perceptual error whereby people judge messages that fall within their latitude of acceptance as less discrepant from their anchor than they really are. These latitudes dictate the likelihood of assimilation and contrast. When a discrepant viewpoint is expressed in a communication message within the person's latitude of acceptance, the message is more likely to be assimilated or viewed as being closer to person's anchor, or his or her own viewpoint, than it actually is. When the message is perceived as being very different from one's anchor and, thus, falling within the latitude of rejection, persuasion is unlikely, due to a contrast effect. The contrast effect is what happens when the message is viewed as being further away than it actually is from the anchor. Messages falling within the latitude of noncommitment, however, are the ones most likely to achieve the desired attitude change. Therefore, the more extreme an individual's stand, the greater his or her latitude of rejection and, thus, the harder he or she is to persuade. Ego involvement The SJT researchers speculated that extreme stands, and thus wide latitudes of rejection, were a result of high ego involvement. Ego involvement is the importance or centrality of an issue to a person's life, often demonstrated by membership in a group with a known stand. According to the 1961 Sherif and Hovland work, the level of ego involvement depends upon whether the issue \\"arouses an intense attitude or, rather, whether the individual can regard the issue with some detachment as primarily a 'factual' matter\\" (p. 191). Religion, politics, and family are examples of issues that typically result in highly involved attitudes. They contribute to one's self- identity. The concept of involvement is the crux of SJT. In short, Sherif et al. (1965) speculated that individuals who are highly involved in an issue are more likely to evaluate all possible positions, therefore resulting in an extremely limited or nonexistent latitude of noncommitment. People who have a deep concern or have extreme opinions on either side of the argument always care deeply and have a large latitude of rejection because they already have their strong opinion formed and usually are not willing to change that. High involvement also means that individuals will have a more restricted latitude of acceptance. According to SJT, messages falling within the latitude of rejection are unlikely to successfully persuade. Therefore, highly involved individuals will be harder to persuade, according to SJT. In opposition, individuals who have less care in the issue, or have a smaller ego involvement, are likely to have a large latitude of acceptance. Because they are less educated and do not care as much about the issue, they are more likely to easily accept more ideas or opinions about an issue. This individual will also have a large latitude of noncommitment because, again, if they do not care as much about the topic, they are not going to commit to certain ideas, whether they are on the latitude of rejection or acceptance. An individual who does not have much ego involvement in an issue will have a small latitude of rejection because they are very open to this new issue and do not have previously formed opinions about it. Attitude change To change an attitude, first we must understand the audience's attitudes. Then we will see how it relates to the listeners' judgments of the persuasive messages. It is also essential to judge how close or far away one's position is. The next step is to shift one's position in response to the argument made. An individual adjusts an attitude once he or she has judged a new position to be in his or her latitude of acceptance. If someone judges that message to be in his or her latitude of rejection, they will also adjust their attitude, but in the opposite direction from what they think the speaker is advocating. Sometimes, an attitude change may be incidental. In the boomerang effect, an attitude changes in the opposite direction from what the message advocates‚Äîthe listener is driven away from, rather than drawn to, an idea. This explains why oftentimes fear appeals used in advertising do not work on the audience. As the threat perceived by the audience increases and the capacity to produce the desired effect is low, people will tend to do the opposite of what is advocated. Attitude change can also be influenced by immediate social environment. In the interpersonal domain, people tend to shift their attitudes to align with those of their significant others. The general picture of social influence thus remains one of conformity and alignment attitudes. A major implication of social judgment theory is that persuasion is difficult to accomplish. Successful persuasive messages are those that are targeted to the receiver's latitude of acceptance and discrepant from the anchor position, so that the incoming information cannot be assimilated or contrasted. This suggests that even successful attempts at persuasion will yield only small changes in attitude. SJT also suggests persuasion can occur over time with multiple messages. Simulations SJT has mainly been tested in small experimental settings, only rarely in more extended ways that include an investigation of opinion changes on a collective level in modeling studies. Stefanelli and Seidel conducted a large-scale simulation of SJT, based on real-life data. They collected survey data from 1302 Swiss citizens, regarding their attitudes towards building a deep-ground-repository for nuclear waste. Attitudes were ranked on three scales: risk, benefit, and process. The data was fed into an agent-based social simulation. In each time-period, two random agents were selected to interact. Their opinions on these three topics (risk, benefit and process) were compared. If they were in the latitude of rejection, the opinions were pushed away from each other; otherwise, the opinions were pulled towards each other. The results showed a four-opinion cluster solution, representing four types of opinions: opposing, supporting, ambivalent, and indifferent. Alternative models * Elaboration likelihood model ‚Äì emphasizes the two routes of persuasion ‚Äì central (cognitive arguments) and peripheral (emotional influence). * Social impact theory - emphasizes the number, strength and immediacy of the people trying to influence a person to change their mind.

The radio broadcasting vessel was owned, at that time, by Gordon McLendon and Clint Murchison of Dallas, Texas and leased to a British company for day-to- day operations. While the station was dubbed as a pirate radio station, its actual operation took place within the laws of the day and its offices were located in the heart of the Soho district of London. Its radio advertising sales management was vested in company known as Project Atlanta, Ltd., which had been specifically formed by British political, banking, theatrical and music publishing interests. Origin of the station The on air studio and 10,000 watt AM transmitter of Radio Atlanta were located on board the motor vessel . This radio ship had been originally converted and outfitted (under the name MV Bon Jour) as the home of the offshore Swedish station Radio Nord by the radio interests of Gordon McLendon and financed by fellow Texan Clint Murchison. Jack Kotschack had previously represented the sales operation in Stockholm, Sweden as Radio Nord, and Australian music publisher Allan Crawford represented the sales and programming operation in Britain under the new name of Radio Atlanta. Crawford was doing business and residing in England. Station history :For further information, see Radio Caroline Following the closure of Radio Nord by Swedish legislation, the radio ship sailed for Galveston, Texas where she remained for a year until 1963. The vessel was stripped of its broadcasting equipment. This meant that when Crawford finally managed to acquire the ship, it was necessary to refit it as a radio station.This is at variance to information previously recorded under Radio Nord. See Talk:Radio Atlanta Crawford's backers included his friend the translator Dorothy Black. Meanwhile, Ronan O'Rahilly had acquired the Mclendon business plan from Crawford and showed it to associates of Jocelyn Stevens, and used the blueprint to create another station called Radio Caroline. O'Rahilly offered Crawford the use of the O'Rahilly family port at Greenore in Ireland in exchange for use of the Crawford recording studio for the venture represented by O'Rahilly. Both Crawford and O'Rahilly admit that, while the two ships were being fitted out, numerous acts of mutual sabotage occurred, with each company doing its best to delay the other's launch. The Mi Amigo was first to leave Greenore, but problems with the rigging supporting its antenna mast meant that the ship had to put in at Falmouth for repairs, and because of this delay Radio Caroline went on air first, on 28 March 1964. Radio Atlanta began test broadcasts on 12 May 1964. Its earliest tests were on 1520 kHz (197 metres), the same frequency as Caroline, after Caroline's evening closedown and were clearly intended to steal Caroline's audience. Official programming began shortly afterward on 1493 kHz (201 metres). The DJs never referred to the Mi Amigo by name, but as \\"The Good Ship Radio Atlanta\\". The majority of Radio Atlanta's programmes were pre-recorded in London and were rushed out to the ship for transmission on the same day or the next. On occasions when bad weather made this impossible, the onboard DJs had to present more live shows. Radio Atlanta remained on the air for less than 2 months, until 2 July 1964. Audiences and advertising revenue had not lived up to expectations, and Crawford was reluctantly forced to join with O'Rahilly's Caroline, and become Radio Caroline South. Crawford remained in charge of Caroline South until late 1965, when he left and O'Rahilly took overall control of both Carolines. After Atlanta Crawford's \\"Project Atlanta\\" remained in control of Caroline South until late 1965, but the station continued to lose ground as new stations came on the air, notably Radio London. Eventually Crawford pulled out, leaving O'Rahilly in charge of both Caroline ships, and Caroline South's audience figures improved under its new management.

He is a former Liberal Cabinet Minister in the government of Jean Chr√©tien. Cauchon was born in La Malbaie, Quebec and studied law at the University of Ottawa and the University of Exeter. He worked as a lawyer from 1985 to 1993, and from 2004 to present. Cauchon was a partner with the now- defunct law firm of Heenan Blaikie. He is also a Vice-Chairman of the Canada China Business Council. He unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada in 2013. Politics Cauchon first ran for public office in the 1988 federal election when he challenged Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in the riding of Charlevoix, however he was unsuccessful in this bid. In the 1993 federal election Cauchon once again sought a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. In this election he was elected in the Montreal riding of Outremont, he was re-elected in the 1997 and 2000 elections. Cauchon was appointed Secretary of State for the Federal Office of Regional Development - Quebec by Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien in 1996. He became a full cabinet minister in 1999 when he was given the position of Minister of National Revenue. On January 15, 2002, he became Minister of Justice and Quebec lieutenant. As justice minister, Cauchon argued in cabinet in favour of same- sex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana (indeed, when asked whether he had used marijuana in the past, he responded \\"Yes, of course\\"). Cauchon during 2010. In 2009, Cauchon indicated he was interested in re- entering politics and running in his former riding of Outremont, which was then held by New Democratic Party (NDP) Deputy Leader Thomas Mulcair. The Liberal Party's Quebec Lieutenant Denis Coderre, who was tasked with finding Quebec candidates for the next election, announced that the riding was closed off to Cauchon and was being reserved for a female candidate. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff originally sided with Coderre in opposing Cauchon return, and instead planned to appoint prominent businesswoman Nathalie le Prohon as the candidate in the riding. However, after facing pressure from within his caucus Ignatieff reversed his earlier decision and decide to allow Cauchon to seek the nomination, after Le Prohon indicated she would seek the Liberal nomination in Jeanne-Le Ber. The controversy over the nomination led to Coderre's resignation as the Liberal's Quebec Lieutenant and Defence Critic, saying he no longer had the \\"moral authority\\" to continue. In the federal election held on May 2, 2011, Cauchon was unsuccessful in his bid to unseat Mulcair. The NDP's support in Quebec, and throughout most of Canada, had surged in the final weeks of the campaign, at the expense of the Liberals and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. The NDP won 59 seats in Quebec and replaced the Liberals as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. Ignatieff had also failed in his bid to win re-election and resigned as party leader days later. Leadership Cauchon during a Liberal Party candidates debate on February 16, 2013 Cauchon was a Chr√©tien loyalist and opposed Paul Martin's attempt to force Chr√©tien to retire. When Chr√©tien announced his resignation, Cauchon was touted as a possible candidate to succeed him but did not end up running in the 2003 leadership election. Cauchon refused to back Martin's leadership bid, and decided to support John Manley. Martin was elected leader and did not include Cauchon in his cabinet. Following this he announced he would not seek re-election in the 2004 federal election. Cauchon was considered a potential candidate in both the 2006 and 2009 Liberal leadership elections, however in both cases he announced he would not run. In 2006, he endorsed former Ontario Premier Bob Rae who placed third. At the Liberal Party's 2012 biennial convention, Cauchon hosted a hospitality suite leading to speculation that he was interested in running for leader in the 2013 leadership election. In December 2012, it was reported that Cauchon was planning a lately entry into the race after some Liberals feared the top tier of contenders were supporting right-wing policies. On the last weekend before the registration cutoff on January 14, 2013, Cauchon was trying to gather the 300 signatures needed to enter the leadership race. Fellow leadership contender David Bertschi sent out an email to Liberals asking for their help to get enough signatures so that Cauchon could enter the contest. On April 14, 2013, he lost the leadership election to Montreal MP Justin Trudeau. Legal-post political career Prior to his political career, Cauchon practised law in civil and commercial litigation from 1985 to 1993. Following his exit from politics Cauchon returned to practicing law. From 2004 to 2012 he practised commercial law at Gowling Lafleur Henderson. In February 2012, Cauchon joined the firm of Heenan Blaikie in Montreal. He is also part of a management team operating a proposed medical marijuana growing business near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Between March 2015 and August 2019, he also bought from the Desmarais family the newspaper chain that he baptized Groupe Capitales M√©dias (Le Nouvelliste, Le Quotidien, Le Soleil, La Tribune , La Voix de l'est and Ontario-based Le Droit) and he asked Claude Gagnon to manage it for him.

His last name is Russian for both \\"colour\\" and is the root word of \\"flower.\\" Biography Mikhail Tsvet was born 14 May 1872 in Asti, Italy. His mother was Italian, and his father was a Russian official. His mother died soon after his birth, and he was raised in Geneva, Switzerland. He received his BS degree from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Geneva in 1893. However, he decided to dedicate himself to botany and received his PhD degree in 1896 for his work on cell physiology. He moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1896 because his father was recalled from the foreign service. There he started to work at the Biological Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. His Geneva degrees were not recognized in Russia, and he had to earn Russian degrees. In 1897 he became a teacher of botany courses for women. In 1902 he became a laboratory assistant at the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Warsaw University in Poland. In 1903 he became an assistant professor and taught also at other Warsaw universities. After the beginning of World War I the Warsaw University of Technology was evacuated to Moscow, Russia, and in 1916 again to Gorki near Moscow. In 1917 he became a Professor of Botany and the director of the botanical gardens at the University of Tartu (Yuryev) in Estonia. In 1918 when German troops occupied the city, the university was evacuated to Voronezh, a large city in the south of Central Russia. Tsvet died of a chronic inflammation of the throat on 26 June 1919 at the age of 47.

(Note: Tsvet submitted his manuscript in 1903; however, it was not published until 1905.) He first used the term \\"chromatography\\" in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, Berichte der Deutschen botanischen Gesellschaft.. On page 322, Tsvet coins the term \\"chromatography\\": Original : \\"Wird eine petrol√§therishe Chlorophyll√∂sung durch eine S√§ule eines Adsorptionsmittels durchfiltriert (ich verwende haupts√§chlich Calciumcarbonate, welches in engen Glasr√∂hren dicht gestampft wird), so werden die Farbstoffe gem√§ss der Adsorptionsreihe von oben nach unten in verschieden gef√§rbten Zonen auseinandergelegt, indem die st√§rker adsorbierten Farbstoffe die schw√§cher zur√ºckgehaltenen weiter nach unten verdr√§ngen. Diese Trennung wird praktisch vollst√§ndig, wenn man nach dem Durchgange der Farbstoffl√∂sung durch die adsorbierende S√§ule einen Strom des reinen L√∂sungsmittels herstellt. Wie die Lichtstrahlen im Spektrum, so werden in der Calciumkarbonats√§ule die verschiedenen Komponenten eines Farbstoffgemisches gesetzm√§ssig auseindergelegt, und lassen sich darin qualitativ und auch quantitativ bestimmen. Ein solches Pr√§parat nenne ich ein Chromatogramm und die entsprechende Methode, die chromatographische Methode.\\" Translation : If a solution of chlorophyll in petroleum ether is filtered through a column of an adsorbent (I use mainly calcium carbonate, which is tamped firmly in narrow glass tubes), then the pigments are dispersed, according to the adsorption series, from top to bottom in differently colored zones, by the more strongly adsorbed pigments' displacing farther downwards the more weakly retained ones. This separation is practically complete when one establishes a flow of pure solvent behind the passage of the pigment solution through the adsorbing column. Like light rays in a spectrum, so the different components of a mixture of pigments are dispersed in the calcium carbonate column following a set pattern, and [they] can be determined in there qualitatively as well as quantitatively. I call such a preparation a \\"chromatogram\\" and the corresponding method, the \\"chromatographic method\\". In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society. For several reasons, Tsvet's work was long ignored: the violent political upheaval in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, the fact that Tsvet originally published only in Russian (making his results largely inaccessible to western scientists), and an article denying Tsvet's findings. Richard Willst√§tter and Arthur Stoll tried to repeat Tsvet's experiments, but because they used an overly aggressive adsorbent (destroying the chlorophyll), were not able to do so. On pages 323‚Äì324, Willst√§tter and Stoll state their objections to Tsvet's chromatographic methods: \\"Die chromatographische Adsorptionsanalyse, die in den H√§nden von M. Tswett1) zu wichtigen Resultaten hinsichtlich des Chlorophylls und seiner Derivate gef√ºhrt hat, halten wir f√ºr die Arbeit in gr√∂√üerem Ma√üstab, also f√ºr pr√§parative Zwecke nicht f√ºr brauchbar. Die freien Chlorophyllide sind zu unbest√§ndig ; ihre Farbe schl√§gt leicht in braun um, wenn sie von Adsorbentien aufgenommen werden. Aber selbst die Methylchlorophyllide sind zu empfindlich, so da√ü es noch weiter Verbesserungen2) des Tswettschen Verfahrens bedarf, um sie nach diesem wieder unver√§ndert zu isolieren. Beim Adsorbieren mit Calciumcarbonat und beim Ausziehen mit Alkohol unterliegen alle Chlorophyllide, wie wir in unseren letzten Arbeiten beschreiben haben1), leicht der Umwandlung, die sich bei der Verseifung mit Alkalien durch Auftreten schwach basischer Phytochlorine und Phytorhodine verr√§t. Es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob bei der Tswettschen Adsorptionsanalyse in kleinem Ma√üstab diese Ver√§nderung der Magnesiumverbindungen vermieden worden ist.\\" (Chromatographic adsorption analysis, which in the hands of M. Tsvet has led to important results regarding chlorophyll and its derivatives, we hold to be unsuitable for work on a larger scale, thus, for preparative purposes. Free chlorophyllides are too unstable ; their colors turn brown readily when they are adsorbed. But even methylchlorophyllides are too sensitive, so that still further improvements of Tsvet's method are needed in order to isolate them unchanged by this [method]. During adsorption by calcium carbonate and during extraction with alcohol, all chlorophyllides succumb, as we described in our latest articles, readily to the transformation, which betrays itself during hydrolysis with alkalies by the appearance of weakly basic phytochlorine and phytorhodine. It's still not known whether in the case of Tsvet's adsorption analysis ([which functions] on a small scale), this change of the magnesium compounds has been avoided.) They published their results and Tsvet's chromatography method fell into obscurity. It was revived 10 years after his death thanks to Austrian biochemist Richard Kuhn and his student, German scientist Edgar Lederer as well as the work of A. J. Martin and R. L. Synge.

Today the remainder of the company is owned by Pfizer. In 1997, Pharmacia & Upjohn sold several brands to Johnson & Johnson, including Motrin and Cortaid. History Amersham In 1997 the biotechnology division of the company Pharmacia Biotech merged with Amersham Life Science with the new merged entity being known as Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Pharmacia name was later dropped when Pharmacia & Upjohn sold its share of the company to Amersham plc, with the company being renamed Amersham Biosciences in 2001. In 2004 Amersham Biosciences was acquired by GE Healthcare. The Life sciences division of GE Healthcare still has its headquarters in Uppsala. In 1999, the nutrition division of the company was sold to Fresenius. Monsanto Monsanto acquired the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle & Company in 1985. A decade later the revamped subsidiary Searle and the Monsanto Pharma Sector invented and developed celecoxib. Branded as Celebrex, celecoxib is an anti- inflammatory drug that became widely used soon after its approval by the FDA at the end of 1998. In December 1999 Pharmacia & Upjohn merged with the American biotechnology and medical company, Monsanto and renamed itself Pharmacia; the company retained Monsanto's pharmaceutical division - then known as Searle - and spun off the remaining interests (mainly agriculture and biotechnological assets), which became known as the \\"new Monsanto\\". The newly merged entity then changed its name again, being known as Pharmacia Corp. Pfizer In July 2002, Pharmacia Corp. and Pfizer announced an agreement that Pfizer would purchase Pharmacia; control of celecoxib was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia.Andrew Ross Sorkin for the New York Times, July 15, 2002.

Morgan is known outside Australia as a song writing collaborator of Evan Dando and his band, the Lemonheads. In 1994 Duncan was replaced on bass guitar by Adam Yee and in 1997 Pete Kelly joined on guitar. Smudge signed with Half a Cow to issue four studio albums, Manilow (1994), Hot Smoke and Sassafras (1994), You Me Carpark . . . Now (1996) and Real McCoy Wrong Sinatra (1998), before going into hiatus from late 1999. Since 2002, Smudge play a few times a year. There has been no new music since 1998.  History  Smudge were formed in 1991 in Sydney by Paul Duncan on bass guitar, Alison Galloway on drums and Tom Morgan on guitar and vocals. Galloway and Morgan were also band mates in Godstar alongside Nic Dalton, who was the co-owner of the record label, Half a Cow.McFarlane, 'Godstar' entry. Archived from the original on 7 August 2004. Retrieved 3 June 2017. Duncan and Morgan were former school friends. Smudge had formed after Galloway and Morgan were asked by Dalton to contribute a song, \\"Tea, Toast and Turmoil\\", to the 1991 Half a Cow 7\\" four-track split extended play, Slice (with one track each from Swirl, Jupiter and Studley Lush). The group's first gig was at the Lansdowne Hotel ‚Äì where Galloway had worked as a barmaid ‚Äì to launch the EP. An Oz Music Project reporter described Smudge's track as \\"a short, melodic pop song with colourful lyrics which set the blueprint for the future output of [the band].\\" In mid-year Morgan met Evan Dando (of the Lemonheads) via Dalton; Morgan and Dando subsequently developed a song writing partnership. Smudge appeared at the inaugural Big Day Out, January 1992 in Sydney. They released a 7\\" single, \\"Don't Want to Be Grant McLennan\\" (referencing the Go-Between's Grant McLennan) in March of that year, which was also issued on a four-track EP of the same name. It was named by John Peel as his record of the week and NME provided a favourable review. Love Lust & Lemonjuice (September 1992), their second EP, included the track, \\"Divan\\". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the two EPs demonstrated \\"rough-hewn yet sprightly power pop wrapped around witty lyrics, squalling, fuzzy guitars, urgent melodies and grungy production.\\" They followed with a third EP, Superhero, in May 1993, which included covers of the Laverne & Shirley theme \\"Making Our Dreams Come True\\" and John Waite's \\"Missing You\\". Steve Bell of theMusic.com.au observed that they had \\"by this time released a string of catchy, infectious EPs ... so from the outset there was a lot more going on in the Smudge world than mere association or nepotism.\\" In 1993 the group issued a compilation album, Tea, Toast & Turmoil, for the international market on Canadian label Shake/Cargo. It contained material from their three Australian EPs and Various Artists' compilations. In 1994 Duncan was replaced by Adam Yee on bass guitar (ex-Headache). In March of that year the band released its debut album, Manilow, produced by Dalton, on Half a Cow records. The first single from the album, \\"Impractical Joke\\" (November 1993), was released in three different countries, each with different B-sides culled from a number of home-made four-track recordings conducted independently by each of the band members. Twenty years later Morgan recalled \\"we did alright with the EPs and stuff, I guess... I think we already had three EPs plus a compilation for overseas, so [Manilow] was our first proper album. It was done pretty quickly, in about five days or something. [Dalton] was producing ‚Äì he was there every day. He played guitar on a couple of songs, plus helped us with some arrangements and stuff. It was such a long time ago.\\" In October 1996 they released their second album, You, Me, Carpark...Now!, which was recorded at Idful Studios in Chicago, with producer Casey Rice (Liz Phair, Dirty Three) and number of additional studio musicians, including John McEntire (Tortoise). The release saw a more mature and decisively less lo-fi sound. The album provided \\"Mike Love, Not War\\" as a single in April, with the cover art featuring a parody of the Beach Boys' album, Pet Sounds. Its second single was a three track, \\"Slight Return\\", in August. In 1997 the band released a compilation of rarities, Mo Poontang. During 1997-1998 the band had two guitars in line-up ‚Äì Pete Kelly (ex- Disneyfist, Sea Life Park, Decoder Ring) joined the band on second guitar and helped record the band's fourth album, Real McCoy, Wrong Sinatra. It was recorded in a home built eight-track studio in Gerroa, New South Wales, which peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Music Report's Top 10 Localternative Albums. From late October 1999 until 2002 the band went on an extended hiatus while drummer Alison Galloway went trekking across the world. She joined Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, Into the Light Again, in October 2004, but she had already left that band before it appeared. The band re-united for a limited number of performances in Sydney and Melbourne at the end of 2004. In October 2008 they again performed together at the inaugural Sounds of Spring Festival in Brisbane which was followed by two performances in Melbourne the following weekend. In August 2010 the band released a compilation album, This Smudge is True. In November and December that year they supported The Lemonheads on an Australian tour playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album It's a Shame about Ray, plus a selection of songs from other albums. Morgan and Galloway played with Dando in the encore performance of \\"The Outdoor Type\\". Smudge performed as part of the lineup for the 2011 Big Day Out Festival.

Hebr. Books Brit. Mus. pp. 179, 555.SLibrary of Congress Authorities: Volozhiner, ·∏§ayyim ben Isaac, 1749‚Äì1821 was a rabbi, Talmudist, and ethicist. Popularly known as \\"Reb Chaim Volozhiner\\" or simply as \\"Reb Chaim\\", he was born in Volozhin (a.k.a. Va≈Ço≈æyn or Valozhyn) when it was a part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. He died there while it was under the control of the Russian Empire. The title of his major work is . Student of the Vilna Gaon Both Chaim and his elder brother Simcha (d. 1812) studied under Rabbi Aryeh Leib ben Asher Gunzberg, the author of the Shaagas Aryeh, who was then rabbi of Volozhin, and afterward under Rabbi Raphael ha-Kohen, (the author of the Toras Yekusiel), later of Hamburg. Aged 25, Chaim was attracted by the fame of the Vilna Gaon, and he became one of his most prominent disciples. Submitting to his new teacher's method, he began his studies anew, taking up again Torah, Mishnah, Talmud, and even Hebrew grammar. His admiration for the gaon was boundless, and after his death Chaim virtually acknowledged no superior (see Heschel Levin's \\"Aliyyot Eliyahu\\", pp. 55‚Äì56, Vilna, 1889 ). Establishing the Volozhin Yeshiva Photo of the Volozhin Yeshiva Tombstone of Chaim of Volozhin It was with the view of applying the methods of the Vilna Gaon that Chaim founded the Volozhin yeshiva, then called Yeshivat Etz Chaim, in 1803, a yeshiva that remained in operation for nearly 90 years until it was closed in 1892. The yeshiva became the \\"mother of all Lithuanian-style yeshivas\\". He began with ten pupils, young residents of Volozhin, whom Chaim maintained at his own expense. It is related that his wife sold her jewelry to contribute to their maintenance. The fame of the institution spread, and the number of its students increased, necessitating an appeal to which the Jews of Russia generously responded. Rabbi Chaim lived to see his yeshiva housed in its own building, and to preside over a hundred disciples (\\"Chut ha-Meshullash,\\" responsum No. 5, published by his great-grandson ). He saw one of his students establish his own yeshiva, Mir yeshiva. Chaim continued to teach the Vilna Gaon's study method of penetrating analysis of the Talmudic text, seeking to elicit the intent and meaning of the writing of the Rishonim. This approach was followed by all the great Lithuanian yeshivas, such as Slobodka yeshiva, Mir yeshiva, Ponevezh yeshiva, Kelm yeshiva, Kletsk yeshiva, and Telz yeshiva. Works Cover page of book of Chaim of Volozhin's Responsa, Chut HaMeshulash, published in 1882 Chaim's major work is the Nefesh Ha-Chaim (\\"Living Soul\\"). Contrary to popular belief, it does not deal solely with complex understandings of the nature of God, but also with secrets of prayer and the importance of Torah, the purpose being \\"to implant the fear of God, Torah, and pure worship into the hearts of the upright who are seeking the ways of God\\". It presents a clear and orderly kabbalistic Weltanschauung that addresses many of the same issues as the Hasidic texts of the day. Norman Lamm described its structure: In addition, Chaim wrote Ruach Chaim , a commentary on Pirkei Avoth. Both titles also play on his name, \\"Chaim\\". Thus, for example, \\"The Spirit of Life\\" can also be translated as \\"Chaim's Spirit\\" or \\"Chaim's Soul\\". Many of Chaim's responsa on halakic subjects were lost by fire in 1815. Family The \\"Netziv\\" Shimon Peres, standing third from right, with members of his family some time between 1920-1930 Chaim's brother, known as Zalman of Volozhin, is considered to have been among the greatest students of the Vilna Gaon.

Lord Shirgul Temple is one of the most famous temples in North India. Lord Shirgul is worshipped in Sirmaur, Solan, Shimla, Uttaranchal, and Delhi. Thick Deodar forests are visited by tourists from many parts of India. A trek leads to Churdhar, the Holy place of Lord Shiva. Churdhar A View (2016) The Chur Peak in district Sirmmaur rises to an elevation of 3647 m above the sea level. The mountain is an important religious place for all Sirmauries. It is one of the Shivalik ranges at a height of 11965 feet, and is the highest peak in southern Himachal Pradesh. Churdhar, also known as Churchandni (Bangle of Snow), is known for its spectacular landscapes. The view from the summit offers a panorama of lowland tracts towards the south and snow-capped ranges, including the peaks of Badrinath and Kedarnath in the Garhwal region, towards the north. It is believed that this is the very place where Hanuman discovered the life- restoring Sanjivini booti, which revived Lakshmana, Lord Rama‚Äôs younger brother. Ruins of an ancient town have been discovered at the nearby dundi Devi. Herbs and alpine flora cover these Himalayan slopes, and fauna include the monal, Himachal‚Äôs state bird, along with koklass and kaleej pheasants. Trekkers tread over small glaciers on their way to Churdhar summit, which has moderate to heavy snowfall (average of 33 feet snow). Often the Shirgul temple gets buried under it. On clear sunny days, the Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines, Gangetic plains, the Sutlej river and hills of Shimla and Chakrata can be seen. Atop the Churdhar summit there are lingams of Shiva and Kali, where goat and sheep were formerly sacrificed. Devotees hoist flags and make offerings here. The peak can be approached from Dadahu, headquarter of Renuka tehsil, via Sangrah, Bhawai, Gandhuri and Naura, at a distance of about by bridle path. Another approach to the peak is by the Solan Rajgarh Menus road. Renuka Ji Renuka is another place of religious and tourist interest in Sirmaur. It is nearly from Nahan via a motorable metalled road. Boating is not available for visitors at Renuka Lake, an oval-shaped lake with a circumference of . The lake is visited by thousand of pilgrims every year on Kartiki Ekadashi. There is a patch between the Giri and humming camp where visitors often stay for a couple of days. Nightlong festivities including Kirtans are held by various groups. The place reaches full capacity during the days of the fair and offers a variety of activities. At the entrance to the fairground there is a notice board put up by the Wild Life Wing of the Forest Department warning, \\"Hold Your Gun--Game Sanctuary Starts\\". To this fair, the brass idol of Parasu Rama is brought from the village Jamu, his permanent abode, in a silver palki accompanied by musical instruments. The deity remains in the temple for three days i.e. sudi, dashmi to dwadashi (from 10th to 12th of the bright half). The hill people pray to pujari with questions during the night when he goes into a trance and turns into an oracle, answering questions and sometimes asking of the questioner some offering or sacrifice to the deity of some other act as a condition precedent to the fulfillment of the favourable prophecy, such as deliverance from a problem or recovery of health from some disease. On Dwadashi, generally, the people offer alms after the holy dip in the Renuka. Chanpur Dhar Chanpur Dhar is another place that is undiscovered by trekkers and tourists. Although the locals have been visiting the temple dedicated to Shirgul Devta from time to time but the place still lacks attention of the government. It is almost an 8 kilometers trek from Dhevthal bus stop and takes maximum 4 hours to reach at the top to the Shirgul Devta temple. Haripur Dhar This place is at an elevation of 2687 m. Maa Bhangayani Temple, Haripurdhar, is a well known temple in Sirmaur. Haripur is the name applied to a mountain called Haripur Dhar. A fort on a peak of this hillwas built on this range of mountain by the rulers of erstwhile Sirmur State. It was primarily meant to guard the state frontiers with the neighbouring Jubbal State as there were constant boundary disputes between the two states and there was an unusual encroachment into each other's territory. It has fallen into disuse and the part which is still habitable is used by the Forest Department as forester‚Äôs headquarters. The fort reminds the visitor of the historical period when to hold or capture such forts used to be the chief aim of the contending hill states. At a distance of about from Nahan, Haripurdhar can be approached by a regular bus service covering up to Dadahu, wherefrom Andheri can be reached by jeep for about . The remaining portion is about . Another way to approach is from Solan via Rajgarh. Kharotiyon, a place from where the site of the fort remains about on the hill top.

Sundarnagar is one of the emerging towns of the district. The main native language is Mandeali. As of 2011 it is the second most populous district of Himachal Pradesh (out of 12), after Kangra. History and geography The Beas, Mandi. Mandi district was formed after the merger of Mandi State (Mandi) and Suket State, two princely states on 15 April 1948. This coincided with the formation of the Union territory of Himachal Pradesh. The state attained its full statehood later. Mandi town was named after its resident saint Mandavya Rishi. Mandi is almost at the geographical centre of Himachal, lying along the left bank of the river Beas in the foothills of Shivalik ranges. The town has an altitude of 760 metres (2,495 ft) from the sea level. Comprising the two erstwhile states of Mandi and Suket, Mandi derives its name 'mandi' or 'market' as it was a major trade route from Ladakh to locations in Punjab such as Hoshiarpur and other places. Here, during the days of yore, the pious rishi, Mandavaya, performed long and severe penance and practised austerities on his body, on the bank of the river Beas, near the present Mandi town.

The exterior of the Old Fox Chase Hotel, long a familiar landmark at the bending intersection of Oxford Avenue and Pine Road, near Rhawn. The hotel, built in 1705, developed a thriving stagecoach business with the opening of the Fox Chase and Huntingdon Turnpike in 1848. Before 1870 it was owned by Elijah Hoffman, who operated it for many years. The hotel was sold and razed in 1940 to make way for a gasoline station. History Fox Chase was originally part of Lower Dublin Township, also known as Dublin Township, a defunct township that was located in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The township ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. Philadelphia's elite once flocked to opulent vacation homes built in the lush fringes bordering the city. The area's character changed with the arrival of the railroad in 1876. Many of Philadelphia's aristocracy began to discover the attractiveness of suburban living, and built mansions here, using the railroad for convenient transport into the city. Fox Chase was the setting for one of America's longest running cold cases. In February 1957, the battered body of a small boy was found in a cardboard box off in the woods off Susquehanna Road. Investigators were mystified and have never been able to determine his identity. Nicknamed \\"The Boy in the Box\\", \\"America's Unknown Child\\", and sometimes \\"The Fox Chase Boy\\", his case remains open. Location and surrounding areas The Fox Chase section is located on the border with Montgomery County and there is an active and cooperative business community that crosses the county line into Rockledge and Huntingdon Valley. Pennypack Park in Fox Chase One of many parks located within Fox Chase is Pennypack Park. It is composed of woodlands, meadows and wetlands. The banks of the Pennypack Creek runs through the park from Pine Road in Fox Chase all the way to the Delaware River. The area also includes playgrounds, hiking and bike trails as well as bridle paths for horseback riding. The Pennypack Environmental Center on Verree Road is also located within the neighborhood. Many historic structures are still intact throughout Fox Chase. The Verree House on Verree Road was the site of a raid by British troops during the American Revolutionary War. The trained eye can rediscover abandoned railroad grades, remnants of early mills, mill races and other reminders that generations of mankind have gathered in the \\"Green Heart\\" of Northeast Philadelphia. Fox Chase Farm seen from Pine RoadFox Chase Farm is one of the few remaining active farms in Philadelphia County and is used extensively by the School District of Philadelphia. It began in 1822 as a land grant from William Penn to Lord Stanley and then passed to the McVeigh family for over 200 years. Later, the Wistar family developed it into a self- sufficient farm until it became a Gentlemen's Farm owned by two farmers, Lorimer and Butler. Friends of Fox Chase Farm, an all-volunteer group, currently assists in maintaining and preserving this pastoral treasure for present and future generations. William Rhawn, president of the National Bank of the Republic in 1879, built a summer residence here. To design the project, he chose architect Frank Furness, whose work was synonymous with the mansions and public buildings of the Gilded Age. The banker's country estate includes a carriage house and gatekeeper's house. He called the estate ‚ÄúKnowlton‚Äù because it resembled estate in England of Rhawn's wife's great-grandfather, John Knowles. It has since been converted into a catering establishment. Oxford Avenue and Rhawn Street in Fox ChaseRyerss Mansion is also located in Fox Chase. The house was built by merchant Joseph Waln Ryerss in 1859 and dramatically overlooks Burholme Park, one of the highest vistas in Philadelphia. The mansion is home to a massive and eccentric collection of artifacts and antiquities from around the world, collected during the Ryerss family's extensive travels and exotic sojourns, from Europe, to Africa, to the Far East. Among the historic properties located in this neighborhood are: * Knowlton Mansion, designed by Frank Furness; on the National Register of Historic Places * Ryerss Mansion, home of Joseph Waln Ryerss; on the National Register of Historic Places * The Verree House, site of a raid by British troops during the American Revolutionary War Demographics The median age is 36.6 years for males and 39.0 years for females.

He was a noted authority on stratigraphy and had an influential role in the development of paleontology in the United States. Early life James Hall was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, the oldest of four children. His parents, James Hall Sr. and Sousanna Dourdain Hall, had emigrated from England two years earlier. Hall developed an early interest in science and enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a recently established college that emphasized student participation and focused on science. He was a student of Amos Eaton and Ebenezer Emmons, both notable geologists. Hall graduated with honors in 1832, received his master's degree in 1833, and remained at Rensselaer to teach chemistry and later geology. In 1836 a multi-year survey was established to collect information on the geology and natural history of New York.New York State Geological Survey . For purposes of the survey, the state was divided into four districts, and Hall became assistant geologist for Ebenezer Emmons, chief of the Second District. Hall‚Äôs initial assignment was to study iron deposits in the Adirondack Mountains. The following year the survey was reorganized: Hall was put in charge of the Fourth District, in western New York. Other notable geologists working on the survey included Lardner Vanuxem and Timothy Conrad. Working together, the survey staff developed a stratigraphy for New York and set a precedent for naming stratigraphic divisions based on local geography. At the end of the survey in 1841, Hall was named the first state paleontologist. In 1843 he made his final report on the survey of the fourth geological district, which was published as Geology of New York, Part IV. (1843). It was received with much acclaim and became a classic in the field. Hall had built a solid reputation and was to devote the rest of his life to stratigraphic geology and invertebrate paleontology. alt=A small brick building with white paint flaking off in spots, green trim, a gently sloping gabled roof and low tower behind the right corner. Hall built a laboratory in Albany, New York, which became an important center of study and training for aspiring geologists and paleontologists. Many notable scientists began their career serving an apprenticeship with Hall, including Fielding Meek, Charles Walcott, Charles Beecher and Josiah Whitney. Now known as the James Hall Office, the laboratory was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Among his many works, James Hall identified that stromatolite fossils discovered at Petrified Sea Gardens, a site near Saratoga Springs, New York that is now also a National Historic Landmark, were originally organic. and Later years After his work in New York, Hall extended his studies to other regions of the country. In 1850 Hall participated in a geological survey of northern Michigan and Wisconsin, where he identified the first fossil reefs ever found in North America. He was appointed state geologist for Iowa (1855‚Äì1858) and Wisconsin (1857‚Äì1860). In addition, several other state survey programs sought out Hall for his expertise and advice. In 1866 he was made director of the New York State Museum of Natural History in Albany. In 1893 he was appointed the State Geologist of New York. Between 1847 and 1894 Hall published 13 volumes of The Palaeontology of New York, his principal contribution in the field. This massive work consisted of over 4500 pages and 1000 full-page illustrations. In addition, Hall wrote more than 30 other books, published over 1000 works, and contributed sections to several federal and state publications on geology. He was a founding member of the National Academy of Sciences and the first president of the Geological Society of America.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society, . He was one of the founders of the International Geologic Congress and served as a vice-president at their sessions in Paris, Bologna, and Berlin. He was elected one of the fifty foreign members of the Geological Society of London in 1848, and in 1858 was awarded its Wollaston Medal. In 1884 he was elected correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences. At the age of 85 he traveled to St. Petersburg to attend the International Geological Congress and also participate in an expedition to the Ural Mountains. Hall died two years later in Bethlehem, New Hampshire. He is buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery, Albany, New York. A residence hall at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is named after James Hall. It is officially known as Hall Hall. Family In 1838 Hall married Sarah Aikin, the daughter of a Troy lawyer. They had two daughters and two sons. Sarah helped illustrate some of Hall's publications. In 1849 she published an illustrated book of poetry, Phantasia, and other poems. Included in this volume was her English translation of Schiller's Ritter Toggenburg.

He also had a recurring role as Colonel Danby in the long-running radio soap opera The Archers. Perhaps Shelley's single best-known role was as Winnie-the- Pooh in Children's Hour adaptations of A.A. Milne's stories; for many British people of the mid-20th century, his is the definitive voice of Pooh. Other roles for Children's Hour included Dr. Watson (opposite Carleton Hobbs as Holmes) in the 1952‚Äì1969 Sherlock Holmes radio series; Toad in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows; and the roles of The Magician and Captain Higgins in the specially written Toytown series. Shelley also played the parts of Gandalf and Tom Bombadil in the 1955-6 radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In the 1973 BBC television series Jack the Ripper Shelley played Detective Constable Walter Dew.  Life and career  Shelley was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Frank Shelley, a painter, and his wife, Alice Campbell, n√©e Glover. He originally intended to make a career as an aircraft designer,Ian Hartley, Goodnight children...everywhere Midas Books: Hippocrene Books, New York: 1983; p. 42 but took up stage acting on the advice of the actress and teacher Rosina Fillipi. His public debut was at the Old Vic in 1919, and in the early 1920s he toured with the Charles Doran Shakespeare Company, performing such roles as Trebonius in Julius Caesar and Sebastian in Twelfth Night. During the 1920s and early '30s he worked principally in London, and was particularly associated with Peter Godfrey's experimental productions at the Gate Theatre Studio. Shelley's first BBC broadcast was in 1926, having earlier made a reputation in radio in Australia and New Zealand. By the late '30s he established a reputation as a respected and versatile British radio actor. In 1937 he married Monica Daphne, n√©e Brett. During the Second World War he was a member of the BBC's wartime repertory company, but left to serve as a ferry pilot in the Air Transport Auxiliary. In the 1930s and '40s he was a Children's Hour regular, famous as Dennis the Dachshund in Toytown, and as Winnie-the-Pooh, whom he first played in 1939. He played Dr Watson to Carleton Hobbs's Sherlock Holmes from October 1952 to July 1969. In the late 1950s he took part in recorded dramatised versions by Argo Records of Alice in Wonderland (1958) and Through the Looking-Glass, both directed by Douglas Cleverdon and both starring Jane Asher in the title role. For the same company he also recorded his impersonation of Toad in Wind in the Willows (1960) with Richard Goolden as Mole. Late in life he found new fame as Colonel Freddy Danby in the BBC radio serial The Archers. He was still recording episodes of The Archers at the time of his death. He collapsed suddenly at Finchley Road tube station, London, on 21 August 1980, and was declared dead in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead. His wife had predeceased him; he was buried near her at Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire, on 28 August.  Churchill impersonation  A recurring rumour holds that, because the House of Commons was not at the time set up for location recording, some of Winston Churchill's most famous speeches to Parliament during the Second World War were subsequently recorded for radio broadcast not by Churchill, but by Shelley impersonating Churchill. The rumour has been promoted by David Irving to support his unflattering view of Churchill. It is difficult to prove or disprove Irving's claims. Analysis of voice patterns in 20 of Churchill's recorded speeches show that three made in May and June 1940 do not match those provably by him, although Churchill might have recorded them after his voice had changed. Whether Shelley is the speaker and, if so, whether they were broadcast as allegedly by Churchill is unproven according to one source. One report states Shelley did record a performance of Churchill's \\"We shall fight on the beaches\\" speech, which is claimed to be one of the three non-matching speeches,. However Shelley's 78rpm record is dated 7 September 1942, whereas Churchill's speech was broadcast on 4 June 1940, key parts being read out by a BBC announcer. Shelley claimed that he did once voice Churchill for an introduction to a wartime propaganda film for distribution overseas with Churchill's permission, as the Prime Minister could not find time for the necessary visit to the studio. According to Shelley's great friend, former BBC radio and TV producer and presenter, Trevor Hill, Shelley did indeed stand in for Churchill on at least three occasions, specifically when Churchill was ill or out of the country. This would never have been divulged at the time. Shelley's party piece, often requested apparently, was for everyone to close their eyes while he impersonated Churchill when, according to Hill, it was impossible to tell the difference. Churchill did re-record most of his speeches at Chartwell in 1949. The EMI Engineer responsible has told the BECTU History Project that he used one of the then new BTR tape recorders and that Churchill usually did this in bed, so they have a more relaxed air than the original broadcast. These are often what are heard when played today.

Between Chernyshevskoye and Lithuanian Kybartai is an important 24-hour border crossing point on the A229 principal road (part of the European route E28) and the railway route connecting Kaliningrad with Moscow through Lithuania and Belarus. History The settlement was first mentioned in the 16th century, when the area was part of the Polish Duchy of Prussia, near where its eastern border ran as stipulated by the 1422 Treaty of Melno. Eydtkuhnen church, about 1909 Incorporated into the Prussian province of East Prussia, Eydtkuhnen became the eastern terminus and border station of the Prussian Eastern Railway in 1860, connecting Berlin with the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìWarsaw Railway in the Russian Empire. To continue their voyage, passengers‚Äîe.g., of the Nord Express luxury train coming from Saint Petersburg‚Äîhad to change over from Russian broad gauge to standard gauge railcars to Berlin and Paris, leaving on the other side of the platform. The same interchange in the opposite direction was provided at the Russian train station in neighboring Virbalis (Wirballen). The Eydtkuhnen station building, erected according to plans by Friedrich August St√ºler, offered luxuriously furnished waiting rooms and restaurants. The railway connection decisively promoted Eydtkuhnen's development: the Neo-Romanesque Lutheran parish church was built according to plans by Friedrich Adler and consecrated in 1889; the settlement received town privileges in 1922, when the population reached 10,000. Nevertheless, Eydtkuhnen was devastated during the Russian invasion of East Prussia in 1914 and again in 1945 during the East Prussian Offensive of the Red Army. After World War I and the Act of Independence, the border crossing led to Lithuania, while corridor trains provided the railway connection to Berlin. With the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line after World War II, the area became part of the Soviet Union, while the remaining German population was expelled. Up to today, large parts of Chernyshevskoye are a military restricted area.

He was the Liberal MP for the federal riding of York South‚ÄîWeston in Toronto from 2000 to 2011, and was the final Metro Toronto Chairman before the amalgamation of Metro Toronto into the new City of Toronto. Background Tonks is the son of the late Chris Alexander Tonks (1917-2006), who was a reeve (1957-1960), deputy reeve, Board of Control member and alderman in what was first the Township and then the Borough of York (1969-1988) in Metropolitan Toronto.https://ogs.on.ca/ogspi_pages/2006/o2006ton.htm#tonks After graduating from York Memorial Collegiate Institute Tonk's father ran Tonks Hardware and Electric at 452 Rogers Road founded by his grandfather.http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/beyond-politics/episodes/15658388# Alan Tonks attended York University, where he earned a master's degree in political economy, and the University of Toronto, where he received a master's degree in education. He spent time working for a Canadian aid agency in Jamaica before becoming a junior high teacher for the Scarborough Board of Education for several years. Married to Cecile, Tonks has three adult children, Chris, Matthew, and Alison. His son Chris is now a trustee on the Toronto District School Board. Local/municipal politics Tonks entered municipal politics in 1978 and served as a member of the Board of Control in York from 1978 to 1980. He lost his first bid for they mayoralty in 1980 before serving as mayor from 1982 to 1988. Due to a change in the Act governing Metropolitan Toronto, the position of Metro Chairman, beginning in 1988, had to be elected from Metro Councillors who were themselves elected to represent specific wards. Mayors continued to sit on Metro Council on an ex- officio basis but were now ineligible to be candidates for Metro Chairman as were former or non-members of Metro Council. Accordingly, incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn, a former mayor of Etobicoke, had to run for Metro Councillor in a specific ward if he wanted to remain Metro Chairman. Similarly, Tonks, who wished to become Metro Chairman, could not run for that position while being Mayor of York. Accordingly, in the 1988 municipal election, he did not run for re-election as Mayor of York and instead ran for the position of Metro Councillor representing one of York's two Metro wards. At the first Metro Council session following the municipal election, Tonks was elected Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto by the other members of Metro Toronto Council defeating incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn, the only time a sitting Metro Chairman would be defeated by a challenger. Tonks served as Metro Chairman until 1997 when the municipality was amalgamated by the provincial government of Mike Harris resulting in the abolition of Metro Council and the replacement of the Metro Chairman by a new Mayor of Toronto directly elected by all voters. Tonks was a supporter of the city's amalgamation, and led the Transition Team responsible for administering the new City of Toronto. He did not run in the 1997 \\"Megacity\\" election for the position of mayor and retired from elected municipal politics. In 1999, he was appointed chair of the Greater Toronto Services Board and served until 2000 when he became a federal member of parliament. Provincial politics He first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1975 provincial election as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party, and finished third in York South against former New Democratic Party leader Donald C. MacDonald. He was also unsuccessful in the 1987 Ontario election, losing to NDP leader Bob Rae by only 333 votes in York South. Federal politics He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2000 election as the Liberal MP for York South‚ÄîWeston defeating Independent MP (and former Liberal) John Nunziata by 1,497 votes. In 2003 he served as a parliamentary secretary to the Minister for the Environment. He was re-elected by a much greater margin in the federal elections held in 2004. He served as a member of the official opposition from 2006 to 2011, when he lost his seat by around 2500 votes to the NDP's Mike Sullivan.

It has been the home ground of Scottish Premiership club Livingston since 1995, and has an all-seater capacity of 9,512. History The stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Edinburgh football club Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council. It is hired by Livingston from West Lothian Council every year. Livingston initially rapidly moved up the divisions of Scottish football, and the stadium was expanded to meet Scottish Premier League (SPL) standards in time for the club's promotion to the top flight in 2001. The record attendance for a Livingston match at Almondvale is 10,112 and was set during that first season in the SPL, for a match against Rangers on 27 October 2001. Almondvale pictured in 2007 during an international friendly The stadium has changed names several times due to sponsorship deals. However, supporters of the club continue to call the stadium Almondvale or the 'Vale. It was previously officially titled the City Stadium in the early 2000s due to a sponsorship deal with the City group. It had also been called the West Lothian Courier Stadium before that. However, after the club were taken over by the Lionheart Consortium in 2005, it reverted to its original name, Almondvale Stadium. It was renamed 'Braidwood Motor Company Stadium' in a three-year naming rights deal in May 2010. In June 2013, it was renamed again for sponsorship reasons to 'Energy Assets Arena'. In September 2015, it was renamed again for sponsorship reasons to its current name of 'Tony Macaroni Arena'. On 7 April 2011, there were rumours that the stadium could be sold off to a supermarket development, and in turn finance a new stadium, of slightly smaller design, a mile away. However, nothing became of these rumours. Structure and facilities Almondvale is a 9,521 capacity all-seater ground. It has four stands which are all roughly of the same height and two corners of the ground are filled with covered seating. There is an open corner on one side of the West Stand and there is also the 5 storey stadium house in the other corner of the ground which is primarily used for conferences and offices. All the stands are one tier high and the stadium has four large floodlights situated at each corner of the ground. The stadium is covered and shielded from the weather elements by the roof and the windshields at the side of the stands. Almondvale also has a red blaze pitch and fully operational under-soil heating. Other uses In 2008, Gretna played one match in the stadium, a 3‚Äì0 loss against Celtic, when their temporary home (Fir Park) had problems with its pitch. In 2013, Albion Rovers played their cup tie against Rangers at Almondvale in front of a crowd of 5,345. Over the years it has also been chosen to host Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17 and women's matches. The stadium has hosted the 2012 and the 2013 Challenge Cup finals. On 27 May 2012, the stadium hosted the 2012 Scottish Junior Cup Final. Hibernian Reserves also used the Stadium. Location and transport Aerial view of Almondvale The town of Livingston is situated in the central belt of Scotland, approximately 18 miles west of Edinburgh and 33 miles east of Glasgow, and easily accessible from the M8 motorway. The stadium is located at the centre of the town, in the Almondvale district, near the shopping centre and situated by the River Almond. The ground is signposted reasonably well around the town for the convenience of road traffic. Parking spaces are abundantly found in close proximity to the stadium, either near the shopping centre or at the stadium. There are two railway stations in reach of the ground; Livingston North and Livingston South. The North station is served by trains from Edinburgh and Glasgow and is about a 30-minute walk away from the ground. The South station also receives trains from both Edinburgh and Glasgow and is about a 40-minute walk away from the stadium. In addition to the train stations, the central bus terminal at Livingston is located on Almondvale Avenue, 5 minutes walk from the ground.

In mathematical graph theory, the Higman‚ÄìSims graph is a 22-regular undirected graph with 100 vertices and 1100 edges. It is the unique strongly regular graph srg(100,22,0,6), i.e. no neighboring pair of vertices share a common neighbor and each non-neighboring pair of vertices share six common neighbors. It was first constructed by and rediscovered in 1968 by Donald G. Higman and Charles C. Sims as a way to define the Higman‚ÄìSims group, and that group is a subgroup of index two in the group of automorphisms of the Higman‚ÄìSims graph.. Construction From M22 graph Take the M22 graph, a strongly regular graph srg(77,16,0,4) and augment it with 22 new vertices corresponding to the points of S(3,6,22), each block being connected to its points, and one additional vertex C connected to the 22 points. From Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph There are 100 independent sets of size 15 in the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. Create a new graph with 100 corresponding vertices, and connect vertices whose corresponding independent sets have exactly 0 or 8 elements in common. The resulting Higman‚ÄìSims graph can be partitioned into two copies of the Hoffman-Singleton graph in 352 ways. From a cube Take a cube with vertices labeled 000, 001, 010, ..., 111. Take all 70 possible 4-sets of vertices, and retain only the ones whose XOR evaluates to 000; there are 14 such 4-sets, corresponding to the 6 faces + 6 diagonal-rectangles + 2 parity tetrahedra. This is a 3-(8,4,1) block design on 8 points, with 14 blocks of block size 4, each point appearing in 7 blocks, each pair of points appearing 3 times, each triplet of points occurring exactly once. Permute the original 8 vertices any of 8! = 40320 ways, and discard duplicates. There are then 30 different ways to relabel the vertices (i.e., 30 different designs that are all isomorphic to each other by permutation of the points). This is because there are 1344 automorphisms, and 40320/1344 = 30. Create a vertex for each of the 30 designs, and for each row of every design (there are 70 such rows in total, each row being a 4-set of 8 and appearing in 6 designs). Connect each design to its 14 rows. Connect disjoint designs to each other (each design is disjoint with 8 others). Connect rows to each other if they have exactly one element in common (there are 4x4 = 16 such neighbors). The resulting graph is the Higman‚ÄìSims graph. Rows are connected to 16 other rows and to 6 designs  degree 22. Designs are connected to 14 rows and 8 disjoint designs  degree 22. Thus all 100 vertices have degree 22 each. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Higman‚ÄìSims graph is a group of order isomorphic to the semidirect product of the Higman‚ÄìSims group of order with the cyclic group of order 2. It has automorphisms that take any edge to any other edge, making the Higman‚ÄìSims graph an edge-transitive graph.Brouwer, A. E. and Haemers, W. H. \\"The Gewirtz Graph: An Exercise in the Theory of Graph Spectra.\\" Euro. J. Combin. 14, 397-407, 1993. The characteristic polynomial of the Higman‚ÄìSims graph is (x ‚àí 22)(x ‚àí 2)77(x + 8)22. Therefore the Higman‚ÄìSims graph is an integral graph: its spectrum consists entirely of integers. It is also the only graph with this characteristic polynomial, making it a graph determined by its spectrum. Inside the Leech lattice 220px|right|thumbA projection of the Higman‚ÄìSims graph inside the Leech lattice. The Higman‚ÄìSims graph naturally occurs inside the Leech lattice: if X, Y and Z are three points in the Leech lattice such that the distances XY, XZ and YZ are 2, \\\\sqrt{6}, \\\\sqrt{6} respectively, then there are exactly 100 Leech lattice points T such that all the distances XT, YT and ZT are equal to 2, and if we connect two such points T and T‚Ä≤ when the distance between them is \\\\sqrt{6} , the resulting graph is isomorphic to the Higman‚ÄìSims graph. Furthermore, the set of all automorphisms of the Leech lattice (that is, Euclidean congruences fixing it) which fix each of X, Y and Z is the Higman‚ÄìSims group (if we allow exchanging X and Y, the order 2 extension of all graph automorphisms is obtained). This shows that the Higman‚ÄìSims group occurs inside the Conway groups Co2 (with its order 2 extension) and Co3, and consequently also Co1. chapter 10 (John H.

The two species are the southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree) and the northern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi). They are unique among frogs in that they produce their own poison rather than obtain it from their food source as is the case in every other poisonous frog species. Description The northern form of the corroboree frog deviates slightly in having narrow yellow to greenish stripes and is slightly smaller. Distribution Corroboree frogs have different patterns. The corroboree frog is found only in 400 km2 patches in the sub-alpine regions of the Australian Capital Territory and southern New South Wales. Biology Reproduction Sexual maturity of P. corroboree is reached at four years of age, with one year as an embryo/tadpole and two years as a juvenile/subadult. Adults primarily have only one breeding season. Breeding occurs around December terrestrially near shallow pools, fens, seepages, wet grassland or wet heaths, where the males build chamber nests within the grasses and moss. Males compete for females via song. Each male will attract up to ten females to his burrow sequentially and may dig a new burrow if his first is filled with eggs. The female lays up to 38 eggs and the male grasps her and deposits sperm directly onto the eggs. Tadpoles develop but remain within the protective egg coat until hatching occurs when high ground-water levels after rain cause the nest to become flooded at 4 to 6 months. Tadpole development takes six to eight months. Metamorphosis occurs between December and February. P. pengilleyi prefers to breed in sphagnum bogs and wet heath in sub-alpine areas and dense patches of herbs in openings or seepages amongst fallen tussocks at lower elevation (bog pools at high altitudes above 1300 m and in shallow seepage pools in gullies at lower altitudes of 1000‚Äì1400 m). Other reproductive details are as for P. corroboree. Both species are restricted to mountain and sub-alpine woodlands, heathlands and grasslands. Non-breeding habitat for both species occurs in forest, woodland and heath adjacent to breeding sites. Diet The typical diet of a mature corroboree frog includes beetles, mites, ants and insect larvae. However, as tadpoles they also tend to eat algae and other small pieces of organic material found in their pools. Toxicity Corroboree frogs are the first vertebrates discovered that are able to produce their own poisonous alkaloid, as opposed to obtaining it via diet as many other frogs do. The alkaloid is secreted from the skin as a defence against predation, and potentially against skin infections by microbes. It has been described as potentially lethal to mammals if ingested. The unique alkaloid produced has been named pseudo-phrynamine. Behaviour Corroborree frogs are quite unusual in their nature. Not only do they not start breeding until four years of age, they also hibernate during winter under whatever shelter they can find. This may be snow gum trees, or bits of bark or fallen leaves. Males stay with the egg nests and may breed with many females over the course of one season. Conservation status Southern corroboree frog in a breeding facility at Taronga Zoo Sydney. The southern corroboree is recognised as being critically endangered with fewer than 200 individuals left in the wild in recent years. The northern species is listed as endangered. Current status The southern corroboree frog was considered relatively numerous within its very small distribution in the 1970s, as of June 2004 it had an estimated adult population of 64. This species has suffered declines of up to 80% over the past 10 years. It is found only within a fragmented region of less than 10 km¬≤ within Mount Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales. It is only found at 1300 m above sea level. As of 2004 it is listed as critically endangered and is considered to be one of Australia's most endangered species. The northern corroboree frog has not suffered as badly as the southern. It is more widely distributed across about 550 km¬≤ of the Brindabella and Fiery Ranges in Namadgi National Park, Australian Capital Territory, and Kosciuszko National Park and Buccleuch State Forest in New South Wales. It is found above about 1000m and is found to have higher population numbers at lower elevations. In 2004 it was downgraded from an IUCN assessment of critical to endangered . Cause for decline The near-loss of these frogs has been attributed to a variety of causes, such as habitat destruction from recreational 4WD use; development of ski resorts; feral animals; degradation of the frogs' habitat; the extended drought cycle affecting much of southeastern Australia at present; and increased UV radiation flowing from ozone layer depletion. The drought affects these frogs by drying out their breeding sites so that the breeding cycle, which is triggered by seasonal changes and may require moistening of the bogs in autumn and spring to bring on specific developmental events, is delayed. This may mean that tadpoles have not metamorphosed by late summer when their bogs dry out, and so perish. The bogs themselves are apparently drier than usual. Severe bushfires in the Victorian and NSW high country in January 2003 destroyed much of the frogs' remaining habitat, especially the breeding sites and the leaf litter that insulates overwintering adults. The fire affected almost all southern corroboree frog habitat, however recent surveys have shown that the fire resulted in a lower than expected decline in population. As with many other Australian frogs, the predominant reason for the corroboree frogs' decline is thought to be infection with the chytrid fungus. This fungus is believed to have been accidentally introduced to Australia in the 1970s and destroys the frogs' skin, usually fatally. Corroboree frogs' eggs appear to be immune. Frog populations may eventually be able to acquire immunity, as wild relatively healthy adults have been found with the fungus on their skin. Conservation efforts The Amphibian Research Centre had already begun a rescue programme under which eggs were collected and raised to late tadpole stage before return as close as possible to their collection site. Research is now underway into captive breeding and on which lifecycle stage ‚Äì eggs, tadpoles or adults ‚Äì promises the best chance of survival following return to the wild. The national parks authorities in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria have developed conservation programmes, including a captive husbandry programme at Tidbinbilla, ACT, Taronga Zoo in Sydney, as well as Zoos Victoria at Healesville Sanctuary.

Les Eyzies-de-Tayac was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. Geography Location The town centre The commune is located at the confluence of the V√©z√®re and the Beune rivers. It is accessible by the SNCF network at the Gare des Eyzies, by the A89 motorway, exit 16 P√©rigueux-East (Bordeaux ‚Äì P√©rigueux axis) and then by the D710 road or by Montignac via Terrasson (Lyon - Terrasson-Lavilledieu axis). In the north-west, the commune is also watered by another small tributary of the V√©z√®re, the Manaurie. Climate In the Dordogne department, the highest temperature was recorded on 4 and 5 August 2003 at Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, with 43¬∞C. Neighbouring communes and villages Population Toponymy In Occitan, the commune bears the name Las Aisi√°s de Taiac e Siru√®lh. History In March 1868, the geologist Louis Lartet, financed by Henry Christy, discovered the first five skeletons of Cro-Magnons, the earliest known examples of Homo sapiens sapiens, in the Cro-Magnon rock shelter at Les Eyzies-de-Tayac. These skeletons included a foetus, and the skulls found were remarkably modern-looking and much rounder than the earlier Neanderthal. Economy As at 31 December 2013, the municipality has 209 establishments, including 151 in the field of commerce, transport or services, twenty relating to the administrative sector, education, health or social action, eighteen in construction, thirteen in the industry, and seven in agriculture, forestry or fishing.

Natural Sites * Grotte du Grand Roc, cave with natural eccentric crystallisations comparable to corals. Prehistoric sites The municipality has many prehistoric archaeological sites including: * The Grotte de Font-de-Gaume, the last cave with prehistoric polychrome paintings still open to visit in the region * Les Combarelles - 600 pre-historic engravings of animals and symbols * Grotte de la Mouthe - ornate cave of the Upper Paleolithic period * La Grotte de Bernifal * The deposit of La Micoque - discovery of numerous testimonies of the lithic industries of the Paleolithic (Tayacian, Micoquien and Mousterian) * Abri Chadourne, named after its owner * L'abri Audi* L'abri de Cro-Magnon, the eponymous site of the Cro-Magnon man. * L'abri Pataud, a site studied under the responsibility of the National Museum of Natural History.

The discovery of these shelters within a restricted radius around Les Eyzies, their methodical exploration and the study of the deposits they concealed allowed prehistory to build up as a science and explains why the city claims the status of world capital of the prehistory, as the publicity leaflets recall.

Elected as a Liberal, he ended his career in 2005 as the independent Member of Parliament (MP) for London‚ÄîFanshawe. O'Brien graduated with an honours Bachelor of Arts in history from the University of Western Ontario in 1971, and earned his Master of Education from UWO in 1981. He has served as a high school history teacher and was a member of London City Council from 1982 to 1993. He was also a school trustee from 1980 to 1982. He was elected to Parliament as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in the 1997, 2000, and 2004 elections. From 2000 to 2003, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade. Before leaving the party, O'Brien was often considered as representing the right-wing of the Liberal party. He was one of the fiercest opponents of same-sex marriage in the Liberal caucus, along with Tom Wappel. He has frequently chastised Prime Minister Paul Martin for not allowing a free vote among his Cabinet on Bill C-38, which is the act to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada. He has repeatedly called for the notwithstanding clause to be used to override the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which courts have repeatedly ruled requires the government to recognize same-sex marriages. He is also strongly against abortion. On June 6, 2005, O'Brien left the Liberal Party to sit as an independent, citing his opposition to same-sex marriage, and his discomfort with the revelations coming out of the Gomery Commission on the sponsorship scandal. On June 14, O'Brien issued an ultimatum to the government, indicating that he and an anonymous Liberal MP would vote against the government in a series of confidence votes that evening unless the same-sex marriage bill is delayed until the fall session of Parliament. However, the Liberals went on to survive the confidence votes and eventually got the same-sex marriage bill passed in the summer session of parliament. In the fall of 2005, O'Brien announced that he and a former Conservative MP were founding an advocacy group to try to reverse the legalization of same-sex marriage. O'Brien has stated that up to 90% of his constituents were opposed to same-sex marriage, and in the 2004 election, he defeated New Democrat candidate Irene Mathyssen by over 3,000 votes, a supporter of same sex marriage. In the 2006 election, although he did not run, he endorsed a Conservative who opposed same-sex marriage; but this time, Mathyssen won the riding. Since leaving Parliament, he has remained active in conservative Canadian politics, appearing at the REAL Women of Canada convention in 2010.

History The party was founded in 1969 by students from Victoria University of Wellington, and was originally named the Socialist Action League. The new party rejected the more established groups such as the Communist Party as too authoritarian, conservative, and unimaginative, but at the same time, rejected many of the newer communist groups in New Zealand as disorganised and unfocused. It was aligned with the Fourth International (FI), an international grouping of Trotskyist parties. The party achieved a certain amount of public recognition for its role in protests against the Vietnam War, and regularly engaged in protests against adventurist United States foreign policy, in defence of the pro-choice side of the abortion debate, as well as supporting LGBT rights in New Zealand, during the 1970s and 1980s. During those decades, the SAL maintained a newspaper of its own, Socialist Action. According to the National Library of New Zealand serials catalogue, it ran from 1969 to 1988. In the 1980s, the Socialist Workers Party in the United States broke away from Trotskyism, and left the FI. A number of other parties in FI also chose to leave, including the Socialist Action League in New Zealand. Those members of the Socialist Action League who did not agree with this departure from Trotskyism and the FI were expelled or resigned. Later, the Socialist Action League renamed itself the Communist League, following the pattern of the other pro-SWP parties that had left the FI. Today, the party is still associated with the Socialist Workers Party's so-called Pathfinder tendency. The League holds frequent public meetings called Militant Labour Forums. The Militant newspaper and books published by Pathfinder Press are distributed from the Pathfinder Bookshop in the Auckland suburb of Onehunga. In the 2002 elections, it stood two candidates, and gained their best result in 12 years with 171 votes. In the 2005 elections it also ran two candidates, but received only 107 votes. The party stood two candidates in the 2008 election, who gained 58 and 16 votes. The party also stood two candidates in the 2010 Auckland City Council elections. The party stood Annalucia Vermunt as its candidate for Mayor of Auckland at the 2013 local body elections. Vermunt received 856 votes. The party stood Baskaran Appu as its candidate for City Councillor in the Manukau Ward. Appu received 1,154 votes. The party stood two candidates in the 2014 election. The League's two candidates were Felicity Coggan, who received 92 votes in the electorate of Maungakiekie, and Annalucia Vermunt, who received 43 votes in the electorate of Manukau East. These figures represented 0.28% and 0.17% respectively of the total valid vote in those seats. The 92 votes received by Coggan was the best result for the League in a General Election since 2002. The League ran Patrick Brown as their candidate for the 2017 Mount Albert by-election. Brown received 16 votes. Brown's press release stated \\"...my campaign presents a working class programme and revolutionary course to overthrow capitalist rule.\\" It subsequently stood two candidates in the 2017 election, winning 109 votes. It is standing candidates in the 2020 general election. Electoral results (1990‚Äì2020) {class=wikitable !

Born in 1945, Wood grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, receiving a BA in English (in 1967) from then Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University). He received an MA (in 1971) and a PhD (in 1973) in geography from Clark University, in Worcester, Massachusetts. Wood taught environmental psychology, landscape history, and design in then School of Design (now College of Design) at North Carolina State University from 1974 through 1996, living and raising his family in Boylan Heights. Beginning in 1996, Wood spent over two years in prison on a conviction for molesting a teenage boy. Academic career His book The Power of Maps (1992) was considered radical when it was published. The Power of Maps has been a linchpin of the ‚Äúnew cartographies‚Äù in which maps are redefined as socially constructed arguments based upon consistent semiotic codes. Wood's consistent critique ‚Äúof the ideals of modern academic cartographers and of modern cartographic ideology‚Äù has been wide-ranging, informed, and decisive. In 2004, John Pickles, Early N. Phillips Distinguished professor at the University of North Carolina summed up Wood's contributions this way: ‚ÄúFor over twenty-five years, Denis Wood has been provoking us to think differently and critically about maps and map use.‚ÄùJohn Pickles, A History of Spaces: Cartographic reason, mapping and the geo-coded world, Routledge, NY, 2004, pp. 60-71. The book was first issued in 1992 as a catalogue accompanying a major exhibition called The Power of Maps at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design in New York. That show was later remounted at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in 1994. These exhibitions were the graphic genesis of the 1992 book which has been the subject of both scholarly commentary and popular interest. As opposed to those who insist maps ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù reality the critical cartographers, led by Wood, have insisted maps represent nothing. Instead, they present an argument about the world through the careful choice of content arranged graphically at a specific scale. This thesis, and the mechanisms of its activation, is at the heart of Wood and John Fels 2008 University of Chicago Press publication, The Natures of Maps. As one reviewer put it: ‚ÄúIn 1986 Wood and Fels took apart the map; describing ten codes through which its signs create meaning. Their argument was subsequently enfolded into Wood‚Äôs The Power of Maps ‚Ä¶Twenty-one years later, Wood and Fels have put the map back together again ‚Äòby replacing the whole idea of the map as a representation with that of the map as a system of propositions.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúThe map is not a picture,‚Äù Wood and Fels insist in this new book, ‚ÄúIt is an argument ‚Ä¶ everything about a map, from top to bottom, is an argument.‚Äù This idea of the map as an argument presented rather than a reality represented extends a more general thesis on the manner in which we ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù the world through a range of socially-conditioned perspectives, and do so at various scales. A relevant but quite distinct title in this area of work is Wood's 2004 volume, Five Billion Years of Global Change: A History of the Land. Cartographic art More recently, Wood has joined his expertise in cartography with his interest in art and art history. A collage artist and painter, he has created in recent years a bibliography and history of cartographic art; work that from the Dadaist to the present have used maps as a medium for the exposition of cultural and political ideas and ideals. Again, the general thesis is the same as in Wood's other work: images‚Äîwhether map, art, or artful maps‚Äîpresent a thesis through selection of subject matter self-consciously arranged through a medium's tools of exposition. Conviction In April 1996, Wood pleaded guilty to \\"crimes against nature\\" (viz. fellatio) and \\"taking indecent liberties with a minor\\", on more than one-hundred and thirty occasions.\\"NCSU Design Professor Admits Molestations of Teen Boy\\", News and Observer, Raleigh, NC, 21 April 1996, p. B-4. From 1996-1998, he spent 26 months in the North Carolina penal system as a result of his conviction. He is not on any national or regional register of sex offenders and has spoken publicly about his incarceration and the charges that led to it.\\"Ex-con Maps Out Better Life\\", News and Observer, Raleigh, NC, 21 August 1998, p. B-1. The urbanist writer and activist Jane Jacobs has wondered in press whether Wood's arrest and incarceration may be one reason why some of his work receives less attention than it deserves. Despite the conviction, his writing and work continued and since his release he has continued to live in Raleigh, NC, while lecturing and working internationally in his field. For example, in 2008 he presented a plenary at the Royal Geographical Society in London. In a 1998 interview with the News and Observer, Wood announced plans for a book based on his prison experience. It was described as planned for publication by the Johns Hopkins University Press. The book is currently scheduled for publication by The Center for American Places, distributed by University of Chicago Press. Wood offered a presentation with the same title at the 2003 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association.\\"Soft Time in a Hard Place\\", abstract of presentation at the annual meeting of the APHA, 18 November 2003 Publications Wood has published several scholarly articles and books.

The battalion was made up of 800 Georgians and 400 Germans, with mainly German officers. It was one of the last battles in the European theatre.BBC \\"Coast\\" programme, 19 October 2012 Overview The heavily fortified island was part of the German Atlantic Wall system of defence. However, after the Allied landings in Normandy it was relegated to relative insignificance. The men of the rebellious battalion were former Red Army soldiers from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic captured on the Eastern front. They had been given a choice: the captured soldiers could choose either to remain in the prisoner of war camps, which would have meant abuse, starvation, and very possibly death, or to serve in the German military and be allowed a degree of freedom. The battalion was formed of men who chose the latter option. Anti-communist emigres living in Western Europe also joined these units, see Georgian Legion (1941‚Äì45). The battalion had been formed at Kruszyna near Radom in occupied Poland in June 1943 and was used initially to fight partisans. On 24 August 1943 it was ordered to the West to relieve troops of the Indische Freiwilligen-Legion Regiment 950. The battalion arrived at Zandvoort in the Netherlands on 30 August. From September 1943 to early February 1945 it was stationed at Zandvoort as part of the \\"Unterabschnitt Zandvoort\\". On 6 February 1945 the battalion was posted to Subsection Texel. Preparations then started in late March 1945 for the transfer of several companies of the Georgian battalion to the Dutch mainland to oppose Allied advances, triggering the rebellion. Shalva Loladze, the leader of the Georgian uprising Shortly after midnight on the night of 5‚Äì6 April 1945, the Georgians rose up and gained control of nearly the entire island. Approximately two hundred German soldiers were killed in the initial uprising, in their quarters or while standing guard, walking the roads of the island in groups or individually that night and the following day. https://www.bclocalnews.com/news/the-battle-of-texel-island/ Members of the Dutch resistance participated and assisted the Georgians. However, the rebellion hinged on an expected Allied landing which did not occur. Furthermore, the Georgians failed to secure the naval batteries on the southern and northern coasts of the island; the crews of these artillery installations were the only Germans still alive on the island. A counterattack was ordered and the intact artillery batteries on the island began firing at sites where rebels were suspected to be. Approximately 2 000 riflemen of the 163rd Marine-Sch√ºtzenregimentComposed of surplus naval personnel and organized as an infantry formation; all such ad hoc organizations of the same genre towards the end of the war were poorly equipped, had little or no infantry training, and suffered from low morale were deployed from the Dutch mainland. Over the next five weeks they re-took the island; fighting was particularly heavy at Eierland and around the lighthouse. The German troops then combed the length of the island for any remaining Georgian soldiers, while the Dutch inhabitants sought to hide them. The German commander of the 882nd battalion, Major Klaus Breitner, stated long after the war that the uprising was \\"treachery, nothing else\\"; the captured mutineers were ordered to dig their own graves, remove their German uniforms, and be executed. During the rebellion, 565 Georgians, at least 812 Germans, and 120 residents of Texel were killed. The destruction was enormous; dozens of farms went up in flames, with damage later estimated at ten million guilders (US$3.77 million1945/46 exchange rate per Bretton Woods system peg). The bloodshed lasted beyond the German capitulation in the Netherlands and Denmark on 5 May 1945 and even beyond Germany's general surrender on 8 May 1945. The fighting continued until Canadian troops arrived 20 May 1945 to enforce the German surrender, and disarmed the remaining German troops. Aftermath Two wounded Georgian soldiers at Texel in 1945 The Georgians lie buried in a ceremonial cemetery at the Hogeberg near Oudeschild. The survivors may have feared facing the same fate as most Soviet collaborators: forced repatriation, under the terms of the Yalta Conference, often followed by incarceration and banishment and, for officers, execution. The 228 Georgians who survived by hiding from the German troops in coastal minefields, or who were concealed by Texel farmers, were turned over to Soviet authorities. After arrival at a collection camp in the Soviet Union, 26 Georgians were singled out and banished together with their families and others were sent to Gulag. Those still alive in the mid-1950s were rehabilitated and allowed to return home. Until 1991, the ambassador of the Soviet Union to the Netherlands visited the graves of the Georgians on 4 May every year, and, at least during the latter visits, called the Georgians \\"Heroes of the Soviet Union\\". The Soviet Union donated a number of memorials to the war dead on Texel, including a pillar in the island's main cemetery as well as various sculptures in the Georgian cemetery. Over time, the number of local participants in the memorial events declined as the Dutch Communist Party, which had played a key role in keeping the memory of the Georgian rebellion alive, dwindled in size and eventually disappeared. In the late 1960s, the Soviet memorialisation of the Texel rebels culminated in the release of a feature film known as 'Crucified Island'. It depicted the rebels as being prisoners of war who somehow managed to steal weapons from the Germans.See pp. 164-171 in Lee, Night of the Bayonets. On 4 May 2005, Mikheil Saakashvili visited the graves for the first time as the president of independent Georgia. His visit was officially described as a private one, and he was accompanied by his Dutch-born wife. The German dead were initially buried in a part of the general cemetery in Den Burg. In 1949 they found their final resting place at Ysselsteyn German war cemetery, Limburg province, the Netherlands. The cemetery is administered by the German War Graves Commission. Den Burg General Cemetery also contains a plot of 167 World War II Commonwealth burials, most of them airmen; 44 of the burials are unidentified. A permanent exhibition dedicated to these events can be found \\"in a corner\\" of the Aeronautical Museum at Texel International Airport. One of the last Georgian survivors of the uprising died in July 2007 and was buried with military honors in Zugdidi, Georgia. There were two Georgian survivors still alive in 2010: Grisha Baindurashvili, who was then 88 years old and lived in Kaspi, a village 40 km west of Tbilisi, and Eugeny Artemidze, who had been one of the main organizers of the rebellion; he died at age 90 on June 22, 2010, on the same day he had gone to war 69 years earlier. Baindurashvili appeared to have still been alive in 2015, when an interview with him was published.https://www.georgianjournal.ge/society/30462-the-story-of-texel- uprising-as-told-by-its-only-surviving-participant.html \\"The story of Texel uprising as told by its only surviving participant\\", Lala Papaskiri, Georgian Journal, May 15, 2015 Number of casualties Canadian troops led by Lt. Col. Kirk landed unopposed on Texel on 17 May 1945, effectively liberating the island. Over a two-day period the Canadians disarmed 1,535 Germans. Soviet SMERSH forces arrived on Texel and took charge of 228 Georgians still alive. A Canadian report prepared for the commander of the SMERSH contingent numbered 470 Georgian and 2,347 German casualties on Texel. In 1949, the German War Graves Commission disinterred on Texel 812 bodies (including the 400+ killed in their sleep by the Georgians in their shared quarters) for reburial at Ysselsteyn German war cemetery.The German War Graves Commission called the event Umbettung, roughly \\"exhumation and reburial\\" The numbers given by the Texel district list \\"565 Georgians, 120 Texel islanders and approximately 800 Germans killed\\"; followed by \\"other sources ... speak of more than 2,000 Germans killed.\\" The \\"other sources\\" comment in all probability refers to the Canadian report to SMERSH that lumped together under \\"casualties\\" the 1,535 disarmed Germans with their 812 dead.

The theory was one of the cornerstones of Stalinism in the internal politics of the Soviet Union. Although the term class struggle was introduced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and the aggravation of the class struggle was an expression originally coined by Vladimir Lenin in 1919 to refer to the dictatorship of the proletariat,Thesis and Report on Bourgeois Democracy and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat (4 March 1919). \\"Address to the Comintern\\". \\"The main thing that Socialists fail to understand‚Äîwhich constitutes their shortsightedness in matters of theory, their subservience to bourgeois prejudices, and their political betrayal of the proletariat‚Äîis that in capitalist society, whenever there is any serious aggravation of the class struggle intrinsic to that society, there can be no alternative but the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or the dictatorship of the proletariat\\". the theory itself was put forward by Joseph Stalin in 1929 and supplied a theoretical base for the claim that ongoing repression of capitalist elements is necessary. Stalin believed that residual bourgeois elements would persist within the country and that with support from Western powers they would try to infiltrate the party. A variation of the theory was also adopted by Mao Zedong in China.  Exposition and origin  Vladimir Lenin believed that the Russian Civil War represented the peak of the aggravation of class struggle which found its representation in the Soviet dictatorship of the proletariat and that by war's end and the victorious establishment of a workers' state in Russia the bourgeois class was effectively rooted out and therefore the theory no longer applied in that country. On the other hand, Joseph Stalin argued that the further the country moved forward in constructing socialism, the more acute the forms of struggle that would be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last desperate efforts. Therefore political repression was necessary to prevent them from succeeding in their presumed goal of destroying the Soviet Union. Stalin put forth this theory in 1929 in the special section of his speech \\"The Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)\\" at the plenum of the Central Committee and Central Control Commission, C.P.S.U.(B.) held 16‚Äì23 April 1929, which concluded:\\"The Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)\\". > The dying classes are resisting, not because they have become stronger than > we are, but because socialism is growing faster than they are, and they are > becoming weaker than we are. And precisely because they are becoming weaker, > they feel that their last days are approaching and are compelled to resist > with all the forces and all the means in their power. Such is the mechanics > of the intensification of the class struggle and of the resistance of the > capitalists at the present moment of history. Stalin believed that the class enemy could even worm its way into the Bolshevik Party claiming to lead a socialist state. He evaluated his associates of the day based on whether they acted on that belief or the belief that a party could have no enemies inside it. Tolerance inside the party to those who disagreed with the official party line was called \\"rotten liberalism\\" by Stalin.The expression rotten liberalism (Russian: –≥–Ω–∏–ª–æ–π –ª–∏–±–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–º, gniloy liberalizm) was introduced by Saltykov-Shchedrin in 1875 in the meaning of lack of principles, unscrupulousness. See \\"–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ–∫\\" (2007). Great Dictionary of Russian Proverbs. He believed such tolerance would make the party weak and eventually lead to its destruction. As a result, he argued that purges were sometimes necessary. The notion of the aggravation of class struggle under socialism stands in contrast to the ideas of other communists such as Nikolai Bukharin (against whom Stalin argued in the 1929 speech) or Leon Trotsky, who argued that there was no longer any bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union to have to struggle with and that the very definition of socialism implies there are no longer antagonistic classes in struggle.  Maoism  This theory is similar to Mao Zedong's slogan \\"Never forget class struggle!\\" once plastered all over the walls in China.\\"China's Struggle to Forget\\".\\"Mao Zedong and the Class Struggle in Socialist Society\\". Mao developed Stalin's idea further, saying that there is the possibility of an entire bourgeoisie developing inside the communist party leading a socialist state before the establishment of communism. Mao stressed the supposedly domestic roots of that bourgeoisie while Stalin focused more on presumed Western spies. According to Mao, the bourgeoisie inside the party aimed at the restoration of capitalism. Mao also held that peaceful evolution was the goal of the foreign capitalists and that the restoration of capitalism could happen from within without war, if there were an ebb in the class struggle. Upon coming to power, Deng Xiaoping rejected Mao's theory of the bourgeoisie in the party and as a result introduced the socialist market economy, justified by the theory of a primary stage of socialism.  Criticism  Martemyan Ryutin, a staunch opponent of Stalin, eventually repressed in 1937, argued in his manuscript \\"Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship\\", secretly circulated and known as the Ryutin Platform, that this theory is a merely declarative one, without any analysis in its support. In particular, Stalin's claim, in fact the only cornerstone of the theory, that not a single class defeated in a revolution known to cease its struggle, is ungrounded. Stalin gave not a single example of this and in fact the opposite was true in bourgeois revolutions. Ryutin concludes that this theory serves for the \\"justification of the civil war against the principal masses in the countryside\\".Martemyan Ryutin. Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship. 7. \\"–ö–ª–∞—Å—Å—ã –∏ –æ–±–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤–æ–π –±–æ—Ä—å–±—ã\\" (in Russian). Historian Timothy Snyder has argued that the theory served the Stalinist regime both as self-justification for the failures of its policies of collectivization (which were to be blamed on saboteurs rather than on the inadequacies of Soviet-type economic planning) and as an ideological tool for the continuation of mass repression: Similarly, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs criticized the theory in 1968 as non-Marxist and as a vehicle to serve Stalin's tactical maneuvers:  See also  * Cult of personality * Cultural Revolution * Maoism * Socialism in one country * Stalinism  References  Category:Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Category:Maoism Category:Marxism‚ÄìLeninism Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union Category:Political repression in China Category:Joseph Stalin Category:Soviet internal politics Category:Stalinism ","title":"Intensification of the class struggle under socialism"},{"id":"1110556","text":"Samlar machu () is the Khmer language term for a category of sour (machu) soups (samlar, also samlor, salaw, or salor) popularly known in English as simply \\"Cambodian sour soup\\".

Specifically, this books deals with the formation of various structures: *the universe *the Earth and its atmosphere, oceans, and continents *the origin of life *the evolution of humans *the development of agriculture *the rise and fall of civilizations *contemporary globalization A key theme is repeated through this book: humans have a tendency to divide our understandings into \\"history\\" and \\"prehistory\\". People are shocked when some event from prehistory intrudes upon their current lives; Wood likens the shock of this intrusion to an expulsion from the Garden of Eden. This division is a metaphor for various artificial divisions; for example: *the formation of the earth, the pre-biotic chemistry, and the origin of life *before the Industrial Revolution and our subsequent modern era Instead of thinking in terms of artificial divisions of \\"now\\" and \\"back then\\", readers should develop an intuitive mindset of graduated changes in which the \\"fossils\\" of the ancient past are intermingled with contemporary objects; for instance, the \\"oxygen holocaust\\" of the paleoproterozoic eon exists in today's oxygen-rich atmosphere. Also, the heroic saga induces another faulty thinking style that obscures the true nature of the world. To understand the real story of humanity, Wood argues that people must focus on the mass actions of people or of large impersonal forces rather than a few heroes or kings. Hollywood movies dealing with ecological threats are especially misleading; rather than imparting an accurate image of ecological issues, movies present a villain such as a mad scientist or a greedy, evil business person. Instead, such entertainment and much news reporting distracts us from our individual actions that are at the heart of ecological problems. Inaccurate ways of thinking induce a passive helplessness. Instead, by presenting a sweeping story of successive, interlinked, long term trends, the author hopes to give readers a flexible, authentic model of the world. With that model, readers will be capable of understanding (and possibly dealing with) current global challenges.

Chambers is the longest-serving state senator in Nebraska history. He is the only African-American to have run for governor and the first to have run for U.S. Senate in Nebraska history. Early life Chambers was born in the Near North Side neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska, to Malcolm Chambers, a local minister, and Lillian Chambers. His father's family originally came from Mississippi and his mother's family originally came from Louisiana. He has six siblings, who were all born in Omaha. In 1955, Chambers graduated from Omaha Tech High School. In 1959, he graduated from Creighton University with a B.A. in history, with minors in Spanish and philosophy. He attended Creighton University School of Law in the early 1960s and completed his degree in 1979. He refused to join the Nebraska State Bar Association, so was unable to practice law; in 2015, he explained his refusal on the grounds that he had earned the right to practice by passing law school, and should not have to pay the Bar Association dues as well.\\"Voices: Ernie Chambers\\", deathpenalty.org, July 10, 2015; retrieved January 11, 2017. Career Omaha Post Office In 1963, when Chambers was 25, he worked for the Omaha Post Office. He has said he was fired for insubordination because he spoke out against the management at the Post Office calling the black staff \\"boys\\". He picketed the Postmaster General's speech in Omaha with a sign that read, \\"I spoke against discrimination in the Omaha Post Office and was fired.\\" Summer 1966 riots During a series of heat waves in 1966, there were two disturbances in Omaha. In July, the Nebraska National Guard was summoned to restore order after police and black teenagers clashed three nights in a row. In early August, a series of riots occurred over three nights. Chambers worked as a spokesperson for the community during both conflicts, meeting with Mayor A.V. Sorenson and helping to end the riots. During this period, Chambers emerged as a prominent leader in the North Omaha community, where he successfully negotiated concessions from the city's leaders on behalf of North Omaha's African-American youth. Chambers headed a committee of the Near North Side Police-Community Relations Council, collated information, and presented numerous complaints about the police to city officials. The African-American community had previously been led by more established organizations like Omaha Urban League and the local chapter of the NAACP, not an emerging young anti- establishment leader like Chambers. Chambers was working as a barber at the time, and appeared in the Oscar-nominated 1966 documentary film A Time for Burning, where he talked about race relations in Omaha. Nebraska Legislature Chambers ran for a position on the Omaha School Board, but was not elected. He also failed as a write-in candidate for the City Council. In 1970, he was elected to represent North Omaha's 11th District, replacing George W. Althouse, who had been appointed to replace Senator Edward Danner, who had died in office. During the election, a policeman was killed in a deserted house by a bomb. Two Black Panthers, David Rice and Edward Poindexter, were charged in the death. Chambers protested, as he thought the men had been framed by COINTELPRO. First elected to represent North Omaha's 11th District in the Nebraska State Legislature in 1970, Chambers was reelected in every ensuing election through 2004. On April 25, 2005, Chambers became Nebraska's longest-serving state senator, having served for more than 35 years. He was not allowed to seek reelection in 2008 because of a constitutional amendment Nebraska voters passed in 2000 that limits Nebraska state legislators to two consecutive four-year terms. But the amendment permits senators to seek reelection to their office after sitting out for four years, and Chambers defeated incumbent Brenda Council in 2012 by a \\"landslide\\". Chambers also ran for the United States Senate in 1988 as a New Alliance Party candidate. He petitioned to be included on the 1974 ballot for governor of Nebraska and also ran for governor in 1994, receiving 0.44% of the vote. Marsh v. Chambers Chambers filed a lawsuit in 1980 attempting to end the Legislature's practice of beginning its session with a prayer offered by a state-supported chaplain, arguing that it was unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court held that the prayer did not violate the Constitution, but that state support for the chaplain did. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals held that both practices violated the Constitution. But in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), the Supreme Court held by a 6‚Äì3 vote that both practices were constitutional because of the United States' \\"unique history\\".  1986 NCAA student athletes as state employees  Chambers has promoted recognizing NCAA student athletes as state employees since the 1980s, arguing that they are generating revenue for their universities without any legal benefits for doing so, which encourages illegal payments and gifts. A bill on this issue was passed by the Legislature but was unable to overcome the governor's veto. After it was revealed that requiring student athletes to be recognized as state employees would jeopardize any university's NCAA standing, the language of the bill was changed so that a university could allow for players to be paid a stipend, after which the bill passed and was signed by the governor in 2003. 1989 Franklin scandal According to The New York Times, unidentified people present at a closed meeting reported that Chambers claimed he heard credible reports of \\"boys and girls, some of them from foster homes, who had been transported around the country by airplane to provide sexual favors, for which they were rewarded.\\" Investigating what became known as the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations, a Nebraska grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations and possibly return indictments. Eventually, the grand jury ruled the entire matter was \\"a carefully crafted hoax,\\" although they failed to identify the perpetrators of the hoax. 1993 LGBT anti- discrimination bill Nebraska's LGBT community has considered Chambers an ally since the 1970s. In 1993, he co-sponsored a bill to prohibit employment discrimination by sexual orientation. The bill faced fierce opposition. Opponents of the anti-discrimination legislation formed a Nebraska chapter of the Traditional Values Coalition and brought activist Lou Sheldon to Lincoln to organize antigay rallies outside the Capitol building. Despite the opposition, Chambers sponsored another LGBT anti-discrimination bill in 1995. He continued to support similar measures throughout his career in the legislature. None of them has been successful. 2006 Omaha Public Schools controversy In April 2006, Chambers introduced LB 1024, an amendment to a bill that would divide the Omaha Public Schools district into three different districts. The bill and its amendment were created in response to an effort by the district to \\"absorb a string of largely white schools that were within the Omaha city limits but were controlled by suburban or independent districts.\\" Omaha Schools claimed that the usurpation was necessary to avoid financial and racial inequity, but supporters of LB 1024 contested the district's expansion, favoring more localized control. The bill received national attention and some critics called it \\"state-sponsored segregation\\". A bill passed in 2007 repealed LB 1024, restoring pre-2006 Omaha-area school district boundaries, after which a \\"learning community\\" was created to equalize student achievement in Douglas and Sarpy counties. 2007 lawsuit against God Some members of the Nebraska legislature attempted to ban frivolous lawsuits from Nebraska's court system in 2007. Chambers believed that this attempt was misguided, and that access to the court system should not be restricted. To dramatize his point that the court system must be entirely open, Chambers filed a lawsuit against God in Douglas County district court in September 2007. It argued that God has caused \\"widespread death, destruction, and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants.\\" Nebraska media inaccurately reported that Chambers's lawsuit against God was intended as an ironic protest against frivolous lawsuits. Chambers clarified that, on the contrary, his lawsuit against God \\"emphasized that attempts by the Legislature to prohibit the filing of any lawsuit would run afoul of the Nebraska Constitution's guarantee that the doors to the courthouse must be open to everyone.\\" The Westboro Baptist Church filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit arguing that Chambers did not have standing to sue, and that he was \\"fully deserving of the outpourings of God's fierce wrath.\\" In response, Chambers voiced disagreement with the church but argued that the church's access to the court system must be protected, just like his. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2008 because a subpoena notifying God of the lawsuit could not be delivered to God, who has no listed address. Chambers countered that, because of God's omniscience, God had been notified, but decided not to pursue the suit further. Capital punishment Chambers is a firm opponent of the death penalty, and introduced a bill to repeal Nebraska's capital punishment law at the start of each legislative session, 36 times over 40 years. The bill, LB268, passed the legislature in 1979 but could not overcome Governor Charles Thone's veto; the issue remained a primary focus of his while in office. In 2015, Chambers introduced LB268, repealing the state's death penalty. The measure passed the legislature over Governor Pete Ricketts's veto. Following the veto, a petition drive was undertaken to reject the bill and maintain capital punishment. Enough signatures were secured to suspend LB268 until the November 2016 general election; in the election, 60% of the votes cast favored rejecting the repeal and keeping the death penalty.Duggan, Joe, Paul Hammel, and Martha Stoddard (May 28, 2015). \\"Hours of suspense, emotion lead up to a landmark vote for legislators on repealing death penalty\\", omaha.com; retrieved January 16, 2017.Hammel, Paul (October 16, 2015). \\"Death penalty supporters put repeal on hold till 2016 vote\\", Omaha World-Herald; retrieved January 16, 2017.Berman, Mark (November 9, 2016). \\"Nebraska and California voters decide to keep the death penalty\\", washingtonpost.com; retrieved January 16, 2017. Assorted legislation * Chambers has long advocated on behalf of David Rice and Ed Poindexter, who were convicted of the murder of an Omaha police officer; Amnesty International considers them political prisoners. * Often clashing with fellow senators, Chambers has taken on several issues of concern to rural Nebraskans during his tenure, such as a bill requiring landowners to manage the population of black- tailed prairie dogs on their property and a proposed constitutional amendment to preserve the right to fish, trap and hunt in the state. Chambers described the latter measure as one of the most \\"asinine, simple-minded pieces of trash\\" ever considered by the legislature. In 2004 Chambers co-authored an opinion piece with U.S. Representative Tom Osborne opposing a set of initiatives that would allow casino gambling and slot machines in Nebraska. Chambers also opposed proposed funding of the state's ethanol plant incentive programs, calling them \\"a boondoggle\\". * In 2006, Chambers withdrew support from two tax incentive bills that would have provided funding for Omaha and Lincoln civic building projects. He said he withdrew support because Omaha business leaders had insulted the legislature and the North Omaha community he represents by criticizing the passage of LB 1024. He was also insulted by the Omaha City Council's refusal to name a North Omaha park after him despite that neighborhood's request to do so. * In 2015, Chambers introduced LB473, opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. Outreach activities * On November 4, 2008, Chambers was elected to the new Douglas and Sarpy Counties' Learning Community Board; he was sworn in in 2009. * Chambers hosted a weekly call-in public-access television cable TV show on Omaha's Community Telecast, Inc. (CTI22), broadcast on Cox Channel 22. * In 2014, after ending his regular Omaha Star column, Chambers said he was going to write a blog. * Chambers distributes \\"Erniegrams\\" to other legislators that consist of typed poems and commentary about recent events and legislative topics in the current session, as well as photocopied articles and political cartoons of note, which are sometimes posted by other legislators on Twitter as Chambers does not use computers. Controversy \\"My ISIS is the police\\" On March 20, 2015, during a Judiciary Committee Hearing on Allowing Guns in Bars (LB 635), Chambers said, \\"My ISIS is the police.\\" He said his comments were intended to criticize the failure to prosecute Alvin Lugod, the Omaha police officer who fatally shot Danny Elrod on February 23. Although fellow senators did not react to his comments during the hearing, there was backlash. Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer responded, \\"The comments that Senator Ernie Chambers made today at the Nebraska Unicameral are not only reprehensible but are completely without merit.\\" Mayor Jean Stothert also criticized Chambers, saying in a press release that he should be looking for ways to improve public safety instead of \\"comparing police officers to terrorists.\\" Governor Pete Ricketts called Chambers's comments \\"irresponsible\\" and asked for an apology. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson were also critical, and the hashtag #supportblue was organized in response to Chambers's comments. Senator David Schnoor of Scribner called for his resignation. Senator Bob Krist of Omaha said he regretted that he had not immediately protested the remark. Several other senators disagreed with his opinion but defended his right to express it. Senator Dave Bloomfield of Hoskins remarked, \\"It's a wonderful opportunity to pile onto Senator Chambers.\\" Chambers said he would continue to be vocal in his criticism of the police and would not apologize. Residency challenge On November 8, 2016, Chambers was reelected to the legislature, defeating his opponent, John Sciara, by a vote of 7,763 to 1,726. In January 2017, Sciara filled a protest challenge to the legislature, claiming Chambers did not live in the district he was elected to represent and was thus ineligible to hold office. Chambers denied the allegation, calling it \\"busybody, gossipy, vengeful cud that already has been chewed.\\" On April 20, 2017, Nebraska state senators voted 42-0 to dismiss Sciara's challenge, following the recommendation of a special legislative committee formed to evaluate the claim. Term limit law In 2000, a term-limit amendment was passed that essentially forced Chambers‚Äîand half of Nebraska's state senators‚Äîout of office in 2008. The amendment required legislators sit out one term, after which they could run for election. In 2012, Chambers was once again elected to represent north Omaha's 11th district in the Nebraska Unicameral, defeating Brenda Council by a \\"landslide\\". He will be forced to sit out the 2020 election due to the same law.  Legacy  Chambers is a longtime civil rights activist and the most prominent and outspoken African-American leader in the state. He has been called \\"the Maverick of Omaha\\" and the \\"angriest black man in Nebraska,\\" and has called himself a \\"Defender of the Downtrodden.\\" In the 1990s, the apartment complex Strehlow Terrace was renamed Ernie Chambers Court. In 2008, a room at the Nebraska Capitol used for Judiciary Committee meetings was named the Ernie Chambers Memorial Hearing Room. Personal life Aside from a stint in the United States Army, Chambers has lived in Nebraska all his life. He is known for his casual attire of blue jeans and short- sleeved sweatshirts, even when in session at the Nebraska Legislature. He often brings his dog with him to work. Chambers is a sketch artist, a therapeutic activity he adopted during long legislative sessions. Chambers is an atheist, and introduced a bill to impose property taxes on churches (it did not pass). Despite not being religious, he obtained credentials in January 2009 as a non-denominational minister so he could officiate at weddings. Chambers was married to Jacklyn Adele (n√©e Lee) Chambers (January 31, 1940 ‚Äì July 15, 2000), with whom he had four children before they divorced.

It is located in the Kullu district, about north of the state capital, Shimla, 309 km (192 miles) north east of Chandigarh and 544 km (338 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. The small town, with a population of 8,096, is the beginning of an ancient trade route to Ladakh and from there over the Karakoram Pass on to Yarkand and Khotan in the Tarim Basin. It is a popular tourist destination and serves as the gateway to Lahaul and Spiti district as well as Leh.  History  Manali is named after the Sanatan Hindu lawgiver Manu. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of 'Manu-Alaya' which literally means 'the abode of Manu'.

The valley is often referred to as the 'Valley of the Gods'. Old Manali village has an ancient temple dedicated to sage Manu. The British introduced apple trees in the area. The first apple orchard was set up by the British near Patlikuhal, before this, no Apple trees grew in the area. To this day, apple-- along with plum and pear-- remain the best source of income for the majority of inhabitants. Both Rainbow and Brown Trout was also introduced into the rivers and streams of the area by the colonisers. With the increase in disposable incomes and somewhat owing to the rise of disturbances in Kashmir in the late 1980s, Manali witnessed a surge in tourist traffic. This once quiet village was transformed into a bustling town with numerous homestays as well as the occasional boutique hotel. During the warmer summer months, cafes and restaurants can be seen doing brisk business. Geography Himalayan mountains in Manali, Himachal Pradesh.

Mayo was the presenter of Simon Mayo Drivetime on BBC Radio 2 between January 2010 and May 2018 and is, with Mark Kermode, presenter of Kermode and Mayo's Film Review on BBC Radio 5 Live. Mayo was the presenter of a revamped drive time show on Radio 2 with co- host Jo Whiley which was broadcast from 14 May 2018 to 20 December 2018. Mayo presented the last show solo the following day, which marked the end of his career on the station after 17 years of broadcasting. In 2008, Mayo was recognised as the \\"Radio Broadcaster of the Year\\" at the 34th annual Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and the \\"Speech Broadcaster of the Year\\" at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, receiving the latter for his \\"ability to paint colourful pictures of location and event and his ability to bring the very best out of his guests, encouraging conversation and interaction between them while skilfully nudging and controlling them\\" and for being \\"a master of light and shade, handling serious and lighter issues with aplomb.\\" Mayo is the author of several books, including the acclaimed Itch trilogy of thrillers for younger readers. He is one of the highest paid BBC radio presenters. Early life Mayo's parents, Derek Mayo (born 1929, died 2001) and Jill Mayo, were both school teachers. He attended St John's Primary School in Croydon, Surrey, the Arden School in Knowle (for one term), Solihull School, an historic independent school in the West Midlands and Worthing High School in West Sussex which was then a state grammar school for boys. He graduated from the University of Warwick in 1980, with a degree in History and Politics. Early career His mother had undertaken part-time work in radio, and having occasionally experienced it with her, Mayo had wanted to work as a studio manager. But as a result of a frequency deficiency in his left ear, he failed the required hearing test, and refocused his career on presenting. Mayo spent some time honing his skills at Southlands Hospital Radio, and then worked for five years as a presenter with BBC Radio Nottingham from 10:45am to 2pm, followed by Dennis McCarthy. With a Radio Nottingham colleague he developed a programme format called Globe Phone and sent it to Johnny Beerling, Head of Radio 1, who offered him a job.Nottingham Evening Post, Saturday 3 June 2000 He joined BBC Radio 1 in 1986, presenting a two-hour Saturday evening show from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. In October 1987 he progressed to the weekend early slots from 6am to 8am and then became presenter of the weekday evening show in January 1988, which went out from 7:30pm to 10pm. Five months later he was offered the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show, regarded as the most prestigious presentation job in UK radio. The Radio 1 Breakfast Show Mayo spent five years presenting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 1. Throughout his tenure on the breakfast show, which was based on a \\"zoo\\" format, Mayo was joined by news anchor Rod McKenzie. Breakfast show newsreader stand-ins include Peter Bowes. The show went through a series of sidekick weather and travel presenters, including Carol Dooley, Sybil Ruscoe, Jackie Brambles, and Dianne Oxberry. Weather and travel news reader stand-ins include Mayo's Radio 1 colleague Lynn Parsons, Caron Keating (from Blue Peter and Songs of Praise), and Philippa Forrester (from CBBC). The show's producer was Ric Blaxill who also made regular speaking contributions. He started his first breakfast show by playing \\"Somewhere in My Heart\\" by Aztec Camera, which was preceded by a montage of previous breakfast show hosts and then Mayo himself saying 'It's me, Simon Mayo, good morning.' The programme became known for various features, including On This Day In History, soundtracked by a looped version of George Michael's \\"I Want Your Sex\\", and the long-running cryptic game The Identik-Hit Quiz, where Mayo and his co hosts would 'act' a short scene which cryptically led listeners to the title of a hit song. He also ran his Confessions feature where members of the public sought absolution for their (often frivolous or humorous) \\"sins\\", and it moved to a television series in later years. Mayo had already presented the dilemma show Scruples for BBC television, and had joined his BBC Radio 1 colleagues on the host roster for Top of the Pops. Both On This Day In History and Confessions spawned spin-off books. Due to frequent plays from Mayo, several unlikely hit singles reached the UK charts, including \\"Kinky Boots\\" by Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman; \\"Donald Where's Yer Troosers?\\" by Andy Stewart; and \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\", sung and written by Eric Idle. For helping Monty Python have a hit with the latter 13 years after it first appeared on the soundtrack to The Life of Brian, Idle presented Mayo with a model bare foot, in the style of the animated version which used to end the opening titles to the TV show. Like all of Radio 1's high-profile presenters of the time, Mayo would take his turn to spend a week in a coastal area of the UK during the Radio 1 Roadshows which occurred for three months of the summer. For a short while, he also presented an additional weekend show for the station on a Sunday afternoon and provisionally titled O Solomon Mayo ‚Äì to cover for the absent Phillip Schofield, who was working in the West End. Radio 1 mid-mornings Mayo officially gave up the breakfast show in 1993, though he had been on an extended period of paternity leave when the announcement was made. His stand- in Mark Goodier was his replacement. Mayo took over the station's mid morning slot in October 1993 where he remained until February 2001. In addition to this, in May 1994, Mayo also presented Simon Mayo's Classic Years, where he got to play two hours of classic pop tunes. The show originally went out on a Sunday lunchtime from noon till 2pm, but in November 1994 went out from 10am till noon on Sundays. This lasted until October 1995. In January 1997, Mayo made a brief return to the breakfast show for three weeks when Chris Evans was dismissed, but both Mayo and BBC Radio 1 ruled out the possibilities of a permanent return to the programme. On his first morning as breakfast stand-in, Mayo read out an email from a man who had emigrated to New Zealand four years earlier and had arrived back in the UK that morning, and was \\"delighted to hear you're still doing the breakfast show\\". In 1999 Mayo broke a world record by broadcasting for 37 hours in aid of that year's Comic Relief. This record was broken by Chris Moyles and Dave Vitty on 17 March 2011, when Chris and Dave were doing a 52-hour broadcast. Mayo remained on the mid-morning slot until he left BBC Radio 1 in 2001, seeing breakfast-show presenters Mark Goodier, Steve Wright, Chris Evans, Mark and Lard, Kevin Greening, Zo√´ Ball and Sara Cox, come and go from the slot, but the slot went to Jo Whiley. His final show was on Friday 16 February 2001, and before signing off, he said: \\"One of the reasons I'm not going to do a DLT is that I've nothing to complain about at all ‚Äì though as I'll still be employed by the BBC it'd be a stupid thing to do. I always thought as a kid working at Radio 1 would be the most fun and the best place for any presenter to work and I still think that's true.\\" His final track played on BBC Radio 1 was Ace of Spades by Mot√∂rhead. BBC Radio 5 Live In May 2001, after 15 years of broadcasting with BBC Radio 1, Mayo joined and moved on to another national BBC station, BBC Radio 5 Live to present an afternoon programme. Mayo began broadcasting on BBC Radio 5 Live every weekday from 1pm to 4pm, where he remained until 18 December 2009. He was on air in 2001 when the 9/11 attacks took place in the United States, broadcasting live as the events unfolded. The programme generally combined topical debates, interviews and reviews. It came live from Westminster each Wednesday for live coverage of Prime Minister's Questions, with discussion and debate afterwards with political correspondents and MPs. The programme also featured Mayo's old BBC Radio 1 sidekick Mark Kermode reviewing the new movie releases each Friday afternoon. The banter between Mayo and Kermode in this section of the programme was described by both men as \\"wittertainment at its most wittertaining.\\" (The neologism wittertainment is a portmanteau of witter and entertainment, and was coined in a ‚Äì now deleted ‚Äì Wikipedia entry. However, Kermode and Mayo took note of the article before its deletion and have since been using the term regularly to refer to their show.) In a May 2008 interview with The Guardian, Mayo mentioned he \\"signed a contract for the next two years\\" and was uncertain whether he would still be at BBC Radio 5 Live when it moves to City of Salford. It was later confirmed that Mayo was to move to the BBC Radio 2's drivetime slot, though he will also continue to host a weekly two-hour film review show, Kermode and Mayo's Film Review, on BBC Radio 5 Live with Mark Kermode. In May 2009 Mayo and Kermode won a Gold Sony Radio Award in the Speech Award category, due to continued good work and passion for radio BBC Radio 2 In addition to his daily programme on BBC Radio 5 Live, from October 2001 to April 2007, Mayo hosted the Album Chart show each week for BBC Radio 2. Alongside this, on 2 January 2006, he presented The Ultimate Music Year for the station, where listeners got the chance to vote for their favourite year for music. He has also presented many Sold on Song projects, presented the Top 100 Albums and provided holiday cover for Johnnie Walker on Sundays. From April 2007 ‚Äì April 2008 Mayo took over the Radio 2 Music Club every Monday night from 11:30pm to 12:30am. In January 2010, Mayo took over from Chris Evans on the Drivetime show, noting he was \\"very lucky to be given a second chance in such a high-profile slot.\\" The programme included a number of regular daily features including a \\"Nigel's Recipes\\", \\"Confessions\\", \\"Homework Sucks\\" and \\"The Showstopper\\". Every Friday he hosted \\"All-Request Friday\\" where listeners rang the show and had their favourite song played on the radio after a short interview. The show ended on 4 May 2018 after 8 years, as Mayo was to begin hosting a revamped drivetime show with co-host Jo Whiley from 14 May 2018. On 22 October that year, the station announced that Mayo would be leaving BBC Radio 2 altogether after a backlash against the change, with Whiley moving back to an evening slot. Their last show together aired on 20 December, with Mayo presenting his last show after 17 years with the station the following day. As his opening theme Mayo used the 2003 recording by Jools Holland and Prince Buster of the 1948 song \\"Enjoy Yourself\\" by Carl Sigman and by Herb Magidson. Later editions of the show have also used the popular 1950 hit version by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Incidental music includes \\"Light My Fire\\" by Edmundo Ros. In May 2011, Mayo won a Sony Award for \\"Best Music Show\\" for his work and that of his team on the BBC Radio 2 drive time slot. On 21 December 2018 Simon presented his last show on BBC Radio 2 it being an All Request Friday which featured his jingles which were previously used on his Drivetime show. The last song to be played was Bring Me Sunshine by Morecambe & Wise. Scala Radio On 4 March 2019 at 10am Simon launched the new classical music digital radio station Scala Radio. He now presents the mid-morning programme Mondays to Saturdays. Greatest Hits Radio In 2020, it was announced that Mayo has taken over a weekly album show on Greatest Hits Radio. The show is now broadcast on Sundays from 1-4pm. Other work BBC Radio 4 Mayo presented Act Your Age, a panel game for BBC Radio 4, first broadcast on Radio 4 on 27 November 2008. Television projects Between 1995 and 1998 Mayo presented a TV version of Confessions, based on the hit feature from his BBC Radio 1 breakfast and mid- morning shows. Starting in 1999 he was the original presenter of National Lottery game show Winning Lines on BBC1 until 2000 when he was replaced by Phillip Schofield in 2001. In 2005 he presented a series \\"The Big Dig\\" on BBC TV about allotments in the Rhondda Valley contrasted with others in Highgate, London. Mayo hosted a revival of the classic quiz show Blockbusters, which began airing on Challenge on 14 May 2012 until 3 August 2012. He was the announcer for the concert celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee on 4 June 2012. Books Confessions, based on the hit feature from his BBC Radio 2 drivetime show, and his former BBC Radio 1 breakfast and mid-morning shows. was released in October 2011. The book is a compilation of the best confessions sent to the show by listeners. Mayo's debut novel, Itch, was released on 1 March 2012. The titular protagonist is a fourteen-year-old boy who discovers a previously unknown chemical element. His second novel Itch Rocks was released in February 2013 and the third instalment, Itchcraft, came out in September 2014. His first young adult novel, Blame, was published in July 2016. Mayo's first novel for adults, Mad Blood Stirring, was published in April 2018 and received mixed reviews. It is a historical novel set in Dartmoor Prison in 1815. Clare Clarke, for The Guardian, said: \\"With its huge, amorphous cast and little interior characterisation, its pages rich with Shakespeare‚Äôs poetry and the rousing gospel music for which Block 4 was reputedly renowned, the dialogue-heavy Mad Blood Stirring reads more like a first-draft film treatment than a finished novel. Mayo has served up all the ingredients he could find, but longer cooking would have given it greater depth and subtlety of flavour.\\" The novelist John Boyne said: \\"Bristling with energy, written with passion, Mad Blood Stirring is a joy to read.\\" Radio credits * BBC Radio Nottingham ‚Äì The Simon Mayo Show 10:45am2pm, 19821986 * BBC Radio 1: ** Saturday evenings 7:30pm9:30pm, 19861987 ** Weekend early mornings 6am8am, late 1987 ** MondayThursday evenings 7:30pm10pm, JanuaryMay 1988 ** Breakfast Show 6am9am, May 1988September 1993 ** Mid Morning Show 9am12 noon, October 1993February 2001 * BBC Radio 5 Live: ** Afternoon Show 1pm4pm, May 2001December 2009 ** Kermode and Mayo's Film Review Friday 2pm4pm, January 2010May 2019; 3pm5pm, May 2019 ‚Äì present * BBC Radio 2: ** Album Chart Show Monday evenings 7pm8pm, October 2001April 2007 ** Music Club Monday nights/Tuesday overnight 11:30pm12:30am, April 2007April 2008 ** Drivetime Monday ‚Äì Friday 5pm7pm, 11 January 20104 May 2018 ** Jo Whiley & Simon Mayo ‚Äì Monday ‚Äì Thursday 5pm8pm; Friday 5pm7pm, 14 May 2018 21 December 2018 * BBC Radio 4 ‚Äì Act Your Age 6:30pm, NovemberDecember 2008 * Scala Radio ‚Äì Monday ‚Äì Saturday ‚Äì Mid Morning Show 10am1pm, 4 March 2019 ‚Äì present * Greatest Hits Radio ‚Äì Album Show.

Constitutionally, however, the official language of Malaysia is Malay, but the government from time to time refers to it as Malaysian. Standard Malaysian is a standard form of the Johore-Riau dialect of Malay. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular form of Malay or other native language first. Malay is a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools.Ministry of Education: Frequently Asked Questions ‚Äî To uphold Bahasa Malaysia and to strengthen the English language (MBMMBI) ; access date 3 November 2013 Status Article 152 of the Federation designates Malay as the official language. Between 1986 and 2007, the official term Bahasa Malaysia was replaced by \\"Bahasa Melayu\\". Today, to recognize that Malaysia is composed of many ethnic groups (and not only the ethnic Malays), the term Bahasa Malaysia has once again become the government's preferred designation for the Bahasa Kebangsaan (National Language) and the Bahasa Perpaduan/Penyatu (unifying language/lingua franca). Moreover, the language is also referred to as BM or simply Bahasa.Penggunaan Istilah Bahasa Malaysia Dan Bukan Bahasa Melayu Muktamad, Kata Zainuddin.

Writing system Comparison of the Malay language written in Rumi and Jawi with other languages Traffic signs in Malaysian: Warning sign \\"Level crossing\\" and regulatory sign \\"Stop\\". The script of the Malaysian language is prescribed by law as the Latin alphabet, known in Malay as Rumi (Roman alphabets), provided that the Arabic alphabet called Jawi (or Malay script) is not proscribed for that purpose. Rumi is official while efforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi script and to revive its use in Malaysia. The Latin alphabet, however, is still the most commonly used script in Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes. Borrowed words The Malaysian language has most of its borrowings absorbed from Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Persian, Portuguese, Dutch, Sinitic languages, Arabic and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms). Modern Malaysian Malay has also been influenced lexically by the Indonesian variety, largely through the popularity of Indonesian dramas, soap operas, and music. Colloquial and contemporary usage Colloquial and contemporary usage of Malay includes modern Malaysian vocabulary, which may not be familiar to the older generation, such as awek (girl), balak (guy) or cun (pretty). New plural pronouns have also been formed out of the original pronouns and the word orang (person), such as kitorang (kita + orang, the exclusive \\"we\\", in place of kami) or diorang (dia + orang, \\"they\\"). Code-switching between English and Malaysian and the use of novel loanwords is widespread, forming Bahasa Rojak. Consequently, this phenomenon has raised the displeasure of linguistic purists in Malaysia, in their effort to uphold use of the prescribed standard language.

Oxaloacetic acid, in the form of its conjugate base oxaloacetate, is a metabolic intermediate in many processes that occur in animals. It takes part in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and the citric acid cycle. Properties Oxaloacetic acid undergoes successive deprotonations to give the dianion: :HO2CC(O)CH2CO2H ‚àíO2CC(O)CH2CO2H + H+ pKa = 2.22 :‚àíO2CC(O)CH2CO2H ‚àíO2CC(O)CH2CO2‚àí \\\\+ H+, pKa = 3.89 At high pH, the enolizable proton is ionized: :‚àíO2CC(O)CH2CO2‚àí ‚àíO2CC(O‚àí)CHCO2‚àí \\\\+ H+, pKa = 13.03 The enol forms of oxaloacetic acid are particularly stable, so much so that the two tautomers have different melting points (152 ¬∞C for the cis isoform and 184 ¬∞C for the trans isoform). Biosynthesis Oxaloacetate forms in several ways in nature. A principal route is upon oxidation of L-malate, catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase, in the citric acid cycle. Malate is also oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase in a slow reaction with the initial product being enol-oxaloacetate. It also arises from the condensation of pyruvate with carbonic acid, driven by the hydrolysis of ATP: :CH3C(O)CO2‚àí \\\\+ HCO3‚àí \\\\+ ATP ‚Üí ‚àíO2CCH2C(O)CO2‚àí \\\\+ ADP + Pi Occurring in the mesophyll of plants, this process proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate, catalysed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate can also arise from trans- or de- amination of aspartic acid. Biochemical functions Oxaloacetate is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA to form citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. It is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Oxaloacetate is also a potent inhibitor of complex II. Gluconeogenesis Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions, resulting in the generation of glucose from non- carbohydrates substrates. The beginning of this process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, where pyruvate molecules are found. A pyruvate molecule is carboxylated by a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, activated by a molecule each of ATP and water. This reaction results in the formation of oxaloacetate. NADH reduces oxaloacetate to malate. This transformation is needed to transport the molecule out of the mitochondria. Once in the cytosol, malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate again using NAD+. Then oxaloacetate remains in the cytosol, where the rest of reactions will take place. Oxaloacetate is later decarboxylated and phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and becomes 2-phosphoenolpyruvate using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as phosphate source. Glucose is obtained after further downstream processing. Urea cycle The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway that results in the formation of urea using two ammonium molecules and one bicarbonate molecule. This route commonly occurs in hepatocytes. The reactions related to the urea cycle produce NADH), and NADH can be produced in two different ways. One of these uses oxaloacetate. In the cytosol there are fumarate molecules. Fumarate can be transformed into malate by the actions of the enzyme fumarase. Malate is acted on by malate dehydrogenase to become oxaloacetate, producing a molecule of NADH. After that, oxaloacetate will be recycled to aspartate, as transaminases prefer these keto acids over the others. This recycling maintains the flow of nitrogen into the cell. Relationship of oxaloacetic acid, malic acid, and aspartic acid Glyoxylate cycle The glyoxylate cycle is a variant of the citric acid cycle. It is an anabolic pathway occurring in plants and bacteria utilizing the enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. Some intermediate steps of the cycle are slightly different from the citric acid cycle; nevertheless oxaloacetate has the same function in both processes. This means that oxaloacetate in this cycle also acts as the primary reactant and final product. In fact the oxaloacetate is a net product of the glyoxylate cycle because its loop of the cycle incorporates two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Fatty acid synthesis In previous stages acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm where fatty acid synthase resides. The acetyl-CoA is transported as a citrate, which has been previously formed in the mitochondrial matrix from acetyl-coA and oxaloacetate. This reaction usually initiates the citric acid cycle, but when there is no need of energy it is transported to the cytoplasm where it is broken down to cytoplasmatic acetyl -CoA and oxaloacetate. Another part of the cycle requires NADPH for the synthesis of fatty acids. Part of this reducing power is generated when the cytosolic oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondria as long as the internal mitochondrial layer is non-permeable for oxaloacetate. Firstly the oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH. Then the malate is decarboxylated to pyruvate. Now this pyruvate can easily enter the mitochondria, where it is carboxylated again to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. In this way, the transfer of acetyl-CoA that is from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm produces a molecule of NADH. The overall reaction, which is spontaneous, may be summarized as: :HCO3‚Äì \\\\+ ATP + acetyl- CoA ‚Üí ADP + Pi \\\\+ malonyl-CoA Amino acid synthesis Six essential amino acids and three nonessential are synthesized from oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Aspartate and alanine are formed from oxaloacetate and pyruvate, respectively, by transamination from glutamate. Asparagine, methionine, lysine and threonine are synthesized by aspartate, therefore given importance to oxaloacetate as without it, no aspartate would be formed and the following other amino acids would neither be produced.

The force was established by the Allies under the codename \\"Maroubra\\", referring to the troops in the forward area, it was one of many units forming the body of the New Guinea Force, the main Allied army formation in the South West Pacific Area during 1942. Formed on 21 June 1942, it initially consisted of part-time Militia units and was under the command of Major General Basil Morris's New Guinea Force. Reinforced by veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units, Maroubra Force was instrumental in blunting the Japanese advance on Port Moresby, fighting it to a standstill in September, before elements of the 7th Division undertook a counter-attack in October and November 1942, which drove the Japanese back to their beachheads around Buna-Gona, which was the scene of heavy fighting between November 1942 and January 1943. History In mid-1942, Major General Basil Morris, commander of New Guinea Force, ordered the 39th Infantry Battalion, which had previously been deployed as a garrison force around Port Moresby, was sent overland via the Kokoda Track to secure the Kokoda area and prepare to defend against a Japanese advance. The Papuan Infantry Battalion of about 300 native troops with white officers, was already north of the Owen Stanley Range at the entrance of the Kokoda Track. These units were subsequently grouped together as \\"Maroubra Force\\" - named for Operation Maroubra, which was the Allied name for the troops in the \\"forward area\\" on the Kokoda Track - formed around the units of Brigadier Selwyn Porter's 30th Brigade, which was made up of part-time Militia soldiers. On 21 July 1942, the Japanese landed on the northeast coast of Papua and the Papuan Infantry Battalion was overwhelmed by the Japanese troops, and the entrance was captured on 29 July 1942. alt=A parade of tired-looking soldiers in a jungle setting Bolstered by the arrival of the 53rd Infantry Battalion in early August, Maroubra Force then successfully fought to delay the Japanese advance through the Owen Stanley Range, before being reinforced by Second Australian Imperial Force troops from the 21st Brigade and finally halting the Japanese around Ioribaiwa. The 25th Brigade, later reinforced by the 16th Brigade, then pursued the Japanese north from Ioribaiwa as the Japanese withdrew back to their beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda on the Papuan north coast. Within sources dealing with the fighting in New Guinea, Maroubra Force remains an enigmatic entity. While authors such as Eustace Keogh, Brune and McCarthy largely fall silent on the formation after the Battle of Ioribaiwa in mid-September, Chant states that Maroubra Force later participated in the fighting around Gona. Nevertheless, the last mention of the Maroubra codename in the New Guinea Force Headquarters War Diary appears on 28 October. During the fighting around Buna and Gona, between in November 1942 and January 1943, Porter's 30th Brigade, which had been withdrawn earlier, reinforced elements of the 7th Division - the 18th and 25th Brigades - and eventually took part in the reduction of the Japanese beachhead there. The 21st Brigade also took part in the fighting around the Japanese beachheads, suffering heavy casualties. Commanders An ad hoc command, Maroubra Force was variously commanded by the senior officer in the forward area of the battle, which meant that command changed hands on a number of occasions. Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Allan Cameron took command of the formation during the fighting around Kokoda after the death of Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, while Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner filled the role during the brief period between Kokoda and Isurava. Brigadier Selwyn Porter (30th Brigade) and Brigadier Arnold Potts (21st Brigade) also held the position. Potts was later relieved of his command in controversial circumstances following actions at Isurava, Eora Creek and Templeton's Crossing, and Efogi. He was replaced by Porter in early September prior to the Battle of Ioribaiwa. Maroubra Force then passed to Brigadier Kenneth Eather, commander of the 25th Brigade, for the fighting around Ioribaiwa and the counter-offensive that followed. Strength and casualties According to Chant, \\"at its peak strength, Maroubra Force consisted of the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, and the 21st Brigade (2/14th, 2/16th and 2/27th Infantry Battalions). The 53rd Militia Battalion saw action briefly during the Battle of Isurava but was defeated and subsequently withdrew greatly demoralised, especially after the commanding officer and many senior officers of the 53rd were killed in action\\". Williams provides a contrasting assessment, though, stating that just prior the fighting around Ioribaiwa, following the arrival of the 25th Brigade, Maroubra Force totaled 2,957 personnel - up from 2,292 at the start of Isurava - with a combined headquarters from both the 21st and 25th Brigades, the 25th Brigade's three infantry battalions, a composite 21st Brigade infantry battalion, and various supporting elements including a signals detachment, medical support and a small reconnaissance element. These forces lacked artillery support, as the Australians' limited artillery resources were concentrated around Port Moresby at the start of the campaign, and due to logistical issues they were unable to move the guns forward along the track to support the infantry in the forward areas. The fighting around Kokoda and Buna‚ÄìGona resulted in heavy casualties for Maroubra Force. According to James, the fighting along the Kokoda Track left over 600 Australians dead with more than 1,600 wounded over a four-month period for the total force engaged (not just Maroubra Force); there were further casualties around Buna and Gona also. The example of the 39th Infantry Battalion highlights the intensity of the fighting. By the end of the fighting in January 1943, according to Chant, the 39th Battalion had been so heavily depleted there were only 30 fully fit personnel available from a nominal strength of between 600 and 800. The remainder were either \\"dead, missing, wounded, or in hospitals in Port Moresby and northern Australia suffering from disease and exhaustion\\". It was subsequently evacuated to Port Moresby before returning to Australia, where the 30th Brigade was eventually disbanded, with many of its personnel being redistributed to 2nd AIF units. Maroubra Force, and its commanding officers Honner and Potts are sometimes cited as some of \\"the men who saved Australia\\", having played an important part in the successful defence of Port Moresby.

In this process, the metal remains in the solid phase and the liquid can be discarded. Bacterial oxidation is a biohydrometallurgical process developed for pre- cyanidation treatment of refractory gold ores or concentrates. The bacterial culture is a mixed culture of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans. The bacterial oxidation process comprises contacting refractory sulfide ROM ore or concentrate with a strain of the bacterial culture for a suitable treatment period under an optimum operating environment. The bacteria oxidise the sulfide minerals, thus liberating the occluded gold for subsequent recovery via cyanidation. The BIOX¬Æ process is a proprietary technology owned by Biomin South Africa and used under licence by a number of operating mines. The BIOX¬Æ process involves bacterial oxidation in agitated tanks for pre-treatment of refractory ores and concentrates ahead of conventional cyanide leach for gold recovery. Under controlled continuous plant conditions, the number of bacterial cells and their activity is optimised to attain the highest rate of sulfide oxidation. The bacteria require a very acidic environment (pH 1.0 to 4.0), a temperature of between 30 and 45 ¬∞C, and a steady supply of oxygen and carbon dioxide for optimum growth and activity. The unusual operating conditions for the bacteria are not favourable for the growth of most other microbes, thus eliminating the need for sterility during the bacterial oxidation process. Because organic substances are toxic to the bacteria, they are non-pathogenic and incapable of causing disease. The bacteria employed in the process do not, therefore, pose a health risk to humans or any animals. The bacterial oxidation of iron sulfide minerals produces iron(III) sulfate and sulfuric acid, and in the case of arsenopyrite, arsenic acid is also produced. The arsenic is removed from the liquor by coprecipitation with the iron and sulfate in a two-stage neutralisation process. This produces a solid neutralisation precipitate containing largely calcium sulfate, basic iron(III) arsenate and iron(III) hydroxide. The iron(III) arsenate is sufficiently insoluble and stable to allow the neutralisation product to be safely disposed of on a slimes dam. The neutralisation liquor, purified to contain an acceptable level of arsenic, can be re-used in the milling, flotation or bacterial oxidation circuits.

A local government can choose to adopt a model building code as its own. This saves local governments the expense and trouble of developing their own codes. Many smaller governments lack the expertise to do so. Overview The concept of the model building codes has successfully been applied since the early 1900s in the countries where regulation of building construction is a responsibility of the local authorities. The popularity of model building codes can be attributed to two factors: (a) the developing of proprietary building codes is prohibitively expensive and (b) the ability of the model codes to accommodate local conditions. Since modern building regulations are very complex, their development and effective maintenance are far beyond the technical and financial capabilities of most jurisdictions. Rather than drafting its own building codes, a local authority might choose to use the model building codes instead. The model building codes are either adopted (accepted without modifications) or adapted (modified) to a particular jurisdiction and then enforced by the adopting authority. Model building codes are developed by standards organizations through a network of development committees with representatives from the various affected entities, both government and private. This method allows the pooling of financial and intellectual resources to produce codes that remain current and technically sound. The model code developers are constantly working to update their codes to incorporate latest research results and building technologies. The model code developers are generally funded by the sales of the model codes, the reprint royalties, and the consulting services they may offer to the adopting authorities and code users. Application European Union and Canada United States In the United States, model building codes are adopted by the state governments, counties, fire districts, and municipalities. A number of federal agencies‚Äîincluding the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Park Service, the Department of State and the Forest Service‚Äîuse private-sector model codes for projects funded by the federal government. Normally, model building codes have a 3‚Äì5 year update cycle. That is, a new edition of the building code comes out every 3 to 5 years. However, due to the length of time that it takes for a jurisdiction to review and approve a new code, the currently enforced version of the local code is often not the most recent edition of the model building code on which the adopted code is based. Also, when any given jurisdiction adopts a model building code, it adopts a specific edition of the model code (for example, the 1997 Uniform Building Code or the 2006 International Building Code), which then becomes the law of that jurisdiction. As a result of this practice, the adopted codes are not automatically updated. When a new edition of the model code is released by the model code developer, the adopting authority may choose to ignore it and continue using the older version of the model code it adopted. Otherwise, the jurisdiction must vote to update its code and bring its inspectors up to date on the changes being made to the code. Most jurisdictions update their codes regularly to avoid backlash from architects and building contractors who respond to outdated codes by seeking variances to permit the use of more efficient design solutions and technologies accepted in areas using more modern codes. The model codes may either be adopted outright as the building codes for a jurisdiction, or they may be adopted with amendments or additional rules. In some cases, the amendments or additional requirements and exemptions are issued as a separate document or, in other cases, the jurisdiction may print, under its own title, a merged code, incorporating all of the local revisions. For example, the City of Los Angeles 2011 Building Code is based on the 2009 International Building Code, which is a model code developed by the International Code Council (ICC). In the wake of the 2002 case Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int'l, Inc.,Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int'l, Inc., 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002). the organization Public Resource has published a substantial portion of the enacted building codes on- line, and they are available as .pdf's which are freely downloadable.bulk.resource.org/codes.gov Public Resource website The Veeck case has had the effect of placing the text of the adopted model codes into the public domain, although the model codes themselves, until they are adopted into law, are not in the public domain.

In physiology, muscle contraction does not necessarily mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length, such as when holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: length and tension. A muscle contraction is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same. In contrast, a muscle contraction is isotonic if muscle tension remains the same throughout the contraction. If the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in muscles that contract during locomotor activity. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons to produce muscle contractions. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, which is explained by the sliding filament theory. The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of action potentials. In skeletal muscles, muscle tension is at its greatest when the muscle is stretched to an intermediate length as described by the length- tension relationship. Unlike skeletal muscle, the contractions of smooth and cardiac muscles are myogenic (meaning that they are initiated by the smooth or heart muscle cells themselves instead of being stimulated by an outside event such as nerve stimulation), although they can be modulated by stimuli from the autonomic nervous system. The mechanisms of contraction in these muscle tissues are similar to those in skeletal muscle tissues. Types Types of muscle contractions Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: force and length. Force itself can be differentiated as either tension or load. Muscle tension is the force exerted by the muscle on an object whereas a load is the force exerted by an object on the muscle. When muscle tension changes without any corresponding changes in muscle length, the muscle contraction is described as isometric. If the muscle length changes while muscle tension remains the same, then the muscle contraction is isotonic. In an isotonic contraction, the muscle length can either shorten to produce a concentric contraction or lengthen to produce an eccentric contraction. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain constant when the muscle is active during locomotor activity.  Isometric contraction  An isometric contraction of a muscle generates tension without changing length. An example can be found when the muscles of the hand and forearm grip an object; the joints of the hand do not move, but muscles generate sufficient force to prevent the object from being dropped.  Isotonic contraction  In isotonic contraction, the tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in muscle length. This occurs when a muscle's force of contraction matches the total load on the muscle.  Concentric contraction  In concentric contraction, muscle tension is sufficient to overcome the load, and the muscle shortens as it contracts. This occurs when the force generated by the muscle exceeds the load opposing its contraction. During a concentric contraction, a muscle is stimulated to contract according to the sliding filament theory. This occurs throughout the length of the muscle, generating a force at the origin and insertion, causing the muscle to shorten and changing the angle of the joint. In relation to the elbow, a concentric contraction of the biceps would cause the arm to bend at the elbow as the hand moved from the leg to the shoulder (a biceps curl). A concentric contraction of the triceps would change the angle of the joint in the opposite direction, straightening the arm and moving the hand towards the leg.  Eccentric contraction  In eccentric contraction, the tension generated while isometric is insufficient to overcome the external load on the muscle and the muscle fibers lengthen as they contract. Rather than working to pull a joint in the direction of the muscle contraction, the muscle acts to decelerate the joint at the end of a movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load. This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is 'smoothing out' a movement or resisting gravity such as during downhill walking). Over the short-term, strength training involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase muscular strength more than training with concentric contractions alone. However, exercise- induced muscle damage is also greater during lengthening contractions. During an eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement while bent and then straightens as the hand moves away from the shoulder. During an eccentric contraction of the triceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement straight and then bends as the hand moves towards the shoulder. Desmin, titin, and other z-line proteins are involved in eccentric contractions, but their mechanism is poorly understood in comparison to crossbridge cycling in concentric contractions. Though the muscle is doing a negative amount of mechanical work, (work is being done on the muscle), chemical energy (originally of oxygen, Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). \\"Oxygen Is the High-Energy Molecule Powering Complex Multicellular Life: Fundamental Corrections to Traditional Bioenergetics ACS Omega 5: 2221-2233. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03352 unlocked by fat or glucose, and temporarily stored in ATP) is nevertheless consumed, although less than would be consumed during a concentric contraction of the same force. For example, one expends more energy going up a flight of stairs than going down the same flight. Muscles undergoing heavy eccentric loading suffer greater damage when overloaded (such as during muscle building or strength training exercise) as compared to concentric loading. When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called negatives. During a concentric contraction, muscle myofilaments slide past each other, pulling the Z-lines together. During an eccentric contraction, the myofilaments slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known. Exercise featuring a heavy eccentric load can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and delayed onset muscle soreness one to two days after training. Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone. While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to overtraining, moderate training may confer protection against injury. = Eccentric contractions in movement = Eccentric contractions normally occur as a braking force in opposition to a concentric contraction to protect joints from damage. During virtually any routine movement, eccentric contractions assist in keeping motions smooth, but can also slow rapid movements such as a punch or throw. Part of training for rapid movements such as pitching during baseball involves reducing eccentric braking allowing a greater power to be developed throughout the movement. Eccentric contractions are being researched for their ability to speed rehabilitation of weak or injured tendons. Achilles tendinitis and patellar tendonitis (also known as jumper's knee or patellar tendonosis) have been shown to benefit from high-load eccentric contractions. Vertebrates In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: 1) skeletal, 2) smooth, and 3) cardiac In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle constitutes the majority of muscle mass in the body and is responsible for locomotor activity. Smooth muscle forms blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and other areas in the body that produce sustained contractions. Cardiac muscle make up the heart, which pumps blood. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are called striated muscle because of their striped appearance under a microscope, which is due to the highly organized alternating pattern of A bands and I bands. Skeletal muscle Organization of skeletal muscle Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscles contractions occur as a result of conscious effort originating in the brain. The brain sends electrochemical signals through the nervous system to the motor neuron that innervates several muscle fibers. In the case of some reflexes, the signal to contract can originate in the spinal cord through a feedback loop with the grey matter. Other actions such as locomotion, breathing, and chewing have a reflex aspect to them: the contractions can be initiated both consciously or unconsciously. Neuromuscular junction Structure of neuromuscular junction. A neuromuscular junction is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is the site in which a motor neuron transmits a signal to a muscle fiber to initiate muscle contraction. The sequence of events that results in the depolarization of the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential is initiated in the cell body of a motor neuron, which is then propagated by saltatory conduction along its axon toward the neuromuscular junction. Once it reaches the terminal bouton, the action potential causes a ion influx into the terminal by way of the voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx causes synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft between the motor neuron terminal and the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscle fiber. Acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the neuromuscular junction. Activation of the nicotinic receptor opens its intrinsic sodium/potassium channel, causing sodium to rush in and potassium to trickle out. As a result, the sarcolemma reverses polarity and its voltage quickly jumps from the resting membrane potential of -90mV to as high as +75mV as sodium enters. The membrane potential then becomes hyperpolarized when potassium exits and is then adjusted back to the resting membrane potential. This rapid fluctuation is called the end-plate potentialSaladin, Kenneth S., Stephen J. Sullivan, and Christina A. Gan. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Education, 2015. Print. The voltage-gated ion channels of the sarcolemma next to the end plate open in response to the end plate potential. They are sodium and potassium specific and only allow one through. This wave of ion movements creates the action potential that spreads from the motor end plate in all directions. If action potentials stop arriving, then acetylcholine ceases to be released from the terminal bouton. The remaining acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is either degraded by active acetylcholine esterase or reabsorbed by the synaptic knob and none is left to replace the degraded acetylcholine. Excitation-contraction coupling Excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling is the process by which a muscular action potential in the muscle fiber causes the myofibrils to contract. In skeletal muscle, excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling relies on a direct coupling between key proteins, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release channel (identified as the ryanodine receptor, RyR) and voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (identified as dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs). DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma (which includes the surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubules), while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane. The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling takes place. Excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscle cell results in a muscle action potential, which spreads across the cell surface and into the muscle fiber's network of T-tubules, thereby depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber. Depolarization of the inner portions activates dihydropyridine receptors in the terminal cisternae, which are in close proximity to ryanodine receptors in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes (involving conformational changes that allosterically activates the ryanodine receptors). As the ryanodine receptors open, is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the local junctional space and diffuses into the bulk cytoplasm to cause a calcium spark. Note that the sarcoplasmic reticulum has a large calcium buffering capacity partially due to a calcium-binding protein called calsequestrin. The near synchronous activation of thousands of calcium sparks by the action potential causes a cell-wide increase in calcium giving rise to the upstroke of the calcium transient. The released into the cytosol binds to Troponin C by the actin filaments, to allow crossbridge cycling, producing force and, in some situations, motion. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) actively pumps back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As declines back to resting levels, the force declines and relaxation occurs. Sliding filament theory Sliding filament theory: A sarcomere in relaxed (above) and contracted (below) positions The sliding filament theory describes a process used by muscles to contract. It is a cycle of repetitive events that cause a thin filament to slide over a thick filament and generate tension in the muscle. It was independently developed by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson in 1954. Physiologically, this contraction is not uniform across the sarcomere; the central position of the thick filaments becomes unstable and can shift during contraction. However the actions of elastic proteins such as titin are hypothesised to maintain uniform tension across the sarcomere and pull the thick filament into a central position. =Crossbridge cycling= Crossbridge cycling Crossbridge cycling is a sequence of molecular events that underlies the sliding filament theory. A crossbridge is a myosin projection, consisting of two myosin heads, that extends from the thick filaments. Each myosin head has two binding sites: one for ATP and another for actin. The binding of ATP to a myosin head detaches myosin from actin, thereby allowing myosin to bind to another actin molecule. Once attached, the ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, which uses the released energy to move into the \\"cocked position\\" whereby it binds weakly to a part of the actin binding site. The remainder of the actin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin. With the ATP hydrolyzed, the cocked myosin head now contains ADP + Pi. Two ions bind to troponin C on the actin filaments. The troponin- complex causes tropomyosin to slide over and unblock the remainder of the actin binding site. Unblocking the rest of the actin binding sites allows the two myosin heads to close and myosin to bind strongly to actin. The myosin head then releases the inorganic phosphate and initiates a power stroke, which generates a force of 2 pN. The power stroke moves the actin filament inwards, thereby shortening the sarcomere. Myosin then releases ADP but still remains tightly bound to actin. At the end of the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, leaving myosin attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin. A lack of ATP would result in the rigor state characteristic of rigor mortis. Once another ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head will again detach from actin and another crossbridges cycle occurs. Crossbridge cycling is able to continue as long as there are sufficient amounts of ATP and in the cytoplasm. Termination of crossbridge cycling can occur when is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the muscle relaxes. The ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of ions from the troponin. Thus, the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin filaments and contraction ceases. Gradation of skeletal muscle contractions The strength of skeletal muscle contractions can be broadly separated into twitch, summation, and tetanus. A twitch is a single contraction and relaxation cycle produced by an action potential within the muscle fiber itself. The time between a stimulus to the motor nerve and the subsequent contraction of the innervated muscle is called the latent period, which usually takes about 10 ms and is caused by the time taken for nerve action potential to propagate, the time for chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction, then the subsequent steps in excitation-contraction coupling. If another muscle action potential were to be produced before the complete relaxation of a muscle twitch, then the next twitch will simply sum onto the previous twitch, thereby producing a summation. Summation can be achieved in two ways: frequency summation and multiple fiber summation. In frequency summation, the force exerted by the skeletal muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when humans are exerting their muscles as hard as they are consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in each of those muscles will fire at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This 'low' level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon--the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body. In multiple fiber summation, if the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones. As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger. A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required. Finally, if the frequency of muscle action potentials increases such that the muscle contraction reaches its peak force and plateaus at this level, then the contraction is a tetanus. Length-tension relationship Muscle length versus isometric force Length-tension relationship relates the strength of an isometric contraction to the length of the muscle at which the contraction occurs. Muscles operate with greatest active tension when close to an ideal length (often their resting length). When stretched or shortened beyond this (whether due to the action of the muscle itself or by an outside force), the maximum active tension generated decreases. This decrease is minimal for small deviations, but the tension drops off rapidly as the length deviates further from the ideal. Due to the presence of elastic proteins within a muscle cell (such as titin) and extracellular matrix, as the muscle is stretched beyond a given length, there is an entirely passive tension, which opposes lengthening. Combined together, there is a strong resistance to lengthening an active muscle far beyond the peak of active tension. Force-velocity relationships Force‚Äìvelocity relationship: right of the vertical axis concentric contractions (the muscle is shortening), left of the axis eccentric contractions (the muscle is lengthened under load); power developed by the muscle in red. Since power is equal to force times velocity, the muscle generates no power at either isometric force (due to zero velocity) or maximal velocity (due to zero force). The optimal shortening velocity for power generation is approximately one-third of maximum shortening velocity. Force‚Äìvelocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched ‚Äì force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum. This intrinsic property of active muscle tissue plays a role in the active damping of joints that are actuated by simultaneously-active opposing muscles. In such cases, the force-velocity profile enhances the force produced by the lengthening muscle at the expense of the shortening muscle. This favoring of whichever muscle returns the joint to equilibrium effectively increases the damping of the joint. Moreover, the strength of the damping increases with muscle force. The motor system can thus actively control joint damping via the simultaneous contraction (co- contraction) of opposing muscle groups. Smooth muscle Swellings called varicosities belonging to an autonomic neuron innervate the smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles can be divided into two subgroups: single-unit (unitary) and multi-unit. Single-unit smooth muscle cells can be found in the gut and blood vessels. Because these cells are linked together by gap junctions, they are able to contract as a syncytium. Single-unit smooth muscle cells contract myogenically, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. Unlike single-unit smooth muscle cells, multi-unit smooth muscle cells are found in the muscle of the eye and in the base of hair follicles. Multi-unit smooth muscle cells contract by being separately stimulated by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. As such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle. Mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction The contractile activity of smooth muscle cells is influenced by multiple inputs such as spontaneous electrical activity, neural and hormonal inputs, local changes in chemical composition, and stretch. This is in contrast to the contractile activity of skeletal muscle cells, which relies on a single neural input. Some types of smooth muscle cells are able to generate their own action potentials spontaneously, which usually occur following a pacemaker potential or a slow wave potential. These action potentials are generated by the influx of extracellular , and not . Like skeletal muscles, cytosolic ions are also required for crossbridge cycling in smooth muscle cells. The two sources for cytosolic in smooth muscle cells are the extracellular entering through calcium channels and the ions that are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The elevation of cytosolic results in more binding to calmodulin, which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase. The calcium-calmodulin-myosin light-chain kinase complex phosphorylates myosin on the 20 kilodalton (kDa) myosin light chains on amino acid residue-serine 19, initiating contraction and activating the myosin ATPase. Unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells lack troponin, even though they contain the thin filament protein tropomyosin and other notable proteins ‚Äì caldesmon and calponin. Thus, smooth muscle contractions are initiated by the -activated phosphorylation of myosin rather than binding to the troponin complex that regulates myosin binding sites on actin like in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Termination of crossbridge cycling (and leaving the muscle in latch-state) occurs when myosin light chain phosphatase removes the phosphate groups from the myosin heads. Phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle. During this period, there is a rapid burst of energy utilization as measured by oxygen consumption. Within a few minutes of initiation, the calcium level markedly decreases, the 20 kDa myosin light chains' phosphorylation decreases, and energy utilization decreases; however, force in tonic smooth muscle is maintained. During contraction of muscle, rapidly cycling crossbridges form between activated actin and phosphorylated myosin, generating force. It is hypothesized that the maintenance of force results from dephosphorylated \\"latch-bridges\\" that slowly cycle and maintain force. A number of kinases such as rho kinase, ZIP kinase, and protein kinase C are believed to participate in the sustained phase of contraction, and flux may be significant. Neuromodulation Although smooth muscle contractions are myogenic, the rate and strength of their contractions can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. Postganglionic nerve fibers of parasympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) on smooth muscle cells. These receptors are metabotropic, or G-protein coupled receptors that initiate a second messenger cascade. Conversely, postganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine, which bind to adrenergic receptors that are also metabotropic. The exact effects on the smooth muscle depend on the specific characteristics of the receptor activated‚Äîboth parasympathetic input and sympathetic input can be either excitatory (contractile) or inhibitory (relaxing). Cardiac muscle Cardiac muscle There are two types of cardiac muscle cells: autorhythmic and contractile. Autorhythmic cells do not contract, but instead set the pace of contraction for other cardiac muscle cells, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. In contrast, contractile muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) constitute the majority of the heart muscle and are able to contract. Excitation-contraction coupling Unlike skeletal muscle, excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling in cardiac muscle is thought to depend primarily on a mechanism called calcium-induced calcium release. Though the proteins involved are similar, the L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are not physically coupled. Instead, RyRs are activated by a calcium trigger, which is brought about by the flow of through the L-type calcium channels. Furthermore, cardiac muscle tend to exhibit diad (or dyad) structures, rather than triads. Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells occurs when an action potential is initiated by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node or Atrioventricular node and conducted to all cells in the heart via gap junctions. The action potential travels along the surface membrane into T-tubules (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes extracellular to enter the cell via L-type calcium channels and possibly sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) during the early part of the plateau phase. This influx causes a small local increase in intracellular . The increase in is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases in a positive feedback physiological response. This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release and gives rise to calcium sparks ( sparks). The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. The increase in cytosolic calcium following the flow of calcium through the cell membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum is moderated by calcium buffers, which bind a large proportion of intracellular calcium. As a result, a large increase in total calcium leads to a relatively small rise in free . The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above). Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament toward the centre of the sarcomere. Key proteins involved in cardiac calcium cycling and excitation-contraction coupling Following systole, intracellular calcium is taken up by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin. Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. Some calcium is also taken up by the mitochondria. An enzyme, phospholamban, serves as a brake for SERCA. At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that does not have to leave the cell entirely. At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus taking most from the cytoplasm back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Once again, calcium buffers moderate this fall in concentration, permitting a relatively small decrease in free concentration in response to a large change in total calcium. The falling concentration allows the troponin complex to dissociate from the actin filament thereby ending contraction. The heart relaxes, allowing the ventricles to fill with blood and begin the cardiac cycle again. Invertebrates Circular and longitudinal muscles A simplified image showing earthworm movement via peristalsis In annelids such as earthworms and leeches, circular and longitudinal muscles cells form the body wall of these animals and are responsible for their movement. In an earthworm that is moving through a soil, for example, contractions of circular and longitudinal muscles occur reciprocally while the coelomic fluid serves as a hydroskeleton by maintaining turgidity of the earthworm. When the circular muscles in the anterior segments contract, the anterior portion of animal's body begins to constrict radially, which pushes the incompressible coelomic fluid forward and increasing the length of the animal. As a result, the front end of the animal moves forward. As the front end of the earthworm becomes anchored and the circular muscles in the anterior segments become relaxed, a wave of longitudinal muscle contractions passes backwards, which pulls the rest of animal's trailing body forward. These alternating waves of circular and longitudinal contractions is called peristalsis, which underlies the creeping movement of earthworms. Obliquely striated muscles Invertebrates such as annelids, mollusks, and nematodes, possess obliquely striated muscles, which contain bands of thick and thin filaments that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles. In bivalves, the obliquely striated muscles can maintain tension over long periods without using too much energy. Bivalves use these muscles to keep their shells closed. Asynchronous muscles right|thumb|Asynchronous muscles power flight in most insect species. a: Wings b: Wing joint c: Dorsoventral muscles power the upstroke d: Dorsolongitudinal muscles (DLM) power the downstroke. The DLMs are oriented out of the page. Advanced insects such as wasps, flies, bees, and beetles possess asynchronous muscles that constitute the flight muscles in these animals. These flight muscles are often called fibrillar muscles because they contain myofibrils that are thick and conspicuous. A remarkable feature of these muscles is that they do not require stimulation for each muscle contraction. Hence, they are called asynchronous muscles because the number of contractions in these muscles do not correspond (or synchronize) with the number of action potentials. For example, a wing muscle of a tethered fly may receive action potentials at a frequency of 3 Hz but it is able to beat at a frequency of 120 Hz. The high frequency beating is made possible because the muscles are connected to a resonant system, which is driven to a natural frequency of vibration. History Electrodes touch a frog, and the legs twitch into the upward positionDavid Ames Wells, The science of common things: a familiar explanation of the first, 323 pages ( page 290) In 1780, Luigi Galvani discovered that the muscles of dead frogs' legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark. This was one of the first forays into the study of bioelectricity, a field that still studies the electrical patterns and signals in tissues such as nerves and muscles. In 1952, the term excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling was coined to describe the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response. This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, whereby the electrical stimulus is usually an action potential and the mechanical response is contraction. Excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling can be dysregulated in many diseases. Though excitation‚Äìcontraction coupling has been known for over half a century, it is still an active area of biomedical research. The general scheme is that an action potential arrives to depolarize the cell membrane. By mechanisms specific to the muscle type, this depolarization results in an increase in cytosolic calcium that is called a calcium transient. This increase in calcium activates calcium-sensitive contractile proteins that then use ATP to cause cell shortening. The mechanism for muscle contraction evaded scientists for years and requires continued research and updating. The sliding filament theory was independently developed by Andrew F. Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson. Their findings were published as two consecutive papers published in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature under the common theme \\"Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction\\".

It is an analysis of the social and theoretical mechanisms behind the changes that occurred in Western penal systems during the modern age based on historical documents from France. Foucault argues that prison did not become the principal form of punishment just because of the humanitarian concerns of reformists. He traces the cultural shifts that led to the predominance of prison via the body and power. Prison used by the \\"disciplines\\" ‚Äì new technological powers that can also be found, according to Foucault, in places such as schools, hospitals, and military barracks. In a later work, Security, Territory, Population, Foucault admitted that he was somewhat overzealous in his argument that disciplinary power conditions society; he amended and developed his earlier ideas.Security, Territory, Population, p.48-50 (2007) Summary The main ideas of Discipline and Punish can be grouped according to its four parts: torture, punishment, discipline, and prison. Torture Foucault begins by contrasting two forms of penalty: the violent and chaotic public torture of Robert-Fran√ßois Damiens, who was convicted of attempted regicide in the mid-18th century, and the highly regimented daily schedule for inmates from an early 19th-century prison (Mettray). These examples provide a picture of just how profound the changes in Western penal systems were after less than a century. Foucault wants the reader to consider what led to these changes and how Western attitudes shifted so radically.Sargiacomo, M. (2009). Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison. Journal of Management and Governance, 13(3), 269-280. He believes that the question of the nature of these changes is best asked by assuming that they were not used to create a more humanitarian penal system, nor to more exactly punish or rehabilitate, but as part of a continuing trajectory of subjection. Foucault wants to tie scientific knowledge and technological development to the development of the prison to prove this point. He defines a \\"micro-physics\\" of power, which is constituted by a power that is strategic and tactical rather than acquired, preserved or possessed. He explains that power and knowledge imply one another, as opposed to the common belief that knowledge exists independently of power relations (knowledge is always contextualized in a framework which makes it intelligible, so the humanizing discourse of psychiatry is an expression of the tactics of oppression).Discipline and Punish, p.26-27 (1977) That is, the ground of the game of power is not won by \\"liberation\\", because liberation already exists as a facet of subjection. \\"The man described for us, whom we are invited to free, is already in himself the effect of a subjection much more profound than himself.\\"\\"Discipline and Punish\\", p. 30 (1977) The problem for Foucault is in some sense a theoretical modelling which posits a soul, an identity (the use of soul being fortunate since \\"identity\\" or \\"name\\" would not properly express the method of subjection‚Äîe.g., if mere materiality were used as a way of tracking individuals then the method of punishment would not have switched from torture to psychiatry) which allows a whole materiality of prison to develop. In \\"What is an Author?\\" Foucault also deals with notion of identity, and its use as a method of control, regulation, and tracking. He begins by examining public torture and execution. He argues that the public spectacle of torture and execution was a theatrical forum, the original intentions of which eventually produced several unintended consequences. Foucault stresses the exactitude with which torture is carried out, and describes an extensive legal framework in which it operates to achieve specific purposes. Foucault describes public torture as a ceremony. The intended purposes were: * To make the secret public (according to Foucault, the investigation was kept entirely secret even from the accused). The secret of the investigation and the conclusion of the magistrates was justified by the publicity of the torture. * To show the effect of investigation on confession. (According to Foucault, torture could occur during the investigation, because partial proofs meant partial guilt. If the torture failed to elicit a confession then the investigation was stopped and innocence assumed. A confession legitimized the investigation and any torture that occurred.) * Reflecting the violence of the original crime onto the convict's body for all to see, in order for it to be manifested then annulled by reciprocating the violence of the crime on the criminal. * Enacting the revenge upon the convict's body, which the monarch seeks for having been injured by the crime. Foucault argues that the law was considered an extension of the sovereign's body, and so the revenge must take the form of harming the convict's body. > \\"It [torture] assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the > secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation of the > confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the visible body > of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to be manifested and > annulled. It also made the body of the condemned man the place where the > vengeance of the sovereign was applied, the anchoring point for a > manifestation of power, an opportunity of affirming the dissymmetry of > forces.\\"\\"Discipline and Punish\\", p.55 (1977) Foucault looks at public torture as the outcome \\"of a certain mechanism of power\\" that views crime in a military schema. Crime and rebellion are akin to a declaration of war. The sovereign was not concerned with demonstrating the ground for the enforcement of its laws, but of identifying enemies and attacking them, the power of which was renewed by the ritual of investigation and the ceremony of public torture.\\"Discipline and Punish\\", p.57 (1977) Some unintended consequences were: * Providing a forum for the convict's body to become a focus of sympathy and admiration. * Redistributing blame: the executioner rather than the convict becomes the locus of shame. * Creating a site of conflict between the masses and the sovereign at the convict's body. Foucault notes that public executions often led to riots in support of the prisoner. Frustration for the inefficiency of this economy of power could be directed towards and coalesce around the site of torture and execution. Public torture and execution was a method the sovereign deployed to express his or her power, and it did so through the ritual of investigation and the ceremony of execution‚Äîthe reality and horror of which was supposed to express the omnipotence of the sovereign but actually revealed that the sovereign's power depended on the participation of the people. Torture was made public in order to create fear in the people, and to force them to participate in the method of control by agreeing with its verdicts. But problems arose in cases in which the people through their actions disagreed with the sovereign, by heroizing the victim (admiring the courage in facing death) or in moving to physically free the criminal or to redistribute the effects of the strategically deployed power. Thus, he argues, the public execution was ultimately an ineffective use of the body, qualified as non-economical. As well, it was applied non- uniformly and haphazardly. Hence, its political cost was too high. It was the antithesis of the more modern concerns of the state: order and generalization. So it had to be reformed to allow for greater stability of property for the bourgeoisie. Punishment Firstly, the switch to prison was not immediate and sudden. There was a more graded change, though it ran its course rapidly. Prison was preceded by a different form of public spectacle. The theater of public torture gave way to public chain gangs. Punishment became \\"gentle\\", though not for humanitarian reasons, Foucault suggests. He argues that reformists were unhappy with the unpredictable, unevenly distributed nature of the violence the sovereign would inflict on the convict. The sovereign's right to punish was so disproportionate that it was ineffective and uncontrolled. Reformists felt the power to punish and judge should become more evenly distributed, the state's power must be a form of public power. This, according to Foucault, was of more concern to reformists than humanitarian arguments. Out of this movement towards generalized punishment, a thousand \\"mini- theatres\\" of punishment would have been created wherein the convicts' bodies would have been put on display in a more ubiquitous, controlled, and effective spectacle. Prisoners would have been forced to do work that reflected their crime, thus repaying society for their infractions. This would have allowed the public to see the convicts' bodies enacting their punishment, and thus to reflect on the crime. But these experiments lasted less than twenty years. Foucault argues that this theory of \\"gentle\\" punishment represented the first step away from the excessive force of the sovereign, and towards more generalized and controlled means of punishment. But he suggests that the shift towards prison that followed was the result of a new \\"technology\\" and ontology for the body being developed in the 18th century, the \\"technology\\" of discipline, and the ontology of \\"man as machine.\\" Discipline The emergence of prison as the form of punishment for every crime grew out of the development of discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to Foucault. He looks at the development of highly refined forms of discipline, of discipline concerned with the smallest and most precise aspects of a person's body. Discipline, he suggests, developed a new economy and politics for bodies. Modern institutions required that bodies must be individuated according to their tasks, as well as for training, observation, and control. Therefore, he argues, discipline created a whole new form of individuality for bodies, which enabled them to perform their duty within the new forms of economic, political, and military organizations emerging in the modern age and continuing to today. The individuality that discipline constructs (for the bodies it controls) has four characteristics, namely it makes individuality which is: * Cellular--determining the spatial distribution of the bodies * Organic--ensuring that the activities required of the bodies are \\"natural\\" for them * Genetic--controlling the evolution over time of the activities of the bodies * Combinatory--allowing for the combination of the force of many bodies into a single massive force Foucault suggests this individuality can be implemented in systems that are officially egalitarian, but use discipline to construct non-egalitarian power relations: :Historically, the process by which the bourgeoisie became in the course of the eighteenth century the politically dominant class was masked by the establishment of an explicit, coded and formally egalitarian juridical framework, made possible by the organization of a parliamentary, representative regime. But the development and generalization of disciplinary mechanisms constituted the other, dark side of these processes. The general juridical form that guaranteed a system of rights that were egalitarian in principle was supported by these tiny, everyday, physical mechanisms, by all those systems of micro-power that are essentially non- egalitarian and asymmetrical that we call the disciplines. (222) Foucault's argument is that discipline creates \\"docile bodies\\", ideal for the new economics, politics and warfare of the modern industrial age - bodies that function in factories, ordered military regiments, and school classrooms. But, to construct docile bodies the disciplinary institutions must be able to constantly observe and record the bodies they control and ensure the internalization of the disciplinary individuality within the bodies being controlled. That is, discipline must come about without excessive force through careful observation, and molding of the bodies into the correct form through this observation. This requires a particular form of institution, exemplified, Foucault argues, by Jeremy Bentham's panopticon. This architectural model, though it was never adopted by architects according to Bentham's exact blueprint, becomes an important conceptualization of power relations for prison reformers of the 19th century, and its general principle is a recurring theme in modern prison construction. The panopticon was the ultimate realization of a modern disciplinary institution. It allowed for constant observation characterized by an \\"unequal gaze\\"; the constant possibility of observation. Perhaps the most important feature of the panopticon was that it was specifically designed so that the prisoner could never be sure whether they were being observed at any moment. The unequal gaze caused the internalization of disciplinary individuality, and the docile body required of its inmates. This means one is less likely to break rules or laws if they believe they are being watched, even if they are not. Thus, prisons, and specifically those that follow the model of the panopticon, provide the ideal form of modern punishment. Foucault argues that this is why the generalized, \\"gentle\\" punishment of public work gangs gave way to the prison. It was the ideal modernization of punishment, so its eventual dominance was natural. Having laid out the emergence of the prison as the dominant form of punishment, Foucault devotes the rest of the book to examining its precise form and function in society, laying bare the reasons for its continued use, and questioning the assumed results of its use. Prison In examining the construction of the prison as the central means of criminal punishment, Foucault builds a case for the idea that prison became part of a larger \\"carceral system\\" that has become an all-encompassing sovereign institution in modern society. Prison is one part of a vast network, including schools, military institutions, hospitals, and factories, which build a panoptic society for its members. This system creates \\"disciplinary careers\\"Discipline and Punish, p.300 (1977) for those locked within its corridors. It is operated under the scientific authority of medicine, psychology, and criminology. Moreover, it operates according to principles that ensure that it \\"cannot fail to produce delinquents.\\"Discipline and Punish, p.266 (1977) Delinquency, indeed, is produced when social petty crime (such as taking wood from the lord's lands) is no longer tolerated, creating a class of specialized \\"delinquents\\" acting as the police's proxy in surveillance of society. The structures Foucault chooses to use as his starting positions help highlight his conclusions. In particular, his choice as a perfect prison of the penal institution at Mettray helps personify the carceral system. Within it is included the Prison, the School, the Church, and the work-house (industry) - all of which feature heavily in his argument. The prisons at Neufchatel and Mettray were perfect examples for Foucault, because they, even in their original state, began to show the traits for which Foucault was searching. Moreover, they showed the body of knowledge being developed about the prisoners, the creation of the 'delinquent' class, and the disciplinary careers emerging.MODEL PRISONS - View Article - The New York Times 1873 Reception The historian Peter Gay described Discipline and Punish as the key text by Foucault that has influenced scholarship on the theory and practice of 19th century prisons. Though Gay wrote that Foucault \\"breathed fresh air into the history of penology and severely damaged, without wholly discrediting, traditional Whig optimism about the humanization of penitentiaries as one long success story\\", he nevertheless gave a negative assessment of Foucault's work, endorsing the critical view of Gordon Wright in his 1983 book Between the Guillotine and Liberty: Two Centuries of the Crime Problem in France. Gay concluded that Foucault and his followers overstate the extent to which keeping \\"the masses quiet\\" motivates those in power, thereby underestimating factors such as \\"contingency, complexity, the sheer anxiety or stupidity of power holders\\", or their authentic idealism. Law Professor David Garland wrote an explication and critique of Discipline and Punish. Towards the end, he sums up the main critiques that have been made. He states, \\"the major critical theme which emerges, and is independently made by many different critics, concerns Foucault's overestimation of the political dimension. Discipline and Punish consistently proposes an explanation in terms of power‚Äîsometimes in the absence of any supporting evidence‚Äîwhere other historians would see a need for other factors and considerations to be brought into account.\\"Garland, David (1986) Foucault's Discipline and Punish an exposition and Critique, American Bar Foundation Research Journal, 4 Another criticism leveled against Foucault's approach is that he often studies the discourse of \\"prisons\\" rather than their concrete practice; this is taken up by Fred Alford: > \\"Foucault has mistaken the idea of prison, as reflected in the discourse of > criminologists, for its practice. More precisely put, Foucault presents the > utopian ideals of eighteenth-century prison reformers, most of which were > never realized, as though they were the actual reforms of the eighteenth and > nineteenth centuries.

As of 2008, despite efforts to improve education, the country had the lowest adult literacy rate in the world (25.3%).. Palgrave Macmillan. 2007. Primary and secondary The Education Act makes schooling compulsory from age 6 to 16.\\"Burkina Faso\\". 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor . Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The official language for education is French. By law, education is free, but the government does not have adequate resources to provide universal free primary education. Children are required to pay for school supplies, and communities are frequently responsible for constructing primary school buildings and teachers‚Äô housing. Children from poor families can continue to receive tuition-free education through junior high and high school, if their grades qualify. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 46 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 36 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 1998, 26.5 percent of children ages 6 to 14 years were attending school. As of 2001, 66 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. School conditions are usually reasonable with very basic equipment. Legally the size limit for one class is 65 students, but in many rural areas classes are much bigger because of the lack of schools. If a school is full, children may get turned away and will have to try again the next year. There is an International School of Ouagadougou open to foreign nationals and Burkinab√®. School session A week runs from Monday to Saturday, with the schools closed on Thursday. Burkina Faso has a national curriculum. The subjects taught include Production, where children may learn to plant maize and trees or keep chickens, on school land. They have a break between noon and 3pm. Higher education University of Ouagadougou As of 2010 there were three main public universities in Burkina Faso: The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso, the University of Koudougou and the University of Ouagadougou. The first private higher education institution was established in 1992 and the Universit√© Libre de Ouagadougou began operations in 2000. The Universit√© Catholique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest opened its Burkina campus in Bobo-Dioulasso in 2000 with a food and agriculture speciality, and the Catholic in 2004 in Ouagadougou. Supervision rates are different from one university to another. At the University of Ouagadougou there is one lecturer for every 24 students, while at The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso they have one lecturer for every three students. Higher education provision is highly centralized in Ouagadougou. In 2010/2011 the University of Ouagadougou had around 40,000 students (83% of the national population of university students), the University of Koudougou had 5,600 students, and the Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso had 2,600.Government of France, MINISTERE DES AFFAIRES ETRANGERES ET EUROPEENNES, AMBASSADE DE FRANCE AU BURKINA FASO, FICHE BURKINA FASO (French) The private universities each had less than 1,000 students. The University of Ouagadougou closed its doors for two months in 2008, following student protests about working conditions and non-payment of their grants. One outcome was the creation of University of Ouagadougou II 20km away at Saaba, to relieve pressure on overcrowded facilities. It now teaches the law, politics, economics and management students formerly at the main campus and students receive University of Ouagadougou degrees. There are also online classes through the Institut de Formation Ouverte √† Distance (IFOAD). In 2014, University of Ouagadougou received funding from OPEC for new facilities. None of the country's universities are ranked in higher education listings like the Time Higher World Universities, probably because the language of instruction is french, lecturers do not have time for much research, there is reliance on international aid to support some aspects of public education, and class sizes at the main public university are large. Nonetheless, there are opportunities to study right through to doctoral level. Administration The University Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso are composed of five levels of decision making: the board of directors, the university assembly, the university council, institutions, and departments. Influencing factors * The number of actual schools (for primary) * A shortage of qualified instructors (for higher education) * Families have to pay for school supplies and school fees * Families have very low income * Sending a child (or children) to school limits the money being earned for the family * Many families are only able to send one child to school, leaving the others to earn money for the family. They usually send the oldest able male. * Language barrier. Education is mainly conducted in French, which only 15% of Burkinab√® can speak, rather than in first languages of the country.

Written by series co-creator Trey Parker, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 27, 2004, just before the 2004 presidential election. In the episode, PETA protested against the use of a cow as South Park Elementary's mascot. The student body holds an election to determine a new mascot. As the election approaches, Kyle tries to convince everyone that his candidate, a giant douche, is better than Cartman's nominee, a turd sandwich. Meanwhile, Stan ends up getting exiled from South Park after refusing to vote.  Plot  During a pep rally at South Park Elementary, a group of local PETA eco- terrorists protest the use of a cow as the school's mascot. The school agrees to pick a new mascot, and the students are told to vote for said new mascot. Embarrassed by the bland choices, the kids decide to fill in a joke candidate but disagree as to whether it should be a \\"giant douche\\" or a \\"turd sandwich\\". Kyle rallies his friends to fill in the giant douche, and Cartman gathers support for the turd sandwich. The result is that the two joke candidates get the most votes and the students must choose between the two in an election. Stan does not see the point in voting between a giant douche and a turd sandwich as they are exactly the same in his opinion, and declares that he will not vote at all, much to everyone's dismay. Stan is equally dismayed, wondering why anyone would care about such a pointless exercise. He talks about it with his parents at dinner, but his parents are not impressed with his apathy and even get into a fight over who should win when Stan explains who the two competitors are. This results in Kyle calling on Sean \\"Puff Daddy\\" Combs, who intimidates Stan with a literal Vote or Die campaign. Meanwhile, the campaign continues, with the turd sandwich supporters rallying against the giant douche supporters, using bribery and fear mongering to gain support. By the time of the election, Stan agrees to vote after being chased by Combs and his associates through the streets with guns. However, he realizes Kyle only wanted him to vote in order for giant douche to win when he votes turd sandwich and Kyle demands that he change his vote. Disgusted with this electoral process, Stan once again refuses to vote. The school administration decides that Stan must be banished from the town for all eternity or until he decides that voting is important. He is spat on by the townspeople and his shirt is ripped off piece by piece before being placed on a horse, bound with a bucket over his head, and send him off into the woods with Butters's father blowing a horn to signal the horse to escort Stan. Stan's horse randomly takes him to a PETA compound where he finds that PETA's members live with animals, practicing zoophilia and even interbreeding with them. Stan explains his banishment to the PETA, who tells him that an election \\"is always between a douche and a turd\\", because they are the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics. Combs shows up at the camp to kill Stan, but is distracted by a PETA member who throws a bucket of red paint on his fur coat. Combs and his posse retaliate by gunning down all the PETA members. The animals flee, and Stan manages to escape, only to suffer a minor injury on his arm. Returning to South Park, Stan is finally convinced to vote and chooses turd sandwich. Despite his vote, the giant douche still wins the vote, 1,410 to 36. Stan initially points out that his vote did not matter, but his parents inform their son that all votes matter even if it is for the losing side. Suddenly, Mr. Garrison runs in with the news that the PETA members have been discovered murdered. As a result, the cow is reinstated as South Park Elementary School's mascot. Randy tells Stan that now his vote did not matter, leaving an appalled expression on Stan as he went through so much for nothing.

It is issued by the National Research Council of Canada.NRC Website As a model code, it has no legal status until it is adopted by a jurisdiction that regulates construction. History The Constitution of Canada includes the regulation of building construction as a provincial responsibility. In a few cases, municipalities have been given the historic right of writing their own building code. In the early years of regulating building construction, this caused a patchwork of building codes across Canada. In 1941, the federal government of Canada published the first National Building Code. This was adopted by the various provinces and municipalities in Canada during the next 20 years. On 1 August 1947, the Division of Building Research, later named the Institute for Research in Construction (NRC-IRC) and today known as NRC Construction Research Centre, was established to provide a research service to the construction industry and to help ensure affordable and safe housing for a growing population of Canadians. Its founding head was Robert Legget. The new organization was also given the mandate to lead the development of the National Building Code of Canada. Since then, NRC's Construction Research Centre has grown to encompass emergent areas of research in support of the Canadian construction sector.archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: \\"NRC Institute for Research in Construction\\" Early photographs of activities are available in the archives.dr-dn.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: \\"Pictures: Division of Building Research\\" The Northern Research Program was housed at the Division of Building Research over the period from 1950 to 1986,cgs.ca: \\"Information and Location for Archival Records\\" and information gleaned from the Building Materials Section in York Redoubt made its way into the Code.collections.mun.ca: \\"National Research Council of Canada, Division of Building Research, Building Materials Section\\" Since 1960, there has been a revised document about every five years up to 1995. The 2000 edition of the building code was supposed to be an objective or performance-based building. However, this took considerably longer to write than foreseen and the next edition of the National Building Code of Canada was not published until 2005. The 2010 National Model Construction Codes was published on 29 November 2010.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: and the National Building Code of Canada 2010 incorporates energy efficiency requirements.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: \\"National Building Code of Canada 2010\\" The first National Farm Building Code of Canada (NFBC) was first published in 1960. The Model National Energy Codes for Buildings and Houses were first published in 1997. The Historical National Construction Codes on-line in PDF format is a single collection provided by the NRC of the English and French editions of all Code documents published between 1941 and 1998.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: \\"Historical Editions of the National Construction Codes (1941-1998)\\" On behalf of the Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes (CCBFC) the National Research Council (NRC) Canadian Codes Center publishes national model codes documents that set out minimum requirements relating to their scope and objectives.nrc- cnrc.gc.ca: \\"Canadian Codes Centre\\" These include the National Building Code, the National Fire Code, the National Plumbing Code, the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) and other documents. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) publishes other model codes that address electrical, gas and elevator systems. Requirements on the specification of structural wood products and wood building systems is set forth in the National Building Code which is concerned with health, safety, accessibility and the protection of buildings from fire or structural damage. The Code applies mainly to new construction, but also aspects of demolition, relocation, renovation and change of building use. The current NBCC was published in 2015, and is usually updated on a five-year cycle. The next update is expected in 2020.cwc.ca: \\"Building Code - Canada‚Äôs National Code System\\" Implementation The National Building Code is the model building code that forms the basis for all of the provincial building codes. Some jurisdictions create their own code based on the National Building Code, other jurisdictions have adopted the National Building often with supplementary laws or regulations to the requirements in the National Building Code. Alberta By agreement with the National Research Council of Canada,National Research Council of Canada Alberta is committed to using the National Building Code of Canada as its base document with changes and modifications to suit Alberta needs in regulating the design, construction, alteration, change of use and demolition of buildings. The Alberta Building Code 2006 was established by the Building Technical Council, a technical council of the Safety Codes Council,safetycodes.ab.ca: \\"Safety Codes Council\\" after consultation with municipal authorities, provincial government departments, associations, other affected parties and Code users. The Code is published for Alberta by the National Research Council of Canada. The Alberta Building Code 2006education.gov.ab.ca: was adopted by provincial regulation on 2 September 2007.qp.gov.ab.ca: \\"Alberta.ca > Service Alberta > Queen's Printer\\" The Alberta Building Code 2006 is developed and administered by Alberta Municipal and Public Affairs.Alberta.ca Municipal Affairs In addition to the production of the Alberta Building Code, Municipal Affairs is responsible for the development and dissemination of code interpretations and alternatives known as STANDATAmunicipalaffairs.alberta.ca: \\"Building STANDATA\\" which come in three forms: #Building Code Variances - acceptable alternative solutions to the prescriptive requirements (known as Alternative Solutions) in Division B. #Building Code Interpretations - interpretations on Code items #Building Code Bulletins - additional explanatory information on Code items or general Code topics British Columbia The British Columbia Building Codebccodes.ca: \\"BC Building Code 2012\\" is based on the core concepts of the National Building Code with some variations specific to the province.

The introduction of a provincial Building Code Act and a provincial Building Code addressed this problem by providing for uniform construction standards across Ontario.mah.gov.on.ca: \\"About Ontario‚Äôs Building Code\\" As of Jan. 1, 2012 the benchmark requirements for energy efficiency regarding houses and large buildings was enhanced.CodeNews Issue No. 201 Updated compliance paths for energy efficiency requirements in large buildings are set out in Supplementary Standard SB-10.Supplementary Standard SB-10 Residential buildings intended for occupancy on a continuing basis during the winter months must meet the performance levels specified in Supplementary Standard SB-12.mah.gov.on.ca: \\"Supplementary Standard SB-12\\" As of July 1, 2012 the Ontario Building Code was amended to address the issue of balcony glass breaking on newly constructed buildings.mah.gov.on.ca: \\"CodeNews Issue No. 204 - Glass Guards\\" The new amendment, Supplementary Standard SB-13, \\"Glass in Guards\\"mah.gov.on.ca: \\"Supplementary Standard SB-13, 'Glass in Guards'\\" is intended to help minimize the likelihood that balcony glass will break on newly constructed buildings and help reduce the chance of broken pieces falling to the ground below if balcony glass does break. Quebec The Building Act provides for the adoption of a Construction Code and a Safety Code for buildings, equipment intended for use by the public, and electric, plumbing, and pressure installations as well as installations intended to use, store, or distribute gas. Whereas the Construction Code applies to plan and estimate designers (architects, engineers, technologists) and contractors, the Safety Code is intended for owners of buildings, equipment, and facilities. These two codes are adopted chapter by chapter and are progressively replacing the seven laws and thirty-odd regulations that were previously in effect. The goal of this process is, obviously, to simplify regulations, but also to better define the responsibilities of owners and construction professionals. In force since November 7, 2000. The Code de construction du Qu√©becrbq.gouv.qc.ca: \\"Construction Code and Safety Code\\" Consisting of the National Construction Code ‚Äì 2005, amended and includes Part 10 for existing buildings. The Quebec Code de Construction is not compulsory in the province. Municipalities have the option of adopting the code of their choice, with or without modifications. In fact, many municipalities do not have any building code officially in effect. For example, since 2013 the R√©gie du b√¢timent du Qu√©bec has adopted a new code (Bill 122) that requires all owners of buildings that are 5 storeys and higher which are older than 1958 to conduct a facade inspection of the building by an engineer. This code is exclusive to the province. Other provinces Prince Edward Island,gov.pe.ca: \\"CHAPTER P-24 - PROVINCIAL BUILDING CODE ACT\\" Nova Scotia,gov.ns.ca: dead link and Newfoundland and Labrador\\"CONSOLIDATED NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR REGULATION 1140/96\\" have legislation enforcing the current version of the National Building Code of Canada. Manitoba,\\"The Buildings and Mobile Homes Act\\" New Brunswick,\\"NEW BRUNSWICK REGULATION 2002-45\\" and Saskatchewansboa.sk.ca: \\"About SBOA\\" have adopted the 2010 National Building Code as regulations under provincial acts. Federal jurisdiction For most construction under federal jurisdiction the National Building Code of Canada is the applicable Code. Property under federal jurisdiction includes military bases, federal government land and airports. First Nations land (as defined by the Indian Act - land set aside for the exclusive use of First Nations) may choose to adopt the National Building & Fire Codes through a Band Resolution or By Law, however the National Building and Fire codes are not legally enforceable. Content The intent of the Building Code is to detail the minimum provisions acceptable to maintain the safety of buildings, with specific regard to public health, fire protection, accessibility and structural sufficiency. It is not a textbook for building design. The Building Code concerns construction, renovation, and demolition. It also covers change of use projects where the change would result in increased hazard and/or maintenance and operation in the existing building. The Code sets out technical requirements for the aforementioned project types and does not pertain to existing buildings. The 1995 National Building Code is split into 9 parts. *Part 1 Scope and Definitions *Part 2 General Requirements *Part 3 Fire Protection, Occupant Safety and Accessibility *Part 4 Structural Design *Part 5 Environmental Separation *Part 6 Heating, Ventilating and Air-conditioning *Part 7 Plumbing Services *Part 8 Safety Measures at Construction and Demolition Sites *Part 9 Housing and Small Buildings Part 1 gives the definitions and describes how the building code is applied. Houses and certain other small buildings (less than 3 storeys high and 600 m2) are considered \\"Part 9 Buildings\\" and Part 9 drives the majority of the code requirements, with references to other parts where the scope of Part 9 is exceeded. Larger buildings are considered \\"Part 3 buildings\\" and parts 1 through 8 apply. Part 3 is the largest and most complicated part of the building code. It is intended to be used by engineers and architects. Part 9 is very prescriptive and is intended to be able to be applied by contractors. The building code also references hundreds of other construction documents that are legally incorporated by reference and thus part of the enforceable code. This includes many design, material testing, installation and commissioning documents that are produced by a number of private organizations. Most prominent among these are the Canadian Electrical Code, Underwriters Laboratories of CanadaUnderwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC) a subsidiary of Underwriters Laboratories, documents on fire alarm design, and a number of National Fire Protection Association documents.

Copper-clad steel (CCS), also known as copper-covered steel or the trademarked name Copperweld is a bi- metallic product, mainly used in the wire industry that combines the high mechanical resistance of steel with the conductivity and corrosion resistance of copper. It is mainly used for grounding purposes, line tracing to locate underground utilities, drop wire of telephone cables, and inner conductor of coaxial cables, including thin hookup cables like RG-174 and CATV cable. It is also used in some antennas for RF conducting wires. History The first recorded attempt to make copper clad steel wire took place in the early 1860s.Copper Clad Handbook, issued by the Duplex Metals Co., Chester, Pennsylvania, at the turn of the 20th century Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electroplating copper on steel. The Duplex Metals Co. traces its beginning to John Ferreol Monnot between 1900 and 1905. He had been very interested in the work of Mr. Martin in Paris. :\\"After several years devoted to experimenting, organized the Duplex Metals Company. Prior to his discovery of the process under which this company operates in producing its copper clad, probably almost every other possible way of welding copper and steel together had been tried by Mr. Monnot, but found useless for the purpose.\\" Uses Copper-clad steel wire find applications in grounding, connection of ground rods to metallic structures, ground grid meshes, substations, power installations, and lightning arrestors. This wire is also sometimes used for power transmission. Copper coated welding wire has become common since wire welding equipment has become popular. Copper-clad steel is occasionally used for making durable radio antennas, where its HF conductivity is nearly identical to a same-diameter solid copper conductor. It is most often used in antennas with long spans of unsupported wire, which need extra strength to withstand high tension which would cause solid copper or aluminum wire to break or stretch excessively. Properties The main properties of these conductors include: * Good corrosion resistance of copper * High tensile strength of steel * Resistance against material fatigue Advantages Since the outer conductor layer is low-impedance copper, and only the center is higher impedance steel, the skin effect gives RF transmission lines with heavy copper-cladding a low impedance at high frequencies, equivalent to that of a solid copper wire. Tensile strength of copper-clad steel conductors is greater than that of ordinary copper conductors permitting greater span lengths than with copper. Another advantage is that smaller diameter copper-clad steel conductors may be used in coaxial cables, permitting higher impedance and smaller cable diameter than with copper conductors of similar strength. Due to the inseparable union of the two metals, it deters theft since copper recovery is impractical and thus has very little scrap value. Installations with copper-clad steel conductors are generally accepted as fulfilling the legal specifications for a good electrical ground. For this reason its use is preferred by industrial companies and utilities when cost is a concern.

As well as having applications to group theory, modular representations arise naturally in other branches of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, coding theory, combinatorics and number theory. Within finite group theory, character-theoretic results proved by Richard Brauer using modular representation theory played an important role in early progress towards the classification of finite simple groups, especially for simple groups whose characterization was not amenable to purely group-theoretic methods because their Sylow 2-subgroups were too small in an appropriate sense. Also, a general result on embedding of elements of order 2 in finite groups called the Z* theorem, proved by George Glauberman using the theory developed by Brauer, was particularly useful in the classification program. If the characteristic p of K does not divide the order |G|, then modular representations are completely reducible, as with ordinary (characteristic 0) representations, by virtue of Maschke's theorem. In the other case, when |G‚â° 0 mod p, the process of averaging over the group needed to prove Maschke's theorem breaks down, and representations need not be completely reducible. Much of the discussion below implicitly assumes that the field K is sufficiently large (for example, K algebraically closed suffices), otherwise some statements need refinement. History The earliest work on representation theory over finite fields is by who showed that when p does not divide the order of the group, the representation theory is similar to that in characteristic 0. He also investigated modular invariants of some finite groups. The systematic study of modular representations, when the characteristic p divides the order of the group, was started by and was continued by him for the next few decades.  Example  Finding a representation of the cyclic group of two elements over F2 is equivalent to the problem of finding matrices whose square is the identity matrix. Over every field of characteristic other than 2, there is always a basis such that the matrix can be written as a diagonal matrix with only 1 or ‚àí1 occurring on the diagonal, such as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Over F2, there are many other possible matrices, such as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, the representation theory of a finite cyclic group is fully explained by the theory of the Jordan normal form. Non-diagonal Jordan forms occur when the characteristic divides the order of the group.  Ring theory interpretation  Given a field K and a finite group G, the group algebra K[G] (which is the K-vector space with K-basis consisting of the elements of G, endowed with algebra multiplication by extending the multiplication of G by linearity) is an Artinian ring. When the order of G is divisible by the characteristic of K, the group algebra is not semisimple, hence has non-zero Jacobson radical. In that case, there are finite- dimensional modules for the group algebra that are not projective modules. By contrast, in the characteristic 0 case every irreducible representation is a direct summand of the regular representation, hence is projective. Brauer characters Modular representation theory was developed by Richard Brauer from about 1940 onwards to study in greater depth the relationships between the characteristic p representation theory, ordinary character theory and structure of G, especially as the latter relates to the embedding of, and relationships between, its p-subgroups. Such results can be applied in group theory to problems not directly phrased in terms of representations. Brauer introduced the notion now known as the Brauer character. When K is algebraically closed of positive characteristic p, there is a bijection between roots of unity in K and complex roots of unity of order prime to p. Once a choice of such a bijection is fixed, the Brauer character of a representation assigns to each group element of order coprime to p the sum of complex roots of unity corresponding to the eigenvalues (including multiplicities) of that element in the given representation. The Brauer character of a representation determines its composition factors but not, in general, its equivalence type. The irreducible Brauer characters are those afforded by the simple modules. These are integral (though not necessarily non-negative) combinations of the restrictions to elements of order coprime to p of the ordinary irreducible characters. Conversely, the restriction to the elements of order coprime to p of each ordinary irreducible character is uniquely expressible as a non-negative integer combination of irreducible Brauer characters. Reduction (mod p) In the theory initially developed by Brauer, the link between ordinary representation theory and modular representation theory is best exemplified by considering the group algebra of the group G over a complete discrete valuation ring R with residue field K of positive characteristic p and field of fractions F of characteristic 0, such as the p-adic integers. The structure of R[G] is closely related both to the structure of the group algebra K[G] and to the structure of the semisimple group algebra F[G], and there is much interplay between the module theory of the three algebras. Each R[G]-module naturally gives rise to an F[G]-module, and, by a process often known informally as reduction (mod p), to a K[G]-module. On the other hand, since R is a principal ideal domain, each finite-dimensional F[G]-module arises by extension of scalars from an R[G]-module. In general, however, not all K[G]-modules arise as reductions (mod p) of R[G]-modules. Those that do are liftable.  Number of simple modules  In ordinary representation theory, the number of simple modules k(G) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of G. In the modular case, the number l(G) of simple modules is equal to the number of conjugacy classes whose elements have order coprime to the relevant prime p, the so-called p-regular classes.  Blocks and the structure of the group algebra  In modular representation theory, while Maschke's theorem does not hold when the characteristic divides the group order, the group algebra may be decomposed as the direct sum of a maximal collection of two-sided ideals known as blocks. When the field F has characteristic 0, or characteristic coprime to the group order, there is still such a decomposition of the group algebra F[G] as a sum of blocks (one for each isomorphism type of simple module), but the situation is relatively transparent when F is sufficiently large: each block is a full matrix algebra over F, the endomorphism ring of the vector space underlying the associated simple module. To obtain the blocks, the identity element of the group G is decomposed as a sum of primitive idempotents in Z(R[G]), the center of the group algebra over the maximal order R of F. The block corresponding to the primitive idempotent e is the two-sided ideal e R[G]. For each indecomposable R[G]-module, there is only one such primitive idempotent that does not annihilate it, and the module is said to belong to (or to be in) the corresponding block (in which case, all its composition factors also belong to that block). In particular, each simple module belongs to a unique block. Each ordinary irreducible character may also be assigned to a unique block according to its decomposition as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters. The block containing the trivial module is known as the principal block.  Projective modules  In ordinary representation theory, every indecomposable module is irreducible, and so every module is projective. However, the simple modules with characteristic dividing the group order are rarely projective. Indeed, if a simple module is projective, then it is the only simple module in its block, which is then isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of the underlying vector space, a full matrix algebra. In that case, the block is said to have 'defect 0'. Generally, the structure of projective modules is difficult to determine. For the group algebra of a finite group, the (isomorphism types of) projective indecomposable modules are in a one-to- one correspondence with the (isomorphism types of) simple modules: the socle of each projective indecomposable is simple (and isomorphic to the top), and this affords the bijection, as non-isomorphic projective indecomposables have non-isomorphic socles. The multiplicity of a projective indecomposable module as a summand of the group algebra (viewed as the regular module) is the dimension of its socle (for large enough fields of characteristic zero, this recovers the fact that each simple module occurs with multiplicity equal to its dimension as a direct summand of the regular module). Each projective indecomposable module (and hence each projective module) in positive characteristic p may be lifted to a module in characteristic 0. Using the ring R as above, with residue field K, the identity element of G may be decomposed as a sum of mutually orthogonal primitive idempotents (not necessarily central) of K[G]. Each projective indecomposable K[G]-module is isomorphic to e.K[G] for a primitive idempotent e that occurs in this decomposition. The idempotent e lifts to a primitive idempotent, say E, of R[G], and the left module E.R[G] has reduction (mod p) isomorphic to e.K[G]. Some orthogonality relations for Brauer characters When a projective module is lifted, the associated character vanishes on all elements of order divisible by p, and (with consistent choice of roots of unity), agrees with the Brauer character of the original characteristic p module on p-regular elements. The (usual character-ring) inner product of the Brauer character of a projective indecomposable with any other Brauer character can thus be defined: this is 0 if the second Brauer character is that of the socle of a non-isomorphic projective indecomposable, and 1 if the second Brauer character is that of its own socle. The multiplicity of an ordinary irreducible character in the character of the lift of a projective indecomposable is equal to the number of occurrences of the Brauer character of the socle of the projective indecomposable when the restriction of the ordinary character to p-regular elements is expressed as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters. Decomposition matrix and Cartan matrix The composition factors of the projective indecomposable modules may be calculated as follows: Given the ordinary irreducible and irreducible Brauer characters of a particular finite group, the irreducible ordinary characters may be decomposed as non-negative integer combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters. The integers involved can be placed in a matrix, with the ordinary irreducible characters assigned rows and the irreducible Brauer characters assigned columns. This is referred to as the decomposition matrix, and is frequently labelled D. It is customary to place the trivial ordinary and Brauer characters in the first row and column respectively. The product of the transpose of D with D itself results in the Cartan matrix, usually denoted C; this is a symmetric matrix such that the entries in its j-th row are the multiplicities of the respective simple modules as composition factors of the j-th projective indecomposable module. The Cartan matrix is non-singular; in fact, its determinant is a power of the characteristic of K. Since a projective indecomposable module in a given block has all its composition factors in that same block, each block has its own Cartan matrix.  Defect groups  To each block B of the group algebra K[G], Brauer associated a certain p-subgroup, known as its defect group (where p is the characteristic of K). Formally, it is the largest p-subgroup D of G for which there is a Brauer correspondent of B for the subgroup DC_G(D), where C_G(D) is the centralizer of D in G. The defect group of a block is unique up to conjugacy and has a strong influence on the structure of the block. For example, if the defect group is trivial, then the block contains just one simple module, just one ordinary character, the ordinary and Brauer irreducible characters agree on elements of order prime to the relevant characteristic p, and the simple module is projective. At the other extreme, when K has characteristic p, the Sylow p-subgroup of the finite group G is a defect group for the principal block of K[G]. The order of the defect group of a block has many arithmetical characterizations related to representation theory. It is the largest invariant factor of the Cartan matrix of the block, and occurs with multiplicity one. Also, the power of p dividing the index of the defect group of a block is the greatest common divisor of the powers of p dividing the dimensions of the simple modules in that block, and this coincides with the greatest common divisor of the powers of p dividing the degrees of the ordinary irreducible characters in that block. Other relationships between the defect group of a block and character theory include Brauer's result that if no conjugate of the p-part of a group element g is in the defect group of a given block, then each irreducible character in that block vanishes at g. This is one of many consequences of Brauer's second main theorem. The defect group of a block also has several characterizations in the more module-theoretic approach to block theory, building on the work of J. A. Green, which associates a p-subgroup known as the vertex to an indecomposable module, defined in terms of relative projectivity of the module. For example, the vertex of each indecomposable module in a block is contained (up to conjugacy) in the defect group of the block, and no proper subgroup of the defect group has that property. Brauer's first main theorem states that the number of blocks of a finite group that have a given p-subgroup as defect group is the same as the corresponding number for the normalizer in the group of that p-subgroup. The easiest block structure to analyse with non-trivial defect group is when the latter is cyclic. Then there are only finitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block, and the structure of the block is by now well understood, by virtue of work of Brauer, E.C. Dade, J.A. Green and J.G. Thompson, among others. In all other cases, there are infinitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block. Blocks whose defect groups are not cyclic can be divided into two types: tame and wild. The tame blocks (which only occur for the prime 2) have as a defect group a dihedral group, semidihedral group or (generalized) quaternion group, and their structure has been broadly determined in a series of papers by Karin Erdmann. The indecomposable modules in wild blocks are extremely difficult to classify, even in principle.

Pennant Hills is located 20 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. West Pennant Hills is a separate suburb to the West of Pennant Hills and is part of the Hills District. History The area was first explored by Governor Arthur Phillip shortly after 15 April 1788. It was noted that the party saw 'fine views of the mountains inland' (the Blue Mountains). Governor Phillip 'did not doubt that a large river would be found' nearby. The first white settlement occurred in the area with the establishment of convict timber camps in the time of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Permanent white settlement of Pennant Hills began only in the 1840s and took off with the arrival of the Northern railway line in the 1880s. In August 1912 the federal government opened a Wireless Telegraphy Station, the first of its kind on a national level.Crowley, Frank (1974), A New History of Australia, William Heinemann, Melbourne, Victoria, p. 301 The suburb has grown considerably since the 1950s, when the motor car became commonplace. There are two theories about the origin of the suburb's name. One is that the name comes from a hill where a pennant was flown as a signal during the early days of New South Wales. However, though such signals were certainly used, there is no evidence that such a pennant was ever flown at what is now Pennant Hills, but in the early 19th century the name applied to the whole ridge down as far as Mobbs Hill, which has a Telegraph Road to commemorate the signalling station. Also, references to the suburb of Pennant Hills were written 20 years before the establishment of pennant stations (Patrick 1994:79‚Äì80). Elizabeth MacArthur records receiving a flag signal at Parramatta that her husband John had returned from England in 1806. The other theory says that Pennant Hills was named after an 18th-century botanist, Thomas Pennant (Patrick 1994:79‚Äì80), though there is no contemporary evidence for this either. The fact that the area was first referred to as \\"Pendant Hills\\" in the Sydney Gazette when first published in 1803 makes this theory unlikely, as there was no Thomas Pendant either. The name Pennant Hills originally applied to the area now known as West Pennant Hills, located in the Hills District. However, when the northern railway line was built it passed through what is now Pennant Hills, so a suburb grew around the station and took on the name. The area around Thompsons Corner was renamed West Pennant Hills. Pennant Hills is hilly and the highest altitude is at Observatory Park on Pennant Hills Road, which once was the site of the old astronomical observatory. During the 1960s and 1970s, Pennant Hills was the site of Chelmsford Private Hospital, where the unorthodox psychiatric Deep Sleep Therapy conducted by Dr Harry Bailey resulted in the deaths of dozens of patients. Commercial areas Pennant Hills is one of the major commercial centres of Hornsby Shire. Several dozen shops are located at the north-west of the railway line, along with the local Pennant Hills Library. Several restaurants and cafes are located around Yarrara Road. Pennant Hills Marketplace, a local shopping centre, is located along Hillcrest Road. Residential houses are found in all areas in Pennant Hills, with recent modern apartments and office towers found along Pennant Hills Road. A significant commercial/industrial area can be found along Pennant Hills Road. Pennant Hills is home to several entertainment venues including the Pennant Hills Hotel. Transport Pennant Hills train station on 10 December 2015, showing construction of the third track as part of the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor. Pennant Hills railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. Pennant Hills Road is one of Sydney's major thoroughfares. Bus services by Transdev NSW and Hillsbus have their terminus in Pennant Hills and run to West Pennant Hills, Castle Hill and Cherrybrook. Churches Pennant Hills was established as a Catholic parish in 1928 and a number of Catholic churches have been built since then. The parish's current church, St. Agatha's, was built in 1979. St Mark's Anglican Church, Pennant Hills Baptist Church and a Pennant Hills Uniting Church also serve Pennant Hills. Thornleigh Seventh-day Adventist Church is located in Pennant Hills. Pennant Hills is also home to the first Danish Church in Australia. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark made an official visit there on 6 March 2005. Schools Pennant Hills has two public schools: Pennant Hills Public School established in 1925 and Pennant Hills High School established in 1966, and two Catholic schools, Mount St Benedict College a girls secondary school and St. Agatha's Catholic Primary School. Sport and recreation  Parks and reserves  Pennant Hills is surrounded on two sides by large swathes of bushland. To the east, the suburb is bordered by the upper reaches of the Lane Cove River and its associated national park, whilst in the north-west, Pennant Hills borders Berowra Valley National Park. Both of these reserves contain extensive walking tracks within the boundaries of the suburb, with some linking to the Great North Walk. Pennant Hills also contains many public parks, the largest being the Pennant Hills Park sportsground. This complex hosts many sporting facilities consisting of the Ern Holmes Oval for Australian Football and cricket, tennis and netball courts, a rugby union field, a football pitch, two hockey fields and an archery range. The Ern Holmes Oval was the home ground of the Pennant Hills Demons Australian Football Club until 2011. The Lilian Fraser Garden is also located in Pennant Hills. Originally maintained for many years by the noted government biologist Dr Lilian Fraser, after her death in 1987 her collection of rare and exotic plants was passed on to Hornsby Shire Council. Open free of charge to the public for viewing, the garden can also be hired for special events for a fee.  Sport and leisure  Pennant Hills, due to its wide array of sporting facilities, plays home to a large number of sporting organisations. These organisations include the Pennant Hills Football Club, which was established in 1957, and the Pennant Hills Demons AFC, which has seen nine players go on to compete in the AFL. Although the Ern Holmes Oval is no longer the home ground of the Demons premiership team due to its size, many of the club's junior teams still compete in Pennant Hills. Pennant Hills is also home to the Baden Powell Scout Centre, which borders the Lane Cove National Park. Opened in 1929, it initially served as a permanent camp for the unemployed during the Great Depression, and was visited by the Lord Baden-Powell himself in 1931. Situated on 36 acres of bushland, the centre is now home to the John Hill training centre and provides accommodation, catering and conference facilities for large groups, as well as activities such as high-ropes and rock climbing for camps. The Pennant Hills area is home to the Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Rugby League Club affectionately known as the Stags. Whilst originally based at Pennant Hills Park the club now plays out of Greenway Oval at Cherrybrook. The club competes with distinction in the North Sydney District Junior Rugby League competition.

It is produced by the pancreas and found in pancreatic juice, along with amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsinogen. It is cleaved to its active form, trypsin, by enteropeptidase, which is found in the intestinal mucosa. Once activated, the trypsin can cleave more trypsinogen into trypsin, a process called autoactivation. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine. Function Trypsinogen is the proenzyme precursor of trypsin. Trypsinogen (the inactive form) is stored in the pancreas so that it may be released when required for protein digestion. The pancreas stores the inactive form trypsinogen because the active trypsin would cause severe damage to the tissue of the pancreas. Trypsinogen is released by the pancreas into the second part of the duodenum, via the pancreatic duct, along with other digestive enzymes. Activation of trypsinogen Trypsinogen is activated by enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase). Enteropeptidase is produced by the mucosa of duodenum and it cleaves the peptide bond of trypsinogen after residue 15, which is a lysine. The N-terminal peptide is discarded, and a slight rearrangement of the folded protein occurs. The newly formed N-terminal residue (residue 16) inserts into a cleft, where its Œ±-amino group forms an ion pair with the aspartate near the active site serine, and results in the conformational rearrangement of other residues. The amino group of Gly 193 orientates itself into the correct position, which completes the oxyanion hole in active site, thereby activating the protein. Since trypsin also cleaves the peptide bond after an arginine or a lysine, it can cleave other trypsinogen, and the activation process therefore becomes autocatalytic. Safeguards against trypsinogen activation Trypsin is produced, stored and released as the inactive trypsinogen to ensure that the protein is only activated in the appropriate location. Premature trypsin activation can be destructive and may trigger a series of events that lead to pancreatic self-digestion. In normal pancreas, around 5% of trypsinogens are thought to get activated, therefore there are a number of defenses against such inappropriate activation. Trypsinogen is stored in intracellular vesicles in the pancreas called zymogen granules whose membranous walls are thought to be resistant to enzymatic degradation. A further safeguard against inappropriate trypsin activation is the presence of inhibitors such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1), which binds to any trypsin formed. Trypsin autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen is also a slow process due to the presence of a large negative charge on the conserved N-terminal hexapeptide of trypsinogen, which repels the aspartate on the back of trypsin's specificity pocket. Trypsin may also inactivate other trypsin by cleavage. Serum trypsinogen Serum trypsinogen is measured using a blood test. High levels are seen in acute pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis. Trypsinogen isoforms Three isoforms of trypsinogens may be found in human pancreatic juice. These are the cationic, anionic, and meso trypsinogen, and they account for 23.1%, 16%, and 0.5% of total pancreatic secretory proteins, respectively. Other forms of trypsinogen have been found in other organisms. Diseases The inappropriate activation of trypsinogen in the pancreas can lead to pancreatitis. Some type of pancreatitis may be associated with mutant forms of trypsinogen. A mutation at Arg 117, a trypsin-sensitive site, in cationic trypsinogen has been implicated in hereditary pancreatitis, a rare form of early-onset genetic disorder. Arg 117 may be a fail-safe mechanism by which trypsin, when activated within the pancreas, may become inactivated, and loss of this cleavage site would result in a loss of control and permit autodigestion resulting in pancreatitis. Other mutations have also been found that are linked to pancreatitis.

Design and development Designed by Robert Thelen based on his 1913 Albatros B.I, the B.II was the aircraft that brought the aircraft manufacturer Albatros Flugzeugwerke to the world's attention (Ernst Heinkel claimed to have designed this aircraft, what is considered untrue by aviation historians).Grosz, Peter M. Albatros C.I, Windsock Datafile No. 57, Albatros Productions, 1996, , p.5, 10 The B.II had a shorter wingspan than the B.I and used a variety of engines up to 89 kW (120 hp). In 1914 it set an altitude record of 4,500 m (14,800 ft). The seating arrangement was not ideal; the pilot occupied the rear cockpit, the observer sat in front over the wings which greatly reduced his downward view while the protruding engine block almost completely obscured the view over the nose. When Albatros developed the armed C.I based on their B-series, the seat positions were swapped so that the observer/gunner had a better view and clear field of fire. A floatplane variant of the B.II was developed, known as the W.1 or B.II-W, as was a purpose-built trainer with increased wingspan and different engines, designated the B.IIa. Further developments led to the Albatros B.III, which was produced in small numbers. Operational history First flying in 1914, large numbers of the B.II were built and, though it was relegated from front-line service in 1915 following the introduction of the armed C-type two-seaters, the B.II remained in service as a trainer until 1918 and was still operated by the Swedish Air Force in 1919 and by the Polish Air Force during the Polish-Soviet war of 1920. A B.II from Feldflieger Abteilung 41 was the one of the first landplanes (as opposed to Zeppelin) to drop bombs on England that caused some damage; on April 16 1915, ten bombs were dropped by hand in the area of Sittingbourne and Faversham. No significant damage or casualties resulted. Service in Sweden In 1914, the German manufacturer Albatros-Flugzeugwerke GmbH of Berlin-Johannisthal, was touring several countries in northern Europe, displaying their new aircraft, the Albatros B.IIa. At the time, it was considered one of the best primary trainer aircraft. However, the landing gear and propeller were damaged when it arrived in Sweden. Due to the outbreak of World War I, no spares could be sent, and the aircraft was interned. It was repaired and used as a trainer by the Swedish Air Force. This aircraft was later copied and manufactured in Sweden by six different aircraft companies: Svenska Aeroplanfabriken (SAF), S√∂dertelge Werkst√§der (SW), Marinens Flygv√§sende (MFV), Nordiska Aviatikbolaget (NAB), AB Thulinverken as the Thulin C and Flygkompaniets Verkst√§der Malmen (FVM). It was the first military trainer aircraft in Sweden and received the designation Sk 1 and √ñ2 in the Swedish Air Force (the two types differed slightly, mainly by choice of engine). An FVM-built Sk 1 Albatros is on public display in the Swedish Air Force Museum near Link√∂ping. The type was used until 1935. One aircraft was later sold to Finland. Service in Finland NAB Albatros Type 9 (and SW 20 Albatros), Type 12 and Type 17 were among the first aircraft of the Finnish Air Force. It was in use between 1918 and 1923. There were two Type 9s, and one each of the Type 12 and 17. There was also one SW 20 Albatros, which was similar to the Type 9. The Type 12 aircraft was destroyed in the ferry flight to Finland; the remains of the aircraft were found near Ecker√∂, √Öland. Type 12 was actually a modified Curtiss Twin JN with floats made by NAB. Austro- Hungarian service The Albatros B.II was widely used by the K.u.K, but was given the designation Albatros B.I (series 21).

Thornleigh is located 22 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. The source of the Lane Cove River is located in Thornleigh. Geography Thornleigh is bounded to the north by Waitara Creek and south by the Lane Cove National Park. Thornleigh borders the suburbs of Normanhurst, Hornsby, Wahroonga, Westleigh and Pennant Hills. Thornleigh offers great district views and the topography varies greatly with many established areas built around bushland settings and into the hills to afford the great views. The northern areas of the suburb bounded by Larool Creek and Waitara Creek are leafy and lush with vegetation and native fauna including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, cockatoos, and bush turkeys. Majorie Headen Lookout is a vantage point which overlooks Larool and Waitara Creek Valley. The area bounded near the train station and the Comenarra Parkway include early examples of Federation and Californian Bungalow style properties. History Thornleigh was originally part of the land that the Kuringai people settled. The first non indigenous people to explore the area of Thornleigh were a party led by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1788. Settlers moved into the area in the 1830s and among them were James Milson, Patrick Duffy, John Thorn and Samuel Horne. Thornleigh is named after Constable John Thorn, who, along with Constable Horne, captured bushrangers Dalton and John MacNamara, leader of the North Rocks gang, on 22 June 1830, and were granted land as a reward in 1838. Horne's land became Hornsby (now Normanhurst), and Thorn's land became Thornleigh.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 255 Orcharding was one of the major mainstays of Thornleigh during the late nineteenth century. Land sales posters used this as an attraction for prospective settlers describing the area as \\"beautifully situated (and) surrounded by magnificent orchards, the fruit from which affords a splendid proof of the ferlility of the soil and mildness of the climate\\". Among the orchard growers was Patrick Michael Duffy, after which Duffy Avenue was named. After Patrick Duffy‚Äôs passing, his land was subdivided and passed down to his son Patrick Duffy Jnr. Eventually part of this land was purchased by the wealthy Friend family who built the Windyhaugh property on Duffy Avenue, which was later used as the first Presbyterian Fellowship Union camp in the Commonwealth.http://nswaol.library.usyd.edu.au/data/pdfs/13559_ID_Thorp1996WindyhaughPFUSiteThornleighHrtgRpt.pdf As part of the construction of the railway from Strathfield to Hornsby, a 1.2km branch was constructed in 1884 by the contractors to a quarry in a gully west of Thornleigh. The tracks included a zig zag section. Thornleigh railway station opened on 17 September 1886 where the local produce (mainly citrus fruits) was exported to the city markets. Fruit grown at Thornleigh was also being exported as far as Vancouver and San Francisco. Thornleigh Post Office opened on 12 March 1888. The Thornleigh School of Arts opened in 1890 and was demolished in 1980 along with many other locations of historical significance in the suburb throughout the commercial development of the area in the 1970s and 1980s. These include the Astra Theatre (Originally named the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1923), the Royal Hotel, Thornleigh Public School with its World War I memorial and the original Edwardian structures at Thornleigh Railway Station. The Thornleigh Community Centre was constructed by the local and state government in order to compensate the community for the demolition of the Thornleigh School of Arts. In 1901, the National Brickworks started operations at Thornleigh. In 1913, the largest malt works in the southern hemisphere was established by WG Chilvers. Chilvers Road was named after William George Chilvers. Other streets with notable names include Norman Avenue, named after the Australian engineer Norman Selfe. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, unemployment was a problem in the area, so a local woman named Lorna Brandt raised money for the construction of a walking track near the Lane Cove River as a way of providing relief work. The track begins at Thornleigh Oval, at the bottom of Handley Avenue, and goes through the bush towards the Lane Cove River. It then goes parallel to the river for a short distance before looping back to arrive at Comenarra Parkway. An extension goes down to the river, through a spot called Conscript Pass. At this spot, there are rock carvings done by the men who worked on the track. One of the carvings is a caricature of Bertram Stevens, Premier of New South Wales from 1932 to 1939.The Great North Walk, McDougall, Shearer-Heriot (Kangaroo Press) 1988, p.49 The track is known as Lorna Pass in memory of Lorna Brandt, and is now part of the Great North Walk, a long-distance walking trail between Sydney and Newcastle.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.19-20 Plans to establish a university at Thornleigh in response to the large number of enrollments at the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales were discussed in the early 1960s due to Thornleigh being \\"Central to the Northern Line and the North Shore\\", however, the university was eventually established in the suburb of Macquarie Park and is now known as Macquarie University. Transport Thornleigh railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. Pennant Hills Road is part of the National Highway, and is one of Sydney's major thoroughfares. The Esplanade from Pennant Hills is a main road accessing Thornleigh to Normanhurst. The Comenarra Parkway is an arterial road that stretches from Thornleigh through to West Pymble via Wahroonga, Turramurra and South Turramurra. Bus services from the Transdev NSW Upper North Shore service include: *587 - Hornsby to Westleigh via Waitara and Normanhurst *588 - Hornsby to Normanhurst West via Normanhurst service *589 - Hornsby to Sydney Adventist Hospital via Waitara, Normanhurst, Woodlands Estate and Thornleigh. Commercial areas Thornleigh contains industrial and commercial areas. Thornleigh Marketplace containing a supermarket and speciality stores was constructed in 2005 and includes: Australia Post Office, bakeries, butchers, hair and nail salons, pharmacy, newsagency, gym, sushi bar, cafes, optometrist and Woolworths. Shops and restaurants are located around Thornleigh railway station and nearby Pennant Hills. The household hardware chain Bunnings Warehouse have a store located next to Pennant Hills Road. American multinational fast food restaurant chain McDonald's have their Australian headquarters and flagship store in Thornleigh.

Population and demographics At the , the population of Thornleigh in 2016 was 8,464 people. Of these: ; Age distribution : The distribution of ages in Thornleigh was very similar to the country as a whole. Thornleigh residents' median age was 39 years, compared to the national median of 38. Children aged under 15 years made up 21% of the population (national average was 19%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 14% of the population (national average was 14%). ; Ethnic diversity : 63.5% of Thornleigh residents were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 65.5%; The next most common countries of birth were China 5.6%, England 3.8%, India 3.0%, Philippines 1.6% and New Zealand 1.5%. 68.8% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 6.1%, Cantonese 3.1%, Arabic 3.0% and Korean 1.7%. Only 21.8% of the population identified their ancestry as Australian, 23.3% English, 9.0% Chinese, 7.9% Irish and 6.1% Scottish. ; Religion: The most common responses for religion were: No Religion: 28.6%, Catholic: 24.8%, and Anglican: 14.7%. ;Income: The median weekly household income was $2,262 per week, higher than the national average of $1,438. ;Occupation: 66% of the population work in professions compared to the national average of 48.8%. Sports and Recreation The local sports clubs include the Thornleigh Sport and Recreation Club with baseball, basketball, cricket, netball, soccer and softball divisions. The soccer club known as Thunder FC consists of teams ranging from Under 6s through to All Age divisions playing in the Gladesville Hornsby Football Association. Home grounds are Oakleigh Oval and Ruddock Park. The Brickpit Park is used for Basketball where it is home to the Hornsby-Ku- Ring-Gai Basketball Association. It is also a popular sports venue for public and private schools in the Hornsby-Kuring-gai area. Other venues at the Brickpit Park include The Thornleigh Golf Centre, which includes driving ranges and mini-golf courses. Skateboarding and other passive recreational activities are also available at the Brickpit. Thornleigh Squash Centre has 9 glass backed courts.

History Westleigh derived its name from its location, directly west of Thornleigh. Development as a residential suburb began in 1967 and was marketed by Stewart Upton a large real estate firm following the subdivision of the area bounded by Duneba and Eucalyptus Drive, and the former riding school which was situated near Billarga Road. Prior to this time the area was rural with many citrus orchards, with a small number of homes on acreage along Quarter Sessions Rd, extending north towards the former sandstone quarry near \\"Blackfellow's Head\\", which was used as a dumping ground for stolen cars of the 1940s and 1950s. The area was originally heavily timbered, so many streets bear the names of Australian trees such as Stringybark Close, Spotted Gum Road, Eucalyptus Drive, Hibbertia Place, Peppermint Gum place and Ironbark Close.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 269 Although the naming of the streets seems only vaguely related to what was there before houses arrived, and many streets named for plants contain not a single representative specimen. Westleigh was originally a housing estate west of Quarter Sessions Road. A small parcel of land was opened at the same time on the eastern side of Quarter Sessions Rd and this include Gum Blossom Drive and Bottle Brush Road. While classified as Thornleigh West for it postal address it was given a Westleigh address in the 1980s. This parcel of land was owned by a large home unit construction firm‚ÄîRDC who built many project homes in Gum Blossom Drive. This company closed and the remaining land was sold to private parties in 1968. In 2016, the Hornsby Shire purchased 34 hectares of land from Sydney Water in Westleigh, intending to use this land as public open space for recreation. Geography Westleigh is bordered by Dural, Cherrybrook, Pennant Hills, Thornleigh and Hornsby. Berowra Valley National Park lies directly west of Westleigh. Defined by its geographical make-up, Westleigh is clearly divided at the midpoint of Quarter Sessions Road. This may be seen in a sudden absence of houses, as drivers find themselves immersed in a thick bushland foliage. The sweeping dip in this section has also proven a non-fatal but dangerous hazard for drivers throughout Westleigh's history, however reflective signs appear to have minimised the danger to tired or reckless drivers. This deviation, constructed in 1978, was to eliminate the dangerous bend in the original alignment as the road followed the edge of the gully. The original alignment still exists as Warrigal Drive, although in very poor condition, passing by the entrance to the former rubbish tip, and providing a second access to the Bushfire Brigade. North side The northern side of this bushland hiatus is the \\"newer\\" side of Westleigh, and features far fewer public amenities than those the southern side. The area was subdivided in 1974 and homebuilding commenced in 1977. The loop constructed at the northern end of Quarter Sessions Road has completely eradicated all traces of the former sandstone quarry which lay to the western side. South side The southern side of this division is the older side of Westleigh. Westleigh's public amenities are largely concentrated in this area, including the family friendly Westleigh Village Shopping Centre as well as nearby Cellars, day-care centre, dentist, petrol/service station, and a public primary school (Thornleigh West Public School) with a number of recreational features. In about 1983, the last areas of the south side were redeveloped. \\"Berenbel\\", a property at the end of Duffy Avenue, and another small market garden property at the corner of Duffy Avenue and Quarter Sessions Road disappeared beneath suburban housing. Three housing \\"villages\\" were built there, named \\"Sanctuary Gardens\\", \\"Wild Ash Grove\\" and \\"Huntingdale\\", in addition to the longer-established \\"Settlers' Green\\" (named in recognition of the \\"stalwart people who, by their actions opened the door to the migrants of the world and thus the nations development.\\"). The border of Westleigh was moved from the Duffy Ave/Quarter Sessions Road intersection, to further up Duffy Avenue. These housing estates brought more people - primarily families - into the southern side of the suburb around their establishment, boosting the suburb's population as reflected in the population changes between the 2001 and 2006 censuses. Parks and recreation Two large public parks are in the south side of Westleigh: Oakleigh Oval, home to Thornleigh Baseball Club as well as Thornleigh Thunder Football Club, and Ruddock Park (named to honour Max Ruddock, father of politician Phillip Ruddock, after his death in 1976 to acknowledge his official interest in the local Elouera Bushland Reserve), which was the site of annual \\"Carols by Candlelight\\" and summer outdoor movies. Play equipment, public toilets, and barbecue facilities are all freely available. Ruddock Park's tennis courts are available for hire: keys are held with the newsagent in the shopping centre nearby. A fenced off-leash dog park was established in about 2005 between Ruddock Park and the shopping centre. On 28 June 2018 it was announced that Westleigh Waterboard would be transformed into a multi-use recreational parkland with $40 Million funding from the Hornsby Shire. https://wwba.org.au Commercial Areas Westleigh Village Shopping Centre, includes a Supermarket Aldi, Newsagent, Chemist, Baker, Fruiterer and other specialist stores. The shopping village has undergone major renovations since 2016. Surrounding bushland Westleigh Waterboard: Despite once being a rubbish dump, dumping is now prohibited as the site will be converted to a recreational park. Most of the suburb (except the southern side) is surrounded by natural bushland, which at times poses significant bush fire danger. On the western side of the suburbs runs the Great North Walk, which can be accessed from multiple points within the suburb. Heading north, the walk leads to a nearby water hole \\"fragile rock\\", also known as \\"Fraggle Rock\\", which is an excellent spot for kids to enjoy themselves. It features a large ten meter cliff sometimes used for diving, underwater tunnels and minor waterfalls. However, swimmers should be aware of pollution levels when swimming in any bushland water system, especially within 48 hours of rainfall. Furthermore, swimmers should be aware of the potential danger of the area, including the death of a 20-year-old woman after slipping and becoming \\"impaled\\" on a tree in 2007. \\"Refuge Rock\\" is a large area of sandstone rock in the bushland to the west, used for training of soldiers prior to WWII; bushwalkers can observe blast marks from mortar fire in the sandstone. On the eastern side of the suburb between Warrigal Rd and Gum Blossum Drive lies an area of scrub and bushland formerly occupied by the council rubbish dump (closed in 1962), the former sewerage dump (closed in about 1964), and the Sydney Water Reservoir which was completed in 1967. The former council animal pound existed at the northern edge of the old tip, and the southern area was used for a number of years by the Sydney County Council for seasoning timber power poles (\\"The Pole Yards\\"). This area is now often used by a wide manner of 'Westleighians' for activities including walking, motorbike riding and general tom-foolerly which has been happening for over 30 years. Due to the existence of the local Sydney Water property, the disused rubbish dump and adjacent area is commonly locally referred to as the 'Waterboard'). Since it has been used for illegal rubbish dumping, public access is illegal and measures have been taken to block access to this area, including local rangers / volunteers patrolling the area. In 2015, Hornsby council purchased 34 hectares of this land to be used for recreational use, such as sporting fields. The local rural fire brigade have permission to use the area for training (including live fire drills), and are somewhat regularly seen carrying out various forms of training and drills. Transport Commuters have easy access to Thornleigh railway station. Transdev NSW provide bus services to nearby Normanhurst railway station and Hornsby railway station on the Sydney Trains Northern Line. Population At the , the suburb of Westleigh recorded a population of 4456 people. Of these: * Age: 19.7% of Westleigh's population is aged under 15, marginally more than the national average of 18.7%.

According to the Real Academia Espa√±ola, the word coco derives from the Galician and Portuguese c√¥co , which means \\"coconut\\".\\"Coco\\". Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola. Real Academia Espa√±ola. Retrieved 26 December 2012. The word coco is used in colloquial speech to refer to the human head in Spanish. Coco also means \\"skull\\". The word cocuruto in Portuguese means \\"the crown of the head\\" or \\"the highest place\\" and with the same etymology in Galicia, crouca means \\"head\\", from proto-Celtic *krowkƒÅ-,Cf. , s.v. cr≈´ca with variant cr√≥ca; and either coco or cuca means \\"head\\" in both Portuguese and Galician. It is cognate with Cornish crogen, meaning \\"skull\\", and Breton krogen ar penn, also meaning \\"skull\\". In Irish, clocan means \\"skull\\". Many Latin American countries refer to the monster as el Cuco. In northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, where there is a large Hispanic population, it is referred to by its anglicized name, \\"the Coco Man\\". In Brazilian folklore, the monster is referred to as Cuca and pictured as a female humanoid alligator, derived from the Portuguese coca, a dragon. Legend In Spain, Portugal, and Latin America (including Brazil), parents sometimes invoke the Coco or Cuca as a way of discouraging their children from misbehaving; they sing lullabies or tell rhymes warning their children that if they don't obey their parents, el Coco will come and get them and then eat them. It is not the way the Coco looks but what it does that scares most. It is a child eater and a kidnapper; it may immediately devour the child, leaving no trace, or it may spirit the child away to a place of no return, but it only does this to disobedient children. It is on the lookout for children's misbehavior from the rooftops; it takes the shape of any dark shadow and stays watching. It represents the opposite of the guardian angel and is frequently compared to the devil. Others see the Coco as a representation of the deceased of the local community. The oldest known rhyme about the Coco, which originated in the 17th century, is in the Auto de los desposorios de la Virgen by Juan Cax√©s. The rhyme has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning: The Portuguese lullaby recorded by Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos tells Coca to go to the top of the roof. In other versions of the same lullaby, the name of Coca is changed to that of \\"pap√£o negro\\" (black eater), the name of another bogeyman.leite de Vasconcelos,Jos√©. Revista Lusitana. Vol X The traditional Brazilian lullaby is as follows, with the Cuca as a female humanoid alligator: Brazilians also have a bogeyman version, which sometimes acquires regional colors where the bogeyman (the shape-shifting Bicho Pap√£o is a monster that is shaped by what the child fears most) is a small owl, murucututu, or other birds of prey that could be on the roof of homes at night. Verses and songs were used in pre- Roman Iberia to transmit history to the younger generations, as told by ancient authors. Sallust said the mothers sang the military feats of the fathers to incite the children to battle. He was later quoted by Servius, who emphasised that it was the role of the mothers to remember and teach the young men about the war feats of their fathers. Silius Italicus added more; he said that the young warriors sang songs in their native language while hitting their shields in the rhythm of the songs and that they were well versed in magic.Silius Italicus, Punica, book III, verse 34 Strabo, too, commented that history was recorded in verse. During the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of Latin America, the legend of the Coco was spread to countries such as Mexico, Argentina and Chile. Physical representations Corpus Christi celebration, in Mon√ß√£o, Portugal Cucafera during the Festa Major de Santa Tecla in Tarragona, Spain There is no general description of the cucuy, as far as facial or body descriptions, but it is stated that this shapeshifting being is extremely horrible to look at. The coco is variously described as a shapeless figure, sometimes a hairy monster, that hides in closets or under beds and eats children that misbehave when they are told to go to bed. Mythical animals Coca is also the name of a female dragon who featured in various medieval celebrations in the Iberian Peninsula. In Portugal one still survives in Mon√ß√£o; she fights in some sort of medieval tournament with Saint George during the Corpus Christi celebrations. She is called Santa Coca (\\"Saint Coca\\"), an allusion to the Irish saint, or Coca rabicha (\\"Tailed Coca\\"). If she defeats Saint George by scaring the horse, there will be a bad year for the crops and famine; if the horse and Saint George win by cutting off one of her ears with earring and her tongue, the crops will be fertile. Oddly enough, the people cheer for Saint Coca. In Galicia there are still two dragon cocas, one in Betanzos and the other in Redondela. The legend says that the dragon arrived from the sea and was devouring the young women until she was killed in combat by the young men of the city. In Mon√ß√£o, the legend says, she lives in the Minho; in Redondela she lives in the Ria of Vigo. The dragon shared the same name that was given in Portuguese and Spanish to the cog (a type of ship), and although used mainly for trade, it was also a war vessel common in medieval warfare and piracy raids on coastal villages.La coca en el intercambio mercante Atl√°ntico-Mediterr√°neo Visbyresan 2011 med koggen Tvekamp av Elbogen . Fotevikens Museum The oldest reference to Coca is in the book Livro 3 de Doa√ß√µes de D. Afonso III from the year 1274, where it is referred to as a big fish that appears on the shore:d'Azevedo, Pedro. Revista Lusitana.Miscel√¢nia. Volume IV Antiga Casa Bertrand, 1896 \\"And if by chance any whale or sperm whale or mermaid or coca or dolphin or Musaranha or other large fish that resembles some of these die in Sesimbra or Silves or elsewhere[.]\\" In Catalonia, the Cuca fera de Tortosa was first documented in 1457. It is a zoomorphic figure that looks like a tortoise with a horned spine, dragon claws and a dragon head. The legend says she had to dine every night on three cats and three children. This legend of the Coca can be compared to the one of Peluda or Tarasque. In Brazil, the Coco appears as a humanoid female alligator called Cuca. She is dressed like a woman with ugly hair and a sack on her back. Cuca appears as the one of the main villains in children's books by Monteiro Lobato, but in the books she appears like a powerful witch that attacks innocent children. Artists illustrating these books depicted the Cuca as an anthropomorphic alligator. She is an allusion to Coca, a dragon from the folklore of Portugal and Galicia. Heads In Portuguese, the skull-like carved vegetable lanterns are called \\"coco\\" or \\"coca\\". fibula representing a warrior carrying a severed head Galaico- Lusitanian 'severed head' from Castro culture The sailors of Vasco da Gama called the fruit of the Polynesian palm tree \\"coco\\". The word \\"coconut\\" is derived from their name. Traditionally in Portugal, however, the coco is represented by an iron pan with holes, to represent a face, with a light inside; or by a vegetable lantern carved from a pumpkin with two eyes and a mouth, which is left in dark places with a light inside to scare people.Figueiredo, C√¢ndido.

In the first half of the 20th century the coca was an integral part of festivities like All Souls' Day and the ritual begging of P√£o-por-Deus. The tradition of P√£o-por-Deus, already mentioned in the 15th century, is a ritual begging for bread and cakes, done door to door by children, though in the past poor beggars would also take part. Its purpose is to share the bread or treats gathered door to door with the dead of the community, who were eagerly awaited and arrived at night in the shape of butterflies or little animals, during the traditional magusto.[Ernesto Veiga de Oliveira.

Miscel√¢nea etnogr√°fica In Portugal, depending on the region, the P√£o-por-Deus assumes different names: santoro or santorinho, dia dos bolinhos (cookies day), or fieis de deus.[Pimentel, Alberto. Espelho de portuguezes - Volume 2 - P√°gina 1191] This same tradition extends to Galicia, where it is called migallo. It has a close resemblance with the traditions of souling or nowadays trick-or-treating. While the P√£o-por-Deus or Santoro is the bread or offering given to the souls of the dead, the Molete or Samagaio is the bread or offering that is given when a child is born.[Actas / International Colloquium on Luso-Brazilian Studies - Volume 1 - P√°gina 162] > In this same city of Coimbra, where we find ourselves today, it is customary > for groups of children to walk on the streets, on the 31st October and 1st > and 2nd November, at nightfall, with a hollow pumpkin with holes that were > cut out pretending to be eyes, nose and mouth, as if it was a skull, and > with a stump of candle lit from within, to give it a more macabre > look.Manuel de Paiva Bol√©o, Universidade de Coimbra.

Minist√©rio das Rela√ß√µes > Exteriores, Se√ß√£o de Publica√ß√µes, 1960 To ensure that the souls found their way back home, the Botador de almas, whose mission was to lay souls (botar almas), would go every night through valleys and mountains and up on trees ringing a little bell, or carrying a lantern and singing a prayer to the souls. Every Portuguese village had one. Calling and singing to the souls is an ancient tradition done either by one person alone or in groups and it has many names: \\"lan√ßar as almas\\", \\"encomendar as almas\\", \\"amentar as almas\\", \\"deitar as almas\\", \\"cantar √†s almas santas\\". The serandeiros are disguised young men, covered with a blanket, a bed sheet or a hooded cloak. They carry a staff (a stick of quince or of honeyberry, about their own height) in one hand, and in the other they carry a small bundle of basil or apples that they make the girls that take part of the desfolhada smell, or with which they tickle people's cheeks; sometimes, to play a prank, they bring stinging nettles. When a girl recognizes the serandeiro or if she recognizes her boyfriend masked as a serandeiro, she throws him an apple brought from home.M√öSICA POPULAR E DIFEREN√áAS REGIONAIS.

They would also be cherished for their divinatory, prophetic and healing powers.O ALENTEJO E O CULTO C√âLTICO DAS CABE√áAS. Almanaque Alentejano.N¬∫7 The display places for the Iron Age severed heads were in the inside or outside of buildings with a preference for public places, with streets and people passing by and always preferring high places. Our Ladies In Portugal, rituals among the Catholic religious order of Our Lady of Cabeza, a Black Madonna, include the offering of heads of wax to the Lady, praying the Hail Mary while keeping a small statue of Our Lady on top of the head; the pilgrims pray with their own heads inside a hole in the wall of the chapel. The Chapel of Our Lady of the Heads (Nossa Senhora das Cabe√ßas) situated northwest of the ruins of the Roman era temple of Our Lady of the Heads (Orjais, Covilh√£) evidences a continuity in the use of a sacred space that changed from a pagan worship cult area to a Christian one and continued to be a place of worship for centuries after. According to Pedro Carvalho, the pre-Roman findings and the unusual location of the ruins inside an 8th-century BC hillfort suggest it was the place of a pre-Roman cult.Castro de Orjais e ru√≠nas de uma constru√ß√£o junto √† Capela de Nossa Senhora das Cabe√ßas The Lady of the Head and Lady of the Heads are two of the many names given to Our Lady. Several of her names are thought to be of pre-Roman origin. Names like Senhora da Noite (\\"Lady of the Night\\"), Senhora da Luz (\\"Lady of the Light\\"), Se√±ora de Carbayo (\\"Lady of the Oak Tree\\") are spread all over the peninsula. In Portugal alone 972 titles for Our Lady have been found in churches, altars and images, not including the names of villages and places. Spain has a similar proliferation of titles for Our Lady. The common element to all these names is the title Lady. But the title Senhora (Portuguese) or Se√±ora (Spanish) is of Latin origin, and derives from the Latin senior;Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola thus there had to be another one of pre-Roman origin. In ancient times the titles that were used in Portugal by the ladies of the court were Meana (me Ana) or Miana (mi Ana) and Meona (me Ona); these words meant the same as miLady, that is, Ana and Ona were synonyms of Senhora and Dona. Ana is the name of the river Guadiana, thus pre-Roman in origin. Ana is also the name of a goddess of Irish mythology. In the village of Ponte, parish of Mou√ß√≥s, on a hill that overlooks the River Corgo, there is a chapel called Santo Cabe√ßo which legend says was built by the mouros encantados. On the wall facing south there is a hole, where legend says the mouros used to put their head to hear the sound of the sea. The local people also have the custom of putting their head inside the hole: some to hear the whisper that is similar to the waves of the sea, others to heal headaches. In Alcu√©scar, Spain, a legend says that a princess exhibited a stall of skulls and human bones. Hooded cloak The Farricoco in the procession \\"Ecce Homo\\" on Maundy Thursday, in Braga, Portugal In Portugal, coca is a name for a hooded cloak; it was also the name of the traditional hooded black wedding gown still in use at the beginning of the 20th century.C√îCA OU MANTILHA - S√âCULO XIX In Portim√£o during the holy week celebrations, in the prociss√£o dos Passos (Spanish: Procesi√≥n de los Pasos), a procession organized by the Catholic brotherhoods, the herald, a man dressed with a black hooded cloak that covered his face and had three holes for the eyes and mouth, led the procession and announced the death of Christ. This man was either named coca, farnicoco, (farricunco, farricoco from Latin far, farris and coco) or death. The name coca was given to the cloak and to the man who wore the cloak.J. Ant√≥nio Guerreiro Gascon. Festas e costumes de Monchique In 1498, the Portuguese King Manuel I gave permission to the Catholic brotherhood of the Miseric√≥rdia to collect the bones and remains from the gallows of those that had been condemned to death and put them in a grave every year on All Saints' Day.Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia de Santar√©m The brotherhood in a procession, known as Prociss√£o dos Ossos, were followed by the farricocos, who carried the tombs and collected the bones. In the travels of the Baron Rozmital, 1465-1467, a paragraph was written commenting on the traditional mourning clothes of the Portuguese of that time. The relatives of the deceased who accompanied his funeral would be clad in white and hooded like monks, but the paid mourners would be arrayed in black.Teophilo Braga. CURSO DE HISTORIA DA LITTERATURA PORTUGUEZA. Porto: 1885\\"[...] white was worn as the garb of mourning until the time of King Manuel, at the death of whose aunt, Philippa, black was adopted for the first time in Portugal as the symbol of sorrow for the dead\\".Holland, James. The tourist in Portugal: illustrated from paintings (1839) Giants Os cocos, giant representation of the coco and coca of Ribadeo. The tradition dates back to the 19th century. In Ribadeo, two giant figures represent \\"el coco y la coca\\" that dance at the sound of drummers and Galician bagpipe players. The land of the dead The 'land of the dead' is a mythic land which appears in traditions from various cultures around the ancient world. Probably the oldest mention of a mythic land of the dead located in the Iberian Peninsula is in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn. The legends of Portugal and Spain speak of an enchanted land, the Mourama, the land where an enchanted people, the Mouros (Celtic *MRVOS)MOURAS ENCANTADAS, AS NOSSAS AV√ìS. ALMANAQUE ALENTEJANO. dwell under the earth in Portugal and Galicia. The lore of Galicia says that \\"In Galicia there are two overlapped people: a part lives on the surface of the land; they are the Galician people, and the other in the subsoil, the Mouros\\". Mourama is the otherworld, the world of the dead from where everything comes back. The Mourama is ruled by an enchanted being who is called rei Mouro (king Mouro). His daughter is the princesa Moura (princess Moura), a shapeshifter who changes herself into a snake, also called bicha Moura, or can even be seen riding a dragon.  In literature and arts In the last chapter of the work of Miguel de Cervantes, the epitaph of Don Quijote identifies him as the scarecrow and el coco. Que Viene el Coco, a painting that depicts a cloaked, menacing figure, was painted by Goya in 1799.The Metropolitan Museum of Art The Cuco appears in AdventureQuest Worlds. It is among the creatures that attack Terra da Festa before the Carnaval Party. The Cuco resembles a Carnaval version of Blister. The Cuca later appears where it is depicted as a humanoid alligator in witch attire. Stephen King's 2018 novel The Outsider features a variation of El Cuco as its main villain. El Cucuy is featured in The Casagrandes episode \\"Monster Cash,\\" voiced by Eric Bauza. Carl Casagrande starts a ghost tour revolving around El Cucuy after hearing about it from his grandmother Rosa. Enlisting the assistance from Lalo, Sergio, and Stanley, Carl invites Ronnie Anne, Bobby, Adelaide, and Vito to partake in it. Afterwards, Carl, Lalo, and Sergio soon find that the El Cucuy legend appears to be true when it shows up and haunts Carl. It leaves when Carl does his chores and refunds the money he made. When El Cucuy visits the hot dog vendor Bruno, he was spooked until it was discovered to be a disguise worn by Rosa.

It merged with Latvian Way to form Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way in 2007. It was founded on 25 May 2002, led by ƒíriks Jƒìkabsons and AinƒÅrs ≈†lesers. The party included a number of priests from all the major branches of Christianity in Latvia (Lutheran, Catholic, Orthodox and Baptist) as well as members of JaunƒÅ Paaudze (New Generation), a controversial charismatic group. As a result, it was informally nicknamed \\"the party of priests\\" or the \\"pastors' party\\". Using populist promises and support from religious organisations, it won 9.5% of the popular vote and 10 out of 100 seats in the legislative elections of October 5, 2002 and joined all the coalition governments since that time until its dissolution. In the 2006 elections, it ran together with Latvian Way; the bloc took 8.58% but also won 10 seats in parliament. The parties merged in the following years. Political positions The party proclaimed itself to be a strong supporter of the traditional family. It sponsored a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, unambiguously excluding homosexual unions. Several prominent members of the party had been labelled as homophobic by its critics. E.g. JƒÅnis ≈†mits who was appointed to the position of chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee has called his parliamentary colleagues to get familiar with religious writings \\"in case they can actually, read\\", quoting a passage from the Book of Moses that could be loosely translated as: \\"men having gay sex must die, and their corpses must be left soaking in their own blood\\". Additionally, Latvijas PirmƒÅ Partija members had several times made public statements saying that they don't feel that there is a necessity for a gay pride march in Riga, which allegedly contradicts the Freedom of Speech and Peaceful Assembly enshrined in the Constitution of Latvia. The pressure group Mozaƒ´ka (Mosaic) have mostly organized Gay Rights Rallies that some religious organizations see as overt frontal attacks on the Latvian way of life. Mozaƒ´ka have stated that they have done this to raise awareness for the rights of gays in Latvia via international media. Between annual rallies Mozaƒ´ka has done little to slowly generate improved understanding of gays in Latvia and has preferred to follow its strategy of shock tactics. (articles 100 and 103). Some have alleged that quoting the Bible as a reference point for legislation can be viewed as unconstitutional, since Latvia is a secular state, where religion is separate from the state (article 99 of the Constitution of Latvia). Supporters of the First Party denied that the \\"separation of church argument\\" can properly be used to keep people of faith silent when it comes to issues of morality or the passing or failing of laws that have strong moral dimensions. The ideas under the separation of church and state doctrine have to do with (a) the state not being allowed to control the church, or (b) the church not being allowed to control the state. All legislators have the right to vote their conscience. Economically, First Party supported the existing status quo in Latvian economics. Compared to other parties, it was less concerned with budget deficits and believed that the government should do everything possible to stimulate economic growth, even at the cost of possibly running deficits. In its first parliamentary election in 2002, First Party also ran on an anti- corruption agenda. In the next election, it emphasized its competence and experience (in particular, the achievements of its leader, ≈†lesers, as the Minister of Transportation). On ethnic relations, First Party was viewed as more Russian-friendly than most of the Latvian political parties. Most of the party's supporters were ethnically Latvian, but it does not attempt to appeal to Latvian nationalism and has a number of ethnic minorities among its voters. Recently, it created a \\"Russian centre\\" for its ethnically Russian members. The leadership of the party included several prominent businessmen, most notably, its leader Ainars ≈†lesers. His critics attacked the First Party, saying that it was little more than a business project to further Slesers' interests in real estate business. His supporters pointed to many examples of improvement in Latvia's transportation infrastructure, including the airport and the national railroad. Largely because of the influence of the First Party, a new cabinet-level ministry was developed, The Ministry of Children and Family Affairs. The position of Minister of Children and Family Affairs was held by Baptist pastor Ainars Bastiks from 2002 to 2009. This ministry has emphasized reducing the number of children in Latvia's orphan care system. One strategy has been the development and implementation of a new national foster care recruiting and training program, which has grown considerably every year since 2004. Another emphasis of this ministry has to do with the elevation of the importance of the \\"father\\" in Latvian society. The national holiday, \\"Father's Day\\" has been proposed with the corresponding encouragements for fathers to take their paternal responsibilities seriously. Stiffer penalties for \\"deadbeat dads\\" who avoid paying child support have been enacted. Scandals The first chairman of the party, ƒíriks Jƒìkabsons, resigned as Minister of the Interior. Later, due to various disagreements about the direction that the party was taking, he left the party itself and became an independent MP. Following the 2005 municipal election, a J≈´rmala businessman Germans Milu≈°s attempted to bribe the members of city council to ensure the election of Juris Hlevickis, a First Party member, as J≈´rmala mayor. Hlevickis fell one vote short of becoming the mayor and, in 2007, both Milu≈°s and Hlevickis were convicted and received prison sentences. During the bribery attempt, Milu≈°s's phone conversations were wiretapped by Latvian police. The wiretaps contain cryptic conversations between Milu≈°s and AinƒÅrs ≈†lesers, which were leaked to national TV in 2006. This resulted in the resignation of ≈†lesers as the Minister of Transportation on March 17, 2006. ≈†lesers was not however charged or convicted of bribery and returned to the position of the Minister of Transportation in November 2006.

He presents 2GB Sydney's Monday to Friday morning show, and leads the Continuous Call Team, a rugby league-based talkback radio panel program. Early life Ray Hadley was born in 1954 and raised in a \\"housing commission house in Dundas Valley\\" Sydney but later went to live with his grandparents on an Eungai Rail farm on the mid north coast of New South Wales. While working as a cab driver, he was offered casual work at the radio station 2UE after giving the then news director, Mark Collier, a ride in his taxi. By 1982, he was covering sports including rugby league and horseracing. Radio career 2GB In December 2001, Hadley joined 2GB to present the weekend rugby league coverage but when fellow 2UE presenter Alan Jones moved to 2GB from 2UE in April 2002, he began presenting the morning show as well. Hadley's talkback show started in a traditional local community and state-based current affairs format but now includes federal politics. His favorite music genre is country (both traditional and modern). Hadley's opening theme is \\"Murrumbidgee\\" by The Wolverines, while the closing theme is the instrumental \\"Last Date\\" from country pianist Floyd Cramer. Hadley's program from 9am to midday is also broadcast to 4BC Brisbane, 2CC Canberra and stations across regional New South Wales, Queensland and parts of Victoria. Some of these stations are part of the Southern Cross Austereo Triple M network and are some of the stations which also broadcast the Continuous Call Team. In May 2011 he became the highest-rating radio announcer on Australian radio with 20.1% of the audience, until being beaten by the top rating Ross and John breakfast program on opposite number 3AW in Melbourne a year later. On 19 May 2011 Hadley hung up on 7 News reporter Lee Jeloscek during a phone interview. Hadley took offence that Jeloscek wanted to correct something he asserted was suggested on-air before the interview began, and Hadley cut off Jeloscek mid-sentence telling his listeners: No hang on.

He won that award again 2009 and became the first radio broadcaster to win both that award and best sports commentator. He has won 20 major ACRA Radio awards since 1987. Television After commencing as a sports reporter on Channel 7, Hadley was recruited to Channel 9 as part of The Footy Show, along with his radio and rugby league colleague Steve \\"Blocker\\" Roach, appearing between 1994 and 1998. He also made a one-off appearance on The Footy Show in 2005 in a forum to discuss brawling and antagonism between Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs supporters during a game against the Brisbane Broncos at Telstra Stadium. Hadley has also appeared in TV commercials, and for 17 years was spruiking the budget menswear establishment Lowes. During 2010, he appeared on The Matty Johns Show on the Seven Network, an NRL-focused program hosted by Matthew Johns. Also in 2010, Hadley was signed by Sky News Australia to present a weekly current affairs programme entitled Hadley!. The programme aired on Wednesday nights. , Hadley resigned from Sky News Australia after only four episodes, reportedly due to \\"differences\\" and staff not wanting to work with him. In October 2011, Hadley was signed up by Channel 9 to commentate on the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi- final match between the Wallabies and the All Blacks but was not invited to return. In 2012, he returned to The Footy Show as a panellist on the Five in the Bin segment, commentating alongside Peter Sterling and Paul Vautin on Channel 9's rugby league coverage. Hadley was one of Channel 9's main play-by- play commentators mainly commentating on Thursday and Friday night games until leaving the position at the end of the 2018. Controversies Australian Communications and Media Authority Hadley has been repeatedly censured by the ACMA for a range of offences. In 2012, Hadley threatened a protester outside 2GB's premises and later broadcast the protester's name and address on air. It emerged during the investigation that Hadley had got the man's address wrong, instead broadcasting the address of somebody with the same name. The ACMA found against Hadley, finding he breached privacy regulations. On 25 June 2012, Hadley broadcast a fabricated story stating that school children visiting Parliament would no longer be given snacks because of budget cuts. When the story was denied by the then Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan, Hadley called Swan a liar, stating Swan was \\"complete boofhead that didn't know what was happening\\". Despite repeated requests to retract the story, Hadley refused to do so and was found in breach of the code. Despite clear evidence, Hadley continued to deny that he had lied, stating on air, \\"Through life you can't win in an argument with the arbiter, with the referee and I can't win in a battle with the Australian Communications and Media Authority despite the fact that I think I'm right,\\" Athens Olympics In 2004, Hadley was recorded in the middle of an outburst aimed at now-former 2GB news director Justin Kelly at the 2004 Athens Olympics, after Hadley's call of an event at the Games was not used in a news bulletin. His use of the words \\"fucking spastic\\" offended organisations that deal with people which such conditions, and Ray made a quick apology and offered his services to the organisations affected for no charge. Also during the outburst, the profane word \\"fucking\\" was used 20 times. A dance version of the outburst was soon created and played on Triple J and soon widely distributed and played around the country. Suspension and reinstatement In February 2013, Hadley was suspended from 2GB after verbally abusing an employee, who recorded the event. Hadley responded to the suspension by contacting the station major shareholder and close friend, John Singleton, demanding to be returned to the air. Singleton agreed and overruled Network managing director Rob Loewenthal. Following this, Hadley gathered 2GB staff into a boardroom, apologised for his behaviour, repeatedly breaking down in tears. Hadley's ratings dropped considerably following the release of details of the suspension. The employee in question sued Hadley, and the case was later settled out of court for an \\"undisclosed sum\\", the settlement including an agreement that the recording of Hadley's outburst be suppressed. Martin Place siege In February 2015, Hadley claimed on his show that he could have stopped the siege, saying \\"If me a broadcaster had spoken louder about the three bail decisions on Man Monis, lives would have been saved.\\"The Ray Hadley Morning Show: Highlights by Macquarie Media Limited on iTunes 2019 bullying allegations In March 2019, a social media post written by former 2GB staff member Chris Bowen contained allegations that he had been the victim of sixteen years of \\"intense bullying\\" while working at the station and that he had been subjected to \\"out of control sheer rage\\".Wilson, Zanda (25 March 2019) Ray Hadley accused of bullying by former producer, Radio Today.

Hadley responded to Bowen's allegations on his radio program and apologised to Bowen for \\"any hurt\\" he may have caused him. Bowen said he rejected Hadley's apology, describing his comments as \\"gaslighting\\". Bowen's allegation prompted ABC Television current affairs program 7.30 to do a special report about Hadley's alleged bullying.Park, Andy (3 April 2019) 2GB radio broadcaster Ray Hadley faces fresh bullying allegations, ABC News, ABC Television. Retrieved 22 November 2019.

Responding to the allegations made on 7.30, 2GB said they had not received any formal complaints from Moore, Perez or Bowen. In a statement, Hadley said he had been \\"very public\\" in relation to his past behaviour but if any of the allegations were substantiated, he would like to \\"make amends\\" with those affected by his alleged behaviour.(3 April 2019) Questions for Ray Hadley, Ray Hadley Statement, ABC News.

Radio broadcaster Tim Brunero publicly supported the allegations made by Perez.Brunero, Tim (11 April 2019) The radio station built on bullying, The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 22 November 2019. Brunero claimed he had witnessed Perez being summoned to Hadley's studio before later returning and telling Brunero that Hadley had allegedly subjected to him to a \\"blistering, shrieking tirade that's only possible in a soundproof room\\". Brunero claimed he had asked Perez to write an account of his encounter with Hadley, and that as of 2019, it was still sitting in his email inbox. Andrew Hornery, a columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald, also recalled an alleged encounter with Hadley in 2014 when Hadley referred to his sexual orientation on air which had prompted \\"a deluge of homophobic abuse on social media\\" from Hadley's listeners.Hornery, Andrew (6 April 2019) Harangued by Hadley: more accusers come forward, The Sydney Morning Herald.

In July 2019, it was reported Bowen had commenced legal proceedings in the New South Wales District Court against Hadley, relating to alleged workplace bullying.Haydar, Nour (25 July 2019) Ray Hadley reveals former producer Chris Bowen is taking him to court over bullying claims, ABC News. Retrieved 22 November 2019. Hadley admitted on air to having received notice about Bowen commencing his legal action, and said that he had been subject to \\"intense public scrutiny\\" with the allegations made about his behaviour, and that he had already admitted to his \\"previous shortcomings\\". Hadley also said his current colleagues would attest to the efforts he has made in recent years to improve his behaviour. Legal action Andrew Voss In August 2011, a statue of rugby league caller, Ray Warren, co-funded by Ray Hadley's radio station, 2GB, and Channel 9, was unveiled. Andrew Voss, noted on Channel 9 rugby league chat show, The Sunday Roast, that the statue was not a very good likeness. Ray Hadley used his radio show for the two days following the comments to launch attacks on Voss, labelling him a \\"grub of the highest order\\", a \\"moron\\", and claiming that the gulf between Ray Warren and Andrew Voss, both as commentators and as men, was immeasurable. It was claimed by Voss that Hadley's reaction was due to a perceived snub 17 years earlier when Voss was offered a television role over Hadley. Voss launched legal action against Hadley which was settled in 2012, with Voss receiving a financial settlement and public apology from Hadley. Greg Smith In April and May 2012, Ray Hadley, on his 2GB radio program, made allegations about then New South Wales Attorney General, Greg Smith, that he gave advice to his friend, Father Finian Egan, that an alleged victim of child sex abuse perpetrated by Egan in the 1970s and 1980s was seeking a $1,000,000 payment. Smith took Hadley to court, with both parties later dropping the case in exchange for Hadley refraining to broadcast further on the matter. MP Ray Williams Hadley was successfully sued by Liberal Hawkesbury MP Ray Williams. In July 2012 Hadley branded Williams a liar in a fabricated story over a scandal involving allegations of embezzled funds at the Hills Shire. Hadley falsely claimed Williams had known about it as far back as 2008 and covered it up. Three weeks before the trial was due to start, Hadley allegedly aggravated the defamation in a spray about another Liberal MP, Bart Bassett, and his appearance at ICAC. This prompted Williams' barrister, one of Sydney's most formidable silks, Tom Blackburn, SC, to file a contempt of court motion, given that the spray had occurred as a jury was about to be empanelled. Hadley told his audience he looked \\"forward to any Supreme Court acting involving Mr Williams or any other politician in New South Wales. It might be the only time in history that a so-called shock jock's credibility is running higher than a politician's credibility\\". The defamation trial was due to begin on Monday just passed (8 September) at 10am. At the 11th hour, the parties sought an adjournment and a settlement was reached. On Wednesday morning Hadley issued a retraction, which he delivered live to air. Williams said the terms of the settlement were confidential, but added: \\"It's been a long drawn-out process for me and my family. But we are pleased to advise that we are completely satisfied with the outcome.\\" Ahmed court case Hadley was sued by Kim Anne Ahmed. Hadley attacked Mrs Ahmed on air because she continued to support her husband, who had been charged with aggravated indecent assault of a 17 year old employee, and because she took out an AVO against the young victim's father. In an interview with the victim's father in May 2008, Hadley described the fish and chip shop owner's supporters as \\"vile\\". Later in the broadcast, Hadley said that if either Mr Ahmed or his \\"grub of a wife\\" still owned their shop, \\"they should completely and utterly be sent out of business\\". In December 2013, the judge ordered a $280,000 award to Mrs Ahmed, describing the broadcast as \\"an unbridled tirade\\" that came \\"from the gutter\\" Personal life Hadley has two children with his former wife, Anne Marie. Hadley married Suzanne in 1994. They separated in late 2010 but reconciled a few months later. However they separated again in 2014, and Suzanne began dating Matt Parish, the Canberra Raiders assistant coach and assistant coach of the New South Wales 2014 State of Origin team. In May 2014 it was revealed that Hadley had unsuccessfully attempted to have Parish fired from his post with the NRL after Suzanne and Parish began their relationship.

He has also been a prominent playback singer. Ghulam Ali was a disciple of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan (elder Ghulam Ali Khan). Ali was also trained by Bade Ghulam Ali's younger brothers- Barkat Ali Khan and Mubarak Ali Khan. Ghulam Ali is considered to be one of the best ghazal singers of his era. His style and variations in singing Ghazals has been noted as unique, as he blends Hindustani classical music with ghazals, unlike any other ghazal singer. Highly popular in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, as well as among South Asian diaspora in the US, the UK and the Middle Eastern countries. Many of his hit ghazals have been used in Bollywood movies. His famous ghazals are Chupke Chupke Raat Din, Kal Chaudhvin Ki Raat Thi, Hungama Hai Kyon Barpa, Chamakte Chand Ko, Kiya Hai Pyar Jis√©, May Nazar S√© Pee Raha Hoon, Mastana Peey√©, Y√© dil y√© pagal dil, Apni Dhun Mein Rehta Hoon a ghazal by Nasir Kazmi, \\"Ham Ko Kiske Gham Ne Maara\\".

In 2015, due to protest by Shiv Sena at Mumbai, his concert was cancelled.Pakistani Singer's Concerts in India Are Canceled After Shiv Sena Protests The New York Times, Published 8 October 2015. Retrieved 16 July 2019 After this, he received invitations from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. After this cancellation, he performed at Lucknow, India., New Delhi and in Trivandrum, and Kozhikode, Kerala, India. In a news item reported in 2015, Ghulam Ali has said that he won't perform in India in the future. He said that he does not want to be used for political mileage. Early life His name 'Ghulam Ali' was given by his father, a great fan of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan who, in the past, used to live in Lahore. Ghulam Ali had always been listening to Khan since childhood. Ghulam Ali encountered Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, for the first time, when he was in his early teens. Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan had toured Kabul, Afghanistan and, on the way back to India, Ghulam Ali's father requested the Ustad to take his son as a disciple. But Khan insisted that since he was hardly in town, regular training wouldn't be possible. But after repeated requests from Ghulam Ali's father, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan asked the young Ghulam Ali to sing something. It wasn't easy to have the courage to sing before him. He mustered the courage to sing the Thumri \\"Saiyyan Bolo Tanik Mose Rahiyo Na Jaye..\\". After he finished, Ustad hugged him and made him his disciple. Career Ghulam Ali started singing for Radio Pakistan, Lahore in 1960. Along with singing ghazals, Ghulam Ali composes music for his ghazals. His compositions are raga-based and sometimes include a scientific mixture of ragas. He is known for blending gharana-gaayaki into ghazal and this gives his singing the capability to touch people's hearts. He sings Punjabi songs too. Many of his Punjabi songs have been popular and have been part of Punjab's own cultural diaspora. Though from Pakistan, Ghulam Ali remains as popular in India as in Pakistan. Asha Bhosle has done joint music albums with him. He was introduced to Hindi cinema with a Hindi film song Chupke Chupke Raat Din written by the poet Hasrat Mohani in B. R. Chopra's film, Nikaah (1982)., Ghulam Ali Filmography on IMDb. Retrieved 16 July 2019 Other popular ghazals include Hungama Hai Kyon Barpa and Awaargi. He tends to select the ghazals of famous poets. On being questioned about Pakistani pop groups, Ghulam Ali replied, \\"Frankly, I am really bewildered at their style of singing. How can you sing a song by running and jumping around the stage? The stage is meant for performing not for acrobatics.\\" Ghulam Ali in Hyderabad, 2007 Ghulam Ali has also sung some Nepali ghazals like Kina kina timro tasveer, Gajalu tee thula thula aankha, Lolaaeka tee thula and Ke chha ra diun in Nepali language with Narayan Gopal, a well known Nepali singer, and composer Deepak Jangam. Those songs were written by King Mahendra of Nepal. These songs were compiled in an album entitled Narayan Gopal, Ghulam Ali Ra Ma, and are popular among Nepali music lovers to this day. One of his memorable concerts was at the Taj Mahal.Ghulam Ali sings in praise of the Taj The Times of India, published 10 July 2007.

In the case of a field F, the group is , where 0 refers to the zero element of F and the binary operation ‚Ä¢ is the field multiplication, *the algebraic torus GL(1)..  Examples  *The multiplicative group of integers modulo n is the group under multiplication of the invertible elements of \\\\mathbb{Z}/n\\\\mathbb{Z}. When n is not prime, there are elements other than zero that are not invertible. * The multiplicative group of positive real numbers \\\\mathbb{R}^+ is an abelian group with 1 its identity element. The logarithm is a group isomorphism of this group to the additive group of real numbers, \\\\mathbb{R}. * The multiplicative group of a field F is the set of all nonzero elements: F^\\\\times = F -\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, under the multiplication operation. If F is finite of order q (for example q = p a prime, and F = \\\\mathbb F_p=\\\\mathbb Z/p\\\\mathbb Z), then the multiplicative group is cyclic: F^\\\\times \\\\cong C_{q-1}. Group scheme of roots of unity The group scheme of n-th roots of unity is by definition the kernel of the n-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a group scheme. That is, for any integer n > 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes n-th powers, and take an appropriate fiber product of schemes, with the morphism e that serves as the identity. The resulting group scheme is written Œºn (or \\\\mu\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\mu_n). It gives rise to a reduced scheme, when we take it over a field K, if and only if the characteristic of K does not divide n. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with nilpotent elements in their structure sheaves); for example Œºp over a finite field with p elements for any prime number p. This phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. For example, it turns out to be of major importance in expressing the duality theory of abelian varieties in characteristic p (theory of Pierre Cartier). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing Kummer theory.  Notes   References  * Michiel Hazewinkel, Nadiya Gubareni, Nadezhda Mikhaƒ≠lovna Gubareni, Vladimir V. Kirichenko.

On the mainland, this includes the area southeast of Powell River to the ferry terminal at Saltery Bay and northwest of Powell River to Desolation Sound and the terminus of Highway 101 in Lund. Lasqueti Island and Texada Island, along with the southernmost Discovery Islands (including Hernando and Savary), are included, as are the largely uninhabited lands to the north and west of this area. As of the 2006 census, 19,599 people lived in the District. Its head offices are located in Powell River. The District is governed by a board of seven directors: five electoral area directors who are elected for a four-year term by voters in the electoral areas, and two municipal directors who are first elected to the City of Powell River‚Äôs council and then appointed by council to the regional board. The board chair is elected annually by all directors.

Cherrybrook is located in the Hills District of Sydney. History European settlement Joseph Harrison, who had married Mary Ann Thompson, settled on a block in the area in 1839, planted orchards and built a small timber cottage they called \\"Cherrybrook Cottage\\". The name \\"Cherrybrook\\" is believed to have come from the fact they grew cherry trees near the creek, which passed through their land. Their block, which became known as \\"Cherrybrook Farm\\", had been granted originally to Mary Russell during the 1820s. The orchards here produced peaches, apricots, pears, plums, and citrus fruit. Many years later the property was bought by Eric Vaux, who established a dairy and kept the name Cherrybrook. In February 1959, the land was subdivided to become the first project home village in Sydney. The original bushland was bulldozed, and exhibition homes were built on cut and fill sites, then landscaped. Accelerated development occurred again in the remaining rural areas in the 1980s, and Cherrybrook Post Office opened on 20 July 1994. Street names Many of Cherrybrook's streets are named after native plants, trees, historical figures from convict times or local landowners. When Cherrybrook was subdivided from 1959 onwards, the developers chose colonial architects as a theme for naming some streets. None of the colonial architects and surveyors were associated with or lived in Cherrybrook.Source: Patrick, Trevor G. 1994, Street Names of Pennant Hills and Surrounding Suburbs of Beecroft, Cheltenham, Cherrybrook, Thornleigh, Westleigh, and West Pennant Hills, Silicon Quill, Hornsby, p.13. * Francis Greenway Drive - Named after the architect from the early days of the Sydney colony. * Macquarie Drive - Named after the fifth Governor of NSW, Major- General Lachlan Macquarie *Lambe Place - David Lambe (1802‚Äì1843), architect and farmer, was born in London in 1802.

The name is a portmanteau of the priests' surnames. Mariano Gomez de los Angeles was a well-known Catholic priest during their time, part of the trio accused of mutiny by Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines in the 19th century. Gomez was the child of Alejandro Francisco Gomez and Martina Custodia. He was born in the suburb of Santa Cruz, Manila on 2 August 1799. He was a Tornatras, one born from mixed native (Filipino), Chinese, and Spanish ancestries. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and later studied theology at the University of Santo Tomas, preparing himself for the priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. Gomez was designated as the head priest of Bacoor, Cavite on 2 June 1824. He also taught for the agriculture and cottage industries aside from taking care of spiritual necessities. He fought for the rights of his fellow native priests against Spanish abuses. He was also active in the publication of the newspaper La Verdad. On 17 February 1872, he was one of the priests executed due to the false accusations of treason and sedition, taking a supposed active role in the Cavite Mutiny. He was later on sentenced to death by garrote in a military court at Bagumbayan field. Jose Burgos was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur on 9 February 1837 and was baptized on the 12th of the same month. His parents were Jose Burgos, a Spanish lieutenant in the Spanish militia of Ilocos, and Florencia Garcia, a native of Vigan. During his early teenage years, he studied at the Colegio San Juan de Letran and later went to the University of Santo Tomas, receiving a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1855, Bachelor of Theology in 1859, Licentiate in Philosophy in 1860, Licentiate in Theology in 1862, Doctor of Theology, and Doctor of Canon Law in 1868. Jacinto Zamora was born on 14 August 1835 in Pandacan, Manila. His parents were Venancio Zamora and Hilario del Rosario. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts. He later transferred to the University of Santo Tomas and obtained a degree of Bachelor of Canon and Civil Laws. He prepared for priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. He had dreamt of becoming a priest at a young age. After being given ministerial and priestly authority, Zamora was able to establish parishes in Marikina, Pasig, and Batangas and was assigned to also oversee Manila Cathedral on 3 December 1864. Gomburza incurred the hatred of Spanish authorities for fighting for equal rights among priests and leading the campaign against the Spanish friars. They fought on the issues of secularization in the Philippines that led to the conflict of religious and church seculars. Their execution had a profound effect on many late 19th- century Filipinos; Jos√© Rizal, later to become the country's national hero, would dedicate his novel El filibusterismo to their memory. Mutiny by workers in the Cavite Naval Yard was the pretext needed by the authorities to redress a perceived humiliation from the principal objective, Jos√© Burgos, who threatened the established order. During the Spanish colonial period, four social class distinctions were observed in the islands: Spaniards who were born in Spain, peninsulares; Spaniards born in the colonies of Spain (Latin America or the Philippines), insulares or creoles; Spanish mestizos, Chinese or 'Indios' (natives) dwelling within or near the city (or town), and the church; and Chinese, Sangley, and rural Indios. Burgos was a Doctor of Philosophy whose prominence extended even to Spain, such that when the new Governor and Captain-General Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre arrived from Spain to assume his duties, he invited Burgos to sit beside him in his carriage during the inaugural procession, a place traditionally reserved for the archbishop and who was a peninsular Spaniard. The arrival of the liberal de la Torre was opposed by the ruling minority of friars, regular priests who belonged to an order (Dominicans, Augustinians, Recollects, and Franciscans) and their aliens in civil government. It was supported by the secular priests, most of whom were mestizos and darnas assigned to parishes and far flung communities, who believed that the reforms and the equality that they wanted with peninsular Spaniards were finally coming. In less than two years, de la Torre was replaced by Rafael de Izquierdo. Martyrdom The execution of Gomburza remains as one of the most controversial issues deeply embedded in Philippine history. However, their tragic end led to the dawn of the Philippine Nationalism in the 19th century, intensified by Dr. Jose P. Rizal, in dedicating his second novel entitled El Filibusterismo which condemned the Spanish rule and the elite Filipinos. In his novel, Rizal wrote \\"To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (89 years old), Don Jose Burgos (40 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora (55 years old). Executed in Bagumbayan Field on 25th of February, 1897. The church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the government, by surrounding your trials with mystery and shadows causes the belief that there was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, by worshiping your memory and calling you martyrs, in no sense recognizes your capability. In so far, therefore, as your complicity in the Cavite Mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not cherish sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake in combat.\\" It must be noted, however, that Rizal's account was erroneous in detail as the execution took place on 17 February 1872, not on 28 February 1872, as Rizal mistakenly mentions. Additionally, the ages of the priests were listed down inaccurately. At the time of the execution, Gomez was 73 years old, Burgos was 35 years old, and Zamora was 37 years old. Their deaths were facilitated in a public execution at Bagumbayan (Luzon) using a garrote due to false accusations charged against them by Spanish authorities. Their alleged crimes included treason and sedition for being the supposed masterminds of the insurrection of Indios (native Filipinos) working in the Cavite arsenal. Furthermore, according to the Spanish military tribunal, they were believed to have been a part of a clandestine movement aimed to overthrow the Spanish government, making them a threat to the Spanish Clergy. The execution has since been labeled the Terror of 1872, and is recognized as a pivotal event contributing to the later Philippine Revolution from 1896 to 1898.  Historical accounts  The Execution was documented by a Spanish historian named Jose Montero Y Vidal who wrote a book entitled Historia General de Filipinas that centers on a Spaniard's perspective of the Cavite Mutiny. The inclusion of biased story- telling of the reasons for the execution of Gomburza later gained widespread criticisms. Vidal's account was corroborated by the then Governor-General Rafael Izquierdo. In his report, he narrated that the abolition of privileges enjoyed by the workers of Cavite arsenals caused the \\"revolution\\". He also blamed the media, specifically the Spanish press, regardless of democratic, liberal or republican affiliation, for the circulation of unrestrained media. The latter is said to have featured propaganda such as overthrowing a secular throne, which allegedly inspired the Indios (native Filipinos) to organize the mutiny. General Izquierdo also mentioned the native clergy being a part of the rebels who were against the Spanish friars. The clergy supposedly wanted to end the hold of Spain over the Philippines in order to elect a new hari who would rule the land and named Fathers Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora to be the ones responsible. The accounts of these two Spaniards supported one another, thus pointing to a planned conspiracy among educated leaders, mestizos, abogadillos, Manila and Cavite residents, and native clergy. Furthermore, on 20 June 1872, the feast of the Virgin Loreto was celebrated in the district of Sampaloc, involving a fireworks display as a normal tradition. However, according to Izquierdo and Vidal, the fireworks mislead those in Cavite, causing them to attack Spanish officers, fulfilling republican wishes to eradicate the Spanish presence. There was also a mass murder of friars, which made the arrest of Gomburza legal. Through a quick court trial, they were sentenced to death by strangulation. However, speculate arise with their swift end that stirred the public, with some of the controversies published by Philippine News Agency. The reports stated that the Spanish prosecutors bribed a witness to testify against the three priests who were charged with sedition and treason, which led to their death by garrote. Moreover, according to Edmund Plauchut, as quoted by Jaime Veneracion, late on the night of 15 February 1872, the three priests were found guilty of treason as instigators of mutiny in the Cavite Navy-yard and were sentenced to death by Spanish Court martial. The judgement of the court was read to the priest in Fort Santiago the next morning, and they were told that they would be executed the following day (17 February 1872). After they heard the sentence, Burgos broke into sobs, Zamora lost his mind and never recovered it, and only Gomez listened impassively. Almost forty thousand of Filipinos, who were at different places surrounding the platform, witnessed the execution of the Filipino priest and saw Saldua (the artilleryman who testified for the conviction of the priest). When Gomez's confessor, a Recollect friar, exhorted him loudly to accept his fate, he replied: ‚ÄúFather, I know that not a leaf falls to the ground but by the will of God. Since He wills that I should die here, His holy will be done.‚Äù Nonetheless, Dr. Trinidad Hermenigildo Pardo de Tavera, a Filipino scholar and researcher, informed the world of the Filipino side of the controversy. According to him, it was a mere mutiny by the laborers of the cavite arsenal for their dissatisfaction from the abolition of their privileges due to the orders of General Izquierdo on 20 January 1872. About 200 men, including soldiers, laborers, and residents of Cavite, headed by Sergeant Lamadrid, assassinated all Spanish officers in sight, including the commanding officer. But then, Gen. Izquierdo, along with the friars, exaggerated the event to alarm the Spanish Government in order to delay installing reforms for the native Filipinos. Such reforms included the establishment of a school of arts and trades, which aimed to improve the education of Filipinos but would mean that the friars would lose their power in the government. Gen. Izquierdo took advantage of the event to instill fear in the minds of native Filipinos. Unfortunately, the Spanish Government in Spain relied on the report of Gen. Izquierdo and made no more attempts to investigate the issue. They believed that the said movement was indeed a big and well planned conspiracy to dissolute the Spanish Sovereignty in the Philippines.  Cavite mutiny  The so-called Cavite Mutiny of workers in the arsenal of the naval shipyard over a pay reduction produced a witness willing to implicate the three priests, each of whom were summarily tried and sentenced to death by garrote on 17 February 1872. The bodies of the three priests were buried in a common, unmarked grave in the Paco Cemetery, in keeping with the practice of burying enemies of the state. Notably, in the archives of Spain, there is no record of how Izquierdo, a liberal, could have been influenced to authorize these executions. Gregorio Meliton Martinez, the Archbishop of Manila, refused to defrock the priests, as they did not break any canon law. He ordered the bells of every church to be rung in honor of the executed priests. The aftermath of the investigation produced scores of suspects, most of whom were exiled to Guam in the Marianas. Recovery of remains In 1998, the remains, believed to belong to the trio, were discovered at the Paco Park Cemetery by the Manila City Engineers Office.

It is the largest volcano on Mars in terms of area, with volcanic flow fields that extend for at least from its summit.Cattermole, 2001, p. 85. Although the volcano has a span comparable to that of the United States, it reaches an elevation of only at its highest point.Carr, 2006, p. 54. This is about one-third the height of Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano on the planet. The flanks of Alba Mons have very gentle slopes. The average slope along the volcano's northern (and steepest) flank is 0.5¬∞, which is over five times lower than the slopes on the other large Tharsis volcanoes.Boyce, 2008, p. 104. In broad profile, Alba Mons resembles a vast but barely raised welt on the planet's surface.See Carr, 2006, p. 54, Fig. 3.10 for MOLA profile of Alba Mons compared to Olympus Mons. The difference in relief is striking. It is a unique volcanic structure with no counterpart on Earth or elsewhere on Mars. In addition to its great size and low relief, Alba Mons has a number of other distinguishing features. The central portion of the volcano is surrounded by an incomplete ring of faults (graben) and fractures, called Alba Fossae on the volcano's western flank and Tantalus Fossae on the eastern flank. The volcano also has very long, well preserved lava flows that form a radiating pattern from the volcano's central region. The enormous lengths of some individual flows (>) implies that the lavas were very fluid (low viscosity) and of high volume. Many of the flows have distinctive morphologies, consisting of long, sinuous ridges with discontinuous central lava channels. The low areas between the ridges (particularly along the volcano's northern flank) show a branching pattern of shallow gullies and channels (valley networks) that likely formed by water runoff. Alba Mons has some of the oldest extensively exposed volcanic deposits in the Tharsis region. Geologic evidence indicates that significant volcanic activity ended much earlier at Alba Mons than at Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes volcanoes. Volcanic deposits from Alba Mons range in age from Hesperian to early Amazonian (approximately 3.6 to 3.2 billion years old). Name origin For years the volcano's formal name was Alba Patera. Patera (pl. paterae) is Latin for a shallow drinking bowl or saucer. The term was applied to certain ill-defined, scalloped-edged craters that appeared in early spacecraft images to be volcanic (or non-impact) in origin.Russell, J.F.; Snyder, C.W.; Kieffer, H.H. (1992). Origin and Use of Martian Nomenclature in Mars, H.H. Kieffer et al., Eds.; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 1312. In September 2007, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) renamed the volcano Alba Mons (Alba Mountain), reserving the term Alba Patera for the volcano's two central depressions (calderas). Nevertheless, the entire volcano is still commonly called Alba Patera in the planetary science literature.A Google Scholar search of the astronomy and planetary science literature from 2007 to 2011 reveals 106 uses of Alba Patera versus 5 for Alba Mons (accessed May 7, 2011). MOLA topographic map of Alba Mons and surroundings. The main edifice appears in colors of red to orange; the surrounding apron is in shades of yellow-orange to green. The relief is greatest to the north because the volcano straddles the dichotomy boundary. Elevated terrain of Ceraunius Fossae, which underlies part of the volcano, extends southward like a handle. The term Alba is from the Latin word for white and refers to the clouds frequently seen over the region from Earth-based telescopes.Hartmann, 2003, p. 308 The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 and was initially known as the Alba volcanic feature or the Arcadia Ring (in reference to the partial ring of fractures around the volcano). The IAU named the volcano Alba Patera in 1973. The volcano is often simply called Alba when the context is understood. Location and size Alba Mons is centered at in the Arcadia quadrangle (MC-3). Much of the volcano's western flank is located in the adjacent Diacria quadrangle (MC-2). Flows from the volcano can be found as far north as 61¬∞N and as far south as 26¬∞N (in the northern Tharsis quadrangle). If one takes the outer margin of the flows as the volcano's base, then Alba Mons has north‚Äìsouth dimensions of about and a maximum width of . It covers an area of at least 5.7 million km2 and has a volume of about 2.5 million km3. The volcano dominates the northern portion of the Tharsis bulge and is so large and geologically distinct that it can almost be treated as an entire volcanic province unto itself.Frankel, 2005, p. 134. Although Alba Mons reaches a maximum elevation of above Mars‚Äô datum, the elevation difference between its summit and surrounding terrain (relief) is much greater on the north side of the volcano (about ) compared to the south side (about ). The reason for this asymmetry is that Alba straddles the dichotomy boundary between the cratered uplands in the south and the lowlands to the north.

Physical description MOLA exaggerated relief view of Alba Mons central edifice and summit dome viewed from south (top) and north (bottom). Vertical exaggeration is 10x. Alba's size and low profile makes it a difficult structure to study visually, as much of the volcano's relief is indiscernible in orbital photographs.

Using MOLA data, planetary scientists are able to study subtle details of the volcano's shape and topography that were invisible in images from earlier spacecraft such as Viking. Central caldera complex of Alba Mons. The calderas are shallow compared to those on other Tharsis volcanoes. Within the larger caldera is a small shield capped by a concentric circular feature (near center). Image is about across (THEMIS daytime IR mosaic). The volcano consists of two, roughly concentric components: 1) an oval-shaped central body with approximate dimensions of by across surrounded by 2) a vast, nearly level apron of lava flows that extends an additional or so outward. The central body is the main topographic edifice of the volcano, marked by pronounced break in slope at the inner boundary of the apron. Extending east and west from the central edifice are two broad fan-shaped lobes (or shoulders), which give the volcano its elongation in the east-west direction.Ivanov, M.A.; Head, J.W. (2002). Alba Patera, Mars: Assessment of its Evolution with MOLA and MOC Data. 33rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. LPI: Houston, TX, Abstract #1349. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2002/pdf/1349.pdf. The central edifice has the steepest slopes on the volcano, although they are still only 1¬∞. The crest and upper flanks of the edifice are cut by a partial ring of graben that are part of the Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture system. Inside the ring of graben is an annulus of very low and in places reversed slopes that forms a plateau on top of which lies a central dome across capped by a nested caldera complex. Thus, the central edifice of Alba Mons resembles a partially collapsed shield volcano with a smaller, summit dome sitting on top (pictured right). The summit dome has a distinct tilt to the east. The caldera complex consists of a large caldera about by across at the center of the summit dome. A smaller, kidney-shaped caldera (about by ) lies in the southern half of the larger one. Both calderas are relatively shallow, reaching a maximum depth of only . The larger caldera is bounded at the westernmost end by a steep, semicircular wall tall. This wall disappears at the northern and southern sides of the caldera, where it is buried by volcanic flows originating from the younger, smaller caldera. The smaller caldera is outlined everywhere by a steep wall that varies in height over a range of a few hundred meters. The walls of both calderas are scalloped, suggesting multiple episodes of subsidence and/or mass wasting. Two small shields or domes, several hundred meters high, occur within and adjacent to the large caldera. The shield within the large caldera is about across. It is capped by a peculiar concentric circular feature in diameter (pictured left). Calderas form by collapse following withdrawal and depletion of a magma chamber after an eruption. Caldera dimensions allow scientists to infer the geometry and depth of the magma chamber beneath the summit of the volcano.Mouginis-Mark, P.J.; Harris, A.J.; Rowland, S.K. (2008).

The shallowness of Alba's calderas compared to those seen on Olympus Mons and most of the other Tharsis volcanoes implies that Alba's magma reservoir was wider and shallower than those of its neighbors.Cattermole, 2001, p. 86. Surface characteristics Dust mantle at the SW edge of small caldera on Alba Mons (HiRISE). Most of the central edifice of Alba Mons is mantled with a layer of dust approximately thick.Ruff, S. W.; Christensen, P. R. (2001). A Spectrally- based Global Dust Cover Index for Mars from Thermal Emission Spectrometer Data. First Landing Site Workshop for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers, Abstract #9026. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/mer2003/pdf/9026.pdf. The dust layer is visible in high resolution images of the summit (pictured right). In places, the dust has been carved into streamlined shapes by the wind and is cut by small landslides. However, some isolated patches of dust appear smooth and undisturbed by the wind.Keszthelyi, L.P. (2006). Dusty Top of Alba Patera Volcano. University of Arizona HiRISE Website. http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_001510_2195. (accessed May 18, 2011). Heavy dust cover is also indicated by the high albedo (reflectivity) and low thermal inertia of the region. Martian dust is visually bright (albedo > 0.27) and has a low thermal inertia because of its small grain size (<).Putzig, N.E. et al. (2005). Global Thermal Inertia and Surface Properties of Mars from the MGS Mapping Mission. Icarus, 173 Tbl. 1, Fig. 5, p. 331. (See the Martian surface.) However, the thermal inertia is high and albedo lower on the northern flanks of the volcano and in the apron area farther to the north. This suggests that the northern portions of Alba's surface may contain a higher abundance of duricrusts, sand, and rocks compared to the rest of the volcano. High thermal inertia can also indicate the presence of exposed water ice. Theoretical models of water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) from epithermal neutrons detected by the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) instrument suggest that the regolith just below the surface on Alba's northern flank may contain 7.6% WEH by mass.Feldman, W.C.; Mellon, M.T.; Gasnault, O.; Maurice, S.; Prettyman, T.H. (2008). Volatiles on Mars: Scientific Results from the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer in The Martian Surface: Composition, Mineralogy, and Physical Properties, J.F. Bell III, Ed.; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 135 and Fig. 6.8. . This concentration could indicate water present as remnant ice or in hydrated minerals.Barlow, N.G. (2008). Mars: An Introduction to its interior, Surface, and Atmosphere; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 202. . Alba Mons is one of several areas on the planet that may contain thick deposits of near-surface ice preserved from an earlier epoch (1 to 10 million years ago), when Mars‚Äô axial tilt (obliquity) was higher and mountain glaciers existed at mid-latitudes and tropics. Water ice is unstable at these locations under present conditions and will tend to sublimate into the atmosphere. Theoretical calculations indicate that remnant ice can be preserved below depths of 1 m if it is blanketed by a high-albedo and low-thermal-inertia material, such as dust.Feldman, W. C.; Prettyman, T. H.; Maurice, S.; Lawrence, D. J.; Pathare, A.; Milliken, R. E.; Travis B. J. (2011). Search for Remnant Water Ice from Past Glacial Climates on Mars: The Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer. 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #2420. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2011/pdf/2420.pdf. The mineral composition of rocks making up Alba Mons is difficult to determine from orbital reflectance spectrometry because of the predominance of surface dust throughout the region. However, global-scale surface composition can be inferred from the Mars Odyssey gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS). This instrument has allowed scientists to determine the distribution of hydrogen (H), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), chlorine (Cl), thorium (Th) and potassium (K) in the shallow subsurface. Multivariate analysis of GRS data indicates that Alba Mons and the rest of the Tharsis region belongs to a chemically distinct province characterized by relatively low Si (19 wt%), Th (0.58 pppm), and K (0.29 wt%) content, but with Cl abundance (0.56 wt%) higher than Mars' surface average.Gasnault, O. (2006). Unsupervised Definition of Chemically Distinct Provinces at Mars. 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #2328. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2328.pdf. Low silicon content is indicative of mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, such as basalt and dunite. Alba Mons is an unlikely target for unmanned landers in the near future. The thick mantle of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, probably making in situ rock samples hard to come by and thus reducing the site's scientific value. The dust layer would also likely cause severe maneuvering problems for rovers. Ironically, the summit region was originally considered a prime backup landing site for the Viking 2 lander because the area appeared so smooth in Mariner 9 images taken in the early 1970s. Geology Sheet flows on northwestern flank of Alba Mons. Note multiple overlapping lobes (THEMIS VIS) Lava flows extending north and northwest of Alba Mons. The sinuous ridges are tube- and channel-fed flows. Faint, degraded flows and ridges in the north are part of Alba's broad lava apron (MOLA). Much of the geologic work on Alba Mons has focused on the morphology of its lava flows and the geometry of the faults cutting its flanks. Surface features of the volcano, such as gullies and valley networks, have also been extensively studied. These efforts have the overall goal of deciphering the geologic history of the volcano and the volcano-tectonic processes involved in its formation. Such understanding can shed light on the nature and evolution of the Martian interior and the planet's climate history. Lava flows Alba Mons is notable for the remarkable length, diversity, and crisp appearance of its lava flows. Many of the flows radiate from the summit, but others appear to originate from vents and fissures on the lower flanks of the volcano. Individual flows may exceed in length.Pieri, D.; Schneeberger, D. (1988). Morphology of Lava Flows at Alba Patera. 19th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1471. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1988/pdf/1471.pdf. Lava flows near the summit calderas appear to be significantly shorter and narrower than those on more distal parts of the volcano.Schneeberger and Pieri, 1991, cited by McGovern et al., 2001. The two most common types of volcanic flows on Alba Mons are sheet flows and tube-and-channel fed flows. Sheet flows (also called tabular flows) form multiple, overlapping lobes with steep margins. The flows typically lack central channels. They are flat-topped and generally about wide on the upper flanks of the volcano but become much wider and lobate toward their downstream (distal) ends. Most appear to originate near the Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture ring, but the actual vents for the sheet flows are not visible and may have been buried by their own products. Flow thicknesses have been measured for a number of sheet flows based on MOLA data. The flows range from to thick and are generally thickest at their distal margins.Shockey, K.M.; Glaze, L.S.; Baloga, S.M. (2004). Analysis of Alba Patera Flows: A Comparison of Similarities and Differences. 35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1154. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1154.pdf. The second major type of lava flows on the flanks of Alba Mons are called tube- and channel-fed flows, or crested flows. They form long, sinuous ridges that radiate outward from the central region of the volcano. They are typically - wide. An individual ridge may have a discontinuous channel or line of pits that run along its crest. Tube- and channel-fed flows are particularly prominent on the western flank of the volcano where individual ridges can be traced for several hundred kilometers. The origin of the ridges is uncertain. They may form by successive buildup of solidified lava at the mouth of a channel or tube, with each pulse of flowing lava adding to the length of the ridge.Carr, 2006, pp. 55‚Äì56. In addition to the two main types of flows, numerous undifferentiated flows are present around Alba Mons that are either too degraded to characterize or have hybrid characteristics. Flat-topped ridges with indistinct margins and rugged surfaces, interpreted as lava flows, are common along Alba's lower flanks and become less sharp in appearance with increasing distance from the edifice. In high resolution images, many of the flows on the volcano's upper flanks originally characterized as sheet flows have central channels with levee-like ridges.Riedel, S. J.; Sakimoto, S. E. H. (2002). MOLA Topographic Constraints on Lava Tube Effusion Rates for Alba Patera, Mars. 33rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1410. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2002/pdf/1410.pdf. The morphology of lava flows can indicate properties of the lava when molten, such as its rheology and flow volume. Together, these properties can provide clues to the lava's composition and eruption rates. For example, lava tubes on Earth only form in lavas of basaltic composition. Silica-rich lavas such as andesite are too viscous for tubes to form. Early quantitative analysis of Alba's lava flows indicated that the lavas had low yield strength and viscosity and were erupted at very high rates. Alba's unusually low profile suggested to some that extremely fluid lavas were involved in the volcano's construction, perhaps komatiites, which are primitive ultramafic lavas that form at very high temperatures. However, more recent work on the tube- and channel-fed flows indicates lava viscosities within the range of typical basalts (between 100 and 1 million Pa s‚àí1).Sakimoto, S.; Crisp, J.; Baloga, S.M. (1997). Eruption constraints on Tube-Fed Planetary Lava Flows. J. Geophys. Res., 102 6597‚Äì6614. Cited in Cattermole, 2001, p. 85. Calculated flow rates are also lower than originally thought, ranging from 10 to 1.3 million m3 per second. The lower range of eruption rates for Alba Mons is within the range of the highest terrestrial volcanic flows, such as the 1984 Mauna Loa, North Queensland (McBride Province), and the Columbia River basalts. The highest range is several orders of magnitude higher than the effusive rates for any terrestrial volcano. Since the late 1980s, some researchers have suspected that Alba Mons eruptions included a significant amount of pyroclastics (and therefore explosive activity) during early phases of its development. The evidence was based on the presence of numerous valley networks on the volcano's northern flanks that appeared to be carved by running water (see below). This evidence combined with thermal inertia data, which indicated a surface dominated by fine-grained materials, suggested an easily erodible material, such as volcanic ash, was present. The volcano's extremely low profile is also more easily explained if the edifice were built largely from pyroclastic flow deposits (ignimbrites).Mouginis-Mark, P.J.; Zimbelman, J.R. (1987). Channels on Alba Patera, Mars: Evidence for Polygenic Eruptions. 18th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1346. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1987/pdf/1346.pdf.Mouginis-Mark, P.J.; Wilson, L.; Zuber, M.T. (1992). Physical Volcanology in Mars, H.H. Kieffer et al., Eds.; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, pp. 247-248, and Fig. 6. More recent data from Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have shown no specific evidence that explosive eruptions ever occurred at Alba Mons. An alternative explanation for the valley networks on the north side of the volcano is that they were produced through sapping or melting of ice-rich dust deposited during a relatively recent, Amazonian-aged glacial epoch.Carr, 2006, p. 56. In summary, current geologic analysis of Alba Mons suggests that the volcano was built by lavas with rheological properties similar to basalts. If early explosive activity happened at Alba Mons, the evidence (in the form of extensive ash deposits) is largely buried by younger basaltic lavas. Simple graben and horsts in Tantalus Fossae on eastern flank of Alba Mons. Line of pit craters suggests drainage into subsurface voids, possibly created by tension cracksCarr, 2006, p. 86, Fig. 4.6. (THEMIS IR daytime mosaic). Graben are formed by extensional stresses (red arrows) in the crust. Graben consist of flat-floored valleys bound by opposite-facing normal faults, and are often separated by upland blocks called horsts. Tectonic Features The immense system of fractures surrounding Alba Mons is perhaps the most striking feature of the volcano. The fractures are tectonic features indicating stresses in the planet's lithosphere. They form when the stresses exceed the yield strength of rock, resulting in the deformation of surface materials. Typically, this deformation is manifested as slip on faults that are recognizable in images from orbit.Banerdt, W.B.; Golombek, M.P.; Tanaka, K.L. (1992). Stress and Tectonics on Mars in Mars, H.H. Kieffer et al., Eds.; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, pp. 248‚Äì297. Alba's tectonic features are almost entirely extensional,McGovern, P.J. et al. (2001). Extension and Uplift at Alba Patera, Mars: Insights from MOLA Observations and Loading Models. J. Geophys. Res., 106(E10), 23,769‚Äì23,809. consisting of normal faults, graben and tension cracks. The most common extensional features on Alba Mons (and Mars in general) are simple graben. Graben are long, narrow troughs bound by two inward-facing normal faults that enclose a downfaulted block of crust (pictured right). Alba has perhaps the clearest display of simple graben on the entire planet.Carr, 2006, pp. 86‚Äì87. Alba's graben are up to long, and have a width on the order of ‚Äì, with depths of ‚Äì. Tension cracks (or joints) are extensional features produced when the crust is wrenched apart with no significant slippage between the separated rock masses. In theory they should appear as deep fissures with sharp V-shaped profiles, but in practice they are often difficult to distinguish from graben because their interiors rapidly fill with talus from the surrounding walls to produce relatively flat, graben- like floors. Pit crater chains (catenae), common within many graben on Alba's flanks, may be the surface manifestation of deep tension cracks into which surface material has drained. Pit craters in Cyane Fossae, as seen by HiRISE. The graben and fractures around Alba Mons (hereafter simply called faults unless otherwise indicated) occur in swarms that go by different names depending on their location with respect to Alba's center. South of the volcano is a broad region of intensely fractured terrain called Ceraunius Fossae, which consists of roughly parallel arrays of narrow, north-south oriented faults. These faults diverge around the flanks of the volcano, forming an incomplete ring about in diameter. The set of faults on Alba's western flank is called Alba Fossae and the one on the eastern flank Tantalus Fossae. North of the volcano, the faults splay outward in a northeasterly directions for distances of many hundreds of kilometers. The pattern of faults curving around Alba's flanks has been likened in appearance to the grain of a piece of wood running past a knot.Morton, 2002, p.101-102. The entire Ceraunius-Alba-Tantalus fault system is at least long and ‚Äì wide Several causes for the faults have been suggested, including regional stresses created by the Tharsis bulge, volcanic dikes, and crustal loading by Alba Mons itself. The faults of Ceraunius and Tantalus Fossae are roughly radial to the center of Tharsis and are likely a crustal response to the sagging weight of the Tharsis bulge. The faults ringing Alba's summit region may be due to a combination of loading from the Alba edifice and magma uplift or underplating from the underlying mantle. Some of the fractures are likely the surface expression of gigantic dike swarms radial to Tharsis.Okubo, C. H.; Schultz, R.A. (2005). Evidence of Tharsis-Radial Dike Intrusion in Southeast Alba Patera from MOLA-based Topography of Pit Crater Chains. 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1007. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1007.pdf. An image from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows a line of rimless pit craters in Cyane Fossae on the Alba's western flank (pictured right). The pits likely formed by the collapse of surface materials into open fractures created as magma intruded the subsurface rock to form dikes.University of Arizona HiRISE Website. http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010345_2150. Valleys and gullies High resolution view of valley network on NW flank of Alba Mons. Younger fault crosscuts the valleys. Image is about across. (Mars Global Surveyor, MOC-NA) The northern slopes of Alba Mons contain numerous branching channel systems or valley networks that superficially resemble drainage features produced on Earth by rainfall. Alba's valley networks were identified in Mariner 9 and Viking images in the 1970s, and their origin has long been a topic of Mars research. Valley networks are most common in the ancient Noachian-aged southern highlands of Mars, but also occur on the flanks of some of the large volcanoes. The valley networks on Alba Mons are Amazonian in age and thus significantly younger than the majority of those in the southern highlands. This fact presents a problem for researchers who propose that valley networks were carved by rainfall runoff during an early, warm and wet period of Martian history. If the climate conditions changed billions of years ago into today's cold and dry Mars (where rainfall is impossible), how does one explain the younger valleys on Alba Mons? Did Alba's valley networks form differently from those in the highlands, and if so, how? Why do the valleys on Alba Mons occur mainly on the northern flanks of the volcano? These questions are still being debated.See Carr, M.H. (1996). Water on Mars; Oxford University Press: Oxford, UK, pp.90‚Äì92, for a more detailed discussion. In Viking images, the resemblance of Alba's valley networks to terrestrial pluvial (rainfall) valleys is quite striking. The valley networks show a fine-textured, parallel to dendritic pattern with well-integrated tributary valleys and drainage densities comparable to those on Earth's Hawaiian volcanoes.Gulick, V.C. (2005). Revisiting Valley Development on Martian Volcanoes Using MGS and Odyssey Data. 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #2345. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2345.pdf. However, stereoscopic images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European Mars Express orbiter show that the valleys are relatively shallow ( or less) and more closely resemble rills or gullies from intermittent runoff erosion than valleys formed from sustained erosion.Ansan, V.; Mangold, N.; Masson, Ph.; Neukum, G. (2008). The Topography of Valley Networks on Mars: Comparison Between Valleys of Different Ages. 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1585. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2008/pdf/1585.pdf. It seems likely that the valleys on Alba Mons formed as a result of transient erosional processes, possibly related to snow or ice deposits melting during volcanic activity, or to short-lived periods of global climate change. (See Surface characteristics, above.) Whether the eroded material is an ice-rich dust or friable volcanic ash is still uncertain. Geologic history Lava flows with central channels on NW flank of Alba Mons. Note that the lava flows are crosscut by faults and graben, indicating that the faults are younger than the flows (THEMIS VIS). Alba's well preserved lava flows and faults provide an excellent photogeologic record of the volcano's evolution. Using crater counting and basic principles of stratigraphy, such as superposition and cross-cutting relationships, geologists have been able to reconstruct much of Alba's geologic and tectonic history. Most of the constructional volcanic activity at Alba is believed to have occurred within a relatively brief time interval (about 400 million years) of Mars history, spanning mostly the late Hesperian to very early Amazonian epochs. Faulting and graben formation in the region occurred in two early stages: one preceding and the other contemporaneous with the volcano's formation. Two late stages of graben formation occurred after volcanic activity had largely ended. Based on Viking Orbiter images, the volcanic materials related to the formation and evolution of the volcano have been grouped into the Alba Patera Formation, which consists of lower, middle, and upper members.Scott, D.H.; Tanaka, K.L. (1986). Geologic Map of the Western Equatorial Region of Mars. USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I‚Äì1802‚ÄìA. Members low in the stratigraphic sequence are older than those lying above, in accordance with Steno's law of superposition. The oldest unit (lower member) corresponds to the broad lava apron surrounding the Alba Mons edifice. This unit is characterized by sets of low, flat-topped ridges that form a radial pattern extending for hundreds of kilometers to the west, north, and northeast of the main edifice. The ridges are interpreted to be lava flows, although the flow margins are now degraded and difficult to delineate. Broad lava flows with flat-topped ridges are characteristic features of lava flood provinces on Earth (e.g., Columbia River basalt) that were formed at high eruption rates.Hooper, P. R. (1988). The Columbia River Basalt, in Continental Flood Basalts, J. D. Macdougall, Ed.; Springer: New York, pp 1‚Äì33 and Self, S.; Thordarson, T.; Keszthelyi, L. (1997). Emplacement of Continental Flood Basalt Lava Flows, in Large Igneous Provinces, J. J. Mahoney and M. F. Coffin, Eds.; AGU, Monograph 100, pp. 381‚Äì410. Cited in Ivanov and Head (2006), p. 21. Thus, the earliest phase of volcanic activity at Alba Mons probably involved massive effusive eruptions of low viscosity lavas that formed the volcano's broad, flat apron. Lava flows of the apron unit straddle the early Hesperian-late Hesperian boundary, having erupted approximately 3700 to 3500 million years ago. The middle unit, which is early Amazonian in age, makes up the flanks of the main Alba edifice and records a time of more focused effusive activity consisting of long tube- and channel-fed flows. Volcanic spreading occurred in a northward direction forming the two flanking lobes. (See Olympus Mons and Tharsis for a discussion of volcanic spreading on Mars.) Faulting and graben formation at Alba and Tantalus Fossae occurred penecontemporaneous with the lava flows. Any early explosive activity on the volcano may have occurred during the culmination of this middle phase of activity, which ended about 3400 million years ago.Ivanov and Head (2006), Fig. 32. The youngest unit, also early Amazonian, covers the summit plateau, dome, and caldera complex. This period of activity is characterized by relatively short-length sheet flows and construction of the summit dome and the large caldera. This phase ended with an eastward tilting of the summit dome, which may have initiated additional graben formation in Alba Fossae. The last volcanic features to form were the small shield and caldera at the summit. Much later, between about 1,000 and 500 million years ago, a final stage of faulting occurred that may have been related to dike emplacement and the formation of pit crater chains. Classification The classification of the Alba Mons volcano is uncertain. Some workers describe it as a shield volcano, others as a lowland pateraCattermole, 2001, p. 72 (in contrast to highland paterae, which are low-lying ancient volcanoes with furrowed ash deposits located in the southern Martian highlands), and still others consider it a one-of-a-kind volcanic structure unique to Mars. Some researchers have compared Alba Mons to coronae structures on the planet Venus.Barlow, N.G.; Zimbleman, J.R. (1988). Venusian Coronae: Comparisons to Alba Patera, Mars. 19th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Abstract #1019. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1988/pdf/1019.pdf. Alba Mons shares some characteristics with the Syrtis Major volcanic structure. (See Volcanism on Mars.) Both volcanoes are Hesperian in age, cover large areas, have very low relief, and large shallow calderas. Also like Alba, Syrtis Major displays ridged tube- and channel-fed lava flows.Woodcock, B. L.; Sakimoto, S. E. H. (2006). Lava Tube Flow: Constraints on Maximum Sustained Eruption Rates for Major Martian Volcanic Edifices. 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1992. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/1992.pdf. Because Alba Mons lies antipodal to the Hellas impact basin, a few researchers have conjectured that the volcano's formation may have been related to crustal weakening from the Hellas impact, which produced strong seismic waves that focused on the opposite side of the planet.

Brooklyn is surrounded by the Muogamarra nature reserve and occupies a strip of waterfront along the southern bank of the Hawkesbury River. The town provides a range of amenities and activities, while maintaining a quiet village atmosphere. Brooklyn provides convenient access for north shore residents and day trippers to the beautiful Hawkesbury River and Pittwater waterways for boating, swimming and fishing, and to Kur-ring-gai Chase and Muogamarra national parks for bushwalking and scenic views. Hornsby Council is currently developing a 'Brooklyn Master Plan' to provide for further improvement of the amenities in the area. The Hawkesbury River train station provides train services to the city, north shore areas, and the central coast. The Pacific Highway and the M1 Motorway are both nearby and provide easy access to the town. Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park borders the suburb to the south. Long Island runs parallel with the suburb on the opposite side of Sandbrook Inlet and is joined to Brooklyn by the railway causeway. Dangar Island is sited to the northeast. Recreation amenities and activities Visitors to the town can enjoy several caf√©s both in the town and on the waterfront with a focus on local seafood. A range of other options for meals include the Angler's Rest Hotel and the new Estuary restaurant at Kangaroo Point. The iconic 'Peat's Bite' restaurant on the Hawkesbury River is only a 10-minute boat ride from Brooklyn. Boating and fishing are major tourist attractions in Brooklyn. There are several local marinas which provide boat hire, marine services, supplies and fuel for boaties, and houseboat rental for those who want to spend a few days enjoying the river. The Hawkesbury River is also a venue for dragon boat racing and Brooklyn is home to the 'Hawkesbury River Dragons' dragon boat racing club. McKell Park is a popular spot for picnickers. It provides superb river views and multiple venues for recreation. The park encompasses the entire headland from the northern waterfront with its netted public swimming pool and children's playground, to the picnic area at Flatrock lookout, around to Parsley Bay which has a large new boat ramp, multiple pontoons for water access, a large parking area for cars with room for boat trailers and a park with barbecue facilities. Yachts are anchored here with permanent moorings and kayaks can be hired in Parsley Bay to explore the waterways. The waterfront trail around McKell park is a beautiful short walk. There is also a multi-use sporting field and children's playground near Baden Powell Hall on Brooklyn Road. The town has a vibrant art scene with a number of local artists providing works which can be viewed and purchased at the Edge Art Space on Brooklyn Road and the Redfish Cafe Gallery. Brooklyn holds its annual Spring Fair and Markets at the Brooklyn Soccer Oval in September. Brooklyn is surrounded by reserves with plenty of scope for bushwalking. The town is on the route of the famous Great North Walk, a 250 km bushwalking trail from Sydney to Newcastle. Visitors can use this trail to access excellent views within a short distance from the town. The annual Oxfam 100 km Trailwalker charity event also starts from Parsley Bay in Brooklyn. The Muogamarra Nature Reserve is open for several weeks each year during the spring wildflower season. An entry charge applies, and there are guided and unguided walks within the reserve which is closed to the public outside these times. A wide variety of very good aboriginal rock carvings can be seen here along with sections of the old Peats Ferry Road. The 'Riverboat Postman' which started its first run in 1910, takes tourists on its mail run to boat access only settlements along the Hawkesbury River and departs weekdays from the Brooklyn Public Wharf. The trip is popular with tourists and this is a great way to enjoy the river's scenery and waterways up close. Alternately you can catch the ferry to Dangar Island for a walk, a picnic, or a meal at the island cafe. The Riverboat Postman leaves Ferry Wharf in Dangar Road adjacent to the railway station on its daily run (Monday ‚Äì Friday) delivering mail and supplies to the water access only communities of Dangar Island, Wobby, Bar Point, Marlow Creek and Milsons Passage. Brooklyn Public School is the local primary (junior) school, with high school students going to either private schools (Abbotsleigh, Knox, Barker College), selective high schools (Hornsby Girls, Normanhurst Boys) or public high schools such as Asquith Girls and Asquith Boys. All these high schools are located next to the train line and are a short train journey from Brooklyn (Hawkesbury River Station). Accommodation can be found at the Brooklyn Hotel, The Anglers Rest Hotel, and on various websites. Pop culture Robert Buie headstone * Robert Buie was a local resident who fought in WW1, and his headstone in the Brooklyn cemetery credits him with shooting down Manfred von Richthofen, the German air ace who is more commonly known as the \\"Red Baron\\". * The 2005 movie Oyster Farmer was filmed in and around Brooklyn. Many local residents were employed as extras. Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 722 residents in Brooklyn. 76.6% of people were born in Australia and 86.8% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.0%, Anglican 19.4% and Catholic 16.2%. History The Hawkesbury River was named by Governor Phillip in 1789 Viewing NW over Hawkesbury River Railway Station showing moored vessels in Sandrook Inlet and Long Island (nature reserve) beyond. General view showing Hawkesbury River and densely wooded ridges in the background The general area was known as Peat's Ferry crossing for a long time until January 1884 when a plan of survey for the subdivision of land owned by Peter and William Fagan was registered with the suburb name of Brooklyn. A hotel of the same name followed later in the year. The town owes its existence and location to the main northern railway line with the railway arriving in Brooklyn in 1887 when the single track section north from Hornsby was completed. In January 1886, the Union Bridge Company from New York was awarded the contract to build a railway bridge across the Hawkesbury River. The American roots of the bridge are reflected in the name given to the construction camp, which was named after the 1883 Brooklyn suspension bridge. The town name survives to the present day.https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/Hawkesbury river rail bridge and Long Island group/history The Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge was the final link in the Eastern seaboard rail network and was a major engineering feat at the time of its construction. \\"Hawkesbury River\\" was the original platform name when the station opened in 1887 but the nomenclature varied over the following twenty years with the names \\"Flat Rock\\", \\"Brooklyn\\" and \\"Hawkesbury\\" all being used until the final change in 1906 to Hawkesbury River. Peat's Ferry Post Office opened on 1 January 1874 and was renamed Brooklyn in 1888. Brooklyn is positioned at the northern end of the Cowan Bank, a scenic stretch of steep track on a 1 in 40 grade. The line drops 200 metres from the ridgetop near Cowan to almost water level, passing through four tunnels in the process. Prior to electrification and diesel locomotives, Brooklyn was a staging post for trains heading south to Sydney with \\"push up\\" or bank engines being attached to the rear of steam trains here for extra assistance on the 8-kilometre climb to Cowan. There have been three major railway accidents in Brooklyn over the years. On 21 June 1887, an excursion train from Sydney ran out of control down the steep Cowan Bank. There were two other trains full of holidaymakers standing at the platforms at Hawkesbury River railway station and disaster was only averted by the alert station master who could hear the roaring engine and frantic whistling. He dispatched a railway porter to throw the points lever open and divert the runaway down a siding that led to the new bridge site. The train lost speed along the railway causeway out to Long Island and collided with some empty wagons. The locomotive slid off the embankment and ended up partially submerged in the river. The engine driver was trapped in the cabin and drowned but the fireman escaped. The toll was six dead and seventy injured. On 20 January 1944 the local bus stalled across the railway tracks at the level crossing in Brooklyn Road and was hit by the northbound Kempsey mail train. Seventeen people were killed. On 6 May 1990 an interurban electric train ran into the rear of the heritage steam train 3801 which had stalled climbing the Cowan Bank. Six people lost their lives. Early road traffic was conveyed across the river by George Peat's ferry and prior to the first road bridge being completed there were two vehicular ferries in operation, the \\"Frances Peat\\" and the \\"George Peat\\". The new concrete road laid down between Hornsby and Gosford had been completed by 1930 and the increased traffic was beyond the capacity of the ferries. Long queues formed on holiday weekends as vehicles awaited their turn. Work began on the first road bridge in September 1938 and it opened in May 1945. The width and depth of the river between Kangaroo Point and Mooney Mooney presented problems. The total distance to be covered was nearly 800 metres, but an embankment of fill was built out from the northern side, and the actual bridge spans only covered 580 metres. The southern foundation pier was sunk to 233 feet below high water before reaching bedrock, only short of a world record. The bridge cost A¬£190,000 to build. This was supplemented by a second road bridge, a six-lane concrete construction that was completed in 1973 as part of the Sydney to Newcastle freeway. In 1901 the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary), whilst in Australia for the inaugural opening of federal parliament, anchored their yacht the \\"Ophir\\" in Cowan Creek and boarded the paddle wheel steamboat the \\"General Gordon\\" for a tour of the lower Hawkesbury. A small obelisk unveiled in 1939, adjacent to the railway station and the avenue of tall palms in McKell Park, commemorates the discovery and naming of the Hawkesbury River by Governor Phillip in 1789.  Heritage listings  Brooklyn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Main Northern railway: Hawkesbury River railway station * Main Northern railway: Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge Commercial area The town has traditionally been associated with the farming of Sydney rock oyster with generations of the same families involved. Oyster beds are a common sight along wide sections of the river but in 2004 the disease QX wiped out production and the Industry has just recently been allowed to start up again (http://hornsby- advocate.whereilive.com.au/news/story/oyster-farmers-back-from-brink-and-now- exporting-internationally/). Transport Brooklyn Bridge carrying the Pacific Motorway (M1) on the left and the Peats Ferry Bridge carrying the Pacific Highway (B83) on the right; looking from south to north. The Hawkesbury River railway station is on the Main Northern railway line, which is served by the Central Coast & Newcastle Line. The Pacific Highway (B83) and the Pacific Motorway (M1) are major arterial roads located adjacent to Brooklyn. Access to Brooklyn via the Pacific Motorway requires exiting the motorway at on the northern shore of the Hawkesbury River and crossing the Peats Ferry Bridge via the Pacific Highway. Brooklyn is the base for Hawkesbury Cruises running The Riverboat Postman each weekday at 10:00 am, and by Brooklyn Ferry Service running the Dangar Island ferry from 6:00 am every day. Kangaroo Point The southern ends of the Pacific Motorway (M1) Brooklyn Bridge and the Pacific Highway Peats Ferry Bridge across the Hawkesbury River are located at Kangaroo Point. It has been termed \\"the entrance to Sydney\\" by those commuting from the north. The first Australian five-pound note included a picture of Kangaroo Point. In 2012 the Hornsby Shire Council undertook building work to construct viewing platforms and recreational areas.

In the mammalian retina, there are two additional categories of opsins, both involved in the formation of visual images: rhodopsin and photopsin (types I, II, and III) in the rod and cone photoreceptor cells, respectively. In humans, melanopsin is found in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). It is also found in the iris of mice and primates. Melanopsin is also found in rats, amphioxus, and other chordates. ipRGCs are photoreceptor cells which are particularly sensitive to the absorption of short-wavelength (blue) visible light and communicate information directly to the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the central \\"body clock\\", in mammals. Melanopsin plays an important non-image-forming role in the setting of circadian rhythms as well as other functions. Mutations in the Opn4 gene can lead to clinical disorders, such as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). According to one study, melanopsin has been found in eighteen sites in the human brain (outside the retinohypothalamic tract), intracellularly, in a granular pattern, in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellar cortex and several phylogenetically old regions, primarily in neuronal soma, not in nuclei. Melanopsin is also expressed in human cones. However, only 0.11% to 0.55% of human cones express melanopsin and are exclusively found in the peripheral regions of the retina. The human peripheral retina senses light at high intensities that is best explained by four different photopigment classes.  Discovery  Nerve cells containing melanopsin are shown in blue in the spread out retina. Melanopsin was first discovered by Ignacio Provencio as a novel opsin in the melanophores, or light-sensitive skin cells, of the African clawed frog in 1998. A year later, researchers found that mice without any rods or cones, the cells involved in image-forming vision, still entrained to a light-dark cycle. This observation led to the conclusion that neither rods nor cones, located in the outer retina, are necessary for circadian entrainment and that a third class of photoreceptor exists in the mammalian eye. Provencio and colleagues then found in 2000 that melanopsin is also present in mouse retina, specifically in ganglion cells, and that it mediates non-visual photoreceptive tasks. Melanopsin was found to be encoded by Opn4 with orthologs in a variety of organisms. These retinal ganglion cells were found to be innately photosensitive, since they responded to light even while isolated, and were thus named intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs). They constitute a third class of photoreceptor cells in the mammalian retina, besides the already known rods and cones, and were shown to be the principal conduit for light input to circadian photoentrainment. In fact, it was later demonstrated by Satchidananda Panda and colleagues that melanopsin pigment may be involved in entrainment of a circadian oscillator to light cycles in mammals since melanopsin was necessary for blind mice to respond to light.  Species distribution  Mammals have orthologous melanopsin genes named Opn4m, which are derived from one branch of the Opn4 family, and are approximately 50-55% conserved. However, non-mammalian vertebrates, including chickens and zebrafish, have another version of the melanopsin gene, Opn4x, which appears to have a distinct lineage that diverged from Opn4m about 360 million years ago. Mammals lost the gene Opn4x relatively early in their evolution, leading to a general reduction in photosensory capability. It is thought that this event can be explained by the fact that this occurred during the time in which nocturnal mammals were evolving.  Structure  The human melanopsin gene, opn4, is expressed in ipRGCs, which comprises only 1-2% of RGCs in the inner mammalian retina, as studied by Samer Hattar and colleagues. The gene spans approximately 11.8 kb and is mapped to the long arm of chromosome 10. The gene includes nine introns and ten exons compared to the four to seven exons typically found in other human opsins. In non-mammalian vertebrates, melanopsin is found in a wider subset of retinal cells, as well as in photosensitive structures outside the retina, such as the iris muscle of the eye, deep brain regions, the pineal gland, and the skin. Paralogs of Opn4 include OPN1LW, OPN1MW, RHO and OPN3 and were discovered by the Genome Project. Melanopsin, like all other animal opsins (e.g. rhodopsin), is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. The melanopsin protein has seven alpha helices integrated in the plasma membrane, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. It resembles invertebrate opsins far more than vertebrate photopigments, especially in its amino acid sequence and downstream signaling cascade. Like invertebrate opsins, it appears to be a photopigment with intrinsic photoisomerase activity and signals through a G-protein of the Gq family.  Function  Diagram showing a cross-section of the retina. The area near the top, labeled \\"Ganglionic layer\\", contains retinal ganglion cells, a small percentage of which contain melanopsin. Light strikes the ganglia first, the rods and cones last. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells, like rods and cones, exhibit both light and dark adaptation; they adjust their sensitivity according to the recent history of light exposure. However, while rods and cones are responsible for the reception of images, patterns, motion, and color, melanopsin-containing ipRGCs contribute to various reflexive responses of the brain and body to the presence of light. Evidence for melanopsin's physiological light detection has been tested in mice. A mouse cell line that is not normally photosensitive, Neuro-2a, is rendered light-sensitive by the addition of human melanopsin. The photoresponse is selectively sensitive to short-wavelength light (peak absorption ~479 nm), and has an intrinsic photoisomerase regeneration function that is chromatically shifted to longer wavelengths. Melanopsin photoreceptors are sensitive to a range of wavelengths and reach peak light absorption at blue light wavelengths around 480 nanometers. Other wavelengths of light activate the melanopsin signaling system with decreasing efficiency as they move away from the optimum 480 nm. For example, shorter wavelengths around 445 nm (closer to violet in the visible spectrum) are half as effective for melanopsin photoreceptor stimulation as light at 480 nm. Melanopsin in the iris of some, primarily nocturnal, mammals closes the iris when it is exposed to light. This local pupil light reflex (PLR) is absent from primates, even though their irises express melanopsin. Mechanism When light with an appropriate frequency enters the eye, it activates the melanopsin contained in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), triggering an action potential. These neuronal electrical signals travel through neuronal axons to specific brain targets, such as the center of pupillary control called the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) of the midbrain. Consequently, stimulation of melanopsin in ipRGCs mediates behavioral and physiological responses to light, such as pupil constriction and inhibition of melatonin release from the pineal gland. The ipRGCs in the mammalian retina are one terminus of the retinohypothalamic tract that projects to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is sometimes described as the brain's \\"master clock\\", as it maintains the circadian rhythm, and nerve signals from ipRGCs to the SCN entrain the internal circadian rhythm to the rising and setting of the sun. The SCN also receives input from rods and cones through the retinohypothalamic tract, so information from all three photosensitive cell types (rods, cones, and ipRGCs) in the mammalian retina are transmitted to the (SCN) SCN. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are thought to influence these targets by releasing the neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) from their axon terminals. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells also receive input from rods and cones that can add to the input to these pathways.  Effects on circadian rhythm  Melanopsin serves an important role in the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms in mammals. An organism that is photoentrained has aligned its activity to an approximately 24-hour cycle, the solar cycle on Earth. In mammals, melanopsin expressing axons target the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). In mammals, the eye is the main photosensitive organ for the transmission of light signals to the brain. However, blind humans are still able to entrain to the environmental light-dark cycle, despite having no conscious perception of the light. One study exposed subjects to bright light for a prolonged duration of time and measured their melatonin concentrations. Melatonin was not only suppressed in visually unimpaired humans, but also in blind participants, suggesting that the photic pathway used by the circadian system is functionally intact despite blindness. Therefore, physicians no longer practice enucleation of blind patients, or removal of the eyes at birth, since the eyes play a critical role in the photoentrainment of the circadian pacemaker. In mutant breeds of mice that lacked only rods, only cones, or both rods and cones, all breeds of mice still entrained to changing light stimuli in the environment, but with a limited response, suggesting that rods and cones are not necessary for circadian photoentrainment and that the mammalian eye must have another photopigment required for the regulation of the circadian clock. Melanopsin-knockout mice display reduced photoentrainment. In comparison to wild-type mice that expressed melanopsin normally, deficits in light-induced phase shifts in locomotion activity were noted in melanopsin- null mice (Opn4 -/-). These melanopsin-deficient mice did not completely lose their circadian rhythms, as they were still able to entrain to changing environmental stimuli, albeit more slowly than normal. This indicated that, although melanopsin is sufficient for entrainment, it must work in conjunction with other photopigments for normal photoentrainment activity. Triple-mutant mice that were rod-less, cone-less, and melanopsin-less display a complete loss in the circadian rhythms, so all three photopigments in these photoreceptors, rhodopsin, photopsin and melanopsin, are necessary for photoentrainment. Therefore, there is a functional redundancy between the three photopigments in the photoentrainment pathway of mammals. Deletion of only one photopigment does not eliminate the organism's ability to entrain to environmental light-dark cycles, but it does reduce the intensity of the response. Regulation Melanopsin undergoes phosphorylation on its intracellular carboxy tail as a way to deactivate its function. Compared to other opsins, melanopsin has an unusually long carboxy tail that contains 37 serine and threonine amino acid sites that could undergo phosphorylation. However, a cluster of seven amino acids are sufficient to deactivate zebrafish melanopsin. These sites are dephosphorylated when melanopsin is exposed to light and are unique from those that regulate rhodopsin. They are important for proper response to calcium ions in ipRGCs; lack of functional phosphorylation sites, particularly at serine-381 and serine-398, reduce the cell's response to light-induced calcium ion influx when voltage-gated calcium ion channels open. In terms of the gene Opn4, Dopamine (DA) is a factor in the regulation of melanopsin mRNA in ipRGCs.  Clinical significance  The discovery of the role of melanopsin in non-image forming vision has led to a growth in optogenetics. This field has shown promise in clinical applications, including the treatment of human eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and diabetes. A missense mutation in Opn4, P10L, has been implicated in 5% of patients with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This is a condition in which people experience depressive thoughts in the winter due to decreased available light. Additionally, a melanopsin based receptor has been linked to migraine pain.  Restoration of vision  There has been recent research on the role of melanopsin in optogenetic therapy for patients with the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Reintroducing functional melanopsin into the eyes of mice with retinal degeneration restores the pupillary light reflex (PLR). These same mice could also distinguish light stimuli from dark stimuli and showed increased sensitivity to room light. The higher sensitivity demonstrated by these mice shows promise for vision restoration that may be applicable to humans and human eye diseases.  Control of sleep/wake patterns  Melanopsin may aid in controlling sleep cycles and wakefulness. Tsunematsu and colleagues created transgenic mice that expressed melanopsin in hypothalamic orexin neurons. With a short 4-second pulse of blue light (guided by optical fibers), the transgenic mice could successfully transition from slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is commonly known as \\"deep sleep,\\" to long- lasting wakefulness. After switching off the blue light, the hypothalamic orexin neurons showed activity for several tens of seconds. It has been shown that rods and cones play no role in the onset of sleep by light, distinguishing them from ipRGCs and melanopsin. This provides strong evidence that there is a link between ipRGCs in humans and alertness, particularly with high frequency light (e.g. blue light). Therefore, melanopsin can be used as a therapeutic target for controlling the sleep-wake cycle.  Regulation of blood glucose levels  In a paper published by Ye and colleagues in 2011, melanopsin was utilized to create an optogenetic synthetic transcription device that was tested in a therapeutic setting to produce Fc-glucagon-like peptide 1 (Fc-GLP-1), a fusion protein that helps control blood glucose levels in mammals with Type II Diabetes. The researchers subcutaneously implanted mice with microencapsulated transgenic HEK 293 cells that were cotransfected with two vectors including the melanopsin gene and the gene of interest under an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) promoter, respectively. It is through this engineered pathway that they successfully controlled the expression of Fc-GLP-1 in doubly recessive diabetic mice and reduced hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, in these mice. This shows promise for the use of melanopsin as an optogenetic tool for the treatment of Type II diabetes.

The railway arrived in 1886 and Sir Henry Copeland, Minister of Lands, conducted a survey of the area to determine its suitability as a residential area. He named the suburb after the maiden name of his two wives, Hannah and Mary Beecroft, (two sisters he married in succession). Their names are also remembered through the respective naming of the suburb's east-west streets; Hannah Street, Copeland Road and Mary Street. Beecroft Post Office opened on 10 February 1890. Due to the strength of the temperance movement in Beecroft at that time there have never been any hotels in Beecroft.

It connects Ottawa with Montreal (via A-40), and is the backbone of the transportation system in the National Capital Region. Within Ottawa, it forms part of the Queensway west from Highway 7 to Ottawa Regional Road 174 (the Queensway continues east along the 174 to Trim Road). Highway 417 extends from the Quebec border (near Hawkesbury) to Arnprior, where it continues westward as Highway 17. Aside from the urban section through Ottawa, Highway 417 passes through farmland that dominates much of the fertile Ottawa Valley. Within Ottawa, the Queensway was built as part of a grand plan for the city between 1957 and 1966, and later reconstructed to its present form throughout the 1980s. The eastern section, from Gloucester to the Quebec border, opened in 1975 in preparation for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Sections west of Ottawa have been under construction since the mid-1970s, with the section bypassing Arnprior opening on November 29, 2012 and another 5.3 km stretch in December 2016.  Route description  Highway 417 is a controlled-access highway that traverses the lower Ottawa Valley and upper St. Lawrence Valley, bypassing the generally two-lane Highway 17 and providing a high-speed connection between Montreal and Ottawa via A-40. The freeway has also gradually been extended northwest from Ottawa alongside the old highway to its current terminus in Arnprior. Highway 417 currently has 42 interchanges from the Quebec border to Arnprior, with more planned as the highway is extended westward. Unlike other highways in Ontario and most of North America, exits are numbered from east to west. While a significant portion of Highway 417 is a rural four lane freeway divided by a grass median, the section within urban Ottawa is a busy commuter route as wide as eight lanes. The portion of the route from the Highway 7 interchange east to the Split ‚Äì a large four-way interchange between Highway 417, Ottawa Regional Road 174 and the Aviation Parkway ‚Äì is known formally as the Queensway, although no indication of this name appears on any signage.  Quebec to Ottawa  Autoroute 40 becomes Highway 417 at the Ontario border; both form the mainline of the Trans-Canada Highway. Highway 417 begins at the border between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, east of which the four lane freeway continues as Autoroute 40\\\\. The route proceeds west along the former alignment of Highway 17, which it has served to replace. It passes through a forested and agricultural landscape en route to Ottawa, serving the communities of Hawkesbury, Vankleek Hill, Casselman, Limoges and Vars. After approximately the route curves southwest while ramps provide access from the westbound lanes to Prescott and Russell County Road 17 and from County Road 17 to the eastbound lanes of Highway 417\\\\. The route later meets the southern terminus of Highway 34 at Exit 27\\\\. Continuing southwest, the route meanders along the boundary between The Nation and North Glengarry, eventually encountering the northern terminus of Highway 138‚Äîa highway built to connect Highway 417 with Highway 401 and Cornwall‚Äîeast of Casselman. At this point, the freeway enters The Nation and diverges from the boundary. After crossing a Via Rail line, the route dips south of Casselman and curves to the west at Exit 66 (County Road 7). It roughly parallels the Via Rail line several kilometres north of the freeway, though significant deviations bypass the communities of Benoit and Limoges; the latter is served by Exit 79 (County Road 5). Near Limoges is the Larose Forest, a man-made forest planted between 1928 and 1980 over the Bourget Desert, itself created as the result of clear cutting in the 19th century. At Exit 88, Highway 417 enters the city of Ottawa, though the surroundings remain unchanged until Exit 110 (Walkley Road), near Ramsayville. North of Ramsayville, the route jogs abruptly to the west as it crosses Greens Creek and enters the suburbs of Ottawa; an interchange with Innes Road divides the countryside to the south and east from the city to the north and west. The freeway merges with the Queensway at a large multi-level interchange known locally as the Split, curving to the west and into downtown Ottawa. The interchange also provides access to Aviation Parkway from westbound Highway 417 and from the parkway to eastbound Highway 417.  Queensway  Highway 417 facing east at the Split Within Ottawa, the Queensway extends from Orleans in the east and passes just south of downtown through central Ottawa to Kanata in the west. Two major interchanges anchor either end of this section: in the east, Highway 417 diverges south towards Montreal at the split, while the Queensway continues east as Ottawa Regional Road 174 and Aviation Parkway branches north; in the west, Highway 416 travels south to Highway 401\\\\. The core section of the Queensway is eight lanes wide, four per carriageway. The freeway is elevated on a berm along some central portions of the route, providing views of downtown and the Gatineau Hills to the north. This section was constructed along a former Canadian National Railway railbed. The route bisects central Ottawa with downtown and the Parliament Buildings to the north of the highway and residential neighbourhoods including the Glebe to the south. Towards the Richmond Road interchange, the original western terminus of the Queensway, both sides of the freeway are lined by residential subdivisions. Between Eagleson/March Road and Moodie Drive in the west and between Blair Road and Place d'Orl√©ans Drive in the east, a bus-only shoulder is used by OCTranspo's Transitway rapid-transit network. Several closely spaced exits serve the downtown core of Ottawa, including Nicholas Street, Bronson Avenue and Metcalfe Street; the former was once designated as various provincial highways, most recently Highway 31. Highway 417 in Ottawa near the Highway 416 interchange, showing an HOV lane in the eastbound carriageway  West of Highway 416  West of the interchange with Highway 416, the freeway enters the suburb of Kanata and travels through it in an east‚Äìwest direction. At Exit 145, the route encounters the eastern terminus of Highway 7, which travels southwest to Peterborough and Greater Toronto and provides an alternative route to Highway 401 via Highway 416\\\\. Highway 417 makes a broad 90-degree curve to the north to meet with the midpoint of the Carp Bypass at the former Highway 44 (now Ottawa Regional Road 49). The Carp Bypass was built in the mid-1960s as a bypass of the existing Highway 17, which meandered through the communities of Carp, Kinburn and Antrim; the former highway is now Donald B. Munro Drive, and lies to the east of Highway 417. The bypass was built as a two lane road with full control of access, avoiding existing properties and easily facilitating the upgrade to a freeway. North of Antrim, Highway 417 travels in a straight line parallel to old Highway 17 as far as Arnprior, where it curves to cross the Madawaska River. The divided freeway ends west of Campbell Drive, northwest of the town.  History   Queensway  Riverside Drive/Vanier Parkway) in 1961 Highway 417 was initially constructed as a connection between the existing Queensway and Autoroute 40 in Quebec, the latter being constructed in advance of Expo 1967 and opening December 17, 1966. However, the designation has since been applied to the Queensway west of the interchange between the two freeways. Construction of the Queensway was driven by the Greber Plan, which was produced by Jacques Gr√©ber under the direction of Prime Minister Mackenzie King in the late 1940s. Although Gr√©ber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, World War II halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gr√©ber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October 2, 1945 and began working almost immediately. The Greber Plan, as it came to be known, was released in 1950 and presented to the House of Commons on May 22, 1951. The plan called for the complete reorganization of Ottawa's road and rail network, and included amongst the numerous parkways was an east to west expressway along what was then a Canadian National Railway line. With the rail lines removed, construction of the new expressway got underway in 1957 when Queen Elizabeth visited Ottawa to open the first session of the 23rd Parliament. On October 15, the Queen detonated dynamite charges from the Hurdman Bridge, which now overlooks the highway as it crosses the Rideau River, and formally dedicated the new project as the Queensway. At the ceremony, premier Leslie Frost indicated that the entire project would cost C$31 million and emphasized the importance of the link to the Trans-Canada Highway. The Queensway in 1961 over Carling Avenue, following the completion of phase two The Queensway was constructed in four phases, each opening independently: phase one, from Alta Vista Drive (now Riverside Drive) east to Highway 17 (Montreal Road); phase two, from Highway 7 and Highway 15 (Richmond Road) to Carling Avenue; phase three, from Carling Avenue to O'Connor Street; and, phase four, from O'Connor Street to Alta Vista Drive, crossing the Rideau Canal and Rideau River. Phase one opened to traffic on November 25, 1960, extending up to the Rideau River. On the western side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section presented the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create grade- separations. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May 15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened, completing the Carling Avenue interchange and extending the freeway as far as Bronson Avenue. Several months later, on September 17 the short but complicated section east to O'Connor Street was opened. This left only phase four, the central section of the Queensway, which was opened in three segments. On November 26, 1965, the structures over the Rideau Canal were opened to traffic. At the same time, the westbound lanes of the Queensway were extended to Concord Street, located west of the Nicholas Street interchange. The interchange opened on January 1, 1966, allowing travel in both directions over the canal. The final segment, linking the two section of the Queensway, was placed into service on October 28, 1966. Following this, the Highway 17 designation was applied along the Queensway and the old routing renumbered as Highway 17B.  New freeway  Planning was underway on a new freeway, Highway 417, that would run east of Ottawa from the Queensway, connecting with A-40 to provide a high-speed route to Montreal. Highway 17, closely following the shore of the Ottawa River as it meanders towards Pointe- Fortune, was dangerous, narrow, and accident prone, earning it the nickname of \\"the killer strip\\". The awarding of the 1976 Summer Olympics to Montreal on May 12, 1970 resulted in an accelerated construction schedule due to the anticipated high volume of traffic that would be travelling the corridor between Ottawa and Montreal during the games. Contracts to construct the new route were opened to bidding on November 15, 1968; construction began in May 1969 starting at Base Line Road (now Ramsayville Road) and proceeding easterly. The new freeway was built under a continuous construction program over the following 6 years, opening progressively as each segment of roadway was completed. The first segment, from Ramsayville Road to Rockdale Road, near Vars, opened on September 21, 1972. By the end of that month, the easternmost of Highway 17 had been converted into a divided freeway, and construction was progressing on the remainder of the route. On October 1, 1973, a section of freeway opened between Vars and Limoges. On July 15, 1974, Minister of Transportation and Communications John Rhodes ceremonially opened the next section of Highway 417, between Limoges Road and Highland Road. The section between Highland Road and Highway 17 opened on November 8, 1974, connecting with the existing section leading from the Quebec border. The final segment of the new route, connecting the section east of Ramsayville with the Queensway, was opened to traffic on December 2, 1975. The cost of the entire eastern segment was $77 million ($ in dollars).  Extensions and expansions  Meanwhile, to the west of Ottawa, planning got underway on a continuation of the Queensway. This extension was designed to connect with the Carp Bypass ‚Äì a portion of Highway 17 designed to bypass the old meandering route (now known as Donald B. Munro Drive) through Carp, Marathon and Antrim that opened November 9, 1965 ‚Äì with an interchange and connection to Highway 7\\\\. Prior to the completion of this section of freeway, Highway 17 followed Carling Avenue and March Road from Ottawa to west of Carp. Construction began in the west end of Ottawa in 1967. On October 31, 1969, a short extension to Moodie Drive was completed, including the realignment of that road for continuity north and south of Highway 417. The following year, the freeway was extended to March Road. Construction halted at the eastern edge of Kanata for several years while a study was conducted into the merits of building the highway in a trench through the established city. During this time, construction began in 1974 on the future Queensway and Highway 7 interchange. Work also began on the two lane connections to Highway 7 as well as to the Highway 17 and Highway 44 junction west of Carp at the same time. Map of Highway 417 through Ottawa Upon the completion of the Ottawa‚ÄìQuebec section of freeway, the Queensway was designated as Highway 417 west of The Split. With the completion of the Kanata study during early 1976, work began to build the route through the city-centre in a depressed-grade; as a result all the crossings through that section pass over the freeway. By early 1978, the western extension was opened to traffic, providing four lanes between Richmond Road and Highway 7 / 417\\\\. The two legs beyond the interchange were initially constructed as two-lane undivided roads, and remained as such for over a decade. Throughout the 1980s, work on Highway 417 shifted from extensions to expansions. Within Ottawa, the initially four lane route, separated by a wide grass median, was expanded to eight lanes with paved shoulders and centre-mounted lighting beginning in 1982. To reduce weaving, the exit at Kent Street was removed during this work. Expansion of the two lane Highway 17 west of the interchange with Highway 7 got underway in 1991; this section was renumbered as Highway 417 as construction progressed westward. The construction saw a second two lane roadway built parallel to the existing route to create a divided freeway, a process known as twinning. When the twinning of Highway 17 reached March Road, new contracts were tendered to continue the process northward. Bot Construction was awarded the contract for the section north to Panmure Road on December 9, 1998. On February 16, 2000, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) officially announced that Highway 417 would be extended to Arnprior over the next several years. A contract to build the freeway from north of Panmure Road to south of Arnprior was tendered in early 2002. This work was completed and the extension opened to traffic on September 24, 2004. Concurrent with the twinning of Highway 7 between Carleton Place and Ottawa, the interchange with Highway 417 was upgraded to support the divided traffic flows; a new flyover ramp was built connecting westbound Highway 417 with westbound Highway 7\\\\. Construction began on August 22, 2006, and was opened in June 2008 along with the Highway 7 expansion. Construction to twin the Arnprior Bypass portion of Highway 17, which included a new interchange at White Lake Road, began during the spring of 2009. The bypass was originally built in 1981 as one of a number of upgrades to Highway 17 between Ottawa and North Bay. It was intended for directing through traffic around downtown Arnprior and was designed for an eventual upgrade to a divided freeway. The major structure in this project was a second crossing of the Madawaska River. Work was completed in late 2012; the new section was opened ceremonially on November 29 and cost $63 million, $7 million less than projected. Highway 417 was widened from 4 lanes to 8 lanes between Eagleson Road/March Road in Kanata and Palladium Drive (including HOV lanes), and from 4 lanes to 6 lanes between Carp Road and Highway 7. The work on the westbound lanes was completed in late-October 2014, with the eastbound lanes completed in mid-November 2014. Highway 417 was also expanded to 8 lanes between Moodie Drive and Eagleson Road/March Road to relieve congestion, especially when events occur at Canadian Tire Centre, and between Nicholas Street and Ottawa Road 174, construction of which began in 2013 and completed on-time in 2015. The additional pair of lanes were used as bus lanes temporarily, until 2018, at which point they became general traffic lanes.  Future  New grade separation that now carries traffic over Campbell Drive under construction in August, 2015 The MTO plans to further extend Highway 417 westerly through the Ottawa Valley by twinning and realigning the existing route to a four-lane freeway beyond Arnprior, where it currently merges into a two-laned Highway 17. Route planning has been completed to Pembroke, with a bypass to the east of the Cobden area. The second phase of the extension to be built (phase 1 was the section around Arnprior) is a extension past Campbell Drive to Scheel Drive northwest of Arnprior, under construction and completed in 2016. Phases 3 and 4 total and will take the 417 from Scheel Drive to a point 3 kilometres (2 mi) west of Bruce Street (Town of Renfrew). The design stage of this phase was announced in August 2017. Planning and construction efforts to upgrade Highway 17 through Sudbury and east of North Bay have prompted speculation that Highway 417 will continue to be extended west through Northern Ontario; although no comprehensive conversion plan has been announced to date, Sault Ste. Marie MPP David Orazietti has spearheaded a petition to have the entire highway four-laned from Arnprior to Sault Ste. Marie, similar to the campaign previously undertaken by his caucus colleague Rick Bartolucci regarding the extension of Highway 400. Cheryl Gallant, the federal Member of Parliament for Renfrew‚ÄîNipissing‚ÄîPembroke, has also advocated the four-laning of the highway through the Ottawa Valley toward North Bay, and ultimately the entire length of the highway throughout Northern Ontario.

It is part of the Riau Islands province, the capital of which, Tanjung Pinang, lies in the island's south and is the island's main community. Bintan's land area is (total area is including 96% sea area). Its administrative region is designated the Bintan Regency, one of the six administrative regencies of the Riau Islands province. The city of Tanjung Pinang is an autonomous area geographically within Bintan Island but not included in the Regency. Bintan's history is traced to the early 3rd century. The island flourished as a trading post on the route between China and India, and over the centuries it came under the control of the Chinese, the British, and then the Dutch when it was declared part of the Dutch East Indies through the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. In the 12th century, the Bintan island in the Strait of Malacca was known as the \\"Pirate Island\\" since the Malay pirates used to loot trading ships sailing in these waters. Singapore, the closest major city, is a 45-50 minute trip by motorised catamaran across the Singapore Strait from Bintan Resort area in the northwest of the island. The island has beaches with beach-front hotels and resorts; the most prominent of these beaches is the Bintan Resorts set over an area of of tropical environment. The archipelago of the Riau islands is right opposite to this resort across the South China Sea. Indonesia is promoting Bintan as the next best tourist destination after Bali. History Tanjung Pinang in Bintan On account of Bintan Island's strategic location and size on the India-China trade route, it has a rich history. Along with the local ethnic Malays and the Bugis, domination by the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Arabs, and the British at different times has been a part of Bintan's rich history. Many local internal feuds between the Malays and Bugis, and battles in the sea, with and between foreign invasion forces, have been part of Bintan's history and its straits. From the mid-16th century, the Sultan of Johor-Riau kingdom had moved their kingdom between Johor, Riau and Lingga. The earliest history of Bintan is linked to the history of Nagoya Hills, which is integral with Batam, near Bintan island and other islands of the Riau archipelago. The Chinese chronicles have mentioned that Batam was inhabited by 231 AD when Singapore island was still called Pulau Ujung (Ujung Island). Bintan came under the control of the Malacca kingdom from the 13th century. Later, the Sultan of Johor ruled from here and his reign lasted till the 18th century. Riau Islands were central to the greater Malay kingdoms or Sultanates, known as the 'Malay World', which had its control from eastern Sumatra to Borneo. For centuries, Riau was the home of Malay and Orang Laut people. They had settled in Bintan. These two communities were the backbone of most Malay kingdoms from the time of Srivijaya to the Sultanate of Johor. They had full control of trade routes going through the straits. Migrants from China and Indo-China, though came here later, settled in large area of Asia. After the fall of Melaka in 1511, Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor ‚Äì Riau, based on Bintan island. They were considered the centre of Malay culture. From the 12th to 13th centuries, the Srivijaya Empire of Sumatra held sway over Bintan island. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of Palembang had visited Riau Islands in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him and made a strategic alliance. They moved with a \\"flotilla of 800 vessels to Bintan\\" where Sri Tri Buana became the king. However, Bintan and its straits got the reputation as a pirate island due to the Malay pirates who seized many ships by forcing them to the port to trade and or loot the cargo carried by them. Hundreds of ships of Malays forced Chinese ships returning from the Indian Ocean to their ports in Bintan. Those who resisted were attacked. Large quantities of Chinese ceramics were recovered on Bintan, some traced to the early Song dynasty (960‚Äì1127). The Arabian chronicler, Ibn Battuta, writing on the Riau islands in the 13th century states: \\"Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them.\\" Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, Bintan is still referred by many by the epithet \\"Pirate Island\\". According to historical records, Sri Tri Bhuvana occupied Singapore and then declared himself as the King of Singapore. Before that he renamed Temasek, the island he had occupied, as Singapore. Another explanation mooted to the naming of Singapore is that the king spotted an animal, which he presumed to be a lion, and hence called Temasek as Singapore (Lion City). The reign of Srivijaya empire lasted till the 16th century. In the year 1521, the Portuguese who were on pepper hunt, had the intention of building strongholds in the form of forts during their sea voyages in the East, on Sunda Island in Java after they had received instructions from their King to destroy four forts in India, Sri Lanka and Sumatra. However, they initially failed to capture Bentan, the stronghold of the former Sultan of Malaca on the south east of the Singapore Strait and Atjeh (the capital of a new Sultanate, which was emerging in North Sumatra). At this time, they were successful in establishing a fort at Pasai though were unsuccessful in establishing a fortress at Canton in China and suffered defeat at the hands of the Chinese. In 1524, Malays of Bintan attacked Malacca, which was under the control of the Portuguese. Bintan first became politically important when Sultan Mahmud of the fallen Sultanate of Malacca fled to Bintan and created a resistance base there after Malacca was taken by the Portuguese forces in 1511. The Portuguese eventually destroyed the stronghold in 1526, and after a few years the Sultanate founded a new capital back on the Malay Peninsula and developed from there. Bintan agro beach resort At the beginning of the 18th century the Sultanate of Johor entered into political turmoil and the capital moved back to Bintan as the Bugis took control of the Sultanate. At the hands of the Bugis, Bintan became a powerful trading port, attracting regional, Western, Indian and Chinese traders as well as migrants including Chinese much in the same way Malacca had developed into a regional power three centuries earlier. Penyengat Island in Bintan European powers wanted to take control of the port, which had a flourishing trade. During this period the British, who controlled Penang, were aggressively looking towards expanding their control to the south of the Straits of Malacca, as they wished to contain the Dutch expansions. They considered Bintan as a possible location. During this period the Dutch had defeated the Bintan rulers and taken control of the island by the end of the 18th century; this had brought to an end the local trading supremacy. This also resulted in checkmating the British ambition to occupy the area. However, an internal power struggle within the Sultanate of Riau-Johor ensued. The British seized this opportunity and occupied the island of Singapore. With this, the importance of Bintan island as a trading port also declined. A new cultural centre developed on Penyengat Island and it got established as the stronghold of Malay and Islamic culture. However the history changed the fate of Riau as a political, cultural or economic centre when European powers took control of the regional trade routes by taking advantage of political weaknesses within the Sultanate. Singapore Island, that had been for centuries part of the same greater Malay kingdoms and sultanates, and under direct control of Sultan of Johor, came under British control. The creation of a European-controlled territory in Johor-Riau heart broke the sultanate into two parts, destroying the cultural and political unity that had existed for centuries. The Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824 consolidated this separation, with the British controlling all territories north of the Singapore Strait and Dutch controlling territories from Riau to Java. Till the independence of Indonesia in 1945, Bintan was under the control of the Netherlands East Indies. However, the Riau Archipelago remained a fairly borderless territory till recently. During the World War II Japanese had occupied the Malay world and Singapore was their headquarters. During this period, many Malays including the upper strata of society had to join the Imperial Army. After the war, from 1950 the Archipelago was a duty-free zone till the revolution Konfrontasi in 1963. During this period, the Straight dollar of British Malaya was the principal currency. Visa free movement of people, which existed then is now no more prevalent.Nordholt, pp. 447‚Äì448 Geography and climate Bintan, is the largest among the 3,200 islands of Riau Archipelago and is located east of the Batam Island. It has a coast line of and has rolling topography in its landform. The Riau Islands are a province of Indonesia, which encompassed the Riau Archipelago, Natuna Islands, Anambas, and Lingga Islands; in July 2004 the islands of Riau were divided from the existing Riau Province to form the new province with its capital at Tanjung Pinang. The archipelagos of Anambas and Natuna, located between mainland Malaysia and Borneo, are now part of this province Map of Bintan In the Tanjung Pinang city, the low tide reach or the mud flat part was built with stilts and were mosquito and rat infested. Above these mud flat reaches, narrow piers or pelantars were built at higher elevations and the old city of Tanjung expanded with a maze of streets and alleys. The old pier with the name Pelantar II thrives as the fish market. The town has a large population of the Chinese, whose presence is seen around three Buddhist Pagodas with the 'Citiya Bodhi Sasana' overlooking the ocean at the end of Pelantar II pier. The Indonesian sea route through the Bintan straits has been considered very safe for sailing of small freighters. The island has developed over the centuries in two distinct zones, namely, the southern and the northern zones, which are clearly differentiated from the prevalent life styles of people living there. The highest hill on the island is Bintan Besar, which is in height and has thick forest cover. It is formed by old volcanic eruptions. The summit of this peak can be reached through a forest track and the climb takes about 3 hours. The top of this peak provides a panoramic view of Bintan. It is approached from a hamlet at the foot of the hill, known as Kampung Sekuning, which is from Tanjung Pinang. Despite being larger than Batam, it is less populated. Bintan ferry terminal Several daily ferries run between Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal of Singapore to the Bandar Bentan Telani Ferry Terminal on the northern part of the Island in Bintan resorts and also at the Sri Bintan Pura Ferry Terminal at Tanjung Pinang, the capital of the Indonesian province of Riau Islands covering a distance of in about 45 minutes. The airport is domestic only (no international flights) - Bintan's Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport (IATA: TNJ, ICAO: WIDN). Bintan is very close to the Equator. Hence, tropical climate is dominant all through the year with two distinct seasons namely the northeast monsoon from November to March and a dry southwest monsoon from June to October with the annual rainfall precipitation incidence varying in the range . The island has an \\"insular character\\" with a constant temperature averaging at . The temperatures reported vary between and . March to early November is the dry and the quiet season with clear sunny days. Winter season lasts from late November to March. Demographics Though a large island compared to all other islands in the Riao archipelago, it is sparsely populated. As the Dutch ruled over the islands for a long period, their influence is distinctly discerned in the island. Population of Bintan Island is about 400,000 with the citizens mostly belonging to the Malay, Bugis, Chinese and the Orang Laut ethnicity. An observation made on the distribution of different ethnic groups in Bintan is that Indonesians have migrated in large numbers to the island and as result Malays, the original settlers of the region, are now a minority in Riau Archipelago as a whole. This is attributed to the fact that the island is close to Malaysia and Singapore in particular and Indonesians flock to the place to get a foothold to go to Singapore. In the capital city of Tanjung Pinang, the urban population had jumped from 98,871 in 1998 to 134,940 in 2004, and by 2014 had reached 226,716. Economy and development Bintan Agro Beach Resort In 1824, the Treaty of London finally settled that the islands south of Singapore are Dutch Territories. Bintan was again under the control of the Dutch. Bintan's power and central role disappeared with the regional political changes and the island's past fortune was now overshadowed by neighbouring Batam and Singapore. Following its founding by the British in 1819, Singapore became a new regional trading centre. Due to its limited size, Singapore initiated the Sijori Growth Triangle in 1980 and 1990s, and signed agreements with the Indonesian government to invest in Batam and Bintan.Peachey, pp.9, 14, 17 The economy of Bintan island is centred on tourism, given its close proximity to Singapore. In the year 1990, according to a Presidential Decree (25 July 1990), a coordinating team was set up for the Riao Province Development with the mandate to plan and develop development projects within the framework of Indonesia-Singapore cooperation. Investment plans, similar to that of Batam, were evolved with basic intention to provide leisure space to Singaporeans on the white beaches of Bintan and this approach also conformed to the Indonesian Policy of declaring the 1990s as the \\"decade of Visit Indonesia\\". In 1991, Bintan Management Resort for establishing a resort with intent to develop resorts, industrial parks and water projects was planned. In December 1994, partial opening of Bintan Resort Development was agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by trade ministers of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As per the Master Plan prepared for Bintan, the emphasis was on tourism, industrial projects and agricultural products, all under private-sector initiative, involving formation of a consortium of the Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation, Wah Chang International (whose specialisation is development of resorts), the Keppel group and the local banks. Thus, the once wild and deserted Bintan island has now become an industrial \\"hinterland\\" for Singapore and a special investment zone for world industrial companies, also attracting thousands of workers from the entire country. This industrial estate agreement is in partnership with Batamlndo Industrial Park. The Bintan industrial estate has been allotted and is designed as a \\"One-stop investment centre\\" providing all services essential for the investing companies to devote exclusively towards production. It targets industries such as textiles, garments and wood processing, unlike the Batam industrial estates. This functions as a supplement to Singapore's economy by way of manufacturing low-value goods here.Peachey, p.18 Earlier, Singapore's Batam Industrial Park had signed an agreement with Indonesia to lease its northern coast and develop it into a resort (\\"Bintan Resort\\") for Singaporeans. An area of had been allocated to this project, which was further divided to 20‚Äì30 projects ‚Äì for hotels and resorts and sports facilities. Further, the Bintan Lagoon and Beach Resorts, designed exclusively for wealthy tourists, have been planned with \\"two 18-hole championship golf courses with superlative accommodation\\". This resort area has an exclusive approach from Singapore that bypasses the capital city. It has modern facilities of museums, handicraft shops, artists' villages and other eco-tourism related attractions. The agribusiness venture planned under the Master Plan for Bintan envisages pig rearing for export to Singapore and seafood processing plants. Fishery cultivation of grouper fish, Napoleon, kakap and bream are also planned in the island. Under the industrial sector, the identified fields for development are mining of Bauxite (Bauxite reserve is 15.88 million tons), kaolin, granite, white sand and tin. The government of Indonesia has also planned the petroleum industry with its subsidiary industry of manufacture of plastics in Bintan. Bintan Eco-Tourism Venture Project has been launched to generate better income avenues for the low-income families. The eco-tourism destinations identified are all within approachable distances that could be covered in about 30 to 90 minutes from the starting point by car. Village handicrafts made from the local pandanus plants are a popular attraction during the eco-tour to villages in Bintan. Private operators are meanwhile succeeding in putting Bintan on the world map for Eco-tourism, with both Nikoi and LooLa Adventure Resort being amongst the four finalists of WildAsia's highly respected 2012 award for \\"Asia's most inspiring responsible tourism operators\\", which LooLa went on to win. LooLa furthermore is one of three finalists in the 2013 WTTC's \\"Tourism for tomorrow, community benefits\\" awards. In 2016, newly opened Cempedak cemented the island's aspirations as a sustainability hero by winning the award for Sustainable Design in the HICAP 2017 Sustainable Hotel Awards. The Integrated resort management is highly dependent on the International tourism industry. Tourist footfalls, as recorded till 2016, have been reported to be on the increase and reached over 600,000 just to the Bintan Resorts area. Thus, the massive and ambitious economic development plan envisaging \\"10 golf courses, 20 hotels, 10 condominiums, three village clusters, a township, several marine and eco-tourism attractions\\" launched in 1995 with a gestation period of 20 years, was according to the leisure industry analyst of Singapore: \\"Bintan has better prospects because of the people behind its development. They are big names who will have to maintain their reputation.Murray, p.49 But there have been some delays in the construction of the Bintan Lagoi residential area. In 2016, over 600,000 tourists visited Bintan Island and most of them came from Singapore, Korea and Japan. 75 percent of foreign tourists came by ferry from Singapore, while domestic tourists mainly came by airplanes to the recently opened Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport 35 minutes from Bintan Resort, whereas the current Tanjung Pinang airport is 90 minutes away. Water resources Water resources of the Bintan have been exclusively planned by identifying an area of for the purpose which also includes the catchment of the water source and its forest areas. Infrastructure Main road leading to Bintan Resort To meet the large developmental programme launched for the Bintan island, creation of modern infrastructure facilities began in 1991 itself with an investment of US $170 million. Since the island was approachable only by ferrying, priority was given to develop the Ferry terminal at Bandar Bentan Telani. There are now three Ferry Terminals (Sea Ports) and two Cargo Sea Ports with capacity of 10,000 to 12000 gross weight ton. Bintan now has an airport known as Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport.Gossling, p.271 Garuda Indonesia has plans to build a new airport hub on the island as a stop gap measure for Jakarta, and to compete with Lion Air's new hub at Hang Nadim Airport on neighboring Batam. One issue however is the region is saturated with airport capacity while land is scarce, as Singapore Changi Airport and Johor Bahru Senai Airport are nearby. Road within the island was also started and the first stretch of the , the east west arterial road was completed (out of the stretch planned in the ultimate stage). Branch roads were also built to land parcels allotted for resort development. Within each land area allocated, the resort agencies constructed their own internal road network. Drinking water facilities were also created by constructing a reservoir of 5 million litres and a service reservoir of 1.5 million litres for supply to a water treatment plant. From this plant, potable water supply system has been created to all the resort areas. Electricity supply is also ensured through a Power generating plant of 18 MW plant with capacity to upgrade to 24 MW. Within each resort area water and power supply connections to the resorts are done by the resort agencies. The potable water that is supplied meets the WHO standards. Sewage Treatment is done in all the resorts through modular Sewage treatment plants. The recycled effluent is put to use for irrigation. Another important civic amenity attended is the disposal of solid waste. The solid waste is collected from the resorts. It is systematically disposed in a centralized sanitary landfill site.Gossling, p.271 There are 15 banks, 7 hotels and 6 golf courses. Telecommunication Service facility available is the International Net Work. Flora and fauna Flora In Bintan, the primary forest cover was in a limited area on the hills. There was extensive deforestation done mostly for the cultivation of gambier (Uncaria gembieri). The plantation size of each gambier plantation was . For processing of gambier leaves firewood was essential. This requirement was met by cutting forests of as much as the sized gambier plantations. With this amount of forest degradation, the gambier processing could be sustained for 12 years only. Forest was not available for use for the processing, and production of gambier was discontinued, while efforts continued to find new stocks of firewood. Inevitably, Gambier was totally abandoned. In the 20th century rubber plantation replaced gambier. Even the rubber plantations were abandoned due to water logging problems. Now, on the higher reaches of the hills secondary forests have developed in those areas where water logging is not prevalent. The abandoned land is also now put to other uses. In the rain forests of the island on the trek to the Gunung Bintan peak, now vegetation consists of tall trees of dipterocarp (which bears two winged fruits) and many other plants. Fauna Silver leaf monkeys Various species of sea animals and plants are found underwater. From squids to snails, from various fish to oyster ‚Äì several marine species including sea turtles are found here. Dolphins are also sighted. The variety and diversity of sea life is very attractive. Wild animals seen on this forest trek are silver leaf monkeys, sunbirds, eagles and kites. Hawksbill turtle Green turtle ;Sea turtles Sea turtles, in particular, are the special species of Indonesia and its many islands, including Bintan; six species out of seven found in the world are recorded in Indonesia. The Indonesian law protection Act. no. 5 1990 re Conservation of Nature Resource and its Ecosystem; Government Regulation no. 7 1990 re Conservation Species of Flora & Fauna and the international trade by CITES (Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species) provide protection to these species. Bintan Island was one of the locations where turtles were found in large numbers; in the 1950s, during the nesting season, at least 2 nests used to be found every day on the coastline of Bintan Resorts. Now, the nests are not found as frequently as in the past. Turtle tracks, nests, eggs, and egg shells have been recorded during patrol surveys conducted during specified periods, not only in Bintan but also in the Pasir Pasan beach. In the Bintan Resort's nestling beaches hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have been recorded. Research and Development Department and Environmental & Health Division of Bintan Resort are encouraged by their patrolling efforts and they are confident that sea turtle nests would be protected on Bintan and also conserved in local villages. Historical places At Bintan and in its close vicinity of its capital city of Tanjung Pinang, there are a number of historical monuments linked to its ancient history and modern developments. Its closeness to Singapore has resulted in development of beaches as popular resorts with hotels and other paraphernalia to attract tourists. Some of the well-known sites of attractions are the Penyengat, Tanjung Pinang city, Raja Ali Haji Monument, the Colonial Graveyard, Chinese Pagodas, Banyan Tree Temple, and its many beaches and resorts. Natural Maritime Culture is also part of the historical nature's heritage of mangroves, many species of animals and birds and the rich and exotic maritime nature of the sea life. Penyengat Penyengat is a historical small island (about in area) located about offshore of Tanjung Pinang, which was a religious, cultural and administrative centre of the region in the 19th century of the Riao-Johor sultanate. The Sultan had shifted to this place after Melaka was taken over by the Portuguese and he made it the capital of his kingdom, which was in decline at the time. On the northeast end of the island many ancient Islamic relics are seen. The Malay and the Bugis, to attain peace in the region, had cemented their relationship by establishing marital ties. Raja Ali Haji, who was the Bugis commander of Bintan and acclaimed as the hero of his people, married his daughter to Sultan Mahmud Shah of Malacca. The island was gifted to his daughter, Raja Hamidah. This union established peace between the Malay and the Bugis. Following this, a grand mosque (see infobox) called the Masjid Raya was built on the island (over 170 years old), which can be seen from Tanjung Pinang. A monument by the seaside that commemorates Raja Ali Haji, who sacrificed his life for his people against the Dutch, is also seen on the beach. Hakka ethnic people and Indo-Malays reside here. Another historical fact is that in 1819 the Penyangat-based sultanate cooperated with Sir Stamford Raffles to handover Singapore in exchange for British Military protection. ;Masjid Raya Sultan Riau Mosque in Tanjung Pinang, the capital city of the province of Riau Islands. Masjid Raya Sultan Riau built in 1818, is an exquisitely kept yellow mosque, also called the sulfur-coloured mosque. It has many domes and minarets. The unique feature of the mosque is that the mortar used was the special egg-white mortar as the cementing material; eggs were presented to the Sultan by his subjects on the occasion of his wedding. The mosque houses a rare 150-year-old hand written Koran in its Islamic library. A formal dress code is observed for entry into the mosque. Tanjung Pinang Boat race in Tanjung Pinang Tanjung Pinang is located on the southwestern part of Bintan island and is the capital and largest town of the Indonesian province of Riau Islands. It is a port town and a trade centre with ethnic diversity and with traditional villages and temples. It has an area of and is an autonomous region within the Bintan Island. It is a trading port between islands in the Riau archipelago. Tanjung Pinang has ferry and speedboat connections to Batam, Singapore, and Johor Bahru. The city is the backyard for the Singaporeans to get away from their sanitized city to indulge in a spot of anarchy In the central commercial district there is a small Chinese temple in the interior of the old town at Lorong Gambir II, called the Cetiya Satya Dharma. Senggarang near Tanjung Pinang Within the town of Tanjung Pinang, there is a Dutch Colonial Graveyard (mostly in ruins), which reflects the life of the seamen (Europeans) in the old days. The town also has a museum at the crossing of the Jalan Kamboja road with Jalan Bakar batu. The museum has display of many eccentric historical artifacts, ceramics, kris and guns. It is a culturally happening place with cultural centres for stage performances of Malay music and dance festivals. Renowned Buddhist temples are located outside central Tanjung Pinang in a small town named Senggarang. A Palace and royal tombs, among them the grave of the Raja Ali Haji's and also tombs of other royals, are located here. The old ruler was the creator and author of the first Malay Language grammar book, which is a rich legacy of the Riau sultanate. Another vintage site of interest is the \\"Old Stilt\\" village (in the mud flat low tide region near the jetties), known as \\"Tanjung Pinang's Kampung ayer or Kampung Bugis\\". Raja Haji Fisabilillah Monument ;Raja Haji Fisabillah Monument Raja Haji Fisabilillah died during the battle of Malacca against the Dutch in 1784. A 28-metre tall Monument was erected in his memory as the national hero of Bintan. He was a famous Malayan king and had his palace (istana) on the island Penyengat, off Tanjung Pinang. This monument is being considered to be put on the World Heritage list of sites which have \\"outstanding universal value\\" to the world. Banyan Tree Temple Banyan Tree Temple, a temple about 100 years old, is visited by the local Chinese community and Singaporeans. It is located in Senggarang town. Apart from this temple, there are several Chinese Pagodas in Singgarang near the jetty. One temple is in ruins and the other three temples, each about 100 years old, are located within a courtyard facing the sea. The interior of these temples depicts colourful paintings and wood carvings. Chinese devotees from Singapore are seen around these temples offering prayers. Beaches and resorts Sampat beach The Trikora group of beaches is situated on the easternside of Bintan and are numbered from 1 to 4 from south to north. The approach road from the capital city is to its northeast and passes through a locals town called Kangka Kawal and a picturesque fishing town called Teluk Kawal.Eliot, p.222-223 Bintan Resorts, located at the northern part of Bintan is delimited between and and covers an area of . Many of the resorts are Internationally (eg. ClubMed) or Singaporean owned as the island is marketed to Singaporeans for whom Bintan is a short ferry trip away, an easy weekend trip and a golf mecca with prices significantly cheaper than in Singapore. There are many other resorts around the main island of Bintan in private islands that can be booked as a unit for groups or individually. Hotels and shops are priced in Singapore or US dollars at similar prices you would pay in Singapore.

As part of the project, the second tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam in the world would be built. It is planned to generate 2,400 megawatts (MW) of electricity once completed. The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity. However, most of this demand is said to lie in Peninsular Malaysia and not East Malaysia, where the dam is located. Even in Peninsular Malaysia, however, there is an oversupply of electricity, with Tenaga Nasional Berhad being locked into unfavourable purchasing agreements with Independent Power Producers. The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to Peninsular Malaysia. This plan envisioned 730 km of overhead HVDC transmission lines in East Malaysia, 670 km of undersea HVDC cable and 300 km of HVDC transmission line in Peninsular Malaysia. Future plans for the dam include connecting it to an envisioned Trans-Borneo Power Grid Interconnection, which would be a grid to supply power to Sarawak, Sabah, Brunei, and Kalimantan (Indonesia). There have been mentions of this grid made within ASEAN meetings but no actions have been taken by any party. Bakun Dam came online on 6 August 2011. As of 2015, Bakun Dam is the biggest dam in Southeast Asia. On 16 August 2017, Sarawak Energy completes acquisition of Bakun HEP from Federal Government. Under the deal, the Sarawak government will pay Putrajaya RM2.5 billion and take over the remaining RM6.4 billion remaining debts. Prime Minister Najib Razak handed over the dam to the Sarawak government on 5 April 2018.  Project history   First attempt  Initial survey was conducted in the early 1960s and more studies were conducted in the early 1980s. The studies cover the masterplan and feasibility report, rock and soil studies, hydro potential, detailed design and costing, environmental and socio-economic studies and HVDC transmission studies. Notable consultants involved were SAMA Consortium German Agency for Technical Cooperation, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and Maeda-Okumura Joint Venture, Fichtner and Swedpower Swedish Agency for Technical Cooperation. Although the project was first approved by government in 1986, it was shelved in 1990 owing to decreased projection of electricity demand due to the recession of 1985 and the decision to use the then low-cost alternative of natural gas as fuel for developing the petrochemical industry.  Second attempt  It was revived in September 1993 by the Malaysian Federal Government led by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In January 1994, a privatised contract was awarded to Ekran Berhad. In April 1995, Ekran completed the EIA of the project. The project was to cost US$2.4 billion and was originally scheduled for completion in 2003. The dam was to be built beginning in 1994 by a privatised joint-venture consortium called Bakun Hydroelectric Corporation, comprising Ekran Berhad, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), the government of Sarawak, Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (Sesco), and Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd (MMC). Ekran awarded the electromechanical works and the transmission portion to ABB. ABB's consortium partner for the civil works will be Companhia Brasileira de Projetos e Obras (CBPO) of Brazil, a large civil engineering company belonging to the Odebrecht Group, responsible for the construction of the dam and power house. Engineering consulting firms involved in the project then were TNB Hydro, a subsidiary of Tenaga Nasional Berhad and KLIA Consult. Ekran launched a rights issue to finance the building of the dam, but it was undersubscribed and Ting Pek Khing (Ekran's chairman) had to put up $500 million to take up the unsubscribed portion as part of his agreement with the underwriters. Ekran was a company of Ting Pek Khing, himself a timber businessman. Neither he nor his company had built a dam before. The entire project was not tendered publicly, and instead was awarded by government contract. The project was halted in 1997 in the face of the Asian financial crisis. When the project was shelved, the Malaysian government took back the project from this consortium. By this time, RM1.6 billion had already been paid out by the government. RM700 million to RM1.1 billion was paid as 'compensation' to Ekran, according to figures disclosed in Parliament. The completed works were the river diversion tunnels by Dong Ah of Korea for RM400 million, and to Global Upline for work completed on the auxiliary cofferdams for RM60 million. Other works are for selective clearing of biomass, and relocation of the affected native residents. The government had also turned over RM1 billion for the purchase of eight turbines.  Third attempt  In May 2000 it was revived through a 100% government-owned company, Sarawak Hidro, but the transmission of power to Peninsular Malaysia was not part of the revived project. The construction work was tendered out as a turnkey contract. The completion date has been revised to February 2008. The new civil builder is the Malaysia‚ÄìChina Hydro JV consortium, led by Sime Engineering Berhad of Malaysia (a subsidiary of Sime Darby and Sinohydro Corporation of China. Other members of the consortium are WCT Berhad, MTD Capital, Ahmad Zaki Resources, Syarikat Ismail and Edward & Sons. It targeted a completion date of September 2007. The total sum to be paid to this consortium was budgeted at RM1.8 billion. The electromechanical works for the turbines were awarded in two contracts to IMPSA of Argentina and Alstom of France. In 2004, engineering consulting firm JR Knowles, was hired to study the delays in construction. Other engineering consulting firms involved in the project were Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation, of Australia and Opus International Malaysia.  Items of temporary interest during third attempt  In May 2004 Ting Pek Khing's name again was raised in connection with the project. A Ting-owned company, Global Upline, was rumoured to have been awarded a contract to undertake \\"biomass removal\\" in the flood basin. This would allow him to harvest timber in the area without a separate permit. Issuance of timber permits has come under increased scrutiny due to political conditions and environmental concerns. However, as of December 2006 it has not been awarded. Usage of the generated capacity was to have been by a proposed aluminium smelting plant in Similajau, near Bintulu, approximately 180 km inland from the dam.B. K. Sidhu. \\"US$1b JV smelter for Sarawak\\"The Star Online. 10 February 2011 The project is a joint venture between Dubai Aluminum Co, Ltd (Dubal) and Gulf International Investment Group (GIIG), an investment fund jointly set up by Malaysian tycoon Syed Mokhtar, and Dubai-based international financier Mohamed Ali Alabbar. This plant was expected to consume 50% of the power generated. The government has agreed in principle that 60% of Sarawak Hidro, the entity that owns the dam, will be sold to GIIG. Owing to delays in dam construction, the plans for the smelter have since been shelved. The agreement for this smelter was originally signed in 2003 and some conditions have lapsed owing to delays in construction. Rio Tinto announced in August 2007 that they had signed a deal with Malaysian conglomerate Cahya Mata Sarawak Berhad (CMSB) to build an aluminium smelter. The production capacity would be 550,000 tonnes initially with expansion to 1.5 million tonnes possible. Production of aluminium would start at the end of 2010. At the end of 2004, the minor partners in the Malaysia‚ÄìChina Hydro JV consortium (Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, WCT Engineering Bhd and MTD Capital) will report quarterly losses due to the Bakun project. Discounting this project, they would all be operating profitably for the quarter. * For Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, this is the first time it will report losses since 1993. Ahmad Zaki estimates net losses suffered for nine months ending 30 September 2004 at RM4.55 million. * WCT has reported a net loss of RM13.08 million for the quarter ending 30 September 2004 due to the Bakun project. * MTD Capital reported a RM4.04 million loss in the quarter ending 30 September 2004 and attributed it to \\"a major project undertaken by the company in joint venture with both local and foreign partners\\" without specifically naming Bakun. * The lead partner in the project, Sime Engineering reported a profit of RM521,000 for the same quarter versus a profit of RM4.18 million for the same quarter in 2003. Declines in profit were attributed to cost overruns and project delays. As of February 2007, there are three developments affecting the Bakun project. The first is the merger of the Sime Darby, Guthrie and Golden Hope into a new entity named Synergy Drive. The second is the proposed takeover of the Bakun project by the contractor, Sime Engineering. The third is the revival of the submarine HVDC cable under the South China Sea to transmit electricity from Borneo to Peninsular Malaysia. In November 2007, Sime Darby, the parent company of the contractor Sime Engineering will be merged with Golden Hope and Guthrie into a new company with a market capitalisation of RM31 billion (US$8 billion).Sime Shareholders Yes To RM32 Bln Merger Concurrently with the merger, the contractor Sime Engineering will takeover the ownership of the Bakun Dam project.Malaysia's Stock Index Falls, Led by IOI; DRB-Hicom Slides Sime Engineering Sdn Bhd has filed a suit against AZRB over alleged breaches in the Malaysia‚ÄìChina Hydro joint venture agreement dated 12 June 2002 relating to the Bakun dam.

The rainforest of this part of Southeast Asia has some of the highest rates of plant and animal endemism, species found there and nowhere else on Earth, and this dam has done irreparable ecological damage to that region. Construction of the dam required the relocation of more than 9,000 native residents (mainly Kayan/Kenyah) of the indigenous peoples who lived in the area to be flooded. Many Sarawak natives have been relocated to a longhouse settlement named Sungai Asap in Bakun. Most of them were subsistence farmers. Each family was promised 3 acres (1.21 ha) of land but many families still have not been compensated.Bakun compensation: Dispute delaying paymentsBakun compensation: Dispute delaying payments Concerns were raised also about such things as the relocation of people; the amount of virgin tropical rainforest that had to be cut down (230 km2); possible dam collapse issues; increase in diseases with waterborne vectors such as schistosomiasis, opisthorchiasis, malaria, and filariasis; and sediment accumulation shortening the useful lifespan of the dam. A 5-part series of Bakun dam documentaries was filmed by Chou Z Lam. The series highlighted the basic community problems faced by displaced indigenous people such as the lack of land areas for farming and hunting, lack of educational, medical, and transport facilities and also the promises not being kept by the government. This documentary series was later banned from Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) on May 2010, forcing the remaining series to YouTube.

The provincial government of Sarawak is still looking for customers to consume the power to be generated by the project. Launched in February 2012, an international NGO coalition that includes organisations from the US, Norway and Switzerland is showing its solidarity with Malaysian groups who are protesting against the construction of twelve hydroelectric dams in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo. The NGO coalition supports the Malaysian groups' demand for an immediate halt to the realisation of these dams, which threaten to displace tens of thousands of Sarawak natives and flood hundreds of square miles of Sarawak's precious tropical rainforests.

Transmission lines  There are four major transmission line sections: The first consists of an HVAC double circuit overhead line running over a distance of 160 km from Bakun Dam to Similajau Static Inverter Plant, situated east of Bintulu. The three further sections consist of a bipolar HVDC 500 kV line. The first section of this line running from Similajau Static Inverter Plant to Kampung Pueh on Borneo will be implemented as overhead lines with a length of 670 km. The next section is the submarine cable between Kampung Pueh to Tanjung Leman, Johor. It will have a length of 670 km. It is planned to be implemented by 3 or 4 parallel cables each with a transmission capacity of 700 MW. The last section on the Malay Peninsula will consist of an overhead DC powerline running from Tanjung Leman to the static inverter plant at Bentong. As part of the transmission works two converter stations will be built at Bakun and Tanjung Tenggara. The HVDC lines will connect to the National Grid, Malaysia operated by Tenaga Nasional Berhad.  Revival of submarine cable component  The revived submarine cable portion is to transmit the electricity generated at Bakun Dam in Borneo to Peninsular Malaysia, possibly by 2012. The consortium partners' equity possibly will be Sime Darby (60%), Tenaga Nasional (20%) and the Malaysian Ministry of Finance (20%). The consortium is exploring financing facilities of up to 80% of the planned investment. The cable is planned to transmit 1,600 MW of power from the Bakun Dam to Yong Peng, Johor by undersea HVDC power cables and then by land line onto the Malaysian National Grid. The use of HVDC cables would ensure that the energy loss is minimal, at about 5% to 6% only. The cost of the undersea cable is estimated at RM9 billion. The proposed concept is for two 800 MW cables being laid about 660 km under the South China Sea from the Sarawak shore to Yong Peng on Peninsular Malaysia. Sime Darby would take ownership of the submarine cable project but not undertake its construction. The contractor is rumoured to be Malaysian Resources Corporation Berhad (MRCB), a public listed company on the KLSE. The buyer of the electricity is Tenaga Nasional. The rate proposed is RM0.17 per kilowatt hour at the intake onto the National Grid. Analysts estimated that generation cost using world- market-rate natural gas would cost RM0.22 per kilowatt hour. A 4% increase every 4 years is envisaged over the 35-year concession period.Rajan Moses: \\"Sime to power up mega Bakun project\\", New Straits Times, 2 February 2007 On 7 January 2008, Sime Darby announced that they had appointed a financial adviser for the undersea power transmission project. However, the company did not name the financial adviser.Ng, Fintar. \\"Sime appoints financial adviser for Bakun transmission\\". The Star Online. 7 January 2008. After many delays, Sarawak Energy Berhad announced that the contract to build the submarine cable would be awarded in mid-2010 with international tenders to be called in early 2010. It was expected that the construction would be completed by 2015 at an estimated cost of MYR8 billion to MYR10 billion. However, the project has been shelved.\\"Federal government to sell Bakun dam to Sarawak; no power transmission to peninsula\\". The Edge Malaysia. 27 September 2010.

A second such group is the linear group L5(2). The Held group is the third possibility, and its construction was completed by John McKay and Graham Higman. The outer automorphism group has order 2 and the Schur multiplier is trivial.  Representations  The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 51; there are two such representations that are duals of each other. It centralizes an element of order 7 in the Monster group. As a result the prime 7 plays a special role in the theory of the group; for example, the smallest representation of the Held group over any field is the 50 dimensional representation over the field with 7 elements, and it acts naturally on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 7 elements.

It lies about 37 km southwest of Singapore, 54 km west of Batam, 24 km northeast of Rangsang Island and 32 km north of Kundur Island. History In the past, Karimun was the destination of foreign traders and the Malay Kings. Around 1615 agents of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) inspected the northwestern coast of the island for the possible construction of a fortification. The proposed fort, however, was never built. Kwa Chong Guan, Derek Heng, Peter Borschberg and Tan Tai Yong, Seven Hundred Years: A History of Singapore (Singapore: Marshall Cavendish, 2019), p. 138. Two centuries later, Colonel William Farquhar surveyed the island after receiving permission from the Bugis Raja Muda of Johor, Raja Ja'afar. Although Karimun was deemed to be of great strategic value at the confluence of the Singapore and Melaka Straits, it was found to have insufficient sources fresh water to sustain a British trading post and a settlement. C. Mary Turnbull, A History of Modern Singapore (Singapore: NUS Press, 2009), p. 27.  Geography  Government office in Tanjung Balai city The island's main city is Tanjung Balai Karimun. , the regency of Karimun had a population of 272,985 with the majority of the people living in Great Karimun. Notable landmarks on the island include Mount Jantan, the beaches of Pelawan and Pongkar, and the Pongkar Waterfall.  Economics  The island has strategic geographical importance, as it is near the Straits of Malacca, an international shipping route. As the island is strategically located at the border of Singapore and Johor (in Malaysia), Karimun being a part of the Riau Islands also is included the SIJORI Growth Triangle partnership. SIJORI (Singapore-Johor-Riau Islands) Growth Triangle is a strategic partnership among Singapore, Johor and Riau Islands that combine the individual and collective strength to improve the subregion attractiveness to investors from both the region and international. SIJORI links the infrastructure, capital, expertise and rich culture of Singapore with the natural resources, lands and labour resources of Johor and Riau Islands. However, due to the stronger ties between Singapore and Malaysia, Karimun is losing its economic attraction to Singaporean investments. Another reason for the loss in attractiveness is the lack of adequate infrastructure in Karimun, especially electricity supply and the lack of transparency in the government administration.  Natural resources  Tanjung Balai port Due to large scale indiscriminate fishing activity near the island recently, fish stocks have been depleted, and thus the fishing businesses have declined considerably. The main export of the island is its granite which is one of the best quality in the world. Sand has also been constantly exported, mainly to Singapore for land reclamation. Indonesian has however limited sand exports over concerns with Singapore's reclamation projects, and banned them outright in the beginning of 2007. Singapore now faces a crisis with many upcoming building developments.  Free Trade Zone  A government building in Tanjung Balai On 29 June 2007 the Indonesian government conferred enclave Free Trade Zone status on Karimun; a move intended to address the issue of legal certainty for investors. Under the plan Karimun will be turned into shipyard, metal, component, agricultural, and marine produce industrial development centres.

Harrison was very prolific and worked with most of the better-known names in European B-movies during the 1960s and 1970s, branching out to exploitation films shot all over the world in the early 1970s. He worked with directors ranging from established names like Antonio Margheriti and Marino Girolami to infamous Z-movie directors like Paolo Solvay, Godfrey Ho and Alfonso Brescia. Harrison's co-stars ranged from major and minor stars of the time like Anita Ekberg, Mich√®le Mercier, Klaus Kinski, Fernando Sancho and Helmut Berger to obscure cult actors such as Mike Monty and Romano Kristoff. Early life Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Harrison left for Los Angeles at 17, where he found work first at the Vic Tanny and Bert Goodrich gyms. Many people working in the film industry trained at the gym and these encounters led Harrison to study acting. In 1961 he married Loretta Nicholson, the daughter of American International Pictures co-chief James H. Nicholson. American film appearances He appeared in a Santa Monica stage production, then in TV, then in small parts in feature films. Harrison worked at Twentieth Century Fox under acting coach Sandy Meiser where he made an appearance at the beginning of South Pacific along with Tom Laughlin and Ron Ely. He eventually signed a three-film deal with American International Pictures, which led him to Italy, where he remained for almost three decades, appearing in sword and sandal films, then Eurospy films and spaghetti westerns. Formal acting studies set Harrison apart from other muscular American actors working in Italy in the early 1960s, such as Brad Harris and Steve Reeves, with whom he is often grouped. 1960s European movies Harrison relocated to Italy in the early 1960s with his first wife Loretta initially in a three-picture contract with producer Italo Zingarelli. He remained in Italy and became a leading star in sword and sandal films, Eurospy films and later spaghetti westerns. His first Italian film and first starring role was in The Invincible Gladiator (1962), directed by Alberto De Martino and Antonio Momplet. Arguably Harrison's most well known film from his early career is the western Gunfight at Red Sands (Duello nel Texas), directed by Ricardo Blasco in 1963. Gunfight at Red Sands is also noteworthy for being the first Italian Western to feature an Ennio Morricone score. Harrison turned down Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and recommended Clint Eastwood for the role.Frayling, Christopher Spaghetti Western: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone, Routledge, 1981, p. 145 Harrison joked that was his greatest contribution to the cinema. The 1968 film Joko - Invoca Dio... e muori Vengeance, directed by Antonio Margheriti, is another favorite among spaghetti western fans. Luciano Martino's 1965 movie Secret Agent Fireball, Harrison's first Eurospy film, is also often cited as his best film in the genre, and one of his better earlier films. He again played the role of CIA Agent Fleming in a sequel Killers Are Challenged in 1966. The Italian actor Bruno Piergentili who made European features during this period was given the name \\"Dan Harrison\\", perhaps to evoke Richard's name. 1970s exploitation films Harrison's career dwindled slowly in the 1970s at the same rate as the spaghetti western died. He began appearing in low-budget movies shot all over the world: In Egypt (You Can Do a Lot with 7 Women (1971), with the Shaw Brothers in Hong Kong starring in the title role of Marco Polo (1975) and playing the German commander von Waldersee in The Boxer Rebellion (1976). Harrison worked in Turkey (The Godfather's Friend, 1972), directed by Farouk \\"Frank\\" Agrama, and as Sgt. Taylor in a Yugoslavian war film, the 1979 effort Pakleni otok, directed by Vladimir Tadej. He made most of his better quality 70s films during the earlier half of the decade, like the comic spaghetti western Due Fratelli Two Brothers in Trinity (1972), which he also directed. His co-star in Due Fratelli was the Irish-American actor Donald O'Brien, another veteran of Italian B-films. Harrison and O'Brien played two estranged brothers rejoined after receiving an inheritance, Harrison a \\"lovable rogue\\", O'Brien a pious Mormon. Harrison wants to spend his money on building a bordello, and comic adventures in the spirit of the Terence Hill/Bud Spencer hit My Name is Trinity (1971) follow. Other notable early 70s films were Churchill's Leopards (1970), directed by Maurizio Pradeaux and also starring Giacomo Rossi Stuart and Klaus Kinski, in which Harrison got to play a double role; Acquasanta Joe (1971), directed by Mario Gariazzo and starring Ty Hardin and Lincoln Tate, an otherwise mediocre western worth mentioning for having Harrison cast against type as a villain; and Dig Your Grave, Friend...Sabata's Coming (1971), directed by Juan Bosch, a western livened up by the presence of Spanish actor Fernando Sancho. Harrison acted in several films with Sancho, the archetypal Mexican bandit of paella and spaghetti westerns, most of which were produced and/or directed by Ignacio F. Iquino. One of the more successful Harrison films from the latter half of the 70s was the Italian crime thriller La Belva Col Mitra (1977) Beast With A Gun, directed by Sergio Grieco, also starring Helmut Berger and Marisa Mell. Harrison played the part of Police Commissioner Giulio Santini, with top-billed Berger as psychotic criminal Nanni Vitali, out to kill Santini and everyone else who testified against him in court. Although La Belva Col Mitra is no classic, it's a well-directed movie and the contrast between Harrison's underplayed style and Berger's manic performance works to its favor. However, La Belva Col Mitra is not without some controversy. Apparently, at Berger's request, Harrison's scenes were cut down in the film. For additional trivia, a scene from La Belva Col Mitra shows up on TV in the Quentin Tarantino film Jackie Brown (1997). Probably the most interesting curio in Harrison's 70s filmography is the 1971 film L'Explosion, directed by Marc Simenon (the son of Georges Simenon) and co-starring Myl√®ne Demongeot. The 1978 martial arts/spy film Challenge of the Tiger is also of curio interest, if only for the presence of Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Le (who also directed the film, with uncredited help from Paolo Solvay), European softcore star Nadiuska and Harrison's son Sebastian. Overseas for Z-movies Harrison in 2011 In the 1980s, Harrison found himself mostly stranded in B-movie action films made in the Philippines and Hong Kong. Although generally considered the lowest point of Harrison's career, some of his 80s' films have gained a cult audience of their own. In the Philippines, Harrison acted in five ultralow-budget actioners, best classified as Z-movies, produced by K.Y. Lim for Silver Star Film Company (called Kinavesa in the Philippines). Three, Fireback, Hunter's Crossing and Blood Debts (1983), were directed by Teddy Page, and two, Intrusion Cambodia (1984) and Rescue Team by John Gale. All were bad, but the three Page films exceptionally so, mixing near-sadistic violence with childlike, enthusiastic naivety reminiscent of the films of Ed Wood. In the books Gods In Polyester and Gods In Spandex, Harrison states that he wrote some of the screenplays for the Filipino films practically overnight, using a pseudonym. The Fireback screenplay Harrison wrote is credited to \\"Timothy Jorge\\", a pseudonym usually used by Don Gordon Bell, one of the expatriate American actors working for Silver Star. Harrison also mentions that the Silver Star films he acted in didn't have complete shooting scripts and many scenes were improvised on the spot, which contributed to their disjointed narrative. Silver Star recycled the same group of American and European expatriate actors from film to film, all of whom appeared in the Harrison vehicles. Mike Monty, an old acquaintance of Harrison from the Italian days who had migrated to the archipelago, James Gaines, Romano Kristoff, Bruce Baron, Ann Milhench and others. Harrison struck a friendship with Kristoff, one of the leading Silver Star actors, and later invited him to Italy to act in a film he produced and directed, Three Men on Fire (1986). At the time they were made, the poor quality of the Filipino films hurt Harrison's reputation. Over the years, they have attracted some cult interest in bad movie fandom. Although he remembers Teddy Page fondly, Harrison doesn't have too many kind words for Lim and working for Silver Star. In Hong Kong, Harrison starred in what was supposed to be a small number of low-budget martial arts \\"ninja\\" films, directed by Chinese filmmaker Godfrey Ho, with whom he was already familiar from working for the Shaw Brothers in the 1970s. However, Ho later re-edited his scenes into several more films in a cut-and- paste style of filmmaking that has since made him infamous. Harrison found himself the unwilling star of almost a dozen different movies, with titles like Ninja Terminator, Cobra Vs. Ninja, Golden Ninja Warrior and Diamond N√≠nja Force. Like the Silver Star productions, the \\"ninja\\" films have since become cult films. Disgusted with that outcome, Harrison returned to the United States. In 1991, Harrison played Jack Roth in the drama film Lies of the Twins opposite Aidan Quinn, Isabella Rossellini and Iman. Directed by Tim Hunter,Jerry Roberts, Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors, Volume 1, (Scarecrow Press: 2009), p. 267. much of the movie was shot at Harrison's beach-front home in Malibu.Video Watchdog, Issues 9‚Äì14, (Tim & Donna Lucas: 1992), p. 64. The film was generally well received by critics upon release.Jim Hillier, The New Hollywood, (Continuum: 1992), p. 64. Harrison subsequently slowed down his film work over the next few years. His last movies to date were the 1993 erotic thriller Angel Eyes and the 2000 film Jerks. Angel Eyes was directed by the prolific cinematographer/director Gary Graver, and starred Erik Estrada, John Phillip Law and Monique Gabrielle. Some of the more noteworthy movies in Harrison's later career were the Moroccan film Amok (1982) and Dark Mission (1987), by the both loved and hated Spanish director Jes√∫s Franco. The latter might not be much better than Harrison's Filipino films in terms of quality, but did have a more-interesting-than-usual cast featuring Christopher Lee, Christopher Mitchum and French adult film star Brigitte Lahaie (also known for appearing in the horror films of Jean Rollin). One of few serious roles that Harrison portrayed in the 1980s was that of American President Andrew Johnson in Ali Hatami's Iranian production Hajji Washington. The film was completed in 1982 but was not screened in Iran until 1998. He has since founded a, now defunct, multisystem electronics company named Gladiator Electronics with his son Sebastian.

It was consecrated in 1730, one of the twelve churches built through the 1711 Act of Parliament. History St Anne's Limehouse was formed from part of the parish of St. Dunstan's Stepney, prior to the 18th century a large (but then thinly populated) East London parish that extended all the way down to the Thames River. As the population of London increased, growing parishes were subdivided. In 1709 a new parish in Limehouse was formed from part of the parish of St. Dunstan. The church may be named for Queen Anne as she raised money for it by taxing coal passing along the River Thames. The building was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, as one of twelve churches built to serve the needs of the rapidly expanding population of London in the 18th century. The scheme never met its original target, but those built were also known as the Queen Anne Churches. The building was completed in 1727 and consecrated in 1730. Queen Anne decreed that as the new church was close to the river it would be a convenient place of registry for sea captains to register vital events taking place at sea. Therefore, she gave St. Anne's Church the right to display the second most senior ensign of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign. The prominent tower with its golden ball on the flagpole became a Trinity House \\"sea mark\\" on navigational charts, and the Queen's Regulations still permit St. Anne's Limehouse to display the White Ensign 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Batch, Jeremy. Why does St. Peter‚Äôs Barge wear the Blue Ensign? February 2012. The church was gutted by fire on Good Friday 1850, and restored between 1851 and 1854 by Philip Hardwick. It was further restored by Julian Harrap between 1983 and 1993, when tubular steel trusses were added to support the roof. The church was Grade I listed in 1950. St Anne's underwent extensive restoration during 2007‚Äì2009, including complete restoration of the organ and work on the altar and floor. The pipe organ in St Anne's won first prize in the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Crystal Palace, and is much prized by musicians. In 2009, the church became the main rehearsal venue for the recently formed Docklands Sinfonia, and occasionally hosts classical concerts. Today, the church remains the parish church of Limehouse, and is within the Diocese of London. St Anne's viewed from the churchyard A distinctive pyramid bearing the inscription \\"The wisdom of Solomon\\" stands in the graveyard, as does a 1918 white stone war memorial with bronze figure of Christ. They are separately Grade II listed. Present day St Anne's is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership. Location The church is next door to Limehouse Town Hall and close to Limehouse Library, both Grade II listed buildings, the former now used as a community centre. Across the road is the former Sailors' Mission, where Situationist International held its conference in 1960. The address is: St Anne's Church, Three Colt Street, London E14 7HP The nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Westferry. St Peter's Barge With the redevelopment of the East London Docklands in the late 20th century, over 100,000 people work in the Canary Wharf area, and a large part of this centre of business and finance lies within the parish of St Anne's Church. As a result, St Anne's began to run lunchtime meetings in pubs and wine bars to reach out to those working in the Wharf. This effort developed with the support of St Helen's Bishopsgate, but further growth was hampered for lack of a permanent venue on the site, which has high property values. The idea to build a floating church was realised with the formation of the St Peter's Canary Wharf Trust and the purchase of a Dutch freight barge in 2003. The barge was refitted in the Netherlands and brought across the North Sea under its own power in the summer of that year ‚Äì a journey which was chronicled in a BBC documentary shown in the autumn. The barge now has a permanent mooring at the heart of Canary Wharf in West India Quay. A permanent full-time Church of England minister was appointed by the Trust in July 2004 and licensed by the area bishop to head the clergy. In September 2004 St Peter's launched a new Sunday evening congregation with its own programme of meetings and groups to serve the many thousands who now live in the area.St Peter's Barge: London's Floating Church.

Czaplicka's research survives in three major works: her studies in Aboriginal Siberia (1914); a travelogue published as My Siberian Year (1916); and a set of lectures published as The Turks of Central Asia (1919). Curzon Press republished all three volumes, plus a fourth volume of articles and letters, in 1999. Early life and studies Czaplicka was born in the Stara Praga district of Warsaw in 1884,Kubica 2007, p. 147. into an impoverished Polish nobility family. She started her studies with the so-called Flying University (later Wy≈ºsze Kursy Naukowe), an underground institution of higher education in Russian-held Poland.Kubica 2007, p. 148. She supported herself with a number of poorly paid jobs, as a teacher, secretary, and lady's companion.Kubica 2007, p. 149. She also wrote poetry, and a novel for children called Olek Niedziela.Kubica 2007, p. 150. In 1910 she became the first woman to receive a Mianowski Scholarship, and was therefore able to continue her studies in the United Kingdom.Collins 1999, Introduction. She left Poland in 1910Kubica 2007, p. 146. and continued her studies at the Faculty of Anthropology of the London School of Economics under Charles G. Seligman, and at Somerville College, Oxford under R.R. Marett.Collins & Urry 1997, p. 18. Marett encouraged her to use her Russian language skills in a review of literature on native tribes in Siberia, which became her book Aboriginal Siberia, published in 1914.Znamenski 2007, p. 67. At this stage she had never visited Siberia, but the quality of her writing led to Aboriginal Siberia becoming the major reference work in its field. Yenisei Expedition Czaplicka, 1919 Marett had intended the work reported in Czaplicka's Aboriginal Siberia to be the basis for fieldwork in Siberia. In May 1914, she began such fieldwork, leading a joint expedition of Oxford University and University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology staff. Together with English ornithologist Maud Doria Haviland, English painter Dora Curtis, and Henry Usher Hall of the Museum, she arrived in Russia shortly before World War I broke out. After the war started Czaplicka and Hall decided to continue their expedition while the others decided to go back to the United Kingdom. Czaplicka and Hall (accompanied by Michikha, a Tungus woman) spent the entire winter travelling along the shores of the Yenisei River: more than altogether.Nuttall 2005, p. 459. Czaplicka prepared several hundreds of photographs of people of Siberia, as well as countless notes on anthropometry and their customs. Czaplicka also received funds from the Committee for Anthropology of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford to collect specimens from Siberia;Twenty-seventh Annual Report of the Delegates of the University Museum (1914). University of Oxford Gazette. XLV. 193 objects were donated by Czaplicka to the museum's Asian collection.Pitt Rivers Museum. (2006). Geographical Statistics PRM Asia collections statistics summary Asian countries and colonies. University of Oxford. See for example: Quiver and arrows In addition, she collected botanical specimens for the Fielding-Druce Herbarium.Fielding-Druce Herbarium collectors list. Return to England and death Czaplicka returned to England in 1915. She wrote a diary of her travel entitled My Siberian Year, which was published in 1916 by Mills & Boon (in their non-fiction \\"My Year\\" series); the book became very popular. In 1916, she also became the first female lecturer in anthropology at Oxford University,Riviere 2009, p. 172. supported by the Mary Ewart Trust. She gave lectures on the nations of Central and Eastern Europe as well as on the habits of the Siberian tribes. She also spoke on Polish issues, including Danzig's post-war disposition. In 1920, her work was honoured with a Murchison Grant from the Royal Geographical Society,The Geographical Journal, Vol. 55, No. 5 (May, 1920), p. 400. \\"for her ethnographical and geographical work in Northern Siberia.\\" In spite of this triumph, her financial future was still insecure. Her three-year fellowship at Oxford having expired in 1919, she obtained a temporary teaching position in anthropology in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Bristol. In 1921, she failed to obtain the Albert Kahn Travelling Fellowship which she had hoped for, and in May of that year she poisoned herself. The University of Bristol Senate expressed its regret and \\"appreciation of the loss to the University of so distinguished a member of its staff\\".Minutes of the University's Senate 1920‚Äì21, p. 287. Czaplicka is buried in the Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford. Post-death In a will written months before she died, Czaplicka left her notes and reports to her colleague Henry Usher Hall. Although she never married, questions have been raised about the relationship between Hall and Czaplicka, and whether she had feelings for him. Hall had married in the US at about the same time of Czaplicka's suicide; it is unknown if Hall's marriage led Czaplicka to kill herself. After Hall died in 1944, some of Czaplicka's early papers were donated to the University of Pennsylvania Museum, but at least one report and a partial manuscript may be lost.Collins & Urry 1997, p. 20. Her primary papers are archived at Somerville College, Oxford.CP-SCO Czaplicka Papers, Somerville College, Oxford. Polish museums hold a few private letters of Czaplicka to Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orkan, one of the most prominent Polish poets of the time. Upon her death in 1971, Barbara Aitkin, a student of Marett and friend of Czaplicka's, memorialised Czaplicka with a fund at Somerville College. In 2015, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford held a small exhibition entitled \\"My Siberian Year, 1914‚Äì1915\\" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Czaplicka's expedition to Siberia.Exhibitions and Case Displays at Pitt Rivers Museum (accessed 8 May 2015)  Selected works  *Aboriginal Siberia: A Study in Social Anthropology.

Dy·∏óus (lit. \\"daylight-sky-god\\"), also Dy·∏óus ph‚ÇÇt·∏ór (lit. \\"father daylight-sky-god\\"), is the reconstructed name of the daylight-sky god in Proto-Indo-European mythology. Dyƒìus was the bright sky of the day conceived as a divine entity and as the seat of the gods, the *deyw·πìs. Associated with the vast diurnal sky and with the fertile rains, Dyƒìus was often paired with *Dh√©«µh≈çm, the Earth Mother, in a relationship of union and contrast. While its existence is not directly attested by archaeological or written materials, Dyƒìus is considered by scholars the most securely reconstructed deity of the Indo-European pantheon, as identical formulas referring to him can be found among the subsequent Indo-European languages and myths of the Vedic Indo-Aryans, Latins, Greeks, Phrygians, Messapians, Thracians, Illyrians, Albanians and Hittites.'''' Name  Etymology  The divine name *Dyƒìus stems from the root *dyeu-, denoting the \\"diurnal sky\\" or the \\"brightness of the day\\" (in contrast to the darkness of the night), ultimately deriving from *di or dei- (\\"to shine, be bright\\"). Cognates in Indo-European languages revolving around the concepts of \\"day\\", \\"sky\\" and \\"deity\\" and sharing the root *dyeu as an etymon suggest that Dyƒìus was the vast and bright sky of the day conceived as a divine entity. A v·πõddhi- derivative appears in *deyw√≥s (\\"celestial\\"), the common word for \\"god\\" in Proto-Indo-European. In classic Indo-European, associated with the late Khvalynsk culture (3900‚Äì3500), *Dyƒìus also had the meaning of \\"Heaven\\", whereas it denoted \\"god\\" in general (or the Sun-god in particular) in the Anatolian tradition.' The suffix-derivative *diwy√≥s (\\"divine\\") is also attested in Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. The root (\\"day\\"), interpreted as a back-formation of *deyw√≥s, has descendant cognates in Vedic Sanskrit div√©-dive (\\"day by day\\"), Latin diƒìs (\\"day\\") and Dies, goddess of the day and counterpart to Greek Hemera, Hittite siwat (\\"day\\"), Palaic Tƒ´yat- (\\"Sun, day\\"), Ancient Greek endios (\\"midday\\"), Old Armenian tiw (’ø’´÷Ç, \\"bright day\\"), Old Irish (\\"nine-day period\\"), Welsh (\\"today\\"),' or Slavic Poludnitsa (\\"Lady Midday\\").M√°chal, Jan (1918). \\"Slavic Mythology\\". In L. H. Gray (ed.). The Mythology of all Races. III, Celtic and Slavic Mythology. Boston. p. 267. While the Greek goddess Pandeia or Pandia (, \\"all brightness\\") may have been another name for the Moon Goddess Selene, her name still preserves the root *di-/*dei-, meaning \\"to shine, be bright\\".Fairbanks, Arthur. The Mythology of Greece and Rome. New York: D. Appleton‚ÄìCentury Company. 1907. p. 162. Regarding the meaning of \\"Pandia\\", Kerenyi (Kerenyi, Karl. The Gods of the Greeks. Thames & Hudson. 1951), p. 197, says: '\\"the entirely shining\\" or the \\"entirely bright\\"‚Äî doubtless the brightness of nights of full moon.'  Epithets  The most constant epithet associated with *Dyƒìus is \\"father\\" (*ph‚ÇÇt·∏ór). The vocable \\"Father Dyƒìus\\" was inherited in the Vedic Dy√°u·π£ Pit·πõÃÅ, Greek Zeus Patƒìr, Illyrian Dei-p√°trous, Roman Jupiter (*), even in the form of \\"dad\\" or \\"papa\\" in the Scythian Papaios for Zeus, or the Palaic expression Tiyaz papaz.' The epithet *Ph‚ÇÇt·∏ór «¥enh‚ÇÅ-t≈çr (\\"Father Procreator\\") is also attested in the Vedic, Iranian, Greek, and perhaps the Roman ritual traditions.  Role  Dyƒìus was the Sky or Day conceived as a divine entity, and thus the dwelling of the gods, the Heaven.' As the gateway to the deities and the father of both the Divine Twins and the goddess of the Dawn (Haus≈çs), Dyƒìus was a prominent deity in the Proto-Indo-European pantheon. He was however likely not their ruler or the holder of the supreme power like Zeus and Jupiter.' Dyƒìus was associated with the bright and vast sky, but also to the cloudy weather in the Vedic and Greek formulas *Dyƒìus' rain. Although several reflexes of Dyƒìus are storm deities, such as Zeus and Jupiter, this is thought to be a late development exclusive to Mediterranean traditions, probably derived from syncretism with Canaanite deities and the Proto-Indo- European god Perkwunos. Due to his celestial nature, Dyƒìus is often described as \\"all-seeing\\" or \\"with wide vision\\" in Indo-European myths. It is unlikely however that he was in charge of the supervision of justice and righteousness, as it was the case for the Zeus or the Indo-Iranian Mithra‚ÄìVaruna duo; but he was suited to serve at least as a witness to oaths and treaties. Proto-Indo- Europeans also visualized the sun as the \\"lamp of Dyƒìus\\" or the \\"eye of Dyƒìus\\", as seen in various reflexes: \\"the god's lamp\\" in Euripides' Medes, \\"heaven's candle\\" in Beowulf, \\"the land of Hatti's torch\\" (the Sun-goddess of Arinna) in a Hittite prayer, Helios as the eye of Zeus, Hvare-khshaeta as the eye of Ahura Mazda, and the sun as \\"God's eye\\" in Romanian folklore. Consort Dyƒìus is often paired with *D ∞√©«µ ∞≈çm, the Earth goddess, and described as uniting with her to ensure the growth and sustenance of terrestrial life; the earth becomes pregnant as the rain falls from the sky. The relationship between Father Sky (*Dyƒìus Ph‚ÇÇt·∏ór) and Mother Earth (*D ∞√©«µ ∞≈çm M√©h‚Çêtƒìr) is also of contrast: the latter is portrayed as the vast and dark dwelling of mortals, located below the bright seat of the gods. According to Jackson however, as the thunder-god is frequently associated with the fructifying rains, she may be a more fitting partner of Perkwunos than of Dyƒìus. While Hausos and the Divine Twins are generally considered the offsprings of Dyƒìus alone, some scholars have proposed a spouse-goddess reconstructed as *Diw≈çnƒÅ or *Diu≈çneh‚ÇÇ, with a possible descendant in Zeus's consort Dione. A thematic echo occurs in the Vedic tradition as Indra's wife IndrƒÅnƒ´ displays a similar jealous and quarrelsome disposition under provocation. A second descendant may be found in Dia, a mortal said to unite with Zeus in a Greek myth. The story leads ultimately to the birth of the Centaurs after the mating of Dia's husband Ixion with the phantom of Hera, the spouse of Zeus. Another female name derived from *Dyeus may be found in the Mycenaean Greek Diwia, attested in the second part of the 2nd millennium BC and which may have survived in the Pamphylian dialect of Asia Minor.Ventris, Michael; Chadwick, John. Documents in Mycenaean Greek. Cambridge at the University Press. 1956. p. 125.Skelton, Christina. Greek-Anatolian Language Contact and the Settlement of Pamphylia. Classical Antiquity. Vol. 36, Issue 1. The Regents of the University of California. 2017. pp. 104-105. The reconstruction is however only based upon the Greek‚Äìand to a lesser extent the Vedic‚Äìtradition, and it remains therefore not secured. If the female goddesses Hera, Juno, Frigg and Shakti share a common association with marriage and fertility, Mallory and Adams note however that \\"these functions are much too generic to support the supposition of a distinct PIE 'consort goddess' and many of the 'consorts' probably represent assimilations of earlier goddesses who may have had nothing to do with marriage.\\" Evidence Cognates stemming either from the root *dyeu (\\"daylight, bright sky\\"), the epithet *Dyƒìus Ph‚ÇÇter (\\"Father Sky\\"), the v·πõddhi-derivative *deiw√≥s (\\"celestial\\", a \\"god\\"), the derivative *diwy√≥s (\\"divine\\"), or the back-formation (a \\"day\\") are among the most widely attested in Indo-European languages.'''' *Laurel-wreathed head of Zeus, c 360‚Äì340 BC.

Legacy  As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to Proto-Indo-European religion evolved, attributes of Dyƒìus seem to have been redistributed to other deities.

It is to be distinguished from diarchies or duumvirates such as ancient Sparta and Rome, or contemporary Andorra, where monarchical power is formally divided between two rulers. Historical examples Historical examples of this include the coregency of Frederick I of Austria and Louis the Bavarian over the Kingdom of Germany. Jure uxoris Kings in Kingdoms such as Spain and Portugal can also be found (Ferdinand V and Isabella I of Castile, Philip I and Joanna of Castile, Peter III and Maria I of Portugal, etc.). In Navarre, the husbands of queens regnant were styled as co-rulers. Ancient Egypt Another example is in Ancient Egypt, mainly in the Middle Kingdom, where the Pharaoh occasionally appointed his successor (often one of his sons) as coregent, or joint king, to ensure a smooth succession. The Pharaoh also did this when he was elderly or unable to rule his country on his own (such as the case of Thutmose III and Amenhotep II or Amenemhat I and Senusret I). The existence of the practice makes establishing firm dates in Egyptian chronology more of a challenge, as the lengths of coregencies are often uncertain and complicate the use of accepted regnal lengths to establish dates. Some of the Queens of Egypt rose to a status of equal to the God-Kings, becoming co-rulers and / or at least as important in religious affairs, and were even portrayed with the same size as their male consort and even with the same size as the other Gods of Egypt. Such were the cases of Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Nefertari and the Nubian Egyptian Queens. In the Ptolemaic Dynasty women finally rose to become equal co-rulers with men and even challenging them in order to become their respective consorts. This was due to a progressive improvement of the already high status of women in the Egyptian society, as well as to the religious principle of balance (Maat) between male and female. In Nubia, Queens like Amanishakheto and Amanitore were crowned alongside Kings at Dangeil and had both their pyramids at Mero√´ with the same height and side by side, and exercised power at the same level, even commanding armies. In Ethiopia, Kandakes also reached and hold this or a similar status. Britain The monarchy of England experienced joint rule under the terms of the act sanctioning the marriage of Mary I to Philip II of Spain. Philip notionally reigned as king of England (inclusive of Wales) and Ireland by right of his wife from 1554 to 1558. Similarly, following the Glorious Revolution, Mary II and her husband William III held joint sovereignty over the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1688 to 1694. China The Gonghe Regency (meaning joint harmony) of the Zhou dynasty in China was ruled jointly by two dukes for a short period according to Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, but it is more likely that the Count of Gong was the actual single ruler (according to bronze tapestries). Lithuania The Lithuanian Grand Dukes typically selected submonarchs from their families or loyal subjects to assist controlling the Grand Duchy. However, the Grand Dukes remained superior. *Vytenis (superior) and Gediminas *Gediminas (superior) and an unknown duke of Trakai, presumably Gediminas's son. *Algirdas (superior) and Kƒôstutis *Jogaila (superior) and Kƒôstutis A slightly different system developed for a brief period after Vytautas became Grand Duke, where nominally Vytautas ruled together with Jogaila, who took the title of ' (Supreme Duke), but he has not once used the title to take any action, and in general the powers invested in the title were not clearly stated in any documents, besides the Pact of Horodlo, which guaranteed that Jogaila would have to approve the selection of a Lithuanian Grand Duke. The title was not used by any other king of Poland after Jogaila. * Vytautas (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke) * ≈†vitrigaila (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke) for a brief period, until ≈†vitrigaila declared war on Poland * Sigismund I of Lithuania (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke) until Jogaila's death. Russia Following the death of Tsar Feodor III of Russia in 1682, his brother Ivan and half-brother Peter were both crowned autocrats of Russia. This compromise was necessary because Ivan was unfit to rule due to physical and mental disabilities, while Peter's exclusive rule was opposed by Feodor and Ivan's older sister Sofia Alekseyevna, who led a Streltsy uprising against him and his mother's family. Because neither Tsar was of age to rule, Sofia subsequently claimed regency until she was removed from power by Peter in 1689. Ivan V and Peter I's joint reign continued, however, with Ivan maintaining formal seniority despite having little participation in the affairs of the state until his death in 1696, at which point Peter became the sole ruler. Sweden The monarchy in Sweden has had several periods of joint rule: Erik and Alrik, Yngvi and Alf, Bj√∂rn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale, Eric the Victorious and Olof Bj√∂rnsson, Eric the Victorious and Olof Sk√∂tkonung, Halsten Stenkilsson and Inge I, and Philip and Inge II. Date discrepancies In the book The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, Edwin R. Thiele proposed co-regency as a possible explanation for discrepancies in the dates given in the Hebrew Bible for the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. At least one co-regency is explicitly documented in the Bible: the coronation of King Solomon occurred before the death of his father David. Some Kings of Egypt, especially during the Twelfth Dynasty, also practiced this custom by associating their own sons in order to both prepare them for the office and prevent anyone else from usurping the throne.

He was known for his forthright, generally right-wing views and for trading abusive remarks with some of his callers. He was also the 13th and longest-serving \\"Beast\\" on the popular panel TV talk show, Beauty and the Beast.  Career  Zemanek was born and raised in Sydney, New South Wales, but began working in radio as a researcher for Radio C-Fun 141 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He worked as a producer on the John Laws program in Australia starting in 1978, before returning to North America for some years, where he covered the 1983 America's Cup. He spent a decade presenting on 2UE late at night beginning in 1987. He spent a year in 2000 presenting the 2GB morning shift. Zemanek moved to Melbourne for a short stint with 3AW's drive program in 2002 before moving back to Sydney and 2UE in 2003, having failed to garner ratings, and publicly falling out with several members of the 3AW's broadcast team. While popular with much of his audience, Stan often boasted about being the most complained- about broadcaster in the country, polarising opinions of those who did not agree with his right-wing beliefs. He was not shy to admit that he was politically biased and often criticised \\"idiot Labor voters\\" for not doing the same. His most commonly used terms were \\"numb nuts\\", \\"turn it up\\", \\"half-wit\\", \\"oxygen thief\\", \\"left-wing looney\\", \\"give yourself an uppercut\\" and \\"typical Labor voter\\"; and he once asked a caller who sounded to be a little slow 'are you smoking the wacky-tobacky', a slang reference to marijuana. In 2003, following his return to 2UE, he received a bombardment of calls from a number of people he referred to as 'The Phone Box Boys', thinking they were all calling him from a phone box. The calls would sometimes reach 20 a night, and would spin several staples of Zemanek such as sound effects, on Stan himself. This led to an enormous spike in his ratings for the period of March‚ÄìJuly 2003. Zemanek had an ongoing rivalry with fellow 2UE colleague and breakfast host Mike Carlton, ever since Carlton revealed on-air that Zemanek was about to move to 2GB. An angry Zemanek called for Carlton to be sacked and for the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate him for \\"irresponsible journalism\\". The \\"debate\\" between the two broadcasters degenerated over the next few days, with Carlton calling Zemanek \\"a little shit\\", \\"a village idiot\\", and \\"a stunted runt\\" and Zemanek calling Carlton \\"a turd\\" and \\"a ponce\\" with \\"his head up his backside\\". After Zemanek's death, Carlton stated on his breakfast show at 2UE that he hated Zemanek and would only attend his funeral to check that he was really dead, causing 2UE management to publicly denounce Carlton. Carlton made his comment while showbiz reporter Peter Ford was doing a report on Zemanek's funeral. At the time Ford made light of Carlton's comments. On reflection, however, he was disgusted and blasted Carlton on 2UE that day. Ford explained that Zemanek was a mentor and friend and that he was disgusted with what Carlton had said. Ford resigned from his spot on Carlton's program (but continues to report for other 2UE programs).  Personal life  Stan and his wife, Marcella Zemanek, had two daughters, Gaby and Melissa, and two grandchildren at the time of his death. Being a Sydneysider, he supported the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the NRL, before moving to Melbourne (where Australian rules football is the dominant football code), where he elected to support the Carlton Football Club.Jim Main, Aussie rules for dummies (2nd edition, 2008), p. 252.  Ill-health, retirement and death  Zemanek was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain tumour that is almost universally fatal within a few years, in May 2006. Treatment included chemotherapy and radiotherapy in addition to surgery performed by Charles Teo. After rumours in 2006, Zemanek's retirement, and intention to look after his health and spend time with his family, was announced on 9 December 2006. His final show went to air on 22 December 2006. Many in the commercial radio industry paid tribute to Zemanek on-air, including his former on-air colleagues and, later, rivals (on 2GB), Alan Jones and Ray Hadley. While Zemanek intended to return to Beauty and the Beast in early 2007, and he celebrated his 60th birthday with former Beauty and the Beast co-stars, his health deteriorated in retirement. In June 2007, he and his wife cut short a planned holiday due to illness, and in early July 2007 his family announced that he was dying. He died in his sleep in the early hours on 12 July 2007. His funeral, open to the public, was held on 17 July 2007, at St. Mary's Catholic Church in North Sydney, and was followed by a private cremation.

She became a household name at home after winning a song competition on national radio with her version of the Don Clarke song, Sanbonani. The final stage of the song competition was televised, bringing P J Powers to the attention of the wider South African public. Sanbonani was a hit record in South Africa. World in Union, the Ladysmith Black Mambazo record featuring P J Powers, became an international hit record in 1995. It charted in the UK (no 47 on the singles charts). P J Powers is well known for her anti-apartheid and activism, human rights advocacy and philanthropy. Early life and career Penelope Jane Dunlop was born in Durban, Natal Province (now in KwaZulu-Natal), South Africa on 16 July 1960. Her singing career kicked off in 1979 when she became the lead singer of an all female group called Pantha. It disbanded after a year. PJ Powers went on to front a new band, Hotline. Their sound, afro-pop fusion music framing PJ Powers' distinctive voice, attracted an expanded, cross cultural fan base. The band lasted for seven years and produced some of the biggest local hits of the 1980s. The formula of young, energetic musicians performing vibrant music in all areas was well accepted by their youthful target audience. Some fans started calling PJ Powers by a nickname, Thandeka (\\"loved one\\"), a name that she still uses today. Hotline took music to the people. This increased their popularity and grew their fan base in the neighbouring countries of Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia. Combining music that people could dance to with messages of hope and reconciliation was different to what was played on the radio at the time. Jabulani (written by bass guitarist George van Dyk who later formed his own band called Wozani.) was the first big hit. Powers followed up by writing some hits of her own ‚Äì You're So Good to Me (1982), Feel So Strong (1983 duet with Steve Kekana), Home to Africa (1985), There Is an Answer (1986) were her own work. P J Powers had honed her craft as a songwriter Hotline disbanded in 1987 and Powers pursued a solo career. Solo career 1988: P.J Powers was. banned from radio and TV for a year by the apartheid government for her performance at a charity concert for war orphans in Zimbabwe, along with Miriam Makeba and Harry Belafonte. She was encouraged to continue her singing by Nelson Mandela, who sent her an encouraging letter from Victor Verster Prison in Cape Town. 1990's - her music developed the Afropop genre further, cementing her receptive audience in the black market. She kept the nickname, \\"Thandeka\\" -\\"the loved one\\". 1995: The Ladysmith Black Mambazo recording \\"World in Union\\" (feat P J Powers) reached no. 47 on the UK Singles Chart. She performed the song live at the opening of the Rugby World Cup in Cape Town for a worldwide television audience. P J Powers has shared the stage with Eric Clapton, Joan Armatrading, Hugh Masekela, Divine Divas, Lord Richard Attenborough, Richard E. Grant, Sibongile Khumalo, Janet Suzman and others.

High-temperature electrolysis (also HTE or steam electrolysis) is a technology for producing hydrogen from water at high temperatures. Efficiency High temperature electrolysis is more efficient economically than traditional room-temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and also because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures. In fact, at 2500 ¬∞C, electrical input is unnecessary because water breaks down to hydrogen and oxygen through thermolysis. Such temperatures are impractical; proposed HTE systems operate between 100 ¬∞C and 850 ¬∞C.Hi2h2 - High temperature electrolysis using SOECWELTEMP-Water electrolysis at elevated temperatures The efficiency improvement of high- temperature electrolysis is best appreciated by assuming that the electricity used comes from a heat engine, and then considering the amount of heat energy necessary to produce one kg hydrogen (141.86 megajoules), both in the HTE process itself and also in producing the electricity used. At 100 ¬∞C, 350 megajoules of thermal energy are required (41% efficient). At 850 ¬∞C, 225 megajoules are required (64% efficient). Materials The selection of the materials for the electrodes and electrolyte in a solid oxide electrolyser cell is essential. One option being investigated for the processKazuya Yamada, Shinichi Makino, Kiyoshi Ono, Kentaro Matsunaga, Masato Yoshino, Takashi Ogawa, Shigeo Kasai, Seiji Fujiwara, and Hiroyuki Yamauchi \\"High Temperature Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production Using Solid Oxide Electrolyte Tubular Cells Assembly Unit\\", presented at AICHE Annual Meeting, San Francisco, California, November 2006. abstract used yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes, nickel-cermet steam/hydrogen electrodes, and mixed oxide of lanthanum, strontium and cobalt oxygen electrodes. Economic potential Even with HTE, electrolysis is a fairly inefficient way to store energy. Significant conversion losses of energy occur both in the electrolysis process, and in the conversion of the resulting hydrogen back into power. At current hydrocarbon prices, HTE can not compete with pyrolysis of hydrocarbons as an economical source of hydrogen. HTE is of interest as a more efficient route to the production of hydrogen, to be used as a carbon neutral fuel and general energy storage. It may become economical if cheap non-fossil fuel sources of heat (concentrating solar, nuclear, geothermal) can be used in conjunction with non-fossil fuel sources of electricity (such as solar, wind, ocean, nuclear). Possible supplies of cheap high-temperature heat for HTE are all nonchemical, including nuclear reactors, concentrating solar thermal collectors, and geothermal sources. HTE has been demonstrated in a laboratory at 108 kilojoules (electric) per gram of hydrogen produced, but not at a commercial scale. The market for hydrogen production Given a cheap, high-temperature heat source, other hydrogen production methods are possible. In particular, see the thermochemical sulfur-iodine cycle. Thermochemical production might reach higher efficiencies than HTE because no heat engine is required. However, large-scale thermochemical production will require significant advances in materials that can withstand high-temperature, high- pressure, highly corrosive environments. The market for hydrogen is large (50 million metric tons/year in 2004, worth about $135 billion/year) and growing at about 10% per year (see hydrogen economy). This market is met by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons to produce the hydrogen, which results in CO2 emissions. The two major consumers are oil refineries and fertilizer plants (each consumes about half of all production). Should hydrogen-powered cars become widespread, their consumption would greatly increase the demand for hydrogen in a hydrogen economy. Electrolysis and thermodynamics During electrolysis, the amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (theoretically) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of any electrochemical process equals 100%. In practice, the efficiency is given by electrical work achieved divided by the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, such as room temperature water electrolysis, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released as waste heat. In the case of electrolysis of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true. Heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the heating value of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input. In this case the efficiency relative to electric energy input can be said to be greater than 100%. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a fuel cell is the inverse of that of electrolysis at the same temperature. It is thus impossible to create a perpetual motion machine by combining the two processes.

Early life  He was the second son of Henry Guard Knaggs and Ellen Mares. He was born on 14 February 1859 (St Valentine's Day) in St Pancras, London, and there is no evidence that he was ever baptised.  Education  Like his father and grandfather before him, he embarked on a medical career. There is no evidence of an apprenticeship but he obtained his LSA in 1881 after studying at University College London. He was awarded his MRCS and his LM in the same year and also an LRCP from the University of Edinburgh. In 1889 he is recorded as being a fellow of the Zoological Society.  A physician  He worked in the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company from 1883 to 1886 presumably on their liners. In 1889 he was resident surgeon at Boscombe Infirmary but his address, from 1883 until 1912 was 189 Camden Road, London NW where he was in general practice as a doctor.  Family  He married Mabel Emily Stow on 24 June 1897 at St Paul's Church, St Pancras ‚Äì Mabel's father James was just described as \\"gentleman\\" on the marriage certificate. They had two daughters ‚Äì Dulcie (born 1901, who married George Menzies Trevor Lambrick (an officer in the Indian Army) 1929 in Witney), and Nora (born 1902, who married John B. Maxwell 1929 in Hatfield).  20th century  The 1913 Medical Who's Who gives Knaggs' addresses as 41 Welbeck Street and Combe Edge, Langley Park, Mill Hill. In 1914 he was living at 41 Queen Anne Street, then, to 1921 (and probably later) he was practising from the up-market address of 25 Wimpole Street, but he was living at \\"Arbor\\", Kings Langley in rural Hertfordshire. His specialities were listed as electro-therapeutics, dietetics and haematology, and his recreations as athletics and literary work of various kinds. Even late in his life he continued in practice, in his 80s seeing patients in London's West End during The Blitz, \\"for which he had a nonchalant disregard\\". In 1954 he was living in 80 Leigh Gardens, Kensal Rise, London.  His publications  Knaggs was a prolific author. Among his more professional works are \\"On the Treatment of Diphtheria by Frequent Small Doses of Sulphur,\\" \\"On the Treatment of Gout by Salicylate of Potash\\" and the like. But by far the more numerous are his books and pamphlets for the general public. They are mostly on various aspects of personal health and diet, and have been described as \\"mostly harmless.\\" Examples are \\"Rheumatism and Allied Ailments,\\" \\"The Cleansing Saline Fast,\\" \\"The Misunderstood Microbe\\", \\"How to Prevent Cancer\\" and \\"Potatoes as Food and Medicine\\" (the last one still in print).  His ideas  He was a naturopath and teetotaling vegetarian, an advocate of natural hygiene, and a long-time member of the National Anti-Vaccination League. He is reported as saying that during the last fifty years as a physician he never prescribed a single drug. He preferred raw foods to cooked ones, and plain water to milk and beverages such as tea and coffee. He was an advocate of exercise and shunned alcohol. Knaggs was influenced by Antoine B√©champ and believed that germs were not the cause of disease but the products of tissue breakdown. He held pseudoscientific and vitalistic ideas. An article in the Medical History journal noted that Knaggs believed that the \\"human body took in three streams of \\"solar life essence\\", as light, as air, and as food and water: and that uncooked vegetables were \\"fully charged with magnetism\\" drawn from sun, earth and water.\\" His vitalistic ideas were ridiculed in the British Medical Journal as unscientific.\\"Herbalists\\" And Medical Practice. (1911). The British Medical Journal 1 (2630): 1274-1277. Knaggs authored The Story of Vitamins, in 1929.

Kallmann syndrome is a form of a group of conditions termed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. To distinguish it from other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Kallmann syndrome has the additional symptom of a total lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or a reduced sense of smell. If left untreated, people will have poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics, show signs of hypogonadism, almost invariably are infertile and are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. A range of other physical symptoms affecting the face, hands and skeletal system can also occur. The underlying cause is a failure in the correct production or activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus. This results in low levels of the sex hormones testosterone in males or oestrogen and progesterone in females. Diagnosis normally occurs during teenage years when puberty fails to start. Lifelong treatment for all sexes is normally required. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the major form of treatment with the aim to replace the missing testosterone or oestrogen and progesterone. Specialised fertility treatments are also available. The condition is more commonly diagnosed in males than in females. A 2011 study of the Finnish population produced an estimated incidence of 1 in 48,000 people overall, with 1 in 30,000 for males and 1 in 125,000 for females. Kallmann syndrome was first described by name in a paper published in 1944 by Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist. The link between anosmia and hypogonadism had already been noted by Spanish doctor Aureliano Maestre de San Juan in 1856.  Signs and symptoms  19 year old with Kallmann syndrome before diagnosis and treatment Singer Jimmy Scott (r), whose unusual voice was due to Kallman syndrome It is normally difficult to distinguish a case of Kallmann syndrome (KS)/hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) from a straightforward constitutional delay of puberty. However, if puberty has not started by either age 14 (girls) or 15 (boys) years and one or more of the non-reproductive features mentioned below is present, then a referral to reproductive endocrinologist might be advisable. The features of KS and other forms of HH can be split into two different categories; \\"reproductive\\" and \\"non-reproductive\\". Reproductive features * Failure to start or fully complete puberty. * Lack of testicle development in men (size < 4 ml, whereas the normal range is between 12 and 25 ml). * Primary amenorrhoea (failure to start menstruation). * Poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics. * Micropenis in 5-10% of male cases. * Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) at birth. * Low levels of the gonadotropins LH and FSH. * Hypogonadism due to low levels of testosterone in men or oestrogen/progesterone in women. * Infertility. Non-reproductive features * Total lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or markedly reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). This is the defining feature of Kallmann syndrome; it is not seen in other cases of HH. Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with anosmia and can be termed as Kallmann syndrome. * Cleft palate, cleft lip or other midline cranio-facial defects. * Neural hearing impairment * Absence of one of the kidneys (unilateral renal agenesis) * Skeletal defects including split hand/foot (ectrodactyly), shortened middle finger (metacarpal) or scoliosis * Manual synkinesis (mirror movements of hands) * Missing teeth (hypodontia) * Poor balance or coordination due to cerebral ataxia. * Eye defects such as coloboma or ptosis. * Increased incidence of color-blindness The exact genetic nature of each particular case of KS/HH will determine which, if any, of the non-reproductive features will occur. The severity of the symptoms will also vary from case to case. Even family members will not show the same range or severity of symptoms. KS/HH is most often present from birth but adult onset versions are found in both males and females. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea is seen in females where the HPG axis is suppressed in response to physical or psychological stress or malnutrition but is reversible with the removal of the stressor. Some cases of KS/HH appear to reverse during adult life where the HPG axis resumes its normal function and GnRH, LH, and FSH levels return to normal levels. This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily normosmic CHH cases rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes. Affected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by placenta at approximately 12 to 20 weeks gestation (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH. People with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls. Osteoporosis One possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary osteoporosis or osteopenia. Oestrogen (females) or testosterone (males) is essential for maintaining bone density. Deficiency in either testosterone or oestrogen can increase the rate of bone resorption while at the same time slowing down the rate of bone formation. Overall this can lead to weakened, fragile bones which have a higher tendency to fracture. Even a short time with low oestrogen or testosterone, as in cases of delayed diagnosis of KS/CHH can lead to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis but other risk factors, such as smoking are involved so the risk of developing it will vary from person to person. Bone density scans are recommended to monitor the bone mineral density. The bone density scan is known as a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a simple test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform. It involves taking a specialised X-ray picture of the spine and hips and measuring the bone mineral density and comparing the result to the average value for a young healthy adult in the general population. Adequate calcium levels and, probably, more importantly, vitamin D levels are essential for healthy bone density. Some people with KS/CHH will have their levels checked and may be prescribed extra vitamin D tablets or injections to try to prevent the condition getting worse. The role of vitamin D for general overall health is under close scrutiny at the moment with some researchers claiming vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in many populations and can be linked to other diseases. Some people with severe osteoporosis might be prescribed bisphosphonates to preserve bone mass, in addition to hormone replacement therapy. Genetics The genetic and molecular basis of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism To date at least 25 different genes have been implicated in causing Kallmann syndrome or other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH (37). These genes involved cover all forms of inheritance and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction difficult. The number of genes known to cause cases of KS/CHH is still increasing. In addition it is thought that some cases of KS/CHH are caused by two separate gene defects occurring at the same time. Individual gene defects can be associated with specific symptoms which can help in identifying which genes to test for. Between 35-45% of cases of KS/CHH have an unknown genetic cause. The ANOS1 gene defect (previously known as KAL-1) was the first one discovered and the one most commonly tested for. It causes the x-linked form of Kallmann syndrome and is associated with the additional symptoms of anosmia, bimanual synkinesis and renal agenesis. This defect is thought to be responsible for between 5 and 10% of all Kallmann syndrome/CHH cases. Pathophysiology Shows the normal hormonal control of puberty from the hypothalamus down to the testes or ovaries and their negative feedback mechanisms. The negative feedback control allows just the right amount of hormone to be released according to the needs of the body at that time. Shows the effect of the interruption of GnRH hormone release from the hypothalamus and the subsequent inability of the testes and ovaries to function correctly at puberty as seen in cases of KS/HH. In most cases of KS/HH the testes and ovaries are able to function correctly, but fail to do so because they have not had the correct hormonal signals. The structure of GNRH1 (from ) The underlying cause of Kallmann syndrome or other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a failure in the correct action of the hypothalamic hormone GnRH. The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome which share some similar symptoms but have a different etiology. The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating sex hormones; testosterone in males and oestrogen and progesterone in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the gonadotropin hormones normally released by the anterior pituitary gland known as luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions. In the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the olfactory placode, that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the cribriform plate, along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the rostral forebrain. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurons towards the brain. Diagnosis Diagnosing KS and other forms of CHH is complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing between a normal constitutional delay of puberty or a case of KS/CHH. The diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of delayed puberty. In males, the use of age appropriate levels of testosterone can help to distinguish between a case of KS/CHH from a case of delayed puberty. If no puberty is apparent, especially no testicular development, then a review by a reproductive endocrinologist may be appropriate. If puberty is not apparent by the age of 16 then the person should be referred for endocrinological review. Post natal diagnosis of KS/CHH before the age of 6 months is sometimes possible as the normal post natal hormonal surge of gonadotropins along with testosterone or oestrogen is absent in babies with KS/CHH. This lack of detectable hormones in the blood can be used as a diagnostic indicator, especially in male infants. In females, diagnosis is sometimes further delayed as other causes of amenorrhoea normally have to be investigated first before a case of KS/CHH is considered. Tanner scale-female Diagnosis of KS/CHH normal involves a range of clinical, biochemical and radiological tests to exclude other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.  Clinical tests  *Comparing height to standard growth charts. *Determining the Tanner stage of sexual development. (Males with KS/CHH are normally at stage I or II with genitalia, females at stage I with breast development and both males and females at stage III with pubic hair development). *Checking for micropenis and undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in males. *Measuring testicular volume. *Checking for breast development and age at menarche in females. *Checking sense of smell using odorant panel or University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) *Checking for hearing impairment. *Checking for missing teeth or presence of cleft lip and/or cleft palate. *Checking for pigmentation of skin and hair. *Checking for mirror movements of the hands or signs of neurodevelopmental delay.  Lab tests  *Early morning hormonal testing including FSH, LH, testosterone, oestrogen and prolactin. *GnRH and/or hCG stimulation test to determine activity of hypothalamus and pituitary. *Sperm test *Liver function, renal function and inflammation marker testing. *Karyotype to check for chromosomal abnormalities.  Medical imaging  *Performing wrist x-ray to determine bone age. *Brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities in the hypothalamus or pituitary and to check for presence of olfactory bulbs. *Ultrasound of kidneys to rule out unilateral renal agenesis. *Bone density scan (DXA) to check for osteoporosis or osteopenia. Treatment Testosterone gel sachets, Testosterone undecanoate injection (Nebido), Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection, Menotropin injection (hMG). For both males and females, the initial aim for treatment is the development of the secondary sexual characteristics normally seen at puberty. Once this has been achieved, continued hormone replacement therapy is required for both males and females to maintain sexual function, bone health, libido and general wellbeing. In males, testosterone replacement therapy is required for the maintenance of normal muscle mass. Early treatment is sometimes required for male infants with suspected KS/CHH to correct un-descended testes and micropenis if present with the use or surgery or gonadotropin or DHT treatment. Females with KS/CHH normally do not require any treatment before the age of adolescence. Currently, no treatments exist for the lack of sense of smell, mirror movement of the hands or the absence of one kidney. Treatment for both males and females with KS/CHH normally consists of one of three options which can be used for both hormone replacement therapy and/or fertility treatment. *Sex hormone replacement (testosterone or oestrogen & progesterone). *Gonadotropin therapy (medications that replicate the activity of FSH and LH). *GnRH pulsatile therapy. Hormone replacement therapy The method and dose of treatment will vary depending on the individual being treated. Initial treatment is normally made with lower doses in younger patients in order to develop the secondary sexual characteristics before adult doses are reached. For males with KS/CHH the types of testosterone delivery include daily patches, daily gel use, daily capsules, sub cutaneous or intramuscular injections or six-monthly implants. Different formulations of testosterone are used to ensure both the anabolic and androgenic effects of testosterone are achieved. Nasal testosterone delivery methods have been developed but their use in KS/CHH treatment has not been formally evaluated. Gonadotropin therapy, in the form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections, with or without the use of FSH, can also be used in male patients to induce secondary sexual characteristic development alongside possible fertility induction. For females, hormone replacement involves the use of oestrogen and progesterone. Firstly, oestrogen is used in tablet or gel form in order to maximise breast development, then a combination of oestrogen and progesterone is used. Cyclical progesterone is normally required to help keep the endometrium (lining of the uterus) healthy. In males, the monitoring of treatment normally requires the measurement of serum testosterone, inhibin B, haematocrit and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). If injections are used, trough levels are taken to ensure an adequate level of testosterone is achieved throughout the injection cycle. In females monitoring normally consists of measurement of oestrogen, FSH, LH, inhibin B and anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH). Standard hormone replacement therapy will not normally induce fertility in either males or females, with no testicular growth in males. Early treatment as adolescents can help with psychological well being of people with KS/CHH. Fertility treatments Gonadotropin therapy can be used in both male and female patients in order to achieve fertility for some people. Pulsatile GnRH therapy can also be used to induce fertility, especially in females, but its use is limited to a few specialist treatment centres. In males with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due to the lack of sperm production within the testes. Sperm production can be achieved through either the use of GnRH administered via a micro infusion pump or through the use of gonadotropin injections (hCG, FSH, hMG). The time taken to achieve adequate sperm production for natural conception will vary from person to person. If the pre-treatment testes are very small and there has been a history of undescended testes it might take longer to achieve sperm production. In these cases, assisted reproductive technology, such as sperm retrieval using testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), might be required. In females with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due to the lack of maturation of eggs located within the ovaries. Ovulation induction can be achieved either with pulsatile GnRH therapy or alternatively with gonadotropin injections (hCG, FSH, hMG) given at set intervals to trigger the maturation and release of the egg for natural conception. Prognosis Reversal of symptoms have been reported in between 10% to 22% of cases. Reversal cases have been seen in both KS and normosmic CHH but appear to be less common in cases of KS (where the sense of smell is also affected). Reversal is not always permanent and the precise genetic causes are not yet fully understood. Epidemiology The epidemiology of Kallmann syndrome is not well understood. Individual studies include a 1986 report reviewing medical records in the Sardinian army which found a prevalence of 1 in 86,000 men and a 2011 report from Finland which found a prevalence of 1:30,000 for males and 1:125,000 for females. Kallmann syndrome occurs about 4 times more often in males than females, but is only 2.5 times more common among males in familial cases. History Franz J. Kallmann, circa 1950 Kallmann syndrome was first described by name in a paper published in 1944 by Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist. The link between anosmia and hypogonadism had already been noted by the Spanish doctor Aureliano Maestre de San Juan in 1856. In the 1950s, De Morsier and Gauthier reported the partial or complete absence of the olfactory bulb in the brains of men with hypogonadism. Terminology The terminology used when describing cases of HH vary and can include: *GnRH deficiency *congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) *idiopathic/isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) *normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nHH) *hypothalamic hypogonadism *olfacto-genital syndrome Research Kisspeptin is a protein that regulates the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn regulates the release of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Kisspeptin and its associated receptor KISS1R are known to be involved in the regulation of puberty. Studies have shown there is potential for kisspeptin to be used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain cases of Kallmann syndrome and CHH.

It is the official youth wing of the political party The Left. It was formed in 2007 as the legal successor to Solid: the socialist youth (['solid] ‚Äì die sozialistische jugend) which was the unofficial youth wing of the Left Party and its predecessor PDS. The name \\"solid\\" comes from sozialistisch, links, demokratisch (socialist, left, democratic.) Solid: the socialist youth was formed in Hanover in June 1999 and was accepted by the Party of Democratic Socialism as a youth organisation \\"close to PDS\\" in March 2002. Membership is for people between the ages of 14 and 35 and in March 2005 they had 1,500 members. Before 1999 the PDS's youth organisation was Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junge GenossInnen; since then, most young members of the Left-Party have concentrated within ['solid]. But due to differences, other young members formed the \\"PDS Youth\\", a youth organisation integrated within the party and by self-definition of the group serving to form future cadres for the full-fledged party. The PDS-youth is small compared to ['solid] and only represented in a small number of the federal States of Germany. On Solid's federal delegate congress on 20 May 2007, the organisation reorganised to the present structure including the former PDS Youth and the youth organisation of WASG. This was a response to the fusion of the Left Party/PDS and WASG.

The engine had its origins in the 1930s Ford Model Y, and were made in two sizes, or \\"8 HP\\", and or \\"10 HP\\". The early engines did not have a water pump as standard, instead relying on thermosiphon cooling as the Model T engine had. A water pump was added in 1953 for the 100E models when the engine was re- engineered to the point that few specifications are identical between the early and the latter series. The Sidevalve engine was used in many smaller Fords as well as farm vehicles, commercial vehicles and a marine version in boats. Production of the engine was stopped in 1962. Windscreen wipers were often driven by the vacuum generated in the inlet manifold. The Sidevalve Engine was also used in German Fords, starting with the Ford K√∂ln in 1932 and ending with the last rear wheel drive Ford Taunus 12M (G13/G13AL) in 1962. Only the 1172cc version originally invented for the english Ford \\"10 HP\\" was used in the german Ford lines. Early further research and development was being carried out at the german Ford engine plant in Cologne to improve the engine for ease of use in the Taunus line of cars but this work was finally halted in 1942. It was replaced by the Kent engine in Britain and by the Taunus V4 engine in Germany. Engine modifications Many ways were explored to enhance the power output of the standard engine, most notably special exhaust manifolds, twin carburettors, stiffer valve springs, thinner cylinder head gaskets and modified camshafts.  Power rating  The nominal horsepower quoted for each engine size comes from the British method of power calculation for road taxation purposes, and bears no relationship with the actual power output. Displacement, cylinder diameter, stroke, and number of cylinders determined the power for road taxation purposes. Gearbox & transmission A three speed gearbox was fitted as standard; three forward and one reverse. Several ways of improving the performance through modifications to the gearbox and transmission train were applied; replacement close ratio gears fitted to gearbox, overdrive gears fitted behind the original gearbox and higher ratio crown & pinion gears fitted to the differential unit on the back axle.

Coverage Stations that carry the broadcasts include those owned by Capital Radio Network, Grant Broadcasters and some independently owned stations (such as 2BS Bathurst and 2LT Lithgow), as well as MRN's owned and operated stations in regional Queensland. The show, also known as Weekend Detention, is transmitted on Fridays from 7 pm to 9:45 pm, Saturdays from 12 pm through to around 8 pm, and on Sundays from 12 pm to 6 pm. Some stations carry all days, some carry only one or two of the three days. In 2006, the program lost major coverage with the Broadcast Operations Group failing to come to terms with Macquarie and the NRL to broadcast games, which lead to 2SM's own Talking Sport program being relayed in its place. In 2008 and 2009, the network carrying 2GB's coverage has grown, with stations in Northern Queensland, Northern Territory and the Central Coast carrying the program. Following the acquisition of FM radio rights by Southern Cross Austereo's Triple M Network in early 2013, regional stations that had carried the show in previous years will drop 2GB's coverage in favour of Triple M's coverage, as those stations are part of that network via the Localworks division. It is unknown if stations owned by rival companies such as BOG or community stations will take up the program in their place. This will not affect those stations' carriage of Hadley's weekday program.

Thanks to live streaming on the Internet, the program can be heard in other states of Australia and throughout the world, and many ex-pats living overseas email the team to have their say. The team also have a number of regular callers to the program. Elsie, a pensioner from Maitland, who always had pieces of advice for the boys along with anecdotes about greyhounds as well as her ardent support of her beloved Newcastle Knights, was a regular caller until her death in 2007. Another regular, \\"Burnsie\\", is known for his interesting love life, which he is always reluctant to discuss. Another feature of The Continuous Call Team is a plethora of phone calls from people wishing to seek some counselling, to which they are none the wiser with no help whatsoever from the team who are only qualified in football related matters. For their troubles, they receive a Continuous Call Team Showbag that consists of novelty items. Although they are of no worth at all, they serve as a reminder and a great souvenir of when they have been counselled by \\"The Gibberers\\". A memorable counselling call came from a young lady named Kelly, who came from Hervey Bay and was dating a footballer's father twice her age. Hilarity erupted when Kelly attempted to put him on the phone but he wouldn't get off the lounge simply because he was old and lazy. The show also specialises in trucking and features the \\"10‚Äì4 big buddy\\" theme song \\"Convoy\\" which was a massive hit for C.W. McCall. The song is featured as a small snippet to indicate the time is 3.50pm (or ten to four, big buddy ‚Äì hence \\"10‚Äì4 big buddy\\") or whenever the football score is 10‚Äì4, but is also played in full at the request of listeners. The team offers podcasts via its website, featuring highlights of the programme over the weekend, but not games. The Robertson Brothers are a band who help with creating many songs for the show. Fridays The Continuous Call Team broadcasts Friday Night Football from 7.00pm (with the kick-off at 7.30pm) till 9.45pm. David Morrow calls the selected scheduled game that's on the Nine Network in Sydney with Darryl Brohman and Mark Riddell on the sidelines. Saturdays Between 12pm and 5pm, the programme is broadcast from the 2GB studio in Pyrmont with Mark Levy, Hadley, Fulton, Brohman, Mark Riddell, Erin Molan and David Morrow. The program consists of reviews of the previous night's match, short reports on the night's upcoming match, combined with large amounts of comedy, including stories of the team member's private lives, humorous songs about the team members and issues in rugby league, as well as discussion on unrelated issues. However, much of the program is focused on the open line calls of the program's listeners. From 5pm ‚Äì 7:30pm the program moves to a live broadcast from either the ground or the 2GB 873 Interactive Studio, depending on where the game it located. The program is hosted by Mark Levy, with David Morrow, Riddell and Brohman. As of 2012, 2GB hosts a live broadcast of the 7:30pm NRL game with Mark Levy and Chris Warren (Son of Ray Warren) as commentators. After the game, there are player interviews plus the broadcast team analyse the night's games with callers and emailers. Sundays The programme airs from 12 Noon- 6pm and is broadcast live from the ground of a selected Sunday match. Progress scores from other matches are provided by reporters live at those grounds. The team review the Saturday night match, and discuss the upcoming matches for that day. There is less of a focus on comedy on Sundays, however it is still evident. From 2pm or 3pm, Mark Levy with Mark Riddell and Darryl Brohman broadcast the selected match. After the game, players and coaches are interviewed, listeners give their opinions on the day's matches, and the premiership ladder is updated. History The program began in 1987 when Ray Hadley and Ray Price took over the commentary duties on 2UE. When 2UE lost the rights to broadcast NRL games in 1999 to 2GB, the station asked commentator Ray Hadley to present a six-hour rugby league program, without having the rights to the actual games, nor having access to their reporters inside the ground. Several 2UE commentators, including John Gibbs and Darryl Brohman, joined 2GB. The program was renamed The Talking League Team. The team consisting of Ray Hadley, Peter Frilingos, Bob Fulton, Steve Roach, Tony Megahey and Greg Alexander astounded industry insiders when they beat 2GB and ABC Radio, both of whom had the actual rights to NRL games in 2000 and 2001. Many network stations dropped 2GB coverage and switched to 2UE's coverage. At one stage, rival 2GB campaigned for Foxtel to cut off 2UE's access to the service, as they were calling games off their coverage. The team stopped the practice soon after the threat was made. In 2002, when Ray Hadley moved to 2GB, he brought his team over with him (with the exception of Alexander) to bring their coverage of live NRL games, and continued to win the ratings since then. In 2004, the team lost longtime member Peter Frilingos to a heart attack, and his spot was not filled for the rest of the season, to be eventually replaced by Darryl Brohman in 2005. In 2011, Hadley gave up commentating games with Moore calling all three weekend games. In 2012, Hadley would take over commentating Nine Network's second Friday night game. Songs Throughout the history of The Continuous Call Team, music has been an integral part of the program with send ups of popular songs of any era and genre. Lyrically, these songs have been directed at anyone or anything related to rugby league (be it referees, clubs, players, coaches and the like). The songs are written and many are also performed by The Robertson Brothers who are exclusively commissioned by and to The Continuous Call Team, as well as other aspiring performers. CCT TV In 2008, a 30-minute program known as CCT TV ‚Äì Weekend Detention, featuring video of the team in the studio of a Saturday afternoon was produced for the RugbyLeagueLive.com website.

Political Profile The current policy statement of the JuLis was passed in 2008. It is a revision of the policy statement of 1994, and is called \\"Humanistic Liberalism - thought for the future\\". It focuses on the market economy and civil liberties, being supplemented by the democratic resolutions of regular congresses. The political objectives of the JuLis mostly aim to the same general objectives as the FDP, however they often differ in details. The Young Liberals advocate civil liberties, sociopolitics and an ecologically sustainable social market economy. The JuLis focus on political freedom, self- responsibility, equal opportunity, deregulation and reducing the state's influence to its core competences such as the prevention from economic cartels. The Young Liberals often perceive themselves as the policy making stimulus of the FDP and try to propose innovations into the party, sometimes succeeding e.g. in the FDP's decision to challenge the abandonment of the German compulsory military service, to support of the concept of an ecologically-sustainable social market economy, and replacement of existing social welfare benefits with a basic income called B√ºrgergeld.

Keep View of the Telouet Kasbah main building, Morocco, North Africa In the Maghreb and in Iberia, the Arabic word form of kasbah frequently refers to multiple buildings in a keep, a citadel, or several structures behind a defensive wall. The Spanish word is a cognate naming the equivalent building in Andalusia or Moorish Spain. In Portuguese, it evolved into the word . In Catalan, the evolution resulted in . A kasbah was a place for the local leader to live and a defense when a city was under attack. A kasbah has high walls, usually without windows. Sometimes, like in Tangiers, they were built on hilltops so that they could be more easily defended. Some were placed near the entrance to harbors. Having a kasbah built was a sign of wealth of some families in the city. When colonization started in 1830, in northern Algeria, there were a number of kasbahs that lasted for more than 100 years. Old city The word kasbah may also be used to describe the old part of a city, in which case it has the same meaning as a medina quarter. Some of the prominent examples of kasbah as an old city is the Casbah of Algiers and the Casbah of Dellys. In Turkish and Urdu the word kasaba refers to a settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city; in short, a town. In Serbo-Croatian, kasaba (Cyrillic: ) means an undeveloped, provincial small town.

Since November 2002, he has been a weekday presenter of the BBC regional news programme Look North. The programme is broadcast from the BBC's Kingston upon Hull studios to the areas of East Riding of Yorkshire, Northern Lincolnshire and parts of Nottinghamshire via the Belmont transmitter. Early life Levy was born in Farnborough, Kent, England, but attended a secondary modern school in Truro, Cornwall. He first came to Yorkshire in his late teens. He was an actor in his teenage years, with small roles in shows such as Dixon of Dock Green, Man About the House, Comedy Playhouse, The Mike Yarwood Show. Career Radio Levy was a disc jockey at Bradford's Pennine Radio (now The Pulse of West Yorkshire) from its launch in 1975 ‚Äì having been hired by the then television journalist and later Member of Parliament Austin Mitchell. He became a presenter at Liverpool's Radio City in the 1970s, starting on the afternoon show before progressing to the drive time slot. Television He originally pursued an acting career and was a minor character in Last Of The Summer Wine. He was then involved in local radio in the south of England before moving to Leeds to co-present BBC Look North.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007tp3n He moved to Leeds-based Radio Aire, and then, in January 1987, to the BBC, eventually having a lunchtime show at BBC Radio Leeds. At this time he started as a regular stand-in presenter for the Leeds edition of Look North, always doing the breakfast bulletins. From between 1992 and 1993, Levy presented a BBC Two series entitled Famous Faces, Favourite Places in which he met well-known individuals who would revisit places of interest. During the programme he met individuals such as John Godber, Fred Trueman and Kathy Staff. Look North was broadcast across the whole of the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region at the time Levy started to work on it. He became the regular breakfast and lunchtime presenter of the programme in the mid-1990s. When the BBC split the region into two, Levy moved to present the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire edition from studios in Hull full-time from 11 November 2002. In May 2005, a strike held by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) saw 15,000 journalists and technicians leave their posts in what was seen as one of the biggest walkouts in the BBC's history. NUJ members in Kingston upon Hull estimated that only a quarter of the 120-strong workforce, including Look North presenter Peter Levy, crossed the picket lines at the city's BBC centre at Queen's Court. Levy's on-screen rapport with weatherman Paul Hudson has made him a popular local figure. The duo visited shopping centres around the region and met the public as part of the 2006 Look North Sofa Tour, this was repeated in 2009. The pair have made public appearances as part of a campaign in the East Riding of Yorkshire's libraries concerning reading among the under 11s. Levy made reference to this campaign on his radio show saying he could not read properly until he was ten and this is why he is passionate about campaigns such as this. He also appears on a regular basis in the ‚ÄòNationwide‚Äô segment on BBC News Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄòAfternoon Live‚Äô. He has the same witty repart√©e, usually with regular Afternoon Live presenter Simon McCoy, as he does with Paul Hudson on Look North. Appearances Levy appeared in a 2003 Last of the Summer Wine episode called \\"The Man Who Invented Yorkshire Funny Stuff\\". He was also mentioned in episode 6 of series 1 of The League of Gentlemen. He has also appeared in the comedy show Still Open All Hours. In 2012, Levy opened the Beverley Food Festival along with the Mayor of Beverley, Margaret Pinder; he is a supporter of the Driffield Show and other country events. He owns five cows,The Journal magazine, September 2012 and keeps them for part of the year on Beverley Westwood, an area of common land where people can graze livestock during the summer months.Beverley Freemen Bill www.parliament.uk, 12 January 2010.

History Odin consisted of Managing Director Paul McKenna; programmers Steve Wetherill, Robbie Tinman, Marc Dawson (now Wilding), Keith Robinson, George Barnes, Tommy Laningan, Derrick Rowson, and Stefan Walker; artists Paul Salmon, Stuart Fotheringham, and Colin Grunes; and musician Keith Tinman. Bernie Duggs and musician Fred Gray are also credited. Prior to the release of their debut title, Nodes of Yesod, in 1985, Odin had previously released a number of games under the name Thor.http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/33088/Odin- Computer-Graphics/ Although they developed a couple of in-house titles as Thor, they mainly acquired the publishing rights to homegrown titles from anonymous bedroom programmers. These early titles were mostly regarded as critical disappointments but not commercial failures. When Thor decided to switch to in-house development, Paul McKenna (managing director & owner) thought it appropriate to form a new company, hence Odin Computer Graphics was born. Nodes of Yesod became an instant critical and commercial success, prompting Telecomsoft (the software division of British Telecom) to offer them a six-figure contract to develop ten games within a 12-month period. While Odin's later games (including Robin of the Wood and Heartland) were very well received, some later titles failed to live up to expected BT standards. During this period, the warehouse area attached to the Odin studio was used by Telecomsoft as a distribution warehouse and to store thousands of copies of games on their Firebird, Rainbird and Beyond labels. Just prior to the Telecom deal Odin had secured a major contract with Capcom. They were to develop Robin Hood for coin-operated arcade machines and Capcom's Gun.Smoke for the home computer format. Unfortunately the contracts arrived a day late. Paul McKenna still has the original contracts from Capcom in his possession. Odin made a very deliberate attempt to ensure they were mistaken for Ultimate Play the Game, one of the most critically acclaimed game developers of the 1980s. As well as establishing a very similar name (Odin Computer Graphics vs. Ashby Computer Graphics), many of their games were heavily inspired by Ultimate's output (Odin's Nodes of Yesod certainly owes a considerable debt to Ultimate's Underwurlde).http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/33088/Odin-Computer- Graphics/ The advertisements for Odin's games, which won many acclaimed awards such as Golden Joystick Awards for best advertising in 1985 and 1986, were reminiscent of 1980s popular print retailer Athena and also bore some resemblance to the highly stylised, airbrushed artwork that graced the adverts for Ultimate's games. In 1987, Odin finally closed their doors,http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/33088/Odin-Computer-Graphics/ mainly due to an inability to expand the size of their teams while maintaining the quality that had put the company on the map in the first place. Although they delivered more than all the necessary titles to fulfill their contract, Telecomsoft deemed several of them to be not worthy of release. By this time many of Odin's core programmers and artists had already jumped ship. Several ex-Odin staff initially joined Denton Designs, another Liverpool-based games developer, before going their separate ways. In 2005, Paul McKenna reformed Odin Computer Graphics Ltd, to develop and produce new titles and convert Nodes of Yesod, Arc of Yesod, Heartland and Robin of the Wood on the Mobile Phone formats. In 2010, Odin Computer Graphics, Ltd., in conjunction with Uztek Games, Inc., released Nodes Of Yesod for the iPhone. A web browser version built with Adobe Flash was also released in the same year.

It is a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organization and related to the Deutsche Kommunistische Partei (German Communist Party). SDAJ is a member of World Federation of Democratic Youth.  History   1968‚Äì1977  SDAJ was formed on May 5, 1968, the 150th birthday of Karl Marx. The SDAJ participated in social movements that arose from 1968's student movement. It became one of the leading left-wing youth organizations in West Germany and enjoyed a high political profile ‚Äì for example, in actions against fare increases (\\"Red Dot Actions\\"). The SDAJ claimed over 35,000 members.  1978‚Äì1987  From 1978 to 1988, the SDAJ organized the Festival of Youth biannually together with the Marxist Student Association Spartacus (MSB). The Festival was held mid-May on the grounds of the Dortmund exhibition. Internationally known artists attended. For example, the 1978 festival included figures such as Jutta Weinhold, Snowball, Udo Lindenberg, Pudys and the Titi Winterstein Quintet. Political debates were a common feature. According to the SDAJ, more than 100,000 visitors attended. Until the fall of the GDR, the SDAJ maintained contact with Free German Youth (FDJ), a sibling organization. In the 1980s, the SDAJ played a major role in the West German peace movement.  1988‚Äì1997  In 1988, conflicts emerged in SDAJ and DKP as reformist tendencies gained strength. At the SDAJ Federal Congress of 1989 the organization split, as the majority of the delegates voted for a proposal that would keep the SDAJ as a Marxist working class youth organization. The defeated faction grouped around then national chairman Birgit Radow and left the Congress. The Radow group failed to create a nationwide organization. Many former leading members switched to the youth structures of the PDS. The fall of the GDR and the reunification of Germany, produced a crisis in SDAJ and DKP. Funding from GDR was discontinued and employees were laid off. Until about 1993, the SDAJ remained virtually without functioning central coordination. In 1994 the reorganization and reactivation of district and local associations began. As of the late 1990s local groups stabilized and new groups established in areas including Leipzig, Dresden, Gera, Potsdam, Rostock, Gadebusch and Berlin.  1998-  Due to the slight increase in membership, the bi-annual Festival of Youth was refounded in 2008 in Jugendpark of Cologne. In October 2011, the SDAJ held its 20th national congress of Hanover.

Ortiz was a prolific polymath dedicated to exploring, recording, and understanding all aspects of indigenous Cuban culture. Ortiz coined the term \\"transculturation,\\" the notion of converging cultures. Life Ortiz was born in Havana. Disillusioned with politics in the early period of Cuban history and having been a member of President Gerardo Machado's Liberal Party, and a Liberal member of its House of Representatives from 1917 to 1922, he became active in the early nationalist civic revival movement. Throughout his life Ortiz was involved in the foundation of institutions and journals dedicated to the study of Cuban culture. He was the cofounder of the Cuban Academy of the Language in 1926. He also founded Surco (founded 1930) and Ultra (1936‚Äì47), both journals that provided commentary on foreign journals. In 1937 he founded the Sociedad de Estudios Afrocubanos (Society of Afro-Cuban Studies) and the journal Estudios Afrocubanos (Afro-Cuban Studies). He helped found the journals Revista Bimestre Cubana, Archivos del Folklore Cubano, and Estudios Afrocubanos. Ortiz also developed a theory of activism within Cuba's political system. He said that Afro-Cubans had been characterized negatively based on their African descent, and traits said to be \\"primitive.\\" He wanted to show the true nature of their culture: its language, music and other arts. His books, La Africania de la Musica Folklorica de Cuba (1950), and Los Instrumentos de la Musica Afrocubana (1952 - 1955) are still regarded as key references in the study of Afro-Cuban music.

Since 1995 it has been led by one of his prominent students, Miguel Barnet, known for his development of the testimonial style in ethnographic studies. In current times the foundation continues the work started by Ortiz. It initiates serious scholarly discussions around many cultural issues, including the survival of elements of racism and racial prejudice, and development of measures to deal with such problems.

The first produces electrical energy similarly to a dye-sensitized photovoltaic cell, which meets the standard definition of a photovoltaic cell. The second is a photoelectrolytic cell, that is, a device which uses light incident on a photosensitizer, semiconductor, or aqueous metal immersed in an electrolytic solution to directly cause a chemical reaction, for example to produce hydrogen via the electrolysis of water. Both types of device are varieties of solar cell, in that a photoelectrochemical cell's function is to use the photoelectric effect (or, very similarly, the photovoltaic effect) to convert electromagnetic radiation (typically sunlight) either directly into electrical power, or into something which can itself be easily used to produce electrical power (hydrogen, for example, can be burned to create electrical power, see photohydrogen).  Two principles  The standard photovoltaic effect, as operating in standard photovoltaic cells, involves the excitation of negative charge carriers (electrons) within a semiconductor medium, and it is negative charge carriers (free electrons) which are ultimately are extracted to produce power. The classification of photoelectrochemical cells which includes Gr√§tzel cells meets this narrow definition, albeit the charge carriers are often excitonic. The situation within a photoelectrolytic cell, on the other hand, is quite different. For example, in a water-splitting photoelectrochemical cell, the excitation, by light, of an electron in a semiconductor leaves a hole which \\"draws\\" an electron from a neighboring water molecule: :::::::::::::H2O(l) + [hv] + 2h+ -> 2H+ (aq) + 1/2O2(g) This leaves positive charge carriers (protons, that is, H+ ions) in solution, which must then bond with one other proton and combine with two electrons in order to form hydrogen gas, according to: :::::::::::::2H+ + 2e- -> H2(g) A photosynthetic cell is another form of photoelectrolytic cell, with the output in that case being carbohydrates instead of molecular hydrogen.  Photoelectrolytic cell  Photoelectrolytic cell band diagram A (water-splitting) photoelectrolytic cell electrolizes water into hydrogen and oxygen gas by irradiating the anode with electromagnetic radiation, that is, with light. This has been referred to as artificial photosynthesis and has been suggested as a way of storing solar energy in hydrogen for use as fuel. Incoming sunlight excites free electrons near the surface of the silicon electrode. These electrons flow through wires to the stainless steel electrode, where four of them react with four water molecules to form two molecules of hydrogen and 4 OH groups. The OH groups flow through the liquid electrolyte to the surface of the silicon electrode. There they react with the four holes associated with the four photoelectrons, the result being two water molecules and an oxygen molecule. Illuminated silicon immediately begins to corrode under contact with the electrolytes. The corrosion consumes material and disrupts the properties of the surfaces and interfaces within the cell. Two types of photochemical systems operate via photocatalysis. One uses semiconductor surfaces as catalysts. In these devices the semiconductor surface absorbs solar energy and acts as an electrode for water splitting. The other methodology uses in-solution metal complexes as catalysts. Photoelectrolytic cells have passed the 10 percent economic efficiency barrier. Corrosion of the semiconductors remains an issue, given their direct contact with water. Research is now ongoing to reach a service life of 10000 hours, a requirement established by the United States Department of Energy.  Other photoelectrochemical cells  The first photovoltaic cell ever designed was also the first photoelectrochemical cell. It was created in 1839, by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, at age 19, in his father's laboratory.https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/manufacturing/first- photovoltaic-devices The mostly commonly researched modern photoelectrochemical cell in recent decades has been the Gr√§tzel cell, although much attention has recently shifted away from this topic to perovskite solar cells, due to relatively high efficiency of the latter and the similarity in vapor assisted deposition techniques commonly used in their creation. Dye-sensitized solar cells or Gr√§tzel cells use dye-adsorbed highly porous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (nc-) to produce electrical energy.  Materials for photoelectrolytic cells Water-splitting photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells use light energy to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen within a two-electrode cell. In theory, three arrangements of photo-electrodes in the assembly of PECs exist: * photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a metal cathode * photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a photo- cathode made of a p-type semiconductor * photo-cathode made of a p-type semiconductor and a metal anode There are several requirements for photoelectrode materials in PEC H2 production: * light absorbance: determined by band gap and appropriate for solar irradiation spectrum * charge transport: photoelectrodes must be conductive (or semi-conductive) to minimize resistive losses * suitable band structure: large enough band gap to split water (1.23V) and appropriate positions relative to redox potentials for H2 and O2 * catalytic activity: high catalytic activity increases efficiency of the water- splitting reaction * stability: materials must be stable to prevent decomposition and loss of function In addition to these requirements, materials must be low-cost and earth abundant for the widespread adoption of PEC water splitting to be feasible. While the listed requirements can be applied generally, photoanodes and photocathodes have slightly different needs. A good photocathode will have early onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (low overpotential), a large photocurrent at saturation, and rapid growth of photocurrent upon onset. Good photoanodes, on the other hand, will have early onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction in addition to high current and rapid photocurrent growth. To maximize current, anode and cathode materials need to be matched together; the best anode for one cathode material may not be the best for another.  In 1967, Akira Fujishima discovered the Honda-Fujishima effect, (the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide). and other metal oxides are still most prominentA. Fujishima, K. Honda, S. Kikuchi, Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi 72 (1969) 108‚Äì113 catalysts for efficiency reasons. Including and , this kind of semiconducting titanates, the conduction band has mainly titanium 3d character and the valence band oxygen 2p character. The bands are separated by a wide band gap of at least 3 eV, so that these materials absorb only UV radiation. Change of the microstructure has also been investigated to further improve the performance, such as nanowire arrays or porous nanocrystalline photoelectrochemical cells. GaN GaN is another option, because metal nitrides usually have a narrow band gap that could encompass almost the entire solar spectrum. GaN has a narrower band gap than but is still large enough to allow water splitting to occur at the surface. GaN nanowires exhibited better performance than GaN thin films, because they have a larger surface area and have a high single crystallinity which allows longer electron-hole pair lifetimes. Meanwhile, other non-oxide semiconductors such as GaAs, , and are used as n-type electrode, due to their stability in chemical and electrochemical steps in the photocorrosion reactions.  Silicon  In 2013 a cell with 2 nanometers of nickel on a silicon electrode, paired with a stainless steel electrode, immersed in an aqueous electrolyte of potassium borate and lithium borate operated for 80 hours without noticeable corrosion, versus 8 hours for titanium dioxide. In the process, about 150 ml of hydrogen gas was generated, representing the storage of about 2 kilojoules of energy. Structured Materials Structuring of absorbing materials has both positive and negative affects on cell performance. Structuring allows for light absorption and carrier collection to occur in different places, which loosens the requirements for pure materials and helps with catalysis. This allows for the use of non-precious and oxide catalysts that may be stable in more oxidizing conditions. However, these devices have lower open-circuit potentials which may contribute to lower performance. Hematite Hematite structure Researchers have extensively investigated the use of hematite (Œ±-Fe2O3) in PEC water-splitting devices due to its low cost, ability to be n-type doped, and band gap (2.2eV). However, performance is plagued by poor conductivity and crystal anisotropy. Some researchers have enhanced catalytic activity by forming a layer of co-catalysts on the surface. Co-catalysts include cobalt- phosphate and iridium oxide, which is known to be a highly active catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Tungsten Oxide Tungsten(VI) Oxide (WO3) , which exhibits several different polymorphs at various temperatures, is of interest due to its high conductivity but has a relatively wide, indirect band gap (~2.7 eV) which means it cannot absorb most of the solar spectrum. Though many attempts have been made to increase absorption, they result in poor conductivity and thus WO3 does not appear to be a viable material for PEC water splitting. Bismuth Vanadate With a narrower, direct band gap (2.4 eV) and proper band alignment with water oxidation potential, the monoclinic form of has garnered interest from researchers. Over time, it has been shown that V-rich and compact films are associated with higher photocurrent, or higher performance. Bismuth Vanadate has also been studied for solar H2 generation from seawater, which is much more difficult due to the presence of contaminating ions and a more harsh corrosive environment. Oxidation form Photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) is the process by which light enables a semiconductor to promote a catalytic oxidation reaction. While a photoelectrochemical cell typically involves both a semiconductor (electrode) and a metal (counter-electrode), at sufficiently small scales, pure semiconductor particles can behave as microscopic photoelectrochemical cells. PECO has applications in the detoxification of air and water, hydrogen production, and other applications. Reaction mechanism The process by which a photon initiates a chemical reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called photocatalysis.D. Y. Goswami, Principles of solar engineering, 3rd ed. Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis, 2015. If a photon has more energy than a material's characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material‚Äîi.e., if the material acts as a catalyst for the reactions‚Äîthen the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction‚Äîfor example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems. The principal objective of photoelectrocatalysis is to provide low-energy activation pathways for the passage of electronic charge carriers through the electrode electrolyte interface and, in particular, for the photoelectrochemical generation of chemical products.H. Tributsch, \\"Photoelectrocatalysis,\\" in Photocatalysis: Fundamentals and Applications, N. Serpone and E. Pelizzetti, Eds., ed New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1989, pp. 339-383. With regard to photoelectrochemical oxidation, we may consider, for example, the following system of reactions, which constitute TiO2-catalyzed oxidation.O. Legrini, E. Oliveros, and A. Braun, \\"Photochemical processes for water treatment,\\" Chemical Reviews, vol. 93, pp. 671-698, 1993. :TiO2 (hv) ‚Üí TiO2 (e‚àí \\\\+ h+) :TiO2(h+) +RX ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ RX.+ :TiO2(h+) + H2O ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ HO. \\\\+ H+ :TiO2(h+) + OH‚àí ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ HO. :TiO2(e‚àí) + O2 ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ O2.‚àí This system shows a number of pathways for the production of oxidative species that facilitate the oxidation of the species, RX, in addition to its direct oxidation by the excited TiO2 itself. PECO concerns such a process where the electronic charge carriers are able to readily move through the reaction medium, thereby to some extent mitigating recombination reactions that would limit the oxidative process. The ‚Äúphotoelectrochemical cell‚Äù in this case could be as simple as a very small particle of the semiconductor catalyst. Here, on the ‚Äúlight‚Äù side a species is oxidized, while on the ‚Äúdark‚Äù side a separate species is reduced.D. Y. Goswami, \\"Photoelectrochemical air disinfection \\" US Patent 7,063,820 B2, 2006. Photochemical oxidation (PCO) versus PECO The classical macroscopic photoelectrochemical system consists of a semiconductor in electric contact with a counter-electrode. For N-type semiconductor particles of sufficiently small dimension, the particles polarize into anodic and cathodic regions, effectively forming microscopic photoelectrochemical cells. The illuminated surface of a particle catalyzes a photooxidation reaction, while the ‚Äúdark‚Äù side of the particle facilitates a concomitant reduction.A. J. Bard, \\"Photoelectrochemistry and heterogeneous photo-catalysis at semiconductors,\\" Journal of Photochemistry, vol. 10, pp. 59-75, 1979. Photoelectrochemical oxidation may be thought of as a special case of photochemical oxidation (PCO). Photochemical oxidation entails the generation of radical species that enable oxidation reactions, with or without the electrochemical interactions involved in semiconductor-catalyzed systems, which occur in photoelectrochemical oxidation. Applications PECO may be useful in treating both air and water.L. C. Kinney and V. R. Ivanuski, \\"Photolysis mechanisms for pollution abatement,\\" 1969.D. Y. Goswami, J. Klausner, G. Mathur, A. Martin, K. Schanze, P. Wyness, et al., \\"Solar photocatalytic treatment of groundwater at Tyndall AFB: field test results,\\" in Proceedings of the... Annual Conference, American Solar Energy Society, Inc, 1993. History In 1938, Goodeve and Kitchener demonstrated the ‚Äúphotosensitization‚Äù of TiO2‚Äîe.g., as evidenced by the fading of paints incorporating it as a pigment.C. Goodeve and J. Kitchener, \\"Photosensitisation by titanium dioxide,\\" Transactions of the Faraday Society, vol. 34, pp. 570‚Äì579, 1938. In 1969, Kinney and Ivanuski suggested that a variety of metal oxides, including TiO2, may catalyze the oxidation of dissolved organic materials (phenol, benzoic acid, acetic acid, sodium stearate, and sucrose) under illumination by sunlamps. Additional work by Carey et al. suggested that TiO2 may be useful for the photodechlorination of PCBs.J. H. Carey, J. Lawrence, and H. M. Tosine, \\"Photodechlorination of PCB's in the presence of titanium dioxide in aqueous suspensions,\\" Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, vol. 16, pp. 697‚Äì701, 1976.

Original statutes of the first Gr√ºne Jugend from 1981Before 1994 there were, after the first attempts in Niedersachsen like Gr√ºne Jugend Braunschweig, founded in the spring of 1981, several state-based associations, such as the Gr√ºne Jugend Hessen, which had been founded in the spring of 1991. It used and still uses a frog as its logo. In the same spring the Gr√ºn-Alternative Jugend Baden-W√ºrttemberg was founded. Parallel to these state-based organisations was the federal Bundesjugendkontaktstelle (Abbreviated: BUJUKS), a loose network of young members and sympathisers of Die Gr√ºnen. After several years of debate, a federal green youth organisation was founded, in which the state-based organisations and the BUJUKS all merged. In 2001, the GJ became an integral part of the Die Gr√ºnen and lost its independent status. Ideology Although it has similar positions to its motherparty, there are some differences. The GJ for instance is in favour of legalisation of all drugs and the use of free software.1 Organization The GR√úNE JUGEND is a Basisgruppe within Alliance 90/The Greens ( or ). It has about 7,100 members. Some of these are members of state-based organisations, while others are direct members of the federal organisation. Membership of the youth organisation currently represents about 15% of the membership of the main party. Membership of the organisation ends in the year one becomes 27-years-old. The highest organ of the party is the federal congress, in which all members can participate and vote. It elects the board with two speakers, the editors of the party-magazine, SPUNK and the board of arbitration. There is a strict rule that the board should have an equal number of men and women and that the two speakers are of different genders. This is to ensure equal treatment. In the months that the federal congress does not meet a federal council, consisting out of two members per state-based organisations, meets. There are also several thematic fora, which work on specific themes (Europe, Democracy, Drugs, Equal treatment). The party's logo is a hedgehog. The GJ is a member of the Federation of Young European Greens.

He moved to the British Museum in 1848 and became the preferred illustrator for explorers and naturalists including David Livingstone, Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates. Wolf depicted animals accurately in lifelike postures and is considered one of the great pioneers of wildlife art. Sir Edwin Landseer thought him \\"...without exception, the best all-round animal artist who ever lived\\". Germany Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis Joseph was the first son of a farmer, Anton Wolf, and was born in M√∂rz, near M√ºnstermaifeld, then in Rhenish Prussia, not far from the river Moselle, in the Eifel region. He was originally called Mathias but later went by the name of Joseph. In his boyhood he assiduously studied bird and animal life, and showed a remarkable capacity as a draughtsman of natural history subjects. He showed an early talent for art by cutting paper silhouettes of birds and animals which he pasted onto windows. He later took an interest in hunting. He made himself brushes from the fur of a stone marten, and drew illustrations of birds that he raised from the nest or found near his home. He took a special interest in birds of prey, and considered art as a career but realized at the age of sixteen that he needed more training to be professional. With support from his father he was apprenticed to a firm of lithographers, Gebr√ºder Becker at Koblenz. Here he found his first illustrated ornithology book (by Johann Conrad Susemihl‚Äîhe went on to illustrate a later edition of it in the collection of a trader with an interest in birds, and was surprised by the poor quality of the plates). He returned home after three years of apprenticeship, and for a while took up a temporary job with the village headman in searching homes for illegally concealed liquor. Wolf travelled to Frankfurt and introduced himself as a lithographer to the ornithologist Eduard R√ºppell. R√ºppell was just beginning to work on the birds of Abyssinia and he encouraged Wolf to work for him either by living in Frankfurt or Darmstadt where he suggested Wolf could work for Johann Jakob Kaup. Wolf moved to Darmstadt but went on working on R√ºppell's The Birds of North-East Africa. Kaup was impressed by his abilities and took one of Wolf's sketchbooks to a meeting in Leyden to show to Hermann Schlegel at the Natural History Museum, Leiden. Schlegel immediately commissioned Wolf to work on some plates for Trait√© de Fauconnerie. The result was a set of \\"magnificent paintings of birds of prey in life size\\" which established Wolf's reputation in Europe. Plate from Trait√© de fauconnerie, which contains Wolf's first published worksAt the age of 20, Wolf was to appear at Maien to join the Army. As a fit young man with sharp-shooting abilities he could not be rejected, but it was peacetime and the surgeon, who knew him, helped him avoid recruitment under the pretext of a weak chest. Back in Darmstadt, Wolf went on working on bird plates, and joined an art school where he worked on portraits, landscapes and copying of works in the Darmstadt Gallery. He was a keen observer of wild birds and once had a pit dug in which he sat all day to watch the courtship of black grouse. In 1847, he left Darmstadt to join the Antwerp Academy to learn the Dutch oil painting techniques. Around this time, Kaup visited the British Museum, he was asked about the German artist who did the plates for Schlegel's book, and Wolf was invited to London to illustrate the genera of birds for a book by George Robert Gray. London Wolf travelled to London on 20th March 1848 on the Soho, and was introduced by David William Mitchell, an amateur illustrator himself and a secretary of the Zoological Society of London, to Tr√ºbner of Longmans publishing. The very next day was set to work on Gray's The Genera of Birds. While at work in the insect room of the British Museum, he met other naturalists including J. O. Westwood with whom he could converse in French. He was a friend of William Russell, an accountant and a Campbell related to the Duke of Argyll. Russell brought Sir Edwin Landseer and the Duke of Argyll to see the works of Wolf. The Duke soon became a patron and he was also introduced to the Duke of Westminster. Wolf's paintings were also appreciated by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of London. 250x250px John Gould admired Wolf and would have liked him on his staff, but Wolf only contributed illustrations on a freelance basis. Wolf accompanied Gould on a collection trip to Norway. Wolf thought of Gould as a shrewd and uncouth man. Wolf also noted that Gould lacked a knowledge of feather patterning, apart from knowing nothing about composition, with a tendency to add too much colour, claiming that specimens in the wild were brighter. Wolf was commissioned by the Zoological Society of London to paint a watercolour of wapiti deer in the snow; it is dated January 1881. Wolf soon became the illustrator of choice for all the books published by returning adventurers like David Livingstone, Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates (for instance Bates' 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons).Circus approximans has priority. Wolf joined an association called the German Athenaeum which was founded in 1869 and members met for scientific, literary and musical evenings. For their exhibitions he worked on a range of compositions often with natural elements. His favourite medium was charcoal and ink. Wolf became treasurer to a fund for German widows during the Franco- Prussian War (War of 1870.) After the war, he met Daniel Giraud Elliot in Paris and visited a battlefield. He rendered the image in a design called \\"Peace and War\\" with turtle doves on a bush over a soldier's helmet. He also produces some cartoon like illustrations including \\"Lecture on Embryology\\" in which he taunts certain men of science. When Charles Darwin began his study of animal expressions, he was introduced by Abraham Dee Bartlett, the zoo superintendent, to the abilities of Wolf in illustrating minute details of animals in action. Darwin requested Wolf to make some illustrations from photographs and living animals in the zoological garden. Wolf held his own opinions on the reliability of others' observations and even doubted Darwin's interpretation of the face of a monkey as a \\"laugh\\". Darwin visited him on several occasions and Wolf appreciated him for being very approachable, someone that even \\"a child could talk to\\". Impact upright Wolf's abilities were widely acclaimed even in his lifetime. Wolf established wildlife art as a genre and his observation of living birds allowed him to produce illustrations in very accurate and lifelike stances. On occasion he would come back from a trip and produce very accurate sketches from memory. He was very careful in his observation of feather patterns and when he read the works of Sundevall and Nitzsch on pterylography, he had nothing new to learn. The zoologist Alfred Newton called him \\"the greatest of all animal painters\\", while Landseer said that Wolf must have been a bird before he became a man. Wolf made numerous drawings in pen and charcoal as well as lithographs for scholarly societies such as the Zoological Society of London (he produced 340 \\"attractive\\" colour plates for the ZSL Proceedings in the course of 30 years), and a very large number of illustrations for books on natural history and travel published from various countries; and was considerably successful as a painter as well. Until 1946, the cover of the journal Ibis carried a woodcut by Wolf of an ibis against a background with ruins, a pyramid and a rising sun. In 1946 the sun was removed from the background; the design was entirely changed in 1948 due to excessive wear of the block. In 1865, J. H. Gurney named a species of harrier after Wolf, but it was found to be an already described species. Wolf died in London, surrounded by his pet birds. He is buried in Highgate East cemetery. In 2002, a new road in M√∂rz, \\"Joseph Wolf Weg\\", was named after the artist. Wolf had four daughters, two of whom had children. His direct descendants live in the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand.

It was founded in 1975 as Industrial Association, –∞ holding that incorporated ZAZ, MeMZ, Illichivsk Automobile Parts Plant () and a number of other automobile- production facilities in Lutsk (LuAZ) and Kherson. It is the only enterprise in Ukraine having full-scale cycle of passenger cars production. History In the 1990s, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company, although 100% of shares stayed with the government. In 1998 AvtoZAZ formed a joint venture with Daewoo Motors, named AvtoZAZ-Daewoo (–ê–≤—Ç–æ–ó–ê–ó-–î–ï–£). ZAZ was included in the deal as 50% share on the behalf of AvtoZAZ. Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motors in 2001, Daewoo was bought out by General Motors, however GM refused to acquire overseas manufacturing subsidiaries including AutoZAZ-Daewoo; the Daewoo part was later bought out by a Swiss investment company in 2003. Since the 2000s (decade), the state-owned 82% of AvtoZAZ shares were trusted to Ukrainian Automobile Corporation (UkrAVTO). In 2002, the corporation bought these shares and merged AvtoZAZ with ZAZ.

It is the youth wing of the South Schleswig Voter Federation. Names The official name of the organization is Sydslesvigsk Vaelgerforenings Kingdom in Danish and Jug-end mi Schlesinger Overbalanced in German. The corresponding abbreviations are SSWUnigdom and Jug-end i'm SSW, respectively. There is no official English name, but a rough translation of the German name is Youth in the South Schlesinger Voter Federation, abbreviated to Youth in the SSW.Graenseforeningen Positions According to their own description,https://www.facebook.com/SSWUngdom?sk=info the Youth in the SSW are non-ideological. Instead, they choose to let their political positions be determined by three factors. Members must: * Be young. * Have a connection to Denmark and Northern Europe. * Be part of an ethnic minority. Four key principles are used to determine their positions on a given matter: * They defend the right of every human being to choose one's own path. * They aspire to establish a welfare state in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany similar to those found in Scandinavia. * They are attached to the region where they live (as opposed to those parts of Germany where the minority rights of the Danish population group do not apply), and wish to see it developed together with its old Danish counterpart, South Jutland County. * Due to their youth and attachment to their home region, they wish to have the state actively defend the environment. History Historically, the SSW has had various informal youth groups, but these tended to disband as their members left Southern Schleswig to study in the larger cities of Denmark or Germany. In 2009, Manuel J. Thomsen established Youth in the SSW with the aim of providing a more permanent youth organization. The new group held their first National Convention in 2010, where the members adopted their first by-laws, adopted their first political program, and elected their first Board, with Lukas A. Lausen as Chairman. Under Lausen, the youth wing increased its membership five-fold, doubled its budget, and formalized a relationship with the press. At the National Convention of 2011, the by-laws were changed to allow the creation of local branches, and the second National Board was elected under the chairmanship of Jonas Knickmeier. Structure Internal The Youth in the SSW consists of two local branches (one in Flensburg and one in Schleswig) and the national federation. The local branches, or districts, are responsible for local politics, recruiting new members and arranging informative and social gatherings. The national federation is responsible for communications and national politics. On both levels, the members gather once a year for a local or national convention in order to discharge the old board, elect a new one and debate the challenges of the coming year. The National Board consists of the chairperson and two deputies. Additionally, an indeterminate number of ordinary board members are also elected every year. The same goes for the Local Board, which is usually smaller than the National counterpart. Relations to the SSW Legally, the Youth in the SSW is a working group within the mother party, which means it is not an independent organization. Nevertheless, it chooses its own course, without further interference from the SSW. Furthermore, all members of the SSW under the age of 26 are members of the Youth Wing and vice versa. It sees itself as the political voice of the youth in the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig, and as responsible for making the ideas and political beliefs of that demographic clearly visible in the actions of the political representation of the minority. Therefore, it primarily functions within the larger framework of the SSW. Some elected officials of the youth wing are ex officio members of the organs of the mother party, whereas other members of the Youth in the SSW get elected to these organs in their own right. For example, the members of the youth wing elect three delegates to the National Convention of the SSW, but nothing prohibits SSW members under the age of 26 from being elected delegates by their local party branches. Financially, the bonds are tight. Eighty percent of the youth wing's budget comes from the mother party, which is expected to decrease as government institutions on different administrative levels increase their shares.

He has come to be regarded as one of the world's leading performers and interpreters of both baroque and modern cello works. He plays a 1760 Giovanni Battista Guadagnini cello and a 1710 Rombouts baroque cello. Early life Pieter Wispelwey was born in Haarlem and grew up in Santpoort. From a very early age he was exposed to the sounds of his father's amateur string quartet when they rehearsed at the Wispelwey home. He began on the piano, but later took up the cello at age eight. Later on he took lessons from Dicky Boeke and Anner Bylsma in Amsterdam, followed by studies with Paul Katz in the USA and William Pleeth in the UK. Career His first recording with Channel Classics Records, the Bach Cello Suites, received considerable acclaim upon its release in 1990. He released two further recordings of the suites in 1998 (Channel Classics) and 2012 (Evil Penguin Records). The support of Channel Classics in the 1990s and 2000s enabled him to record his own choice of repertoire, with his own choice of artists and orchestras. This resulted in recordings of unusual repertoire, such as Franz Schubert violin sonatinas, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin waltzes, mazurkas and preludes and the Bach Gamba sonatas played with his own personal instrumentations. Wispelwey has appeared as a recitalist all over the world, including at the Concertgebouw (Amsterdam), Wigmore Hall (London), Ch√¢telet (Paris), Teatro Col√≥n (Buenos Aires) and Sydney Opera House. He has performed with many orchestras and ensembles, both with and without a conductor. Notable projects without conductor have been the touring and recording of the Schumann and Shostakovich cello concertos with the Australian Chamber Orchestra under Richard Tognetti. He has also appeared with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Russian National Symphony, Camerata Academica Salzburg, Mahler Chamber Orchestra and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and others and has recorded with the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic. Playing style Wispelwey is comfortable playing the modern cello with either metal or gut strings as well as the baroque four- and five-string cello, which allows him a repertoire ranging from Bach to Elliott Carter. Growing up exposed to gut strings as the norm like many others of his generation, Wispelwey developed a conviction that, under the right conditions, much of the 18th- and 19th-century string repertoire sounds superior when played on gut strings instead of metal. However, he is not a purist, and he plays on steel strings if conditions make it sound better than gut strings. He has been praised for his \\"intelligent, penetrating musicianship and lyrical commitment,\\" and Ivan Hewett, writer for the Telegraph and teacher at the Royal College of Music, likened him to a \\"master rhetorician.\\" Personal life Since the age of 19 he has resided in Amsterdam.

The lyrics tell of the singer's troubled past with his love, Irene, and express his sadness and frustration. Several verses refer explicitly to suicidal fantasies, most famously in the line \\"sometimes I take a great notion to jump in the river and drown,\\" which was the inspiration for the 1964 Ken Kesey novel Sometimes a Great Notion and a song of the same name from John Mellencamp's 1989 album, Big Daddy, itself strongly informed by traditional American folk music.  Lead Belly's version  John Lomax recorded a version of Huddie Ledbetter's song \\"Irene\\" in 1933, on a prison visit to Angola (Louisiana State Penitentiary). These recordings for the Library of Congress included three takes of \\"Irene\\". As part of the Federal Art Project that began in 1935, the song was published in 1936, in Lomax's version, as \\"Goodnight, Irene\\", a joint Ledbetter-Lomax composition. It has a straightforward verse‚Äìchorus form, but is in waltz time. It is a three-chord song, characterised as a \\"folk ballad\\" with a three-phrase melody, with provenance in 19th-century popular music transmitted by oral tradition. \\"Irene\\" has been styled by Neil V. Rosenberg a \\"folk recomposition\\" of the 1886 song \\"Irene Good Night\\" by Gussie L. Davis.Neil V. Rosenberg, Review: Lead Belly Reissues as Sound Documentary: From Item to Event, The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 116, No. 460 (Spring, 2003), pp. 219-229, at p. 219. Published by: University of Illinois Press on behalf of American Folklore Society \\"Irene, Good Night\\", Words and Music by Gussie L. Davis New York: M. Witmark & Sons, 1892. Library of Congress Call Number M1622.D, online Hank Williams connected the melody to the English ballad tradition, via a mountain song he knew as \\"Pere Ellen\\". Lead Belly's account was of performing \\"Irene\\" by 1908, in a way he learned from his uncles Ter(r)ell and Bob. By the 1930s he had made the song his own, modifying the rhythm and rewriting most of the verses. John and Alan Lomax made a field recording of Bob Ledbetter's version of the song. Lead Belly continued performing the song during his prison terms. An extended version of the song that includes narratives connecting the verses appears in Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly.Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly, Transcribed, Selected and Edited by John A. Lomax and Alan Lomax, New York: The Macmillan Company, 1936, pp. 235-242. In 1941 Woody Guthrie used the melody for his New Deal anthem Roll On, Columbia, Roll On. \\"Irene\\" remained a staple of Lead Belly's performances throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 2002, Lead Belly's Library of Congress recording received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.  Version by The Weavers  In 1950, one year after Lead Belly's death, the American folk band The Weavers recorded a version of \\"Goodnight, Irene\\". It was a B-side track on the Decca label, produced by Milt Gabler. The arranger was Gordon Jenkins. It was a national hit, as was the A-side, a version of Tzena, Tzena, Tzena; sales were recorded as 2 million copies. The single first reached the Billboard Best Sellers in Stores chart on June 30, 1950 and lasted 25 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1 for 13 weeks. Although generally faithful, the Weavers chose to omit some of Lead Belly's lyrics, leading Time magazine to label it a \\"dehydrated\\" and \\"prettied up\\" version of the original. The Weavers' lyrics are the ones now generally used. and Billboard ranked this version as the No. 1 song of 1950. Covers After The Weavers' success, many other artists released versions of the song, some of which were commercially successful in several genres. Frank Sinatra's cover, released a month after The Weavers', lasted nine weeks on the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 10, peaking at #5. Later that same year, Ernest Tubb and Red Foley had a #1 country music record with the song, and the Alexander Brothers, Dennis Day and Jo Stafford released versions which made the Best Seller chart, peaking at #26, #17 and #9 respectively. Moon Mullican had a number 5 country hit with it in 1950, and a version by Paul Gayten and his Orchestra reached number 6 on the Billboard R&B; chart in the same year. On the Cash Box chart, where all available versions were combined in the standings, the song reached a peak position of #1 on September 2, 1950, and lasted at #1 for 13 weeks. The song was the basis for the 1950 parody called \\"Please Say Goodnight to the Guy, Irene\\" by Ziggy Talent. It also inspired the 1954 \\"answer\\" record \\"Wake Up, Irene\\" by Hank Thompson, a #1 on Billboard's country chart. Television host Jack Narz recorded his version of \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" for his album Sing the Folk Hits With Jack Narz in 1959. Roots musician Ry Cooder performed a version of the song on his album Chicken Skin Music in 1976, which was released as a single in the Netherlands only, where it failed to chart. Rolling Stones lead guitarist Keith Richards played his version with the X-Pensive Winos on his third solo album Crosseyed Heart in 2015. Leon Russell recorded a cover of the song on his 1973 album Hank Wilson's Back Vol. I. Bryan Ferry recorded a cover of the song for his 2002 album Frantic Other artists who have recorded this song include James Booker, Dr. John, Tom Waits, John Sebastian, Levon Helm, and Eric Clapton.  Other hit versions  * 1959: Billy Williams reached number 75 on the US Billboard pop chart. * 1962: Jerry Reed reached number 79 on the US pop chart.  Use in football  \\"Goodnight Irene\\" is sung by supporters of English football team Bristol Rovers. It was first sung at a fireworks display at the Stadium the night before a Home game against Plymouth Argyle in 1950. During the game, the following day, Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of \\"Goodnight Argyle\\" from the Rovers supporters‚Äîthe tune stuck and \\"Goodnight Irene\\" became the club song.  Other uses  In season 1, episode 2 of The Eric Andre Show (2012), Russell Brand (impersonated by Semere Ab-Etmet Yohannes) sings the song during his interview. In professional wrestling, \\"Adorable\\" Adrian Adonis frequently referred to his finishing move‚Äîa standard sleeperhold‚Äîas \\"Goodnight, Irene.\\" In the 1997 movie Kiss the Girls, featuring Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, the song \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" plays in the background during the scene in which Judd's character is attacked in her kitchen by the antagonist, a serial killer. In the comic Li'l Abner, the character Mammy Yokum has a \\"lethal right undercut punch\\" called the \\"good night Irene punch\\". \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" is sung as part of a student protest depicted in the 1967 movie Sing a Song of Sex (Nihon Shunka-K≈ç), directed by Nagisa Oshima. In the novel Housekeeping (1980), written by Marilynne Robinson, both Sylvie and Helen sing the song several times. The 1993 Moxy Fruvous recording \\"The Drinking Song\\" includes a reference to \\"Goodnight Irene\\": :Sang a few bars of some pretty old song. :Irene good night. Irene goodnight :Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene :I'll see you in my dreams. \\"Goodnight Irene\\" makes an appearance in the 2013 video game BioShock Infinite (which is set in 1912), during the introductory \\"raffle\\" scene. It is sung in the background by the crowd of people at the raffle, until Booker DeWitt approaches. Canadian children's entertainer and songwriter Raffi sang a version of ‚ÄúGoodnight, Irene‚Äù on his 1979 album The Corner Grocer Store. In this lullaby children's version, he described the sleeping locations of various animals in many different environments. Michael Stanley alluded to the song in his 1973 \\"Rosewood Bitters,\\" with the lyric \\"Goodnight, Irene, my dear\\"; Joe Walsh renders the line in his quasi-rewritten cover of this song as \\"Goodnight, Irene, goodnight.\\" See also * \\"If It Had Not Been For Jesus\\", a Christian gospel sung to the same tune, first recorded in 1930 by Blind Willie Johnson References *Oliver, Paul (1984).

Friedrich Simon Archenhold (2 October 1861 in Lichtenau, Westphalia ‚Äì 14 October 1939 in Berlin) was an astronomer who founded the Treptow Observatory (today the Archenhold Observatory) in Berlin- Treptow. He graduated from the Realgymnasium in Lippstadt before entering Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1882, where he and Wilhelm F√∂rster founded the Urania Astronomical Society at the Berlin University Observatory. Largest telescope On the basis of Archenhold's plans, the world's longest moving refracting telescope was built with a focal length of 21 meters. The telescope was part of the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin. The giant telescope was constructed in Treptow, a suburb of Berlin. The telescope was opened to the public on 1 May 1896 in a temporary wooden structure which was completed in September. By 1908 Archenhold had raised the funds to replace the wooden structure with the building that stands today. Some of the funds came from admission fees to lectures but he also was able to secure funds from the Scottish American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Archenhold was able to attract numerous well-known scientists and researchers for guest lectures at the Observatory. Perhaps the most famous was Albert Einstein who gave his first public lecture on the Theory of Relativity on 2 June 1915. During 1920 Dr. Archenhold bought a fisherman's house with adobe walls and wooden cladding in the Baltic village of Bansin. When the long summer nights reduced his observation time F. S. Archenhold would take his family to his summer house in Bansin. Here he worked on the magazines and papers that he published at the observatory. By 1938 the Nazi party confiscated the home from the family. His widow Alice Archenhold and daughter Hilde died at Theresienstadt. When the Russians defeated the Nazis the property was used by the community. The Observatory was named after Archenhold in 1946 as the (Archenhold Observatory). The Archenhold family had no right to recover any of the 125 acres of land or house until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. His summer house on Seestra√üe, 63 is still standing, but it is in very poor condition. The old house in Bansin is now owned by the grand daughter of Dr. Archenhold. After the reunification of Germany the Archenhold Observatory became part of the Deutsches Technikmuseum.

This school has been an all boys school for almost 500 years but in 2018, it became coeducational. The sixth form has been coeducational for about 30 years and soon the crypt school will be fully coeducational. In 2018 (the first coeducational year) the school allowed about 1/3 year seven girls, and 2/3 year seven boys, allowing 150 new students into the school. The school was founded in 1539 by Joan Cooke with money inherited from her husband John.John and Joan Cooke. Living Gloucester, 2011. Retrieved 23 June 2011. History Founders John Cooke (d. 1528) was a wealthy brewer and mercer of Gloucester, one of the City's earliest aldermen, serving as sheriff in 1494 and 1498. He held the office of mayor four times, in 1501, 1507, 1512 and 1518. He was a great benefactor of the City. His will started the process in motion for the establishment of a grammar school in Gloucester, and the scheme was finally given effect by his wife Joan who survived him by 17 years, dying in 1545. It was Joan therefore who created the tripartite deed of 1539, deemed to be the founding charter. The school remains today the most ancient in Gloucester. A full account of the couple and their good works is contained within the book by Roland Austin published in 1939 \\"Crypt School\\". A contemporaneous portrait of the pair, John in his mayoral robe, shaking hands in union, is held within the collection of Gloucester City Council.  Site  In the school's 500-year history it has been sited in three different locations within the city of Gloucester. The original school was part of St Mary de Crypt Church in Southgate Street and the schoolroom can still be seen there. Later, in 1889, the school moved to Greyfriars, known better as Friar's Orchard, and in 1943, to its present site at Podsmead. The site on which the modern school is situated is land given to the school by Joan Cooke in 1539.  Status  Despite attempts to change the school, notably in the 1960s with the move to comprehensive schools, the Crypt remains a selective boys grammar school. In 1987, there was the admission of girls in the sixth form entering in at the age of 16. Since April 2011, the school has been an academy independent of local authority control. The school has been fully co-educational since 2018.  Primary school  In May 2018, the school announced plans to create a primary school, linked to the secondary school being built on the current Podsmead site. The new primary school would, unlike main school, be unselective and would be a free school.  Facilities  Facilities at the school include: * Largest non-commercial stage in Gloucestershire * Sixth Form Centre (also known as John and Joan Cooke Centre) * Sports hall * Modern Pavilion * New Tennis and Netball courts as of 2019/20 * 3 full-size rugby pitches * 2 football pitches * 2 cricket fields (1 natural green, 1 artificial green) * Engineering Block, also known as E block * Notable former pupils :Alumni of the school are known as Old Cryptians.

It opened in March 2002. Billed as \\"the world's only submarium\\", the exhibits contain thousands of sea creatures (including seven species of shark), of water and of salt housed in a building designed by Sir Terry Farrell and built as part of the UK National Lottery's Millennium Commission project. The Deep is also a landmark centre for marine research. A team of aquarists look after the animals in The Deep's collection as well as carrying out research into the marine environment. In 2013, the aquarium was voted the best family place to visit in Hull. The Deep is a charitable public aquarium dedicated to increasing people's enjoyment and understanding of the world's oceans. History A view of The Deep from the base of the River Hull tidal barrier Situated at the confluence of two rivers, Sammy's Point has a history going back at least to the 16th century, when Hull Castle was built on part of the site. Parts of this were made into a new fortification (The Citadel) in 1681. When the Victoria Dock was built in 1850, mud that was dug up for the dock was used to extend the foreshore and create the land that now holds The Deep. Sammy's Point was named for Martin Samuelson, who built a shipyard there in 1857. The land was bought by a succession of owners, all in the ship business, and was then used by the Humber Conservancy as a buoy depot, but was abandoned in the 1980s. About half of the financing for the aquarium was from the Millennium Commission, with the rest of the ¬£52.285 million for initial construction coming from various other sources. Operational funding is from membership, ticket, and retail sales. The building was designed by Sir Terry Farrell, and constructed by Mero-Schmidlin (UK) PLC: it took 17 months to build and was finished in 2001. The aquarium opened to the public in 2002. Over eight million people have visited the facility since its opening. In 2013, the aquarium was voted the best family place to visit in Hull. The draw for the Third Round Proper of the FA Cup took place on 8 December 2014 at The Deep and was broadcast live on BBC Two. As part of Made in Hull, the opening season of Hull UK City of Culture 2017 that ran from 1‚Äì7 January 2017, Arrivals and Departures was projected onto The Deep. Exhibits Lagoon, top view Viewing one of the large tanks The aquarium uses a combination of hands-on interactive displays, audiovisual presentations, and living exhibits to tell the story of the world's oceans. The museum includes a series of exhibits presenting a chronological journey from the beginning of time through the present day oceans. There is also an interactive area where visitors can learn to control an underwater diving vessel. Aquaria exhibits include the Tropical Lagoon of Light, teeming with brightly coloured tropical fish and rays, a Endless Oceans exhibit containing of water, Europe's deepest viewing tunnel at , and a glass lift through the tank. The tank is home to sharks, rays and northern Europe's only pair of green sawfish along with many other fish. The sharks and rays are fed by divers in a daily show. Other marine life on display include fish that glow in the dark, coral, turtles, jellyfish, frogs, penguins, an Amazon flooded forest and many species of insects. Education The aquarium's education programme hosts 30,000 primary and secondary school students each year. Some of the themes covered in these programmes include food chains, caring for the marine environment, predator-prey relationships, adaptations, and habitats. The Deep also hosts group sleepovers and a variety of special events during the year. Two Rivers Restaurant From 2002 until the Coronovirus Pandemic in 2020, The Deep was also home to the \\"Two Rivers Restaurant\\", described as one of the most unusual restaurants Hull has to offer. It was located in the heart of the aquarium. The menu was inspired by locally sourced and sustainable ingredients and diners could watch fish swim past in the tank next to them. In 2020 a message from the company put on their website and social media pages explained \\"Whilst we have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare The Deep for opening according to current government guidelines, we have unfortunately had to make the sad decision that due to the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic that the Two Rivers restaurant will not be reopening. This decision does not affect our wedding, corporate products and exclusive dine for which we are still taking enquiries and offering virtual viewings.\\" The Deep Business Centre To aid the funding of The Deep, The Deep Business Centre was set up. Opening in 2001 The Deep Business Centre has been the home for a wide variety of different companies including aeronautical, logistics, education and training, call centres, lawyers and cleaning providers. Along with offering fully serviced office spaces to organisations, The Deep Business Centre offers 'Pods' which are permanent/semi permanent desk spaces and 'hot desking' which are temporary desk spaces.

Biography Born at Fort Apache, Arizona, Upham was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 6 September 1889 and graduated on 2 June 1893. Following the completion of the two required years of postgraduate sea duty‚Äîwhich he served with the Pacific Squadron in the protected cruiser ‚ÄîUpham was commissioned an ensign on 1 July 1895 and joined the protected cruiser on 18 July before she sailed for the Far East to become the flagship of the Asiatic Squadron. At the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Upham was on the staff of the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Squadron, Commodore George Dewey; and the young officer received his baptism of fire during the Battle of Manila Bay. He advanced up the officer ranks of the Navy, eventually attaining flag rank in 1927. During the years before World War I, Upham's sea duty embraced tours in the battleships , , and ; he also commanded Olympia and the yacht . He served tours of duty ashore at Newport, Rhode Island, at the Naval War College and in Washington at the Bureau of Ordnance. His overseas shore duty began in the summer of 1911, when he took up the duties of Assistant Naval Attache at Tokyo and Peking, shortly before the outbreak of the Chinese Revolution in October of that year. During World War I, Upham commanded the cruisers and Pueblo and earned the Navy Cross for leading the latter during the \\"difficult, exacting, and hazardous\\" convoy escort missions across the Atlantic. In the years following the armistice, Capt. Upham was Chief of Staff to the Commander, Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet‚ÄîRear Admiral Hilary P. Jones‚Äîbefore serving successive tours of shore duty: in Paris as naval attache and in Washington assigned to the Office of Naval Intelligence. He commanded the battleship from September 1924-March 1926 and subsequently filled the billet of commandant of the naval air station at Pensacola, Florida. He capitalized on this assignment to earn his naval aviation observer's wings. Reaching flag rank in June 1927, Upham successively commanded Battleship Division 3 and Submarine Divisions, Control Force, and served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. Given the temporary rank of admiral on 18 August 1933, Upham returned to the Far East as Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and broke his flag in the heavy cruiser commanded by then-Capt. Chester W. Nimitz. Relieved by Admiral Orin G. Murfin in October 1935, Upham returned to the U.S. to serve as chairman of the General Board from 20 December 1935 ‚Äì 30 September 1936. Placed on the retired list on 1 October 1936, Rear Admiral Upham died in San Francisco, California. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

They are a collection of immunoglobulin molecules that react against a specific antigen, each identifying a different epitope.  Production  The general procedure to produce polyclonal antibodies is as follows: # Antigen preparation # Adjuvant selection and preparation # Animal selection # Injection process # Blood serum extraction An antigen/adjuvant conjugate is injected into an animal of choice to initiate an amplified immune response. After a series of injections over a specific length of time, the animal is expected to have created antibodies against the conjugate. Blood is then extracted from the animal and then purified to obtain the antibody of interest. Inoculation is performed on a suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit or goat. Larger mammals are often preferred as the amount of serum that can be collected is greater. An antigen is injected into the mammal. This induces the B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen. This polyclonal IgG is purified from the mammal's serum. By contrast, monoclonal antibodies are derived from a single cell line Many methodologies exist for polyclonal antibody production in laboratory animals. Institutional guidelines governing animal use and procedures relating to these methodologies are generally oriented around humane considerations and appropriate conduct for adjuvant (agents which modify the effect of other agents while having few if any direct effects when given by themselves) use. This includes adjuvant selection, routes and sites of administration, injection volumes per site and number of sites per animal. Institutional policies generally include allowable volumes of blood per collection and safety precautions including appropriate restraint and sedation or anesthesia of animals for injury prevention to animals or personnel. The primary goal of antibody production in laboratory animals is to obtain high titer, high affinity antisera for use in experimentation or diagnostic tests. Adjuvants are used to improve or enhance an immune response to antigens. Most adjuvants provide for an injection site, antigen depot which allows for a slow release of antigen into draining lymph nodes. Many adjuvants also contain or act directly as: # surfactants which promote concentration of protein antigens molecules over a large surface area, and # immunostimulatory molecules or properties. Adjuvants are generally used with soluble protein antigens to increase antibody titers and induce a prolonged response with accompanying memory. Such antigens by themselves are generally poor immunogens. Most complex protein antigens induce multiple B-cell clones during the immune response, thus, the response is polyclonal. Immune responses to non-protein antigens are generally poorly or enhanced by adjuvants and there is no system memory. Antibodies are currently also being produced from isolation of human B-lymphocytes to produce specific recombinant monoclonal antibody mixtures. The biotechnology company, Symphogen, develops this type of antibodies for therapeutic applications. They are the first research company to reach phase two trials with the monoclonal antibody mixtures that mimic the diversity of the polyclonal antibody drugs. This production prevents viral and prion transmission and this is the simple process.  Animal selection  Animals frequently used for polyclonal antibody production include chickens, goats, guinea pigs, hamsters, horses, mice, rats, and sheep. However, the rabbit is the most commonly used laboratory animal for this purpose. Animal selection should be based upon: # the amount of antibody needed, # the relationship between the donor of the antigen and the recipient antibody producer (generally the more distant the phylogenetic relationship, the greater the potential for high titer antibody response) and # the necessary characteristics [e.g., class, subclass (isotype), complement fixing nature] of the antibodies to be made. Immunization and phlebotomies are stress associated and, at least when using rabbits and rodents, specific pathogen free (SPF) animals are preferred. Use of such animals can dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to pathogenic organisms, especially Pasteurella multocida in rabbits. Goats or horses are generally used when large quantities of antisera are required. Many investigators favor chickens because of their phylogenetic distance from mammals. Chickens transfer high quantities of IgY (IgG) into the egg yolk and harvesting antibodies from eggs eliminates the need for the invasive bleeding procedure. One week's eggs can contain 10 times more antibodies than the volume of rabbit blood obtained from one weekly bleeding. However, there are some disadvantages when using certain chicken derived antibodies in immunoassays. Chicken IgY does not fix mammalian complement component C1 and it does not perform as a precipitating antibody using standard solutions. Although mice are used most frequently for monoclonal antibody production, their small size usually prevents their use for sufficient quantities of polyclonal, serum antibodies. However, polyclonal antibodies in mice can be collected from ascites fluid using any one of a number of ascites producing methodologies. When using rabbits, young adult animals (2.5‚Äì3.0 kg or 5.5‚Äì6.5 lbs) should be used for primary immunization because of the vigorous antibody response. Immune function peaks at puberty and primary responses to new antigens decline with age. Female rabbits are generally preferred because they are more docile and are reported to mount a more vigorous immune response than males. At least two animals per antigen should be used when using outbred animals. This principle reduces potential total failure resulting from non- responsiveness to antigens of individual animals. Antigen preparation The size, extent of aggregation and relative nativity of protein antigens can all dramatically affect the quality and quantity of antibody produced. Small polypeptides (<10 ku) and non-protein antigens generally need to be conjugated or crosslinked to larger, immunogenic, carrier proteins to increase immunogenicity and provide T cell epitopes. Generally, the larger the immunogenic protein the better. Larger proteins, even in smaller amounts, usually result in better engagement of antigen presenting antigen processing cells for a satisfactory immune response. Injection of soluble, non-aggregated proteins has a higher probability of inducing tolerance rather than a satisfactory antibody response. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin are two widely used carrier proteins. Poly-L-lysine has also been used successfully as a backbone for peptides. Although the use of Poly-L- lysine reduces or eliminates production of antibodies to foreign proteins, it may result in failure of peptide-induced antibody production. Recently, liposomes have also been successfully used for delivery of small peptides and this technique is an alternative to delivery with oily emulsion adjuvants.  Antigen quantity  Selection of antigen quantity for immunization varies with the properties of the antigen and the adjuvant selected. In general, microgram to milligram quantities of protein in adjuvant are necessary to elicit high titer antibodies. Antigen dosage is generally species, rather than body weight, associated. The so-called ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of immunogenicity in each species is broad but too much or too little antigen can induce tolerance, suppression or immune deviation towards cellular immunity rather than a satisfactory humoral response. Optimal and usual protein antigen levels for immunizing specific species have been reported in the following ranges: # rabbit, 50‚Äì1000 ¬µg; # mouse, 10‚Äì50 ¬µg; # guinea pig, 50‚Äì500 ¬µg; and # goat, 250‚Äì5000 ¬µg. Optimal ‚Äúpriming‚Äù doses are reported to be at the low end of each range. The affinity of serum antibodies increases with time (months) after injection of antigen-adjuvant mixtures and as antigen in the system decreases. Widely used antigen dosages for ‚Äúbooster‚Äù or secondary immunizations are usually one half to equal the priming dosages. Antigens should be free of preparative byproducts and chemicals such as polyacrylamide gel, SDS, urea, endotoxin, particulate matter and extremes of pH.  Peptide antibodies  When a peptide is being used to generate the antibody, it is extremely important to design the antigens properly. There are several resources that can aid in the design as well as companies that offer this service. Expasy has aggregated a set of public tools under its ProtScale page that require some degree of user knowledge to navigate. For a more simple peptide scoring tool there is a Antigen Profiler tool available that will enable you to score individual peptide sequences based upon a relation epitope mapping database of previous immunogens used to generate antibodies. Finally, as a general rule peptides should follow some basic criteria. When examining peptides for synthesis and immunization, it is recommended that certain residues and sequences be avoided due to potential synthesis problems. This includes some of the more common characteristics: * Extremely long repeats of the same amino acid (e.g. RRRR) * Serine (S), Threonine (T), Alanine (A), and Valine (V) doublets * Ending or starting a sequence with a proline (P) * Glutamine (Q) or Asparagine (N) at the n-terminus * Peptides over weighted with hydrophobic residues (e.g. V, A, L, I, etc....)  Reactivity  Investigators should also consider the status of nativity of protein antigens when used as immunogens and reaction with antibodies produced. Antibodies to native proteins react best with native proteins and antibodies to denatured proteins react best with denatured proteins. If elicited antibodies are to be used on membrane blots (proteins subjected to denaturing conditions) then antibodies should be made against denatured proteins. On the other hand, if antibodies are to be used to react with a native protein or block a protein active site, then antibodies should be made against the native protein. Adjuvants can often alter the nativity of the protein. Generally, absorbed protein antigens in a preformed oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, retain greater native protein structure than those in water-in-oil emulsions. Asepticity  Antigens should always be prepared using techniques that ensure that they are free of microbial contamination. Most protein antigen preparations can be sterilized by passage through a 0.22Œºm filter. Septic abscesses often occur at inoculation sites of animals when contaminated preparations are used. This can result in failure of immunization against the targeted antigen.  Adjuvants  There are many commercially available immunologic adjuvants. Selection of specific adjuvants or types varies depending upon whether they are to be used for research and antibody production or in vaccine development. Adjuvants for vaccine use only need to produce protective antibodies and good systemic memory while those for antiserum production need to rapidly induce high titer, high avidity antibodies. No single adjuvant is ideal for all purposes and all have advantages and disadvantages. Adjuvant use generally is accompanied by undesirable side effects of varying severity and duration. Research on new adjuvants focuses on substances which have minimal toxicity while retaining maximum immunostimulation. Investigators should always be aware of potential pain and distress associated with adjuvant use in laboratory animals. The most frequently used adjuvants for antibody production are Freund's, Alum, the Ribi Adjuvant System and Titermax.  Freund‚Äôs adjuvants  There are two basic types of Freund's adjuvants: Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA). FCA is a water-in-oil emulsion that localizes antigen for release periods up to 6 months. It is formulated with mineral oil, the surfactant mannide monoleate and heat killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium butyricum or their extracts (for aggregation of macrophages at the inoculation site). This potent adjuvant stimulates both cell mediated and humoral immunity with preferential induction of antibody against epitopes of denatured proteins. Although FCA has historically been the most widely used adjuvant, it is one of the more toxic agents due to non-metabolizable mineral oil and it induces granulomatous reactions. Its use is limited to laboratory animals and it should be used only with weak antigens. It should not be used more than once in a single animal since multiple FCA inoculations can cause severe systemic reactions and decreased immune responses. Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant has the same formulation as FCA but does not contain mycobacterium or its components. FIA usually is limited to booster doses of antigen since it normally much less effective than FCA for primary antibody induction. Freund's adjuvants are normally mixed with equal parts of antigen preparations to form stable emulsions.  Ribi Adjuvant System Ribi adjuvants are oil-in-water emulsions where antigens are mixed with small volumes of a metabolizable oil (squalene) which are then emulsified with saline containing the surfactant Polysorbate 80. This system also contains refined mycobacterial products (cord factor, cell wall skeleton) as immunostimulants and bacterial monophosphoryl lipid A. Three different species oriented formulations of the adjuvant system are available. These adjuvants interact with membranes of immune cells resulting in cytokine induction, which enhances antigen uptake, processing and presentation. This adjuvant system is much less toxic and less potent than FCA but generally induces satisfactory amounts of high avidity antibodies against protein antigens. Titermax Titermax represents a newer generation of adjuvants that are less toxic and contain no biologically derived materials. It is based upon mixtures of surfactant acting, linear, blocks or chains of nonionic copolymers polyoxypropylene (POP) and polyoxyethylene (POE). These copolymers are less toxic than many other surfactant materials and have potent adjuvant properties which favor chemotaxis, complement activation and antibody production. Titermax adjuvant forms a microparticulate water-in-oil emulsion with a copolymer and metabolizable squalene oil. The copolymer is coated with emulsion stabilizing silica particles which allows for incorporation of large amounts of a wide variety of antigenic materials. The adjuvant active copolymer forms hydrophilic surfaces, which activate complement, immune cells and increased expression of class II major histocompatibility molecules on macrophages. Titermax presents antigen in a highly concentrated form to the immune system, which often results in antibody titers comparable to or higher than FCA. Specol: Specol is a water in oil adjuvant made of purified mineral oil. It has been reported to induce immune response comparable to Freund's adjuvant in rabbit and other research animal while producing fewer histological lesions.

Advantages  The use of polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) over monoclonal antibodies has its advantages. The technical skills needed to produce polyclonal antibodies is not as demanding. They're inexpensive to make and can be generated fairly quickly, taking up to several months to produce. PAbs are heterogeneous, which allows them to bind to a wide range of antigen epitopes. Because PAbs are produced from a large number of B cell clones, they're more likely to successfully bind to a specific antigen. PAbs remain stable in different environments, such as a change in pH or salt concentration, which allows them to be more applicable in certain procedures. Additionally, depending on the amount needed, PAbs can be made in large quantities in relation to the size of the animal used.

He is best known for his historical novels set in France ‚Äì The Girl at the Lion d'Or, Birdsong and Charlotte Gray. He has also published novels with a contemporary setting, most recently A Week in December (2009) and Paris Echo, (2018) and a James Bond continuation novel, Devil May Care (2008), as well as a continuation of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves series, Jeeves and the Wedding Bells (2013). He was a team captain on BBC Radio 4 literary quiz The Write Stuff. Biography Early life Faulks was born on 20 April 1953 in Donnington, Berkshire, to Peter Faulks and Pamela (n√©e Lawless). His father was a decorated soldier (he won the Military Cross), who later became a solicitor and circuit judge. His brother Edward Faulks, Baron Faulks QC, a barrister, became a Conservative Government Minister in January 2014 in the Ministry of Justice. His uncle was Sir Neville Faulks, a High Court judge. He was educated at Elstree School, Reading and went on to Wellington College, Berkshire. He read English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he was made an Honorary Fellow in 2008.Profile on Faulkes' official biography Whilst at Cambridge he participated in University Challenge, in which Emmanuel College lost in the opening round. Faulks commented that his team was most probably hampered by a trip to the pub before the show, as recommended by the show's producer.As revealed in his episode of Desert Island Discs. Career After graduating, Faulks worked as a teacher at a private school in Camden Town, and then as a journalist for the Daily and Sunday Telegraph. Faulks's first novel, A Trick of the Light, was published in 1984. He continued to work as a journalist, becoming the first literary editor of The Independent in 1986.\\"A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks\\", Guardian 23 August 2009 He became deputy editor of the Independent on Sunday in 1989; in the same year he published The Girl at the Lion d'Or, the first of his historical novels set in France. In 1991 he left The Independent. He wrote for various newspapers as a freelancer for the next ten years. Following the success of Birdsong (1993), Faulks quit journalism to write full-time. He has since published eight novels, the most recent being A Possible Life (2012), Where My Heart Used to Beat (2015) and Paris Echo (2018). Faulks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993 and appointed CBE for services to literature in 2002. Faulks appears regularly on British TV and radio. He was a regular team captain on BBC Radio 4's literary quiz The Write Stuff (1998 - 2014). The quiz involves the panellists each week writing a pastiche of the work of a selected author; Faulks has published a collection of his efforts as a book, Pistache (2006), which was described in The Scotsman as \\"a little treasure of a book. Faulks can catch, and caricature, another writers' fingerprints and foibles with a delicious precision that only a deep love of writing can teach\\". In 2011 Faulks presented a four-part BBC Two series called Faulks on Fiction, looking at the British novel and its characters.Faulkes on Fiction, BBC,2011 He also wrote a series tie-in book of the same name. Personal life Faulks married Veronica (n√©e Youlten) in 1989. They have two sons, William and Arthur, born 1990 and 1996 respectively, and one daughter, Holly, born 1992. Faulks is a fan of West Ham United football club. Debrett's lists his recreations as tennis and wine. A longtime cricket fan and player, Faulks is a member of the Authors XI cricket team. In August 2014, Faulks was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. From 2013 - 2018 he sat on the Government Advisory Group for the Commemoration of the First World War.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-members-of-ww1-centenary- advisory-group-appointed Novels The Literary Review has said that \\"Faulks has the rare gift of being popular and literary at the same time\\"; the Sunday Telegraph called him \\"One of the most impressive novelists of his generation ... who is growing in authority with every book\\". Faulks's 2005 novel, Human Traces, was described by Trevor Nunn as \\"A masterpiece, one of the great novels of this or any other century.\\" Faulks is best known for his three novels set in early twentieth-century France.The first, The Girl at the Lion d'Or, was published in 1989. This was followed by Birdsong (1993), and Charlotte Gray (1998). The latter two were best-sellers, and Charlotte Gray was shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In April 2003 Birdsong came 13th in the BBC's Big Read initiative which aimed to identify Britain's best loved novels.*The Big Read from the BBC In 2007, Faulks published Engleby. Set in Cambridge in the 1970s, it is narrated by Cambridge University fresher Mike Engleby. Engleby is a loner, and the reader is led to suspect that he may be unreliable, particularly when a fellow student disappears. Faulks says of the novel's genesis, \\"I woke up one morning with this guy's voice in my head. And he was just talking, dictating, almost. And when I got to work, I wrote it down. I didn't know what the hell was going on; this wasn't an idea for a book\\". It was remarked upon as a change of direction for Faulks, both in terms of the near-contemporary setting and in the decision to use a first-person narrator.\\"Cantabrigian Psycho \\" New York Times, 16 September 2007 The Daily Telegraph said the book was \\"distinguished by a remarkable intellectual energy: a narrative verve, technical mastery of the possibilities of the novel form and vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life.\\"\\"The inside of an outsider's mind\\", Daily Telegraph, 10 May 2007 To mark the 2008 centenary of Ian Fleming's birth, the late author's estate in 2006 commissioned Faulks to write a new James Bond novel. Faulks has said of the commission, \\"I'd just finished Human Traces and it seemed ridiculous. You've just spent five years in a Victorian lunatic asylum and then you go on to James Bond. But I think their hope is they'll get two markets. The more I think about it, the more I think it was clever of them, because the mismatch is intriguing\\". The result, Devil May Care, became an immediate best-seller in the UK, selling 44,093 hardback copies within 4 days of release.\\"James Bond smashes sales figures\\", The Guardian, 4 June 2008 The Observer review of the novel said that \\"Faulks has done in some ways an absolutely sterling job. He has resisted pastiche\\", and blamed the book's weaknesses on the character of Bond as created by Fleming. Mark Lawson, writing in The Guardian, praised it as \\"a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post- Fleming Bonds, this must surely compete with Kingsley Amis's for the title of the best\\". Faulks's 2009 novel, A Week in December, takes place, in the seven days leading up to Christmas in December 2007. It focuses on the lives of a varied cast of characters living in London; Faulks himself has described the novel as \\"Dickensian\\" and cites Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend as influences, as well as New York novelists such as Tom Wolfe and Jay McInerney. The book was partly a response to the banking crisis. He chose to set it specifically in 2007 because \\"the whole world had changed: the banks were collapsing, we were facing Armageddon, and I understood then that I couldn't make this book right up to the moment[...] I chose that time because then the writing's on the wall, and it should be clear to anyone half-sensible that the game is up, but they're still going on.\\" Other plot threads in the novel concern reality television, and Islamic militancy. While publicising the book, Faulks received some criticism for negative remarks he made about the Koran; he was quick to offer \\"a simple but unqualified apology to my Muslim friends and readers for anything that has come out sounding crude or intolerant. Happily, there is more to the book than that\\". Reviews for the novel were mixed. Tibor Fischer, in The Daily Telegraph, praised the novel's \\"comic √©lan\\", but felt it was \\"uneven\\" and criticised the character of John Veals as \\"lifeless\\".\\"A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks: review\\", Daily Telegraph 10 September 2009 Mark Lawson wrote in The Guardian, \\"an honest critic must surely conclude that Faulks has correctly identified the novel that needs to be written about these times, but may also have proved that British society is now so various that no single writer can capture all its aspects. However, in honourably failing to depict the entire state of the nation, Faulks has memorably skewered the British literary world.\\"\\"A Week in December by Sebastian Faulks\\", The Guardian, 5 September 2009 Adaptations of novels In 2001 Charlotte Gray was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett and directed by Gillian Armstrong.

An invertebrate zoologist and evolutionary biologist, he held chairs at University College London and Oxford University. He was the third Director of the Natural History Museum, and was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society.  Life  Ray Lankester was born on 15 May 1847 on Burlington Street in London, the son of Edwin Lankester, a coroner and doctor-naturalist who helped eradicate cholera in London, and his wife, the botanist and author Phebe Lankester. Ray Lankester was probably named after the naturalist John Ray: his father had just edited the memorials of John Ray for the Ray Society. In 1855 Ray went to boarding school at Leatherhead, and in 1858 to St Paul's School. His university education was at Downing College, Cambridge, and Christ Church, Oxford; he transferred from Downing, after five terms, at his parents' behest because Christ Church had better teaching in the form of the newly appointed George Rolleston.Lester, pp. 17‚Äì19. Lankester achieved first-class honours in 1868. His education was rounded off by study visits to Vienna, Leipzig and Jena, and he did some work at the Stazione Zoologica at Naples. He took the examination to become a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and studied under Thomas H. Huxley before taking his MA. Lankester therefore had a far better education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it could be argued that the influence of his father Edwin and his friends were just as important. Huxley Upon Huxley's death, as a memorial tribute, Lankester and Sir Michael Foster edited his collected works in four volumes. was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.Lester, pp. 9‚Äì11. He was a large man with a large presence, of warm human sympathies and in his childhood a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln. His interventions, responses and advocacies were often colourful and forceful, as befitted an admirer of Huxley, for whom he worked as a demonstrator when a young man. In his personal manner he was not so adept as Huxley, and he made enemies by his rudeness. This undoubtedly damaged and limited the second half of his career. Lankester appears, thinly disguised, in several novels. He is the model for Sir Roderick Dover in H. G. Wells' Marriage (Wells had been one of his students), and in Robert Briffault's Europa, which contains a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with Karl Marx. (Lankester was one of the eight people at Marx's funeral.) He has also been suggested as the model for Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World,Lester, pp. 60, 187‚Äì8, 199‚Äì202. but Doyle himself said that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named William Rutherford.pxxiii in the Oxford ed of The Lost World.

In 1895, he was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest while in the company of a group of female prostitutes on the street, but was acquitted.The Professor And The Policeman, Birmingham Daily Post, 7 October 1895, p5. (It is incorrect, as has been alleged,McKenna, Neil \\"The Secret Life Of Oscar Wilde\\", Century, 2003, p. 250. that the charge concerned homosexual offences.) He died in London on 15 August 1929. A finely decorated memorial plaque to him can be seen at the Golders Green Crematorium, Hoop Lane, London.  Career  Portion of a ripe ovary of Sepia (cuttlefish) showing ova of various sizes and some empty capsules c, c. From Contributions to the developmental history of the MolluscaLankester became a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1873. He co-edited the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science which his father had founded. From 1869 until his death he edited this journal (jointly with his father, 1869‚Äì71). He worked as one of Huxley's team at the new buildings in South Kensington, and after the death of Francis Balfour became Huxley's intended successor. Lankester was appointed Jodrell Professor of Zoology and curator of what is now the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London from 1874 to 1890, Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Merton College, Oxford, from 1891 to 1898, and director of the Natural History Museum from 1898 to 1907. He was a founder in 1884 of the Marine Biological Association and served as its second President between 1890 and 1929. Influential as teacher and writer on biological theories, comparative anatomy, and evolution, Lankester studied the protozoa, mollusca, and arthropoda. He was knighted in 1907, awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1913, and the Linnean Society of London's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908.Lester. At University College London (the 'Godless Institute of Gower Street') Lankester taught Raphael Weldon (1860‚Äì1906), who went on to succeed him in the chair at UCL. Another interesting student was Alfred Gibbs Bourne, who went on to hold senior positions in biology and education in the Indian Empire. When Lankester left to take up the Linacre chair at Oxford in 1891, the Grant Museum at UCL continued to grow under Weldon who added a number of extremely rare specimens. Weldon is perhaps best known for founding the science of biometry with Francis Galton (1822‚Äì1911) and Karl Pearson (1857‚Äì1936). He followed Lankester to Oxford in 1899.History of the Grant Museum 1827 ‚Äì present. ucl.ac.uk. Ray Lankester by Leslie Ward, Vanity Fair 1905. After Huxley the most important influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected Lamarckism, and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution at a time when other biologists had doubts. Weismann's separation of germplasm (genetic material) from soma (somatic cells) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester was one of the first to see its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English. Lankester was hugely influential, though perhaps more as a teacher than as a researcher. Ernst Mayr said \\"It was Lankester who founded a school of selectionism at Oxford\\". Those he influenced (in addition to Weldon) included Edwin Stephen Goodrich (Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford 1921‚Äì46) and (indirectly) Julian Huxley (the evolutionary synthesis). In turn their disciples, such as E. B. Ford (ecological genetics), Gavin de Beer (embryology and evolution), Charles Elton (ecology) and Alister Hardy (marine biology) held sway during the middle years of the 20th century. As a zoologist Lankester was a comparative anatomist of the Huxley school, working mostly on invertebrates. He was the first to show the relationship of the horseshoe crab or Limulus to the Arachnida. His Limulus specimens can still be seen in the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL today. He was also a voluminous writer on biology for the general readership; in this he followed the example of his old mentor, Huxley. He published over 200 papers during his career. For an overview of his scientific work, see the obituary notice by Edwin S. Goodrich  Invertebrates and degeneration  Lankester's books Developmental history of the Mollusca (1875) and Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism (1880) established him as a leader in the study of invertebrate life histories. In Degeneration he adapted some ideas of Ernst Haeckel and Anton Dohrn (the founder and first director of the Stazione Zoologica, Naples).Dohrn, Anton 1875. Der Ursprung der Wirbelthiere und das Principe des Functionswechsels. Engelmann, Leipzig. Connecting Dohrn's work with Darwinism, Lankester held that degeneration was one of three general avenues that evolution might take (the others being balance and elaboration). Degeneration was a suppression of form, \\"Any new set of conditions occurring to an animal which render its food and safety very easily attained, seem to lead to as a rule to Degeneration\\".Lankester, E. Ray (1880) Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism, p. 33. Degeneration was well known in parasites, and Lankester gave several examples. In Sacculina, a genus of barnacles which is a parasite of crabs, the female is little more than \\"a sac of eggs, and absorbed nourishment from the juices of its host by root-like processes\\" (+ wood- engraved illustration). He called this degenerative evolutionary process in parasites retrogressive metamorphosis. Lankester pointed out that retrograde metamorphosis could be seen in many species that were not, strictly speaking, degenerate. \\"Were it not for the recapitulative phases of the barnacle, we may doubt whether naturalists would ever have guessed it was a crustacean.\\" The lizard Seps has limbs which are \\"ridiculously small\\", and Bipes, a burrowing lizard, has no front limbs, and rear limbs reduced to stumps. The Dibamidae are legless lizards of tropical forests who also adopt the burrowing habit. Snakes, which have evolved unique forms of locomotion, and are probably derived from lizards. Thus degeneration or retrogressive metamorphosis sometimes occurs as species adapt to changes in habit or way of life. As evidence of degeneration, Lankester identifies the recapitulative development of the individual. This is the idea propagated by Ernst Haeckel as a source of evolutionary evidence (recapitulation theory). As antecedents of degeneration, Lankester lists:Lankester, E. Ray (1880) Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism, p. 52. :1. Parasitism :2. Fixity or immobility (sessile habit) :3. Vegetative nutrition :4. Excessive reduction in size He also considered the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst still in its gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult. Lankester noted that this process could take the subsequent evolution of the race into a totally different and otherwise improbable direction.Lester, p. 87. This idea, which Lankester called super-larvation, is now called neoteny. Lankester extended the idea of degeneration to human societies, which carries little significance today, but it is a good example of a biological concept invading social science. Lankester and H. G. Wells used the idea as a basis for propaganda in favour of social and educational reform.  Trouble at the Museum  In Lankester's time the Natural History Museum had its own building in South Kensington, but in financial and administrative matters it was subordinate to the British Museum. Moreover, the Superintendent (= Director) of the NHM was the subordinate of the Principal Librarian of the BM, a fact which was bound to cause trouble since that august person was not a scientist.G√ºnther, Albert (1975) A century of zoology at the British Museum through the lives of two Keepers, 1815‚Äì1914. London. G√ºnther, Albert (1981) The founders of science at the British Museum, 1753‚Äì1900. Halesworth, London. Stearn, William T. (1981) The Natural History Museum at South Kensington. London. We can see that the conflict which took place was one aspect of the struggle undertaken, in their different ways, by Owen, Hooker, Huxley and Tyndall to emancipate science from enslavement by traditional forces. There was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, who was on the point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the palaeographer, was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended to take control of the whole Museum, including the Natural History departments.Mitchell, P. Chalmers (1937) My fill of days. London. pp. 170ff.Sir John Evans to Lankester, Lankester family papers; reported in Lester, pp. 128‚Äì9. In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, Mitchell, Poulton, and Weldon were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).Lester, Chapter 11, pp. 127ff. Lankester was appointed in 1898, and the outcome was inevitable. Eight years of conflict with Maunde Thompson followed, with Thompson constantly interfering in the affairs of the museum and obstructing Lankester's attempt to improve the museum. Lankester resigned in 1907, at the direction of Thompson, who had discovered a clause in the regulations which allowed him to call for the resignation of officials at the age of 60. Lazarus Fletcher was appointed in his stead. There was a vast clamour in the press, and from foreign zoologists protesting at the treatment of Lankester. That Lankester had some friends in high places was shown by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering him an enhanced pension, and the knighthood that was bestowed on him the next year. The issues raised by this affair did not end there. Eventually the NHM gained, first, its administrative freedom, then finally there was a complete separation from the BM. Today the British Library, the British Museum and the Natural History Museum all occupy separate buildings, and have complete legal, administrative and financial independence from each other.  Rationalism  Sir Edwin Ray Lankester in 1918 Lankester had close family connections with Suffolk (the Woodbridge and Felixstowe area), and was an active member of the Rationalist group associated with the circle of Thomas Huxley, Samuel Laing and others. He was a friend of the Rationalist Edward Clodd of Aldeburgh. From 1901 to his death in 1929 he was Honorary President of the Ipswich Museum. He became convinced of the human workmanship of the (now unfavoured) 'Pre-palaeolithic' implements and rostro- carinates, and championed their cause at the Royal Society in 1910‚Äì1912. Through correspondence he became the scientific mentor of the Suffolk prehistorian James Reid Moir (1879‚Äì1944). He was a friend of Karl Marx in the latter's later years and was among the few persons present at his funeral. Lankester was active in attempting to expose the frauds of Spiritualist mediums during the 1920s. He was an important writer of popular science, his weekly newspaper columns over many years being assembled and reprinted in a series of books entitled Science from an Easy Chair (first series, 1910; second series, 1912).  Publications  His professional writings include the following: * A Monograph of the Cephalaspidian Fishes (1870) * On comparative longevity in man and the lower animals (1870) * Contributions to the Developmental History of the Mollusca (1875) * (1880) * Limulus an Arachnid Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science Vol 21 Pages 504-548 (1881) * The Advancement of Science (1889), collected essays * A Treatise on Zo√∂logy (1900‚Äì09), (editor) ** Part 1 Introduction and Protozoa [First Fascicle] ** Part 1 Introduction and Protozoa [Second Fascicle] ** Part 2 The Porifera and Coelentera ** Part 3 The EchinodermaReview in The Zoologist, 4th series, vol 4, issue 703 (May, 1900), alt=wikisource logo p. 242/3. ** Part 4 The Platyhelmia, Mesozoa, and Nemertini ** Part 5 Mollusca ** Part 7 Appendiculata ** Part 9 Vertebrata Craniata * Extinct Animals (1905) * Nature and Man (1905) (Romanes Lecture for 1905) * The Kingdom of Man (1907) * Science from an Easy Chair (1910) * Great and Small Things (1923) * Fireside Science (1934) * Lankester, R.

Gilbert is often cited in the earliest descriptions of many Australian animals, many of which were unrecorded in European literature, and some of these are named for him by those authors. Gilbert was sent to the newly founded Swan River Colony and made collections and notes on the unique birds and mammals of the surrounding region. He later joined expeditions to remote parts the country, continuing to make records and collections until he was killed during a violent altercation at Mitchell River (Queensland) on the Cape York Peninsula. Early life John Gilbert was born on 14 March 1812 in Newington Butts, south London, England and was christened on 25 October 1812 at Spa Fields Lady Huntingdons, Clerkenwell, London. His father was William and his mother Ann, who were from nearby villages in Kent. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London, where he met John Gould. Gould had recruited Gilbert, four years his junior, to work there. But 18 months later, Gilbert was sacked for being absent without leave. Australian expeditions Gilbert travelled to Australia in 1838 with the Goulds and their young nephew Henry William Coxen. Gilbert was paid 100 pounds per annum plus expenses, but he was expected to account meticulously for every penny and to keep his expenses as small as possible. Gould and Gilbert reached Hobart on the Parsee on 19 September 1838. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. The party landed in Hobart, Tasmania in September, and in January, Gilbert and Gould traveled overland together to Launceston. Gould decided they should separate, and sent Gilbert off on 4 February 1839 to the Swan River Colony, assuring him that he would look after all his personal possessions which were still in Hobart. Gilbert was instructed to collect as many specimens as possible, then meet up again in Sydney, where Gould would wait for him until the end of April the following year. He worked mostly in the vicinity of Perth, gathering specimens for Gould for 11 months. Gilbert disembarked from the ship Comet on 6 March 1839 at Fremantle, Western Australia, the port of the colony in its first decade. He met Francis Armstrong within a few days, who was acquainted with the Nyungar peoples of the region, and began to make collections in the area around the Swan River and York. His arrival began a period of ornithological research that saw large number of his specimens described and depicted by the Goulds, many of which were \\"discovered\\", the field notes that accompanied these gave details of birds of the west that allowed inclusion in their ambitious publication. Meanwhile, Gould returned to Hobart, where his wife Elizabeth awaited him. They lived in style with their servants in Government House. Taking one servant with him, Gould visited New South Wales and was made welcome by his wife's family, the Coxens and other wealthy landlords. He returned to Hobart just in time for the birth of his seventh child (a son they named Franklin Tasman). Almost immediately, Gould set off again, this time for South Australia, where he met the Governor and accompanied Charles Sturt on his expedition to the Murray Scrubs. When he returned to Hobart, the Goulds travelled together to New South Wales, where Elizabeth's brothers lived. Gould collected many birds and mammals, some of which were new to science. The Goulds left for England on 9 April. When Gilbert arrived in Sydney on 30 April, he found his employer gone. To rub salt in his wound, his trunk had been ransacked and many of the possessions that Gould had promised to protect, had been stolen. Gilbert had provided Gould with thousands of specimens of every description, from quadrupeds to insects, from shells to crustacea, from plants to reptiles, but mainly and most importantly, birds and eggs. He had provided Gould with over 60 new species of birds, including the extinct paradise parrot which he first discovered in the Darling Downs in June 1844.Olsen, Penny (2007). Glimpses of Paradise: The Quest for the Beautiful Parakeet. Canberra: National Library of Australia. . p. 16. Gilbert travelled by boat to Port Essington, north of where Darwin is today. There, he collected, among many other things, a beautiful, newly discovered finch and returned with it to Gould in England. there he found his employer mourning his wife, Elizabeth, who had died after the birth of their eighth child. She was just 37. Gould named the finch after his wife, so Elizabeth is remembered today in this gorgeous little bird, called not Elizabeth's finch, but more cryptically, the Gouldian finch. As Elizabeth was the illustrator of all the works, not her husband, Gould then needed to recruit other artists to finish the work that Elizabeth had tirelessly begun. Gilbert soon returned to Australia to collect again for Gould. He discovered the paradise parrot and thought it 'without exception the most beautiful of the whole tribe I have ever yet seen in Australia.' He begged Gould to name it after him, saying, 'I know of no species that would delight me more to see gilbertii attached to than this beautiful bird.' Gould declined, saying he did not like naming species after people, and anyway, he had just recently named another species after him. Apparently, Gould saw no contradiction in this explanation and though the paradise parrot is now extinct, Gilbert is remembered in the Gilbert's whistler. Naming the Gilbert's whistler was one of Gould's rare ornithological mistakes. He had already named the eastern race of the same bird, calling it the 'unadorned thickhead', perhaps giving some indication of what he thought of the bird. By convention, the first name stands, so today the scientific name is Pachycephalia inornata. But while technically speaking, the name Gilbert's whistler refers just to the western race of the bird, the name is used universally today for the species. Gould also honoured Gilbert when naming two animals that Gilbert had collected for him from the dense heath in the south-west of Western Australia, Gilbert's dunnart and Gilbert's potoroo. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 new species from Western Australia, and 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844, he was back in Sydney, and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland. The Coxen family who settled the Darling Downs region were related by marriage; Gould's wife Elizabeth (n√©e Coxen) was sister to Charles and Stephen, and aunt to Henry William Coxen. The families allowed Gould and Gilbert to stay on their properties to collect fauna and flora of the district. Leichhardt's expedition The first expedition of Leichhardt While Gilbert was considering which part of the continent should next be investigated, Ludwig Leichhardt arrived with the other members of his expedition to Port Essington (east of Darwin, and since abandoned), and Gilbert was allowed to join the party in September 1844. In November, they decided the party was too large for the amount of provisions they had with them, and Leichhardt ruled that the two who had joined last should return. Eventually, however, it was decided that Hodgson and Caleb should return, and Gilbert remained to become later on practically the second in command of the expedition. One member of the party, a boy of 16, was too young to be of much use and the leader's treatment of the two aboriginal members of the party was lacking in tact and consideration. A good deal of responsibility therefore fell upon Gilbert, who was the best bushman of a very mixed company. The progress made for several months was much less than was anticipated, and by May 1845, supplies of food were running very short. Death Memorial to John Gilbert, Gilbert's Lookout, Taroom, 2014 Plaque on memorial to John Gilbert, Gilbert's Lookout, Taroom, 2014 Plaque about John Gilbert, Gilbert's Lookout, Taroom, 2014 On 28 June 1845 at the Mitchell River near Dunbar, Queensland on the Cape York Peninsula near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed by a flying spear when natives made a night attack on the expedition's camp, because some of their women had been molested by the two aboriginals with the Leichhardt party. There still exists some controversy over his death ‚Äì the wound was apparently smaller than a spear, and some suggest he died from accidental shooting by one of his companions. He was buried on the spot, a tree nearby was marked, and a fire was lit over the disturbed earth to screen the grave; this, although much searched for, has not since been found. Aftermath Other members of the expedition received several spear thrusts, but recovered. Leichhardt then turned south-westerly, skirting the gulf for a while, and reached Port Essington almost exhausted in December 1845. Leichhardt preserved Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Almost everything known about Gilbert is owed to Chisholm's research, which shows Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who had a great respect for the aboriginal peoples. Legacy There is a memorial to John Gilbert in St James' Church, Sydney. John Gilbert's memorial at St James' church is inscribed with the Latin phrase Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori, which may be translated as \\"it is sweet and fitting to die for science.\\" There is also a memorial to Gilbert at Gilbert's Lookout at Taroom. Various geographic features have been named after him, including: * Gilbert River, flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria ** Gilberton, on the Gilbert River headwaters ** Gilbert River Telegraph Station, between Croydon and Georgetown * Gilbert Range, near the Dawson Valley * Gilbert's Dome, in the Peak Range in Central Queensland Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii ), a species of mammal, was named after him; as was Gilbert's dragon (Lophognathus gilberti ), a species of lizard.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Gilbert, J.\\", p. 101). On 28 June 1945, to mark the centenary of Gilbert's death, wreaths of Australian wildflowers were placed on the marble memorial tablet in St James' Church in Sydney by representatives of: * the Royal Australian Historical Society of Sydney * the Royal Ornithologists' Union of Sydney * the Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria * the Melbourne Bird Observers' Club In the 1980s, the Australian Army searched for Gilbert's grave and have marked what they believe to be the probable location.

Marvel Comics. Thunderstrike is born Eric's role as Thor was relatively brief, as the Enchantress manipulated Eric into attacking Thor for Sif's affection. During a confrontation with Thor, Eric struck Sif. This provoked Thor, leading him to defeat Eric and reclaim Mjolnir while Odin revealed the Enchantress's manipulations.Thor #458 Odin then ordered the creation of a new mace for Eric, called Thunderstrike.Thor #459. Marvel Comics. Eric first used the Thunderstrike mace against the villains Bloodaxe and Carjack, but he was promptly defeated. Afterwards, Eric created his own costume to distinguish himself from Thor, while keeping Thor's reputation intact. Eric renamed himself Thunderstrike, after the mace itself, operating as an adventurer and crimefighter.Thunderstrike #1. Marvel Comics. Eventually Eric defeated Bloodaxe, only to discover that Bloodaxe was actually Jackie Lukus, his current love interest.Thunderstrike #22. Marvel Comics. Final conflicts and death After a confrontation with Seth the Egyptian god of death, Eric realized that the only way to defeat him was to succumb to the curse contained with the Bloodaxe and increase his strength.Thunderstrike #22-23.

Eric pleaded with Thor to kill him to prevent the curse of the Bloodaxe from taking him over completely. But Eric was eventually forced to fight the Bloodaxe subconsciously, which manifested in Eric's mind in the form of Skurge. Eric eventually defeated the Skurge duplicate, causing a psychic backlash that killed him and destroyed the two weapons.

Successor Eric's Thunderstrike mace (revealed to have been repaired by Thor and left in custody of the Avengers) was eventually given by Commander Steve Rogers to Kevin Masterson, who went on to become the new Thunderstrike and succeed his own father in the use of that identity.Thunderstrike Vol 2 #1. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Eric's abilities are derived from the enchanted mace Thunderstrike, made of mystic uru metal, which is nearly indestructible, crafted by the Asgardian dwarves Brokk and Eitri, and given the following enchantments by Odin: * Stamping the mace reverts Thunderstrike back to Eric's mortal human form, dressed in whichever clothes he last wore in that form, with any physical damage fully healed--with the exception of certain mystical spells such as Seth's Mark of Death, while the mace Thunderstrike transforms into a wooden cane. By stamping his walking stick on the ground Eric Masterson transforms back into his superhuman form, bearded, mustachioed, and dressed in the garb of Thunderstrike, while the cane again becomes the mace. * The mace itself can be thrown over great distances and return to the point it is thrown from. By throwing the mace and gripping the strap, Thunderstrike can fly. (However, the comic emphasizes that Thunderstrike's is much rockier and less steady than Thor's flight.) He can use the mace to fire powerful concussive blasts of mystical energy. The mace magically enables him to survive the adverse conditions of outer space, including its lack of oxygen. The mace can also be used for tracking various energy sources and has the ability to create mystical vortices to travel from one place to another. * Thunderstrike's physical abilities are enhanced to superhuman levels, including his strength, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, and endurance. As Thunderstrike, Masterson's appearance is identical to that of Thor, hence his superhuman form possesses Asgardian physiology. While his superhuman abilities were significantly above those of most Asgardians, his strength, stamina and durability were only a fraction of Thor's. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and has received some combat training from Captain America and Hercules. As Masterson, he is a highly skilled architect, with a master's degree in architecture. He is near-sighted, and wears eye-glasses.

Basavaraj,(2007) The Publications Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt of India, http://www.publicationsdivision.nic.in/b_show.asp?id=857 was a Haridasa, a renowned composer of Carnatic music, poet, philosopher and musician. He is knownMedieval Indian Literature, A Anthology (1997) by Shiva Prakash H.S., edited by Ayyappapanicker, Sahitya Akademi , pages 198‚Äì200 for his keertanas and ugabhoga, compositions in the Kannada language for Carnatic music. Like other Haridasas, he used simple Kannada language and native metrical forms for his compositions. Life Originally named Thimmappa Nayaka, Dasa belonged to a shepherd Kuruba caste of Kaginele in Haveri district. He was born in Baada village, near Bankapura and he was a warrior at Bankapura fort. Based on one of his compositions, it is interpreted that he was seriously injured in a battle and was miraculously saved. After this incident, he gave up his profession as a warrior and devoted himself to composing music, writing literature and explaining philosophy to the common man. His early work includes poems titled Narasimha stotra, Ramadhyana Mantra, and Mohanatarangini.  Nanu Hodare Hodenu  There is folklore behind this popular quotation. Kanakadaasa's Master Vyaasatirtha (‡≤µ‡≥ç‡≤Ø‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≤§‡≥Ä‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤•) once posed a question: Who among the scholars present in the convention could attain salvation (Moksha). Kanakadaasa firmly answered in the negative about himself as well as his master. Scholars in the convention were seriously agitated by his firm replies; they felt that Kanakadaasa must be haughtily inconsiderate to deny salvation to his own master let alone the remaining scholars. When asked about his own chances, he affirms: ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤®‡≥Å ‡≤π‡≥ã‡≤¶‡≤∞‡≥Ü ‡≤π‡≥ã‡≤¶‡≥á‡≤®‡≥Å (If \\"I\\" gone, I may go) adding to the fury of the scholars. His master who could discern the real wisdom behind Kanakadaasa's affirmation asked him to elaborate. He made a Pun giving different literal and philosophical meanings. Though it seemed on the surface that Kanakadaasa claimed that he alone may attain salvation, he had in fact put forth a thoughtful message, that no matter the level of one's scholarly prowess, one cannot achieve anything until the ego is eliminated. In Udupi Kanakadasa has a special association with Udupi as he was the disciple of Vyasatirtha Swamiji. On the request of Vyasaraya Swamiji of Vyasaraja Matt he had come to Udupi. But it was an era when discrimination on the basis of caste was at its peak. The priests would not let him enter the temple as he was from a \\"lower\\" caste though Vyaasaraaya Swamiji asked them to let Kanakadaasa into the temple. Kanakadaasa was outside the temple meditating on Krishna, his Lord, and singing songs in praise of Sri Krishna. He did this for weeks, camping outside the temple, cooking his own food. Though distraught over being prevented from entering the temple, he composed poems in praise of Lord Krishna and composed Kirthanas (Poems) which are relevant even today. He sings about how all humans being equal, as everyone is born the same way physically, everyone shares the same water and sees the same sun helping life on earth. Hindu temples and the deity in the temples always face east. In Udupi, though, Lord Krishna, in deity form, faces west. It is believed that something unnatural must have happened when Kanakadasa was outside the temple for days waiting to be allowed to go into the temple and see the. It is believed that during those days, when Kanakadaasa was not allowed to have darshan of Lord Krishna, he poured his heart out singing kirthanas for his dear Lord. Miraculously, the deity of Lord Krishna turned around to face west. Through a crack in the outer walls of the temple, Kanakadaasa the ardent devotee of Sri Krishna was able to see his Lord. This left the orthodox community flabbergasted why something like that had happened. Ever since, Sri Krishna's deity has been facing west, though the main entrance is east-facing. The miracle remains. Today that window (commonly called \\"Kanakana Kindi\\") stands as a tribute to Kanakadaasa. Devotees who visit Udupi's Sri Krishna temple, try to have a darshan of Lord Krishna through this small window seeking to re-live the ecstasy where Kanakadaasa had when granting the divine ‚Äòdarshan‚Äô. It is a memorial to Kanakadaas, and also testimony to the eclectic Hindu belief that devotion, poetry, and sainthood are above caste and creed and certainly above rigidly maintained orthodoxy.http://www.kanakaudupi.com/ It is said that Kanakadasa lived in a hut in this place in front of the ‚Äúgopura‚Äù. Later, a small shrine was built in his memory and it came to be known as ‚ÄúKanakana Kindi‚Äù or ‚ÄúKanakana Mandira‚Äù. Although many saints such as Purandaradaasa and Vijayadaasa visited Udupi and were devotees of Lord Krishna, it is Kanakadaasa's association with Lord Krishna, that conveys a deeper meaning.http://www.sumadhwaseva.com/dasaru/kanaka-dasaru/  Writings  thumb His writing started showing his innovativeness in using the day-to- day activities of the common man. For e.g. Ramadhanya Charite is a poetic expression of conflicts between rich and poor classes where he uses Ramadhanya ragi (staple food of poor and high in nutrients) and rice (main food of rich but not as rich in nutrients) to synonymously represent poor and rich. He joined Haridasa movement and became a follower of Vyasaraja who named him as Kanakadasa. His poems and krithi deal with many aspects of life and expose the futility of external rituals. They stress the need for the cultivation of moral values in life. His compositions addressed social issues in addition to the devotional aspect. Kanaka Dasa was very aggressive and straight forward in criticizing evils of society such as superiority claims using caste system. His poem \\"Kula Kula Kulavendu hodedhadadiri\\" asks humans not to segregate themselves from one another, because every human is born the same way, everyone eats the same food and drinks the same water, hence none is superior or inferior to one another. The deity he worshiped was Adhikeshava of Kaginele, presently in Haveri district of Karnataka. Kaginele, now a village, was a prosperous place and trading center in the Middle Ages. Out of the many of his compositions, about 240 (see Ref 2) are fully accountable today. All his Karnataka Music compositions end with mudra (signature) Kaginele Adhikeshava. In addition to being a poet, he worked as a social reformer by downplaying dogmatic communities that were suppressing the disadvantaged communities. Kanakadasa made an extreme effort in reforming the disadvantaged communities by convincing them to give up their age-old obsolete social practices and adapt to the changing world. He effectively used music to convey his philosophy. He lived at Tirupathi in his last days. He is one of the greatest musicians, composers, poets, social reformers, philosophers and saints that India has ever seen.'''''' Major works #Nalacharithre (‡≤®‡≤≥‡≤ö‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ü) #Haribhakthisara (‡≤π‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤≠‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤ø‡≤∏‡≤æ‡≤∞) #Nrisimhastava (‡≤®‡≥É‡≤∏‡≤ø‡≤Ç‡≤π‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤µ) #Ramadhanyacharithre (‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Æ‡≤ß‡≤æ‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤Ø‡≤ö‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤§‡≥Ü), a rare work on class struggle #Mohanatarangini (‡≤Æ‡≥ã‡≤π‡≤®‡≤§‡≤∞‡≤Ç‡≤ó‡≤ø‡≤£‡≤ø) Kanakadasa wrote about two hundred forty Karnataka Music compositions (Kirtane, Ugabhogas, padas, and mundiges or philosophical songs)Kanakadasa-The Golden servant of Lord Hari (2001) by Basavaraj Naikar, National Book Trust besides five major works. His compositions are published in many languages. For example, about 100 songs in KannadaKanaka Daasara Padagalu (1997) By S Rudramurthy Shastri, Bhagya Laksmi Publishers, Bangalore and 60 songs in EnglishSongs of Three Great South Indian Saints by William J. Jackson (2002), Oxford India Paper, ' are published in popular books. His writings were unique in style. In Ramadhanyacharitre, an allegory on the conflict between the socially strong and weak castes and classes, presented as an argument between two foodgrains, rice and ragi, is a most creative literary piece with a powerful social message, In the work, rice represents the socially powerful and ragi (millet) represents the working people. The two grains come before Rama to argue their case and establish their superiority. In the end, Rama sends both of them to prison for six months. At the end of the period, rice has turned rotten while the hardy ragi survive, earning Rama's blessings. This shows the intelligence of Kanakadasa in trying to reform society. He was blunt in criticizing those who opposed the good practices. In one of his compositions, he says,\\"Eternal hell is for those who criticize noblemen, for those who condemn teachings of jagadguru...\\". *Nalacharitre (Story of Nala) *Haribhaktisara (crux of Krishna devotion) *Nrisimhastava (compositions in praise of Lord Narasimha) *Ramadhanyacharite (story of ragi millet) and an epic *Mohanatarangini (Krishna-river). Kanakadasa rationalized bhakti (devotion) by giving worldly similes. His writing has an intimate touch that identifies the reader with the poet himself. His two famous compositions in the translation are given below. One condemns the caste system in a refined poetic way and the other wonders at the colorful and baffling creation of God Almighty in childlike wonder. His Nalacharite is based on the famous love-story of Nala and Damayanti, which appears in Mahabharata. Though a great devotee of Lord Krishna, Kanakadasa gives his own interpretation. Nala who is in love with Damayanti exercises restraint in the svayamvara (choosing bride/bridegroom) ceremony to win over Damayanti by allowing Indra and other gods a chance to win over her. When he loses everything in a dice-game and gets exiled to the forest, stubbornly followed by Damayanti, he deserts her in sleep, hoping that she may go back to her parents and have a better life. He later drives king Rituparna to the second svayamvara of Damayanti, to see his wife married to a suitable person and be happy! Lord Krishna appears only once casually to rescue the caravan in which the hapless Damayanti was traveling and was attacked by wild elephants. Nrisimhastava is a work dealing with the glory of god Narasimha (half human and half lion). Kanakadasa's Ramadhanyacharite has quite an unconventional theme. It is about a battle of words between ragi (millet) and rice, each claiming superiority. They go to lord Rama for justice. With the help of the sages, Rama proves the superiority of ragi over rice. Ragi becomes blessed by absorbing the qualities of Raghava, another epithet of Rama. It is interpreted as poverty and humility being upheld by the poet above material wealth. Even today, Ragi is the food of the poor, having high nutritional value compared to rice, especially for people with diabetes because of its low sugar content. Mohanatarangini, although a kavya (a poem in classical style) written with all conventional eighteen descriptions, deals with eroticism. Pleasure-based eroticism of Shri Krishna with the consorts. The eroticism between Aniruddha and Usha forms the main theme. It excels in depicting contemporary life. The description of Shri Krishna's Dwaravati (Dwaraka) is very similar to that of Vijayanagara, under Krishnadevaraya as noticed by foreign travelers. The market place with colorful stalls with various commodities, well-demarcated lanes brimming with craftsmen, clients and merchants, royal garden parties and glory of the palace find their place in Mohanatarangini. It echoes the contemporary Portuguese travelers' accounts. A drinking bout of men and women of the working-class is very picturesque. The reader feels as if Kanakadasa is providing a commentary of a live event. It is for such unconventional and down-to-earth descriptions as also for social awareness that the great poet- saint has become immortal. Kanakadasa Jayanthi In tribute to the great saint, the Government of Karnataka has declared his birthday as a state holiday. All the government offices, schools, and colleges around the state celebrate the birth anniversary of Shri Kanaka Dasa. Legendary Kannada actor and singer from the Kannada movie industry Dr. Rajkumar enacted as KankaDasa in the movie Bhakta Kanakadasa and the movie received good response from the public. Film director and playwright Girish Karnad made a documentary film titled, Kanaka-Purandara (English, 1988) on the two medieval Bhakti poets of Karnataka.Kanaka-Purandara IMDbAWARDS: The multi-faceted playwright Frontline (magazine), Vol. 16, No. 03, January 30 - February 12, 1999. Unfortunately, the State holiday in Karnataka is not used for unifying the castes and creating the much needed social harmony that Shree Kanaka Dasa struggled all his life. Kanakadasa Jayanthi is celebrated across all the communities, which is good progress. In January 2013, the Kaginele Development Authority ‚Äì Kaginele, Haveri District, Government of Karnataka, India - re-dedicated the newly built Kanaka Dasa Fort and Palace to the general public, at Baada, Bankapur. The tourist spot is open for the general public and highlights the life and sainthood of Kanaka Dasa The Kannada movie Lucia starts with Nee Mayeyolago recited and is based on an abstract idea of the same theme. Another Kannada movie Ramadhanya [May 2018] based on his life and most famous work - Ramadhanya charithre - beautifully encapsulates the saint's karmic journey and the relationship between two staple food of South Indians (1) Raghava Dhanya or Ragi and (2) Bhattha or Rice...

Ouyang is the most common two-character Chinese compound surname, being the only two-character name of the 400-most common Chinese surnames, according to 2013 study, and is one of the twenty-odd two-character surnames that have survived into modern times. History The Song Dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu traced the Ouyang surname to Ti (, Pinyin: T√≠), a prince of Yue, the second son of King Wujiang (). After his state was extinguished by the state of Chu, Ti and his family was living in the south side of the Mount Ouyu (, currently called Mount Sheng in Huzhou, Zhejiang). In Classical Chinese, the south side of a mountain or the north bank of a river is called Yang (), thus the Ti family was called Ouyang. He was called Marquis of Ouyang Village (). Traditionally, Ti's ancestry can be traced through his father Wujiang, the King of Yue, to the semi-legendary Yu the Great (). According to a 2013 study, Ouyang was the 169th most common name in China, being shared by around 910000 people or 0.068% of the total population, with the province with the most people with the name being Hunan. Geographical origins In terms of distribution Ouyangs have mostly been confined to southern China, especially the areas of southern Jiangxi, central Hubei and eastern Henan, with smaller pockets in Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan and Guangxi. Notable clans The most prominent of the Ouyang clans historically was undoubtedly that of Yongfeng in Jiangxi, which produced a number of scholars who reached prominence in the imperial bureaucracy. Genealogical lineages and family trees have been established for a number of Ouyang clans around China, showing migration patterns from the Song to the Qing dynasty. Immigration outside of China There was a large immigration of Ouyangs in the late 19th century and early 20th century to the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento Delta Area. In summer of 2005, the first extended Ouyang family reunion was held in Locke, near Sacramento. Over 200 Ouyangs attended and included speeches, sharing, family trees and documentation. This group continues to communicate using Ouyang Yahoo! Groups and spans members from across North America and beyond.

Post towns in general originated as the location of delivery offices. , their main function is to distinguish between localities or street names in addresses not including a postcode. Organisation There are approximately 1,500 post towns which are organised by Royal Mail subject to its policy only to impose changes where it has a proven, economic and practical benefit to the organisation, covering its own cost. Each post town usually corresponds to one or more postal districts (the 'outward' part of the postcode, before the space) therefore each post town can cover an area comprising many towns, urban districts and villages. Post towns rarely correspond exactly to administrative boundaries and their associated physical features. As such they often group a small minority of neighbourhoods, streets or houses together with a main settlement in a different county, area of local government or administration (including healthcare trust), constituency, European statistical region and/or traditional parish. This was a main reason why postal counties were abolished (but not prohibited) in 1996. In some places several post towns cover a single postal district (with each post town corresponding to one or more of its postcode sectors). There are anomalies where post towns and postcode sectors have a more unusual co-relation. For example, the postcode sector EH14 5 is split between three post towns: Juniper Green, Currie and Balerno. Its other postcode sectors are generally one of these, Balerno. Usage Royal Mail states that the post town must be included on all items and should be clearly written in capitals. :1 Vallance Road :LONDON :E2 1AA The use of postcodes means that it is no longer necessary to include the former postal county in a postal address. Some post towns, known as special post towns, never required the inclusion of a postal county, either because the town was large or because it gave its name to the county. Locality In most places, additional locality information such as a village or suburb name is optionally added above the post town, giving a more specific location: the two largest 'post town' cities named, for example, have many roads of the same name in different localities and the additional locality information is therefore essential if the postcode is wrongly recorded or unknown. Where this is a disambiguating feature, Royal Mail terms this the \\"dependent locality\\". For a limited number of addresses a \\"double dependent locality\\" line is also required, preceding the dependent locality line. Locality information other than the post town is not always part of the official postal address. In particular, within the London post town, each postcode district name (which can conflict with administrative boundaries, see above) corresponds to a numbered postcode district and is therefore not required in the postal address whenever the postcode is used. For example, \\"Bethnal Green\\" is the name of the \\"E2\\" postcode district and is optional in the following address: :1 Vallance Road :Bethnal Green :LONDON :E2 1AA If no valid postcode is provided, or if the sorting machine rejects the letter, the use of optional locality or county information may assist manual sorting. In the absence of a full valid postcode, locality often prevents ambiguity where there is more than one street with the same name covered by a post town or postcode district, or where post towns in different counties have the same name. Via Traditionally only, where a place such as a village was served by a post town entirely distinct from its location, the word \\"Via\\" or \\"Near\\" (\\"Nr.\\") was added before the post town. For example: :1 High Street :Sewardstone :Via London :E4 1AA However, the Royal Mail discourages this usage because their optical character recognition technology and Mailsort lookup tables check for the post town at the beginning of a line if the postcode is missing, unreadable or incorrect. Additionally, \\"Near\\" and \\"Nr.\\" can be confused with \\"North\\". Ambiguous post town names Post town names are unique within each former postal county and each postcode area (the initial letter or two letters of the post code). But across the UK, some post towns have identical or similar names. For Mailsort purposes, post towns in unpostcoded addresses can be pre-sorted only if the first 10 characters of the post town name correspond unambiguously to only one post town. In addition, the following post towns have shared sorting routes or cover such large locations that the town name is insufficient for determining the relevant delivery area without reference to the postcode or further locality information: * Barnsley (S) * Belfast (BT) * Birmingham (B) * Bolton (BL) * Cardiff (CF) * Chester (CH) * Chesterfield (S) * Glasgow (G) * Leeds (LS) * London (E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC) * Manchester (M) * Mansfield (NG) * Nottingham (NG) * Redditch (B) * Salford (M) * Sheffield (S) See also *Postcode Address File *Postcodes in the United Kingdom References Category:Postal addresses in the United Kingdom ","title":"Post town"},{"id":"1111060","title":"Repeater (album)"},{"id":"1111061","text":"Spjelkavik is a borough in the town of √Ölesund in √Ölesund Municipality, M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway.

He has written numerous poems and plays, and several film scripts, but is best known as a novelist. His first novel was published the year after Historien om Gly and titled Amat√∏ren (The Amateur). Among his most noted works are the novels Beatles (1984) (for which he won the Cappelen Prize) and Halvbroren (The Half Brother, 2001) (for which he won the Brage Prize, two other Norwegian literary awards, and The Nordic Council's Literature Prize, and which was shortlisted for the 2005 International Dublin Literary Award). Other notable books by Saabye Christensen are Herman, Gutten Som Ville V√¶re En Av Gutta, Maskeblomstfamilien and Modellen. Between 2017 and 2019, he released a trilogy titled Byens spor (The Traces of a City), in which all three books were met with critical acclaim, while simultaneously being treated for a spinal disc herniation and bone marrow cancer.VG.no 21.08.2019 Since 1993 he has issued 4 recordings of his poetry as a member of the band Norsk Utflukt: Med lyset p√• (1993), Diger og gul (1997), Det bl√• arret (2002) and Tida som g√•r (2004).

Twin satellites took detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field anomalies from its launch in March 2002 to the end of its science mission in October 2017. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) is a continuation of the mission on near-identical hardware, launched in May 2018. By measuring gravity anomalies, GRACE showed how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time. Data from the GRACE satellites is an important tool for studying Earth's ocean, geology, and climate. GRACE was a collaborative endeavor involving the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the German Aerospace Center and Germany's National Research Center for Geosciences, Potsdam. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was responsible for the overall mission management under the NASA ESSP (Earth System Science Pathfinder) program. The principal investigator is Byron Tapley of the University of Texas Center for Space Research, and the co-principal investigator is Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam. The two GRACE satellites (GRACE-1 and GRACE-2) were launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia, on a Rockot (SS-19 + Breeze upper stage) launch vehicle on 17 March 2002. The spacecraft were launched to an initial altitude of approximately 500 km at a near-polar inclination of 89¬∞. During normal operations, the satellites were separated by 220 km along their orbit track. This system was able to gather global coverage every 30 days. GRACE far exceeded its 5-year design lifespan, operating for 15 years until the decommissioning of GRACE-2 on 27 October 2017. Its successor, GRACE-FO, was successfully launched on 22 May 2018. In 2019, a glacier in West Antarctica was named after the GRACE mission.  Discoveries and applications  The monthly gravity anomalies maps generated by GRACE are up to 1,000 times more accurate than previous maps, substantially improving the accuracy of many techniques used by oceanographers, hydrologists, glaciologists, geologists and other scientists to study phenomena that influence climate. From the thinning of ice sheets to the flow of water through aquifers and the slow currents of magma inside Earth, mass measurements provided by GRACE help scientists better understand these important natural processes.  Oceanography, hydrology, and ice sheets  GRACE chiefly detected changes in the distribution of water across the planet. Scientists use GRACE data to estimate ocean bottom pressure (the combined weight of the ocean waters and atmosphere), which is as important to oceanographers as atmospheric pressure is to meteorologists. For example, measuring ocean pressure gradients allows scientists to estimate monthly changes in deep ocean currents. The limited resolution of GRACE is acceptable in this research because large ocean currents can also be estimated and verified by an ocean buoy network. Scientists have also detailed improved methods for using GRACE data to describe Earth's gravity field. GRACE data are critical in helping to determine the cause of sea level rise, whether it is the result of mass being added to the ocean - from melting glaciers, for example - or from thermal expansion of warming water or changes in salinity. High-resolution static gravity fields estimated from GRACE data have helped improve the understanding of global ocean circulation. The hills and valleys in the ocean's surface (ocean surface topography) are due to currents and variations in Earth's gravity field. GRACE enables separation of those two effects to better measure ocean currents and their effect on climate. GRACE data have provided a record of mass loss within the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland has been found to lose of ice per year between 2003 and 2013, while Antarctica has lost per year in the same period. These equate to a total of 0.9 mm/yr of sea level rise. GRACE data have also provided insights into regional hydrology inaccessible to other forms of remote sensing: for example, groundwater depletion in India and California. The annual hydrology of the Amazon basin provides an especially strong signal when viewed by GRACE. A University of California, Irvine-led study published in Water Resources Research on 16 June 2015 used GRACE data between 2003 and 2013 to conclude that 21 of the world's 37 largest aquifers \\"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\\" and thirteen of them are \\"considered significantly distressed.\\" The most over-stressed is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.  Geophysics  GRACE uses precise measurements of the motions of two spacecraft in Earth's orbit to track the movement of water through the oceans, land, and atmosphere. Change in mass of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as measured by GRACE GRACE also detects changes in the gravity field due to geophysical processes. Glacial isostatic adjustment‚Äîthe slow rise of land masses once depressed by the weight of ice sheets from the last ice age‚Äîis chief among these signals. GIA signals appear as secular trends in gravity field measurements and must be removed to accurately estimate changes in water and ice mass in a region. GRACE is also sensitive to permanent changes in the gravity field due to earthquakes. For instance, GRACE data have been used to analyze the shifts in the Earth's crust caused by the earthquake that created the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2006, a team of researchers led by Ralph von Frese and Laramie Potts used GRACE data to discover the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica, which were probably formed about 250 million years ago.  Geodesy  Data from GRACE has improved the current Earth gravitational field model, leading to improvements in the field of geodesy. This improved model has allowed for corrections in the equipotential surface which land elevations are referenced from. This more accurate reference surface allows for more accurate coordinates of latitude and longitude and for less error in the calculation of geodetic satellite orbits.  Other signals  GRACE is sensitive to regional variations in the mass of the atmosphere and high- frequency variation in ocean bottom pressure. These variations are well understood and are removed from monthly gravity estimates using forecast models to prevent aliasing. Nonetheless, errors in these models do influence GRACE solutions. GRACE data also contribute to fundamental physics. They have been used to re-analyze data obtained from the LAGEOS experiment to try to measure the relativistic frame-dragging effect.  Spacecraft  Diagrams illustrating the systems and instruments aboard the GRACE spacecraft The spacecraft were manufactured by Astrium of Germany, using its \\"Flexbus\\" platform. The microwave RF systems, and attitude determination and control system algorithms were provided by Space Systems/Loral. The star cameras used to measure the spacecraft attitude were provided by Technical University of Denmark. The instrument computer along with a highly precise BlackJack GPS receiver and digital signal processing system was provided by JPL in Pasadena. The highly precise accelerometer that is needed to separate atmospheric and solar radiation pressure effects from the gravitation data was manufactured by ONERA.  Measurement principle  GRACE is the first Earth-monitoring mission in the history of space flight whose key measurement is not derived from electromagnetic waves either reflected off, emitted by, or transmitted through Earth's surface and/or atmosphere. Instead, the mission uses a microwave ranging system to accurately measure changes in the speed and distance between two identical spacecraft flying in a polar orbit about apart, above Earth. The ranging system is sensitive enough to detect separation changes as small as 10 micrometers (approximately one-tenth the width of a human hair) over a distance of 220 kilometers. As the twin GRACE satellites circle the globe 15 times a day, they sense minute variations in Earth's gravitational pull. When the first satellite passes over a region of slightly stronger gravity, a gravity anomaly, it is pulled slightly ahead of the trailing satellite. This causes the distance between the satellites to increase. The first spacecraft then passes the anomaly, and slows down again; meanwhile the following spacecraft accelerates, then decelerates over the same point. By measuring the constantly changing distance between the two satellites and combining that data with precise positioning measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments, scientists can construct a detailed map of Earth's gravity anomalies.  Instruments  The two satellites (nicknamed \\"Tom\\" and \\"Jerry\\") constantly maintain a two-way, K-band microwave-ranging link between them. Fine distance measurements are made by comparing frequency shifts of the link. This is made possible due to the onboard Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO) which produces the frequencies for the K-band ranging system. The micrometer-sensitivity of this measurement requires accordingly precise measurements of each spacecraft's position, motion, and orientation to be useful. To remove the effect of external, non-gravitational forces (e.g., drag, solar radiation pressure), the vehicles use sensitive Super STAR electrostatic accelerometers located near their respective centers of mass. GPS receivers are used to establish the precise positions of each satellite along the baseline between the satellites. The satellites use star cameras and magnetometers to establish attitude. The GRACE vehicles also have optical corner reflectors to enable laser ranging from ground stations using the Center of Mass Trim Assembly (MTA) which ensures the center of mass is modified throughout the flight accordingly.  Data products  CSR, GFZ, and JPL process observations and ancillary data downloaded from GRACE to produce monthly geopotential models of Earth. These models are distributed as spherical harmonic coefficients with a maximum degree of 60. Degree 90 products are also available. These products have a typical latency of 1‚Äì2 months. These geopotential coefficients may be used to compute geoid height, gravity anomalies, and changes in the distribution of mass on Earth's surface. Gridded products estimating changes in mass in units of liquid water equivalent thickness are available at JPL's GRACE Tellus website.  End of mission  Following an age-related battery issue on GRACE-2 in September 2017, it became apparent that GRACE-2's remaining battery capacity would not be sufficient to operate. Therefore, it was decided in mid-October to decommission the GRACE-2 satellite and end GRACE's science mission. Atmospheric reentry of GRACE-2 occurred on 24 December 2017 at approximately 00:16 UTC; atmospheric reentry of GRACE-1 took place on 10 March 2018 around 06:09 UTC.  GRACE Follow-On  The GRACE-FO mission, a collaboration between NASA and GFZ, was launched on 22 May 2018 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg AFB, California, sharing the launch with five Iridium NEXT satellites. During in-orbit checks, an anomaly was discovered in the primary system component of the microwave instrument (MWI), and the system was temporarily powered down on 19 July 2018. After a full investigation by an anomaly response team at JPL, the backup system in the MWI was powered up on 19 October 2018 and GRACE-FO resumed its in-orbit checks. GRACE-FO entered the science phase of its mission on 28 January 2019. The orbit and design of GRACE-FO is very similar to its predecessor. GRACE-FO employs the same two-way microwave-ranging link as GRACE, which will allow for similar inter-satellite ranging precision. In addition, GRACE-FO employs laser-ranging interferometry (LRI) as a technological experiment in preparation for future satellites. The LRI allows for more accurate inter-satellite ranging due to the shorter wavelength of light, and additionally allows the angle between the two spacecraft to be measured as well as their separation via differential wavefront sensing (DWS). Using the LRI, scientists have improved the precision of the separation distance measurements by a factor of more than 20 relative to the GRACE mission. Each laser on the LRI has about the same power as four laser pointers. These lasers must be detected by a spacecraft about 137 miles (220 kilometers) away. This laser approach will generate much more accurate measurements than the previous GRACE satellite mission. The GRACE-FO satellites obtain electricity from gallium arsenide solar cell array panels covering the outside of each satellite. GRACE-FO will continue to monitor Earth's gravity and climate. The mission will track gravitational changes in global sea levels, glaciers, and ice sheets, as well as large lake and river water levels, and soil moisture. In addition, each of the satellites will use GPS antennas to create at least 200 profiles per day of atmospheric temperature distribution and water vapor content, a first for the GRACE mission. GRACE-FO has a design life of 5 years.

It was a development of the British H2S radar, the first ground mapping radar to be used in combat. It was also known as the \\"Mickey set\\" and \\"BTO\\" for \\"bombing through the overcast\\" radar. H2X differed from the original H2S primarily in its X band 10 GHz operating frequency rather than H2S' S band 3 GHz emissions. This gave H2X higher resolution than H2S, allowing it to provide usable images over large cities which appeared as a single blob on the H2S display. The Royal Air Force (RAF) initially considered using H2X as well, but would instead develop their own X band system, the H2S Mk. III. The RAF system entered service in late 1943, before the first use of H2X in early 1944. The desire for even higher resolution, enough to image individual docks and bridges, led to a number of variations on the H2X system, as well as the more advanced AN/APQ-7 \\"Eagle\\" system. All of these were replaced in the post-war era with systems customized for the jet powered strategic bombers that entered service. Usage French- language diagram of H2X displays and equipment H2X was used by the USAAF during World War II as a navigation system for daylight overcast and nighttime operations. It was introduced as an improvement of the earlier H2S set, which had been supplied to the US to aid in the war effort. While the RAF Bomber Command utilized ground mapping radar as an aid to night area bombing, the primary use by the USAAF was as a fallback, to allow cities to be bombed even when hidden by cloud cover, an issue that had dogged their policy of precision daylight bombing since the start of the war, especially in cloud-prone Europe. With H2X, a city could be located and a general area targeted, night or day, cloud cover or no, with equal accuracy. H2X used a shorter 3 cm \\"centimetric\\" wavelength (10 GHz frequency) than the H2S, giving a higher angular resolution and thus a sharper picture, which allowed much finer details to be discerned, aiding in target identification. H2S subsequently also adopted 3 cm in the Mark III version entering operational service on November 18, 1943, for ‚ÄúBattle of Berlin‚Äù). H2X is not known to have ever been spotted by the German FuG 350 Naxos radar detector, due to that receiving device's specific purpose being to spot the original British H2S equipment's lower frequency, 3 GHz emissions. Pathfinder missions The H2X's resolution was enough to produce good images of other aircraft, in this case, another B-17 Flying Fortress flying below the radar-carrying aircraft. The first H2X-equipped B-17's arrived in England in early October 1943, and were first used in combat on 3 November 1943 when the USAAF VIII Bomber Command attacked the port of Wilhelmshaven. Those missions where bombing was done by H2X were called \\"Pathfinder missions\\" and the crews were called \\"Pathfinder crews\\", after RAF practice of using highly trained Pathfinder crews to go in before the main bomber stream and identify and mark the target with flares. American practice used their Pathfinder crews as lead bombers, with radar equipped aircraft being followed by formations of radar-less bombers, which would all drop their loads when the lead bomber did. The ventral hemispherical radome for the H2X's rotating dish antenna replaced the ball turret on B-17 Flying Fortress Pathfinders, with the electronics cabinets for the \\"Mickey set\\" being installed in the radio room just aft of the bomb bay. The H2X on later B-24 Liberators also replaced the ball turret, being made retractable as the ball turret was for landing on the Liberator. The operators panel was installed on the flight deck behind the co-pilot (where the radio operator's normal position was). In combat areas the Mickey operator directed the pilot on headings to be taken, and on the bomb run directed the airplane in coordination with the bombardier. The first use of Mickey was against Ploie»ôti on April 5, 1944. Radar mapping of Germany Due to the absence of radar maps, in late April 1944 six PR Mk.XVI de Havilland Mosquito aircraft in the 482nd Bomb Group were equipped with H2X equipment. The idea was to produce photographs of the radar screen during flights over Germany allowing easy interpretation of these radar images in later bombing runs. Three aircraft were subsequently lost in training, and the project was discontinued. A further twelve PR Mk.XVI Mosquitos of the 25th Bomb Group (Reconnaissance) of the Eighth Air Force were fitted with H2X and beginning in May 1944 flew radar mapping night missions until February 1945. The sets tended to overload the Mosquito's electrical system and occasionally exploded. Mickey-equipped Mosquitos had the highest loss, abort, and mission failure rates of any version of the otherwise successful Mosquito reconnaissance aircraft, and were severely curtailed after February 19, 1945. Three were lost to enemy action and one was shot down by friendly fire from a Ninth Air Force P-47. In Europe several P-38 fighters were also converted to carrying H2X radar in the nose, along with an operator/navigator in a cramped compartment in the nose behind the radar dish, provided with small side windows and an access/exit hatch in the floor (much like the earlier P-38 \\"Droop Snoot\\" bomber-leader variants, but with a radome instead of a glazed nose). These missions were to obtain radar maps of German targets but plans to produce the variant in quantity never materialized. B-29 equipment In the Pacific theater, B-29‚Äôs were equipped with the improved H2X radar called the AN/APQ-13, a ground scanning radar developed by Bell, Western Electric, and MIT. The radome was carried on the aircraft belly between the bomb bays and was partially retractable. The radar operated at a frequency of 9,375 ¬± 45 megahertz and used a superheterodyne receiver. The radar was used for high altitude area bombing, search and navigation. Computation for bombing could be performed by an impact predictor. A range unit permitted a high degree of accuracy in locating beacons. Post war usage Post-war, the AN/APQ-13 became the first military radar converted to a domestic peacetime application as a storm warning radar. About thirty systems were converted and installed on military bases. It was replaced by the AN/CPS-9 system in 1949.

Beneath the volcano: religion, cosmology and spirit classification among the Nage of eastern Indonesia. Leiden, KITLV Press. . p. 104. In the Nage language of central Flores, ebu means \\"grandparent\\" and gogo means \\"one who eats anything\\". A colloquial English equivalent might be something like \\"old glutton.\\" Folklore record The Nage people of Flores describe the Ebu Gogo as having been able walkers and fast runners around 1.5 m tall. They reportedly had wide and flat noses, broad faces with large mouths and hairy bodies. The females also had \\"long, pendulous breasts\\". They were said to have murmured in what was assumed to be their own language and could reportedly repeat what was said to them in a parrot-like fashion. The legends relating to the Ebu Gogo were traditionally attributed to monkeys, according to the journal Nature. An article in New Scientist gives the following account of folklore on Flores surrounding the Ebu Gogo: in the 18th century, villagers gave the Ebu Gogo a gift of palm fiber to make clothes, and once the Ebu Gogo took the fiber into their cave, the villagers threw in a firebrand to set it alight, killing all of the occupants (one pair may have fled into the forest). There are also legends about the Ebu Gogo kidnapping human children, hoping to learn from them how to cook. The children always easily outwit the Ebu Gogo in the tales.  Proposed connection to Homo floresiensis  The Ebu Gogo folklore has gained public attention with the discovery of Homo floresiensis, an extinct hominid species that inhabited Flores until c. 50,000 years ago. The ethnologist Gregory Forth (2008) has suggested that tales about Ebu Gogo and similar figures in the folkore of Indonesia such as the Orang Pendek are based on the memory of actual encounters between modern humans and Homo floresiensis. This proposal has little mainstream support, especially after the dating of the extinction of Homo floresiensis which initially was assumed to have occurred at c. 12,000 BP was revised to 50,000 BP.

Belief in Taotao Mo'na is present throughout these islands.  Academic accounts With the Spanish conquest of Guam in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the resultant destruction of the old way of life of the native Chamorros, went also the practice of ancestor veneration. Early Spanish accounts of Chamorros did not include any mention of Taotao Mo'na. The concept of Taotao Mo'na therefore appears to have emerged during the Spanish occupation and was created by the Chamorros who \\"turned to the memory of their Before Time Ancestors for pride and comfort.\\" The modern stories of Taotao Mo'na tend to be simple superstitions in which Taotao Mo'na are mischievous or monstrous, rather than the complex myths of pre-Contact Chamorros, such as the creation story of the gods Puntan and Fu'una or the Three Feats of Strength by Chief Gadao.Robert Tenorio Torres, , Micronesian Journal of the Humanities and Sciences, University of Hawaii, December 2003, pp. 12-13. Behavior of Taotao Mo'na Despite the modernity of most Chamorros, there is still a healthy respect for Taotao Mo'na. It is thought that if they are offended, they can cause bad influences in a particular location or towards a particular person. Taotao Mo'na are believed to inhabit any secluded natural place on the island particularly in the south of the island. Locals and \\"traditional\\" Chamorros claim that one must request permission from the Taotao Mo'na before entering the jungle or taking fruit or wood from it. Another enduring superstition is their dislike of pregnant women. Pregnant Chamorro women are often told to use perfume to mask their scent or to wear their husband's clothing, and to stay indoors at night to keep taotaomo'na away. Some Taotao Mo'na are described as being headless and malicious if their land is not respected, while some are said to be gentler spirits who aid local witch doctors, called suruhanas or suruhanus. Taotao Mo'na have been known to pinch, bruise, imitate voices and kidnap children for short periods of time. People also claim taotaomon'a can become attached to certain people they like, making them ill - and only a visit to a suruhana can make the spirit go away. The Taotao Mo'na were investigated in a segment of the Syfy television show Destination Truth entitled \\"Guam Zombies,\\" where they were (incorrectly) said to appear as zombie-like; however, the Taotao Mo'na are not zombies, but ancestral spirits that are said to live within banyan trees. The trees themselves are said to have moving roots that change direction every night.

The organization is aimed to provide a unique educational environment for the exceptionally talented students. History The organization was founded in 1976 as the National Iranian Organization for Gifted and Talented Education (NIOGATE). The original faculty were trained by a visiting group of educators from the United States. After the revolution, the schools were shut down for a few years but were later re-opened. In 1988, the organization was renamed to National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents. From 1988 to 2009, Javad Ezhe'i was the manager of NODET, who was succeeded by Dr. Etemadi and Dr. Ghaffari and Mohajerani. Structure The schools, like other Iranian schools, are gendered. Girls' schools are generally called Farzanegan School, whereas boys' schools have different names in different cities. Some of the schools are:Allameh Helli in Tehran, Beheshti High Schools in Sari, Torbat Heydariyeh, Zahedan, Ardabil, Semnan, Shahrud, Sabzevar, Zanjan, Ahwaz, Kashan, Kerman, Kermanshah, Tonekabon, Sanandaj, Ilam, Shahrekord, Amol, Ghaemshahr, Urmia, Birjand, Bojnurd, Babol, Gorgan, Borujerd, Maragheh, Hamedan, Arak, Shahid Babaei Highschool in Qazvin, Madani, Ostad Shahriar(OSH) in Tabriz, Mianeh, Shahid Soltani School, Darolfonoun in Shahriar, Haghani in Bandar Abbass, Hashemi Nejad School in Mashhad, Sheikh Ansari High School in Dezful, Dastgheib High school in Shiraz, Shahid Ejei High School in Isfahan, Mirza Koochak Khan in Rasht, and Sadoughi in Yazd. Honours and alumni NODET students are reputed to be successful in various exams and competitions such as Konkour(Iranian National Universities Entrance Exam), scientific and literature olympiads, Khawrazmi International Award, and RoboCup Competitions. NODET students have won more than 250 medals in the International Science Olympiads. Among the alumni of NODET are many successful academics and individuals. One well-known example was Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani, a professor of mathematics at Stanford University, who was the first woman and the first Iranian honored with the Fields Medal (the most prestigious award in mathematics). A large fraction of the NODET graduates is admitted to foreign universities in the US, Canada, Australia and the EU. Admission to schools Admission to NODET schools was selective, and based on an annual comprehensive nationwide entrance examination procedure for students in grade 5 (elementary school) and grade 9 (middle school). A minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) was required for attending the entrance exam. The students who are admitted to NODET middle school or junior high school (Year 7-9) are automatically offered a seat in NODET high schools or senior high schools (Year 10-12) unless they under perform. There is however a nation while exam to fill in the seats in high schools at the end of Year 9. The entrance exam at each level includes a number of 4 choice and written questions which test the applicants intelligence and maths and science skills based on what they have studied in previous years. The sources of questions were not revealed. Statistically, less than 1% of applicants were chosen to enter the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools across the country. In 2006 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied. 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle schools. In 2019, over 174,000 candidates have applied for NODET schools in 7th grade (junior high school) and 17,223 were admitted. On the same year, over 132,000 candidates applied for seats in 10th grade (senior high schools) and only 11,867 were offered a place. The style of questions varied greatly each year. Some questions would describe a particular phenomenon and its related problems. Then, students were asked to provided solutions and reasoning. The evaluation of the answers wouldn't be based on the choice, but on the described reason, trying to distinguish students with higher reasoning abilities. In another atypical type of questions, students were introduced with a brief introduction on a certain complex scientific topic, which most students were not supposedly familiar with. Afterward, students were asked to solve a given problem using mathematical calculations, reasoning, or even their common sense. Statistics show that NODET alumni usually pursue higher education up to post-graduate level.

The resulting engagement is also known as the Battle of the East China Sea. In April 1945, the , the largest battleship in the world, and nine other Japanese warships, embarked from Japan for a suicide attack on Allied forces engaged in the battle of Okinawa. The Japanese force was attacked by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft before it could reach Okinawa. Yamato and five other Japanese warships were sunk. The battle demonstrated U.S. air supremacy in the Asiatic- Pacific Theater and the vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack. The battle also exhibited Japan's willingness to make extreme sacrifices in kamikaze attacks aimed at slowing the Allied advance on the Japanese home islands. Background By early 1945, following the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the once-formidable Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet was reduced to just a handful of operational warships and a few remaining aircraft and aircrew. Most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan, with most of the large ships at Kure, Hiroshima. As a final step before the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April 1945. In March, when briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the Imperial Japanese Army was planning extensive air attacks, including the use of kamikaze. The emperor then reportedly asked, \\"But what about the Navy? What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?\\" Now feeling pressured by the emperor to also mount some kind of attack, Japanese Navy commanders conceived a kamikaze-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship Yamato. The resulting plan‚Äîdrafted under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda,‚Äîcalled for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from U.S. carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, the commander of the Ten-Go force, Vice-Admiral Seiichi It≈ç, still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful. Other commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy also had very negative feelings about the operation, believing that it was a waste of human life and fuel. Captain Atsushi ≈åi, who commanded escort fleets, was critical as fuel and resources were diverted from his operation. As he was told that the aim of this operation was \\"the tradition and the glory of the Navy,\\" he shouted: \\"this war is of our nation and why should the honor of our 'surface fleet' be more respected? Who cares about their glory? Damn fools!\\"Atsushi ≈åi, Kaij≈ç Goeisen. Vice Admiral Ry≈´nosuke Kusaka flew from Tokyo to Tokuyama on 5 April in a final attempt to convince the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet‚Äîincluding Admiral It≈ç‚Äîto accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral It≈ç in rejecting it for the same reasons that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa. Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and accepted the proposed plan. The ships' crews were briefed on the nature of the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind if desired; none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm, were ordered off the ships, including sixty-seven naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships' crews now engaged in some last- minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing damage control procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave Yamato and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. In a ceremonial farewell, officers and enlisted men drank sake together. Prelude Routes to the area of battle At 16:00 on 6 April, Yamato, with Admiral It≈ç on board, the light cruiser and eight destroyers departed Tokuyama to begin the mission.Two American submarines, and , sighted the Japanese force as it proceeded south through the Bungo Channel. Although they were unable to attack (due to the ships' speed), they did spend several hours shadowing the Japanese sortie and sending updates of its course to the U.S. fleet. The submarines' messages, which were reportedly sent uncoded, were also picked up by radio operators on the Japanese ships.Skulski, The Battleship Yamato, 12.

At dawn on 7 April, the Japanese force passed the ≈åsumi Peninsula into the open ocean heading south from Ky≈´sh≈´ toward Okinawa. They shifted into a defensive formation, with Yahagi leading Yamato and the eight destroyers deployed in a ring around the two larger ships, with each ship from each other and proceeding at . One of the Japanese destroyers, , developed engine trouble and turned back. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft began to shadow the main force of ships. At 10:00, the Japanese force turned west to make it look like they were withdrawing, but at 11:30, after being detected by two American PBM Mariner flying boats, the Yamato fired a salvo with her bow guns using special , but could not prevent the two planes from shadowing the Japanese force. Then they turned back towards Okinawa. Upon receiving contact reports early on 7 April, U.S. 5th Fleet commander Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered Task Force 54, which consisted mostly of modernized Standard-type battleships under the command of Rear Admiral Morton Deyo (which were engaged in shore bombardment), to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie. Deyo moved to execute his orders, but Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, who commanded Task Force 58 (TF 58), preempted Spruance and Deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers, without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed.Triumph in the Pacific by E.B. Potter, also History of United States Naval Operations in World War II by Samuel Eliot Morison. As a senior naval aviation officer, \\"Mitscher had spent a career fighting the battleship admirals who had steered the navy‚Äôs thinking for most of the current century. One of those was his immediate superior, Raymond Spruance. Mitscher felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry. Though the carriers had mostly fought the great battles of the Pacific, whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt. Here was an opportunity to end the debate forever\\". Around 10:00 on 7 April, Task Groups 58.1 and 58.3 (TG 58.1 and 58.3) began launching almost 400 aircraft in several waves from eight carriers (TG 58.1: , , , ; TG 58.3 , , and ) that were located just east of Okinawa. The aircraft consisted of F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters, SB2C Helldiver dive bombers, and TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. After being informed of Mitscher's launches, Spruance agreed that the airstrikes could go ahead as planned. As a contingency, Spruance ordered Admiral Deyo to assemble a force of six battleships (, , , , , and ), together with seven cruisers (including the large cruisers and ) and 21 destroyers, and to prepare for a surface engagement with Yamato should the airstrikes prove unsuccessful.Order of Battle - Final Sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy - 7 April 1945Authors Garzke and Dulin speculate that the likely outcome of a battle between these two surface forces would have been a victory for the Allies, but at a serious cost due to the large margin of superiority Yamato held over the American battleships in firepower (460 mm vs. 356 mm), armour and speed ( vs. . (Garzke and Dulin (1985)), p. 60. Battle Aircraft such as this SB2C Helldiver begin their attacks on Nova: Sinking the Supership. Around 12:00, the first American aircraft arrived over Yamato; these were F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters, which were under orders to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear to defend the ships below. None did. Since it soon became obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. aircraft were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group‚Äîafter their two-hour flight from Okinawa‚Äîwere thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later at 12:34, Yamato opened fire with her 460 mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , began taking evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. Yamato carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460 mm main guns that fired San Shiki anti-aircraft shells. The U.S. pilots deduced that the use of San Shiki and colored gunfire meant that Yamato's gunners relied on visual aiming and ranging, rather than being radar directed, and as a result \\"were missing with great consistency\\" despite the storm of fire that they put up. The American F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters \\"were supposed to go first, strafing, rocketing, dropping light ordnance, distracting the enemy gunners while the SB2C Helldivers plunged almost straight down with their heavy [armor piercing] bombs\\". This was because the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers \\"needed all the distraction and diversion they could get when they made their dangerous low altitude runs straight at the enemy ships\\". The Avengers mainly attacked from the port side so that if the torpedoes hit that side, it would increase the likelihood of the target ship capsizing. under intense bomb and torpedo attacksCombinedFleet.com At 12:46, a torpedo hit Yahagi directly in her engine room, killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop. Yahagi was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks. The Japanese destroyer attempted to come to Yahagis aid but was attacked and heavily damaged, and sank sometime later. Yahagi capsized and sank at 14:05. During the first attack wave, despite evasive maneuvers that caused most of the bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss, Yamato was hit by two armor-piercing bombs and one torpedo. Her speed was not affected, but one of the bombs started a fire aft of the superstructure that was not extinguished. Also, during the first attack wave, Japanese destroyers and were heavily damaged and taken out of the battle. Hamakaze sank later. Yamato listing to port and on fire Between 13:20 and 14:15, the second and third waves of U.S. aircraft attacked, concentrating on Yamato. During this time, Yamato was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs. The bombs did extensive damage to the topside of the ship, including knocking out power to the gun directors and forcing the anti-aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired, greatly reducing their effectiveness. The torpedo hits‚Äîalmost all on the port side‚Äîcaused Yamato to list enough that capsizing was now an imminent danger. The water damage-control station had been destroyed by a bomb hit making it impossible to counter-flood the specially designed spaces within the ship's hull to counteract hull damage. At 13:33, in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from capsizing, Yamatos damage control team counter-flooded both starboard engine and boiler rooms. This mitigated the danger but also drowned the several hundred crewmen manning those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water. The loss of the starboard engines, plus the weight of the water, caused Yamato to slow to about . At that same moment, the Americans launched another 110 aircraft from Task Group 58. Twenty Avengers made a new torpedo run from 60 degrees to port. Yamato started a sharp turn to port but three torpedoes ripped into her port side amidships, jamming her auxiliary rudder in position hard port.http://www.combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm With Yamato proceeding more slowly and therefore easier to target, U.S. torpedo aircraft concentrated on hitting her rudder and stern with torpedoes in order to affect her steering ability, which they succeeded in doing. At 14:02, after being informed that the ship could no longer steer and was unavoidably sinking, Admiral It≈ç ordered the mission canceled, the crew to abandon ship, and for the remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors. Yamato communicated this message to the other surviving ships by signal flag because her radios had been destroyed. Only known photo of Yamato exploding At 14:05, Yamato was stopped dead in the water and began to capsize. Admiral It≈ç and Captain Aruga refused to abandon her with the rest of the survivors, with It≈ç retiring to the flag cabin while Aruga tied himself to the binnacle. At 14:20, Yamato capsized completely and began to sink (). At 14:23, she suddenly blew up with an explosion so large that it was reportedly heard and seen away in Kagoshima and sent up a mushroom-shaped cloud almost into the air. Japanese survivor Mitsuru Yoshida said that her large explosion downed several U.S. planes observing her end. The explosion is believed to have occurred when the fires ignited by bomb hits reached the main magazines. Attempting to make it back to port, Japanese destroyer was bombed and sunk with all hands by U.S. aircraft. The Japanese destroyer was also crippled by U.S. carrier aircraft attack during the battle and had to be scuttled by other, relatively undamaged Japanese destroyers. Suzutsuki was able to make it to Sasebo, Japan, despite her bow being blown off, by steaming in reverse the entire way. The remaining three less-damaged Japanese destroyers (, , and ) were able to rescue 280 survivors from Yamato (sources differ on the size of Yamatos crew, giving it as between 2,750 and 3,300 men), plus 555 survivors from Yahagi (out of a crew of 1,000) and just over 800 survivors from Isokaze, Hamakaze, and Kasumi. Between 3,700 and 4,250 Japanese naval personnel perished in the battle.Jentshura, p. 39 says that 2,498 Yamato crewmen died. CombinedFleet.com says 3,063 on Yamato died. One possible reason for part of the discrepancy in the numbers is that Admiral It≈ç's staff may not have been included in the total ship's complement. Abe, Saburo, Tokko Yamato Kantai (The Special Attack Fleet Yamato)\\", Kasumi Syuppan Co. 1995, gives the following breakdown in deaths for the Japanese in the operation: Yamato- 3056 killed, 276 survivors; Yahagi- 446 killed; Isokaze- 20 killed; Hamakaze- 100 killed; Yukikaze- 3 killed; Kasumi- 17 killed; Asashimo- 326 killed (all hands); Fuyutsuki- 12 killed; Suzutsuki- 57 killed. The ships took the survivors to Sasebo. Yamato moments after the explosion A total of 10 U.S. aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft strafed Japanese survivors floating in the water.\\"Then the Americans started to shoot with machine guns at the people who were floating, so we all had to dive under.\\" Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers during the time that the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water. Aerial kamikaze attacks During the battle, the Japanese Army conducted an air attack on the U.S. naval fleet at Okinawa as promised, but they failed to sink any ships. Around 115 aircraft‚Äîmany of them kamikaze‚Äîattacked the U.S. ships throughout the day of 7 April. Kamikaze aircraft hit the aircraft carrier , battleship , and destroyer , causing moderate damage to Hancock and Maryland and heavy damage to Bennett. About 100 of the Japanese aircraft were lost in the attack. Aftermath Ten-Go was the last major Japanese naval operation of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations for the rest of the conflict. Suzutsuki was never repaired. Fuyutsuki was repaired but hit a U.S. air-dropped mine at Moji, Japan, on 20 August 1945, and was not subsequently repaired. Yukikaze survived the war almost undamaged. Hatsushimo hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945, near Maizuru, Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war. Maryland was kept out of the war following the kamikaze attacks. Okinawa was declared secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945,after an intense and costly battle. Japan surrendered in August 1945, after being bombed twice with atomic weapons. The apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice so many of its people using suicidal tactics such as Operation Ten-Go and in the Battle of Okinawa reportedly was a factor in the American decision to employ atomic weapons against Japan. The story of Operation Ten-Go is revered to some degree in modern Japan as evidenced by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland.; One of the reasons the event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of the battleship Yamato could serve as a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.Jiji Press, \\"Yamato survivor, 87, recalls doomed mission\\", Japan Times, 20 August 2015  References   Footnotes   Bibliography     * Further reading  External links  * The official site of the NOVA documentary with additional information on the subject.

It is now called APM Podcasts APMG began a series of radio station acquisition in Florida that ended up being its Classical South Florida (CSF) station group costing $30 million which was mostly paid for using bonds. APMG purchased WKCP in 2007 from Trinity International Foundation for $20 million. From Barry University in 2011, APMG purchased WPBI-FM in West Palm Beach for $4 million. With in a year, Way Media sold WNPS-FM in Fort Myers to APMG for $4.3 million. The subsidiary was losing $1 million per year. Educational Media Foundation offered $21.7 million in May 2015 for the stations. A large number of CSF's board directors resigned at APMG's acceptance of the offer before consulting the CSF board and that other purchaser could have been found for the stations.

Originally introduced in the mid-1990s, the architecture is an enhancement of the Freescale 68HC11. Programs written for the HC11 are usually compatible with the HC12, which has a few extra instructions. The first 68HC12 derivatives had a maximum bus speed of 8 MHz and flash memory sizes up to 128 KB. Architecture of the 68HC12 Like the 68HC11, the 68HC12 has two 8-bit accumulators A and B (referred to as a single 16-bit accumulator, D, when A & B are cascaded so as to allow for operations involving 16 bits), two 16-bit registers X and Y, a 16-bit program counter, a 16-bit stack pointer and an 8-bit Condition Code Register. Unlike the 68HC11 the processor has 16bit internal data paths The 68HC12 adds to and replaces a small number of 68HC11 instructions with new forms that are closer to the 6809 processor. More significantly it changes the instruction encodings to be far more dense and adds many 6809 like indexing features, some with even more flexibility. The net result is that code sizes are typically 30% smaller.Sibigtroth, James M. (1996) \\"Transporting M68HC11 Code to M68HC12 Devices\\", Motorola Semiconductor Application Note AN1284/D, Motorola. HCS12/MC9S12 derivatives Beginning in 2000 the family was extended with the introduction of the MC9S12 derivatives which have bus speeds of up to 25 MHz and flash sizes up to 512 KB. The MC9S12NE64 was introduced by Freescale in September 2004, claiming to be the \\"industry's first single-chip fast-Ethernet Flash microcontroller.\\" It features a 25 MHz HCS12 CPU, 64 KB of FLASH EEPROM, 8 KB of RAM, and an Ethernet 10/100 Mbit/s controller. MC9S12X derivatives The MC9S12XDP512 which was introduced in 2004 has a bus speed of 40 MHz and a peripheral co- processor known as the XGATE which allows for some tasks to be offloaded from the CPU. The CPU of the S12X derivative also features several new instructions to increase performance. Freescale announced the MC9S12XEP100 in May 2006 to further extend the S12X family to 50 MHz bus speed and add a Memory protection unit (based on segmentation) and a hardware scheme to provide emulated EEPROM. HCS12 products contain a single processor, the HCS12X feature the additional XGATE peripheral processor. The S12X family offer two main methods to address more than 64KBytes. * Paged memory regions in the 64 KB local map: PPAGE for paged program data, RPAGE for paged RAM, EPAGE for paged EEPROM/flash * Global addressing permits access to any addresses in the 8 MB address space. GPAGE is used in conjunction with special opcodes. (gldaa etc.)  XGATE  The XGATE co-processor is a 16-bit RISC processor operating at twice the main bus clock. It offloads work from the S12X core by handling interrupts only and does not run a background loop. The first versions of the XGATE do not allow for higher priority interrupts to pre-empt a currently handled interrupt, but the \\"XGATEV3\\" as featured in the 9S12XEP100 (and others) does allow this. The S12X can trigger software interrupts on the XGATE core and vice versa. A semaphore system is implemented to allow the S12X and XGATE cores to synchronize access to peripherals. Typically the XGATE code is copied to RAM at device startup and then executed from RAM for a speed benefit. The XGATE has a partial 64KByte address space with no paging. The registers share addresses, but the flash and RAM appear at different addresses between the cores. (See the datasheet for more details.)

NAPS is located on Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. The mission of the Naval Academy Preparatory School is \\"To enhance Midshipman Candidates' moral, mental, and physical foundations to prepare them for success at the United States Naval Academy\\". History The Naval Academy Preparatory School is the Navy's fourth oldest school; only the Naval War College, the Naval Postgraduate School, and the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland are older. Informal preparatory classes began as early as 1915. In 1918, the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels signed a provision to have up to 100 sailors from the fleet to be eligible for entry to the Academy. Due to the difficult nature of the Naval Academy's entrance examination, then Undersecretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt (future 32nd President) also allowed for a school to be founded to prepare Sailors and Marines for entry. The first official classes were established at Naval Station, Newport in Rhode Island and Naval Station Treasure Island / San Francisco in California in 1920. A year later the schools were moved to Norfolk, Virginia and San Diego, California. San Diego classes were later disestablished and NAPS classes remained solely in Norfolk until 1942, when the new Naval Academy Preparatory School opened in Newport, R.I. In early 1943, NAPS moved to the United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, a facility of several hundred acres located above the Susquehanna River in Port Deposit, Maryland at the former Tome School campus, some northeast of Baltimore, Maryland. NAPS returned to Newport while the Bainbridge Center was temporarily inactive during 15 months around 1950. When Bainbridge was reactivated in 1951 because of the Korean War, the preparatory school returned to Maryland. In August 1974, NAPS returned to its permanent home in Newport. From 1915 to the year 1968 NAPS was exclusively for Sailors and Marines who were of \\"Officer Caliber\\" but lacked the academic foundation for the rigors at The United States Naval Academy. In 1968, The first male \\"Direct Entries\\" were admitted to NAPS. Following the congressional authorization of women to attend all military service academies, women were admitted in 1976. Although NAPS primarily serves as an institution to prepare Midshipman candidates to attend The United States Naval Academy; from the years 1958 to 2008 and again from 2016 to the present day, it also began to prepare Cadet candidates for the United States Air Force Academy (1958‚Äì1961), the United States Coast Guard Academy (1979‚Äì2008, 2016‚Äìpresent) and, Midshipman candidates for the United States Merchant Marine Academy (1991 to 2004). CAPT Cory Howes, USN in Bahrain In 2006, The Naval Academy Preparatory School named their newly built dormitory in honor of alumnus Colonel John Ripley. Ripley Hall is located on 440 Meyerkord Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. Aerial view of Naval Station Newport Admissions To gain admission to the United States Naval Academy upon graduation, Midshipman Candidates must have a GPA above 2.2, no failing grade in any subject, meet the body fat standards, pass the Physical Readiness Test (PRT), improving or sustained course grades and SAT scores, favorable conduct and honor aptitude, and get a favorable recommendation from the Commanding Officer. Midshipman Candidates who might be below the standard may still have a chance of admission to USNA. After finals are over, their fate is decided on a day known as Black Monday. Organization The mission of the United States Naval Academy Preparatory School is to enhance Midshipman Candidates moral, mental, and physical foundations to prepare them for success at the United States Naval Academy. The student body, which is organized as a battalion, is divided into three companies, which are then divided into two platoons. Each platoon is divided into four squads in order to carry out orders with effective results. While attending NAPS, all midshipman candidates are in active duty military status, holding the rank of Midshipman Candidate, equivalent to the Navy's Seaman Recruit, at the enlisted pay grade of E-1, although this is significantly reduced in an effort to allocate funds into the Battalion Activity Fund (BAF) and to pay off all debts owed due for issued uniforms and miscellaneous items. The BAF is used to pay for physical fitness clothing and equipment, textbooks and various student activity expenses, such as the Army-Navy game, Graduation Ball and the like.\\"Naval Academy Preparatory School Reefpoints.\\" MS. Naval Academy Preparatory School, Newport. A common nickname for a Midshipmen Candidates is \\"NAPSter\\". Within the battalion there exists a midshipman candidate led chain of command. The midshipmen candidates holding positions of authority are called \\"stripers\\", because they wear collar devices with the number of stripes that are assigned to each position. Stripers are selected by the military staff and serve the term of one marking period, after which they rotate out with new midshipmen candidates. The responsibilities of stripers are: delegating orders from the senior military staff to the students, taking accountability of the battalion, writing the watchbill for other students, organizing their respective companies and platoons for each event the midshipmen candidates attend, and maintaining general cleanliness of Ripley Hall. The head of the entire battalion is the Battalion Commander and Battalion XO and MA. The Battalion XO is in charge of TAPS sheets every night, which is an accountability process throughout the battalion that ensures all the Midshipman Candidates are back at Ripley Hall safe.

The film has inspired the creation of the sport Jugger. Plot In a barren world caused by wars waged in the 20th century and now forgotten, most live from hand to mouth in enclaves known as \\"market-towns\\" or \\"dog-towns\\", scrounging out a bare subsistence harvesting hardy crops, raising dogs as food, and trading in trinkets from the past. What little entertainment exists comes primarily from a brutal sport known as The Game. It is played by bands of roving teams known as juggs, who challenge local teams. They might be considered professional athletes, as they make their living through the tribute paid by the town people, should they defeat the local team. Their trophy is the dog skull from the town. The Game involves two armoured teams of five attempting to score by placing a dog skull on the opposing team's goalpost. One unarmed player‚Äîthe \\"quick\\"‚Äîruns with the skull while being protected by his/her teammates from attack by the opposing team. However, not all in this time live so sparsely. The Nine Cities, buried deep underground, are home to affluent and powerful members of the aristocracy. Each of The Nine Cities fields its own team of juggs in an organization known as The League, and its membership is maintained with a fresh stream of new players who are proven veterans of the travelling \\"dog-town\\" games by their collection of trophy skulls. Members of The League live in luxury almost equal to that of aristocrats. It is a dream among roving juggs to be good enough to get The League's attention and, with it, all of the luxuries afforded a League player. The team consists of Sallow (Rutger Hauer), Dog-Boy (Justin Monjo), Mbulu (Delroy Lindo), Big Cimber (Anna Katarina), and Young Gar (Vincent D'Onofrio). Sallow, the team leader, has played in the League of the Nine Cities before, but was cast out because of his indiscretions with an Overlord's daughter. Kidda (Joan Chen), an ambitious peasant girl, joins the team after a game in her dog town where she virtually destroyed her competition. She and Gar inspire Sallow to challenge The League and expunge his past. But Kidda and Gar do not realise that the City games are for much more than honour and victory, they will need to fight for their very survival. The Game is played much harder and meaner in the Nine Cities.

About ten minutes were cut. The biggest difference is in the ending. In the American release, the credits roll shortly after the climax, even though picture continues to roll, showing certain conversations with music covering the dialogue. In the longer cut, there are denouement scenes. The US DVD release of the film matches the US theatrical cut in being much shorter than the original film. Full versions were released on VHS in the early 1990s in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan. Various distributors began releasing the original cut on DVD in early 2001, known as the extended version or by the title \\"Salute to the Jugger\\". In 2017, a 2-disc Blu-ray set with both cuts of the film was released in Japan. Location The Blood of Heroes was shot in the desert of Coober Pedy, Australia.
