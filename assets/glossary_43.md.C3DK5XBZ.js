Background  Kindness priming refers to the observed effect by which individuals who are exposed to an act of kindness ‚Äì the priming ‚Äì subsequently notice more of the positive features of the world than they would otherwise. A person receiving a free voucher from a stranger, for example, may become more inclined to perceive the intentions of others around them as good. Some researchers hypothesize that kindness priming involves the same cognitive circuitry that enables memory priming. By activating neural representations of positive affect, an act of kindness stimulates increased activity in related associative networks. It is therefore more likely that subsequent stimuli will activate these related, positive networks, and so the positive affect continues to be carried forward in a feed forward manner. Additionally, kindness priming has also been shown to inoculate against negative stimuli in the short term, thus temporarily improving an individual's resilience.  Effects  To measure the effects of kindness priming, investigators typically generate an experimental paradigm measuring behavioral reactions and cognitive self-reports. Often these tests include evaluation of additional effective primes, such as hostility. Typically, subjects are exposed to an effective prime or act of kindness, such as being given a box of candy, and subsequently given introspective tests measuring cognitive traits like affect, memory, learning, or attention. Some experiments include a behavioral observation instead, and often utilize paradigms from memory studies, such as learning time, reaction time, target identification, recall, and word generation. The first attempt to identify kindness priming was derivative of a memory experiment performed by Teasdale and Fogarty in 1979. In their experiment, two mood states, happy and depressed, were generated in the participants at different trials. Participants were then presented with stimulus of either happy or sad emotional valence, and subsequently asked to recall the presented items. This study showed that in the happy state, participants were more likely to recall the happy stimuli, and vice versa for the depressed state.  Hypothesis  Some researchers believe that kindness priming operates similarly to associative memories, and thus utilizes common neurological mechanisms. Teasdale and Fogarty were the first to hypothesize that affect led to differences in learning speed and memory retrieval, on the bases of congruent valence of mood and target material via common associations. Later, it was presumed that humans store material (including affect) in memory that later acts as cues for associative networks in the presence of novel environmental stimuli. These associative hypotheses were then refined to exclude opposing stimuli: specifically, Clark and Waddell postulated that the positive affect primed by acts of kindness causes a positive cognitive bias that leaves the subject relatively immune to \\"unambiguously unpleasant stimuli\\".  Applications  Kindness priming is similar to general affect priming and thus has similar applications. In the field of positive psychology, kindness priming is a valuable tool for spreading positive affect in a feed forward cycle. By inducing a positive mood in others, and immunizing them against negative stimuli, it is believed that they will feel compelled to produce acts of kindness for others, propagating the effects. This spread of positive affect and increased resilience is in line with the goals of positive psychology and recommended therein to be pursued alongside loving-kindness meditation to improve general well-being. Marketing researchers have capitalized on kindness priming, as corporate studies have shown it may increase a subject's valence toward a brand.

It is also the coldest object of its type found in interstellar space, having a temperature in the range . Characterization =Observations= Stars and brown dwarfs, including WISE 0855‚àí0714, closest to the Sun‚Äîthe year distances were determined is noted. The WISE object was detected in March 2013, and follow-up observations were taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Gemini North telescope. The name WISE J085510.83‚àí071442.5 includes the coordinates and indicates that the object is located in the constellation Hydra. =Distance and proper motion= Based on direct observations, WISE 0855‚àí0714 has a large parallax, which specifically relates to its distance from the Solar System. This phenomenon results in a distance of around , with a small margin of error due to the strength of the parallax effect and the clarity of observations. WISE 0855‚àí0714's proper motion across the sky is also directly observed over time, causing it to stand out in the observations, but the proper motion is itself a combination of its speed in the galactic neighborhood relative to the Solar System as well as its proximity to the Solar System. If it were moving exactly as fast but farther away, if it were moving more slowly but closer, or if it were moving more quickly near to the Sun but moving at a high angle towards or away from the Sun, it would have a smaller proper motion. =Spectrometry= Its luminosity in different bands of the thermal infrared in combination with its absolute magnitude‚Äîbecause of its known distance‚Äîwas used to place it in context of different models; the best characterization of its brightness was in the W2 band of at an apparent magnitude of , though it was brighter into the deeper infrared. Infrared images taken with the Magellan Baade Telescope suggest evidence of water clouds. =Model-derived understanding= Based on models of brown dwarfs WISE 0855‚àí0714's is estimated to have a mass of . This mass is in the range of a sub-brown dwarf or other planetary-mass object. As of 2003, the International Astronomical Union considers an object with a mass above , capable of fusing deuterium, to be a brown dwarf. A lighter object and one orbiting another object is considered a planet. So far this WISE object is alone, though it could be a rogue planet, something first identified in 2004 in the case of Cha 110913-773444. Combining its luminosity, distance, and mass it is estimated to be the coldest-known brown dwarf, with a modeled effective temperature of , depending on the model.

It is an ancient prime text which is one of the treatises on Advaita school of classical Indian Metaphysics. Textual History and Structure Dattatreya Parshurama TripurƒÅ means \\"three cities\\" or \\"the trinity.\\" Rahasya means \\"secret\\" or \\"mystery.\\" In a sense there is no secret to be revealed. It is only due to lack of wisdom that humans don't experience their true nature. Therefore, mystery would be a more appropriate translation. Thus, Tripura Rahasya means the Mystery beyond the Trinity. The three cities or states of consciousness are waking (JƒÅg·πõat), dreaming (Svapna) and deep sleep (Su·π£upti). The underlying consciousness in them all is called Sri Tripura, the Mother Goddess Chandika. The Tripura Rahasya expounds the teachings of the supreme spiritual truth. The highest truth was first taught by Lord Shiva to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu incarnated on earth as Sri Dattatreya, Lord of the Avadhutas, who taught this to Parasurama, who later taught it to HaritƒÅyana. The Tripura Rahasya is a dialogue between Lord Dattatreya and Parasurama. It is also called the HaritƒÅyana SamhitƒÅ after its author HaritƒÅyana, son of Harita. It is said to consist of 12,000 slokas in three sections - the J√±ƒÅna Kha·πá·∏ça (Section on Supreme Wisdom), the MahƒÅtamya Kha·πá·∏ça (Section on the Greatness of Sri Devi), and the CaryƒÅ Kha·πá·∏ça (Section on Conduct). Of these the first consists of 6,687 slokas; the second of 2,163 slokas; and the third is untraceable. Historical context Jamadagni was a Brahmin saint who lived in the forest with his wife Renuka and his sons, of whom Parasurama was the youngest, the most renowned and valiant. The country was then ruled by Haihayas, a certain clan of Kshatriyas. Some of them came into a clash with Parasurama, but fared the worse. They dared not challenge him afterwards. Their rancor, however, remained, and they could not resist their longing for revenge. They seized their opportunity when Parasurama was far away from the hermitage and attacked and killed his saintly father. On the son‚Äôs return, the mother narrated the unprovoked murder of the saint; she also desired that her husband‚Äôs body should be cremated on the banks of the Ganges and that she might perform Sati by mounting the funeral pyre. Parasurama vowed that he would clear the earth of the Kshatriya vermin. He placed his father‚Äôs corpse on one shoulder and took his living mother on the other and set out for to the Ganges. While passing through a forest an Avadhuta, by name Dattatreya, saw Renuka and stopped the young man who carried her. The Avadhutha addressed Renuka as Shakti incarnate, of unparalleled might (‡§ê‡§ï‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ) and worshipped her. She blessed him and told him of her life on earth and her resolve to end it. She also advised her son to look to Dattatreya for help when needed. Parasurama went on his way and fulfilled his mother‚Äôs desire. He then challenged every Kshatriya in the land and killed them all. Their blood was collected in a pool in Kurukshetra, and Parasurama offered oblations to his forefathers with it. His dead ancestors appeared and told him to desist from his bloody revenge. Accordingly, he retired into a mountain fastness and lived as a hermit. Hearing on one occasion of the prowess of Rama, his wrath rekindled and he came back to challenge him. Rama was born of Dasaratha who, though a Kshatriya, escaped his doom by a ruse. Rama accepted Parasurama‚Äôs challenge and got the better of him. Dattatreya There was once a dutiful wife whose husband was, however, a licentious wretch. This couple unwittingly disturbed Rishi Mandavya, who had been placed on a spear by a misguided king. The Rishi, who was in agony but not dying, cursed them, saying that the husband would die at sunrise and the wife be left a widow. Widowhood is most abhorrent to a Hindu lady and considered worse than death. By the force of her intense loyalty to her husband she resisted the curse of the Rishi: The Sun could not rise, and the Gods were rendered impotent. The Gods in council resolved to approach Anasuya ‚Äî the ideal of wife-hood ‚Äî to ask her to prevail on the other lady to relent. Anasuya promised her that she would restore her dead husband to life, and so the matter ended satisfactorily for all. The three chief Gods then agreed to be born as sons to Anasuya. Brahma was born as the Chandra (Moon); Shiva as Durvasa; and Sri Narayana as Datta. The last is also called ‚ÄúDatta Atreya,‚Äù of which the latter word is the patronymic derived from Atri, the husband of Anasuya. Sri Dattatreya is the foremost in the line of divine teachers incarnate on earth. Parasurama's encounter with Samvarta After encounter with Rama, Parasurama returned crest- fallen and on his way met an Avadhuta named Samvarta, the brother of Brihaspati who advised him to seek Dattatreya. Later he encountered Sri Dattatreya who instructed him in the Truth with added injunction that it should be communicated to Haritayana who would later seek the truth from him and so led him to salvation. Parasurama thus realized the Self by the guidance of Sri Datta and dwelt on the Malaya Hill in South India. Later a Brahmin Sumedha, son of Harita (hence the name \\"Haritayana\\") sought Parasurama to learn the highest good from him, who in turn imparted to him the knowledge which he had gained from Dattatreya. Parasurama told him also that his Master had predicted the compilation of the knowledge of the Highest Truth by Haritayana for the benefit of mankind. Translation Tripura Rahasya was venerated by Ramana Maharshi, he often quoted from it and regretted that it was not available in English. As a consequence Sri Munagala Venkataramaiah (now Swami Ramanananda Saraswathi) took up the work of translation in 1936.This was first published in parts in the Bangalore Mythic Society's Journal (Quarterly) from January 1938 to April 1940 and afterwards collected into book form. A newer translation by \\"SAMVID\\" was published in 2000 by Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning (Bangalore). The translator has based her/his introduction on the commentary of Srinivasa (Tatparyadipika) and writes that s/he has attempted a faithful and literal translation, even at the possible occasional expense of readability. Sakti Sadhana: Steps to Samadhi is another reputed translation of Tripura Rahasya. This is published by the Himalayan Institute with an introductory essay by Swami Rama. Pandit Rajmani Tigunait translated the Sanskrit original into easy to follow English, while also retaining the spiritual gravity.

History The tunnel was constructed in 1969-1971 by the Republic of China Armed Forces for ships to avoid bad weather and attacks from the People's Liberation Army in the aftermath of Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. It took 820 days for the tunnel to be completed which were mostly done by hand, with some exception of small amount of explosive. Some of the workers lost their lives during the construction process. At that time, the tunnel could harbor 120 small naval vessels but it was badly damaged after a severe typhoon hit the area. After the return of Matsu Islands from military to civilians in 1992, the tunnel was remodeled and opened to the public in 2000. Geology The tunnel is 700 meters in length. It goes deep into the granite mountain and there is a waterway with 18 meters in height, 10 meters in width and 640 meters in length. Water inside the tunnel goes as deep as 6 meters.

Playing career  Park was the captain of the South Korea under-20 squad which won the 1978 AFC Youth Championship. On 8 March 1981, Park made his senior international debut against Japan, which ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory. Park performed his mandatory military service in Army FC after he joined the semi-professional club Korea First Bank FC. From 1984 to 1988, Park played for Lucky-Goldstar FC, and contributed to the 1985 K League title. He received the K League Best XI award in that season.  Managerial career  = South Korea national Olympic football team = Park was one of the two assistant managers of Guus Hiddink at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In August 2002, Park was appointed as head coach of the South Korean side for the 2002 Asian Games by performing successfully as the senior team assistant. However, Korea Football Association (KFA) had not done any preparation for the 2002 Asian Games since there was no manager or coaching staff for two years. KFA had focused on the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which was co-hosted in South Korea, so Park had to prepare for the tournament in two months. In addition, KFA was criticized that Park worked without getting paid because they formally didn't sign with him. South Korea lost to Iran after penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals, and later won a bronze medal. Park was sacked after the tournament. = Coaching in South Korea = In August 2005, Park became the inaugural manager of the newly-formed Gyeongnam FC in the K League. Gyeongnam finished fourth in the 2007 K League season, but Park left the team due to internal conflict. In December 2007, he succeeded Huh Jung-moo as coach of the Chunnam Dragons. The team finished as the runners-up of the 2008 League Cup and sixth in the 2009 K League. He later resigned due to poor performances in the 2010 season. From 2012 to 2015, Park coached the military team Sangju Sangmu FC in South Korea. Under his guidance, his squad won the country's second-division league, K League Challenge, in 2013 and 2015. He left the team after his contract expired after the 2015 season. In 2017, Park was appointed manager of Changwon City FC, a third- division team. Changwon won the 2017 Korea National League Championship, and he was named the tournament's best manager. = Vietnam national teams = On 29 September 2017, Park was appointed the head coach of the Vietnam national football team. Also in charge of the under-23 side, the team reached the final of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship, which is Vietnam's first final in the official AFC competitions. At the 2018 Asian Games, his side also advanced to the semi-finals and finished fourth for the first time in 56 years, with Park earning praise for his management. On 15 December 2018, the Vietnamese team under Park won the AFF Championship after defeating Malaysia, 3‚Äì2 on aggregate, in the second leg of the finals in M·ªπ ƒê√¨nh National Stadium of Hanoi. This was Vietnam's first regional championship in ten years. In the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Vietnam reached the quarter-finals but lost to eventual runner-up Japan, 1‚Äì0. On 6 November 2019, Park had extended his contract to coach the Vietnam and the under-23 team until 2022. With the Olympic side , Park won the gold medal at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, thus winning the first football title for Vietnam as a united country at the games as Vietnam previously lost in the final on five occasions.

While coaching Vietnam, he was nicknamed \\"Coach Terminator\\" by the Vietnamese media, due to his tendency of defeating a number of notable managers and, directly or indirectly, forcing them into being sacked. Managers that were sacked or resigned for losing to Park's Vietnam include Guus Hiddink, J√°n Kocian, Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson and Bert van Marwijk.

The santur (also sant≈´r, santour, santoor) (, is a hammered dulcimer of Iranian or Mesopotamian origins.\\\\--- Rashid, Subhi Anwar (1989).

History The santur was invented and developed in the area of Iran and Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). \\"The earliest sign of it comes from Assyrian and Babylonian stone carvings (669 B.C.); it shows the instrument being played while hanging from the player's neck\\" (35). This instrument was traded and traveled to different parts of the Middle East. Each country customized and designed its own versions to adapt to their musical scales and tunings. The santur was originated in the country that is known today as Iran. The original santur was made with tree bark and stones, and strung with goat intestines. The Mesopotamian santur has been claimed to be the father of the harp, the Chinese yangqin, the harpsichord, the qanun, the cimbalom, and the American and European hammered dulcimers. Name The name 'santur' has several possible derivations. It has been thought by some to be derived via Aramaic from the Greek psalterion (, \\"plucking instrument\\"), which quickly became the generic term in the Greek world for a plucked instrument and which was widely used across the Graeco-Roman world, including Syria and Northern Mesopotamia. The earliest Aramaic form is psantƒìrƒ´n in the late Biblical book of Daniel (Daniel 3:5), already close to an alternative form of the Arabic, san·π≠ƒ´r. Alternatively the word may be of Iranian origin, meaning \\"a quick accent\\" or perhaps \\"one hundred strings\\". A further suggestion is that the name is derived from Sumerian \\"sant\\" and \\"Ur\\", meaning sound of Ur in Sumerian. Description The oval-shaped Mezrabs (mallets) are feather-weight and are held between the thumb, index, and middle fingers. A typical Persian santur has two sets of nine bridges, providing a range of approximately three octaves. The right-hand strings are made of brass or copper, while the left- hand strings are made of steel. A total of 18 bridges divide the santur into three positions. Over each bridge cross four strings tuned in unison, spanning horizontally across the right and left side of the instrument. There are three sections of nine pitches: each for the bass, middle and higher octave called behind the left bridges comprising 27 notes altogether. The top \\"F\\" note is repeated twice, creating a total of 25 separate tones in the santur. The Persian santur is primarily tuned to a variety of different diatonic scales utilizing 1/4 tones which are designated into 12 modes (dastgahs) of Persian classical music. These 12 Dastgahs are the repertory of Persian classical music known as the Radif. They also had 16 inch botos. Derivations Similar musical instruments have been present since medieval times all over the world, including Armenia, China, Greece, India, etc. The Indian santoor is wider, more rectangular and has more strings. Its corresponding mallets are also held differently and played with a different technique. The eastern European version of the santur called the cimbalom, which is much larger and chromatic, is used to accompany Hungarian folk music, Eastern European Jewish music, and Slavic music, as well as Romani music. Iraqi santur Typical Iraqi santur Chalghi santur player playing on a non-standard Iraqi santur The Iraqi santur (also santour, santoor ) () is a hammered dulcimer of Mesopotamian origin.\\\\--- Rashid, Subhi Anwar (1989). Al- ºƒÄlƒÅt al-musƒ´qƒ´yya al-mu·π£ƒÅhiba lil-MaqƒÅm al-  ªIrƒÅqƒ´. Baghdad: Matba ªat al- ªUmmƒÅl al-Markazƒ´yya. It is a trapezoid box zither with a walnut body and 92 steel (or bronze) strings. The strings, tuned to the same pitch in groups of four, are struck with two wooden mallets called \\"midhrab\\". The tuning of these 23 sets of strings extends from the lower yakah (G) up to jawab jawab husayni (a). The bridges are called dama (chessmen in Iraqi Arabic) because they look like pawns. It is native to Iraq, syria, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Greece (the Aegean coasts) and Azerbaijan. It is the main instrument used in the classical Maqam al-iraqi tradition along with the Iraqi spike fiddle joza. ('Music of the Arabs' ). The instrument was brought to Europe by the Arabs through North Africa and Spain during the Middle Ages and also to China where it was referred to as the \\"foreign qin\\". The Iraqi santur has, since its inception, been fully chromatic allowing for full maqam modulations. It uses 12 bridges of steel strings on both sides. Three of these bridges are movable: B half flat qaraar, E half flat, and B half flat jawaab. The non-standard version of the Iraqi santur includes extra bridges so that there's no need to move those three bridges. However, playing it is a bit harder than playing the standard 12-bridge santur. For a video demonstration, see Wesam al-Azzawy's video links in the sections below.

History Transfield Holdings's origins can be traced to 1956 when an Italian-born immigrant electrical engineer, Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, who was joined soon after by Carlo Salteri, a former colleague from Electric Power Transmission, an offshoot of Milan based Societa' Anonima Elettrificazione, which was constructing powerlines. The logo, designed by Belgiorno-Nettis, reflected its electricity industry origins; it was intended to represent a high-voltage transmission tower, with an accompanying red electrical spark.History Broadspectrum Transfield's first contract was for the fabrication and installation of a soaking pit and slab mill for Australian Iron & Steel at Port Kembla. In May 1957, sixteen hectares of land was purchased in the Western Sydney suburb of Seven Hills. In 1958 Transfield won its first major contract, to build of the powerline from Magill to Port Augusta in South Australia. Another early project, was a chairlift at Thredbo, the longest in the world at the time.New Kosciusko Chairlft Canberra Times 26 June 1958 page 1 In 1965, subsidiary Transavia Corporation commenced producing the Transavia PL-12 Airtruk agricultural aircraft. Together Belgiorno-Nettis and Saltieri built Transfield into one of Australia's most successful companies focused on major engineering projects such as bridges, tunnels, dams, hydroelectric and coal power stations, oil rigs, concert halls, sugar mills and power lines. Included in Transfield's list of achievements are the construction of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. By the early 1980s, Transfield had in excess of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of $350 million. Within five years it grew to be the biggest engineering firm in southeast Asia. When visiting Australia in 1986 Pope John Paul II toured the Transfield factory located at Seven Hills. Transfield established a naval shipbuilding capability in Australia with the acquisition of Williamstown Dockyard in Melbourne in 1989. In the early 1990s, it bullt two Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates for the Royal Australian Navy. In 1989, Belgiorno-Nettis and Salteri stood down as joint managing directors in favour of their eldest sons, Marco Belgiorno-Zegna and Paul Salteri. After a dispute between Belgiorno-Nettis and Salteri in 1995, the business was split, with the Belgiorno-Nettis family taking the construction and infrastructure side of the business, and the Salteris the defence and shipbuilding work under the name Tenix.Transfield partners go to war Australian Financial Review 27 July 1998 In May 2001, the operations and maintenance division was spun-off and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as Transfield Services with Transfield Holdings having a 45% shareholding.Transfield seeking $10m from Seven Hills auction Sydney Morning Herald 17 February 2001Commencement of Official Quotation - Transfield Services Limited Australian Securities Exchange 30 April 2001Distribution of Shareholders as at 9/05/2001 Transfield Services 9 May 2001 In December 2002, the construction business was sold to John Holland.Family sells Transfield assets Sydney Morning Herald 13 December 2002 In September 2014, Transfield Holdings sold its remaining shareholding in Transfield Services.Transfield Holdings sells it shares in Transfield Services Transfield Holdings 9 September 2014 In 2015, Transfield Holdings transformed from a private equity business into an investment holding company, managed by the respective family offices of Guido and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis.Management Transfield Holdings Major projects Major projects undertaken included: Investments =Current= Patronage of the Arts During its first fifty years of operations Transfield's contribution to the arts has enriched and changed for good Australia's cultural landscape. It has always been Franco Belgiorno-Nettis' cherished belief that inventiveness in new art is encouraging innovation in business and industry. He often stated that \\"artists and engineers have a lot in common: they both have an idea and make it concrete\\". Franco also, as he put it, \\"felt I could be an unofficial ambassador, use Transfield to build a link between Italian and Australian culture\\". =The Transfield Art Prize= In 1961 the Company launched the Transfield Art Prize, at that time the richest in Australia, at ¬£1,000. The Prize made a significant contribution in developing the wealth of talent among Australian artists, launched some of them to international notoriety, such as Fred Williams, the 1964 winner, and gave Transfield the opportunity to establish close links with the Australian political, financial and business world. The Prize was discontinued in 1971, when Transfield realised that something else could be done in a more meaningful way. =The Australian Book Review - Transfield Book Production Awards= in 1963, the company, in association with the Australian Book Review, launched the Australian Book Review-Transfield Book Production Awards, aimed at raising the standard of literary culture and design of quality books in Australia. The ¬£350 Awards were made until 1968. =The Foundry= In June 1968, Transfield established, at a cost of $25,000, the first Australian foundry for sculpture at its Seven Hills factory, making these facilities available to artists at subsidised cost. Franco was particularly fond of his Sculpture Studio, where he cast his own works. =Biennale of Sydney= It was the establishment of the Biennale of Sydney, in November 1973, that constitutes the most important contribution to Australian and international arts by Transfield. From 1973, when Prime Minister Gough Whitlam officially opened the first Biennale at the newly opened Sydney Opera House until today, Transfield has been the major sponsor of this event. During the span of over 30 years, the company probably invested over $6 million in-kind and cash to the fifteen Biennales. Amongst other contributions, it refurbished the Biennale venues at Pier 2/3 and Bond Store 4, Walsh Bay for three Biennales. It has also provided three Chairmen, including Franco, Guido and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis.

The instrument is generally made of walnut and has 25 bridges. Each bridge has 4 strings, making for a total of 100 strings. It is a traditional instrument in Jammu and Kashmir, and dates back to ancient times. It was called Shatha Tantri Veena in ancient Sanskrit texts. Development In ancient Sanskrit texts, it has been referred to as shatatantri vina (100-stringed vina). In Kashmir the santoor was used to accompany folk music. It is played in a style of music known as the Sufiana Mausiqi. Some researchers slot it as an improvised version of a primitive instrument played in the Mesopotamian times (1600-900 B.C.) Sufi mystics used it as an accompaniment to their hymns. In Indian santoor playing, the specially-shaped mallets (mezrab) are lightweight and are held between the index and middle fingers. A typical santoor has two sets of bridges, providing a range of three octaves. The Indian santoor is more rectangular and can have more strings than its Persian counterpart, which generally has 72 strings. Musical instruments very similar to the santoor are traditionally used all over the world. Characteristics The trapezoid framework is generally made out of either walnut or maple wood. The top and bottom boards sometimes can be either plywood or veneer. On the top board, also known as the soundboard, wooden bridges are placed, in order to seat stretched metal strings across. The strings, grouped in units of 3 or 4, are tied on nails or pins on the left side of the instrument and are stretched over the sound board on top of the bridges to the right side. On the right side there are steel tuning pegs or tuning pins, as they are commonly known, that allows tuning each unit of strings to a desired musical note or a frequency or a pitch. Technique The santoor is played while sitting in an asana called ardha-padmasana position and placing it on top of the lap. While playing, the broad side is closer to the waist of the musician and the shorter side is away from the musician. It is played with a pair of light wooden mallets held with both hands. The santoor is a very delicate instrument and is very sensitive to light strokes and glides. The strokes are played always on the strings either closer to the bridges or a little away from bridges. Both styles result in different tones. Sometimes strokes by one hand can be muffled by the other hand by using the face of the palm just to create variety.

Biography =Early life= Gustavus Poznanski was born in 1804 in Storchnest, South Prussia, now a part of Poland.Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities - Charleston, South Carolina, Institute of Southern Jewish LifeAmerican Jewish Archives: Gustavus Poznanski biography.Michael A. Meyer, Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism, Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University Press, 1995, p. 233-234 Robert Laurence Moore, Religious outsiders and the making of American, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1986, p. 79 He was one of seven children born to Joseph and Sarah Poznanski, respected members of the Hebrew Congregation of Storchnest. Being from an Orthodox Jewish family, he received a traditional education as a shochet and a hazzan. Based on the extensive knowledge and skill he demonstrated in a variety of subject matter later in life, he was also likely exposed to other educational opportunities during his childhood. He left Poland in 1824 to go to Hamburg, which was a major center of the Jewish Reform Movement at the time.Solomon Breibart, Explorations in Charleston's Jewish History, The History Press, 2005, Volume 1, pp. 55-60 He spent time in Hamburg and later in Bremen learning about Reform before emigrating to the United States in 1831. A contemporary of Poznanski wrote that he \\"came from Bremen and Hamburg a scholar and endowed with extraordinary musical talent.\\" =Career= After arriving in the United States, he began serving as a shochet and the assistant hazzan at the Congregation Shearith Israel in New York City in 1832. In 1836, he was approached by members of Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina, when a vacancy in the position of hazzan, or minister, had opened up. The congregation was firmly traditionalist but was wary of those in favor of reform ‚Äì a group of reformers called \\"The Reformed Society of Israelites,\\" had split off from Congregation Beth Elohim in 1824 but had disbanded in 1833. Thus, the congregation was looking for a minister \\"who would faithfully execute his duties, according to those Rabbinical and Mosaical laws which were deemed vital to the existence of the Congregation, and who would also oppose innovation and change.\\" Isaac Leeser, one of the most prominent Orthodox Jewish leaders in America at the time, among others, recommended Poznanski for this role. Upon meeting with him, the leaders of the Congregation were satisfied and immediately elected him minister. Poznanski came to Charleston and so impressed the congregation and its traditional leaders through his gracious attitude and his skill in clerical duties that after just one year, he was elected minister for life even before his initial two-year contract was over. In April 1838, the synagogue of Beth Elohim burned down in a fire. The construction of a new synagogue, built in the Greek Revival style, was completed in 1840. Around this time, perhaps influenced by his time spent in Germany, Poznanski began to show signs of support for reform. He was in favor of adding instrumental music to service and suggested building a new organ in the new synagogue building.David B. Green, This Day in Jewish History / Shul rebels found Reform Judaism in U.S., Haaretz, November 21, 2013 Some progressive members of the congregation, backed by Poznanski, submitted a petition for the creation of an organ to the Board of Trustees. The idea was rejected by the traditionalist leaders as conflicting with the congregation's constitution, but a close, hotly contested congregational vote decided in favor of the petition and the organ was built. As a result, many of the traditionalist members of the congregation left Beth Elohim and created a new congregation, Shearith Israel, whose synagogue was located only a few blocks away from Beth Elohim's. Poznanski became the rabbi of the newly constructed Beth Elohim synagogue and the reformers gained control over the congregation and the Board of Trustees of Beth Elohim. At the dedication of the new synagogue building in 1841, Poznanski famously said, \\"This synagogue is our temple, this city our Jerusalem, this happy land our Palestine, and as our fathers defended with their lives that temple, that city and that land, so will their sons defend this temple, this city and this land.\\"Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim: History He added, \\"America is our Zion and Washington our Jerusalem.\\"A Portion of the People: Three Hundred Years of Jewish Southern Life: This Happy Land , Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, June 21, 2006 After gaining control, Poznanski and the Reformers began to suggest more reforms such as the removal of the twelfth principle regarding the belief in the coming of the Messiah from Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith as well as the removal of some traditional prayers and hymns from service. In response, some of the more traditionalist members, as well as some moderates who had supported the initiative for the organ but feared further reform, began to oppose the efforts of Poznanski and the reformers. The conflict between the Traditionalist and Reform groups came to a head when the Traditionalist group filed a lawsuit against the Reform group shortly after Poznanski had given a sermon suggesting ending the observance of the second days of Passover, on the first day of Passover in 1843. The South Carolina Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Reform position in 1846, allowing Poznanski to continue his reforms. Further reforms implemented by Poznanski as minister included carrying out services in English rather than Hebrew, implementing a three-year reading cycle of the Torah, the removal of the reading of the Haftarah, and the recital of only one kaddish during funerals. Upon being asked when would these changes would end, Poznanski replied \\"that he knew no stopping place to Reform in this enlightened age.\\" Despite his victory in court, Pozanski faced heavy criticism from Traditionalists in Charleston as well as in other places in the United States and there remained much bitterness between the two groups. He offered to resign as minister in 1847, with the hope that a new minister could ease tensions and unify the community. The Board of Trustees opposed his decision to resign immediately, but allowed him to lead a search committee to look for a successor. In 1850, a successor was found and Poznanski officially resigned. However, none of the successors of Poznanski were very successful in achieving unity in the Beth Elohim congregation until the reunification of Shearith Israel with Beth Elohim in 1866. =Personal life= He married Esther G. (Hetty) Barrett, the daughter of Isaac Barrett, the former President of the Hebrew Benevolent Society and Rachel Barrett.

He appeared in the animated features Frozen (2013) and Frozen II (2019), and the animated short films Frozen Fever (2015) and Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017). He is voiced primarily by Jonathan Groff. Kristoff is a S√°mi iceman who lives together with his reindeer companion Sven. Albeit preferring a solitary life, he helps Princess Anna of Arendelle to find her older sister Elsa in the North Mountain. Development =Origins and conception= In the early development, Kristoff was originally Kai as in Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Snow Queen\\", but later he was designed as combination of Kai and the robber girl. =Voice= He is primarily voiced by Jonathan Groff, while he's voiced as a child by Tyree Brown. =Physical appearance= Kristoff is tall, rugged, handsome, and in his early twenties. His build is a distinct variation on most Disney heroes. He has broad shoulders, large hands and feet, and a muscular build. He is significantly larger than Princess Anna. His build is a realistic consequence of his rough life as a mountain-dwelling ice harvester. Appearance =Frozen= Kristoff is the first major character to appear in the movie, and is introduced in \\"Frozen Heart\\", as an eight-year-old orphan boy with his baby reindeer, Sven, who becomes his best friend. He attempts to mimic the elder ice harvesters, with mixed success. Later that night, Sven is pulling him through the woods when the two horses belonging to the royal family of Arendelle ride past him at speed while transporting Anna to the trolls. Kristoff becomes intrigued as one of them is leaving behind a trail of ice (as that horse is carrying a distraught Elsa). From a distance, Kristoff watches as Pabbie, leader of the trolls, heals Anna's head. At the same time, one of the female trolls Bulda adopts Kristoff as her own child. 13 years later, Kristoff is a seasoned ice harvester by trade who lives in the mountains near Arendelle. He is briefly seen in Arendelle selling ice while the camera tracks through Arendelle prior to Elsa's coronation. A few days after Elsa's eternal winter begins, Anna shows up at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna in search of winter clothing. Kristoff arrives at the same time as her, covered in snow, seeking to purchase carrots for Sven and climbing rope. From Kristoff's exchange with Oaken, Anna hears that the blizzard in Arendelle comes from the North Mountain and assumes that is where Elsa is hiding. However, Kristoff is thrown out of the store for calling Oaken a crook. Seeing that Kristoff has a sled, Anna buys all of his items and urges him to take her to the North Mountain. Kristoff is reluctant to help her at first but eventually gives in. As Anna and Kristoff head for the North Mountain, Kristoff is incredulous learning about her whirlwind engagement to Hans. The conversation is cut short when their sled is attacked by hungry wolves. Although Anna, Kristoff and Sven escape by jumping over a chasm, the sled falls to the bottom of the ravine and explodes (much to Kristoff's sadness and dismay, as he just paid it off). He questions whether or not to continue helping Anna, agreeing once Anna promises to have his sled replaced. The next day, they meet Olaf, an anthropomorphic snowman unknowingly created by Elsa, who leads them the rest of the way to Elsa's ice castle. Kristoff waits outside while Anna tries to persuade Elsa to go back to Arendelle in order to put an end to the winter inadvertently created by Elsa but fails, and accidentally gets hit in the heart. Kristoff manages to rush Anna to Pabbie, but Pabbie says only \\"an act of true love\\" can save her. Thinking it is a \\"true love's kiss\\" from Hans, they head back to Arendelle. At the castle gate, he sadly hands Anna over to Hans. On the way back into the mountains, Sven attempts to push him back to Arendelle, but he refuses, thinking it is selfish to fulfill his love instead of letting Anna be saved by Hans. However, a giant snowstorm appears over Arendelle, prompting him to return. There he eventually finds Anna, but then he has to watch Anna freeze solid as she chooses to sacrifice herself, saving Elsa from being killed by Hans. Moments later Anna revives, as self-sacrifice counts as \\"an act of true love\\" which he is overjoyed by. In the end, he gets a new sled from Anna, and the two share a kiss. =Frozen Fever= In the short film Frozen Fever, Kristoff helps Elsa plan a surprise birthday party for Anna. While taking Anna on a birthday treasure hunt throughout the kingdom, Elsa comes down with a cold and unknowingly creates little snowmen called \\"snowgies\\" with each sneeze, which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf. Kristoff and Olaf later take the snowgies up to Elsa's ice palace to live with Marshmallow. =Olaf's Frozen Adventure= Kristoff appeared in a 21-minute holiday film along with Anna, Elsa, Olaf, and Sven, which debuted in theaters for a limited time engagement with Disney¬∑Pixar's Coco on November 22, 2017. It made its television debut on ABC on December 14, 2017. Like the rest of Arendelle (save for the royal family), it is revealed that Kristoff has his own holiday tradition, this being an annual celebration honoring Flemmingrad, a jolly fungus troll that was tragically killed by humans. =Frozen II= In the 2019 movie, Kristoff plans on proposing to Anna but is always too scared to ask her, but when Kristoff almost proposes, Anna is too distracted in finding and helping Elsa. During a ride on the sled, Kristoff tries to propose to Anna again when Elsa and Olaf are asleep but his plan backfires when he tries to explain their relationship. However, once Anna is reunited with Elsa and Olaf is brought back, Kristoff finally works up the courage to ask Anna to marry him in a simpler way than previous attempts and she happily accepts. =Disney theme parks= From July 5 to September 1, 2014, as part of 'Frozen' Summer Fun show at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Anna and Elsa appeared in a horse-drawn sleigh making their way down Hollywood Boulevard, alongside Kristoff and skaters, skiers and ice cutters in the Anna and Elsa's Royal Welcome section. The sisters will also make appearances in For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration, where they are joined by royal historians to retell the history of Arendelle; and \\"Frozen\\" Fireworks Spectacular alongside Kristoff and Olaf, a fireworks display set to the music of Frozen. Officially starting January 7, 2014, Kristoff began making appearances alongside Anna and Elsa at Disney California Adventure in \\"For the First Time in Forever ‚Äì A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration\\" in Hollywood Land as part of the park's \\"Frozen Fun\\" event. Reception Collider writer Matt Goldberg commented that Kristoff was \\"slightly less interesting than his love-interest (Anna)\\", but the cuteness of Anna and Kristoff‚Äôs relationship compensates the defect.

From 1920 until her death Leslie was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Biography Leslie was born to Frederick Leslie, a coal miner and bookseller, and Elizabeth Dickinson. She was educated in Leeds, graduating from a high school in 1905. She received her BSc in chemistry with first-class honors from the University of Leeds in 1908.The following year, she was awarded an M.Sc. for research with H.M.Dawson on the kinetics of the iodination of acetone. In that same she worked as a research assistant to Marie Curie in Paris (1909‚Äì1911) and wrote several articles in French on extraction of new elements from thorium and their properties. Upon recommendation from Curie, she then moved to Manchester to work on the properties of thorium and actinium with Ernest Rutherford at the Physical Laboratory of the Victoria University, Manchester. (1911‚Äì1912). After leaving Manchester she worked as a high school teacher in West Hartlepool (1912‚Äì1913) and as an assistant lecturer and demonstrator in chemistry at the University College in Bangor, Wales (1914‚Äì1915). During World War I Leslie worked on large-scale manufacture of explosives in Liverpool. Women were held in low esteem in science and engineering in those years. Thus both her Bangor and Liverpool appointments were unusual and could be explained by the shortage of men during the war. She had lost her job in explosives research in 1917 upon return of male engineers from the front. In 1918 Leslie was awarded a doctoral degree by the University of Leeds for her combined work on thorium and explosives. The same year she became a demonstrator in chemistry at Leeds and in 1928 a full lecturer in physical chemistry. During those years her research mostly focused on the chemistry of synthetic dyes. Back in 1920 she became Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. In 1923 Leslie married Alfred Hamilton Burr, a chemist at Salford. In 1929 she left Leeds to stay with her husband and returned to Leeds only after his death in 1933. She died four years later on 3 July 1937.

The winner is the panelists with the most cheese stuck to them. 1 point is awarded to the winning team. * Coming Down Your Chimney: A Christmas game where the audience is asked a \\"who's most likely to\\" question, with the answers being one of the panellists. The panellists then have to go into the chimney which they believe the audience answered. If they get it correct, they get a point for their team. If they're wrong, a 'festive treat' will go down the chimney and cover them. Examples of 'festive treats' include bread sauce, gravy, cranberry sauce and Christmas sick. * Conchita Fudge: The panelists are shown pictures of female celebrities who have been combined with the beard of a male celebrity. The teams have to identify both celebrities in the picture, and 1 point is awarded for each correct answer. * Cover Stories: The team captains choose one of a number of categories on the face of a giant magazine. A celebrity guests pops out and reads the name of the category. Each category refers to a different game that the contestants and their captains must play. Each of the games has a different scoring breakdowns. One of the main mini-games from the Cover Stories round is 'Doggystyle', in which bulldog Spud (formerly Gary, until 2011) dresses as a famous celebrity, and the panellists have to guess what celebrity he is dressed as. =D= * D'Camping Races: Made in honour of Gino \\"Sheffield\\" D'Acampo, the panelists are placed inside blown up tents and have to race to the centre of the studio to retrieve an award. The winning team is the team which retrieves the award first. * Don't Show Keith Your Teeth: All panellists take it in turns to say something relating to a chosen category without showing their teeth. If they show their teeth or hesitate they are out. The team with the remaining contestant on wins the round. * Ding-a-Ling-a-Dong-a-Long-a-Thon: Introduced in season 17, male contestants have a metal pole attached to them and attempt to strike a head height bar by thrusting up and down. They have 30 seconds to get as many hits as possible. =G= * G'Day Down Under: Usually played in the presence of Peter Andre, the panelists are turned upside down inside a mock studio set and have to attempt to create a form of foodstuff such as a burger or pizza whilst upside down. The winner is the person who collects the most amount of ingredients required. 1 point is awarded to the winner. =H= * Helicopter Head: First played in the fourteenth series, a panellist places their head in a stocking, which also has an orange stuffed in it. They then must use their head to knock off items relating to the panellist from podiums using only their heads, spinning it on a circular motion. There is one podium extremely high up that if the panellist knocks the item off it, they will win 2 points and a star prize, which is an old car. =I= * In Your Face: A panelists' head is grafted onto the body of another celebrity using CGI, and the panelists have to give their teammate clues as to the celebrity's identity.

For example, if you were given Russell Brand and Harry Styles, the link would Katy Perry, John Mayer and Taylor Swift. =L= * Lemon Head: The opening round of the show. In this round, a graphic of Keith's face appears on screen, split into sectors, each detailing a different clue which provides the basis for a question. Each of the team captains much choose a sector, and answer the question based on the clue given. Correct answers are each worth 1 point. The consensus of actually picking a question from the number of categories given is flawed; 80% of all questions are based on the 'prop' topic, with some props having been prepared before the team captains have started playing the game. Lemon is sometimes used as a human prop, wearing costumes or items of clothing. =M= * Man in the Mirror: Lemon acts out a particular task/activity and the panelists have to mirror it, albeit with more difficult apparatus/equipment making the task much harder. If they manage to complete the task they are awarded 1 point. * The Mask of Sorrow: The panellists are asked to wear a plastic mask which Lemon controls. With the help of the panellist, Lemon will give impressions of celebrities, and the other team have to guess who he is trying to impersonate. He often uses different colour masks for different celebrities depending on ethnicity, to make them easier to identify. * The Million Point Drop: A spoof of Channel 4 game show The Million Pound Drop, in which the panelists have to bet stakes on multiple choice answers to a quiz question. However, this time, no money is involved and the heads of the opposing team are inside the boxes where the stakes are dropped. The stakes are different types of gunge, such as Curry. The winning team is awarded 1 point. =N= * Name it on the Boogie: The panellists stand on a dancefloor, where Lemon has set himself up as the resident DJ. One member of each team will wear sound-cancelling headphones, whilst the others perform to songs being played.

Each correct answer is worth 1 point. =S= * Shouting One Out: The panellists are placed in the toilet stalls of a fictional nightclub, Vodka Fog, and are wearing sound-cancelling headphones. Lemon will read a slice of gossip from the stall wall and pass it through a peep hole via lip-reading. The panellists must pass it on to each other, if they read the gossip correctly from end to end they will receive 1 point. * Spot the Golden Potato: One team of panellists are given the chance to rearrange the studio while the lights are out, and hide a golden potato somewhere within the studio. The other team must identify the changes made, for each they receive 1 point, as well as an extra 5 points if they are able to locate the golden potato. As a trick, the potato is often somewhere out of the studio, such as 'at the bingo' or 'down the pub', however in the most recent game, it was hidden amongst a crate of 3,000 regular potatoes. =T= * The Trainee: A parody of The Apprentice, in which Lemon impersonates Alan Sugar, Willoughby parodies Karren Brady and Cotton parodies Nick Hewer. A panellist will be given the title of a product and a key word: they must then say that key word as many times as they can without the opposing team captain guessing what it is. If they succeed, they get earn as many points as the times they said the word. =W= * Who Are You Kidding?: The panellists are given pictures of various celebrities when they are children, and are asked to identify as many as possible. The team who bids the highest is given the chance to guess as many celebrities as they can, if they achieve their bid they receive 1 point, if they do not, the point goes to the other team. * Where's Holly?: The panelists are shown a picture which contains several tiny images of celebrities on it. The teams have to bid for how many celebrities they can identify. The winning team is the one who can identify the most celebrities. The winning team receives 1 point, and a bonus 2 points if they are able to identify where Holly is. =V= * The VT Round: A VT round that focuses on the outcome of a challenge between Keith and a celebrity guest or animal. A VT - videotape - is shown featuring the challenge. The team captains must guest who the winner of the challenge is. The correct answer is worth 1 point. A number of various formats of the round have been played, including: # Keith vs. Jedward; in which Keith takes on Irish twins Jedward in a variety of challenges. Formats have included 'Keith vs. Jedward: Around the World'; 'Keith vs. Jedward: At the Games' and 'Keith vs. Jedward: At the Movies'. # Keith vs. The Hoff; in which Keith takes on American actor and presenter David Hasselhoff in a number of challenges. # Keith vs. Verne; in which Keith takes on American actor Verne Troyer in a number of challenges. A variation of this format, 'Is Verne Bigger Than?', was played briefly in Series 3; the team captains had to guess if Verne was taller or smaller than a said object. # Keith vs. Corrie; in which Keith takes on the cast of Coronation Street in a number of Corrie-themed challenges. Actors who took part included Simon Gregson, Michael Le Vell and Jack P. Shepherd. # Keith vs. Rylan; in which Keith takes on former X Factor alumni Rylan Clark in a number of challenges. # Keith vs. Daytime; in which Keith takes on a number of famous alumni from ITV daytime programme in various challenges. # Keith vs. Beast; in which Keith takes on an animal or animals in a number of challenges, in which usually he has no chance of winning.

According to the official project plan, the first stage of the development cost US$35,340,000 (¬£21 million; ‚Ç¨25.5 million) and included construction of a luxury hotel, ice rink, swimming pool and restaurants. Official revenue forecasts suggest that 5,000 people will visit each day, generating an estimated annual income of $18,750,000 (¬£11.1 million; ‚Ç¨13.5 million). The Masikryong (literally, \\"horse- resting pass\\") project was initiated by the North Korean government as part of a drive to \\"make people not only possess strong physiques and sound mentality, but also enjoy their sports and cultural lives in a world‚Äôs advanced condition.\\" Despite political tensions with neighbouring South Korea, leaders in the North hoped to host some events at the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in Pyeongchang. Constructed in just ten months, North Korea's only ski resort was part of a drive by leader Kim Jong-un to increase foreign tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016.  Local environment  The limestone and gneiss Masikryong range runs from Chorwon County in the southwest to the northeast corner of Kangwon Province with average heights of . A gentle slope on the western side of the ridge contrasts with a sharp descent to the east. The area is home to a wide variety of deciduous trees including oak and lime. Average annual temperatures are with an average of in January and in July. It snows on the ridge from mid-November until early April.  Facilities  The hotel at the Masikryong Ski Resort. Along with nine beginner to intermediate level pistes, the site includes a ski school and kindergarten as well as a children's snow park. The on-resort Masikryong Hotel has a swimming pool and sauna, massage room, beauty parlour, billiards room, restaurants and an ice-skating rink. Designed by the Pyongyang Architectural Institute, the 120-room hotel has twin pyramidal towers with the taller of the two having nine floors. Conversion of the Kalma airforce base in nearby Wonsan into an international airport is underway as part of plans to create a special tourism area with the Masikryong resort as a major attraction.  Cultural impact  Soldiers of the Korean People‚Äôs Army constructed the resort in only ten months, giving rise to the new slogan \\"Masikryong speed\\", which has become a symbol of national pride as well as a propaganda device. The Daily Telegraph observed that \\"Masikryong speed\\" is a throwback to the Stakhanovite Chollima Movement introduced by former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung following the Korean War (19501953).  Controversy  A US$7.5 million (¬£4.5 million; ‚Ç¨5.5 million) deal with a Swiss ski-lift manufacturer was blocked in August 2013 after the country's government issued a directive based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094, itself a response to North Korea‚Äôs January 2013 nuclear test, that prohibited export sales of ‚Äúinstallations for infrastructure and equipment for sports facilities with a luxury character.‚Äù A spokesperson from Switzerland‚Äôs State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) described the resort as a ‚Äúprestigious propaganda project for the [North Korean] regime.‚Äù The Korean Central News Agency responded with a statement saying: \\"This is an intolerable mockery of the social system and the people of the DPRK and a serious human rights abuse that politicizes sports and discriminates against the Koreans.\\" The resort opened the same year, featuring a 30-year-old Austrian-made gondola lift, retired from Ischgl, that China supplied to North Korea. China's interpretation of the international sanctions excludes ski resorts from the banned \\"luxury\\" category.

He made several other advances in geriatric care, including the U.S. Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which established basic rights for nursing home residents. Katz received several public and private awards, including the Maxwell A. Pollak Award (1993) and the American Geriatrics Society‚Äôs (AGS) Foundation for Health in Aging (2001). The AGS award was also won by former US President Jimmy Carter and poet Maya Angelou. Katz held several academic positions, including Professor Emeritus of Geriatric Medicine at Columbia University, and distinguished scholar at the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging. He was a lifetime member of the National Academy of Sciences‚Äô Institute of Medicine (IoM), serving as the head of IoM‚Äôs Committee on Nursing Home Regulation from 1983 to 1985. During his time leading the committee, Katz initiated a review of current nursing home conditions; the committee developed a report that recommended an extensive redesign of nursing home policies, regulations, and standards. These recommendations were adopted into Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87), commonly known as the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which mandated standardized nursing home patient rights and enforced new regulatory requirements to ensure equal treatment of nursing home residents. Katz worked until the age of 87, retiring in 2011. He died at home on May 4, 2012. Biography and medical career Sidney Katz was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1924. His father owned a dry goods shop, and his mother ran the household and kept the books for the business. Katz credits his mother for encouraging his education and his medical career. After high school, Katz was unable to study for a medical degree due to the onset of World War II. He volunteered for the US Navy in 1942, at the age of 18, and was assigned to various medical details including running the health services department at Purdue University for enlisted men. During his service, Katz was eventually promoted to become a functioning specialist in nursing surgery. While at Purdue University, he became interested in virology, and was accepted into medical school at Western Reserve Medical School (now Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine). He remained there after his service, and continued to research in virology. Upon graduation in 1948, he received a fellowship from the American Cancer Society. Shortly afterwards Katz volunteered to serve in the Army during the Korean War. During this service he was responsible for a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit with two other physicians. One of the main goals of this unit was to fight the growing hemorrhagic fever epidemic that had infected 1,000 men, killing 10%. Katz and his colleagues were the first physicians to truly describe both the disease and the effectiveness of known cures. The cures that seemed to be most effective were compiled into a protocol that was used to standardize treatment of the disease. Through this work, Katz lowered the mortality rate of the disease from 10% to 1%. After leaving the Army, Katz joined the Benjamin Rose Rehabilitation HospitalBenjamin Rose Rehabilitation Hospital in Cleveland, to study the effect of vitamins on elderly patients. Index of Independence of Activities for Daily Living As Katz began to understand more about the medicine sub-specialty of long-term care for elderly adults, his team at Benjamin Rose began to gather data on how different treatments affected patient outcomes. Katz‚Äôs first attempt at formally capturing this data was to study 64 hip fracture patients during an 18-month period. Comprehensive data on treatments, patient progression, and outcomes were collected during this study. After analyzing the study data, the researchers discovered that patients that were most independent could all perform a set of basic activities, ranging from the most complex bathing activity to the least complex feeding activity. From this data, Katz developed a scale to score a patient's ability to live independently. This scale was called the index of activities for daily living, and was first published in the 1963 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA); it had been cited more than 46,000 times by 2012. Katz and his team at Benjamin Rose Rehabilitation Hospital spent the next ten years revising the scale, including a more, diverse patient population. Advisory service While still working on developing the ADL scale, Katz became involved in the national healthcare community. In 1965 he became an active member of the working groups of the National Center for Health Services Research. In 1978 he was appointed to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IoM). In 1977 and 1978 Katz sat on the Long-Term care Technical Advisory Panel of the National Center for Health Statistics, where he first introduced the Minimum Basic Data Set for Long-Term Care. In 1981 he was appointed as a Special Advisor to the White House Conference on Aging, and a Senior Advisor to the United States Preventive Services Task Force. In 1983 Katz was appointed for two years to lead IoM's Committee on Nursing Home Regulation. He facilitated a comprehensive review of current practice and care guidelines to base the committee's recommendations on science as far as possible. Katz's committee recommended sweeping changes to the standard of care, audit procedures, and better enforcement of quality assurance practices by both nursing home facilities and oversight organizations. The IoM committee recommendations were incorporated into OBRA-87 legislation, which was signed into law in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. Katz's recommendations also paved the way towards the 1991 mandate, as part of the Minimum Data Set legislation, that requires nursing homes to complete the national resident assessment system to ensure quality of life for residents. Katz became a lifetime member of the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. He advised several legislators, the Department of Health and Human Services, and non-profit organizations on healthcare issues. He also provided international consultation for the United Nations and for several countries including Sweden, France, and the United Kingdom.

The work took him more than twenty years to finish. His commentaries of the Analects of Confucius and the Mencius are also highly influential. Early life and education Yang Bojun was born in September 1909 in Changsha, Hunan province. He was the eldest son of Yang Shugu (), and was also known as Yang Dechong (). Starting in childhood, he was taught by his grandfather to read Confucian classics such as the Analects, the Book of Poetry, and the Zuo Zhuan. In 1926, he passed the examination to enter the Chinese department of Peking University, where he studied under prominent scholars such as Qian Xuantong, Chen Yuan, and the philologist Huang Kan. He graduated in 1932. However, the person who influenced him the most was his uncle Yang Shuda (Êù®Ê†ëËææ), also a well-known philologist. Career In 1953, Yang became an associate professor at the Chinese department of Peking University. He began writing Lunyu Yizhu (ËÆ∫ËØ≠ËØëÊ≥®, \\"Translation and Annotation of the Analects\\"), which was published in 1958 by Zhonghua Book Company. When the Anti-Rightist Movement began in 1957, Yang and three of his cousins (sons of Yang Shuda) were labelled \\"Rightists\\". Yang was transferred to Lanzhou University in remote Gansu province, where he continued to teach in the Chinese department. In Lanzhou he wrote Mengzi Yizhu (Â≠üÂ≠êËØëÊ≥®, \\"Translation and Annotation of the Mencius\\"), which was published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1960. In 1960 he moved back to Beijing to work for Zhonghua Book Company, where he edited the Book of Jin, and began working on Chunqiu Zuozhuan Zhu (Annotated Zuo Zhuan). Zuo Zhuan was the most monumental work of the Thirteen Classics, comprising almost 200,000 characters of Old Chinese. For the annotation Yang studied many related works including the Shiji, Gongyang Zhuan, and Guliang Zhuan. He also consulted older commentaries and notes on the Zuo Zhuan by scholars such as Hong Liangji, Liu Wenqi (ÂäâÊñáÊ∑á), Liu Shipei, and Zhang Binglin, as well as oracle bone records and bronze inscriptions. Many of his notes were destroyed during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76), which he only partially recovered from memory. The book was finally published in 1981, more than 20 years after he started the work. A revised edition was published in 1990. In 1985, the Zuo Zhuan Dictionary, compiled by Yang and his wife Xu Ti (), was published.

He became a minister in the Church of England. Alongside Elieser Bassin, he was also one of the first proponents of British Israelism to be of Jewish descent. He published History of the Jews in Great Britain (1851) and Vestiges of the Historic Anglo-Hebrews in East Anglia (1870). His nephew was David Samuel Margoliouth. Life He was born of Jewish parents at Suwa≈Çki, Poland, on 3 December 1820. He was instructed at Pryerosl, Grodno, and Kalwarya in talmudic and rabbinical learning, and also acquired Russian and German. In August 1837, during a visit to Liverpool, he was induced to carefully study the Hebrew New Testament, with the result that on 13 April 1838 he was baptised a member of the Church of England. For a time he obtained a livelihood by giving lessons in Hebrew, but in January 1840 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, to prepare for ordination, and during the vacations studied at the Hebrew College, London. In 1843, he became instructor of Hebrew, German, and English at the Liverpool Institution for Inquiring Jews. On 30 June 1844, he was ordained to the curacy of St. Augustine, Liverpool. Three months later, the Bishop of Kildare obtained for him the incumbency of Glasnevin, near Dublin, and made him his examining chaplain. The parish being small, Margoliouth had much leisure for literary pursuits. He started a Hebrew Christian monthly magazine, entitled The Star of Jacob, which extended to six numbers (January‚ÄìJune 1847), and tried to establish a Philo-Hebraic Society for promoting the study of Hebrew literature, and for reprinting scarce Hebrew works. He subsequently served curacies at Tranmere, Cheshire; St. Bartholomew, Salford; Wybunbury, Cheshire (1853-5); St. Paul, Haggerston, London; Wyton, Huntingdonshire; and St. Paul, Onslow Square, London. In 1857, he accepted the Ph.D. degree of Erlangen. Among his own people he was an indefatigable worker. In 1847, he visited the Holy Land, and on his return published an interesting account of his wanderings. During his travels he made the acquaintance of many celebrated men, among whom were August Neander, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti. In 1877, he was presented to the vicarage of Little Linford, Buckinghamshire. He died in London on 25 February 1881, and was buried in Little Linford churchyard.

Between 2013 and 2015 he was Head of Cabinet of the President of the European Economic and Social Committee, Henri Malosse. He is professor 'corporate finance' at the Universities of Ghent and Nancy. He was among the first to openly oppose separatist tensions in Belgium and fought against corruption in both the north and the south of the country. He is also the only person to serve as Head of Cabinet at the European, Belgian, Walloon and Flemish levels. He has received several awards, including one for political courage, one for the architect of the best European regional entrepreneurship plan and the prestigious award for democracy Aron-Condorcet.  Professional career  Holding a master's degree in economics from KU Leuven, European economics from the College of Europe and philosophy from KU Leuven, Rudy Aernoudt began his career as an official in the European Commission. He was mainly responsible for programs for access to finance. He has written several books and articles on corruption, its nature, its consequences and how to tackle and prevent it. In 2012 he published a novel (De Duivelszak) about it. He is one of the few Belgians to make a career on both sides of the linguistic border being alternately Deputy Head of Cabinet of , MR Walloon Minister (Francophone liberal right) in 2001-2003 and then Head of Cabinet of Fientje Moerman, OpenVLD federal-level and then Flemish Minister (Dutch-speaking liberal right) in 2003-2006. He writes, following this experience and due to his convictions, the book which will make him known to the general public \\"Wallonia - Flanders, I love you, me neither\\" published in 2006. In it, he seeks to dispel the different Flemish clich√©s on Wallonia and to demonstrate the relevance of the unity of Belgium. This book is also a response to the Warande manifesto, a publication by a group of Flemish businessmen and academics, aiming to demonstrate the relevance of Flemish independence from an economic point of view. The same year as he became Secretary-General of the Flemish administration, following his departure from office and his appointment, he denounced embezzlement within his own cabinet with the Minister Fientje Moerman, who was forced to resign. Rudy Aernoudt followed up on this momentum by publishing the following year \\"Brussels, the unloved child\\" which insists on the advantages that Brussels offers to Belgium, deemed underexploited. 2007 witnessed the EU crisis and the electoral victory of the cartel CD&V;/NVA whose visions of the future of the country radically opposed to those of Rudy Aernoudt. He was thus abruptly let go following an interview published in Le Soir where he questioned the legitimacy of Yves Leterme to lead a reform of the state at the expense of the federal government. The Flemish Government stated that \\"any collaboration had become impossible\\". Rudy Aernoudt presented his version of events in \\"Adventures of a 'cabinettard'\\" and, after losing the first trial, gets the conviction of the Flemish government.  Academic career  He is since the age of 28 professor corporate finance and European enterprise policy at the University of Ghent, department of economics and teaches as well at the University of Nancy (Master in European economics). From 2007 to 2010 he was also a lecturer at the University of Li√®ge of a course in Dutch entitled \\"Introduction to good governance\\" (Inleiding tot goed bestuur), whose neutrality was questioned by the Belgian Movement of Young Socialists.\\"La Libre Belgique: Le cours donn√© par Rudy Aernoudt √† l'Ulg est-il neutre ?\\", RTBF and \\"Aernoudt enseigne √† l‚ÄôULg ¬´ comment l‚Äô√âtat gaspille votre argent ¬ª\\", Le Soir, 2010-06-24 He was a guest professor at the Technical University of Brno at the Czech Republic.

He thus became the only Belgian to have served as Head of Cabinet at the European, national (Belgian) and regional (Wallonia and Flanders) levels. According to the newspaper De Morgen, this fact deserves his nomination for the Guinness book of records. Based on his experience in the US, he conceived and launched an SBIC-inspired investment initiative at the Commission called ESCALAR, that supports venture capital and growth financing for promising companies, enabling them to scale up in Europe and help reinforce Europe's economic and technological sovereignty, FD Magazine, Scale-up initiative, November 2017 which he explained for instance at Euronews https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/24/what- challenges-are-entrepreneurs-faced-with-during-the-covid-19-pandemic  Political mood  Rudy Aernoudt in 2013 Rudy Aernoudt continued his political battle in 2008 by creating a bilingual movement, \\"Belgi√´ Anders/La Belgique Autrement\\" (Belgium differently), which organized a series of conferences. He teaches in different universities (Ghent, Brussels) and became director- general of OLPC, a spin-off from MIT. In 2008, he created the LiDE party, which he left in 2009 to become, in November 2009, Co-Chair of the Popular Party, another political party that has enjoyed rapid success but was a victim of internal tensions. He wanted to make an alliance with the MR but the FDF vetoed by threatening to leave the MR. Aernoudt is considered to be the architect of this separation. In 2009 he became co-chairman of the new People's Party. He was expelled from the party in late August 2010 after what appears to be an internal power struggle, an exclusion whose regularity he often denies while denouncing what he sees as a drift of the party. Modrikamen in turn was excluded in September 2010 by Aernoudt and co-disciples. Aernoudt was confirmed with an overwhelming majority of 28,000 votes but left active politics; at least in terms of political parties. For his political positions, Rudy Aernoudt has received several awards, among which the prestigious award of the French community Aron - Condorcet and the prize for political courage at Belgian level B+.

Leon who described it thought it was a new order that was intermediate between the flies and the bugs. It was misclassified and thought to be similar to aquatic bugs in the Hydrometridae and the hairy legs were considered as adaptations for swimming.

The implementation is named after Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the deprecated predecessor of TLS, for which support was removed in release 2.3.0. The OpenBSD project forked LibreSSL from OpenSSL 1.0.1g in April 2014 as a response to the Heartbleed security vulnerability, with the goals of modernizing the codebase, improving security, and applying development best practices.  History  After the Heartbleed security vulnerability was discovered in OpenSSL, the OpenBSD team audited the codebase and decided it was necessary to fork OpenSSL to remove dangerous code. The libressl.org domain was registered on 11 April 2014; the project announced the name on 22 April 2014. In the first week of development, more than 90,000 lines of C code were removed. Unused code was removed, and support for obsolete operating systems was removed. LibreSSL was initially developed as an intended replacement for OpenSSL in OpenBSD 5.6, and was ported to other platforms once a stripped-down version of the library was stable. , the project was seeking a \\"stable commitment\\" of external funding. On 17 May 2014, Bob Beck presented \\"LibreSSL: The First 30 Days, and What The Future Holds\\" during the 2014 BSDCan conference, in which he described the progress made in the first month. On 5 June 2014, several OpenSSL bugs became public. While several projects were notified in advance, LibreSSL was not; Theo de Raadt accused the OpenSSL developers of intentionally withholding this information from OpenBSD and LibreSSL. On 20 June 2014, Google created another fork of OpenSSL called BoringSSL, and promised to exchange fixes with LibreSSL. Google has already relicensed some of its contributions under the ISC license, as it was requested by the LibreSSL developers. On 21 June 2014, Theo de Raadt welcomed BoringSSL and outlined the plans for LibreSSL-portable. Starting on 8 July, code porting for macOS and Solaris began, while the initial porting to Linux began on 20 June. = Adoption = LibreSSL is the default provider of TLS for: * Dragonfly BSD * OpenBSD * OpenELEC * TrueOS packages * Void Linux * Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre LibreSSL is a selectable provider of TLS for: * FreeBSD packages * Gentoo packages * OPNsense packages  Changes  = Memory-related = Changes include replacement of custom memory calls to ones in a standard library (for example, \`strlcpy\`, \`calloc\`, \`asprintf\`, \`reallocarray\`, etc.). This process may help later on to catch buffer overflow errors with more advanced memory analysis tools or by observing program crashes (via ASLR, use of the NX bit, stack canaries, etc.). Fixes for potential double free scenarios have also been cited in the VCS commit logs (including explicit assignments of null pointer values). There have been extra sanity checks also cited in the commit logs related to ensuring length arguments, unsigned-to-signed variable assignments, pointer values, and method returns. = Proactive measures = In order to maintain good programming practice, a number of compiler options and flags designed for safety have been enabled by default to help in spotting potential issues so they can be fixed earlier (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, -Wuninitialized). There have also been code readability updates which help future contributors in verifying program correctness (KNF, white-space, line-wrapping, etc.). Modification or removal of unneeded method wrappers and macros also help with code readability and auditing (Error and I/O abstraction library references). Changes were made to ensure that LibreSSL will be year 2038 compatible along with maintaining portability for other similar platforms. In addition, \`explicit_bzero\` and \`bn_clear\` calls were added to prevent the compiler from optimizing them out and prevent attackers from reading previously allocated memory. = Cryptographic = There were changes to help ensure proper seeding of random number generator-based methods via replacements of insecure seeding practices (taking advantage of features offered by the kernel itself natively). In terms of notable additions made, OpenBSD has added support for newer and more reputable algorithms (ChaCha stream cipher and Poly1305 message authentication code) along with a safer set of elliptic curves (brainpool curves from RFC 5639, up to 512 bits in strength). = Added features = The initial release of LibreSSL added a number of features: the ChaCha and Poly1305 algorithm, the Brainpool and ANSSI elliptic curves, and the AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD modes. Later versions added the following: * 2.1.0: Automatic ephemeral EC keys * 2.1.2: Built-in arc4random implementation on macOS and FreeBSD * 2.1.2: Reworked GOST cipher suite support * 2.1.3: ALPN support * 2.1.3: SHA-256 Camellia cipher suites * 2.1.4: TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV server-side support * 2.1.4: certhash as a replacement of the c_rehash script * 2.1.4: X509_STORE_load_mem API for loading certificates from memory (enhance chroot support) * 2.1.4: Experimental Windows binaries * 2.1.5: Minor update mainly for improving Windows support, first working 32- and 64-bit binaries * 2.1.6: libtls declared stable and enabled by default * 2.2.0: AIX and Cygwin support * 2.2.1: Addition of EC_curve_nid2nist and EC_curve_nist2nid from OpenSSL, initial Windows XP/2003 support * 2.2.2: Defines LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER, added TLS_*methods as a replacement for the SSLv23_*method calls, cmake build support = Old insecure features = The initial release of LibreSSL disabled a number of features by default. Some of the code for these features was later removed, including Kerberos, US-Export ciphers, TLS compression, DTLS heartbeat, SSL v2 and SSL v3. Later versions disabled more features: * 2.1.1: Following the discovery of the POODLE vulnerability in the legacy SSL 3.0 protocol, LibreSSL now disables the use of SSL 3.0 by default. * 2.1.3: GOST R 34.10-94 signature authentication * 2.2.1: Removal of Dynamic Engine and MDC-2DES support * 2.2.2: Removal of SSL 3.0 from the openssl binary, removal of Internet Explorer 6 workarounds, RSAX engine. * 2.3.0: Complete removal of SSL 3.0, SHA-0 and DTLS1_BAD_VER = Code removal = The initial release of LibreSSL has removed a number of features that were deemed insecure, unnecessary or deprecated as part of OpenBSD 5.6. * In response to Heartbleed, the heartbeat functionality was one of the first features to be removed * Unneeded platforms (Classic Mac OS, NetWare, OS/2, VMS, 16-bit Windows, etc.) * Support for platforms that do not exist, such as big-endian i386 and amd64 * Support for old compilers * The IBM 4758, Broadcom ubsec, Sureware, Nuron, GOST, GMP, CSwift, CHIL, CAPI, Atalla and AEP engines were removed due to irrelevance of hardware or dependency on non-free libraries * The OpenSSL PRNG was removed (and replaced with ChaCha20-based implementation of arc4random) * Preprocessor macros that have been deemed unnecessary or insecure or had already been deprecated in OpenSSL for a long time (e.g. des_old.h) * Older unneeded files for assembly language, C, and Perl (e.g. EGD) * MD2, SEED functionality * SSL 3.0, SHA-0, DTLS1_BAD_VER The Dual EC DRBG algorithm, which is suspected of having a back door, was cut along with support for the FIPS 140-2 standard that required it. Unused protocols and insecure algorithms have also been removed, including the support for FIPS 140-2, MD4/MD5 J-PAKE, and SRP. = Bug backlog = One of the complaints of OpenSSL was the number of open bugs reported in the bug tracker that had gone unfixed for years.

She had two older brothers, Mark Sischy, a lawyer who lived in Scotland, and David Sischy, a doctor. Her family was Jewish; they had Lithuanian ancestry.Michael Wolff, \\"Fametown\\", New York Magazine, 23 October 2000. In 1961, when Sischy was nine years old, the Sischy family left apartheid-era South Africa after the Sharpeville massacre and moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dr. Sischy re-trained as a radiologist. The family had had to leave South Africa because Sischy's mother was in danger of being arrested for her involvement in an activist group, the Black Sash, that non- violently protested apartheid. In 1967, the family moved to Rochester, New York, where Sischy's father became the head of radiation oncology at Highland Hospital. While in Scotland, Sischy attended George Watson's Ladies College. In Rochester, she graduated from Brighton High School, where she was the president of the senior class. Sischy started college at Sarah Lawrence College during a time of great political unrest in the United States. It was there that she came out as a lesbian. She also took writing classes with Grace Paley. Sischy graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1973. She received an honorary PhD in the humanities from the Moore College of Art in 1987. Career After graduating from college, Sischy took a series of odd jobs and entry-level positions in the art world, including at galleries. She became the circulation coordinator at Print Collector's Newsletter, an art world industry resource, and was quickly promoted to the role of editor, contributing reviews of works she saw in the burgeoning New York City art world. She was hired, and almost immediately fired, by the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where the dress code and atmosphere made her feel untrue to herself. She then worked at Printed Matter, Inc, a nonprofit book publisher that introduced her to artists like Sol LeWitt, Jenny Holzer, and many up and coming artists. =Museum of Modern Art= In 1978, Sischy interned at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) under a National Endowment for the Arts curation grant, where she focused on curating photography exhibits, one called \\"In the Twenties: Portraits From the Photography Department\\", and another on photographer Ansel Adams. During this time, she was mentored by John Szarkowski. the Director of the Department of Photography at MoMA. =Artforum= In 1979, at the age of 27, Sischy was appointed editor-in-chief of Artforum magazine by businessman and publisher Anthony Korner and Amy Baker Sandback. Sischy immediately tapped into the vibrant downtown art scene and created innovative, avant-garde covers and highly stylized content, often written by artists, that created a new standard for art magazines. Over her eight-year editorship, Sischy transformed the once-esoteric Artforum into the so-called \\"art world bible\\" it is today. Sischy herself became known as a tastemaker and something of an icon, and was profiled at length by the critic and journalist Janet Malcolm in The New Yorker. =The New Yorker= She left Artforum in 1988 to become a consulting editor at The New Yorker and work on in-depth research on the AIDS virus, which had begun to decimate the downtown artist community. From 1988-96, she worked at The New Yorker, reporting on fashion and art. =Interview Magazine= In 1989, Sischy took over as editor of Interview, a downtown magazine founded by Andy Warhol in 1969. During her tenure at Interview, covers of the magazine became iconic, promoting artists, actors, and fashion icons from the art world. In 1996, she was named Artistic Director of the inaugural Florence Fashion Biennale, where she created an exhibition that showed work in 20+ museums in the Florence, Italy area. Part of this exhibition was later presented at the Guggenheim Museum Soho. In 2008, Sischy resigned from Interview Magazine amidst much press and speculation. =Vanity Fair= Sischy was a contributing editor to Vanity Fair from 1997 until her death in 2015. She was the international editor of Cond√© Nast, writing for the Spanish, French, and Italian versions of Vanity Fair, and the German and Russian versions of Vogue. She shared this position with her long-time partner and later wife, Sandra Brant. = Other activities = Sischy was a member of an all-female art band called Disband, founded in 1978 by artists and writers. She was featured in the 2011 documentary film !Women Art Revolution, where she discussed her contributions to the feminist movement of female artists in the 1970s. She was a widely published author on a range of cultural subjects. She contributed to a broad range of periodicals, including The New York Times and Vanity Fair and was at one time the fashion and photography critic for The New Yorker. In 2013, Sischy was given the \\"Fashion Scoop of the Year\\" Award (for her Vanity Fair piece on John Galliano) at the Fashion Media Awards by her friend, photographer Bruce Weber. Personal life Although she was in at least one long-term relationship with a woman from the time she was in college, it was a New Yorker review of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe photography show, \\"The Perfect Moment,\\" where Sischy came out publicly as a lesbian. Sischy described the chronic battles of her brother, Mark Sischy, with alcoholism in her interview with designer John Galliano, who was newly sober. In 2015, Sischy married her longtime partner of over 25 years, Sandra Brant (n√©e Simms). Brant was formerly married to Brant Publications' owner, Peter M. Brant, who was the publisher of Interview Magazine. Ingrid Sischy and Sandra Brant lived in Montauk, the farthest point east on the southern shores of Long Island, in a cottage designed by Stanford White, and in a town house in Greenwich Village. They were godmothers to Elton John and David Furnish's son. Death Sischy died on 24 July 2015 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from breast cancer at the age of 63.

It provides services to retail and institutional traders via the electronic trading platforms ActivTrader, MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5. The company's client base is primarily based in Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as well as in South America, the Middle East and South East Asia. History Founder and Chairman Alex Pusco established ActivTrades as a stockbrokerage in Switzerland in 2001 and moved to London in 2005. The Forex broker expanded its product range offering MetaTrader 4 in 2007 and adding CFDs on indices and commodities to its offer in 2008. ActivTrades expanded its presence in the UK, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and strengthened its position across Central Europe in 2012. The company also became a regular sponsor of the World of Trade Conference and has supported the conference for several years. The first independent World of Trading Awards occurred in Germany in 2013, for which ActivTrades was recognised for as the top Forex Broker in relation to the MetaTrader platform. In March 2012, the company offered MetaTrader 5 to its users and included financial spread betting to its portfolio for UK-based clients. In 2013, ActivTrades implemented its Negative Balance Protection Policy and a separate insurance protection as excess to the FSCS insurance. This policy is underwritten by QBE Underwriting Limited and other participating syndicates at Lloyd's of London. The launch of the Smart Tools, a series of add-ins for its trading platforms, followed later that year. In 2015, ActivTrades launched its own Prepaid Master Card. In 2016 the company launched its proprietary trading platform ActivTrader. In 2017, ActivTrades strengthened its client insurance protection to ¬£1.0 million, one of the highest in the industry. Operations ActivTrades is headquartered in London. The company employs more than 200 individuals, covering key areas of the business such as customer service (a multilingual team serving over 14 different languages), marketing, compliance, finance, risk management and IT among others. They operate three branches outside the UK ‚Äì in Milan, Sofia and the Bahamas. The Milan office was opened in 2011 to better support clients in this area. The company's larger branch in Sofia, Bulgaria, opened in 2012 and now employs more than 100 people and handles the programming and technical development aspects of the company. The remainder of ActivTrades‚Äô employees are in its UK headquarters. The Middle Eastern expansion has resulted in the organisation's recognition as the Best Retail FX Provider from the Investment Opportunities and Wealth Management Conference, as well as Fastest Growing FX Provider in the Middle East. =Platforms and mobile trading= ActivTrades offers MetaTrader 4 and 5, which are also available for mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad and Android. They also provide swap free accounts as well as access to the markets via ActivTrader, a web and mobile platform to buy and sell instruments on the go. = Cryptocurrencies = In December 2017, ActivTrades launched crypto CFDs in Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum for its clients. The offering of the three cryptocurrency pairs became available with a maximum trading leverage of 1:5, to ensure enough margin is allocated upfront in the event of the potentially strong movements cryptocurrencies tend to experience. Commenting on the news, CEO Pusco, said, \\"Now that leading derivatives marketplaces such as the CME and CBOE have started offering Futures contracts on Bitcoin there is more liquidity in the cryptocurrencies market and we can offer a higher quality product for our traders.\\" In January 2018, ActivTrades gave its customers access to Ripple after a December where it grew 1500% to become the third biggest cryptocurrency for market capitalisation after Bitcoin and Ethereum. = Exchange-traded funds = In 2018, the company launched exchange-traded funds as part of its offering, which can be used to track an index, commodity, bonds or a basket of assets like an index fund. This allows traders to balance the risk profile of an investment across an array of different companies in sectors such as finance, energy or healthcare, making them suitable to be traded in the long or short- term. = Regulation = The Company is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK and by CONSOB in Italy, and is also a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The firm was fined ¬£85,750 in 2011 for failure to segregate customer funds. Since, the broker has increased its client funds protection insurance from ¬£500,000 to ¬£1 million as excess of the FSCS threshold.

Traditional Bavarian Haferlschuhe with side laces, and soles fitted with staples and nails Size 180 shoe The German Shoe Museum (, full name: Museum f√ºr Schuhproduktion und Industriegeschichte Hauenstein) is a museum in Hauenstein, Palatinate. Its exhibits cover the development of the local shoe industry. On four stories of an old shoe factory, the museum illustrates both technical aspects of shoe manufacturing and the social and every day history of shoes.\\"Hauenstein: German shoe museum is a step into the past\\" Stars and Stripes. Retrieved 2014-7-21. The exhibition portrays the beginnings of the shoe industry in the nearby town of Pirmasens dating to around 1800, when discharged soldiers made shoes to earn a living. By the mid-19th century Pirmasens had developed into the most important site of the German shoe industry. This affected the little village of Hauenstein, which at the time consisted mainly of small farmers and forest workers. In 1886 the Seibel brothers founded the first shoe factory in Hauenstein.\\"Satisfy your shoe fetish with a trip to the German Shoe Museum\\" Kaiserslautern American. Retrieved 2014-7-21. By 1914, twenty factories had been established, with more than 1,000 employees. Despite the pressures to combine that arose from the French occupation, economic crises, and the war years, the number of factories had grown by 1960 to 35. Thereafter, however, progressive automation and the relocation of production to foreign countries led to a serious structural crisis in the German shoe industry, resulting in numerous businesses being closed. The German Shoe Museum is housed in one of these former production facilities.  Circular walk  A circular walk runs through the museum. The ground floor covers the early days of shoe manufacturing from 1740 to 1918, from steam engines to typical accommodations for the workers in a shoe factory. The top floor houses a collection of over 3,000 pairs of historic shoes owned by a shoe collector from Viersen, Ernst Tillmann. The presentation of period and social history on the second floor covers the years 1918 to 1945. Here there is a still fully working \\"modern\\" shoe factory, which is in operation daily. One floor lower, covering the time since 1945, the museum shows the impact of the Second World War on the shoe industry and types of shoes made. The visitor is led through a typical 1960s flat and can see, in a completely equipped shoe salon, how the fit of new shoes was tested with a fluoroscope using X-rays. Also on the first floor is the largest pair of shoes in the world: a size 248. At the conclusion of the circular walk, the shoes of several prominent people, such as Angela Merkel and Joschka Fischer are displayed.  Award  The German Shoe Museum in Hauenstein was awarded an \\"excellent\\" grade in the European Museum competition because, in the view of the assessment panel, it brings together well the presentation of shoe culture and social history.

Credit: Wellcome Collection Thomas Marryat M.D. (1730‚Äì1792) was an English physician, known also as a medical writer and wit. Life Born in London, he was the son of Zephaniah Marryat, a nonconformist minister, and was educated for the Presbyterian ministry. From 1747 until 1749 he belonged to a late-night poetical club. It met at the Robin Hood, Butcher Row, Strand, London, and among the members were Richard Brookes, Moses Browne, Stephen Duck, Martin Madan, and Thomas Madox; members brought a piece of poetry, which if approved might be sent to the Gentleman's Magazine and other periodicals. It was at this club that the plan and title of the Monthly Review, subsequently used by Ralph Griffiths, were brought up. Marryat gave up on the ministry, after a time at Southwold and Barnet, and left his family in 1760. He went to Edinburgh, where he was a medical student and graduated M.D. For a while he sought practice in London, but in 1762 made a tour of continental medical schools, and subsequently visited America, obtaining practice where he could. On his return in 1766 he resided for several years in Antrim and northern Ireland. In February 1774 Marryat moved to Shrewsbury, but finally settled in Bristol about 1785. Here he delivered a course of lectures on therapeutics which was well attended. He had some success in practice, which dropped off, and refused assistance from relations. Marryat died on 29 May 1792, and was buried in the ground belonging to the chapel in Lewin's Mead, in Brunswick Square, Bristol. His manners were blunt, but he was considered honest, and kind, especially to the poor. More orthodox physicians took him as an empiric. He prescribed enormous doses of drastic medicines to nonpaying patients, and, for dysentery, paper boiled in milk. The bookseller Henry Lemoine sold a \\"bug-water\\", to which Marryat lent his name. Works Marryat published: * Medical Aphorisms, or a Compendium of Physic, founded on irrefragible principles, Ipswich, 1756 or 1757, mostly retracted later. * Therapeutics, or a New Practice of Physic, which was \\"humbly inscribed to everybody\\". It was first published in Latin in 1758 and reprinted in Dublin in 1764; after which a publisher Dodd issued two spurious copies, one in Cork, dated 1770, and another in London in 1774. A fourth edition was issued at Shrewsbury, under Marryat's supervision, in 1775. A pocket edition, with the title of The Art of Healing, became popular, a twentieth impression having appeared at Bristol in 1805. Prefixed to it is a life of Marryat, with his portrait engraved by Johnson, and autograph. *The Philosophy of Masons, heterodox and offensive to friends. Marryat also wrote verse. A new edition of his Sentimental Fables for the Ladies, republished from an Irish copy, appeared at Bristol in 1791. It was dedicated to Hannah More, and sold well.

It would become the South African National Students Congress (SANSCO) in 1986, after adopting the Educational Charter and aligning itself officially with the Freedom Charter. This was to be merged in 1991 with the National Union of South African Students to form the South African Students Congress. History Following the banning of the South African Student Organisation (SASO), a new student‚Äôs structure was constituted to fill the void. The new structure, called the Azanian Student Organisation (AZASO), was established in 1979 by students from five black universities and one college of education. AZASO, which was formed under Tom Nkoane, though it initially emerged as a continuation of SASO, later manifested itself as a different organisation that adopted African National Congress (ANC) policies and the Freedom Charter over the Black Consciousness Doctrine. In addition, AZASO advocated a non-racial policy towards working with other youth organisations, while SASO's philosophy of Black Consciousness called for a total break away from White student structures and as such they did not co- operate with them. AZASO also secured political cooperation with other ANC- aligned formations such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress of South African Students (COSAS). All these developments highlighted a drift by AZASO from the philosophy of Black Consciousness and its associated organisations like SASO and the Black People's Convention (BPC).Black Student Politics, Higher Education and Apartheid: From SASO to SANSCO, 1968-1990 Saleem Badat Beyond Our Wildest Dreams: The United Democratic Front and the Transformation of South Africa: Reconsiderations in southern African history, Ineke van Kessel References Student organisations in South Africa Politics of South Africa Political organisations based in South Africa ","title":"Azanian Students' Organisation"},{"id":"42553373","text":"Julie E.

The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species and/or geography. Octopuses are sometimes eaten or prepared alive, a practice that is controversial due to scientific evidence that octopuses experience pain. Dishes by geography =Japan= Takoyaki Octopus is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, including sushi, takoyaki and akashiyaki. Takoyaki is a ball-shaped snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special takoyaki pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus, tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger, and green onion. Takoyaki are brushed with takoyaki sauce, similar to Worcestershire sauce, and mayonnaise. The takoyaki is then sprinkled with small strips of laver and shavings of dried bonito. =Korea= muneo-sukhoe, blanched octopus Giant octopus, long arm octopus, and webfoot octopus are common food ingredient in Korean cuisine. In Korea, some small species are sometimes eaten raw as a novelty food. A raw octopus is usually sliced up, seasoned quickly with salt and sesame seeds and eaten while still squirming posthumously. Nakji bokkeum is another popular dish in Korea. It's a type of stir-fried food made with chopped octopus. =Maldives= Miruhulee boava is a Maldivian delicacy made of octopus tentacles braised in curry leaves, chili, garlic, cloves, onion, pepper, and coconut oil. =Mauritius= In Mauritius and Rodrigues, octopus, known by its Mauritian Creole name \\"Ourite\\" is commonly eaten especially in coastal regions as it is found abundantly in Mauritian waters, although a sharp decline has been observed recently . Popular octopus dishes include the masala octopus curry or boiled octopus in spicy tomato sauce, known as the \\"Daube\\". =Greece= A common scene in the Greek islands is octopuses hanging in the sunlight from a rope, just like laundry from a clothesline. They are often caught by spear fishing close to the shore. The fisherman brings his prey to land and tenderizes the flesh by pounding the carcass against a stone surface. Thus treated, they are hung out to dry, and later will be served grilled, either hot or chilled in a salad. A common preparation technique involves classic Greek spices and seasonings, often including olive oil, garlic cloves, oregano, pepper, and lemon juice. On the whole, octopus is considered a superb meze, especially alongside ouzo. =Spain= In the Spanish region of Galicia, polbo √° feira (market fair-style octopus) is a local delicacy. Restaurants which specialize or serve this dish are known as pulper√≠as. =Portugal= Octopus and rice stew pot In Portugal octopus is eaten √† lagareiro (olive oil miller style ‚Äî roasted with potatoes, herbs, onion, garlic, and olive oil),, or stewed with rice (arroz de polvo), as well as breaded and then deep fried, with rice and beans. =Tunisia= Octopus is a common food in Mediterranean cuisine such as Tunisian cuisine. On the Tunisian island of Djerba, local people catch octopuses by taking advantage of the animals' habit of hiding in safe places during the night. In the evening, they put grey ceramic pots on the sea bed. The morning of the following day they check them for octopuses sheltered there. Also unlike its other Maghreb neighbor, seafood, including octopus is used extensively in Tunisia, grilled, roasted, in couscous, pastas or chorbas. = Turkey = In Turkey, octopus is widely used as a food ingredient for mezes. In fish restaurants octopus salad (ahtapot salatasƒ±) is one of the most popular cold mezes along with eggplant . Grilled or as a casserole, it can also be prepared hot. =United States= Octopus is eaten regularly in Hawaii, since many popular dishes are Asian in origin. Locally known by their Hawaiian or Japanese names (he'e and tako, respectively), octopus is also a popular fish bait. Nutritional value According to the USDA Nutrient Database (2007), cooked octopus contains about 56 kilocalories (Calories) per 100 grams, and is a source of vitamin B3, B12, potassium, phosphorus, and selenium. Octopus heads are high in selenium and are a risk for cadmium poisoning, even in small amounts. In 2010, over 29 mg of cadmium‚Äî14 times higher than the permitted level‚Äîwas found in the heads of octopus imported to South Korea from China.

He was also known as Eddie, and was sometimes introduced as Eddie Vallejo. Early life Vallejo was born in Mexico. As an adult, and in order to find more professional bouts, he moved to Tyler, Texas. Professional boxing career Vallejo started his professional boxing career on June 15, 1990, losing to Pauline Pumarejo by a four-round points decision in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. His next fight was his first fight abroad as a professional, when he traveled to London, England, to box Mickey Cantwell on January 21, 1991, losing that bout by knockout in round 4. Vallejo's first victory as a professional came during his third fight, when he defeated Amado Morado, on September 10, 1991, by a four-round decision at McAllen, Texas, United States. He then lost to Aureo Dominguez and Hector Lara, both by 4 round decision, and both in Texas. On March 20, 1992, Vallejo got his second win when he outpointed Rodolfo Robles over 6 rounds in Longview, Texas. Robles was 0-2 coming into their fight. Vallejo then returned to the United Kingdom, where he faced future world champion Paul Weir on April 27 of 1992 at the Forte Crest Hotel, in Glasgow, Scotland, losing by a second-round knockout. World title fight Despite having a record, until then, of 2 wins and 5 losses, Vallejo's next bout was an eliminator for a world championship fight. He fought Jesus Vera, himself making his professional boxing debut, on July 18, 1992, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and scored a first-round knockout, which turned out to be the first and only knockout victory in Vallejo's professional boxing career, and also his last win. Next, Vallejo traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he opposed Josu√© Camacho for the WBO's vacant world Junior- Flyweight crown, at the Caribe Hilton Hotel. The bout was fought only 13 days after the win against Vera, and on July 31, 1992, Vallejo lost to Camacho by a fifth-round knockout. Retirement Vallejo continued fighting after the Camacho loss for two more years, but he lost all his fights thereafter. Among those fights, there was a first-round knockout defeat at the hands of future world champion Alex S√°nchez in Camuy, Puerto Rico, and a loss to Paul Oulden at the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Record Vallejo's record was of 3 wins and 10 losses in 13 bouts as a professional, 1 win by knockout, giving him one of the lowest win totals in boxing history for a world title fight participant as well as one of the lowest win percentages among world title fight participants.

Real del Monte was a prosperous mining city under the Spanish crown, located in east-central Mexico‚Äî-today a municipality in the state of Hidalgo. The mines were owned and controlled by the Count de Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros from 1735 until Mexican independence from Spain in 1821. He is considered by many to be one of the richest and most powerful Spaniards in the colonies at the time of the strike, and is noted for his incredible business skill in restoring his bankrupt uncle's estate to one of the most prosperous silver producing regions in the whole of Spanish America (Ladd). The strike in 1766 though, in which miners protested changes in labor and wage practices under Terreros, is considered by many to be the first real labor strike in North American history, as it was not only a work stoppage, which had occurred in many places before, but an organized attempt at renegotiating labor contracts and conditions.  Background  The viceroyalty of New Spain was created after Cort√©s's defeat of the Aztec Empire in 1521. From the end of the 17th century through the beginning of the 19th, over fifty thousand tons of silver were exported from Spanish mines in the Americas to Europe and beyond (Garner, 899). The mining town of Real del Monte was settled in the late 16th century, but did not become a hub until de Torreros's arrival. Real del Monte mines are estimated to have produced more than one billion troy ounces of silver since the 16th century, the majority of which was produced under the direction of the Spanish crown (Garner 901). Due in large part to the prosperous silver mines, the viceroyalty of New Spain generated the most income for the Spanish crown of all the colonial holdings. Mines in Mexico were the most profitable in large part because government expenditures were less compared to that of the mines in Peru and other colonies. This was for two reasons: one, that higher-grade mercury was accessible and therefore implemented in Mexican mines and not Peruvian ones, and two, the Spanish Crown granted Mexican mines a special concession in 1548, lowering the royalty percentage they were required to pay (Richard Garner, 906). Because of this, mine owners and overseers in Mexico, such as the Count de Regla, became much more independently wealthy, and more politically powerful, than their Peruvian counterparts. The mines at Real del Monte are an example of the diverse specialization within the silver industry, as Real del Monte had thirty different specialized tasks carried out by different skilled laborers (Ladd 7). Real del Monte was ethnically diverse, with whites, mestizos, and indigenous peoples working alongside one another. By 1766, one hundred and thirty three black slaves also worked in the mines‚Äîa much larger number than the average among the mines of New Spain. Mexican Indians also continued to be forced into labor there for many years, even after mandates attempted to limit forced labor in favor of the Jesuit and Franciscan Reductions. The workers within Real del Monte were divided into barras, work gangs of five or six men. The majority worked in the trenches and were tasked with filling a roughly one hundred pound bag each twelve-hour shift and carrying it up 1800 notched steps steeply built into the side of the mine (Ladd 11). Workers were paid in cash as well as partidos, half of the higher-grade silver ore they mined each day outside of the quota bag. Many workers reported serious ailments and injuries resulting from working in the mines, specifically heart and lung trouble. The most cited issue was \\"excessive toil and fatigue\\" (Making of a Strike 14). Ladd, in her analysis of the working conditions during this period, states that the continued danger workers faced was their primary bargaining ground for demanding fair wages (Ladd 20).  The Strike  = Pay Changes = In 1765, the Count of Regla suffered economic losses after attempting to drain the water and rehabilitate mines in Veta Vizcaina after severe flooding. Ultimately unsuccessful and costing him over one hundred thousand pesos, he aimed to make up the loss through cost-cutting measures in the other mines. His first reform, enacted in June 1765, was the cutting of all workers' wages to slave wage level. As to be expected, this sparked initial outrage amongst the workers (Ladd 24). Other reforms introduced throughout the rest of the year were taken more gradually. Workers claimed the daily quota sack size gradually increased before finally reaching double its initial size, making it near impossible to fill in a standard twelve-hour shift. Larger, and therefore heavier, sacks also made the trek up from the bottom of the mine more dangerous. The count also began changing the partido system. The partido bags the workers split with management and then were allowed to take home had always contained higher- quality ore than the quota bags, and the count now decided half of the workers' share would now be exchanged with half of the quota share. By the end of the year, not only had the workers' standard wages been cut, but their job was also made more dangerous by the increased quota bag size and their partido shares‚Äî-a form of \\"bonus\\" yet necessary to their livelihood-‚Äîreduced to a much lower quality ore (Ladd 47-48). = First Grievance = By 1766, workers had begun holding secret meetings under the advisement of a local priest. The first grievance was drafted, signed by fifteen mine workers, \\"affirmed\\" by fifty more, and presented to the management on July 28. In it, the laborers stated that \\"today all is done to profit the boss and make the workers perish\\" (Ladd 50). That night, some of the men who signed were then forced to work an extra night shift and harshly punished by the administrators for their involvement. The following day, 250 workers and their family members marched to the treasury office in Pachuca to demand that their allegations be investigated. Royal officials promised to visit Real del Monte on July 30, and were accompanied by the striking workers up to the mines. There they witnessed the mixing of the partido and quota bags to be distributed to the few miners who were working, yet did not order the managers or overseers to change anything, and simply ordered the workers to return to the mines. = Second Grievances = On August 1, four of the leaders and organizers within the mines, Jose Vicente de Villanueva, Jose Manuel, Jose Hesabino, and Jose Anton Osorino, hired lawyer Manuel Cordero to assist them in drafting a second grievance to be sent to the viceroy. The August 1 grievance, which represented 1200 workers, went beyond the complaints in the July 28 petition to invoke larger allegations of tyranny and abuse by the Count of Regla and other administrators in the mines. Due in large part to Cordero's writing skills, the petition invoked international labor rhetoric, not just specific complaints made by individual workers. This petition in particular makes the strike stand out from previous work stoppages and other grievances in mines and other industries in years previous to Real del Monte. The Royal authorities ordered the workers to return to work in the mines, but also sent instructions for partido payment to be raised to two-thirds mixing (in which workers partido bags would contain two-thirds high quality ore and one-third lower quality quota bag ore) instead of half and half. Workers returned to Real del Monte with this very slight victory, still upset that the authorities had ignored the majority of their demands. On August 8, authorities imprisoned three of the organizers, Gonzales, Barron, and Oviedos, and proclaimed that they would be held until the end of the strike. Thousands of workers then mobilized to support their colleagues held hostage, and one experienced pikeman entered into negotiations with the Count. De Torreros agreed to return to equal partido/quota dividing. The two did not discuss the cut in peon wages though, which, even as the majority of workers returned to the mines the following day, continued to fuel anger among the workers (Ladd 55). = Violence = On August 15, 1766 the strike turned violent as workers stoned a district magistrate, Miguel Ramon de Coca, and the overseer of the La Joya mine, Manuel Barbosa, to death after pay had been doled out. For most workers, wages and partido were paid in full by the overseers, but known strike leaders, including those who had been held hostage a week earlier, were forced to mix their partidos with quota bags and therefore receive the same, lower grade partido they had been striking against. A local priest attempted to quell the angry workers and give them a lunch break, but that afternoon the anger boiled over. Violence began at the San Cayetano mine as a mob of workers interrupted a meeting between Pedro Romero de Terreros and Miguel Ramon de Coca. While de Terreros was able to escape the building unscathed, de Coca was not, and the mob began hurling stones at him and charging at him. Other overseers in the mines pulled him away from the crowd, but he sustained a crushed skull and multiple other injuries, which led to his death two days later (Ladd 58). After the first stoning of de Coca, the mob moved up the hill to La Joya and began shouting demands and rushing towards Barbosa. Barbosa pulled a knife and the crowd began to throw rocks, eventually stabbing him multiple times with his own knife and then continuing to stone him to death. After this, a group of three or four hundred moved down the hill and freed twelve prisoners from the Real del Monte jail, and then moved to the Pachuca jail to free the four miners being held by Royal officials. The workers refused to leave until all of the other prisoners had been set free. With the entire town in complete mayhem at this point, many of the miners took to the streets chanting \\"Long live the king, death to bad management!\\" a phrase that would come to be used multiple times over throughout the course of independence movements in Latin America. While the rioters and strikers did go home the night of August 15 for a rather peaceful night, Pedro Romero de Terreros fled the region and began his exile in San Miguel. The following day, over three hundred armed men from around Mexico, under direction of the viceroy, arrived in Real del Monte. The viceroy published his response, stating that the troops were not there to harm the workers, but strikers had twenty-four hours to return to work cooperatively. It was also at this point that the Royal Arbitrator Francisco de Gamboa, \\"New Spain's most experienced mining expert\\" (Ladd 61), was called by the viceroy to Real del Monte to help remedy the situation. With goals of \\"social order and full work crews,\\" Gamboa began interviewing almost every worker, supervisor, and foremen at the mines while simultaneously increasing the visibility of the soldiers around the mines (Ladd 62). After multiple days of testimonials, he drew up the plans for ordinances to be published with clear guidelines for partido mixing that had been judged fair by both workers and management. In Gamboa's plan, the overseers would appoint a captain, one of the miners, to oversee the mixing, which would result in half high quality ore and half low quality ore for both workers and management. Gamboa though, wanted to jail the ringleaders of the strike with hopes that it would convince de Terreros to return from exile in San Miguel. The Viceroy did not agree with this, and had more sympathy for the plight of the workers than Gamboa. He advised against mass roundups, and urged Gamboa to address the injustices the workers had experienced under de Terreros. Despite widespread agreement over the Gamboa Ordinances, peace did not come to the mines for another couple years. Workers continued to be upset with foremen's choices of captains to lead partido division; however, they followed the verbal guidelines outlined in Gamboa's Ordinances to express their grievances and get unpopular captains deposed from time to time. These disputes differed from the original complaints, as they were largely workers turning against other workers; a departure from the management-focused anger of the earlier half of the strike. Violence continued through the end of 1766, especially with worker-anger geared towards the more skilled mine workers who were perceived to work \\"easier\\" or \\"better\\" jobs, particularly the recogedores (Ladd). In the early part of 1767, turmoil in Real del Monte reached its height, with multiple days of riots throughout February. The authorities, however, were unable to discover any signs of conspiracy, or previous planning of the violence within the community. The few arrests that were made were based on hearsay or false evidence, but the February sweeps were the most far- reaching and resulted in the harshest sentences for many workers whose connection with organizing the strikes, or participating in the violence, was limited at best (Ladd 83). These arrests marked the end of violence and striking in Real del Monte (Ladd 91).  Aftermath  By April 1767, the total Real del Monte workforce had been reduced by 70%, and '67-'68 was called a \\"desert year,\\" as silver production fell to less than what it was in a desert (Ladd 84). After the tumultuous year of striking, silver production across the entire Pachuca area fell to less than half of what it had been in the early 1760s. Pedro Romero de Terreros did emerge from his exile, and continued to direct the mines; however, silver production levels never reached that of the pre-strike years (Ladd 93). In his later life, de Terreros's focus shifted towards more philanthropy, and less on his younger money-making years (Couturier 38). = Post-Independence = While mining practices shifted in the period after the strikes due to larger economic shifts across the entire Spanish empire, mining slowed down in the second half of the nineteenth century. Silver production had peaked in the region during the years under de Terreros's control, although after independence from Spain in 1821, a public, British-directed Real del Monte Company controlled the mines of Real del Monte. The Company began under Colonel Murphy from Liverpool, who gained power of attorney from the Count, Pedro Romero de Torreros, himself to take over contracts to run the mines after the Spanish had left Mexico (Letter to John Taylor 7). In many ways, the Cornish influence came to replace the Spanish influence in the two despite not formally colonizing it (Fernandez). Today, Real del Monte is a declared \\"Pueblo Magico\\" by the Mexican government for its historical significance as a mining hub and for its preserved, attractive downtown area which contains traces of both the Spanish influence and the Cornish presence (Fernandez). A couple of mines in the area continue to operate today, although most of the silver industry has died out. Every June, the town holds El Festival de la Plata (Silver Festival), a festival for silver artisans to display and sell their work. They also hold the \\"Day of the Miner\\" celebrations on July 11, with events to commemorate the towns' labor history (Fernandez).  References  *Ladd, Doris M.

Written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by co-creator Brad Falchuk, it aired on Fox in the United States on May 13, 2014, and features the return of special guest star Shirley MacLaine as rich socialite June Dolloway in her second and last appearance.  Plot The regular Monday- night dinner is being held at Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Kurt Hummel's (Chris Colfer) apartment, and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) shows up unexpectedly. To her disappointment, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) is not there‚Äîshe is in Iowa shooting a commercial‚Äîand then a second, expected visitor arrives: famed screenwriter Mary Halloran (Kristen Schaal), who has been sent by the network to create a television script for Rachel to star in. The two of them later meet, and Rachel is clearly nonplussed by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) kicks off a nationwide shopping mall concert tour in New York; her label has added Brittany as her star backup dancer, with Santana set to join them in Reno. Her boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is chosen as the new underwear model for a major ad campaign. With Mercedes leaving, their friends separately urge them to break off their relationship, as they feel the strains of being apart yet faithful will be unfair to Sam, who is already struggling with abstinence. Despite the advice, both Mercedes and Sam decide to continue as a couple. Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) meets with wealthy socialite June Dolloway (Shirley MacLaine) in advance of their NYADA showcase; he makes one more attempt to add Kurt to the event, and she is unequivocal: she will drop her sponsorship if he tries. When Kurt arrives after she leaves, Blaine confesses that Kurt is not actually in the show, but he had been hoping to convince June to include him. Kurt is furious that Blaine has again lied to him, and storms out. Later, the two reconcile: Blaine is no longer eager to do the showcase since Kurt is not welcome to perform in it, and Kurt acknowledges that they will invariably hurt one another even though they are together and their love is real, and urges him to shine at the event. The friends gather to read Mary's script: with the exception of Brittany, they think it is terrible. Later, Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. At Sam's model shoot, the \\"sex buzz\\" present during his audition is gone. The photographer who cast him clears the room, tells him that no one will know what happens there, and kisses him. When he returns to the apartment, he confesses to Mercedes that he cheated, though it was only the one kiss, and he burst into tears. Mercedes admits that she may not be ready for years, which she feels is unfair to Sam, so though they love each other, they ultimately decide to formally end their relationship, which could nevertheless resume whenever Mercedes feels ready. The NYADA showcase June presents for Blaine is a big success, and he and June end with a duet. He is called back to do an encore, and telling the audience that to know him means knowing the love of his life, asks Kurt to join him. June looks angry for much of the song, but her expression softens, and she joins in the dance at the end, and tells Blaine she was wrong. The assembled friends read Mary's new script, and they all love it except for Brittany. A bus stops outside the apartment with Sam's ad featured on the outside, and though Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) congratulates him on the start of a big career, Sam says it is the finish: he is moving back to Lima where things are slower‚Äîeveryone is scattering anyway. The final song shows them doing just that: Mercedes and Brittany leave for their tour, Blaine moves back in with Kurt and Rachel, Artie is busy at film school, and Sam is seen back at McKinley, looking in on the computer lab that has taken over the choir room. As the episode ends, Rachel gets a call from the network: they want her to film the pilot. Production Production of the episode began in mid-April, and included a Saturday shoot on April 26, 2014. Michele recorded her final song of the season, \\"Glitter in the Air\\"‚Äîwhich co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk allowed her to select‚Äîon April 16, and filmed it on April 29. Filming for the episode and season ended on May 2, 2014, eleven days before the episode aired on May 13 as the season's finale. According to Murphy, the events of the episode, including to the two current New York couples Kurt and Blaine, and Mercedes and Sam‚Äî\\"something big happens\\"‚Äîwill set up the sixth and final season of the show. Chris Colfer, who plays Kurt Hummel, said that the season \\"has a really nice conclusion\\" and that \\"every character gets a good send- off\\". Special guest star Shirley MacLaine returns as socialite June Dolloway. Other recurring characters appearing in this episode include McKinley High alumnae Mercedes Jones (Riley) and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris). One character that does not appear is the character coupled with Brittany, Santana Lopez, played by cast regular Naya Rivera. Although originally set to be in the episode, Santana was later written out. Seven songs from the episode are being released on a digital seven-track EP with the title Glee: The Music, The Untitled Rachel Berry Project. These include the original song \\"Shakin' My Head\\" sung by Riley, John Legend's \\"All of Me\\" sung by Criss, Duran Duran's \\"Girls on Film\\" sung by Overstreet featuring Beau Garrett, Pink's \\"Glitter in the Air\\" sung by Michele, \\"No Time at All\\" from Pippin performed by MacLaine and Criss, Estelle's (feat.

The film starts with the story of a notable family who lives in the house right after the fall of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). When the family's third son, Huo Lianqi (Tony Yang) falls in love with a prostitute named Lu Dieyu (also Lin), his request to marry her is refused and instead the family force Lu to marry their second recently deceased son in a posthumous wedding ceremony. Going from the wedding directly to the funeral, the family throws Lu Dieyu into a coffin with the pale-faced dead body of her new husband. After being locked in the coffin with her newly-wed and deceased husband, Huo Lianqi rushes back to the house upon hearing of the news that she was married to his second brother. He released her from the coffin and they got married on the spot in front of the coffin and consummated their marriage in the same room unbeknownst to the family. The day after, Lu Dieyu woke up only to find Huo Lianqi gone. The scene flashes back to the present, Xu Ruoqing started having visions around the mansion, and this condition grew worse with each passing day in the mansion. Her daughter has come to her several nights claiming that a young girl dressed in red kept wanting to play with her. Horrified, Xu Ruoqing started asking for Zhao Yitang to come back to accompany her and their daughter for the nights, only to have him rejecting her requests as his company are currently facing funding issues and usually spent the nights with his assistant, Liu Li (Monica Mok) to source out potential investors. Incidentally, Liu Li is also Xu Ruoqing's best friend who was the one who brought the two of them together. Liu Li has pointed out in a conversation that Zhao Yitang was actually still in a marriage with his wife and the divorce papers have not been signed by his wife (Patricia Ha), contrary to what Xu Ruoqing thought. Getting increasingly disturbed by the visions around the mansion, with Zhao Yitang's absence around the house at night, Xu Ruoqing started getting suspicious that Zhao Yitang might actually be having an affair with Liu Li. The scene cuts back to the past, where Lu Dieyu was shown to be pregnant with Huo Lianqi's child on the night of their consummation. Despite being married to the deceased second son of the family, the family thought that it is strange that she is pregnant as the physician deduced that the child was supposedly conceived on the night of marriage. The eldest son, Huo Lianxiu (also Francis) however, allowed for her to kept her child. Lu Dieyu was then moved to the basement of the mansion to await her pregnancy. Lu Dieyu was seen to be continuously writing letters back-and-forth to Huo Lianqi, even after her daughter was born, she continued writing and receiving letters from Huo Lianqi but he was not seen to have returned to the mansion, writing in one of his letters that he's studying abroad and will return once he's graduated. Back at the present, Xu Ruoqing confronted Liu Li on whether she is having an affair with Zhao Yitang, to which she rejected and explained that Zhao Yitang's company is having a lot of financial issues and she is only maintaining a strict workers relationship with Zhao Yitang. Feeling a mix of emotions of guilt, fear and insecurity, Xu Ruoqing turned to her old friend, who is also a psychologist (Qin Hailu) for consultation on her current situation. Her visions in the house did not go away, her daughter came to her one night to ask her for help in catching a red butterfly, where she was led to the basement of the mansion where Lu Dieyu stayed during her pregnancy. In there, she found a box of letters and photos, and realised that she looked identical to the Lu Dieyu in the photos. Having found a surviving servant from the Huo's family in the mansion, Gen, told Xu Ruoqing about the tragedy of the Huo family that unfolds. Huo Lianxiu's wife (also Patricia Ha) suspected that Huo Lianxiu is gradually being attracted to Lu Dieyu, and under the persuasion of her brother and cousin, agreed to letting them put in Marijuana into Lu Dieyu's herbal medicine and letting her consume it, making Lu Dieyu seems 'crazier' which will hopefully make her husband less interested in her. On the other hand, Huo Lianxiu went to the basement to find Lu Dieyu with Huo Lianqi's death certificate, telling her that Huo Lianqi has passed away long ago, and the person who has been writing letters to her was him all along. Huo Lianxiu has fallen in love with her since and wanted to bring her with him to leave the family, Lu Dieyu rejected and pushed him out, unable to believe that Huo Lianqi has been dead all along. Unable to cope with Huo Lianqi's death, Lu Dieyu killed herself in the basement while wearing her red wedding dress. Huo Lianxiu learnt of her suicide and wanted to join her in death, stopping when he saw her daughter by Lu Dieyu's body. On the 7th day of Lu Dieyu's funeral, everybody in the mansion died, including Huo Lianxiu's wife, her brother and cousin. Huo Lianxiu decided to grow her daughter as his own and left the mansion. In the present, Zhao Yitang has been called by his wife where he was given the option of having a cheque with a huge funds to save his career, only if he agrees to tear up the divorce papers. Zhao Yitang refused, and finally his wife revealed that it's too late for him to do anything now. She has been bribing Gen, agreeing to let him inherit the mansion, on the condition that he changes Xu Ruoqing's medicines with another chemical substance that will cause Xu Ruoqing to hallucinate and these hallucinations might eventually kill her. Meanwhile, Xu Ruoqing are escaping from all the servants who have died in the mansion, and flee with her daughter to the basement of the mansion, managing to find some peace over there. The little girl in red whom her daughter claimed to have encountered previously appeared, revealing that she's actually the daughter of Zhao Yitang and his wife and had been instructed by the wife to dress in red all the time in the mansion and her daddy will come back to her. Zhao Yitang rushed back to the mansion, finally reuniting with Xu Ruoqing and both his daughters in the basement. Upon returning to the main area of the mansion, Gen pushed out a wheelchair and explained that Huo Lianqi has returned after the tragedy only to find the house empty. Huo Lianqi had been waiting at the house for the return of Xu Ruoqing, and Gen wanted the mansion for him and Huo Lianqi as he believes Huo Lianqi is the rightful owner of the mansion. Gen turned the wheelchair around, only to reveal the decomposed body of Huo Lianqi, and chased Zhao Yitang's family out of the mansion. The movie ended as the decomposed body slowly turned into dust as Xu Ruoqing left the mansion.

Shortened, it is part of current Protestant and Catholic German hymnals.  History  Wei√üe published his text in 1531 in his hymnal for the Bohemian Brethren, with a melody known from the beginning of the 15th century and used in Czech congregations in Bohemian Hussite hymnals. Wei√üe structured the text in three parts, two stanzas of praise, fifteen stanzas of narration, and three stanzas of prayer to Jesus. Each stanza consists of three rhyming lines in similar meter, and a \\"Halleluja\\" refrain. In 1609, the hymn appeared in the Lutheran hymnal by Melchior Vulpius from Weimar, who composed a different tune and two harmonisations, one for four parts, one for five parts. With this melody, the hymn became widely known in the 19th century by publication in the hymnals of Johann Gottlieb Tucher and Philipp Wackernagel. The number of stanzas was reduced considerably, because of less interest in a long narration and a focus on the Passion. The hymn was translated to English in several versions, for example \\"Good Christians All, Rejoice and Sing\\" by Cyril A. Alington in 1931. Other hymns sung to the tune Gelobt sei Gott include \\"O Lord of Life, Where'er They Be\\". In the current German Protestant hymnal (EG), the hymn is number 103. It has one stanza of praise, three stanzas of narration and two of prayer. Praise and narration correspond to stanzas 1, 4, 9 and 10 of the first version, the two stanzas of praise are derived from the three stanzas in the long version. The first melody still appears in the EG, as number 105, with the text \\"\\" (Risen is the holy Christ), based on the Latin . \\"\\", the same six stanzas as in the EG, is part of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob (GL), number 218 in the old version, number 328 in the current version.  Music  The first melody is in triple meter. A version by Valentin Triller (1555) adds syncopes to accent the ends of the first and third line, as elements of folk music. The tune was well known, probably also by Vulpius (whose setting is transcribed below) who used the same features. The strongest influence on his composition are Italian , such as by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi and Hans Leo Hassler. The repeated \\"Halleluja\\" is similar to the \\"fa-la-la\\" refrain of some , adding a dancing swing. << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 6/4 \\\\partial 4*3 \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c << { c4 b a g2 g4 a2 b4 c2 r4 c4 c d g,2 c4 b a2 g2 r4 g4 e a g2 f4 e d2 c2 r4 c'4 c b c4.( b8 a4) g4 g fis g4.( f!8 e4) d c b c2. \\\\bar\\"|.\\" } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g'4 g e e2 e4 f( e) g g2 r4 e4 f f e2 a4 g2 fis4 g2 r4 e4 g f e2 d4 c2 b4 c2 r4 g'4 g4.( f8 e4) e f d d4.( c8 b4) b c b c d e2. } >> } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { Ge4 -- lobt sei Gott2 im4 h√∂ch2 -- sten4 Thron2 \\"\\"4 samt4 sei -- nem ein2 -- ge4 -- bor -- nen2 Sohn, \\"\\"4 der4 f√ºr uns hat2 ge4 -- nug ge2 -- tan. \\"\\"4 Hal4 -- le -- lu -- ja,2.

The movie is an adaption of Ernest Claes' novel De Witte. It is the second adaption of the book. The other movie was released in 1934 as De Witte. The title Whitey refers to the nickname of the main character: Louis Verheyden, a naughty blond boy of eleven years old. Plot The movie is set in and around Sichem in 1901. Louis Verheyden, 11 years old, lives with his parents and two brothers on a farm. His mother is an irritable woman who complains a lot. Father works at the farm of landowner Coene. He is mostly home only during dinner. He is a rather aggressive man and frequently beats Louis. Furthermore, Louis is bullied by his brothers Nis and Heinke. Louis hates school. This is mostly caused by their teacher, a very hard man who likes to punish his pupils. Corporal punishment was not yet forbidden in those days and the children are cuffed on the ears or put into the coal chamber by the teachers. Louis is a naughty boy. He gives others incorrect directions, tries to haggle of money from his brothers, ties people to their chairs during church service, steals smoking materials from Coene, gives his family members instructions to put salt onto the potatoes (resulting they are salted three times), chases off the Coene's horses, ... Louis is almost caught every time which results in another punishment. His most humiliating punishment was when he went swimming in the river Demer although this was forbidden by his parents. When his mother arrived at the river, Louis hid and his friends tried to deceive the mother by telling her that they had not seen Louis. However, mother found his clothes and took them away. As a result, Louis had to go home naked. Louis is sent by Coene to Averbode Abbey to deliver a package. There he is impressed by the beautiful interior, the Gregorian singing, the garden full of flowers and the printing establishment. One day, Louis is again punished by his teacher and put in the cellar. There he finds some books written by Hendrik Conscience. His attention goes to the book De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (translated as 'The Lion of Flanders') and is fascinated by the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Inspired by this battle, he needles up his friends to replay a fight scene. Some injured children run to their home. Their mothers and the local priest come to the battle. Louis, wholly engrossed in his role as warrior Jan Breydel, is not at all aware that he has just started a \\"sword fight\\" with the priest. Desperate, the mother sends Louis and Heinke on a pilgrimage hoping the Lord will turn Louis into a well-behaved boy. They end up in a street fight between the police and supporters of the socialist movement and have to flee into a pub. However, the pub seems to be owned by socialists. Heinke, a catholic, tries to impress the female bartender by telling her that he also supports socialism. Louis thinks this is blasphemy and threatens Heinke with informing on his girlfriend Liza. It's the annual fair and Louis deceives his brother by telling him his mother has promised to give 15 Belgian Cents. At the fair, Louis meets his mother. Louis complains he has no money, resulting in his getting some more pocket money. Of course, mother finds out Louis was given money twice. His father is furious and demands his son must work for Coene to retrieve the money or be sent to a community home. Meanwhile, two incidents happen: Louis tries to commit suicide in the river Demer whilst Liza ends her relationship with Heinke. The last action ends up in a fight in a spiegeltent where the funfair ball takes place. The movie is then set to 1980 where a blond student, resembling Louis (it is actually actor Eric Clerckx with another haircut), is working in the printing establishment of Averbode Abbay. When he drops a box, he is scolded by his boss. In the box is the 117th reprint of the novel, \\"Whitey\\". Reception The movie was received with mixed feelings. It has a score 6.6/10 on IMDB.COM whereas it got a 4.5/5 on rotten tomatoes. Differences from the novel There are some differences from the novel. The love story between Heinke and Liza is not in the original story, as neither is Louis' suicide attempt. Louis does not go with his brother on a pilgrimage. Instead, he goes with his father to the city to buy a cap for his holy communion. At the end of the book, it is also clear Louis applied with success for a job at the printing establishment of Averbode Abbay, but the time is of course still set at the beginning of 1900 whereas the film ends up in 1980.

Mosquito-malaria theory (or sometimes mosquito theory) was a scientific theory developed in the latter half of the 19th century that solved the question of how malaria was transmitted. The theory basically proposed that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes, in opposition to the centuries-old medical dogma that malaria was due to bad air, or miasma. The first scientific idea was postulated in 1851 by Charles E. Johnson, who argued that miasma had no direct relationship with malaria. Although Johnson's hypothesis was forgotten, the arrival and validation of the germ theory of diseases in the late 19th century began to shed new lights. When Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that malaria was caused by a protozoan parasite in 1880, the miasma theory began to subside. An important discovery was made by Patrick Manson in 1877 that mosquito could transmit human filarial parasite. Inferring from such novel discovery Albert Freeman Africanus King proposed the hypothesis that mosquitoes were the source of malaria. In the early 1890s Manson himself began to formulate the complete hypothesis, which he eventually called the mosquito- malaria theory. According to Manson malaria was transmitted from human to human by a mosquito. The theory was scientifically proved by Manson's confidant Ronald Ross in the late 1890s. Ross discovered that malaria was transmitted by the biting of specific species of mosquito. For this Ross won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902. Further experimental proof was provided by Manson who induced malaria in healthy human subjects from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Thus the theory became the foundation of malariology and the strategy of control of malaria. Early concepts Malaria was prevalent in the Roman Empire, and the Roman scholars associated the disease with the marshy or swampy lands where the disease was particularly rampant. It was from those Romans the name \\"malaria\\" originated. They called it malaria (literally meaning \\"bad air\\") as they believed that the disease was a kind of miasma that was spread in the air, as originally conceived by Ancient Greeks. Then it was a medical consensus that malaria was spread due to miasma, the bad air. However, in Medieval West Africa, specifically Djenn√©, the people were able to identify the mosquito as the cause of malaria. The first record of argument against the miasmatic nature of malaria was from an American physician John Crawford. Gorgas wrote an article \\"Mosquital Origin of Malarial Disease\\" in Baltimore Observer in 1807, but it provoked no consequences. An American physician Charles Earl Johnson provided a systematic and elaborate arguments against miasmatic origin of malaria in 1851 before the Medical Society of North Carolina. Some of his important points were: #The delta of the Mississippi was a recorded healthy place although it has a nearby river, ponds, marshes and lots of stagnant water. #Labourers of North Carolina were the healthiest people of working classes in spite of their constant exposure to swamps, and drinking swamp water. #South American countries such as British Guiana and Brazil which were literally flooded with tropical swamps were free from malaria epidemics. #Java Island in Southeast Asia, a region known for epidemics, had luxuriant vegetation and agricultural fields, supplemented with hot and wet tropical climate, ideal for miasmatic disease, was but the healthiest part of Asia. #A highly polluted River Thames, which should cause miasmatic diseases, was but a good source of drinking water. #On the other hand, the driest regions such as Guinea in Africa, Spain, Malta, Gibraltar, and several states of America, were frequented with malarial fevers. Scientific grounds =Disproof of miasma theory of malaria= The notion that malaria was due to miasma was negated by the discovery of malarial parasite. A German physician Johann Heinrich Meckel was the first to observed in 1847 the protozoan parasites as black pigment granules from the blood and spleen of a patient who died of malaria. But he did not understand the parasitic nature and significance of those granules in connection with malaria. In 1849 a German pathologist Rudolf Virchow realised that it could be those granules that were responsible for the disease. In 1879 an Italian biologist Ettore Afanasiev further argued that the granules were definitely the causative agents. Laveran's drawing of pigmented parasites and the exflagellation of male gametocytes A major discovery was made by a French Army physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran working in Algeria, North Africa. At the hospital in B√¥ne (now Annaba), he noticed spherical bodies from a patient‚Äôs blood film, free or adherent to red blood cells. On 6 November 1880 he observed from one patient's blood the actual living parasite, describing it as \\"a pigmented spherical body, filiform elements which move with great vivacity, displacing the neighboring red blood cells.\\" He also observed the process of maturation of the parasite (which is now called exflagellation of microgametocytes). He meticulously examined 200 patients, and noted the cellular bodies in all 148 cases of malaria but never in those without malaria. He also found that after treatment with quinine, the parasites disappeared from blood. These findings clearly indicated that the parasite was the cause of malaria, and establishing the germ theory (nature) of malaria. He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae (later renamed Plasmodium malariae) and reported his discovery to the French Academy of Medicine in Paris on 23 November and 28 December. For his discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1907. =Discovery of mosquito as disease vector= In the early 1880s Laveran's germ theory of malaria was generally accepted by the science community. However pivotal problems still remained, such as what transmit the malarial parasites and how. The scientific clue emerged when a British medical officer Patrick Manson discovered for the first time that parasites were transmitted by mosquitoes. In 1877 while working in Amoy, a coastal town in China, he found that the mosquito Culex fatigans (now Culex quinquefasciatus) was the vector of the filarial roundworm that he called Filaria sanguinis hominis (but now Wuchereria bancrofti). His findings were published in the China Customs Medical Report in 1878, and relayed by Spencer Cobbold to the Linnean Society in London. This was the first direct evidence that mosquitoes could transmit microscopic parasites in humans, further suggesting that the same could be true in case of malaria. King's theory Based on the report of Manson's discovery, an American physician Albert Freeman Africanus King developed a proposition that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. He revealed his idea in 1881 to his colleagues C.V. Riley and L.O. Howard, who did not share the same opinion. Unfettered he developed the theory with proper justifications and presented it before the Philosophical Society of Washington on 10 February 1882, under the title \\"The Prevention of Malarial Disease Illustrating inter alia the Conservative Function of Ague\\". He went so far as to suggest the complete covering of Washington, DC along the Washington Monument with giant net to protect the city from malaria. His idea was ridiculed as inconceivable as scientist still believed malarial parasite was spread through inhalation or ingestion from air (still not far from the miasma theory). He did not give up, and instead formed a more elaborate argument which he published as a 15-page article in the September 1883 issue of The Popular Science Monthly, making an introduction as: King carefully selected his view in 19 points. To paraphrase his lengthy arguments: occurrence of malaria always coincided with conditions that are also ideal for mosquitos, such as in the time of day, geographical area, temperature, and climate. But the flaw in his proposition was that he believed malaria was transmitted by mosquito through its eggs. Manson's theory In 1889 Patrick Manson returned to England and worked at the Seamen's Hospital Society and also as lecturer on tropical diseases in St George's Hospital at London in 1882. His attention was soon drawn towards malaria and began to realise the implications of his own discovery of filarial transmission on malaria. He strongly supported Laveran's germ theory of malaria, which was not yet completely embraced by the entire medical community of the time. He proposed that: #malaria is caused by protozoan parasite, #the protozoan is transmitted by mosquito, and (falsely) #humans are infected from contaminated water in which infected mosquito had died. Manson was unfortunate that he could not investigate his theory as he was not in malaria endemic country such as India, where it could be experimentally proven. But fortunately he met a British army surgeon Ronald Ross, who was on vacation while serving in the Indian Medical Service in India. In November 1894, he revealed to Ross with his hands on Ross' shoulders, saying, \\"Do you know, I have formed the theory that mosquitoes carry malaria just as they carry filaria.\\" Proof The page in Ross' notebook where he recorded the \\"pigmented bodies\\" in mosquitoes that he later identified as malaria parasites In 1894 Patrick Manson devised an ingenious procedure for detecting malarial parasites at different developmental stages from blood samples. This would later proved to be the tool for experimental proof of his theory. Manson demonstrated to and taught Ronald Ross the technique from which Ross became convinced of Laveran's germ theory. Trained and mentored by Manson, Ross returned to India in March 1895 to start his investigation. But to the dismay of Ross it was not an easy task. His first detection of malarial parasite from patients came only after two months of hard work. The disappointed Ross had to be encouraged by Manson calling the study as the \\"Holy Grail\\" of malaria research, and that Ross was the \\"Sir Galahad\\". After one and half years he made no significant progress. On 20 August 1897 he made a momentous discovery that some mosquitoes had malarial parasites in them. He had fed the blood of a malarial patient (Husein Khan) to different groups of mosquitoes four days before, and found that only one type (which he called \\"brown type\\" or more commonly \\"dappled-winged mosquitoes\\", not knowing the species, which in fact was Anopheles) acquired the malarial parasites in its stomach. This was the first evidence for Manson's theory that mosquito did carry the malarial parasite, and Ross would later famously call 20 August as \\"Malaria Day\\" (now adopted as World Mosquito Day). The second experimental evidence came in the mid-1898 when Ross demonstrated the transmission of bird malaria Proteosoma relictum (now Plasmodium relictum) between larks and mosquitoes, which he called \\"grey mosquitos\\" (which were Culex fatigans, but now renamed Culex quinquefasciatus). He showed that the mosquitoes ingested the parasites from infected birds and could infect healthy birds. He further discovered that the parasites developed in the stomach wall and were later stored in salivary glands of the mosquito. This was a conclusive evidence that malarial parasites were indeed transmitted by mosquitoes. In his report Ross concluded that: On 9 July 1898 Ross wrote Manson: Ross' scientific evidences were soon fortified by Italian biologists including Giovanni Battista Grassi, Amico Bignami, and Giuseppe Bastianelli, who discovered that human malarial parasite was transmitted by the actual biting (disproving one of Manson's hypotheses) of female mosquito. In 1899 they reported the infection of Plasmodium falciparum with the mosquito Anopheles claviger However the practical importance of validating the theory, i.e. control of mosquito vector should be an effective management strategy for malaria, was not realised by the medical community and the public. Hence in 1900 Patrick Manson clinically demonstrated that the bite of infected anopheline mosquitoes invariably resulted in malaria. He acquired carefully reared infected mosquitoes from Bignami and Bastianelli in Rome. His volunteer at the London School of Tropical Medicine, P. Thurburn Manson gave a detailed account of his malarial fevers and treatment after bitten by the mosquitoes. As he summarised, Manson's clinical trial showed that the practical solution to malaria infection was in: #avoiding the neighborhood of native houses where mosquitoes are abundant, #destroying tha habitats of mosquitoes, and #protection from mosquito bite.

Description and history The Micajah Martin House stands in a rural setting in eastern Dublin, at the western end of Old Peterborough Road near its junction with New Hampshire Route 101. It is a -story timber-frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and large central chimney. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance that is framed by sidelight windows. A series of ells extend to the rear, joining the house to a barn. Gabled dormers, also a later addition, project from the front roof face. The house was built about 1802, probably by Micajah Martin, replacing the log house that was the first on the property, and is typical of the farmhouses built in Dublin in that period. It has retained its original fireplace and beehive oven, and features wooden paneling recovered from a now-demolished house of the same period. The house was bought by historian Frederick Lewis Weis in 1951, and was still in that family when it was listed on the National Register in 1983.

Nar Bahadur Khatiwada was born to Dal Bahadur Khatiwada, a WW-II veteran who served in 3rd Battalion of the 5th Regiment, Gorkha Rifles of the British Indian Army and Lachimaya Khatiwada on 14 April 1947 in Bhaluthang, a remote village of West Sikkim. He did his initial schooling in Pelling Senior Secondary School, West Sikkim. While he was studying in Class X, he joined electioneering campaign for Kharga Bahadur Khatiwada, his elder father, of Kazi Lendup Dorji Khangsharpa‚Äôs Sikkim National Congress party which was in the opposition for the Sikkim Council scheduled for 1970. As a result, he was not allowed to continue his studies in Sikkim. LD Kazi, who went on to become the first Chief Minister of Sikkim, not only took him to Kalimpong for completing his schooling in Scottish University Mission Institution School but also legally adopted him as his son. After completing schooling in 1971, Nar Bahadur Khatiwada joined Government College, Kalimpong and graduated in Political Science (Hon). In Kalimpong, he became the student and youth leader and organized Sikkim youths studying outside Sikkim and motivated them for bringing about democracy in the state of Sikkim. In 1972, Sikkim National Congress published Bulletin number 2 under the name of Nar Bahadur Khatiwada as Assistant Publicity Secretary. The said Bulletin inter alia wrote \\"‚Ä¶.there can be no king without the people but there are countries without king. As such, the Chogyal and his coterie must see the writings on the wall and give democracy to the people of Sikkim and or else a day will come when the Chogyal will have to hand over power to strange successor\\". Taking this as a seditious statement, the Chogyal administration registered a case against LD Kazi, Publicity Secretary Dhan Bahadur Gurung and Nar Bahadur Khatiwada in 1972. In 1973, there was a popular peoples‚Äô revolution for democracy, one man one vote with a written constitution etc. in which Nar Bahadur Khatiwada played an important role in mobilising the Sikkimese people. This movement ultimately resulted in the merger of Sikkim with the Indian Union in 1975 as the 22nd State. He was elected as Member of Sikkim Legislative Assembly for two consecutive terms i.e. from 1974 to 1979 and 1979 to 1985. Nar Bahadur Khatiwada completed his Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Political Science and Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) from North Bengal University (NBU). He is a member of Bar Council of West Bengal. He is also a Member of the Supreme Court Bar Association. He was appointed Additional Advocate General for the state of Sikkim from 22 December 2000 to 13 February 2004. He was designated Senior Advocate by the Hon‚Äôble High Court of Sikkim w.e.f 7 April 2005. Nar Bahadur Khatiwada attended Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in the Bahamas in the Year 1982 and attended many conferences in Delhi and other State Capitals. He is widely travelled to include countries like Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, United States (more than 10 States), Bahamas, England, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France etc. in Europe, Nepal, Bhutan and Burma. He was conferred the Roll of Honour 2000 by the government of Sikkim for his contribution towards ushering in the era of Democracy and providing leadership to the people of Sikkim. He was awarded the International Civil Golden Award by Civil Forum Nepal in the year 2005 (2061 B.S.). He was awarded the Sikkim Sewa Ratna (Highest civilian award of the state) in 2013 by the Government of Sikkim in recognition of his valuable contribution to the State.

Built in 1888, it is a fine example of Shingle style architecture, with elements of the Richardsonian Romanesque inspired by architect Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow's mentor H. H. Richardson. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Mason House is located in central Dublin, on the east side of Snow Hill Road, about south of New Hampshire Route 101. It is situated on a ridge overlooking the Peterborough hills. It is a two-story structure, with a rough stone first floor and a shingled timber-frame second story. It is capped by a hip roof, and features groupings of sash windows along its walls. The house was designed by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow and built in 1888. Originally a summer house three stories in height, this Shingle style house was reduced to two stories in 1950 when it was prepared for year-round occupancy. Its style is reminiscent of early work of H. H. Richardson, in whose firm Longfellow served as a draftsman. The house was built for a pair of spinster sisters, Ella and Ida Mason, who were friends of Raphael Pumpelly, whose summer estate was nearby. The house was occupied in 1910 by James Bryce, then the UK Ambassador to the United States, and was informally dubbed the \\"British Summer Embassy\\". It was also used as a summer house by Sir Cecil Spring Rice, also a UK ambassador, and Henry White, an American ambassador.

It was originally built about 1889 as a single-story wing of the nearby Stonehenge estate house. It is a good example of Shingle style architecture, and one of the town's surviving reminders of the turn-of-the- century summer estate period. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The McKenna Cottage is located in a rural setting southeast of Dublin's village center, on the north side of Windmill Hill Road east of its junction with Parsons Road. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and shingled exterior. It has brick chimneys at the ends, and four shed-roof dormers projecting from the steep face of the roof. The ground floor of the front facade is five bays wide, with the entrance in the center-right bay. Windows are uniformly six- over-six sash windows. The house was built as a single-story structure that was part of the main house of the nearby Stonehenge summer estate of the Parson family. It was raised to two stories in 1904, and separated from the main house and moved to its present location on the north side of the hill in 1954. It continues to exhibit the Shingle styling of its original construction, a signature style of Dublin's summer estates.

It is a redundant Anglican parish church, and was converted into a conservation centre in 2006. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Mary's was built to accommodate the increasing population of the town in the early 19th century. Building began in May 1836 and the church opened in 1838. The church was designed by John Latham, and was extended in a matching style with the addition of transepts and a chancel in 1852‚Äì56 by E. H. Shellard. The church was declared redundant by the diocese of Blackburn on 1 March 1996, and was converted into a conservation centre for the Museum of Lancashire in 2006. Architecture The church is constructed in sandstone and has a slate roof. It is orientated in a north-south axis and is in Romanesque Revival style. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, east and west transepts, and a chancel. All the windows are round-headed. At the south end of the church is a tower flanked by wings. The tower is in four stages, the bottom stage being in three storeys. The lowest of these storeys contains a round-headed doorway with three orders of moulding. Both of the upper storeys contain a three-light window. Each of the three upper stages is set back, with two-light bell openings in the second and third stages. The top stage consists of a drum with corner cylinders, on which is a needle spire with lucarnes. The wings flanking the tower are of a similar height to its first stage. Both have round-headed doorways with a window above, and clasping pilasters, the outer one surmounted by squat pinnacles. The east and west sides of the wings are gabled. Along the sides of the nave the windows are set in round-headed arches, and the bays are divided by pilasters. The transepts also have clasping pilasters, and at the corners these rise to two-stage turrets containing blind arcading and topped by pyramidal caps. The chancel contains three lancet windows, with a circular window above. External features The gates, gate piers, and the walls surrounding the churchyard are also listed at Grade II. The walls and gate piers are in sandstone. The piers have a square plan, with panelled sides, and have plain caps with pyramidal tops. The walls form a boundary on the east and south sides of the churchyard, and incorporate twelve piers similar in style to the gate piers. The gates are ramped, their railings having spear heads. There are matching railings on a section of the wall, but the other railings were replaced in the 20th century. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 27 September 1979, and the gates, gate piers and walls on 20 December 1991. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". Hartwell and Pevsner in the Buildings of England series comment that the outline of the church \\"seems to owe a debt to the pinnacles at the west end of Tewkesbury Abbey\\" and that the massing of the architectural details is \\"reminiscent\\" of works by Christopher Wren and Nicholas Hawksmoor.

History =First castle= During the Middle Ages the Fribourg noble family of Riggisberg was established with a seat in Riggisberg. The first one that appears in a historical record is Constantin de Rucasperc in 1140. His grandson Jacob Riggisberg established the Franciscan monastery in Fribourg on 15 May 1256 and was probably living in the city by that time. The family soon lost or sold all their rights and land in the village and by the 13th century other nobles and monasteries owned parts of the village. In 1337 the Riggisberg line died out and their remaining estates passed on to other owners.Swiss Castles.ch accessed 22 April 2014 The castle was acquired by Rudolf and Hans von Diesbach who then sold it to Jonatha von Billingen and her husband Jordan von Burgistein. The estate was then divided between his descendants and in 1345-46 was divided between Petermann von Burgistein and his sister Agnes. When Agnes married Peterman von Wichtrach in 1354, he acquired her half of the castle and estates. In 1362-63 he bought the other half of the estate from Petermann von Burgistein's sons, Konrad and Petermann von Burgistein. By 1358 Rudolph of Neuch√¢tel-Nidau owned the high court rights over the Herrschaft that included the castle, the village of Riggisberg, scattered farms and the courts of Riggisberg and Ruti. He granted Petermann von Wichtrach the full Zwing und Bann rights over the village on 28 September 1358. Peter's daughter and heiress Elizabeth von Wichtrach married Walther von Erlach in 1387, bringing the castle and lands to the powerful Bernese Erlach family for over 400 years. The castle remained with the Erlach family, but was inherited by various cousins and relatives over the following centuries. In 1686, Hans Rudolf von Erlach lost the rights to the castle due to a judgement of the court. The castle was sold to Gabriel von Wattenwyl and on 17 November 1686 he became the Schultheiss and owner of Riggisberg. Four months later he sold the estate and title to Albrecht von Erlach and the estate came back under the Erlach name. Around 1700 Albrecht decided to build a new, more comfortable castle near the First or Long Castle. The Long Castle remained in use for centuries afterward, but its importance waned. In 1938 it was demolished to make way for a new outbuilding that attaches to the Second Castle. =Second castle= In 1700 Albrecht von Erlach's new and more comfortable castle was finished. Because his only child, a daughter, was handicapped, in 1723 he willed the castle to Albert and Abraham von Erlach from another line. In 1735 Abraham von Erlach retired as a mercenary lieutenant-general in French service and returned to Riggisberg. He brought with him his noble wife, the Marquise Masson de Bess√© and a black servant in livery, which excited the villagers. His son Abraham Friedrich von Erlach quickly spend his father's and his wife's fortunes and 1793 he was forced to sell the castle to his brother Karl Albrecht Ferdinand von Erlach. Karl Albrecht Ferdinand was a member of the Swiss Guard in the French court and was the last owner to hold the Zwing und Bann right over the villagers. Despite buying the castle and estates from his brother, his finances were also pretty shaky. In 1795 he sold a tract of 33 Juchart to pay off a 9000 Bernese Pound debt. In 1798 he sold another tract of land to pay off an additional 8000 Pound debt. In the same year, following the 1798 French invasion, the old landowners lost their right to personally own villages and lost the Zwing und Bann right. Riggisberg village became part of the Helvetic Republic district of Seftigen under Bern. The Erlachs only retained ownership to the castle and its associated lands. In 1800 he sold the castle and lands to Karl Friedrich Steiger. The following year, Karl Albrecht Ferdinand von Erlach died after falling off a ladder at the family castle in Spiez. The Steiger family opposed the new Helvetic Republic and Karl Friedrich stayed in Prussian controlled Neuch√¢tel while plotting the overthrow of the new Republic. The weak Republic government was unable to enforce its will and finally collapsed in 1802. Karl Friedrich joined the Committee that managed the country until the Act of Mediation in 1803. Switzerland remained a vassal state of the French Republic until Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Karl Friedrich Steiger became a Bernese Senator, an office that he held until his retirement in 1826. After retiring he spent his summers at Riggisberg Castle until he sold it to his youngest son Franz Georg von Steiger in 1830. On 31 August 1832, weapons and ammunition were discovered at the Erlacherhof, which had been stockpiled by the \\"Council of the Sevens\\" who planned to overthrow the reform-minded government. Franz Georg von Steiger was wrongly suspected as a co-conspirator, arrested and then set free after he paid a fine of fifty francs. In 1869, his cousin, Robert Pigott from Ireland, inherited the estate. About a decade later, in 1880, he sold the castles to the Canton of Bern, who converted it into a poorhouse. In 1965-70 the new castle was renovated and converted into a district administration building.

Rantzau was killed by a Swedish cannonball on 11 November. Danish commander Franz Brockenhuus and Swedish commander Bo Birgersson Grip were also killed in the battle. Background After Swedish king Eric XIV was deposed in 1568, his brother became king as John III. John sent a delegation to Denmark to negotiate for an end of the Northern Seven Years' War.Roberts (1968), p. 251. Frederik II of Denmark was unable to exploit the inner-Swedish conflict, as his treasures were emptied by the costs of his German mercenary armies, on whom he had relied throughout the war,Roberts (1968), p. 250. and the rebuilding of the Danish navy.Frost (2000), p. 35. The Swedish delegation in Roskilde consented to all Danish demands. The Dano-Swedish treaty thus included the restoration of the pre-war borders between the kingdoms, except for the Swedish dominion in Estonia, established in 1561 during the Livonian War, which was to be ceded to Frederick's brother, Magnus of Holstein. Furthermore, the Swedish crown was obliged to pay for the Danish war costs from 1563 to 1568. The draft was signed on 18 November 1568 by the Swedish envoys J√∂ren Ericksson Gyllensterne (J√∂rgen Gyldenstiern of Fouglevig), Ture Bielke (Thure Bielcke of Salestad) and Niels Jensson (secretary), and for the Danish side by Peer Oxsse (Per or Peder Oxe of Gisselfeld, hofmester), Johan Friis (Frijs of Hesselagger, chancellor), Holger Rossenkrantzs (Holger Ottesen Rosenkrantz of Boller, governor in North Jutland), Peder Billde (Bilde of Svanholm, commander of Callundborg) and Nils Kaass (Kaas of Taarupgaard, secretary).Odhner et al.

Nabil has published more than 1,000 articles short stories, essays and poems. He is the writer and director of 120 short, experimental and documentary works and 12 feature-length films including The Extras and The Leopard. He has more than 60 awards at international film festivals, including several lifetime achievement awards. Several of his films are in the curriculum of international film schools and he has taught film direction, acting, writing and aesthetics at many universities, centers and associations, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California in Los Angeles. Early life Maleh was born into an upper middle class Damascus family. When Nabil was 14 years old he used to write political articles for local newspapers. Later at 16 years, he went to Czech Republic to study nuclear physics. However, he immediately fell in love with film industry when he was asked to be an extra in a film; so he went to study in Prague Film School (FAMU), whose students then included Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel. While a student he was working at the Arab Radio Transmission, an Arabic language Czech station aimed at the Middle East. Nabil's school years were full of cultural inspiration: ‚ÄúIn addition to the technical side and high artistic standards, FAMU created and developed a very sophisticated cultural base for the filmmaker. Culture was a part of daily life‚Äîa daily event‚Äîa new book, play, concert, an engaging debate. And everything was accessible. It is the only place I found where culture was free of charge. I lived for one month in Prague for what a concert with bad seats would have cost in Paris.‚Äù He finished school and returned home in 1964, but in a year he went abroad again. Director's career After graduation in 1964 and returning to Syria, Maleh was proclaimed as the first European film graduate in his native country. He was invited in a new established National Film Organization in order to control and direct one of organization's first feature films. Maleh wrote a scenario based on Syrian author Haydar Haydar‚Äôs novel The Leopar. A week before shooting was scheduled to begin, the Ministry of Interior banned the film from being shown. Only in 1971 was the film released in rent and Maleh became popular. ‚ÄúThe Leopard‚Äù had a big success and introduced Syrian cinema to the global stage. Maleh shot many films about war in Palestine and Vietnam. The film Labor was banned in Syria because it had a negative portrayal of a government figure. In 1979 was Maleh's second film Fragments. Despite the film's success, the director's relationship with the Syrian government went downhill. He left Syria for the United States, where he taught film production at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California, Los Angeles on a Fulbright Grant. He spent the next 10 years in Europe, mostly in Greece, continuing to write. In 1992, Syria's National Film Organization invited him back to direct the film in Damascus to direct his next major work The Extras. With his production company Ebla ‚Äî named for a Bronze Age fount of Syrian civilization ‚Äî Maleh produced several documentaries for foreign markets, including A Bedouin Day, narrated in English and distributed in Europe by a British company. Continuing to write, he produced a screenplay, a political thriller about an escaped Iraqi official hiding among tourists in Lebanon. The film Hunt Feast was shot in 2005 as a Syrian-British joint venture, but remains locked in a legal battle. The following year the Dubai International Film Festival honored Maleh, along with American director Oliver Stone and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, for his outstanding contribution to cinema. Films Nabil Maleh became the father of Syrian cinematography, he was not only director, but also a scriptwriter and producer. His works were appreciated in the World community. His first film Family Problem (1964) had duration of 35 minutes and premiere took its place in Prague. After that film, Nabil Maleh created three more works that were sponsored by Syrian TV, A Surprise, Dreams, and Two Man and Woman. All of films lasted for 70 minutes. Through his films, Nabil Maleh was reacting at modern issues such as Palestinian conflict or Vietnam War. Napalm (1970) was Maleh's reaction to the injustice taking place in Vietnam and Palestine. The director always tried to go along with modern problems, and influence of 'outside' issues always could be seen in his works. For example, short documentary film Rocks (1970) was created in order to show hard conditions of quarry workers. The most influential film was made in 1970, Men Under the Sun, where Nabil Maleh expressed struggle of Palestinian people. The director's most productive period was in the 1970s. During this decade, Nabil Maleh created a name for himself in global society. The Leopard (1972) brought fame to Mr. Maleh. For the filming of The Leopard the director received the Locarno International Film Festival‚Äôs Special Prize. In this film Mr. Maleh expressed confrontations between feudal system in Syria and rivals. In 1981 Nabil Maleh left Syria, and, after 10 years, he produced one of the most popular films of his filmography: The Extra (1993). In this film, Nabil Maleh raised the common issue of relationships between men and woman, that was very sharp in Syria. When young man and widow try to be with each other, it face the condemnation from society. Documentaries Along with the harsh films, Nabil Maleh was working on a number of documentaries that were expressing different issues in Gulf countries. The documentary A Bedouin Day (1981) could be the best example of Mr. Maleh's close familiarity with the outside world, and the speed with which he responded to different events. A Bedouin Day is a response to the West's portrayal of Arab people. The documentary shows how difficult life is for Bedouins. The Holy Crystal (2008) is a short 26-minute documentary describing Syrian society consisting of Muslim and Christian people. Documentary describes how such a neighborhood influence Syrian economic and cultural life. The theme of relationships between Muslim and Christian people in Syria was close to Nabil Maleh. In the same year, 2008, the director was also inspired to film Damascene Bouquet that lasted for 13 minutes. In this short documentary there is a lot of meaning. Documentary describes rare event that took place in 2006: Christmas coincided with Muslim Eid. These are the main celebrations in both religions, and Nabil Maleh demonstrated how two communities were working together in order to celebrate. While the West was trying to portray Arab communities negatively, Nabil Maleh was trying to bring to light the truth over religion question.

It was originally termed for the early progressive rock of the 1960s. Some stylistic features of progressive pop include hooks and earworms, unorthodox or colorful instrumentation, changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. The movement started as a byproduct of the mid-1960s economic boom, when record labels began investing in artists and allowing performers limited control over their own content and marketing. Groups who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas and oriental melodies ultimately influenced the creation of progressive rock (or \\"prog\\"). When prog records began declining in sales, some artists returned to a more accessible sound that remained commercially appealing until the 1990s. Definition and scope =Characteristics= The term \\"progressive\\" refers to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formulas through methods such as extended instrumentation, personalized lyrics, and individual improvisation. Treblezines Ryan Reed acknowledged that the genre \\"sounds like an oxymoron\\" and is difficult to discern from other genres \\"without squinting\\". He explained that such \\"elusiveness is what makes 'prog-pop' a slippery term\\", although the genre is definable to a set of characteristics which follow: Similar to rock and roll, the tonal structure of progressive pop overthrows harmony as its basic organizing structure. However, unlike rock and roll, progressive pop inverts received conventions, playing with them ironically, disrupting them, or producing shadows of them in new and unexpected forms. Some stylistic features include changes in key and rhythm or experiments with larger forms. Electronic techniques such as echo, feedback, stereo, loudness, and distortion may be used to give the music the impression of space and lateral extension. =Early uses= \\"Progressive pop\\" was originally the usual term for progressive rock music. The latter genre was influenced by the \\"progressive\\" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies, and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The genre's initial premise involved popular music that was created with the intention of listening, not dancing, and opposed the influence of managers, agents, or record companies. In general, progressive music was produced by the performing artists themselves. In December 1966, Melody Maker attempted to define the recent developments in pop. In this article, titled \\"Progressive Pop\\", Chris Welch categorised artists using terms previously associated with jazz; in the most advanced of these, \\"Avant-Garde\\", he placed the Beatles, Cream, Love, the Mothers of Invention, Pink Floyd and Soft Machine, while \\"Modern\\", the next category, comprised the Byrds, Donovan and the Small Faces. After the release of the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between \\"pop\\" and \\"rock\\", thus eliminating the \\"roll\\" from \\"rock and roll\\" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained \\"rock\\" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from \\"radio friendly\\" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective \\"progressive\\" for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson. In 1970, a Melody Maker journalist described progressive pop as music appealing to the masses, but less disposable than the \\"six weeks in the charts and the 'forget it' music of older pop forms.\\" By the late 1970s, \\"progressive pop\\" was roughly synonymous with \\"rock music\\". Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt define progressive pop in the 1970s and 1980s as a \\"leaner breed of pomp rock\\" that was derivative of the Beatles. Producer Alan Parsons, who worked as an engineer on the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), remembered that even though he considered some of his songs \\"pure pop\\", others continued to categorize his band (the Alan Parsons Project) under the \\"progressive rock\\" label. Parsons thought \\"progressive pop\\" was a better name, explaining that \\"what made [our music] progressive was the epic sound and the orchestration which very few people were doing that at the time.\\" Evolution and popularity =1960s: Origins= The Beatles working in the studio with their producer George Martin, circa 1964 During the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word \\"progressive\\" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a \\"progression\\" from the last. The Beach Boys and the Beatles were among the earliest progenitors of progressive pop via albums such as Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper's, respectively. Author Bill Martin recognises the bands as the most significant contributors to the development of progressive rock, transforming rock from dance music into music that was made for listening to. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers. Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, musicologist Walter Everett identifies the Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul as a work that was \\"made more to be thought about than danced to\\", and an album that \\"began a far-reaching trend\\" in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. In mid-1966, the UK release of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds was accompanied by advertisements in the local music press saying that it was \\"The Most Progressive Pop Album Ever!\\" Clevelands Troy Smith believes that the album \\"established the group as forefathers of progressive pop, right from the beginning chords of 'Wouldn't It Be Nice', a Wall of Sound style single\\". In October, Pet Sounds was followed by the psychedelic and elaborately arranged single \\"Good Vibrations\\". According to Reed, the song became the \\"most obvious starting point\\" in the genre. The Beatles' Paul McCartney intimated in 1967: \\"we [the band] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came [Bob] Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing.\\" In the opinion of author Simon Philo, the Beatles' progressive pop was exemplified in the double A-sided single \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" / \\"Penny Lane\\" (1967). In a further example of the reciprocal influences between themselves and the Beach Boys, the Beatles demonstrated \\"paradoxical lyrical content matched by music that was at once 'young' and 'old', rock and Tin Pan Alley, LSD and cocoa, progressive and nostalgic\\" ‚Äì all features that were shared on Sgt. Pepper's. Musicologist Allan Moore writes: \\"At that time, Sgt. Pepper seemed to mark rock music's coming of age ... Now, of course, with jaded memories, we think of it as ushering in an era of pomposity, with varying degrees of seriousness ... The question after 1967 was whether 'progressive' pop/rock was to be trusted, because it was dealing with issues 'deeper' than simply interpersonal relationships. In the long run, the answer turned out to be 'no' (at least, that is, until a later generation of bands discovered the delight of pastiching the Beatles).\\" Towards the end of the 1960s, progressive pop music was received with doubt and disinterest. The Who's Pete Townshend reflected that \\"a lot of psychedelic bullshit was going on\\", referring to \\"garbage\\" being promoted in the charts, and that many artists who were doing ambitious works were instantly being labelled \\"pretentious\\". He believed: \\"Anybody that was any good ... was more or less becoming insignificant again.\\" In 1969, writer Nik Cohn reported that the pop music industry had been split \\"roughly eighty percent ugly and twenty percent idealist\\", with the eighty percent being \\"mainline pop\\" and the twenty percent being \\"progressive pop [developed to] an esoteric feel\\". He predicted that in ten years, the genre would be called by another name (possibly \\"electric music\\"), and that its relationship to pop music would be similar to the one between art movies and Hollywood. While progressive pop did not \\"shrink to a minority cult\\", as Cohn wrote one year later, \\"in England, I wasn't entirely wrong ... But, in America, I fluffed completely ‚Äì the Woodstock nation has kept growing and, for all his seriousness and pretensions to poetry, someone like James Taylor has achieved the same mass appeal as earlier stars.\\" =1970s= ELO performing in 1986. Frontman Jeff Lynne was one of prog-pop's \\"signature architects\\". Progressive rock (also known as art rock) was ushered in the 1970s, directly following the combination of classical grandiosity and pop experimentalism from the 1960s. Although it reached widespread popularity, from 1976 onward, the genre declined in sales and was played with less frequency on FM radio. According to Breithaupt and Breithaupt, this created a vacuum for \\"a host of new, milder 'serious' bands, whose humor (Queen), pop smarts (Supertramp), and style (Roxy Music, mach two) would ensure their survival into the eighties. ... they met the melodic requirements of AM radio while still producing thoughtful, original work.\\" Bands like Queen and Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) played a type of progressive pop that was grounded in prog-rock without compromising their chart success. Reed cited ELO's \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" as the \\"definitive statement\\" by ELO's Jeff Lynne, who \\"infus[ed] the Beatles‚Äô kaleidoscopic post-Peppers sing-alongs with symphonic grandeur.\\" The Buggles' Geoff Downes, who considered his band to be a continuation of ELO and 10cc's progressive traditions, says: \\"Those early 10cc records such as [1973 debut] 10cc and Sheet Music were pretty out there, and Godley & Creme took that even further. Even Abba had sections in their music that were quite intricate. We loved all that studio trickery and experimentation.

By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount of control over the creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the prog-rock style had ceased to exist. Some mainstream pop acts, such as Tears for Fears, continued the traditions of prog-pop. In 1985, Simon Reynolds noted that the New Pop movement attempted to \\"bridge\\" the divide between \\"progressive\\" pop and its mass/chart counterpart, describing their general relationship as \\"one between boys and girls, middle- class and working-class.\\" In 2008, The New York Times John Wray discussed \\"the return of the one-man band\\", observing a recent progressive pop trend that involved large bands or collectives \\"with a disdain for clearly defined hierarchies\\", noting examples such as Arcade Fire, Broken Social Scene, and Animal Collective.

During most of the 12th and 13th centuries, its history is chiefly that of the gradual reconquest of territory from the various Muslim principalities (taifas) of the period. This process was essentially complete with the ascension of Afonso III of Portugal, the first to claim the title of King of Portugal and the Algarve. The history of Portugal in the period between the death of Afonso III in 1279 and the beginning of the Portuguese Empire in 1415 includes the 1383‚Äì1385 Portuguese interregnum and the subsequent transition from the Portuguese House of Burgundy to the House of Aviz. Background Towards the close of the 11th century crusading knights came from every part of Europe to aid the kings of Le√≥n, Castile and Aragon in fighting the Moors. Among these adventurers was Henry of Burgundy, who, in 1095, married Teresa of Le√≥n, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. The County of Portugal was included in Teresa's dowry. Count Henry ruled as a vassal of Alfonso VI, whose Galician marches were thus secured against any sudden Moorish raid. But in 1109 Alfonso VI died, bequeathing all his territories to his legitimate daughter, Urraca of Le√≥n, and Count Henry at once invaded Le√≥n, hoping to add it to his own dominions at the expense of his suzerain. After three years of war against Urraca and other rival claimants to the throne of Le√≥n, Count Henry himself died in 1112, leaving his widow Teresa to govern Portugal north of the Mondego during the minority of her infant son, Afonso Henriques: south of the Mondego. Teresa renewed the struggle against her half-sister and suzerain Urraca in 1116‚Äì1117, and again in 1120; in 1121 she was besieged in Lanhoso and captured. But a peace was negotiated by the archbishops Diego Gelm√≠rez and Burdino of Braga, rival churchmen whose wealth and military resources enabled them to dictate terms. Bitter jealousy existed between the two prelates, each claiming to be primate \\"of all Hispania\\", and their antagonism had some historical importance insofar as it fostered the growth of separatist tendencies among the Portuguese. But the quarrel was temporarily suspended because both Gelmires and Burdino, virtually princes within their territories, had reason to dread the extension of Urraca's authority. It was arranged that Teresa should be liberated and should continue to hold the county of Portugal as a fief of Le√≥n. During the next five years she lavished wealth and titles upon her lover, Fernando P√©rez de Traba, count of Trava, thus estranging her son, the archbishop of Braga and the nobles. Meanwhile, her son Afonso Henriques (meaning \\"Afonso son of Henry\\") thrived. The boy, probably born around 1109, followed his father as Count of Portugal in 1112, under the tutelage of his mother. The relations between Teresa and her son Afonso proved difficult. Only eleven years old, Afonso already had his own political ideas, greatly different from his mother's. In 1120, the young prince took the side of the archbishop of Braga, a political foe of Teresa, and both were exiled by her orders. Afonso spent the next years away from his own county, under the watch of the bishop. In 1122 Afonso became fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. He made himself a knight on his own account in Zamora Cathedral, raised an army, and proceeded to take control of his lands. Near Guimar√£es, at the Battle of S√£o Mamede (1128) he overcame the troops under his mother's lover and ally, Count Fernando P√©rez de Traba, making her his prisoner and exiling her forever to a monastery in Le√≥n. She died there in 1130. Thus Afonso become sole ruler (Duke of Portugal) after demands for independence from the county's people, church and nobles. He also vanquished Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile, his nominal suzerain, and thus freed the county from political dependence on the crown of Le√≥n. On April 6, 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal. Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on July 25, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Le√≥n, but an independent kingdom in its own right. That he then convened the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm the independence) is likely to be a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history. Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal still had to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most importantly, by the Catholic Church and the Pope. Afonso wed Matilda of Savoy, daughter of Amadeus III, Count of Savoy, and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile or Le√≥n, Afonso declared himself the direct vassal of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santar√©m and Lisbon in 1147. He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years. Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII, Afonso's cousin, regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. The conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Alfonso VII. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce, sister of the Count of Barcelona and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Le√≥n that Portugal was an independent kingdom. Afonso was occupied in almost incessant border fighting against his Christian or Moorish neighbours. Twelve years of campaigning on the Galician frontier were concluded in 1143 by the Treaty of Zamora, in which Afonso was recognized as independent of any other Iberian sovereign, although he promised to be a faithful vassal of the Pope and to pay him a yearly tribute of four ounces of gold. In 1167, however, the war was renewed. Afonso succeeded in conquering part of Galicia, but in attempting to capture the frontier fortress of Badajoz he was wounded and forced to surrender to Ferdinand II of Le√≥n (1169). Ferdinand was his son-in-law and was probably disposed to leniency by the imminence of a Moorish invasion in which Portugal could render useful assistance. Afonso was therefore released under a promise to abandon all his conquests in Galicia. In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the papal bull Manifestis Probatum, Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Leonese attempts at annexation. In 1184, in spite of his great age, King Afonso of Portugal still had sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santar√©m by the Moors. He died shortly after, on December 6, 1185. Reconquista in Portugal Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula in 1157 Afonso had already won many victories over the Moors. At the beginning of his reign the religious fervor which had sustained the Almoravid dynasty was rapidly subsiding; in Portugal independent Moorish chiefs ruled over cities and petty taifa states, ignoring the central government; in Africa the Almohades were destroying the remnants of the Almoravide power. Afonso took advantage of these dissentions to invade Alentejo, reinforced by the Templars and the Knights Hospitaller, whose respective headquarters were at Tomar and Soure. On July 25, 1139 he defeated the combined forces of the Moors on the plains of Ourique, in Alentejo.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 60. Legend has magnified the victory into the rout of 200,000 Muslims under five kings; but so far was the battle from being decisive that in 1140 the Moors were able to seize the fortress of Leiria, built by Afonso in 1135 as an outpost for the defence of Coimbra, his capital. In 1144 they defeated the Templars at Soure. But on March 15, 1147 Afonso stormed the fortress of Santar√©m,Ribeiro 2004a, p. 69. and about the same time a band of crusaders on their way to Palestine landed at Porto on 16 June 1147, and volunteered for the impending siege of Lisbon. Among them were many \\"Franks\\" from France, England, Flanders and German states, who were afterwards induced to settle in Portugal. Aided by these powerful allies, Afonso captured Lisbon on October 24, 1147.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 70. This was the greatest military achievement of his reign. The Moorish garrisons of Palmela, Sintra and Almada soon capitulated, and in 1158 Alc√°cer do Sal, one of the chief centres of Moorish commerce, was taken by storm.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 71. At this time, however, the Almohad Caliphate had triumphed in Africa and invaded the Iberian Peninsula, where they were able to check the Portuguese reconquest, although isolated bands of crusading adventurers succeeded in establishing themselves in various cities of Alentejo. The most famous of these free-lancers was Gerald the Fearless, who captured √âvora in 1165.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 75. In 1171 Afonso concluded a seven years truce with the Moors; weakened by his wound and by old age, he could no longer take the field, and when the war broke out afresh he delegated the chief command to his son Sancho. Between 1179 and 1184 the Moors retrieved many of their losses in Alentejo, but were unable to retake Santar√©m and Lisbon. In 1179, by the papal bull Manifestis Probatum, Pope Alexander III acknowledged Portugal as an independent nation and Afonso and his heirs as her rightful kings.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 77. Afonso died on December 6, 1185. He had secured for Portugal both the status and the name of an independent kingdom, and had extended its frontier southwards from the Mondego to the Tagus. He had laid the foundation of its navy and had strengthened, if he did not inaugurate, that system of co-operation between the Crown and the military orders which afterwards proved of incalculable service in the maritime and colonial development of the nation. Sancho I continued the war against the Moors with varying fortune. In 1189 he won Silves, then the capital of Algarve; in 1192 he lost not only Algarve but the greater part of Alentejo, including Alc√°cer do Sal, to the Almohads. A peace was then arranged. For the next eight years, Sancho was engaged in hostilities against Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. The motives and course of this indecisive struggle are obscure. It ended in 1201, and the last decade of Sancho's reign was a period of peaceful reform which earned for the king his popular name of o Povoador, \\"the Populator\\". He granted fresh charters to many cities, legalizing the system of self- government which the Romans had bequeathed to the Visigoths and the Moors had retained or improved. Lisbon had already (1179) received a charter from Afonso I. Sancho also endeavoured to foster immigration and agriculture, by granting estates to the military orders and municipalities on condition that the occupiers should cultivate or colonize their lands. Towards the close of his reign he became embroiled in a dispute with Pope Innocent III. He had insisted that priests should accompany their flocks in battle, had made them amenable to secular jurisdiction, had withheld the tribute due to Rome and had even claimed the right of disposing of ecclesiastical domains. Finally he had quarreled with Martinho Rodrigues, the unpopular bishop of Porto, who was besieged for five months in his palace and then forced to seek redress in Rome (1209). As Sancho was in weak health and had no means of resisting Papal pressure, he made full submission (1210); and after bestowing large estates on his sons and daughters, he retired into Alcoba√ßa Monastery, where he died in March 1211.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 91. Afonso II The reign of Afonso II is noteworthy for the first meeting of the Portuguese Cortes, to which the upper hierarchy of the Church and the nobles (fidalgos and ricos homens) were summoned by royal writ. The king (1211‚Äì1223), was no warrior, but in 1212 a Portuguese contingent aided the Castilians to defeat the Moors in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, and in 1217 the ministers, bishops and captains of the realm, reinforced by foreign crusaders, retook Alc√°cer do Sal.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 111. Afonso II repudiated the will of his father, refused to surrender the estates left to his brothers, who went into exile, and only gave up the property bequeathed to his sisters after a prolonged civil war in which Alfonso IX of Le√≥n took part against them. Even then he compelled the heiresses to take the veil. His attempts to strengthen the monarchy and fill the treasury at the expense of the Church resulted in his excommunication by Pope Honorius III, and Portugal remained under interdict until Afonso II died on 25 March 1223.Ribeiro 2004a, p. 115. Sancho II Sancho II succeeded at the age of thirteen. To secure the removal of the interdict the leading statesmen who were identified with the policy of his father Gon√ßalo Mendes the chancellor, Pedro Annes, the lord chamberlain (), and Vicente, dean of Lisbon, resigned their offices. Est√™v√£o Soares, archbishop of Braga, placed himself at the head of the nobles and churchmen who threatened to usurp the royal power during Sancho II's minority, and negotiated an alliance with Alfonso IX, by which it was arranged that the Portuguese should attack Elvas, the Castilians Badajoz. Elvas was taken from the Moors in 1226, and in 1227 Sancho assumed control of the kingdom. He reinstated Pedro Annes, made Vicente chancellor, and appointed Martim Annes chief standard-bearer (alferes mor), i.e., the chief military official. He continued the crusade against the Moors, who were driven from their last strongholds in Alentejo, and in 1239‚Äì1244, after a dispute with Rome which was once more ended by the imposition of an interdict and the submission of the Portuguese ruler, he won many successes in the Algarve. But his career of conquest was cut short by a revolution (1245), for which his marriage to a Castilian lady, M√©cia Lopes de Haro, furnished a pretext. The legitimacy of the union has been questioned, on grounds which appear insufficient; but of its unpopularity there can be no doubt. The bishops, resenting the favour shown by Sancho to his father's anti-clerical ministers, took advantage of this unpopularity to organize the rebellion. They found a leader in Sancho's brother Afonso, count of Boulogne, who owed his title to a marriage with Matilda, countess of Boulogne. The pope issued a bull of deposition in favour of Afonso, who reached Lisbon in 1246; and after a civil war lasting two years Sancho II retired to Toledo, where he died in January 1248.Ribeiro 2004b, p. 8. Afonso III One of the first acts of the usurper, and one of the most important, was to abandon the semi-ecclesiastical titles of visitor () or defender () of the realm, and to proclaim himself king. Hitherto the position of the monarchy had been precarious; as in Aragon the nobles and the church had exercised a large measure of control over their nominal head, and though it would be pedantry to over-emphasize the importance of the royal title, its assumption by Afonso III does mark a definite stage in the evolution of a national monarchy and a centralized government. A second stage was reached shortly afterwards by the conquest of Algarve, the last remaining stronghold of the Moors. This drew down upon Portugal the anger of Alfonso X of Castile, surnamed the Wise, who claimed suzerainty over Algarve. The war which followed was ended by Afonso III consenting to wed Beatriz de Guzm√°n, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X, and to hold Algarve as a fief of Castile. The celebration of this marriage, while Matilda, countess of Boulogne and first wife of Afonso III, was still alive, entailed the imposition of an interdict upon the kingdom. In 1254 Afonso III summoned cortes to Leiria, in which the chief cities were represented, as well as the nobles and clergy.Ribeiro 2004b, p. 15. Fortified by their support the king refused to submit to Rome. At the cortes of Coimbra (1261), he further strengthened his position by conciliating the representatives of the cities, who denounced the issue of a debased coinage, and by recognizing that taxation could not be imposed without consent of the cortes. The clergy suffered more than the laity under a prolonged interdict, and in 1262 Pope Urban IV legalized the disputed marriage and legitimized Dinis (future king Dinis), the king's eldest son. Thus ended the contest for supremacy between Church and Crown. The monarchy owed its triumph to its championship of national interests, to the support of the municipalities and military orders, and to the prestige gained by the royal armies in the Moorish and Castilian wars. In 1263 Alfonso X renounced his claim to suzerainty over the Kingdom of the Algarve.Ribeiro 2004b, p. 14. Lisbon was henceforth recognized as the capital. Afonso III continued to reign until his death on 16 February 1279,Ribeiro 2004b, p. 21. but the peace of his later years was broken by the rebellion (1277‚Äì1279) of Dinis. King Dinis I of Portugal Dinis I The chief problems now confronting the monarchy were no longer military, but social, economic and constitutional. The reign of Denis was not a period of uninterrupted peace. At the outset his legitimacy was disputed by his brother Afonso, and a brief civil war ensued. Hostilities between Portugal and the reunited kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile were terminated in 1297 by a treaty of alliance, in accordance with which Ferdinand IV of Castile married Constance, daughter of Dinis, while Afonso, son of Denis, married Beatrice of Castile, daughter of Ferdinand. A further outbreak of civil war, between the king and the heir-apparent, was averted in 1293 by the queen-consort Elizabeth of Portugal, who had married Denis in 1281, and was canonized for her many virtues in the 16th century. She rode between the hostile camps, and succeeded in arranging an honourable peace between her husband and her son. These wars were too brief to interfere seriously with the social reconstruction to which the king devoted himself. At his accession the Portuguese people was not homogeneous; it was a long process in which its component peoples \\"Moors and Mozarabs of the south, Galicians of the north, Jews and foreign crusaders\\" would be fused into one nationality. King Denis ordered the construction of numerous castles, created new towns, and granted privileges due cities to several others. The process of settlement of the south and some parts of the interior by northern Portuguese, carried out by his predecessors, had a great development in his reign and the new lands were populated. There were also urgent economic problems to be solved. The Moors had made Alentejo the granary of Portugal, but war had undone their work, and large tracts of land were now barren and depopulated. Commerce and education had similarly been subordinated to the struggle for national existence. The machinery of administration was out of date and complicated by the authority of feudal and ecclesiastical courts. The supremacy of the Crown, though recognized, was still unstable. It was Denis who initiated the needful reforms. He earned his title of the rei lavrador or \\"farmer king\\" by introducing improved methods of cultivation and founding agricultural schools. He encouraged maritime trade by negotiating a commercial treaty with England (1294) and forming a royal navy (1317) under the command of a Genoese admiral named Emanuele Pessagno (Manuel Pessanha). In 1290 he founded the University of Coimbra, which began its existence in Lisbon and was transferred to Coimbra in 1308 and moved definitively in 1537. He was a poet and a patron of literature and music, proclaiming Portuguese to be the language of the state. His chief administrative reforms were designed to secure centralized government and to limit the jurisdiction of feudal courts. He encouraged and nationalized the military orders. In 1290 the Portuguese knights of the Order of Santiago were definitely separated from the parent Castilian order. The Knights Hospitaller in Portugal and the Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz had already been established, the traditional dates of their incorporation being 1113 and 1162. After the condemnation of the Templars by Pope Clement V (1312) an ecclesiastical commission investigated the charges against the Portuguese branch of the order, and found in its favour. As the Templars were rich, influential and loyal, Denis took advantage of the death of Clement V. to maintain the order under a new name; the Order of Christ, as it was henceforth called, received the benediction of the pope in 1319 and subsequently played an important part in the colonial expansion of Portugal. Afonso IV Afonso IV adhered to the matrimonial policy initiated by Dinis. He arranged that his daughter Maria should wed Alfonso XI of Castile (1328), but the marriage precipitated the war it was intended to avert, and peace was only restored (1330) after Queen Isabella had again intervened. Peter, the heir, afterwards married Constance, daughter of the duke of Pe√±afiel (near Valladolid), and Afonso IV brought a strong Portuguese army to aid the Castilians against the Moors of Granada and their African allies. In the victory won by the Christians on the banks of the river Salado, near Tarifa, he earned his title of Afonso the Brave (1340). In 1347 he gave his daughter Eleanor in marriage to Peter IV of Aragon. The later years of his reign were darkened by the tragedy of In√™s de Castro. He died in 1357. Pedro I Ferdinand I of Portugal Pedro's particular fancy was the administration of justice, which he frequently did in person and with considerable cruelty. The first act of Pedro I of Portugal, was to take vengeance on the murderers of In√™s de Castro. Throughout his reign he strengthened the central government at the expense of the aristocracy and the Church, by a stern enforcement of law and order. In 1361, at the Cortes of Elvas, it was enacted that the privileges of the clergy should only be deemed valid insofar as they did not conflict with the royal prerogative. Pedro maintained friendly relations with England, where in 1352 Edward III issued a proclamation in favour of Portuguese traders, and in 1353 the Portuguese envoy Afonso Martins Alho signed a covenant with the merchants of London, guaranteeing mutual good faith in all commercial dealings. The foreign policy of Denis, Afonso IV and Pedro I had been, as in rule, successful in its main object, the preservation of peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia; in consequence, the Portuguese had advanced in prosperity and culture. They had supported the monarchy because it was a national institution, hostile to the tyranny of nobles and clergy. During the reign of Ferdinand (1367‚Äì1383) and under the regency of Leonora the ruling dynasty ceased to represent the national will; the Portuguese people therefore made an end of the dynasty and chose its own ruler. The complex events which brought about this crisis may be briefly summarized. Ferdinand I Ferdinand I, claimed the thrones of Le√≥n and Castile, left vacant by the death of King Peter of Castile (1369); he based his claim on the fact that his grandmother Beatrice (1367‚Äì1385) belonged to the legitimate line of Castile. When the majority of the Castilian nobles refused to accept a Portuguese sovereign, and welcomed Henry II of Castile, Ferdinand allied himself with the Moors and Aragonese; but in 1371 Pope Gregory XI intervened, and it was decided that Ferdinand should renounce his claim and marry Eleanor, the daughter of his successful rival. Ferdinand, however, preferred his Portuguese mistress, Leonor Telles de Menezes, whom he eventually married. To avenge this slight, Henry of Castile invaded Portugal and besieged Lisbon. Ferdinand appealed to John of Gaunt, who also claimed the throne of Castile, on behalf of his wife, Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of Peter of Castile. An alliance between Portugal and England was concluded; and although Ferdinand made peace with Castile in 1374, he renewed his claim in 1380, after the death of Henry of Castile, and sent Jo√£o Fernandes Andeiro, count of Our√©m, to secure English aid. In 1381 Richard II of England despatched a powerful force to Lisbon, and betrothed his cousin Prince Edward to Beatrice, only child of Ferdinand, who had been recognized as heiress to the throne by the Cortes of Leiria (1376). In 1383, Ferdinand made peace with John I of Castile at Salvaterra, deserting his English allies, who retaliated by ravaging part of his territory. By the Treaty of Salvaterra it was agreed that Beatrice should marry John I. Six months later Ferdinand died, and in accordance with the terms of the treaty Leonora became regent until the eldest son of John I and Beatrice should be of age. Portuguese Interregnum Leonora had long carried on a relationship with the count of Our√©m, who engaged in various intrigues with England and Castile, and whose influence was resented by the leaders of the aristocracy, while her tyrannical rule also aroused Rebellion of bitter opposition. The malcontents chose D. John, 1383. grand-master of the knights of Aviz and illegitimate son of Pedro the Severe, as their leader, organized a revolt in Lisbon, and assassinated the count of Our√©m within the royal palace (December 6, 1383). Leonora fled to Santar√©m and summoned aid from Castile, while D. John was proclaimed defender of Portugal. In 1384 a Castilian army invested Lisbon, but encountered a heroic resistance, and after five months an outbreak of plague compelled them to raise the siege, John I of Castile, discovering or alleging that Leonora had plotted to poison him, imprisoned her in a convent at Tordesillas, where she died in 1386. In 1384, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, future constable of Portugal, defeated the invaders, at the Battle of Atoleiros. John I Jo√£o I On April 16, 1385, Jo√£o das Regras showed at the Cortes assembled in Coimbra that they had the right to choose John of Aviz as their new king. John (or Jo√£o) was then elected king of Portugal. One of the most important events in the history of the Portuguese Cortes was the Cortes of Coimbra, which definitely affirmed the national character of the monarchy. The choice of the grand-master of Aviz ratified the old alliance between the Crown and the military orders; his election by the whole Cortes not only ratified the alliance between the Crown and the commons, but also included the nobles and the Church. Ferdinand had been the last legitimate descendant of Count Henry of Burgundy. With John I began the rule of a new dynasty, the House of Aviz. The most urgent matter which confronted the king or the group of statesmen, led by Jo√£o das Regras and the constable who inspired his policy was the menace of Castilian aggression. John of Castile marched into Portugal with a large army in August 1385. But on August 14, the much-outnumbered Portuguese, aided by 500 English archers, utterly defeated the Castilians and their French allies at Aljubarrota. By this victory the Portuguese showed themselves equal in military power to their strongest rivals in the Peninsula. In October the constable invaded Castile and won another victory at Valverde. Early the next year, John of Gaunt and 5,000 English reinforcements arrived to aid John I. Together they launched another counter-invasion of Castile, but the campaign proved abortive. By the treaty of Windsor (May 9, 1386), the alliance between Portugal and England was confirmed and extended. Against such a combination the Castilians were powerless; Denis, eldest son of In√™s de Castro, claimed the Portuguese throne and invaded Portugal in 1398, but his troops were easily crushed. A treaty was arranged in 1387 and renewed at intervals until peace was concluded with the Treaty of Ayll√≥n, 1411. A depiction of the Battle of Aljubarrota The domestic and foreign policy pursued by John I until his death in 1433 may be briefly described. At home he endeavoured to reform administration, to encourage agriculture and commerce, and to secure the loyalty of the nobles by grants of land and privileges so extensive that, towards the end of his reign, many nobles who exercised their full feudal rights had become almost independent princes. Abroad, he aimed at peace with Castile and close friendship with England. In 1387 he had married Philipa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt; Richard II sent troops to aid in the expulsion of Denis; Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI of England successively ratified the treaty of Windsor; Henry IV made his ally a knight of the Garter in 1400. =Beginning of the Portuguese Empire= The Cortes of Coimbra, the battle of Aljubarrota and the treaty of Windsor mark the three final stages in the consolidation of the monarchy. A period of expansion oversea began in the same reign, with the capture of Ceuta in Morocco. The three eldest sons of King John and Queen Philippa, Edward, Peter and Henry (afterwards celebrated as Henry the Navigator) desired to win knighthood by service against the Moors, the historic enemies of their country and creed. In 1415 a Portuguese fleet, commanded by the king and the three princes, set sail for Ceuta. The town was captured and garrisoned, and thus the first Portuguese outpost was established on the mainland of Africa. Flags of Portugal during the Middle Ages Five different flags were used during the period from 1139 until 1415. As seen below, they evolved over time from a simple blue cross on a white field to a complex design involving a red border with many different shapes.

Pastor's three-act version is set to the same score used in the Prokofiev version of the ballet. The libretto is by Pastor and Willem Bruls. Synopsis Vladimir Yaroshenko and Maria ≈ªuk as Romeo and Juliet, Polish National Ballet, Warsaw The ballet is recast as a contemporary political statement set in three Italian political eras of the 20th century. Act I is set in Italy in the 1930s, during the reign of Benito Mussolini and the emergence of Fascism. (1935 was the year in which Prokofiev composed the original score.) Act II takes place in the 1950s, amid the rise of the Red Brigades and political terrorism. Act III is set in the 1990s during Silvio Berlusconi's tenure of social unrest, which serves as the backdrop for the climatic tragedy. The content of the three acts mirrors the contemporary Italian eras. In the first act, paralleling the rise of Fascism, the upper-class Capulet family is depicted with \\"stiff, militaristic movement\\", while the lower-class Montegue family is characterized by \\"loose, flowing motions laced with pedestrian naturalism\\". In the second act, paralleling the Red Brigades era of political terrorism, the romance of Romeo and Juliet is dogged by interfamilial feuding and conflict. In the third act, paralleling the \\"social divisions\\" of the Berlusconi era, the lovers meet their tragic fate. The work is accompanied by a \\"multimedia video backdrop\\". Performances The ballet was premiered by the Scottish Ballet in 2008 at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. Following its debut, it toured the United Kingdom in 2010, and in the weeks prior to its United States premiere it was performed in the Grand Theatre by the Polish National Ballet. Its United States premiere will be by the Joffrey Ballet at Auditorium Theatre with music performed by the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. The Joffrey had previously performed Cranko's adaptation of Prokofiev multiple times as early as 1984, when it gave the Prokofiev score its United States debut. In 2014, there was also an encore UK touring production that visited Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, London and Glasgow.

It was mainly used for freight traffic. It was opened in 1875, but it lost its importance with the closure of a line connecting to the east as a result of the division of Germany after the Second World War and it is now closed and dismantled. History The Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (, MHE) had been trying to develop a western connection from its network since the 1850s, but had failed as a result of disputes between the Kingdom of Prussia, the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick. In 1864, a treaty was finally contracted between Prussia and Brunswick authorising construction of the Halberstadt‚ÄìVienenburg railway, which was completed in 1869. With the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866, it was possible to extend the line further to the west. Around the same time the Hanover-Altenbeken Railway Company (Hannover-Altenbekener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, HAE) was looking for a connection to the east and the mountain towns in the Upper Harz also wanted a connection to the rail network. So the HAE planned a new long-distance line on the Vienenburg‚ÄìHildesheim‚ÄìHamelin‚ÄìL√∂hne route. The MHE line would build a connection from Vienenburg via Langelsheim to Clausthal. However, in 1873, the HAE ran into financial difficulties, so it was taken over by the MHE. This brought together the two projects aiming at building railways to Vienenburg and instead a line was built to Grauhof, splitting there to run towards Clausthal (the former Innerste Valley Railway) and towards Hildesheim (now part of the Hildesheim‚ÄìGoslar railway). The latter connected in Ringelheim with the Brunswick Southern Railway, which ran to Kreiensen to meet the Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen railway, and to the line between Hanover and Kassel, which connected to western and southern Germany. Freight was carried from L√∂hne to Vienenburg on 19 May 1875 and a passenger service followed on 30 June. The branch from Grauhof via Langelsheim to Lautenthal was open for freight from 25 October and for passengers from 15 November 1875. On 15 September 1877, the line from Langelsheim to Neuekrug-Hahausen was opened, connecting with the Brunswick Southern Railway, which avoided having to go via Ringelsheim to reach Kreiensen. It has since been operated as part of the main line between Vienenburg and Langelsheim. Goslar was at this time connected to the railway network only by the Vienenburg‚ÄìGoslar railway. To improve this situation, two railway lines were built simultaneously into the city from Grauhof and Langelsheim, which were opened on 1 May 1883. Passenger services ran on the route via Goslar, with the ever-increasing freight traffic remaining on the older and less steep line. A medium-sized marshalling yard (now closed) was built in Vienenburg, which was associated with a smaller facility in Grauhof. In 1930, part of a potash mine in Vienenburg voll Wasser collapsed, causing a slump in the ground under the line and requiring repairs to the track, which lasted half a year. With the division of Germany in 1945, this line lost its connection to the east. Now the line via Goslar could handle all traffic and Deutsche Bundesbahn ended services on the Vienenburg‚ÄìLangelsheim line. Conflicting sources indicate traffic ended between 1949 and 1960. A section near Grauhof still operated as an industrial siding until the end of the 1990s, when it was finally disconnected. Today the line is dismantled, but embankments and a bridge can still be found. The Hildesheim‚ÄìGoslar railway still performs a tight turn at the former railway junction in Grauhof.

The festival began in 2003 and is often held in October. It plays host to curated exhibitions across the city of Brighton and Hove in gallery and public spaces. Previous editions have been curated by Jeremy Millar (2003), Gilane Tawadros (2006), Julian Stallabrass (2008), Martin Parr (2010) and Photoworks (2012). Brighton Photo Biennial announced its merger with Photoworks in 2006 and in 2020 its name was changed to Photoworks Festival. Brighton Photo Fringe (BPF) runs in parallel to the Biennial, providing a complimentary series of exhibitions and talks.\\"Brighton Photo Biennial unveils its 2014 programme\\", British Journal of Photography. Accessed 23 July 2014. Organisation The festival began in 2003. It announced its merger with Photoworks in 2006 following a successful Arts Council England National Portfolio funding application that secured the future of the newly merged organisation for three years. The first edition of the Biennial produced under new leadership was BPB12 Agents of Change: Photography and the Politics of Space produced and curated by Photoworks. Festival editions = BPB03 = In 2003 Jeremy Miller became the inaugural curator of the Brighton Photo Biennial. This edition of the festival included exhibitions, Make Life Beautiful! The Dandy in Photography at Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, Parade by Mark Leckey at Fabrica (formerly the Holy Trinity Church, Brighton), The Inconsiderable Things by Rachel Harrison and Peter Fraser at the University of Brighton Gallery, To Be Honest an open submission exhibition at Phoenix Gallery and Untitled by Boris Mikhailov at the Gardner Arts Centre. In addition to the exhibitions, Brighton Photo Biennial 2003 included projects outside of the gallery context. These included a collaboration with Swiss artist Beat Streuli and local newspaper, The Argus, where images by the artist of the city's inhabitants were distributed as a pull-out in the paper over three consecutive Saturdays. Other projects from the festival included Wind Blown Cloud by Alec Finlay, Insight by Patrick Killoran and The London to Brighton Art Car Rally and Boot Sale in collaboration with Vauxhall Motors. The Art Car Rally and Boot Sale has continued to beyond the Brighton Photo Biennial festival and has now been running annually since 2004. = BPB06 = Curated by Gilane Tawadros (now a Trustee of Photoworks). Gilane's vision of the BPB presented a mix of historic and contemporary photography through exhibitions of artworks and shows from Adel Abdessemed, Richard Avedon, Phyllis Baldino, David Claerbout, William Eggleston, Walker Evans, Paul Fusco, Alfredo Jaar, Gabriel Kuri, Van Leo, Glenn Ligon, Steve McQueen, Lee Miller, Richard Misrach, Henna Nadeem, Mitra Tabrizian, Fiona Tan, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol and Orson Welles. The Henna Nadeem exhibition, A Picture Book of Britain led to the Photoworks publication of the same name with text by David Chandler and Dr Benedict Burbridge. = BPB08 = Brighton Photo Biennial 2008 entitled Memory of Fire: The War of Images and Images of War was curated by renown British art historian Julian Stallabrass and explored the representation, saturation, use and currency of images of modern conflict. The festival, named after Eduardo Galeano's publication of the same name, saw ten exhibitions exploring the theme from a wide variety of artists, citizen journalists, the media and public. Stallabrass' edition of the festival saw it extend beyond the city of Brighton and Hove to nearby regions of Chichester, Winchester, Eastbourne, Hastings and Portsmouth. These exhibitions included Agent Orange at Pallant House Gallery with works by Philip Jones Griffiths, Designs for Solidarity at the Design Archives, Iraq Through the Lens of Vietnam at the University of Brighton Gallery, Photographing the First World War at Charleston Farmhouse, Photography & Revolution: Memory Trails through the Latin American Left at The Winchester Gallery, The Sublime Image of Destruction at De La Warr Pavilion, Unveiled: Voices of Women in Afghanistan at Independent Photographers Gallery, War Memorial at Aspex, Why, Mister, Why? and Baghdad Calling at Lighthouse and the controversial The Incommensurable Banner at Fabrica. The Incommensurable Banner received critical acclaim and controversial press during the Brighton Photo Biennial 2008 and in New York where it was exhibited prior to the UK, both locally and nationally for its display of graphic imagery, resulting in the exhibition closing its doors to those under 18 years old. This highly topical edition of the festival led to Stallabrass' revisiting of the works and artists in the 2013 Photoworks publication, Memory of Fire: Images of War and the War of Images which he edited. The book contextualised the exhibitions, talks and works presented in the 2008 Biennial and supplemented them with new works, interviews and critiques. This publication received critical acclaim within the photography industry through reviews in The Art Newspaper, Aperture Online and 1000Words. = BPB10 = 2010 saw the British documentary photographer, Martin Parr take the helm as Curator, titling the edition New Documents - portraying the vibrancy of photography in reflection of the diversity of the city of Brighton & Hove. Photography critic Sean O'Hagan commented in The Guardian that, \\"This year's Brighton Photo Biennial may yet become the model for the great British photo festival of the future\\". In addition to the usual format of exhibitions in and around the city, Parr's BPB again extended the scope of the festival by pitching itself as the UK's first \\"frameless\\" photography festival and commissioning some of the artists to produce site-specific work for the Brighton context. Parr gave his reason for this, ‚ÄúAs curator, I want to make this festival fresh, distinctive and focused on Brighton & Hove. This city is the ideal venue for a Photo Biennial. It has a natural cultural constituency of its own, and its proximity to London promises a potentially huge audience. By presenting the very best new work in an exciting and imaginative way, Brighton Photo Biennial 2010 will continue to put photography in Brighton & Hove on the national and international map.\\". In its fourth edition, the 2010 Biennial's programme of events had also grown to include a larger education and participation strand than previous editions. This led to the inclusion of Brighton's White Night that encouraged the public and artists to engage with photography and light in different and unexpected ways. = BPB12 = The first edition of the Biennial following the merger of BPB with Photoworks, Brighton Photo Biennial 2012, Agents of Change: Photography and the Politics of Space was curated by Photoworks' Director, Celia Davies, and Programme Curator Dr Benedict Burbridge.

The fort is on a bend in the Medway River and played an important role in the protection of southeast Georgia throughout various conflicts beginning in 1741 and ending in 1865 at the conclusion of the American Civil War, including the French and Indian and American Revolutionary Wars and War of 1812. The historic site is in size and sits at an elevation of . On May 13, 1970, the fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places.National Park Service: Fort Morris Today it is a state park, Fort Morris Historic Site. History =French and Indian War= The first fort built at the site was constructed in 1741 to protect a plantation owned by Captain Mark Carr. Carr owned of land in the area that was granted to him by the Georgia Trustees. Carr was the commander of a company of marine rangers in the British Colonial Army from 1732 - 1751. His plantation came under attack on March 18, 1741 by a group of Indians who were allies with the Spanish colonial forces in Florida. Several soldiers defending the fort were killed in the raid and the contents of the fort and plantation were taken away in a large boat that belonged to the plantation. The next fort at the site was constructed in 1756 at the encouragement of locals who were being attacked during uprising of Creek Indians in the era during the French and Indian War. The fort was expanded in 1758 to provide protection for the new settlement of Sunbury which was built on land owned by Carr. The fort was a square with each side measuring . Governor Henry Ellis noted that the fort had a battery of eight guns. By 1762 the fort had fallen into disrepair. =American Revolution= The need to defend the Medway River and Sunbury rose again at the outset of the American Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress authorized the construction of two forts in Georgia. One was to be built at Savannah and the other at Sunbury. A company of artillery consisting of fifty men was sent to the area. Fort Morris was built to the southeast of Sunbury and would be used first as a base for several campaigns to take British Florida and then as a defensive position in defending Sunbury and points upriver. The colonial forces were never able to establish control of Florida, which had become a refuge for loyalists. Royal Governor Patrick Tonyn of East Florida sought to invade Georgia. The East Florida Rangers were loyalists from Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Indian allies and the British 60th regiment was part of the plan to take Georgia from the Continental Army. The East Florida Rangers, a naval fleet, and loyalists from New York were quickly able to take Savannah in 1778. They next moved to Sunbury and Fort Morris. A small contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778. The 200 Americans at Fort Morris were led by Colonel John McIntosh. McIntosh defiantly replied, \\"Come and take it!\\" after the British demanded the surrender of the fort. The British declined to attack and pulled back only to return in January with a larger force. Fort Morris was attacked by the British on January 9, 1779, and was taken the next day. The number of lives lost in the siege is not well documented. Historians suppose that less than twelve American soldiers died and fewer British. The fort was renamed Fort George and was occupied by the British until September 1779, when the fort's garrison was ordered to Savannah to provide for its defense. After the fort was abandoned by the British it was taken again by colonial forces who found an empty fort with a few, damaged guns left behind. They were only able to hold the fort for a month before it was retaken by the British in October. Fort Morris/Fort George remained under the control of British forces until 1782. =War of 1812= The fort fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. The need to defend Sunbury and the river rose again with the outset of the War of 1812. Fort Defiance was constructed on the site of the former Fort Morris in 1814. Construction of the fort was not completed prior to the end of the war and it was left unfinished. =American Civil War= Fort Morris and Sunbury played a minor role in the American Civil War. A small group of Confederate soldiers were stationed at Sunbury and may have used the fort. General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea brought an influx of Union soldiers to the area. They removed some cannons from the fort in 1864 to be taken to Union- controlled forts on the Atlantic coast.

Ammonites and other invertebrates found at the Spheno Run site correlate well with the middle Severn Formation of Maryland. Spheno Run has so far produced a remarkable number of vertebrate specimens, especially from marine reptiles, including: carapace elements from at least two species of turtles, Peritresius ornatus and Taphrosphys sulcatus; various bone elements from at least two species of mosasaurs including a sizable fragment of dentary bone from Prognathodon rapax and numerous shed teeth from Mosasaurus maximus. Vertebrate remains also include material from sharks, particularly teeth and unusually large vertebral centra from an individual lamniform shark Squalicorax pristodontus, bony fish, and, rarely, dinosaurs. In addition to the vertebrate collection, Spheno Run also yields an abundance of invertebrate species including: twenty-two bivalves, seven gastropods, six cephalopods, and one each of echinoidea, porifera, and scaphopoda. It is rare to find such an extensive array of both vertebrate and invertebrate species within one horizon in New Jersey.Carter et al., 2008 = Other fossils = ;Bivalves * Cucullaea vulgaris ;Cephalopods * Baculites ovatus ;Fish * Leptomylus forfex * Edaphadon mirificus ;Reptiles * Agomphus pectoralis * Catapleura repanda * Dryptosaurus aquilunguis * Hadrosaurus minor * Hyposaurus rogersii * Mosasaurus dekayi * Mosasaurus hoffmanni * ?Hadrosauridae indet. * ?Lambeosaurinae indet. *Hadrosauromorpha indet.

Following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and his second abdication on 22 June 1815 the Executive Commission of 1815 was formed as a new government, declaring the Empire abolished for a second time on 26 June. Formation Napoleon left his exile on Elba and landed on the mainland near Cannes on 1 March 1815. He traveled north, with supporters flocking to his cause. On 16 March 1815 Louis XVIII addressed a meeting of both chambers, appealing to them to defend the constitutional charter. On the night of 19‚Äì20 March the king left his palace for Ghent in Belgium. Napoleon entered Paris on 20 March. He announced his ministers that day. Ministers The ministers were: * Foreign Affairs: Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt * Finance: Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin * Treasury: Nicolas Fran√ßois, Count Mollien * Interior: Lazare Carnot * Police: Joseph Fouch√© * Justice: Jean Jacques R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s * Navy and Colonies: Denis Decr√®s * War: Louis- Nicolas Davout * Secretary of State: Hugues-Bernard Maret, duc de Bassano Events On 22 April 1815 the emperor announced changes to the constitution that defined the roles of the two chambers and of the ministers. On 1 June 1815 a major ceremony was held on the Champ de Mars in which the Emperor's authority was formally recognized. On 12 June 1815 Napoleon left Paris for the north, where the allied forces of Britain and Prussia were assembling. He was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. Napoleon abdicated for the second time on 22 June 1815. That day the two chambers nominated the members of the French Provisional Government of 1815, which would serve as government until the second Bourbon Restoration.

Coble received their Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 2001. They then went on to receive their Master of Fine Arts from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. in 2004. Coble currently lives and has a studio in Gothenburg, Sweden and they are the Senior Lecturer in the Fri Konst and Photography Units of the MFA Programs at Valand Academy of Art, Gothenburg University. Coble is an advocate for the LGBT community, as their art revolves around the injustice the community faces. Coble's work has been featured in numerous solo performances/exhibitions and group exhibitions throughout the world. Coble has also taught extensively and held residencies at several schools and studios including the Oslo National Academy of the Arts, Bergen Academy of Art and Design, and Funen Art Academy. MC Coble discovered their interest in making images late in their college years, after their first photography course. Starting with making art of things that frustrated their, and later evolving into making political art. Installations and performances In 2005, Coble performed Note to Self at the Conner Contemporary Art gallery in Washington, DC. For the solo performance, Coble collected 436 names of gay, lesbian, bi, and transgender individuals that died due to hate crimes; as there was no official documentation before. They then had the names tattooed on their body, which took twelve hours, without ink creating an image of blood. Then each name was duplicated on a sheet of paper and the prints were hung on the wall. The use of inkless tattooing was to reference the brutality of the murders, many victims and slurs carved into their bodies. Deferral, performed and installed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC in 2013, dealt with FDA regulations banning men who have had sex with other men since 1977 from donating blood.\\"Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers\\", US Food and Drug Administration, 2013 August 19 (retrieved 2014 May 20) Coble collected slogans for blood donation campaigns and printed them on separation screens you may see at a donation site, there was also an outlines superhero repeated on many screens around the installation. Over the course of four days, Coble worked with a group of gay men who altered the superhero images with red string, as to replace their unacceptable blood. Coble had blood drawn on site and then used it to paint the word deferral in Morse code on the screens. When asked in an interview with The Huffington Post about why they chose to do a performance on this topic, Coble responded that it is \\"...an interest in queer issues of social injustice threads throughout my work. The White House is across from The Corcoran as is the Red Cross-- and so everything just came together.\\" As most of Coble's performances involve causing themself harm/pain; creating a beautiful yet frightening visual confrontation with the issues at hand. \\"It is not about hurting myself. It's the only way I can think to express these ideas that my audience will have a strong enough connection to.\\" Coble's installation Note to Self is owned by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

Life Born on 4 January 1773 at Quainton, Buckinghamshire, he was the son of James Lipscomb, surgeon R.N., by Mary, daughter of Jonathan George, yeoman, of Grendon Underwood in the same county. After attending schools at Quainton and Aylesbury, and receiving some medical instruction from his father, he studied surgery in London under Sir James Earle. In 1792 Lipscomb was appointed house- surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1794 he became lieutenant of the North Hants Militia, and in 1798 captain commandant of the Warwickshire volunteer infantry, for whom he wrote an Address to the Volunteers on their Duty to their King and Country. In 1798 also he was chosen deputy recorder of Warwick. On 6 June 1806 Lipscomb obtained from Marischal College, Aberdeen, the diploma of M.D. During 1811 he became co-editor of the National Adviser, a newspaper set up by Henry Redhead Yorke. He suggested the plan of the Society for the Encouragement of Agricultural Industry in an essay, for which he received a premium and a silver medal from the Board of Agriculture. Lipscomb died on 9 November 1846, and was buried in the graveyard of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. He was a friend of Henry Tattam, and cousin of William Lipscomb. Works Brook House, Princes Risborough, illustration from The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham (1847) by George Lipscomb Lipscomb's major work, The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham, was mainly based upon his own collections and those bequeathed to him by Edward Cooke (1772‚Äì1824). His prospectus produced a good list of subscribers. The first part appeared in 1831, after which the work had to be suspended, owing to Lipscomb's money troubles. Ultimately the publisher John Bowyer Nichols came to his aid, and before he died the last portion (pt. viii.) was in the press. The book fills four quarto volumes, with title-pages dated 1847. His other topographical works were: *A Journey into Cornwall through the Counties of Southampton, Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, and Devon, Warwick, 1799. *A Journey into South Wales, London, 1802. *A Description of Matlock-bath, with an Attempt to explain the Causes of the Heat, and of the Petrifying Quality of the Springs, to which is added some Account of Chatsworth and Kedleston, and the Mineral Waters of Quarndon and Kedleston, Birmingham, 1802. *A Journey round the Coast of Kent, London, 1818, supposed to have been compiled by L. Fussell. *The Sandgate, Hythe, and Folkstone Guide, Sandgate, 1823. His medical writings were: *An Essay on the Nature and Treatment of a putrid, malignant Fever which prevailed at Warwick in 1798, Warwick, 1799. *Observations on the History and Cause of Asthma, and a brief Review of a Practical Inquiry into disordered Respiration, London, 1800. *Inoculation for the Small-pox vindicated, London, 1805. *A Manual of Inoculation for the use of the Faculty and Private Families ‚Ä¶ extracted from the Writings of Dimsdale, Sutton, etc., London, 1806. *A Dissertation on the non-Infallibility of the Cow-pox, with an Examination of the principal Arguments of Drs. Jenner, Pearson, Woodville, Lettsom, Adams, and Thornton, London, 1806. *Cow-pox exploded, or the Inconsistencies, Absurdities, and Falsehoods of some of its Defenders exposed, London, 1806. *A Dissertation on the Failure and Mischiefs of the Cow-pox, London, 1806. *Cautions and Reflections on Canine Madness, with the Method of preventing the Hydrophobia in Persons who have been bitten, London, 1807. *A History of Canine Madness and Hydrophobia, London, 1809. *Observations on Contagion as it relates to the Plague and other epidemical Diseases, and refers to the Regulations of Quarantine, London, 1819. *A Grammar of Medicine, with Plan of the Grammar of Chemistry. *In 1832 Lipscomb delivered a series of lectures on cholera at the London Mechanics' Institution and the North London Literary and Scientific Institution. He published them as On the Nature, Symptoms, Treatment, and Cure of Cholera Morbus, with preliminary Remarks on Contagion and the Regulations of Quarantine, accompanied by his correspondence with Lord Melbourne on the subject. Other works included: *The Grey Friar, or the Black Spirit of the Wye, London, 1810. *Modern Times, or Anecdotes of the English Family. *The Capricious Mother. *Observations on the High Price of Provisions and the Monopoly of Farms. Articles by Lipscomb appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, mainly under the signature of \\"Viator\\"; and his essays on subjects connected with political economy, statistics, and general literature were published in the Literary Panorama and other periodicals. He edited the Clerical Guide for 1821, and published two volumes of Sermons, also writing them for clergymen. He composed hymns and anthems for charity schools on particular occasions. Family Lipscomb married, in 1803, Sarah, the widow of Richard Hopkins of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and third daughter of Thomas Wells, also of Stratford. They had no children. On his wife's death in 1834 her fortune, on which Lipscomb mainly depended, passed back to her own family.

She was one of the first female Episcopal priests in the United States, and a member of the Philadelphia Eleven: leaders of the movement to allow the ordination of women in the American Episcopal Church. Early life and education Betty Bone was born on April 2, 1923 in Cincinnati, Ohio to Leah and Evan Bone. She attended Hillsdale College Preparatory School where she was president of the student body in her senior year.p. 7 She then attended the University of Cincinnati and was the chaplain for Tri Delta.p. 8 Bone earned her BA in 1945. After graduating, she worked in the personnel department at Wright-Patterson Field.pp. 8‚Äì9 Bone earned her master's degree in 1947 from Syracuse University. She married William A. Schiess the same year and lived with him in Algiers for several weeks. She later wrote that they returned from their travels determined to \\"do something about the plight of the Negro.\\" They took part in demonstrations and marches in the Southern United States.pp. 158‚Äì159 During the late 1960s, Schiess worked with the Syracuse National Organization for Women chapter to reform the Episcopal church. She earned her Master of Divinity degree in 1972 from the Rochester Center for Theological Studies but was denied ordination due to her sex. In 1974 the Episcopal Church did not allow women to be ordained: efforts at two general conventions of bishops had failed. Schiess credited Betty Friedan's 1965 book The Feminine Mystique and the foundation of a chapter of the National Organization for Women in Syracuse with inspiring her to pursue priesthood and change in the Episcopal Church.Schiess, Betty Bone (2003). Why Me, Lord: The Story of One Woman‚Äôs Ordination (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press).  Ordination  Schiess and 10 other women, later known as the Philadelphia Eleven, were ordained in Pennsylvania by a group of retired bishops on July 29, 1974. Emily Hewitt, a friend of Schiess's from the Episcopal Peace Fellowship had asked her to join the group.p. 145 The ordainments were \\"irregular\\", meaning that they would need to be approved. They were later charged in ecclesiastical court. The Episcopal Diocese of Central New York refused to grant Schiess a license to perform priestly duties. In 1976, lawyer and New York State Assembly member Constance Cook acted as Schiess's advocate in filing a suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC/EEO), who issued a decision favoring Schiess.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Constance E. Cook, 89, Who Wrote Abortion Law, Is Dead \\", The New York Times, January 24, 2009. Accessed January 24, 2009. The General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America passed a resolution in July 1976 that \\"no one shall be denied access\\" to ordination in the church based on gender. In November 1976, Ned Cole, the bishop who had blocked Schiess' ordination, indicated that he would have her ordained in ceremonies to be held in January 1977.Associated Press. \\"An Episcopal Bishop Will Ordain The Woman Who Sparked Dispute\\", November 4, 1976. Accessed January 24, 2009. and in 1977, the church voted to permit the ordination of women. Schiess was chaplain at Syracuse from 1976 to 1978 and at Cornell from 1978 to 1979. One of the first weddings where Schiess officiated as priest was that of James Brule and Jill Woiler in 1975.  Later career  Schiess continued to advocate for change in the church. In 1983, she stated \\"the churches still aren't thinking twice about women's well being.\\" She later became rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Mexico, New York and was a member of the New York Task Force on Life and Law. In 1985, Joseph Agonito portrayed her story in the documentary film Woman Priest: A Portrait of the Rev. Betty Bone Schiess.p. 21 She was president of the International Association of Women Ministers. In 1994 she served on the Governor of New York's task force on bioethical issues. That same year she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In 2002 Schiess and tax resistor Margaret Rusk received the inaugural In the Spirit of Gage awards presented by the Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation.

DigitalOcean provides developers cloud services that help to deploy and scale applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers. As of January 2018, DigitalOcean was the third-largest hosting company in the world in terms of web-facing computers. History In 2003, Ben and Moisey Uretsky who had founded ServerStack, a managed hosting business, wanted to create a new product which would combine the web hosting and virtual servers. The Uretskys, having surveyed the cloud hosting market felt that most hosting companies were targeting enterprise clients leaving the entrepreneurial software developers market underserved. In 2011 the Uretskys founded DigitalOcean, a company which would provide server provisioning and cloud hosting for software developers. In 2012 the Uretskys met co-founder Mitch Wainer following Wainer's response to a Craigslist job listing. The company launched their beta product in January 2012. By mid-2012, the founding team consisted of Ben Uretsky, Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer, Jeff Carr, and Alec Hartman. After DigitalOcean was accepted into TechStars 2012's startup accelerator in Boulder, Colorado, the founders moved to Boulder to work on the product. By the end of the accelerator program in August 2012, the company had signed up 400 customers and launched around 10,000 cloud server instances. On January 16th, 2018, new droplet (virtual machines) plans were introduced on their blog. In May 2018, the company announced the launch of its Kubernetes-based container service. In June 2018, Mark Templeton, former CEO of Citrix, replaced co-founder Ben Uretsky as the company's CEO. In July 2019, Yancey Spruill, former CFO and COO of SendGrid (a fellow Techstars company), replaced Templeton as the CEO. =Growth= On January 15, 2013, DigitalOcean became one of the first cloud-hosting companies to offer SSD-based virtual machines. Following a TechCrunch review, which was syndicated by Hacker News, DigitalOcean saw a rapid increase in customers. In December 2013, DigitalOcean opened its first European data center located in Amsterdam. By the end of December 2013, Netcraft reported that DigitalOcean was the fastest growing cloud hosting service in the world in terms of web-facing computer count. During 2014, the company continued its expansion, opening new data centers in Singapore and London. By May 2015, DigitalOcean became the second largest hosting provider in the world according to a report by Netcraft. During 2015 DigitalOcean expanded further with a data center in Toronto, Canada. Later in 2016 they continued expansion to Bangalore, India. As of July 2017, the company has 12 data centers in various parts of the globe. =Funding= As of December 2015, DigitalOcean has raised US$123.21 million in funding. The company's seed funding was led by IA Ventures and raised US$3.2 million in July 2013. Its series A round of funding in March 2014, led by venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz, raised US$37.2 million. In December 2014, DigitalOcean raised US$50 million in debt financing from Fortress Investment Group in the form of a five-year term loan. In July 2015, the company raised US$83 million in its series B round of funding led by Access Industries with participation from Andreessen Horowitz. In April 2016, the company secured US$130 million in credit financing to build out new cloud services. In May 2020, Digital Ocean raised an additional $50 million from Access Industries and Andreessen Horowitz. =Blocking in Iran and Russia= DigitalOcean had been blocked in Iran, as a result of an attempt to cut off use of Lantern internet censorship circumvention tool. Because of Russian law, any host keeping citizen's personal data need to be located in national territory, that led to a temporary blocking in April 2018 of Google, Amazon, Azure and DigitalOcean among others in Russia by Roskomnadzor as a hosting provider for Telegram Messenger and VPS services.  Corporate affairs  = Leadership = DigitalOcean is managed by CEO Yancey Spruill. Other key executives are: * Carly Brantz, Chief Marketing Officer * Barry Cooks, Chief Technology Officer * Lysa Dahlin, Chief People Officer * Jeff Giannetti, Chief Customer Officer * Alan Shapiro, General Counsel * Bill Sorenson, Chief Financial Officer = Products / business model = DigitalOcean offers virtual private servers (VPS), or \\"droplets\\" using DigitalOcean terminology, using KVM as the hypervisor and can be created in various sizes (divided in 2 classes: standard, and optimized), in 12 different data center regions (as of April 2018) and with various options out of the box, including 6 GNU/Linux distributions and dozens of one-click applications. In early 2017, DigitalOcean expanded their feature set by adding load balancers to their offering. DigitalOcean can be managed through a web interface or using command line. DigitalOcean also offers block and object-based storage and since May 2018 Kubernetes-based container service. In 2014, Eric Lundquist's article on eWeek noted that DigitalOcean \\"has the easiest to understand pricing model.\\" Reviewers have noted that DigitalOcean requires users to have some experience in sysadmin and DevOps. In his review for ScienceBlogs, writer Greg Laden warned: \\"Digital Ocean is not for everybody. You need to be at least a little savvy with Linux ....\\" DigitalOcean community DigitalOcean currently offers a community resource, which provides developer-to-developer forums and tutorials on open source and sysadmin topics. As of August 2014, the Community resource receives 2 million visitors per month and has more than 1,000 vetted tutorials. In partnership with Stripe payment processing company, DigitalOcean sponsored Libscore tool to freely provide its developer community with open access to analytics on web development tools. DigitalOcean Marketplace provides a platform to distill operational knowledge into sharable and repeatable software through community collaboration.

He worked as a staff writer for The New Yorker from 1941 until his death in 1981.  Life and work  Daniel Lang was born on the Lower East Side of New York City to Fanny and Noosan Lang, Hungarian Jewish immigrants. He was raised by his mother and half-sister, Bella Cohen. These early years are described in a semi-autobiographical short story, \\"The Robbers,\\" by Daniel, and in \\"Streets, A Memoir of the Lower East Side,\\" written by Bella. By the time Lang reached high school age, he and his mother had moved to Brooklyn, where he attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1929. Following high school, he worked for several years, then entered the University of Wisconsin on scholarship, receiving his BA in 1936. After graduation, Lang worked as a government Works Progress Administration sociologist in the South. His life ambition was to write, however, and he soon found a job at The New York Post. During this time he met Margaret Altschul, a reporter for the New York Journal-American, whom he married in 1942. They were married for 39 years, living and raising their three daughters in New York City. Recalling Lang's appearance at the New Yorker, former New Yorker editor William Shawn wrote, \\"He arrived in our offices one day in 1941, shortly before the United States entered the Second World War, with an impressive sheaf of clippings of articles he had written for the New York Post. He was immediately taken onto the staff and soon wrote his first Reporter-at-Large piece on the British American Ambulance Corps. Lang served as war correspondent for the New Yorker in Italy, France and North Africa. Following the war, he observed and reported on atomic testing. Problems raised by nuclear testing concerning the moral responsibility of scientists remained a keen interest and the topic of many articles over the years. During the Vietnam War era, he became absorbed by the ethical choices raised by this conflict and was one of the first reporters to expose military atrocities against the Vietnamese civilian population. Toward the end of his writing career, he interviewed aging Germans, former Flakhelfer, about their role in the Third Reich, returning to his focus on how individuals can become implicated in evil through denial and the refusal to acknowledge reality. Many of his New Yorker articles were collected and published in book form and translated into various languages including Spanish, Dutch, German, Polish and Japanese. William Shawn described Lang's work in this way: \\"He was one of the most steadfast and talented of our reportorial writers. His writings invariably had moral weight. He was a student of the conscience. Implicit in every piece he wrote was a controlling idea, but he never lapsed into abstraction. He tried very hard to understand the people he wrote about, and far more often than not he succeeded.‚Äù And in the words of author John Hersey, ‚ÄúIn all his years of writing, Dan never touched...a trivial subject. In his person he was extraordinarily modest, as writers go, but the reach of his mind as an author could not have been more ambitious. As he grew from piece to piece, he stubbornly and courageously manifested that his job as a writer in the atomic age was nothing less than to address the moral consciousness of humankind.... But the tone of his work was never inflated or too grand, as such subjects and themes might have threatened to make it. The power of his voice came paradoxically from its quietness. He approached our minds and hearts very simply, in a storyteller's way, through tales about people faced with the great dilemmas of our time.‚Äù In addition to journalism, Lang wrote poetry, children‚Äôs literature, short stories and an opera libretto. His New Yorker article, \\"The Bank Drama,\\" reported on a hostage situation in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973, from which psychiatrist Nils Bejerot coined the phrase \\"Stockholm syndrome.\\" Personal life He was married to Margaret Altschul, New York Times: \\"Daniel Lang, 66, Correspondent and author for New Yorker, dies\\" November 19, 1981 daughter of banker Frank Altschul and sister of Arthur Altschul.

Claytor was the Democratic candidate for Indiana State Auditor during the 2014 election cycle, losing the race to Republican Suzanne Crouch. Prior to entering the race for Auditor, Claytor, a licensed CPA, worked for 15 years at the Indiana State Board of Accounts, where he served as Deputy Chief Examiner before transitioning to a career in the private sector and becoming a partner at Crowe Horwath LLP. He retired from the private sector in 2012. Claytor worked as treasurer for the gubernatorial campaign of former state representative John Gregg.  Childhood and Education  Claytor (b. 1952) grew up in Hartford City, Indiana, about 75 miles northeast of Indianapolis. After graduating from Blackford High School in 1970, Claytor attended Ball State University, earning an undergraduate degree in accounting. In 1979, he became a licensed CPA and graduated cum laude with a JD from Indiana University - Indianapolis Law School in 1983.  Accounting  = Indiana State Board of Accounts = In 1974, Claytor started his career with the Indiana State Board of Accounts, serving during the administrations of Governors Otis Bowen and Robert Orr.

In 1992, after three years working with the firm, he became a partner. He retired in 2012.  Political career  Claytor announced his candidacy for Indiana State Auditor on September 12, 2013, initially challenging incumbent Dwayne Sawyer. Sawyer resigned on November 26, 2013, following Claytor's entrance into the race, and Republican State Representative Suzanne Crouch was appointed to the position. On May 31, 2014, Claytor became the official nominee for the Democratic Party. Claytor would have been the first Democrat to hold the office since Otis E. Cox in 1982. = 2014 Election = Claytor ran his campaign on the premise of being the first Certified Public Accountant to run for Auditor of State. His platform centered around establishing accountability for taxpayer investments, ensuring proper accounting of state funds, developing a more extensive government transparency portal, restoring independence to the State Board of Accounts, and restoring the independent audit authority of the Auditor's office. Throughout his campaign, Claytor criticized the state's loss of $500 million in tax revenues due to accounting errors, which were discovered in 2011. He pledged to create an internal audit function in order to prevent similar errors in the future. In the November 4 elections, Claytor received 36% of the votes, placing second behind Republican Suzanne Crouch.

Biography Sophia Eckerson was born around 1880 (her exact date of birth is unknown) in Old Tappan, New Jersey to Albert Bogert Eckerson and Ann Hennion Eckerson. After graduating from secondary school, Eckerson did not immediately go to university and instead helped her brothers in college. By 1901, however, she had enrolled in Smith College in Massachusetts where she was inspired by William Francis Ganong to study and pursue a career in botany and plant physiology. Eckerson completed her bachelor's degree in 1905 and stayed at Smith College for her master's degree which she completed in 1907. During her time at Smith College Eckerson taught botany and plant microchemistry, working as a demonstrator and assistant in the botany department between 1905 and 1909. Travelling to the University of Chicago in 1909, Eckerson was awarded her PhD in 1911. Following her doctorate, Eckerson obtained the post of assistant plant physiologist at the University of Chicago until 1915 when she became an instructor of plant microchemistry. Between 1921 and 1922 Eckerson taught and did research at the University of Wisconsin whilst also working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Plant Industry, before taking a job as plant microchemist at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York in 1924; a position in which she remained for the rest of her career, eventually becoming chair of the institute's Department of Microchemistry. Due to often moving around the country with her work, Eckerson never married. She retired from active work in 1940, and died on July 19, 1954 in Pleasant Valley, Connecticut following a week's illness. Research Eckerson's work on plant chemistry began with her PhD on the topic of how seed embryos change during germination. At the Boyce Thompson Institute, she conducted experiments on how plants synthesize proteins found in the soil, and later on the processes by which cotton and other plants produce cellulose particles. Eckerson served as vice chair (1934) and chair (1935) of the physiological section of the Botanical Society of America; a rare position for a woman at that time.

Hardware interface design (HID) is a cross-disciplinary design field that shapes the physical connection between people and technology in order to create new hardware interfaces that transform purely digital processes into analog methods of interaction. It employs a combination of filmmaking tools, software prototyping, and electronics breadboarding. Through this parallel visualization and development, hardware interface designers are able to shape a cohesive vision alongside business and engineering that more deeply embeds design throughout every stage of the product. The development of hardware interfaces as a field continues to mature as more things connect to the internet. Hardware interface designers draw upon industrial design, interaction design and electrical engineering. Interface elements include touchscreens, knobs, buttons, sliders and switches as well as input sensors such as microphones, cameras, and accelerometers. The Teenage Engineering OP-1 combines a mixture of hardware buttons, knobs, and a color-coded OLED display. An iPod, an iconic & revolutionary hardware interface that re-imagined the jog wheel.  History  In the last decade a trend had evolved in the area of human-machine-communication, taking the user experience from haptic, tactile and acoustic interfaces to a more digitally graphical approach. Important tasks that had been assigned to the industrial designers so far, had instead been moved into fields like UI and UX design and usability engineering. The creation of good user interaction was more a question of software than hardware. Things like having to push two buttons on the tape recorder to have them pop back out again and the cradle of some older telephones remain mechanical haptic relicts that have long found their digital nemesis and are waiting to disappear. However, this excessive use of GUIs in today‚Äôs world has led to a worsening impairment of the human cognitive capabilities. Visual interfaces are at the maximum of their upgradability. Even though the resolution of new screens is constantly rising, you can see a change of direction away from the descriptive intuitive design to natural interface strategies, based on learnable habits (Google‚Äôs Material Design, Apple‚Äôs iOS flat design, Microsoft‚Äôs Metro Design Language). Several of the more important commands are not shown directly but can be accessed through dragging, holding and swiping across the screen; gestures which have to be learned once but feel very natural afterwards and are easy to remember. In the area of controlling these systems, there is a need to move away from GUIs and instead find other means of interaction which use the full capabilities of all our senses. Hardware interface design solves this by taking physical forms and objects and connecting them with digital information to have the user control virtual data flow through grasping, moving and manipulating the used physical forms. If you see the classic industrial hardware interface design as an ‚Äúanalog‚Äù method, it finds its digital counterpart in the HID approach. Instead of translating analog methods of control into a virtual form via a GUI, one can see the TUI as an approach to do the exact opposite: transmitting purely digital processes into analog methods of interaction.  Examples  Example hardware interfaces include a computer mouse, TV remote control, kitchen timer, control panel for a nuclear power plant and an aircraft cockpit.

Set during the early years of World War II the story describes the strange relationship that develops between a young army deserter and a married woman struggling to run a farm alone in the absence of her P.O.W. husband. Bates later said he began working on the story in 1943 but encountered a stumbling block over a character, later removed, and was unable to make any progress with the project until 1968.http://hebatescompanion.com/node/612 Although first published in book form in 1970, the complete story was originally published in the Daily Telegraph magazine in instalments during December 1969.http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548130.The_Triple_Echo The book was filmed in 1972. Plot Introduction In the early years of World War II Alice Charlesworth is running a farm single-handed in the absence of her husband who is incarcerated in a Japanese P.O.W. camp. When she encounters Barton, a young deserter, on her land she gladly accepts him into her home and her bed. Although Barton eases Alice‚Äôs loneliness and her frustrations, they do not become friends and there is always some uneasiness between them, perhaps owing to the difference in their ages or perhaps to Barton's weak and frivolous nature. To hide the young man from detection Alice dresses him in her own clothes and tells people that he is her sister. The drama reaches a shocking conclusion when army MPs arrive searching for the deserter and one of them is attracted to Barton, believing him to be a woman.

The band formed in response to more and more males being drafted into the armed forces. The Prairie View Co-eds' success soon spread past the limits of their college campus though, and they were soon touring and traveling much of the year. Beginnings In the early 1940s, Prairie View College was one of the leading African American colleges in the country, and one of the only four-year public schools African Americans could attend in Texas. The band that dominated the campus was the Prairie View Collegians, an all-male group that played gigs on campus as well as some touring. When she arrived at the school, the exceedingly skilled Bert Etta Davis auditioned for the Prairie View Collegians and was accepted by the band leader. An extremely talented alto saxophonist, Davis ended up being turned away from the band by the Dean of Women who found the concept of a woman playing in an all men's band too scandalous to allow. By 1943 though, the times had changed. The Prairie View Collegians had lost many members to the draft, and lacked the numbers to continue making strong performances. Will Henry Bennett began to make a move to start an all-female dance band, possibly in response to having seen The International Sweethearts of Rhythm. The band was a hodge-podge of talent its first year. The group did draw some talented players like Davis, but also recruited from people to whom playing was just an extracurricular activity. They also relied on music majors to fill spots and pick up new instruments that no one had been trained on. This group was not merely a collection of beginners though. While the original venues of the Co-eds was campus parties and events, it wasn't very long before they began to be invited off campus. With most men's orchestras having fallen to pieces, The Prairie View Co-eds filled a need. A chaperone followed the band to their destinations in order to make sure the reputation of these educated young women would not be sullied. Growth After its first year of popularity, the Prairie View Co-eds began to make a name for themselves. Through word of mouth, the tale of a skilled collegiate all-female band spread, and soon talented musicians were actively coming to Prairie View College in order to join the Co-eds. This marked a distinct shift from extracurricular activity performed casually to a greater focus on musicianship as a career for these women. The Co-eds went on more serious tours, often taking a teacher and a chaperone with them. Soon summer and winter tours were also established, and the Prairie View Co-eds were functioning like professionals. This group was championed by the Black press as symbols of successful, educated African American women who seemed to be representative of a patriotic spirit. The Prairie View Co-eds were even able to perform at USO shows. Their performance marked a success for black military personnel who were often excluded from the entertainment white soldiers received. The Co-eds played to black and white soldier audiences, meaning that African American soldiers were not just getting the entertainment they were so often denied, but they were also getting the performance from an African American group. The Prairie View Co-eds also engaged in rather extreme tours during the summer months. They were constant professionals and worked with the Moe Gale Agency, Gale being the owner of the Savoy Ballroom. Touring was difficult during this time period as many problems were encountered with the rationing that occurred because of the war. Gas and rubber for tires were rationed, and oftentimes the only reason the Co-eds had access to ration coupons for these items was because of their work with the USO. Touring seemed to be worth it though, as the Prairie View Co-eds were able to perform at venues such as the Apollo Theater. The fact that they were listed as Co-eds was important too, as it confirmed them as symbols of educated African Americans, as well as being youthful and attractive. Sources  Tucker, Sherrie.

It is located in the wall on the city's northwest side and connects to a highway leading out to Nablus, which in the Hebrew Bible was called Shechem or Sichem, and from there, in times past, to the capital of Syria, Damascus; as such, its modern English name is Damascus Gate, and its modern Hebrew name, Sha'ar Shkhem (), meaning Shechem Gate, or Nablus Gate. Of its historic Arabic names, Bab al-Nasr () means \\"gate of victory,\\" and Bab al-Amud () means \\"gate of the column.\\" The latter name, in use continuously since at least as early as the 10th century, preserves the memory of a Roman column towering over the square behind the gate and dating to the 2nd century AD.  History  In its current form, the gate was built in 1537 under the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent. Beneath the current gate, the remains of an earlier gate can be seen, dating back to the time of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who visited the region in 130‚Äì131 CE.Archaeological Sites in Israel-Jerusalem: The Northern Gate of Aelia Capitolina, on the website of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 29 July 1998, retrieved 2 March 2018 In the square behind this gate stood a Roman victory column topped by a statue of Emperor Hadrian, as depicted on the 6th-century Madaba Map. This historical detail is preserved in the current gate's Arabic name, Bab el-Amud, meaning \\"gate of the column\\". On the lintel of the 2nd-century gate, which has been made visible by archaeologists beneath today's Ottoman gate, is inscribed the city's Roman name after 130 CE, Aelia Capitolina. Until the latest excavations (1979-1984), some researchers believed that Hadrian's gate was preceded by one erected by Agrippa I (r. 41‚Äì44 CE) as part of the so-called Third Wall.Israel Antiquities Authority, The Damascus Gate Section, accessed January 2016. Quote: \\"Some researchers believe the gate was first erected at the time of Agrippa I, in the mid first century CE. If so, then the ancient gate structure was incorporated in course of the Third Wall.\\" However, recent research seems to prove that the gate does not predate the Roman reconstruction of the city as Aelia Capitolina, during the first half of the second century. Hadrian's Roman gate was built as a free-standing triumphal gate, and only sometime towards the end of the 3rd or the very beginning of the 4th century were there protective walls built around Jerusalem, connecting to the existing gate. The Roman gate remained in use during the Early Muslim and Crusader period, but several storerooms were added by the Crusaders outside the gate, so that access to the city became possible only by passing through those rooms. Several phases of construction work on the gate took place during the early 12th century (first Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1099‚Äì1187), the early Ayyubid period (1187-1192), and the 13th-century second phase of Crusader rule over Jerusalem. Damascus Gate is the only Jerusalem gate to have preserved its name, Bab al-Amud, since at least the 10th century. The Crusaders called it St. Stephen's Gate (in Latin, Porta Sancti Stephani), highlighting its proximity to the site of martyrdom of Saint Stephen, marked since the time of Empress Eudocia by a church and monastery.:fr:Basilique Saint-√âtienne de J√©rusalem A 1523 account of a visit to Jerusalem by a Jewish traveller from Leghorn uses the name B√¢b el 'Amud and notes its proximity to the Cave of Zedekiah. Nablus (Damascus) Gate 1920 Damascus Gate VIDEO  Description  Damascus Gate is flanked by two towers, each equipped with machicolations. It is located at the edge of the Arab bazaar and marketplace in the Muslim Quarter. In contrast to the Jaffa Gate, where stairs rise towards the gate, in the Damascus Gate, the stairs descend towards the gate. Until 1967, a crenellated turret loomed over the gate, but it was damaged in the fighting that took place in and around the Old City during the Six-Day War. In August 2011, Israel restored the turret, including its arrowslit, with the help of pictures from the early twentieth century when the British Empire controlled Jerusalem. Eleven anchors fasten the restored turret to the wall, and four stone slabs combine to form the crenellated top. Directly below the visible gate there is an older gate, believed to have been built in the early first or second centuries CE.Hillel Geva and Dan Bahat, Architectural and Chronological Aspects of the Ancient Damascus Gate Area, Israel Exploration Journal, Vol. 48, No. 3/4, Jerusalem 1998, pp. 225-226 Such findings are in keeping with an account in the Midrash Rabba (Eikha Rabba 1:32) which states that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, during the Roman siege of Jerusalem, requested of Vespasian that he spare the western-most gates of the city () that lead to Lydda (Lod). When the city was eventually taken, the Arab auxiliaries who had fought alongside the Romans under their general, Fanjar, also spared the wall from destruction. The chronicler who brings down the historical record adds: \\"And it was decreed in heaven that it should never be destroyed, seeing that the Divine Presence dwells in the West.\\" Old Roman era gate  Archaeology  In 2013, an archaeological survey-excavation was conducted at the Damascus Gate by Zubair Adawi on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2013, Survey Permit # A-6799.

The gate is situated near the southeast corner of the Old City, southwest of the Temple Mount. Directly behind the gate lies the entrance to the Western Wall Plaza. The Dung Gate is a main passage for vehicles coming out of the Old City and for buses headed to the Western Wall. Name The name Sha'ar Ha'ashpot appears in the Book of Nehemiah (. It is probably named after the residue that was taken from the Jewish Temple into the Valley of Hinnom, where it was burned. This ancient \\"Dung Gate\\" may not have been in the same location as the 16th-century gate, which only received this name in the 19th century. Although Dung Gate is also known as the Mughrabi Gate, that name normally refers to one of the gates of the Temple Mount, which is inside the Old City walls. The name alludes to the Mughrabi Quarter, a neighborhood of North African Kutama Fatimids which was situated between both gates until 1967. The name Silwan Gate refers to the village of Silwan that lies outside the gate, broadly southeast of it. History Ottoman Dung Gate during the Mandate period =Fortified Ottoman postern= The Dung Gate was built as part of the new city walls erected under Suleiman the Magnificent between 1537-1541. The original gate was just 1.5 metres wide, topped by an arch and only designed for pedestrians and pack animals to pass through. Initially the gate, or more precisely the postern, included an inner gate tower, which was demolished still during the Ottoman period. Towards the end of Ottoman rule, a new gate tower or gatehouse was added, but this time outside the wall, in a style that blended in with the 16th-century fortifications. This outer tower was demolished by the British Mandate officials in 1938, probably as part of their drive to restore the walls to their original look, this bringing back to light the old stone decorations. =Jordanian and Israeli modernisation= In 1952, when the gate was widened by the Jordanian authorities to allow cars and buses to pass through here, a reinforced concrete girder was installed under the old stone arch. In 1984-85 the gate was again enlarged, the old arch and the other decorative elements being raised, so that the opening reached a height of 4.5 metres. The modern gate is built of reinforced concrete, but clad in stone, and the new design helps the old and new elements blend together without disturbing the general style of the city wall, with the gate's opening closing in a more curvy line in stead of the straight Jordanian lintel. Landscape architect Shlomo Aronson cooperated with architect Arthur Kutcher at implementing the decision of the Jerusalem Foundation established by then- mayor Teddy Kollek, motivated by the sharp increase in pilgrims traffic.

The Patriarchate compound (light grey) includes the Cathedral of St. James (dark grey). The Armenian Quarter (, Harat al-Arman; , Ha-Rova ha- Armeni; , ) () (, ) is one of the four quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem. Located in the southwestern corner of the Old City, it can be accessed through the Zion Gate and Jaffa Gate. It occupies an area of 0.126 km¬≤ (126 dunam), which is 14% of the Old City's total. In 2007, it had a population of 2,424 (6.55% of Old City's total). In both criteria, it is comparable to the Jewish Quarter. The Armenian Quarter is separated from the Christian Quarter by David Street (Suq el-Bazaar) and from the Jewish Quarter by Habad Street (Suq el- Husur). The Armenian presence in Jerusalem dates back to the 4th century AD, when Armenia adopted Christianity as a national religion and Armenian monks settled in Jerusalem. Hence, it is considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Gradually, the quarter developed around the St. James Monastery‚Äîwhich dominates the quarter‚Äîand took its modern shape by the 19th century. The monastery houses the Armenian Apostolic Church's Jerusalem Patriarchate, which was established as a diocese in the 7th century AD. The patriarchate is the de facto administrator of the quarter and acts as a \\"mini-welfare state\\" for the Armenian residents. The Armenian community has been in decline since the mid-20th century, and is in immediate danger of disappearing, according to Bert Vaux. Though formally separate from Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter to be part of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. Location, borders and surface The Armenian Quarter is located in the southwestern corner of Jerusalem's Old City. The quarter can be accessed through the Zion Gate and Jaffa Gate. According to a 2007 study published by the International Peace and Cooperation Center, the quarter occupies an area of 0.126 km¬≤ (126 dunam), which is 14% of the Old City's total. The Armenian Quarter is formally separated from the Christian Quarter by David Street (Suq el-Bazaar) and by Habad Street (Suq el-Husur) from the Jewish Quarter. History =Origins= In the early 4th century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, became the first country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are recorded to have settled in Jerusalem as early as the 4th century, after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the 5th century. Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem‚Äì\\"most intense of all cities\\"‚Äîproves their extraordinary resilience. Armenian churches were constructed during that period, including the St. James Monastery.Sanjian, Avedis (1965). The Armenian Communities in Syria under Ottoman Dominion. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, pp. 1‚Äì6. The latter was last expanded in the mid-12th century. An Armenian scriptorium was in operation by the mid-5th century. A secular community composed of merchants and artisans was established in the 6th century in the Zion Quarter, where an Armenian street existed (Ruda Armeniorum). =Byzantine and Early Muslim periods= In the First Council of Dvin (506), the Armenian Church broke off from Chalcedonian Christianity by rejecting the dual nature of Christ, which was agreed upon in the Council of Chalcedon of 451. Thus, the Armenians found themselves in direct confrontation with the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian I persecuted whom he considered to be Monophysite Armenians, forcing them to leave Jerusalem. A 7th-century Armenian chronicler mentioned the existence of seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, some of which have been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638 AD, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. =Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods= In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The entrance to St. James monastery In 1311, during Mamluk rule, Archbishop Sarkis (1281‚Äì1313) assumed the title of patriarch according to a decree by Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad. In the 1340s, the Armenians were permitted to build a wall around their quarter. This signified that the Mamluk rulers felt that the quarter did not pose a threat. Destroying city walls and fortifications had been a staple of Mamluk governance in order to prevent the Crusaders from returning and reestablishing their rule. The Mamluk government also engraved the following declaration in Arabic on the western entrance to the quarter: Jerusalemite historian Mujir al-Din provided a detailed description of pre-Ottoman Jerusalem in 1495 in which he mentioned Dir el-Arman (Monastery of the Armenians) or Kanisat Mar Ya'qub (St. James Cathedral). =Ottoman period= An Armenian priest in Jerusalem c. 1900 pictured smoking a hookah with the Dormition Abbey in the background The Ottoman tolerated the presence of non-Muslim, Dhimmi, communities including the Christian Armenians. There was religious tolerance and an Ottoman administration existed to sort out religious differences between the rival Christian churches and Muslims. Israeli historians Kark and Oren-Nordheim wrote in 2001: \\"The Armenian Quarter, although Christian, represented a distinct ethnic group with its particular language and culture, intent on retaining separate identity and unity, minimizing the contacts with Arabs and the Ottoman authorities for fear of persecution.\\"Kark, Ruth and Michal Oren Nordheim (2001). Jerusalem and Its Environs: Quarter, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800‚Äì1948. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 45. Many members of the Armenian community in Jerusalem spoke Arabic, in addition to Armenian. In 1538, the current walls of Jerusalem were completed on the orders of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along with the internal walls built by the Armenians, determined the outline of the quarter. In the 1562‚Äì63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%.Peri, Oded (2001). Christianity under Islam in Jerusalem: The Question of the Holy Sites in Early Ottoman Times (Ottoman Empire & Its Heritage). Leiden: Brill, p. 20. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615‚Äì16. The significant increase in the population in 1690 is attributed to urbanization experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community. In the 19th century, most of the Armenian and Christian quarters had \\"European-style gable roofs\\" as opposed to the domes preferred in the Muslim and Jewish quarters. In 1833 the Armenians established the city's first printing press. A seminary was opened in 1857. In 1855 the first photographic workshop in Jerusalem was founded in the Armenian Quarter. Schools for boys (1840) and girls (1862) were united in 1869 under the name Holy Translators' School and became the first coeducational school in Jerusalem. An 1883 map of the Old City, showing the four quarters In 1854 Karl Marx reported 350 Armenians in Jerusalem. In 1883, 102 Armenian families (8%) constituted the third largest Christian community in the Old City after the Greek Orthodox and Catholic (Latin) communities. Besides these residents, in the same year, 46 Armenian priests and monks and 55 servicemen lived within the St. James Monastery. According to the 1905 Ottoman census in the Old City, the Armenian Quarter had a population of 382, of which Armenians (121) comprised less than one-third (31.7%). Jews (127) made up 33.2%, other Christians (94) 24.6% and Muslims (40) 10.5%. The Jews, who numbered a little more than the Armenians, inhabited the eastern part of the Armenian Quarter, which in the second half of the nineteenth century, became the western part of the Jewish Quarter. =World War I, British, and Jordanian periods= Prior to World War I, there were some 2,000‚Äì3,000 Armenians in Palestine, mostly in Jerusalem, which was captured by the British in 1917. From 1915 and onward, thousands of Armenian Genocide survivors from Cilicia (Adana Vilayet) found refuge, and settled in the quarter, increasing its population. In 1925, around 15,000 Armenians are believed to have lived in all of Palestine, with the majority in Jerusalem. During the British Mandate period, the number of Armenians is estimated to have reached up to 20,000. However, the 1931 British census showed only 3,524 Armenians in all of Palestine. In 1947, around 1,500 Armenians from Palestine repatriated to Soviet Armenia as part of the Soviet government's efforts to boost Armenia's population by a large-scale repatriation of ethnic Armenians, mostly from the Middle East. This marked the beginning of the long-term decline of the Armenian community of Jerusalem. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Armenian Quarter was damaged by bombs. It housed many Armenians from around Palestine. An Armenian civil guard, armed with what Der Matossian describes as \\"makeshift weapons\\", was formed to defend the quarter. Over 40 Armenians died during the war. =Israeli period= Jerusalem's Old City came under Israeli control in the aftermath of the Six- Day War in 1967. However, the Armenian patriarchate is the de facto administrator of the quarter and acts as a \\"mini-welfare state\\" for the Armenian residents. The Arab-Israeli conflict significantly affected the quarter's politically uninvolved Armenian population. A 1992 article published by the Catholic Near East Welfare Association stated that \\"Armenians in Jerusalem try to maintain good relations with Arabs and Israelis, but they do not deny that their community has been affected by tensions in the city.\\" Issues A major obstacle for the Armenians residing in the Armenian Quarter is their Jordanian citizenship (from before 1967), because of which the Israeli government considers them \\"permanent residents\\"‚Äîthe same status as Palestinians. The Jerusalem Post wrote in 2005 that the Israeli bureaucracy \\"considers Jerusalem Armenians to be Palestinians, which means endless delays in getting documents, and hassles at the airport.\\" A map published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in November 2015 indicated the Armenian Quarter in the color reserved for Palestinian communities. According to Armenian researcher Tamar Boyadjian, because Armenians are considered Palestinians for all legal purposes they have difficulty obtaining travel and marriage documents. Graham Usher, a Palestine- based foreign correspondent of several Western newspapers, wrote in 2000 in a publication of the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies that the Armenians \\"were burdened with the status of being Palestinian 'residents' but ethnically Armenian. And indeed their lives, properties and heritage have been bound by the same Israeli constraints as their Palestinian compatriots.\\" The Economist also wrote in 2000 that Armenians have faced restrictions on their lives similar to those imposed on the Palestinians, such as prevention of construction of new buildings in the Armenian Quarter. The limited space in the overpopulated district makes housing expensive and according to Boyadjian, \\"Most Armenians, given their current income, simply cannot afford to maintain their primary residence there.\\" The Armenian Patriarchate has voiced concerns about the Israeli police not treating spitting by Haredi Jews on Armenian clergy, students and teachers as hate crime. Furthermore, clergy who have lived at the Armenian monastery compound for decades do not have residency status, and, thus, \\"pay as tourists for public services such as healthcare.\\" As of mid-2019 a memorial to the Armenian genocide on church property \\"remains closed to visitors because the municipality has delayed approving construction of the entrance.\\" Post-1967 Jewish settlement Map of the southern part of the Old City showing the four quarters and the area within the Armenian Quarter expropriated (in dark blue) for the reconstruction of an extended Jewish Quarter in 1968 (according to the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs). ( During the Jordanian rule of the eastern Jerusalem (1948‚Äì67), no Jews were allowed to live in the Old City. Since the start of Israeli rule of the Old City in 1967, the Jewish Quarter has expanded by some 40% and by 2000, 71 (12%) or 81 (14%) of the 581 properties in the Armenian Quarter were owned by Jews. The Armenian community is concerned that the Jewish Quarter \\"will expand as the number of Jews in the Old City continues to grow while the Armenian population withers.\\" The location of the Armenian Quarter athwart the main access roads between the Israeli-controlled West Jerusalem and the holy sites within the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall has made Armenian properties a prime real estate in Israeli eyes. According to Reuters, the Armenian Patriarchate \\"share[s] a view held by the mostly Muslim Palestinians‚Äîthat Israel's designation of the whole city as capital of the Jewish state means its control of residence and building permits is being used to press Arabs and other non-Jews to give up and leave.\\" Israeli sovereignty over the Armenian Quarter would be, according to Usher, the \\"worst future imaginable\\" for the Armenian community. Members of Jerusalem's Armenian community have voiced concerns about the Israeli government's policies and commitment to preserving their community's presence in the Old City. Demographics Writing in 2000, Graham Usher estimated that the Armenian Quarter had a population of 1,200. According to a 2007 study, the quarter housed 2,424 people (6.55% of Old City's total). = Decline of Armenian population= scouts during Easter parade Armenians began emigrating from Jerusalem's Old City in the mid-20th century, being in the middle of the conflict between Arabs and Jews, mainly since the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and what Daphne Tsimhoni characterized as \\"their feeling of loneliness.\\" The lack of a longstanding political solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict for Jerusalem has been cited as the main cause of the decrease in the number of Armenians in the Old City, which fell by almost half from 1,598 in 1967 to 790 in 2006. Meanwhile, the Muslim population increased from 16,681 to 27,500 and the Jewish population from 0 (after their expulsion under Jordanian rule) to 3,089. The exodus of the Armenians intestified following the breakout of the First Intifada in 1987. According to Tsolag Momjian, the honorary Armenian consul in Jerusalem, as of 2009 around 600 Armenians lived in the Armenian Quarter (out of the total 2,000 Armenians in all of Jerusalem). (archived, ) Two articles, published in 2010 and 2011, put the number of Armenians in the Armenian Quarter as low as 500. A street in the quarter Despite the drastic decline in the number of Armenians, Israeli scholar Daphne Tsimhoni wrote in 1983 that \\"the existence of their church headquarters in Jerusalem provides for the continued presence of some clergy and a certain number of laity.\\" On the contrary, American linguist Bert Vaux argued in 2002 that the Armenian community of Jerusalem is \\"in immediate danger of disappearing‚Äîthe wealthy move into other parts of Jerusalem, and the closed environment in the Armenian Quarter spurs many to move to Beirut or the West.\\" Armenian author Matthew Karanian wrote about the Armenian community of Jerusalem in 2010 as follows: Subgroups Haytayan identifies three groups of Armenians living within the Armenian Quarter The first group includes monks and clergymen (around 50), who live within the monastery. Lay people are divided into two groups: those living within the monastery compound, and those living in the Armenian Quarter, but outside of the monastery walls. Around two-thirds of lay persons reside within the monastery walls. Locally known as vanketsi (’æ’°’∂÷Ñ’•÷Å’´, lit. \\"those from the convent\\"), they number up to 700 people. () They do not pay rent (or pay only a symbolic amount) to the patriarchate. Those living outside of the monastery walls are called kaghakatsi (÷Ñ’°’≤’°÷Ñ’°÷Å’´, lit. \\"city-dwellers\\"). Their ancestry goes back centuries. They pay only municipal taxes. Bert Vaux identifies two subgroups of Armenians: *k‚Äòa≈Çak‚Äòac‚Äòis (\\"citizens\\" or \\"city dwellers\\") are the indigenous Armenian-speaking inhabitants of the quarter. They live outside the monastery walls, and attend the Church of the Holy Archangels (Hreshtakapetats). *k‚Äòa≈Çt‚Äòagans (\\"[im]migrants\\") are ancestors of Armenians from various parts of the Ottoman Empire who moved to Jerusalem following the 1915 genocide. They attend services at the cathedral of St. James. According to Vaux, \\"In the period immediately after their arrival they were referred to by the k‚Äòa≈Çak‚Äòac‚Äòis as zuwar, the Arabic word for ‚Äòvisitors‚Äô. The k‚Äòa≈Çt‚Äòagans in turn are reported to have labelled the k‚Äòa≈Çak‚Äòac‚Äòis as p‚Äòis arab ‚Äòdirty Arab‚Äô. The two groups each remained wary of the other for some time, and in fact did not intermarry on a significant scale until after World War II.

This stance was reaffirmed by Armenia's Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, who in late 2000 stated that Armenia was against the separation of the Armenian and Christian Quarters. In 2017 Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan stated that \\"Jerusalem has a centuries old Armenian presence, a rich Armenian historical and cultural heritage.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak conditionally embraced the proposal. =Palestinian views= Palestinian leaders have publicly declared that they consider the Armenian Quarter to be a part of Palestine and will not relinquish it to Israel. Yasser Arafat, rejected the US proposal at the 2000 Camp David Summit for the Old City's division and stated: \\"The Armenian quarter belongs to us. We and Armenians are one people.\\" He told Clinton, \\"My name is not Yasir Arafat, it is Yasir Arafatian,\\" making his name sound Armenian. \\"I will not betray my Armenian brothers,\\" Arafat said about leaving the Armenian Quarter under Israeli rule. Commenting on his statements, historians Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin wrote that \\"there was no reason to believe that the Armenians preferred his control [over Israeli control].\\" In a 2011, meeting with leaders of various Christian communities in Ramallah Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated: \\"The Palestinian leadership sticks to its position that considers the Armenian Quarter an integral part of east Jerusalem, the capital of the independent Palestinian state.\\" (archived, ) According to the Palestine Papers, leaked by Al Jazeera in 2011, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat proposed a geographical division of the Old City at an October 2009 meeting, according to which Israel would acquire sovereignty over the entire Jewish Quarter and \\"part of the Armenian Quarter.\\" (archived, ) =Israeli and Jewish views= Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem (\\"complete and united\\"), including the Old City, is its capital according to the 1980 Jerusalem Law.

He is known for his coverage of the 2014 crisis in Ukraine for VICE News and for Selfie Soldiers, a 2015 documentary in which he re-enacted a Russian soldier's social media posts to track him to Ukraine. He was briefly held hostage by pro-Russia militants there in April 2014. Ostrovsky won an Emmy Award in 2013 for his work with VICE and his series Russian Roulette was nominated for two Emmys. Ostrovsky, who is a Special Correspondent for PBS NewsHour, is also a recipient of the Alfred I. duPont‚ÄìColumbia University Award. Career Ostrovsky started his career in documentary filmmaking in 2007 after spending six years as a print reporter in Russia, where he covered Russia for The Moscow Times and then Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan for the French news agency Agence France-Presse. In 2007, Ostrovsky produced an exclusive report for BBC Newsnight investigating government-sponsored child labor in the cotton industry of Uzbekistan, which a US embassy cable published by Wikileaks credited with reigniting the global campaign against Uzbek cotton. Ostrovsky traced the supply chains of multinational garment retailers like Topshop, Walmart and H&M; to Uzbekistan, leading many Western cotton buyers to eventually boycott the country. In 2009, Ostrovsky exposed the use of North Koreans in work camps in Russia for BBC Newsnight, and linked their operations to the Russian Timber Group, a company owned and operated by the wealthy British Hambro family, which was paying the North Korean regime to use its workers in Russia. He revisited those camps with VICE Media founder Shane Smith in 2011, and co-produced a separate report for VICE's documentary news series on HBO about the escape of defectors from North Korea in 2013.Vice on HBO documentary on North Korean defectors, youtube.com, retrieved April 23, 2014 Ostrovsky has reported extensively on the North Korean practice of sending workers abroad. In a report for the UK's Independent newspaper he described how a \\"North Korean labour force tens-of- thousands strong, put in place across Asia,\\" helped finance the regime in Pyongyang through contracts with Western firms. In 2013, VICE Media hired Ostrovsky as a producer for the second season of VICE on HBO, where he helped the program earn an Emmy as an \\"Outstanding Informational Series.\\" In early 2014, he helped launch the company's new current affairs division, VICE News, with his investigation into allegations of corruption at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and coverage of the 2014 crisis in Ukraine. His series of unvarnished video dispatches from Ukraine titled \\"Russian Roulette\\" won VICE News widespread acclaim and recognition as a burgeoning player on the media landscape. The series was nominated for two Emmys, won two Webby Awards in 2015, the AIB Media Excellence Awards and the Lovie Awards. In 2017 CNN hired Ostrovsky to its expanded investigations unit which also includes veteran investigative journalist Carl Bernstein.

We need a bargaining chip,\\" Ponomarev was quoted as telling The Moscow Times. Ostrovsky was imprisoned for three days, during which he was held in a basement, beaten and interrogated. Ostrovsky described the ordeal as \\"the worst three days of my life\\" in an account he authored for Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper. In the article, Ostrovsky wrote: \\"A hat was pulled over my head and taped over my eyes. My arms were pulled tightly behind my back and taped together too. I was led down a set of stairs and thrown into an empty, damp room ‚Ä¶ I was punched and kicked in the ribs and fell over to the ground.\\" Immediately prior to his detention, Ostrovsky had been investigating Russian citizens' involvement in the pro- Russia armed groups of eastern Ukraine, something separatist forces were trying to hide at that early stage of the conflict, according to a video deposition he made for VICE News following his release. He had also attended several press conferences of Ponomarev where the rebel leader had threatened journalists. He was released on April 24 after his detention garnered considerable global media attention. =Selfie Soldiers= Selfie Soldiers: Russia Checks in to Ukraine is an award-winning 2015 video investigation into the Russian military's presence in Ukraine, reported and produced by Ostrovsky. The documentary follows the steps of a careless Russian army soldier as he travels from Russia to the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, using selfies and other photographs the soldier has himself posted online. Selfie Soldiers departs from other such investigations into soldiers' social media posts when Ostrovsky re-enacts the photos himself to establish clearly that he has personally visited the locations where they were taken inside Ukraine and Russia.

Prosecutors argued that Diar suffocated her son and before setting the house on fire, though the exact cause of Jacob's death was never determined because his body was too badly burned. The jury sentenced her to death. In 2008, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld her conviction but overturned the sentence on the basis that the jury was not informed that a single vote could prevent her from receiving the death penalty. On June 3, 2010, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Nicole Diar was convicted in 2005 of charges she killed her 4-year-old son, Jacob Diar. Jacob Diar's burned remains were found inside of their house in Lorain, Ohio after a house fire that occurred in 2003. Nicole Diar was able to run out of the house to safety but her son was left inside. Diar claimed she tried to save her son from his upstairs bedroom but the smoke was too much. The officers that morning said Diar did not have any soot or smell strongly of smoke as she would if she had tried to save her son during the fire. Jacob's autopsy could not determine cause of death but did suggest that he died before the fire was started due to the lack of soot and evidence of smoke inhalation in his lungs. Judge Kosma Glavas sentenced Diar to the death penalty after it was suggested by the Ohio jury in October 2005. The Ohio Supreme Court overturned her death sentence in 2008 because the Jury was not told ahead of time that just one of them could have changed her death sentence by refusing to consider execution. Diar suggested a bargain to prosecutors where she agreed to spend her life in prison and avoid future legal challenges if her death sentence is overturned. Nicole Diar herself was a burn victim from the age of 4. She suffered burns when her nightgown caught fire and ended up going through a total of 61 surgeries until she was 18. From this, she continued to receive a lump sum every month of $3,000 from a lawsuit against the pajama company. Diar would often leave Jacob at home with young, teen babysitters so she could go out to bars and parties for the night. One babysitter, Luis Agosto, recalls being told to give Jacob a \\"medicine for his hyperactivity\\" so he would get tired and go to sleep decently early. Agosto didn't question it and gave Jacob and his cousin, daughter of Rebecca Diar, Taylor. The two friends of Agosto who were also there that night read the label and pointed out that the medication he gave to the children was Tylenol 3 with codeine prescribed to Taylor. When they informed Diar of this incident, she brushed it off and said Jacob would be okay. Destiny Faulkner also babysat Jacob and could also recall being told to give Jacob this medicine on multiple occasions during the summer of 2003. Faulkner only gave Jacob the medication twice when told but did not on the last time because he was not ill. A pharmacist at the trial confirmed that it was a prescription for Taylor Diar of acetaminophen with codeine. The side effects of this medication can cause drowsiness, upset stomach, and nausea. Nicole and Jacob Diar had been living in an apartment and had recently moved into a rental home in the same town a month prior to the incident. The landlord recalls putting in new smoke detectors and replaced batteries in remaining ones throughout the home before they moved in. On the night of August 26, 2003, Diar wanted to change her locks on her home due to a break-in she told her landlord about. She claimed someone broke into her house and stole the keys and money orders she was supposed to use to pay the rent for that month. Due to that she got help from her neighbor, Leroma Penn, to change her front doorknob lock and add a deadbolt to the backdoor. Diar purposely told Penn to refrain from changing the strike plate on the front door. Although it was sticking, causing trouble opening the door, she wanted to be able to hear if an intruder was trying to get in. Leroma stayed afterwards to have a couple drinks with Diar at her house and went home at 1:00 am. Leroma stated that as she was leaving, Diar went to lay down on the couch with Jacob who had been sleeping there. Leroma said they made plans to do some shopping together in the morning so she called Diar at about 8:00 am but there was no answer. Leroma then heard Diar screaming about an hour after she tried calling. She ran outside to see what was going on and found Diar screaming in front of her house that her house was on fire and could not find Jacob. In popular culture Diar's crimes were profiled on the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women, episode \\"Bury Their Babies\\", originally aired: November 2, 2012.

The genus is near-endemic to Southern Africa, Sceliages augias exceptionally ranging as far north as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Taxonomy Currently seven species are recognised * Sceliages adamastor LePeletier & Serville, 1828 - Cape, Orange Free State * Sceliages augias Gillet, 1908 - Zambia, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo * Sceliages brittoni Zur Strassen, 1965 - Cape * Sceliages difficilis Zur Strassen, 1965 - Zimbabwe, Natal, Transvaal, Gauteng * Sceliages gagates Shipp, 1895 - Mozambique, Natal, Eastern Cape, Swaziland * Sceliages granulatus Forgie & Grebennikov & Scholtz, 2002 - Northern Cape, Botswana * Sceliages hippias Westwood, 1844 - Natal, Transvaal, Mpumalanga Sceliages adamastor The sacred scarab, Scarabaeus sacer Linnaeus (1758), was once idolised by ancient Egyptians as the incarnation of the god Khepri, who guided the sun‚Äôs path across the heavens. The Scarabaeini may have evolved with other scarabaeines during the Cenozoic, stemming from lineages originating in the Lower Cretaceous or possibly as far back as the Lower Jurassic some 180‚Äì200 million years ago. Westwood felt that Ateuchus adamastor (Sceliages adamastor) did not differ enough from Scarabaeus (by an extra pait of spurs on the tibia) to merit generic separation. Ecology Sceliages species have developed special adaptations to disarticulate millipedes - such as the shape of the clypeal margin, in particular the two front ‚Äòteeth‚Äô, and the middle legs. The curvature of the meso tibiae is most evident in S. adamastor, fitting snugly around the circumference of the larger spirobolid, spirostreptid and julid millipedes. The adult male or female beetle straddles the subdued millipede and locks onto it particularly with the mid legs, and uses the front clypeal teeth to prise apart the ring segments of the millipede. Front legs assist in this operation, but the main work is done by the front clypeal teeth. The viscera or gut contents, the legs, and some bits of chitin are then used to form some 1-3 brood-balls depending on the size of the millipede. Brood-balls are prepared in a chamber underground and segment rings are discarded into the burrow. The brood-balls, each with one egg, are coated with a compacted layer of clayey soil to prevent desiccation, and are watched over by the female. Some Cephalodesmius species from Australia introduce additional food supplies as the larva develops, but this is not the case with Sceliages. Sceliages species consume only millipedes (Diplopoda). Utilisation of millipedes by the Scarabaeinae can be both facultative and obligate, and has been documented since 1966, while active predation is recognised in Sceliages and Deltochilum species. Sceliages species are alerted to the presence of injured or freshly-killed millipedes by the smell of quinone-based defensive allomones - the millipedes are then pushed to a suitable site, buried and turned into pear-shaped, soil-encrusted brood-balls.

Ballantyne. The novel first appeared in Volume VI of Young England, an annual magazine published in London from 1880 to 1937. It was then published in paperback by J. Nisbet & Co. This novel was Ballantyne's 79th publication, written in the latter half of his career. The novel is a castaway / survivalist tale. It tells the story of two brothers and a sister who are stranded on one of the many islands of Oceania. The novel's major themes include 19th century British imperialism, the value of Christianity, and the development of social hierarchies. Ballantyne published the novel after having moved from Edinburgh to Harrow, a north London borough, to allow his children to finish school in 1873.  Plot summary  The novel begins with the Rigonda family and two men aboard a castaway ship somewhere in the south Pacific. The family finds a hidden cache of food and they land safely on a nearby island. After finding shelter they set out to explore the island. They soon find that everything they need seems to grow on trees. They explore, hunt wild boar, and construct a signal flag to attract passing ships. During a tremendous storm, an emigrant ship is wrecked on the coral reef just off the island. Otto and Dominick Rigonda run to aid the passengers. The two parties become acquainted and work together to build suitable housing. The men begin offloading supplies and constructing makeshift shelters. The women are charged with caring for the children and establishing a domicile. Dominick and Malines come to blows, which results in Mother Lynch nominating Pauline to be queen. Pauline surprises everyone by naming Joe Binney her prime minister. A few days later, Pauline and Otto are kidnapped by natives and brought aboard their canoe. The colonists give chase and fire a volley at the natives, who allow the children to jump overboard. A few nights later Malines and his co- conspirators are caught preparing to leave the island without the emigrants. The conspirators are marched back to the camp and put in makeshift jails. Dr. Marsh is appointed as judge over the kangaroo court. Queen Pauline surprises the community by pardoning the criminals and offers her hand for them to kiss allegiance. For a time thereafter, there is peace, except for a group of natives hiding in the foliage who are dispatched by the gun-toting colonists. An earthquake strikes suddenly and begins to destroy the colony, and everyone flees in the only intact boat just before the entire island sinks into the sea. The refugees set sail for their original port, but a storm renders the ship unseaworthy once again and they must pull in to a different port. A ship bound for England is docked there and the Rigondas soon arrange for their passage home to England. The novel ends as the children are finally reunited with their parents, who are none too eager to hear their tales of adventure.  Characters  *Dominick Rigonda is the oldest of the three children. He is portrayed as a logical and responsible boy, doing his best to help his siblings survive. *Otto Rigonda is the pert, sometimes overconfident middle child. He uses knowledge that he has gleaned from books to help the family. *Pauline Rigonda is the pretty youngest sister, and is portrayed as very observant and graceful. She undergoes a transformation as the story progresses, becoming wise and regal and settling disputes sensibly. *Malines is the hardened first mate of an emigrant ship. He is strong and handsome, but surly. He is the villain of the story. *Mother Lynch plays the matriarch in the story, dealing with everyday tasks and incidents. She is the nurse and chief caregiver. *Dr. Marsh is deathly ill at the beginning of the story and requires a lot of special care. He and Otto become close friends, and the others respect his judgement.  Genre and style  The story is told through an editorial voice that frequently converses with the reader. The story is narrated in the present tense. There is also a lot of conversation, and Ballantyne advances much of the plot through dialogue. There are strong similarities to earlier Ballantyne novels, and there is a similarity to other stories of the era such as Robinson Crusoe; that is, the main characters are first placed in an unknown or foreign location, where their safety is threatened, before landing on a seemingly deserted island. There is a serious moral tone, but also an exciting story told in an accessible manner via Ballantyne's well-fashioned prose. A terrible outburst from the volcano settled the matter  Researching the setting  Ballantyne became one of the first adventure novelists to conduct background research to develop more realistic settings and descriptions for his novels.\\" The resulting realism helped account for the popularity of his novels.\\" He depicted situations as closely as possible to reality.  Themes  Like many of Ballantyne's juvenile adventure novels, a major theme is Christianity. The characters show varying amounts of religious devotion, and Ballantyne uses direct quotes from the bible. The theme of imperialism, explained by Deborah Anna Logan, arises as the children begin to see themselves as landowners and start to build an empire. Social hierarchies quickly develop, and the children each play a role in the society which they have devised, based on British government. A contrast is shown between shipboard and civilian authority and organisation.  Critical reception  Ballantyne's books contain more details of the local flora and fauna, as well as moralistic dialogue, than is usual in present-day stories. However, his novels were popular with both children and adults. Most critics agree that his books were very well-researched. The London Quarterly Review criticised the book for overemphasising piety out of keeping with the adventurous spirit of the novel. Michelle Elleray also discussed Ballantyne's overt Christianity and pointed out that he used his novels as a way of providing educational and religious material in an entertaining way. She also points out that Ballantyne's child characters were usually quite self- sufficient and self-directed,.\\" having developed their own sense of agency and ability.

Since its initial arcade release in Japan, it received numerous version updates, adjusting system update and adding characters to the roster. Plot In the fictional modern-day setting, a phenomenon called the Hollow Night (Ëôö„Çç„ÅÆÂ§ú utsuro no yoru) has enveloped around Japan once a month for several centuries. Each areas engulfed in the night is beset by shadow-like creatures called Voids (ËôöÁÑ° kyomu (Immortals („Ç§„É¢„Éº„Çø„É´ im≈çtaru) in Japan)). They utilize and feed upon a power known as \\"Existence\\", or EXS („Ç§„Ç∞„Ç∏„Çπ igujisu). Humans cannot sense Voids, but have the potential to perceive them. Those who acquire the perception are targeted by Voids and risk either being consumed by them or losing sanity. Under special circumstances, anyone who maintains sanity after being attacked by a Void can become a being known as an In-Birth („Ç§„É≥„É¥„Ç°„Éº„Çπ invƒÅsu). If a person or even an In-Birth becomes a fallen type of Void, their EXS transforms into FLS („Éï„Ç°„É´„Çπ farusu), the power source of the Voids and the man-made ancient being known as Autonomic Nerves („Ç™„Éº„Éà„Éé„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éä„Éº„É¥ otomatiku neruvƒìsu), powered by Curse Commandment (Âë™Êàí noroikai). While the status places a person into a sort of limbo, they gain the ability to control Existence. Many characters are involved with the phenomenon, and some of them are affiliated with each organizations. Two main rival groups, the Nights Blade (Â§úÂàÄ Yat≈ç) and Licht Kreis, both serve to maintain order in areas affected by the Hollow Night but differ in methods. The now disbanded Nights Blade primarily hunted Voids, while Licht Kreis uses the lawful order and hierarchy to protect normal civilians from In-Births. A third organization, Amnesia, is more structured and seeks to stop the influence of both the Nights Blade and Licht Kreis. Due to an incident involving one of the higher ranking male members of Licht Kreis defecting the Night Blade centuries ago, the group's leader, Adelheid, dismissed all members. They later created their independent organization called Ritter Schild, which mainly specialized in investigating the mysteries behind the Hollow Night. The last organization is the Existence Force Guardians, which specialized on teaching new and In-Births to control their EXS, but forbids them from abusing the ability. As the artificial beings since the ancient time, the Autonomic Nerves units are programmed to watch over the Hollow Night alongside their master. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to Melty Blood, Guilty Gear and Blazblue, with additional gameplay systems introduced for the game. Following the standards of most 2D fighting games, the game focuses on 1v1 battles. The game works under a four-button layout with the four buttons being A- Light Attacks, B- Medium Attacks, C- Strong Attacks, and D- the universal mechanic button. The three normal attack buttons cancel into each other (\\"Passing Link\\"), but these moves retroactively can be cancelled with a technique called reverse beat. This causes moves with high amounts of recovery frames to cancel into a move with less recovery frames. Each character has their own unique special, input-based moves and character specifics Force Function move done by pressing B+C together that are character-specific. The A+D button combination is the universal throw technique and specific characters also have another ability tied to pressing A+B together while it is also another option to use a universal dash when held forward along with the button combination. The game does not have traditional \\"air-dashes\\" and instead has an angled hop that acts as \\"double jump\\", barring certain characters. The super meter, referred to as the EXS gauge, fills up whenever a player lands an attack or is hit by an opponent. The special moves when used with the C-button without 50% of meter will use the B-version of the attack while when the meter is sufficient, a powered up EX version of the move will be used instead with extra properties or more damaging effects. When the super meter is at 100%, characters can utilize their Infinite Worths for high damaging techniques that are the strongest moves they possess. A stronger version can be utilized when their health is below 30% where pressing all four buttons will activate their Infinite Worth EXS which causes high damage for all characters. A technique called Veil Off can be utilized if a character has above 50% meter where, after a slight invulnerable state and blockable \\"burst\\" occurs, the character enters a powered up state where they are able to do more damage as well as utilize their rapidly draining super meter without limitations, aside from 30% health requirement for IWEXS. The main feature associates with the fourth D-Button correlates with the mechanic known as the Grind Grid that dictates the flow of the match. Situated in the bottom middle of the screen between the two players' super meters, the GrD Gauge is the \\"tug of war\\" mechanic that rewards both offensive and defensive play. As the circular timer on the GrD Gauge approaches a full revolution, the actions of the players influence the amount of GrD Blocks they obtain in a GrD cycle. Landing attacks, walking forward, landing throws, taking throws, and blocking the enemy's attacks will reward GrD Blocks while getting hit, walking backwards, whiffing throws, and getting grabbed will deplete GrD. At the end of the cycle, whichever player has the most GrD blocks will be granted with a temporary buff called Vorpal State. The character with Vorpal will glow blue, have a 10% damage buff, gain access to character specific Vorpal Traits, and be allowed to use an active cancel known as Chain Shift. Utilizing Chain Shift will consume the current Vorpal State buff, freeze the screen for a quick duration, and reset the character who used it back into a neutral state and converting any GrD Blocks into extra super meter charge. It is in the players' best interest to seize Vorpal State as often as possible to gain the most advantages it brings. From there, the D-button influences the GrD Gauge for the player's use in influencing the GrD Cycles. Holding down D will have the characters \\"Concentrate\\" which will accrue GrD Blocks in exchange for super meter, although it can be done without meter. Forward and D is an \\"Assault\\", a jumping forward air dash-like that gives a GrD Block and issue a command jump where its distance is calculated relative to the player's proximity to the opponent character leading into offensive pressure. \\"Ground Assaults\\" will never jump over the opponent while \\"Air Assaults\\" can. \\"Air Assault\\" can also be done via traditional Air Dash input, which is tap forward twice. Holding back and D activates \\"Shield\\" which is an advanced guard that is essentially the barrier block or push-block mechanic from other titles. There are two types of Shield techniques, one being the regular \\"Shield Block\\" and other being \\"Guard Shield\\". Both fulfil the same purpose in pushing away opponents who are mounting an offensive, gaining frame advantage after shielding an unsafe move, and granting GrD to the defending player but Guard Shield is utilized if the player presses D as they are blocking after an attack lands. While gaining GrD, Guard Shields costs meter to utilize and quick usages of Shield Blocking is generally more advantageous. Guard Shields are colored green while shield blocking is blue. If the player gets hit or thrown while activating the Shield, they enter \\"GrD Break Status\\" where they temporarily lose all previous abilities granted by the D-Button. The player has the option to \\"Guard Thrust\\" where they either utilize 50% of their meter and forcibly enter GrD Break status to launch a fully invincible attack to knock the opponent away to reset the pace of the match or expend their Vorpal State. GrD Breaking also applies if a character is hit with the burst from a Veil Off or if a character utilizes their IWEXS without Vorpal. [st] added a new feature known as \\"Cross-Cast Veil Off\\" where if a character has more than 50% meter and Vorpal, they can cancel into an alternate version of Veil Off where they can chain together EX moves and utilize their IW/IWEXS should they meet the requirements. =Characters= While the game has the same playable characters on a few updates, Sion Eltnam Atlasia (Eltnum) in Melty Blood and Akatsuki in Akatsuki Blitzkampf made guest appearances. They were only played by Japanese voice actors.

Development The game began development in 2010. Nobuya Narita discussed how the project arose from the team's experiences working on Melty Blood. French-Bread originally planned to work on the high-definition title for the game, but development later stalled while Type-Moon went on to work on Mah≈çtsukai no Yoru. Early prototypes provided the foundation for the game. Narita particularly emphasized that they wanted to differentiate the game from Melty Blood, so the lore, visuals, systems and combat flow are much different from the previous work. It is also the team's first game to run in high definition and features hand-drawn high-resolution sprites.

The fuel from their works and their iron products bootstrapped the industrial revolution in the northeast seacoast population centers from Boston to Norfolk, VA. There are two types of coal found in Pennsylvania: anthracite (the ‚Äúhard coal‚Äù found in Northeastern Pennsylvania below the Allegheny Ridge southwest to Harrisburg; also called ‚Äústone coal‚Äù, ‚Äúrock coal‚Äù in the 1800s) and bituminous (‚Äúsoft coal‚Äù, found west of the Allegheny Front escarpment). Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon and energy content that gives off light and heat (produced energy) when burned, making it useful as a fuel. It was possibly first used in Pennsylvania as a fuel in 1769, but its real history begins with a documented discovery near Summit Hill and the founding of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company in 1792 to sporadically send expeditions to the wilderness atop Pisgah Ridge to mine the deposits, mostly with notable lack of great success, over the next 22 years. The owners of this company were absentee management‚Äîreliant on teams of workers sent under a foreman to fell timber to build so called 'Arks' (high- sided punts), then mine coal around nine miles (today's Summit Hill) from the right bank Lehigh (the Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike terminus at Mauch Chunk), then trek with mule loads to fill the boats for the trip down the rapid strewn Lehigh River,(Brenckman, p. 595-597) and then more than to Philadelphia docks on the unimproved often log choked (Bartholomew, p. 4‚Äì5) Delaware River.(Bartholomew, p. 4) About 1790 the nation's first energy crisis became evident even in smaller towns‚Äîthe forests needed for charcoal for smelting and other manufacturing, and stands of wood for heating fire wood were quickly vanishing, farther and farther from population centers. Transport of wood or an alternative fuel became very important to people, and bituminous was cheaper to import from England than 'chancy, unreliable' anthracite was to buy in Philadelphia. Suffering through British navy blockades through during the war, industrialist Josiah White set his mill supervisors the task of experimenting with Anthracite to get to ignite and burn in a useful way. In 1813, the first mining actually in the Lehigh Valley was begun at Beaver Meadows, however, because of the various struggles getting it the to Philadelphia and because it is far more difficult to ignite Anthracite with its sporadic and unreliable supply, it did not come to be generally used regularly until after the War of 1812;. Industrialists Hazard and White showed the way. The developments of the canal and then railroad system made transporting the anthracite exponentially easier, and by the 1860s anthracite coal was regularly supplying urban centers like Philadelphia and New York City and was helping to fuel the American Industrial Revolution.  Geology  Anthracite and bituminous coal were formed in the eastern and western regions of Pennsylvania respectively during the Pennsylvanian time in the Carboniferous Geological Period (‚ÄúHistory of Anthracite Coal Mining‚Äù). The Pennsylvania Anthracite Region is in the Valley and Ridge Province of the Appalachian Mountains, with the coal located in the folded and faulted terrain of the Province. The anthracite fields are maintained in synclinal basins that are surrounded by sandstone ridges, which help to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the anthracite (Hornberger et al., 20-2). There are four different anthracite coalfields in Pennsylvania, all located on the eastern side of the state. The Northern field is located predominantly in the Luzerne, Lackawanna, Susquehanna and Wayne Counties; the Western Middle field in Northumberland, Columbia, and Schuylkill Counties; Eastern Middle field mainly in Luzerne County but extending into Schuylkill, Carbon, and Columbia Counties; the Southern field in Carbon, Schuylkill, Lebanon, and Dauphin Counties (Latzko, 8). Anthracite differs from bituminous in usage in that it has better heat quality and fewer disadvantageous by-products, but it has higher carbon content and is therefore harder to ignite and requires a grate to separate the ashes from the burning coal (Day, 371).  Early Detection of Coal  One of the earliest mentions that coal might be found in the Pennsylvania area dates back to 1698, when Gabriel Thomas wrote an account dedicated to William Penn. He notes the possibility of coal because the running water had the same coloring as the water in the coalmines in Wales (Hoffman, 353). The actual presence of coal is first recorded on a map made in 1753 by John Pattin, an Indian trader, although it is possible he did not detect the coal first hand, but rather heard about it from other traders (Edmunds, 1). Soon after, in 1754, George Washington led an expedition across the Allegheny Mountains, and his second- in-command wrote a letter detailing an abundance of natural luxuries including coal in the western region of Pennsylvania (Hoffman, 353). Then in 1761, the first actual Pennsylvania coalmine is recorded on the ‚ÄúPlan of Fort Pitts and Parts Adjacent‚Äù map. The bituminous mine was located in Fort Pitt near the top of Coal Hill, which is now downtown Pittsburgh (Edmunds, 2). Anthracite coal was first found in 1762, and then was used for the first time around 1769 by Obadiah Gore and his brother in their blacksmith shop in Wilkes-Barre. However, coal usage was generally restricted to local consumption need until the industry began to expand at the turn of the 19th century (Latzko, 3).  Early History of Coal Mining  The Lehigh Coal Mine Company first used coal commercially in 1792. The company was founded after German immigrant Philip Ginder discovered beds of the anthracite ‚Äústone coal‚Äù near Summit Hill in 1791 while out hunting (Carr). A wealthy landowner named Jacob Weiss provided the capital to form the Lehigh Coal Mine Company with other businessmen from Philadelphia. The company had a slow start because of the difficulty in igniting anthracite coal and the inability to transfer the coal to urban markets (Dublin, Licht, 11). Judge Jesse Fell of Wilkes-Barre discovered a solution to ignite anthracite in 1808 with the usage of an iron grate that allowed the coal to light and burn easier. Demand for the anthracite coal increased slightly (Dublin, Licht, 12). Brothers Abijah and John Smith were the first to successfully transport hard coal when they moved 50 tons on an ark down the Susquehanna River to Columbia in 1807 (Latzko, 3).  War of 1812  In 1810, 350 tons of anthracite was mined in Pennsylvania. The use of anthracite coal was restricted due to the difficulties in transporting it efficiently, and the industry was still small and undeveloped (Latzko, 3). The War of 1812 against Great Britain increased the usage of anthracite coal. Prior to the war, citizens of the nation's urban centers such as New York and Philadelphia received most of their coal fuel needs from Britain and Virginia's bituminous coal supplies (Dublin, Licht, 12). During the war the British blockade of American ports severely limited the supply of British bituminous fuel reaching the US, and there was also a shortage in Virginia's supply resulting in a fuel crisis (Adams, ‚ÄúWarming the Poor,‚Äù 76). Before the war citizens did not like to use anthracite coal because it was difficult to ignite and maintain, but the wartime shortage forced them to start using anthracite. Jacob Cist of Wilkes-Barre promoted the use of anthracite during and after the War of 1812. Jacob Cist's father was a major investor in the Lehigh Coal Mine Company, so Cist began to transport the company's coal to Philadelphia by the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers (Dublin, Licht, 12). Once in Philadelphia, he used testimonials and public demonstrations to negate the stereotype of anthracite and convince Philadelphia society that the hard coal could be used as a replacement for bituminous coal (Adams, ‚ÄúWarming the Poor,‚Äù 81). Cist and other advocates including the Pennsylvania state legislature and government officials continued to promote the anthracite, and the War of 1812 was able to open the way for Pennsylvania anthracite coal to outdo Virginia's bituminous‚Äô share of the market (Day, 371).  Canals  With the opening of the major canals Lehigh, Schuylkill, and Delaware & Hudson in addition to smaller ones such as the Delaware Division and Morris Canals, canal companies successfully provided urban markets for anthracite coal (Latzko, 3). The anthracite commercial market greatly expanded, and the hard coal was used as valuable fuel for heating and cooking domestically, as well as energy sources for small businesses such as blacksmiths, brewers, bakers, and manufacturers (Adams, ‚ÄúUS Coal Industry‚Äù). = Lehigh Canal = Joseph White and Erskine Hazard founded the Lehigh Navigation Company in 1818. They wanted to use rivers to more efficiently transport anthracite coal. After they were declined a charter to the Schuylkill River, they tried to receive a charter for the Lehigh River. The Lehigh River was located near the Summit Hill Mine, which was mined and operated by the Lehigh Coal Mine Company. Joseph White and Erskine Hazard made a partnership between their company and the Lehigh Coal Mine Company to form the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, which was incorporated in 1822. They received a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature giving them the right to improve navigation on the Lehigh River, which effectively granted them a monopoly over the Lehigh. White and Hazard ordered the construction of a roadway to link the Summit Hill Mine and the Lehigh River, and then ordered the building of a canal. By 1840, over 250,000 tons of anthracite mined from the region annually reached Philadelphia through White and Hazard's Lehigh River system (Dublin, Licht, 12-3). = Schuylkill Canal = A group of Germans wanted to seek the rights to the Schuylkill River. They received a charter in 1815 to incorporate the Schuylkill Navigation Company, which would have control over the Schuylkill River. After receiving investors the Schuylkill Navigation Company was able to finance a 108-mile long river and canal system that connected the Pottsville area to Philadelphia that opened in 1825. By the early 1840s, some 500,000 tons of anthracite coal was being transported annually to Philadelphia using the Schuylkill River (Dublin, Licht, 13) = Delaware & Hudson Canal = The Wurts brothers, William and Maurice, owned coalfields in the northeastern Pennsylvania anthracite region, but found an unresponsive market in Philadelphia, which was receiving coal from the Schuylkill and Lehigh routes. They saw business potential in finding a connection route between anthracite fields and the New York City market, and so they had the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company incorporated in 1823 (Sciaky, 275-6). The D&H; Company built a canal system across parts of the Delaware and Hudson Rivers that stretched from Honesdale, PA to Rondout, NY, which was completed in 1828 (‚ÄúDelaware and Hudson‚Äù).  The Railway  The rise of the railway system expanded the anthracite coal industry. The D&H; Company was one of the first to attempt the use of steam locomotives in America. They purchased a locomotive from England so they could transport coal from the mines to their canal, and tested it on a railroad track in 1829. The locomotive ultimately failed, as it was too heavy for the wooden track, but demand was sparked for lighter locomotives that could transport coal from the mines to the canals (‚ÄúDelaware and Hudson‚Äù). Locomotives that solely transported coal from mines to canal entries were in use in the 1830s, but goals were set to use railroads to bypass canals all together. In 1855 Asa Packer opened the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) to compete with the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company's monopoly. The LVRR would eventually link the Mauch Chunk area of Pennsylvania all the way through New Jersey to NYC. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was opened in 1839 connecting Reading, PA in the southern anthracite region to Philadelphia. Through acquisitions it eventually went north to the Schuylkill field and east towards the Lehigh region. It faced competition with the Schuylkill Navigation Company, until the Reading Railroad eventually leased out the Schuylkill Navigation Company in 1870. The Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad would become the major carrier of anthracite from the northern fields to NYC (Dublin, Licht, 15‚Äì17). While the extensive railroad systems made transporting more efficient, they also lowered the price of coal in distant markets such as Philadelphia and NYC relative to the prices in areas surrounding the mines. In 1840 the wholesale price of anthracite in Philadelphia relative to the mine price was 3.6, and by 1864 the ratio was 1.3. A similar drop occurred with the New York prices (Latzko, 17).  The Iron Industry  The usage of anthracite coal in the iron industry increased demand for hard coal. Since the late 18th century coke (bituminous coal with the impurities burned away) was used as fuel to make iron in Britain. With the spread of popularity of anthracite in the early 19th century, iron makers began experimenting with using anthracite as fuel in iron production. It wasn't until 1840 when David Thomas introduced Welsh hot blast technology to the Lehigh Crane Iron Company that anthracite was successfully used to smelt iron. It was indicated that using anthracite saved up to 25% in the production of iron, and that the quality of the iron was also superior (Adams, ‚ÄúUS Coal Industry‚Äù). By the 1850s anthracite was used in the manufacture of about half of all crude iron produced in the US. The increased efficiency of anthracite heat was also instrumental in the manufacture of metal machinery and the transformation of water into steam for machinery power (Dublin, Licht, 17).  Civil War Period  The Civil War created a shift in the makeup of the anthracite coal industry. Prior to the war, the industry involved many small-scale mines with short-term leases resulting in increasing production levels but an overall trend of falling prices. In 1830 anthracite coal was selling for $11 per ton, in 1840 it was $7 per ton, and by 1860 it was $5.50 a ton in NYC, while total production was increasing (Adams, ‚ÄúUS Coal Industry‚Äù). This was due in part to a general anti-charter sentiment towards the coal industry by the Pennsylvania state government, making it difficult for coal corporations to receive charters (Adams, ‚ÄúDifferent Charters‚Äù), as well as a seasonal market that experienced fluctuation in demand for anthracite (Dublin, Licht, 17). The onset of the war brought an increased need for fuel for the army, and in turn an expected increase in demand for coal. The boom of investment in the coal industry and predicted large-scale production of anthracite coal shifted the mentality of the Pennsylvania state government, and the legislature dramatically increased the number and quality of charters it granted to mining companies (Adams, ‚ÄúDifferent Charters‚Äù). Individual proprietors fell to the expansion of corporations who could master the large-scale production and efficient transportation that the wartime economy called for. The major railroad companies came to dominate the industry as they began to purchase coalfields in order to control both the production and shipping aspects. With increased concentration of capital among the smaller number of operations they were able to create deeper and deeper mining shafts to reach new levels of coal (Dublin, Licht, 18-9). By the end of the 19th century the Pennsylvania anthracite industry was controlled by a handful of major railroad corporations.

It premiered on April 20, 2014, on Fox and aired on April 21, 2014, on National Geographic Channel. The episode explores the methods and processes used to measure the age of the Earth. The episode also pays tribute to geochemist Clair Patterson (voiced by Richard Gere) in his quest to remove the neurotoxin, lead, from gasoline. The episode's title alludes to Patterson's attempts in sterilizing his lab after realizing that the inconsistent results in his experiments were due to lead contamination. The episode received a 1.4/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 3.74 million American viewers watching on Fox.  Episode summary  The episode describes how science, in particular the work of Clair Patterson (voiced in animated sequences by Richard Gere) in the middle of the 20th century, has been able to determine the age of the Earth. Tyson first describes how the Earth was formed from the coalescence of matter some millions of years after the formation of the Sun, and while scientists can examine the formations in rock stratum to date some geological events, these can only trace back millions of years. Instead, scientists have used the debris from meteor impacts, such as the Meteor Crater in Arizona, knowing that the material from such meteors coming from the asteroid belt would have been made at the same time as the Earth. Tyson then outlines the work Patterson did as a graduate under his adviser Harrison Brown to provide an accurate count of lead in zircon particles from Meteor Crater, and to work with similar results being collected by George Tilton on uranium counts; with the established half-life of uranium's radioactive decay to lead, this would be used to estimate the age of the Earth. Patterson found that his results were contaminated by lead from the ambient environment, compared to Tilton's results, and required the construction of the first ultra-high cleanroom to remove all traces of environmental lead. With these clean results, Patterson was able to estimate the age of the Earth to 4.5 billion years. Tyson goes on to explain that Patterson's work in performing lead-free experiments directed him to investigate the sources for lead. Tyson notes how lead does not naturally occur at Earth's surface but has been readily mined by humans (including the Roman Empire), and that lead is poisonous to humans. Patterson examined the levels of lead in the common environment and in deeper parts of the oceans and Antarctic ice, showing that lead had only been brought to the surface in recent times. He would discover that the higher levels of lead were from the use of tetraethyllead in leaded gasoline, despite long-established claims by Robert A. Kehoe and others that this chemical was safe. Patterson would continue to campaign against the use of lead, ultimately resulting in government-mandated restrictions on the use of lead. Tyson ends by noting that similar work by scientists continues to be used to help alert mankind to other fateful issues that can be identified by the study of nature.  Reception  The episode's premiere on Fox brought a 1.4/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with an audience of 3.74 million American viewers. It placed fourth and last in its timeslot behind The Good Wife, In My Dreams, and Believe; and eighth out of seventeenth for the night.

The film stars Yash in leading role along with Amulya and Anant Nag. The film also prominently features an elephant named Arjuna from Waynad, Kerala. Actor Prakash Raj plays as narrator for the film to introduce Yash's character. Also uncredited writer Sai Prasad did the still photography and concept design for the making of the movie. This film is also dubbed in Hindi as Gajakeasari:The Big Lion. Plot The film begins in the forest area of Aanegudde, an elephant reserve. A state minister arrives at the place of a local don, Rana. Rana forces the minister to sign a deal to open a resort at Anegudde. The minister signs reluctantly after seeing his bodyguard being murdered by Rana. The scene next shifts to Prakash Raj introducing an ancient temple in the royal city of mysore called \\"Shankara Narayana\\" temple which is being managed by a holy Muth (holy association), headed by the pontiff (Anantnag). The Muth has a very good reputation by not being involved into any politics and also being equally revered by both Shaivites and Vaishnavites. Then comes into picture, the hero Krishna (Yash), with his mother Girija Lokesh. Krishna is a happy-go-lucky youth, a hard-core Rajkumar fan, who has a kind heart for people and is involved in a small-time loan financing company. It is revealed that Krishna‚Äôs family is very much devoted to the Muth and also that he was born after Krishna‚Äôs father pledged that Krishna will be sent to become the next Pontiff of the Muth after Anantnag. In this context, Krishna is given a warm welcome at the Muth and is requested by the Muth head Anantnag to take up the spiritual leadership. Krishna refuses as he feels he is still attached to the worldly ambitions and he requests the pontiff to suggest an alternative. The Pontiff says that Krishna has to donate an elephant to the Muth, if he cannot take up the leadership of the Muth. Krishna first tries several ways to avoid taking up Sanyasa ashramam in various negative ways, but each time in his attempt, he is given full respect and protected. Krishna finally goes in search of the elephant and hence sets his foot in the forest of Aaneguddi. He takes the help of the local Forest officer \\"Agni\\" (Rangayana Raghu) who introduces him to the forest tribal people. The ancestors of these tribal people have been in that forest since centuries and have taken care of the local elephants. They befriend Krishna and some incidents make Krishna meet a single strong elephant \\"Kalinga\\", who is feared by the tribal folk for his roughness. Krishna also meets a young ecologist (Amulya). The local don Rana hatches a plan to route out the local tribal folk from their homes and build a resort there. When he comes there with his henchmen, Krishna and Amoolya revolt and help the folk. Krishna fights the henchmen and creates fear in the mind of Rana. Rana takes his right-hand man Selva to kill Krishna and at this juncture, the elephant Kalinga comes to his rescue. The head of the tribal folk sees Krishna reducing the anger of Kalinga and deduces that he is definitely the incarnation of Baahubali (Yash), a fierce warrior in the army of the King of Karunadu. The tribal chief then narrates the story about the valour of Baahubali. The king of Karunadu is about to be attacked by a king Verma. At this juncture, Baahubali defeats one of the strongest warriors of Verma. Saddened at this, Verma resorts to a cunning way and makes Baahubali‚Äôs close friend poison Baahubali. When he is poisoned, Verma attacks him with his army along with the traitor minister of Karunadu. In spite of his dying state, Baahubali single-handedly defeats the entire army of Verma and kills them. In this fight, Baahubali loses his pet elephant \\"Balarama\\" (this is the elephant which has incarnated as Kalinga), who kills some of the enemy soldiers and dies. Finally, Baahubali dies and the king of Karunadu awards the title of \\"Gajakesari\\" to Baahubali for his meritorious act of bravery and his service to the Motherland. Now, Krishna having known his past life, faces Rana and his henchmen and is almost killed. The Pontiff Anantnag having sensed Krishna‚Äôs battle for life, performs Mrityunjaya Homa at the Muth. This ritual strengthens Krishna and Kalinga aids him to finish off Rana and the henchmen. Finally, the Muth Pontiff arrives at the tribal village and tells Krishna that it was his destiny that he had to help the village tribal people and that he has to continue to protect them as he did in his previous birth. The Pontiff also tells him that he need not become the next successor to him nor donate any elephant to the Muth. He blesses Krishna to marry Meera(Amulya) and lead a prosperous life.

Colonial era There was a small Catholic population in the English colonies, chiefly in Maryland. It supported local schools, often under Jesuit auspices. The small Catholic Spanish communities in New Mexico and California, which joined the United States in 1848, had little in the way of organized schooling. Much more important were schools of New Orleans, under Spanish and French control until 1803. Well-to-do families sent their children to private Catholic schools run by Ursulines and other orders of nuns. The Sisters of the Holy Family brought literacy and training in job skills to both free and enslaved black girls.Donna Porche-Frilot and Petra Munro Hendry, \\"'Whatever Diversity of Shade May Appear': Catholic Women Religious Educators in Louisiana, 1727-1862,\\" Catholic Southwest (2010) 21: 34-62. The earliest continually operating school for girls in the United States is Ursuline Academy in New Orleans. It was founded in 1727 by the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula. The Academy graduated the first female pharmacist, and the first woman to contribute a book of literary merit. It contained the first convent. It was the first free school and first retreat center for ladies, and first classes for female African-American slaves, free women of color, and Native Americans. In the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, Ursulines provided the first center of social welfare in the Mississippi Valley, first boarding school in Louisiana and the first school of music in New Orleans.Robenstine Clark, \\"French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century,\\" History of Education Quarterly (1992) 32#2 pp. 193-211 in JSTOR Parochial schools As the nation was mostly Protestant in the 19th century, there was anti-Catholic sentiment related to heavy immigration from Catholic Ireland after the 1840s, and a feeling that Catholic children should be educated in public schools to become American. In the 1880s most states passed a constitutional amendment, called Blaine Amendments, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools, which affected also Lutherans and other denominations that operated schools. By 1890 the Irish, who controlled the Church in the U.S., had built an extensive network of parishes and parish schools (\\"parochial schools\\") across the urban Northeast and Midwest. The Irish and other Catholic ethnic groups looked to parochial schools not only to protect their religion, but to enhance their culture and language.Timothy Walch, Parish School: American Catholic Parochial Education From Colonial Times to the Present (2003)James J. Hennesey, American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States (1983) p 172 The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by strong opposition to any public funding of parochial schools.Thomas E. Buckley, \\"A Mandate for Anti- Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment,\\" America 27 September 2004, 18‚Äì21. The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers. In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the Catholic Educational Association which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.Jay P. Dolan, The American Catholic Experience (1985) pp 262-74 In the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and fewer well- trained teachers.Jay P. Dolan, The American Catholic Experience (1985) pp 286-91James W. Sanders, The Education of an urban Minority: Catholics in Chicago, 1833‚Äì1965 (Oxford University Press, 1977). The number of schools and students grew apace with the taxpayer-funded public schools. In 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1.8 million pupils taught by 42,000 teachers, the great majority of whom were nuns. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation.David P. Baker, \\"Schooling All the Masses: Reconsidering the Origins of American Schooling in the Postbellum Era,\\" Sociology of Education (1999) 72#4 pp. 197-215 in JSTOR For more than two generations, enrollment climbed steadily. By the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools. The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.Andrew M. Greeley, et al. Catholic Schools and a Declining Church (1976) ch 2 A major transition took place in the 1970s as most of the teaching nuns left their orders. Many schools closed, others replaced the nuns with much better paid lay teachers and started charging higher tuition.Michael P.

They often sent their children to parochial schools and encouraged their young women to become nuns and teachers. In 1932 close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.see pp 59-60 Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college. In Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes.Thomas I. Monzell, \\"The Catholic Church and the Americanization of the Polish Immigrant,\\" Polish American Studies (1969) 26#1 pp. 1-15 in JSTOR =Supreme Court upholds parochial schools= In 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act. The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In Pierce v.

It is the oldest Catholic law school in the Southwest. =Chaminade University of Honolulu= Established in 1955. =The Catholic University of America= The proposal to create a national Catholic university in America reflected the rising size and influence of the nation's Catholic population and also an ambitious vision of the Church's role in American life during the 19th century.C. Joseph Nuesse, The Catholic university of America: A centennial history (Catholic University of America Press, 1990) ch 1 In 1882 Bishop John Lancaster Spalding went to Rome to obtain Pope Leo XIII's support for the University and persuaded family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it. On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical \\"Magni Nobis\\", granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of Catholicism and human nature together at the graduate level. By developing new leaders and new knowledge, the University would strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States. Many of the founders of the CUA held a vision that included both a sense of the Church's special role in United States and also a conviction that scientific and humanistic research, informed by the Faith, would only strengthen the Church. They sought to develop an institution like a national university that would promote the Faith in a context of religious freedom, spiritual pluralism, and intellectual rigor. Pope Pius XI and P. Card. Gasparri, \\"The Catholic University of America,\\" Catholic Historical Review (1929) 14#4 pp. 477-484 in JSTOR When the University first opened for classes in the fall of 1888, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and moral philosophy, English literature, the Sacred Scriptures, and the various branches of theology. At the end of the second term, lectures on canon law were added and the first students were graduated in 1889. In 1904, an undergraduate program was added and it quickly established a reputation for excellence.The president of the first undergraduate class was Frank Kuntz, whose memoir of that period was published by the University press: Frank Kuntz, Undergraduate Days: 1904‚Äì1908 (CUA 1958). =Women's colleges= The Catholics founded numerous colleges for women. The first was the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, which opened elementary and secondary schools in Baltimore in 1873 and a four-year college in 1895. It added graduate programs in the 1980s that accepted men and is now Notre Dame of Maryland University.Bridget Marie Engelmeyer, \\"A Maryland First,\\" Maryland Historical Magazine (1993) 78#3 pp186-204 Another 42 women's colleges opened by 1925; by 1955, there were 116 Catholic colleges for women. Most‚Äîbut not all most of them‚Äîwent co-ed, merged or closed after 1970. =The ACCU= The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899 and continues to facilitate the exchange of information and methods. Vigorous debate in recent decades has focused on how to balance Catholic and academic roles, with conservatives arguing that bishops should exert more control to guarantee orthodoxy.John Rodden, \\"Less 'Catholic,' More 'catholic'?

Mesembria (; ) was an important Greek city in ancient Thrace. It was situated on the coast of the Euxine and at the foot of Mount Haemus;Scymn. Ch. consequently upon the confines of Moesia, in which it is placed by Ptolemy. Strabo relates that it was a colony of Dorians from Megara, and that it was originally called Menebria (ŒúŒµŒΩŒµŒ≤œÅŒØŒ±) after its founder Menas; Stephanus of Byzantium says that its original name was Melsembria (ŒúŒµŒªœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ≤œÅŒØŒ±), from its founder Melsas; and both writers state that the termination -bria was the Thracian word for town. According to the Anonymous Periplus of the Euxine Sea, Mesembria was founded by Chalcedonians at the time of the expedition of Darius against Scythia; but according to Herodotus it was founded a little later, after the suppression of the Ionic Revolt, by fugitives from Byzantium and Chalcedon. These statements may, however, be reconciled by supposing that the Thracian town was originally colonized by Megarians, and afterwards received additional colonists from Byzantium and Chalcedon. Mesembria was one of the cities, forming the Greek Pentapolis on the Euxine, the other four being Odessus, Tomi, Istriani and Apolloniatae. Mesembria is rarely mentioned in history, but it continued to exist till a late period, being recorded by Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy, and appearing in the Peutinger Table.Tab. Peut. The Dorian colonisation is dated to the beginning of the 6th century BCE, and evidence shows that it was an important trading centre from then on and a rival of Apollonia (Sozopol). It remained the only Dorian colony along the Black Sea coast, as the rest were typical Ionian colonies. At 425/4 BCE the town joined the Delian League, under the leadership of Athens. Archaeology 305x305px Bulgarian archaeologist Lyuba Ognenova-Marinova led six underwater archaeological expeditions for the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) between 1961 and 1972 in the waters along the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Her work led to the identification of five chronological periods of urbanization on the peninsula surrounding Nesebar through the end of the second millennium BCE, which included the Thracian protopolis, the Greek colony Mesambria, a Roman-ruled village to the Early Christian Era, the Medieval settlement and a Renaissance era town, known as Mesemvria or Nessebar. Remains date mostly from the Hellenistic period and include the acropolis, a temple of Apollo and an agora. A wall which formed part of the Thracian fortifications can still be seen on the north side of the peninsula. Bronze and silver coins were minted in the city since the 5th century BCE and gold coins since the 3rd century BCE. The town fell under Roman rule in 71 BCE, yet continued to enjoy privileges such as the right to mint its own coinage.

It runs from Srinagar in the Kashmir Valley southward to the city of Jammu. It is one of the two road links (the other being the Mughal Road) that connects the Kashmir Valley with the rest of India. The traffic on the highway is controlled by two control rooms, one in Srinagar and the other in Jammu. __TOC__ Features Jammu Srinagar National Highway The highway starts from Lal Chowk, Srinagar and passes through Pulwama district, Anantnag district, Kulgam district, Ramban district, and Udhampur district, and ends in Jammu city. The highway lies in the Kashmir valley for the first 68 km (up to Qazigund), then passes through a series of mountains up to Jammu. In the mountains, the highway is often closed for days during winter due to heavy snowfall and the resulting landslides and avalanches. =Improvements= The government of Jammu and Kashmir maintains and improves the highway. At many sites, new and straighter roadbeds make the journey more comfortable and shorter. Notably, tunnels, such as the Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel and the Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel have reduced the distance between Jammu and Srinagar (formerly 295 km) by about 40 km and will minimize winter closures. Notable attractions along the route are the mountaintop park at Patnitop and the town of Kud with its sweets shops that make \\"desi ghee patisa\\". These are reached by following the old NH 44 rather than taking the Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel. =Alternatives= A railway line runs from Baramulla at the western end of the Kashmir Valley, to the south end of Srinagar, and reaches Banihal south of the Pir Panjal Range via the Banihar Railway Tunnel, India's longest railway tunnel, at . The railway has eased traffic on the highway. The distance between Qazigund, north of the Pir Panjal Range, and Banihal, south of the range, is 35 km by road but only 17 km by railway, and may cut time and costs by three-quarters. From Banihal, there is bus service south to Udhampur and Jammu. Traffic control rooms Traffic on the highway is controlled by traffic control rooms in the two capital cities. Personnel at either control room can provide road conditions and give recommendations on the advisability of travel. * The contact number of Traffic control room Srinagar is 01942450022 and * The contact number of Traffic control room Jammu is 01942459048. *The contact number of \\"Traffic control room Pulwama\\" is 01933247369. Hazards Weather remains a travel hazard. In February 2019, incessant rain caused avalanches and landslides at several points in the mountains. This closed the highway for a week, leading to rationing of petrol and diesel fuel throughout the Kashmir Valley. When such hazards occur, the control rooms sometimes prevent vehicles from beginning a journey. Vehicles already on the highway might not be able to proceed, or might proceed only in single file or with an escort vehicle. Travelers may have to make spontaneous arrangements for overnight stays.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 18, 2014. It was written by Billy Kimball and Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Timothy Bailey. In the episode, Bart feels guilty after he wins the annual \\"last day of school\\" race around Springfield Elementary School, with help from Nelson, who beats up the frontrunner, Milhouse. Meanwhile, Homer tries to bring back Fourth of July fireworks after they are cancelled due to budget cuts. Plot In celebration of the last day of school, Bart wakes up the family by banging pots and pans together. Even though Homer initially says that he has a plan of making Bart go to summer camp, Marge points out it is a prison road crew in the picture. Bart interjects that he did that last summer, and he is not allowed back. The family convenes in the kitchen, where Homer discovers, while reading the local newspaper, that the Fourth of July fireworks has been cancelled, due to the fact that the city is broke. Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary has their annual Field Day festivities, where kids learn to balance eggs on spatulas and have their ankles tied to someone who does not care two cents about them. The race around the school prompts everyone to do their best, including Milhouse, who has been practising for this race. Milhouse reveals to Bart he has been training, but Martin overhears this secret. Martin then wagers his money on Milhouse to win, potentially bankrupting the bullies because of the tremendously long odds against Milhouse. As each student runs during the race, Milhouse leads the pack before Nelson and the bullies plan to knock some sense out of him. When Nelson awaits for Milhouse at the pivotal turn of the race, he hands Milhouse a cup of water before hitting him. Bart sees this, but runs ahead of the race to win first place. After Bart receives a blue ribbon for first place, Milhouse emerges from the bushes, conveniently with amnesia. Although Bart has several chances to disclose to Milhouse what happened during the race, Bart lets the opportunities slip, even at a town ceremony honoring his victory. However, when one of the bullies slingshots at Milhouse's forehead, the memories come rushing back, with Milhouse remembering how Bart just stood idly by as Milhouse suffered beating after beating. The outraged townspeople chase Bart from the ceremony. Bart runs to the retirement home, to seek help from Grandpa, without much luck. Meanwhile, elsewhere, Homer finds a man from the past to execute a spectacular fireworks display (set to \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\") for the town, but a fight breaks out between them. The fireworks go awry, yet Bart quickly thinks on his feet to get the town to believe that Milhouse is the modest hero. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"After two straight episodes suggesting the enduring potential of The Simpsons, 'The Yellow Badge Of Cowardge' is a return to late-career form right in time for the end of the show's 25th season.

It's not bad, it's not good‚Äîit's an acceptable half hour of television whose very adequacy damns it.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode four out of five stars, saying \\"The Simpsons 'The Yellow Badge of Cowardge' was a good Springfield episode. The fourth of July is a good time to bring out the town and put them in stupid outfits and working muskets. The episode was funny, it taught a lesson. Probably the wrong lesson, but why quibble?

After Riazanov was removed as director of the Marx-Engels Institute in February 1931 (and killed in a perfunctory trial in 1938) and Hitler rose to power in Germany in 1933, MEGA1 was silently discontinued.  Second MEGA  Only after Stalin's death was a second attempt undertaken in the 1960s. The cooperation between German and Soviet editors, new editorial guidelines and innovative concepts led to the publication of a first sample volume in 1972, followed by the first volume of the new, second MEGA (or MEGA2) in 1975. =Structure= MEGA contains material written by Marx between 1835 and his death in 1883, and by Engels between 1838 and his death in 1895. The project is divided into four general sections:  I. Abteilung (Werke, Artikel, Entw√ºrfe)  *All philosophical, economic, historical and political works, publications, articles and speeches of Marx and Engels. Well-known works of Marx and Engels, including The German Ideology (volume I/5), The Class Struggles in France 1848-1850 (volume I/10), The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon (volume I/11), Critique of the Gotha Program (volume I/25) and Anti-D√ºhring (volume I/27) are part of this section. It will comprise 32 volumes.Berlin- Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften: MEGA, Erste Abteilung (German).  II. Abteilung (Das Kapital und Vorarbeiten)  *This section contains Marx's major work, Capital: Critique of Political Economy (with all three volumes), and all the economic works and manuscripts related to it, beginning with the Grundrisse from 1857/58 (volume II/1). This section is so far the only completed one, it was finished with volume II/4.3 in 2012 and comprises 15 volumes in 23 books.Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften: MEGA, Zweite Abteilung (German).  III. Abteilung (Briefwechsel)  *The complete correspondence of Marx and Engels, both the exchange of letters between each other, as well as from Marx and Engels to third persons, whose letters to both authors are also completely printed in the edition. The section will comprise 35 volumes.Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften: MEGA, Dritte Abteilung (German).  IV. Abteilung (Exzerpte, Notizen, Marginalien)  *The previously largely unpublished excerpts, notes and marginalia of Marx and Engels. The section will comprise 32 volumes.Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften: MEGA, Vierte Abteilung (German). =Plan= Since 1990 MEGA is being published by the Internationale Marx-Engels-Stiftung (IMES) in Amsterdam. The IMES is an international network of the International Institute of Social History, the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (BBAW), the Karl-Marx-Haus (KMH) of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Trier, the Russian State Archive for Social/Political History (RGA) and the Russian Independent Institute for the Study of Social and National Problems (RNI), the latter two in Moscow. The main task of the IMES is to continue the publication of the Marx-Engels- Gesamtausgabe. In 2015 the (federal science conference) of the German federal states and the German national government decided to continue funding the publication of MEGA, albeit in a newly conceptualized form: All the letters in the third section of MEGA from 1866 to 1895 (from volume III/14 onwards) and large parts of the fourth section will only be published digitally in the future. All further volumes of the first and important volumes of the fourth section will, however, still be published in printed form.Press release of BBAW after GWK conference, October 30, 2015 (German).

The story follows the life of Shizuma Hasekura, who visits his childhood friend Makina Tomoe and her twin sister, Yukina Tomoe. Nursery Rhyme is set in future, and takes place in the same world of Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity. The gameplay in Nursery Rhyme follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game ranked at No. 2 in the national top 50 for best-selling PC games sold in Japan. Nursery Rhyme has made transitions into other media, such as a light novel and audio dramas. Gameplay Example of what average dialogue and narrative looks like in Nursery Rhyme. From left to right: Tita, Makina, Krile (and Azrael), Yuria, Rin and Yukina. Nursery Rhyme is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Shizuma Hasekura. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Shizuma is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Nursery Rhyme follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Throughout gameplay, there are scenes depicting Shizuma and a given heroine having sex. Plot =Setting= The game, taking place 500 years after the events of Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity, is set in a fictional Japan where the existence of magic has been recognized by society, and thus has been the subject of much research.

BacMap was originally developed in 2005 to address the challenges of viewing and navigating through the growing numbers of bacterial genomes that were being generated through large-scale sequencing efforts. Since it was first introduced, the number of bacterial genomes in BacMap has grown by more than 15X. Essentially BacMap functions as an on-line visual atlas of microbial genomes. All of the genome annotations in BacMap were generated through the BASys genome annotation system. BASys is a widely used microbial annotation infrastructure that performs comprehensive bionformatic analyses on raw (or labeled) bacterial genome sequence data. All of the genome (chromosome) maps in BacMap were constructed using the program known as CGView. CGView is a popular visualization program for generating interactive, web-compatible circular chromosome maps (Fig. 1). Each chromosome map in BacMap is extensively hyperlinked and each chromosome image can be interactively navigated, expanded and rotated using navigation buttons or hyperlinks. All identified genes in a BacMap chromosome map are colored according to coding directions and when sufficiently zoomed-in, gene labels are visible. Each gene label on a BacMap genome map is also hyperlinked to a 'gene card' (Fig. 2). The gene cards provide detailed information about the corresponding DNA and protein sequences. Each genome map in BacMap is searchable via BLAST and a gene name/synonym search. Because of the growing interest in metagenomics and large-scale bacterial genome analysis, BacMap was extensively updated in 2012. With the latest update, all of BacMap‚Äôs bacterial genome maps now have separate prophage genome maps as well as separate tRNA and rRNA maps. Each bacterial chromosome entry in BacMap now contains graphs and tables on a variety of gene and protein statistics. All of the bacterial species listed in BacMap now have bacterial 'biography' cards, with corresponding information on the microbe‚Äôs taxonomy, phenotypic traits, other descriptions and electron microscopy or other high-resolution images of the microbe itself. BacMap also has a number of updated data browsing and text searching tools that allow filtering, sorting and more facile display of the chromosome maps and their contents. Scope and Access All data in BacMap is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. It is freely accessible and available to anyone.

Called TumorGrafts, they are used to test a panel of chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapies and monoclonal antibodies to identify potential therapeutic options for cancer patients. The company was founded in 2007 by David Sidransky, M.D., a Johns Hopkins oncologist that was named by TIME as one of the top physicians and scientists in the United States in 2001.  TumorGrafts  Champions TumorGrafts maintain the microenvironment surrounding the tumor and have been shown to have high correlation to the patient‚Äôs tumor. Due to this close resemblance to the human tumor, TumorGrafts are highly predictive of treatment outcomes in patients. Studies have shown the mouse avatars predict clinical benefit in 80% of patients. Approximately 450 TumorGrafts have been established as of April 2014. TumorGrafts are also being used as a pre-clinical research tool to improve clinical drug development. Compared to traditional xenograft models, TumorGrafts, have a greater degree of accuracy in predicting clinical effectiveness of oncology drugs and thus can decrease clinical risk for drug developers. Champions has formed partnerships with multiple drug developers, including Teva and Pfizer. = The process = When a cancer patient undergoes surgery or biopsy, a living sample of the tumor is obtained and implanted into the mouse, creating a mouse avatar. Once the TumorGraft has successfully grown, the tumor is then propagated in a second generation of mice and tested against a panel of cancer drugs and drug combinations to help identify more accurately which treatment regimen is likely to be most effective in a specific patient. In this way, various drugs are tested on a live sample of the actual patient's tumor, rather than on the patient. This reduces the likelihood of treatment with ineffective drugs and their associated side effects, and it increases the likelihood of finding a treatment that will work against the patient's tumor. For patients whose tumors have also undergone molecular testing, such as next- generation sequencing, the selection of potential drugs is further guided by any and all applicable results. In the event the cancer progresses or recurs, Champions also banks, or stores, each successful TumorGraft for potential future patient use.

It originated in Central America and the Caribbean region and has spread to many of the world's tropical and subtropical regions, where it has become a major pest of agricultural crops. Description Adult spiralling whitefly are small, white, moth-like insects some 1/12-1/8 inch (2‚Äì3 mm) long. When they emerge from the pupal casing, the wings are transparent, but they soon become dusted with white fragments of wax. Each of the forewings bear a characteristic pair of black spots and the eyes in this species are a dark reddish brown. Distribution Aleurodicus dispersus is native to Central America and the Caribbean but is not regarded as a pest species in these areas. Since the middle of the 20th century it has spread to many parts of the tropics and subtropics. It was found and intercepted in the 1950s on imports into the United States by quarantine officials but later became established in Florida and in 1962 it had reached the Canary Islands. In the early 1980s it had appeared in Hawaii and other Pacific islands and had spread across tropical Asia by the middle of the decade. It had extended its range by the early 1990s to West Africa and India and to parts of the Indian Ocean. In 2009 it was still absent from the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, Hong Kong and most of Australia. It is most common at altitudes of less than 1000 feet (300 metres). Biology Aleurodicus dispersus is polyphagous, meaning that it is not reliant on a single host food plant but can feed on many different species of plant. Its host range includes over 100 species in 38 genera and 27 families. Cultivated crops and ornamentals affected by it include banana, coconut, citrus, avocado, breadfruit, mango, macadamia, guava, paw-paw, capsicum, lead tree, frangipani and rose. The life cycle starts with the deposition of a number of eggs that vary in colour from yellow to tan. These are laid, interspersed with bits of wax, in the form of a spiral on the surface of a leaf, usually on the underside. The eggs hatch after around ten days and pass through four immature stages before becoming adults. The first stage is known as a \\"crawler\\" and can move around while the other stages are sedentary. Once settled on the leaf surface, the nymphs start to exude tufts of white wax on the dorsal surface and the third stage nymph additionally produces glass-like waxy rods on its lateral surfaces, which may grow to a length of but usually break off before they reach this length. The first three stages feed by sucking sap from the plant whilst the fourth stage only does so initially, later becoming a puparium while undergoing some internal reorganisation of its tissues. The adults disperse by flying and females start laying eggs within about one day after emerging from their pupal cases. Unmated females produce exclusively male offspring whereas mated females produce young of both sexes. In the laboratory, the maximum lifespan was found to be 39 days, with 20 pairs of spiralling whitefly producing a total number of 1549 progeny over the course of 37 days. Crop damage The spiralling whitefly may cause damage to crops in several ways. The feeding of the adults, and particularly the sucking of sap by the first three nymphal stages, weakens the plant and causes leaves to fall prematurely, but is seldom sufficient to kill the plant. The copious amounts of honeydew secreted by the insects is appreciated by ants, wasps, bees and other insects and these may protect the whitefly from predation. Sooty mould often grows on the honeydew and may reduce the leaf area available for photosynthesis, disfigure the plant and even make it unmarketable. The nymphs produce a flocculent white waxy material and this may be dispersed by the wind and create \\"an unsightly nuisance\\". The spiralling whitefly can act as a vector and is one of only three species of whitefly able to transmit plant viruses. In some cases, these may cause the complete loss of the crop. Pest status Aleurodicus dispersus is considered to be a major agricultural pest. Despite the application of quarantine measures it has spread rapidly in the tropics and caused the loss of many millions of dollars through lower crop yields. Biological control by the introduction of predators such as ladybirds and parasitic wasps has proved quite effective. When a new area is invaded, at first the whitefly flourish unchecked, but in the course of time, the predators begin to exert some control and populations become more stable and start to reduce.

He has been called \\"the father of journalism\\" at San Jose State University. In 1934, he founded the Spartan Daily, the campus newspaper. In 1936, he founded the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, which has produced six Pulitzer Prize winners and thousands of journalists, and is one of the largest programs of its kind in the nation. The school renamed the building that houses the school \\"Dwight Bentel Hall\\" in 1982. Subsequently, the on campus advertising agency has been named Dwight, Bentel and Hall Communications. Bentel started as a reporter for the San Jose Mercury Herald, in the lineage of the San Jose Mercury News in 1928. At the time the paper was engaged in a Prohibition era campaign to eliminate Speakeasys from San Jose. His first day on the job, editor Merle Gray handed Bentel a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War-era Colt .45 revolver for his protection. He was thought to be the oldest living former member of the San Jose Mercury News staff. He also worked for the Associated Press and the San Francisco Call-Bulletin. Bentel began his collegiate education at San Jose State College also in 1928, before moving to Stanford University where he earned his B.A. in 1932 and masters in 1934. Shortly after that he was hired by San Jose State College President T. W. MacQuarrie. His short conversation was: That led to the eventual establishment of the School of Journalism. Working on his own, he established the volunteer run State College Times into a professionally run daily student newspaper. During World War II, Bentel left the department in the hands of Dolores Freitas Spurgeon, while he worked as a war news writer in New York City. He studied at Columbia University, eventually earning his doctoral degree. Meanwhile, Spurgeon kept the Spartan Daily alive by printing on a Mimeograph while newsprint was in short supply. Bentel returned to San Jose State University (formerly San Jose State College) in 1947 after earning his doctoral degree and continued to teach there until his retirement in 1974. The program grew to one of the largest in the country, including specialties in advertising, public relations, photojournalism and radio and television broadcasting. The department was one of the first to require internships for graduation. Bentel was a staunch defender of the First Amendment, reminding students from the first day: Bentel wrote a column for Editor and Publisher, plus wrote Stories of Santa Clara Valley, co-authored by Freitas Spurgeon and jointly authored The Encyclopedia of Photography; the Complete Photographer; the Comprehensive Guide and Reference for All Photographers.https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field- author;=Dr.%20Dwight%20Bentel&page;=1&rh;=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ADr.%20Dwight%20Bentel Bentel also had a lifelong passion for Death Valley, and spent many hours visiting, studying and researching the Valley and the people who inhabited it.

It was released on May 4, 2014 on Cherry Forever Records, packaged as a double A-side single with the song \\"Wedding Day\\". Featuring themes of public fame and notoriety, \\"You Know My Name\\" was written by Love, guitarist Micko Larkin and bassist Shawn Dailey. It was recorded alongside \\"Wedding Day\\" at Atrium Studios in Calabasas, California in early 2014 with producer Michael Beinhorn. The single was released on Love's own independent record label Cherry Forever, under license to Kobalt Label Services, and was supported by a well received eight-date tour of the United Kingdom. Critical reception to \\"You Know My Name\\" was largely positive and the single placed in the UK Independent Singles Chart upon its release. An accompanying music video, directed by Maximilla Lukacs, features Love performing \\"You Know My Name\\" as a character abandoned on her wedding day inspired by Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens 1861 novel Great Expectations. Origin and recording \\"You Know My Name\\" was written by Courtney Love, guitarist Micko Larkin and bassist Shawn Dailey. It was recorded in early 2014 at Atrium Studios in Calabasas, California and produced by Michael Beinhorn, who had previously produced Celebrity Skin (1998) and Nobody's Daughter (2010) by Love's former band Hole. The song features M√∂tley Cr√ºe member Tommy Lee on drums. In a television interview with BBC Breakfast, Love noted that the main themes of \\"You Know My Name\\" were fame and notoriety, referring to it as \\"a really simple, sweary, fast in-your-face song\\" about her public reputation. She described how she was inspired to write the song after repeated listens to The Rolling Stones 1968 song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", which left her \\"feeling quite like a rock villainess\\". Release and reception \\"You Know My Name\\" is Loves first solo release in a decade, since America's Sweetheart (2004) and its two supporting singles: \\"Mono\\" and \\"Hold On to Me\\". The song premiered on Steve Lamacqs radio programme on BBC Radio 6 Music on April 22, 2014 ahead of Love's British tour, and was later made available for stream on Love's official YouTube channel. \\"You Know My Name\\" was released as a double A-side single, also featuring the song \\"Wedding Day\\", on May 4, 2014 on Cherry Forever Records, under exclusive license to Kobalt Label Services.

On the opening night of the tour, Love debuted \\"You Know My Name\\" live and received warm reviews from various publications. \\"You Know My Name\\"/\\"Wedding Day\\" entered the UK Independent Singles Chart at number 34, as well as the Independent Singles Breakers Chart at number 8. Critical reception to \\"You Know My Name\\" was largely favorable. TIME writer Nolan Feeney described the song as \\"a thrilling punk workout\\" and noted that \\"just when the track seems to reach its peak, it ignites with a forceful hook: 'All this world is burning up / It's time that you retire.' Good thing she hasn't.\\" Writing for Stereogum, Michael Nelson referred to \\"You Know My Name\\" as \\"old- school, no-frills, no-fat punk rock with a huge, knockout hook on the chorus and a perfectly shredded vocal performance that only gets stronger as it gets more ragged\\", adding \\"this ‚Ä¶ is Courtney at her best\\". Chris Martins of Spin said that \\"it's the perfect mix of punk angst, metal shred, and melodic might\\" and concluded the song was \\"a bona fide ripper\\", while Rolling Stone surmised that the song \\"finds Love in full beast mode\\" and Entertainment Weekly drew comparisons between Love and Bob Dylan. Music video Marie Antoinette Love originally planned for the music video to \\"You Know My Name\\" to be directed by David LaChapelle. Love had a budget set aside for the video which subsequently \\"took a big hit\\" and she was unable to afford LaChapelle. After considering Steven Klein as a potential director, Love choose Maximilla Lukacs to direct the video. Lukacs shot directed the music video for \\"You Know My Name\\" in April 2014. Love shared updates from the video shoot on various social media accounts, including Instagram where she uploaded teaser clips describing the themes of the video. Love stated that her intention was to \\"look like an old Victorian doll crossed with a Dickensian character called Miss Havisham, who got abandoned on her wedding day at the altar and lived to be a hundred\\". The character portrayed by Love is represented by Lukacs' recurring motif of \\"hyper-feminine\\" and \\"surreal\\" imagery, which Love \\"literally destroys\\". Love stated that she \\"thought it would be really for [Lukacs]\\" to derive from her standard directing style as \\"[she] has never done really hard-core before\\".

He was the lord of Neum, the Popovo field, and the Lower Neretva region. He fell in battle during the Bosnian-Ragusan War (1403). Life The Nikoliƒá family held possessions in the Popovo field. The family's eponymous founder, Nikola, descended from ≈æupan Bogdan, who in turn descended from Stefan Nemanja's brother, knez Miroslav of Hum (r. ca. 1166‚Äì1190). Nikola had two sons, Bogi≈°a and Vladislav, the latter being Vukosav's father. Vladislav had married Stanislava, the daughter or sister of Stephen II Kotromaniƒá (r. 1322‚Äì1353), in 1344. Vukosav is mentioned since 1395 at the royal court. He was the lord of Neum, the Popovo field and the Lower Neretva region. King Dabi≈°a of Bosnia (r. 1391‚Äì1395) died in September 1395. He had designated King Sigismund of Hungary, the husband of his cousin, Queen Mary, as his successor. Mary, however, had predeceased Dabi≈°a, dying in May the same year. The Bosnian nobility refused to recognize Sigismund as king, as his right had rested in his status as Mary's husband. Instead, the nobility installed Jelena Gruba, his widow, and member of the Nikoliƒá family, as the successor to her husband.Fine 1994, p. 458‚Äì On November 20, 1395, the Republic of Ragusa wrote a letter that secured Ragusan citizenship for Vukosav and his successors. He and his brothers were among many of the Bosnian nobility who had Ragusan citizenship. In 1396, when John Kanizsai, the archbishop of Esztergom, fell ill during a trip to Ragusa (Dubrovnik) as King Sigismund's envoy, Vukosav sent a load of expensive wine to him from the Popovo field. In 1398, Queen Jelena was replaced with King Ostoja (r. 1353‚Äì77), on an unclear basis (according to Fine 1994, due to her brothers gaining too much wealth and influence, to the dismay of the nobility). The unrest in Bosnia and the change of throne was not to the benefit of the Nikoliƒá family, which had stood on the side of Jelena Gruba against Stephen Ostoja. Jelena Gruba had support in the Nikoliƒá family, the Radivojeviƒá family, and Tvrtko II. When the new king Stephen Ostoja began taking the throne, the pressed Nikoliƒá family sought refuge on territory of the Republic of Ragusa. In 1398, Vukosav and Radiƒç Sankoviƒá opposed the sale of the Dubrovnik coastland between the Republic of Ragusa and Ostoja; the Ragusans had through diplomacy decided that villages of Trnovica and Lisac be handed over to them - Vukosav and Radiƒç refused. As a nobleman in the service of Sandalj Hraniƒá, Vukosav fell in battle during the Bosnian-Ragusan War (1403), while he supported Ostoja alongside Sandalj Hraniƒá and Radiƒç Sankoviƒá. He fell at the coast of Slano, at the Brgat hill near Dubrovnik, while fighting a contingent from Ston. The Ragusans set fire to ≈†umet and ≈Ωrnovnica forcing the Bosnian army to retreat. The same year in autumn, the Ragusan senate permitted Vukosav's son, knez Grgur, to send two of his men to Ston to place a gravestone on the grave of his father (\\"de faciendo gratiam Gregorio, filio Vocosavi Nikolich, quod possit miter Stagnum duos ex hominibus ad ponendum super corpus patris sui plancham lapideam\\").

Life and career After obtaining his GCE A Level at St. Bedes Secondary School in Kom, Besong was admitted to the University of Calabar where he published his maiden collection of poems titled Polyphemous Detainee and Other Skulls in 1980 before he graduated. While at the university, Bate Besong and Ba'bila Mutia founded Oracle, a journal of poetry edited by students. Realising that his emerging reputation as a budding writer was giving him recognision as a Nigerian and compromising his Cameroonian identity, Besong returned to Cameroon after completing his MA. He was a lecturer at the University of Buea, where he taught from 1999 right up to his death in 2007. In 1992, shortly after his play Beasts of No Nation was staged, Besong was kidnapped and tortured by state security agents who took him to an unknown location from where he was later released when news of his kidnapping became public.Babila Mutia, Summit Magazine, N0 20,June 2012 In 1992 he won the Association of Nigerian Authors' Prize for Requiem for the Last Kaiser.Joyce B.

Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. 291 (2014), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court concerning affirmative action and race- and sex-based discrimination in public university admissions. In a 6-2 decision, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause does not prevent states from enacting bans on affirmative action in education. The case arose after Michigan voters approved the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which amended the state constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment and public education. In a plurality opinion joined by two other justices, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that the ban on affirmative action was constitutional. Kennedy wrote that \\"[t]here is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters.\\" Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer concurred in the result but filed or joined separate opinions. In her dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the voters of Michigan had \\"changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.\\" Background In 1961, President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order establishing the concept of affirmative action and mandating that federally financed projects ensure that their hiring and employment practices are free of racial bias. With the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin was prohibited. In the first case involving affirmative action in higher education, the Supreme Court ruled in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) that the UC Davis medical school admissions program violated the Fourteenth Amendment with the institution of quotas for underrepresented minorities. It did not, however, eliminate race as a factor in university admissions, calling diversity a \\"compelling interest.\\" The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Hopwood v. Texas (5th Cir.1996) that the University of Texas School of Law could not use race as a factor in admissions. This was the first successful legal challenge to racial preferences since Bakke. Two cases in 2003 involving the University of Michigan found that the university's policy of granting extra points to minorities for undergraduate admissions was unconstitutional (Gratz v. Bollinger) but that a program which gave holistic consideration for being a certain racial minority, though not an automatic boost, in admissions to the law school was constitutional (Grutter v. Bollinger). Michigan voters approved Proposal 2 in 2006 which amended the state's constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment, public education or public contracting purposes, except for actions mandated by federal law or that are necessary in order for an institution to receive federal funding.Mich. Const., Art. I, sec. 26 The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in 2012 that the ban was unconstitutional.Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v. Regents of the University of Michigan, et al. (6th Cir. 2012) Supreme Court The Court heard oral argument on October 15, 2013. John J. Bursch, then the Michigan Solicitor General, argued for the petitioner, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. Mark D. Rosenbaum argued for the Cantrell respondents, and Shanta Driver argued for the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. =Opinion and concurrences= On April 22, 2014, the Court ruled for the petitioner that the ban on affirmative action in the Michigan Constitution is constitutional. Justice Kennedy, writing the plurality opinion, wrote that \\"[t]here is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters.\\" Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito joined in the plurality. Chief Justice Roberts also filed a concurring opinion, arguing that the dissent contains a paradox: the governing board banning affirmative action is an exercise of policymaking authority, but others who reach that conclusion (presumed to mean the supporters of Proposal 2) do not take race seriously. He continues that racial preferences may actually do more harm than good, as they reinforce doubt about whether or not minorities belong. Justice Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justice Thomas. He examines what he calls a \\"frighteningly bizarre question\\": Whether the Equal Protection Clause forbids what its text requires. He answers this by quoting his concurrence/dissent in Grutter: that \\"the Constitution [forbids] government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.\\" He asserts that the people of Michigan adopted that understanding of the clause as their fundamental law, and that by adopting it, \\"they did not simultaneously offend it.\\"Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U.S. ___ (2014) Justice Breyer filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that the case has nothing to do with reordering the political process, nor moving decision-making power from one level to another, but rather that university boards delegated admissions-related authority to unelected faculty and administration. He further argues that the same principle which supports the right of the people or their representatives to adopt affirmative action policies for the sake of inclusion also gives them the right to vote not to do so, as Michigan did. =Dissent= Justice Sotomayor filed a dissent, joined by Justice Ginsburg, outlining what she called the nation's \\"long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process.\\" She charges that \\"[a] majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.\\" Sotomayor contended that those opposed to affirmative action policies could have either lobbied the boards of the state's universities to change their policies or, through the electoral process, changed the membership of the boards. She invokes the political-process doctrine, recognized in Hunter v. Erickson (1969) and Washington v. Seattle School District (1982), whereby \\"[w]hen the majority reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority, that alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.\\" Sotomayor had previously credited her own admission to college to affirmative action, stating \\"I am the perfect affirmative action baby,\\" and that without affirmative action \\"it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted.\\" References External links * 2014 in United States case law United States affirmative action case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court United States equal protection case law University and college admissions Legal history of Michigan ","title":"Schuette v.

Myanmar and Pakistan maintain diplomatic and trade relations. History The bilateral relations were established on 14 August 1947 between Burma and Pakistan, which they shared border with each other when East Pakistan existed. Since 1988 both have embassies in each other's capitals. A historic fact that after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Ambassador of Myanmar, U Pe Khin, was the first ever envoy to present his credentials to Governor-General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah.http://www.app.com.pk/pakistan-for-boosting- bilateral-economic-ties-with-myanmar-president/ = Early separatist insurgency = In May 1946, Muslim leaders from Arakan, Burma (present-day Rakhine State, Myanmar) met with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and asked for the formal annexation of two townships in the Mayu region, Buthidaung and Maungdaw, by East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Two months later, the North Arakan Muslim League was founded in Akyab (present-day Sittwe, capital of Rakhine State), which also asked Jinnah to annex the region. Jinnah refused, saying he could not interfere with Burma's internal matters. After Jinnah's refusal, proposals were made by Muslims in Arakan to the newly formed post-independence government of Burma, asking for the concession of the two townships to Pakistan. The proposals were rejected by the Burmese parliament.Hugh Tinker, The Union of Burma: A Study of the First Year of Independence, (London, New York, and Toronto: Oxford University Press) 1957, p. 357. Local mujahideen were subsequently formed against the Burmese government, and began targeting government soldiers stationed in the area. Led by Mir Kassem, the newly formed mujahideen movement began gaining territory, driving out local Rakhine communities from their villages, some of whom fled to East Pakistan. In November 1948, martial law was declared in the region, and the 5th Battalion of the Burma Rifles and the 2nd Chin Battalion were sent to liberate the area. By June 1949, the Burmese government's control over the region was reduced to the city of Akyab, whilst the mujahideen had possession of nearly all of northern Arakan. After several months of fighting, Burmese forces were able to push the mujahideen back into the jungles of the Mayu region, near the country's border with East Pakistan. In 1950, the Pakistani government warned its counterparts in Burma about their treatment of Muslims in Arakan. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu immediately sent a Muslim diplomat, Pe Khin, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding, so that Pakistan would cease sending aid to the mujahideen. In 1954, Kassem was arrested by Pakistani authorities, and many of his followers surrendered to the government.U Nu, U Nu: Saturday's Son, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press) 1975, p. 272. The post-independence government accused the mujahideen of encouraging the illegal immigration of thousands of Bengalis from East Pakistan into Arakan during their rule of the area, a claim that has been highly disputed over the decades, as it brings into question the legitimacy of the Rohingya as an ethnic group of Myanmar. Diplomatic Relations Pakistan has a diplomatic mission in Yangon, while Myanmar maintains a diplomatic office in Islamabad. Pakistan International Airlines has flown to Yangon in the past and still operates Hajj charter flights on behalf of the Burmese government. Burma provided a route for the evacuation of the Dacca-based Pakistani Army Aviation Squadron after the Indian takeover. On 26 July 2012, a threat was made by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan that they would attack Myanmar unless Pakistan severed relations with the Burmese government including closing the Myanmar embassy in Islamabad. This was in response to what they perceived to be crimes against the Rohingya people. Pakistan has a diplomatic mission in Yangon while Myanmar maintains an embassy in Islamabad. Economic Relations During the 1950-60s, trade between Myanmar (then Burma) and Pakistan was the largest as compared to other Southeast Asian countries. However, over the years, trade between Myanmar and Pakistan deteriorated. In 1995, bilateral trade was US$34 million, it declined to US$10 million in 1999. Later, in 2000, trade improved to US$24 million. The present trade volume between Myanmar and Pakistan is US$70 million far less than their latent potentials. Myanmar's exports to Pakistan are fruits, vegetable products, wood, seafood, jute and other textile fibers, medicinal plants are being imported from Myanmar. Whereas Pakistan's exports to Myanmar include Military technology, medicament mixtures, cement, medicinal plants, leather, cotton fabrics, electro-medical apparatus. In January 2012, former President Asif Ali Zardari visited Myanmar. The visit focused to enhance bilateral trade between the two countries. Pakistani side proposed for a Preferential Trading Area (PTA) along with a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Establishment of a joint ministerial commission as well as cooperation in the oil and gas sector was also proposed.http://www.ipripak.org/pakistan-myanmar-trade-ties-likely-prospects/ A Bilateral Agreement in Science and Technology exists between the two states.

He served as FAS vice-chairman for two years before he was appointed chairman on 31 March 1976, and was a vice- president of the Asian Football Confederation. He stepped down as FAS chairman in 1982. He was a criminal lawyer by trade. Early life Ganesan was born in Tank Road, Singapore to Tamil parents from Madurai, the youngest of five children. Abandoned by their father, the children were brought up by their mother. After the war, he studied at Victoria School and later at Anglo- Chinese School. He later did his bar exams at Inner Temple, London and received his LLB at the University Of London. His mother died whilst he was taking his final exams in London. Upon his return to Singapore he became a successful criminal litigator, deputy public prosecutor and district judge. He was also an avid reader and supporter of the arts in Singapore and contributed by teaching Literature classes later in life at the National University of Singapore. The arts definitely was a family trait as his niece, Madhavi Krishnan is famed classical Bharatanatyam dancer and ex-Indian film actress and the first female recipient of Singapore's Cultural Medallion in 1979. FAS Ganesan was responsible for changing the Malaysia Cup venue from the Jalan Besar Stadium to the 55,000 capacity National Stadium. He also revamped the local leagues and their 118 teams into the 30-team National Football League. Ganesan was also a staunch supporter of coach Choo Seng Quee, whom he brought in as national coach after he became the chairman of the FAS. Choo subsequently led Singapore to a Malaysia Cup title in 1977, twelve years after the team last won the competition. Ganesan fought for the Pre-World Cup tournament to be held in Singapore's National Stadium in 1977. Singapore finished second in the group but lost to Hong Kong in the play-off final. The Lion City Cup was founded by Ganesan in 1977 as the first Under-16 tournament in the world. The tournament would serve as inspiration for FIFA to introduce the FIFA U-16 World Championship in 1985.

Baker and Bohdan Siryk and published by Western Psychological Services in 1987 (manual published 1989). The questionnaire is proprietary and copies of the questionnaire as well as the manual can be purchased from the WPS website. History In a 1984 paper, Baker and Siryk described the results of a 52-item self-report inventory that used a Likert scale. They had administered this inventory to 734 students, and their paper discussed the reliability and validity of the data thus obtained. This would later grow into the Student Adaptation to Colleges Questionnaire. Description of the questionnaire The questionnaire is a 67-item self- report inventory that assesses overall adjustment to college, as well as adjustment in four specific areas: * Academic adjustment * Personal-emotional adjustment * Social adjustment * Attachment (to the institution) The authors claim that if the questionnaire is used at the time people enter college, it can be used for the early detection of potential adjustment problems and can increase the retention of students who might otherwise drop out. Reception =Academic research= There is some academic research that relies on the SACQ and judges its usefulness. A 1992 paper by Krotseng used discriminant analysis to determine \\"(1) the extent to which the SACQ accurately predicts student departure for a private, comprehensive university; (2) SACQ items distinguishing nonpersisters; (3) use with an incoming class; and (4) evidence linking the SACQ with intervention strategies.\\" Another 1992 paper by Dahmus, Bernardin, and Bernardin discussed the SACQ's potential. A 1994 study by Gerdes and Mallinckrodt used SACQ data to measure the emotional, social, and academic adjustment of college students. A 2002 paper by Beyers and Goossens from the Catholic University of Leuven considered the applicability of the SACQ to Europe and concluded: \\"With some reservations regarding the Academic Adjustment subscale, then, the SACQ seems to be a useful tool for research on university life among college students in Europe.\\" The abstract of a 2012 meta-analysis by Cred√© and Niehorster (k = 237, N = 44,668) reads: \\"The review, based on studies using the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire, is organized around three primary themes: (1) the structure of students‚Äô adjustment to college, (2) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with possible antecedents and correlates, and (3) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with college grades and college retention. Meta-analytic results indicate that adjustment to college is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of college retention. Adjustment to college is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students‚Äô relationships with their parents. Weaker relationships are evident with demographic variables, prior achievement, coping approaches, and variables that reflect students‚Äô psychological independence from their parents. Theoretical and practical implications for the study of students‚Äô adjustment to college, academic performance, and retention are discussed.\\" References External links * Psychological testing Surveys University and college admissions ","title":"Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire"},{"id":"42556963","title":"Athletics at the 1999 All-Africa Games ‚Äì Women's discus throw"},{"id":"42556972","text":"Ferrocarril Econ√≥mico Correntino was the informal name for some former narrow gauge State-owned railway lines in Corrientes Province of Argentina that used a gauge of .

The Law specified a 600mm- narrow gauge and the use of steam locomotives for the railway. Law also granted Bolla's company the lands where the railway would be built, also exempting company from paying duties for a period of 30 years.

Because of that, the Government suspended the construction by decree on July 17, 1896. Works were finally resumed on September 14, giving also new concessions to the company.

Taxonomy Deraniyagala's beaked whale was once synonymous with the Ginkgo-toothed beaked whale (Mesoplodon ginkgodens), until several studies confirmed that M. hotaula was genetically different from M. ginkgodens. Like several other species of beaked whales, Deraniyagala's beaked whale is known only from stranded individuals, in this case, seven. The first stranding occurred in Sri Lanka, but was falsely identified as Ginkgo-toothed beaked whale by Moore and Gilmore, 1965. The two species were split due to DNA analysis by various organisations in the 2000s, with the seven individuals' control region, cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase, and various introns taken for genetic analysis. It was found that genetic variance (DŒ±) of the cytochrome b between Deraniyagala's whale and the Ginkgo-toothed beaked whale was 8.2% ¬± 1.79%, whereas genetic variance range between 5.5% to 16.6% in other Mesoplodon species (the smaller the percentage, the lesser the genetic differences between the two species). It was first recognised by Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1963 and was subsequently named after him. Distribution Deraniyagala's beaked whale is known from only seven individuals that have stranded themselves on beaches of various islands in the Indian and South Pacific Oceans: Seychelles, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Gilbert Islands, Kiribati and Line Islands. It is thought that, like Cuvier's beaked whale, they live in insular populations (isolated communities).

There is a main road that runs northeast-southwest from Murehwa District with connections to Harare through the district to Mudzi District and thereafter to Mozambique. There are no permanent streams in the district and most water is from boreholes. Some stream beds are dammed and catch seasonal run-off. Economy The primary occupation is agriculture, with the majority being subsistence farmers. In 1998, about 12% of the land in the district was small commercial farms. The primary crop is maize, followed by ground nuts (peanuts), and table vegetables. Maize, ground nuts, sunflowers (for seed), sorghum, and millet are grown commercially.

In addition to the different available lengths, the buses are sold with a variety of prime movers, ranging from conventional diesel and CNG combustion engines to diesel-electric hybrid, hydrogen fuel cell, and battery electric. Design For example, a New Flyer XE40 is a 40' (nominal) rigid Xcelsior with battery-electric power. =XE Xcelsior CHARGE= The first battery- electric Xcelsior buses were a powertrain option within the regular Xcelsior line; development was announced in 2011, a prototype was shown in 2012, and regular production began in 2014. The original battery-electric Xcelsior bus, offered as an XE40, used a permanent magnet traction motor built by Siemens. In October 2017, the Xcelsior CHARGE sub-line was introduced including a nice ABS and TCS for transmissions. An XE40 battery-electric bus operated by TriMet in Portland, Oregon, connected to an overhead recharging station (2019) The Xcelsior CHARGE variant (XEnn) uses the Siemens ELFA2 electric drive system with different options for battery capacity, depending on the charging speed and range required. The traction motor used has an output of either and . Batteries are supplied by XALT Energy or A123 Systems (XE60 long-range models and XHEnn fuel cell models). On-route rapid charging is provided through an overhead pantograph designed to be interoperable with the SAE J3105 standard supplying 300‚Äì450 kW. Shop or depot charging may be performed using SAE J3068 and J1772 connectors supplying up to 150 kW. At Altoona, the as-tested empty weight of an XE40 was measured at with a capacity of 76 (38 seated passengers + 37 standing passengers + 1 driver) for a total GVW of . It was equipped with 4 XALT Xsyst 7 (7 kWh) batteries and a SPHEROS fuel-fired heater. When accelerating from a constant speed, the bus emitted an average maximum noise level of 66.1 dB(A), considerably lower than the average maximum noise level of 70.4 dB(A) measured from a conventionally-powered XD40. XE60 The articulated XE60 adds a second driven axle, using the ZF AxTrax AVE on the middle axle. The AxTrax AVE (formerly known as the AVE 130) uses two electric motors (one per wheel), each with a maximum continuous/peak output of and maximum continuous/peak torque of . Each motor is an asynchronous three-phase AC motor operating on 650 VDC with an input current of 250 (continuous) to 340 (peak) amps, using a single-speed reduction gear ratio of 22.66:1. The complete axle assembly weighs The as-tested empty weight of an XE60 was with a capacity of 120 (50 seated passengers + 69 standing passengers + 1 driver) for a total GVW of . Compared to the diesel-powered equivalent XD60, the XE60 is heavier (XD60 GVW is ) and holds slightly fewer people (XD60 capacity is 123 people: 49 seated, 73 standing, 1 driver). Depending on the driving route/style, the XE60 tested at Altoona had a predicted range of . =XHE fuel cell bus= The CHARGE model can be equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell (XHEnn), which acts as an on-board charger to extend range. Earlier New Flyer fuel cell buses were based on the preceding Low Floor chassis, designated H40LFR, and integrated by an outside vendor. In 2016, New Flyer received an order for 25 XHE40 buses under the California Air Resources Board Air Quality Improvement Program (AQIP). The XHE40 uses a MAN SE model 1350 rear axle with a traction motor from Siemens; like the XE60, the XHE60 also uses a MAN 1350 rear axle as a pusher, but adds a ZF AxTrax AVE middle axle as a puller for traction-challenged conditions. An XHE60 tested at Altoona weighed empty; with a total capacity of 132 (1 driver, 50 seated, 81 standing), the estimated GVW was . The fuel cell was a Ballard HD85 with an 85 kW output. Deployment MTA New York City Transit. The Xcelsior was introduced at the 2008 APTA Expo held in San Diego. New Flyer reduced weight by approximately 10% compared to its preceding Low Floor series, in the interest of fuel economy. Brampton Transit, serving Brampton, Ontario, was the first agency to order the Xcelsior. The first trolleybus version of the Xcelsior was an XT40 built in 2014 for the Seattle trolleybus system, operated by King County Metro, the first unit of an order placed in 2013. King County Metro also purchased the XT60 (articulated trolleybus), and both XT40s and XT60s were subsequently purchased by the San Francisco Municipal Railway, for the San Francisco trolleybus system. WMATA #1001, New Flyer XE40 (2017) The first Xcelsior battery electric buses (XE40) were built in 2014 and delivered to the Chicago Transit Authority and Winnipeg Transit. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was the lead agency for the XE60, ordered in January 2019 and placed into service on July 31, 2019. Development of the electric fuel cell buses is centered in California, with AC Transit serving as the lead agency for one XHE60, and SunLine Transit Agency, AC Transit, and Orange County Transportation Authority testing several variants of XHE40.

Recently renovated the impressive building is now an Exclusive Wedding hire venue. The present house stood close to the site of a large 17th-century large timber-framed house. Garthmyl Hall was completely rebuilt in 1859 by the architect James K Colling for Major-General William George Gold. Setting Garthmyl Hall is to the south of Berriew, overlooking the Severn valley and set back from the A 483 Welshpool to Newtown Road. It is immediately south-west of the junction with the B 4385 and set in a small park, which covers about 15 acres. The house is surrounded by woodland on ground which slopes to the south. The parkland is registered as Grade II in the Cadw Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales where it is described as a \\"Good example of a classical gentry house with well preserved grounds developed in the mid nineteenth century in a fine setting. The garden contains a magnificent mature cedar of Lebanon.\\" To the north of the house is a large walled garden and to the east are stable buildings. History The original house, was known as Garthmyl House and was sited to the east of the present house and a print (probably copied from a drawing) shows a large timbered framed mansionIllustration of 'Garthmill House', (1798), The Gentleman's Magazine (1800), National Library of Wales, Pl. 4778. The house had been the ancestral home of the Jones family.Humphreys, C.,The pedigree of Jones of Garthmyl, The Montgomeryshire Collections, (1891), vol. 25, p. 299. This house is likely to have been built by John Reynolds (a cousin to the Jones Family), who died in 1672. Following a fire in the mid-eighteenth century, part of the house remained until at least 1825 when it was recorded on an estate map. The old house had been demolished by the time of the subsequent tithe map of 1840 and a new house may have been built on the site of the present Garthmyl HallEstate and Tithe maps in the National Library of Wales In 1859 Garthmyl was purchased by John Naylor of Leighton Hall for his sister Elizabeth Mary, who had married William George Gold (1800‚Äì83) in 1832. At the time of their marriage Gold had been a captain in the 59th Regiment of Foot (later the Shropshire Regiment) and by 1859 had risen to become a major- general. In 1864 he was to become the Sheriff of Montgomeryshire. Many sources say that an earlier house was re-modelled for their occupationHaslam, R., The Buildings of Powys, (1979), p. 105 but there does not appear to be any surviving evidence for this and the present Garthmyl Hall must represent a completely new building.The evidence for this statement is provided by the photographs accompanying this article Following the death of Major General Gold's widow, the ownership of Garthmyl Hall passed to John Naylor, who in 1884 describes himself as of Leighton and Garthmyl Halls.E. Walford,The County-Families of Great Britain, Chatto and Windus, 1884. It was then purchased by Mrs Harriet Humphreys, and it continued in the ownership of the Humphrys and Churchill family until 1985. The hall was bought in October 2015 by the Pugh family and went under extensive restoration throughout to transform it into an exclusive hire wedding venue. The hall is also available for hire for other events and for country house breaks. The hall was officially opened in April 2016. Architectural description The architect for Garthmyl Hall was James K. Colling,Haslam R and Scourfield R, ‚ÄúPowys:Buildings of Wales‚Äù, 2nd edition, Yale University Press well known for his pattern books for Victorian architectural designs, but little known for his architectural work. He was responsible for the Albany Building in Liverpool.Richard Pollard, Lancashire: Liverpool & the South-West (2006) This was speculative venture for John Naylor's brother Richard. Garthmyl Hall. Terracotta frieze and consoles below eves He also built the Castellated Gothic Ashwicke Hall in Gloucestershire for the Liverpool attorney John Orred 1857‚Äì60David Verey, rev. Alan Brooks: Gloucestershire 1: The Cotswolds (1999), pg 472, . Colling was given a free hand by the wealthy John Naylor when building Garthmyl Hall, as seen by the use of lavish gilding and plasterwork for ceiling decoration, and for the ornamental terracotta on the exterior. This was an opportunity for him to put into practice some of the designs illustrated in his books. Garthmyl Hall with the Gold/Naylor Coat of Arms in terracotta set in the pediment Garthmyl Hall is two-storey, square, red brick house, five bays wide and six bays deep. It is executed in a sophisticated classical style with some Italianate and Grecian elements creeping in. Stone and terracotta dressings are used to ornament the south-east front. Colling is likely to have patronised John Marriott Blashfield's Stamford Terracotta Company for the supply of the terracotta mouldings.M Stratton The Terracotta Revival: Building Innovation and the Industrial City in Britain and Northern America Gollancz, London 1993, 144‚Äì47 The centre bay projects slightly, emphasised on the ground floor with a four columned Tuscan porch, and above by a pediment which is set with a terracotta coat of arms of the Gold and Naylor families with the motto Trust in God. The deep undercutting of the foliage and roses surrounding the coat of arms is typical of Blashfield's work \\"Stratton\\", 157. Below the eaves runs a terracotta scroll frieze that is very similar to the frieze used by Colling on the Albany building. The hipped slate roof is set with large brick axial chimney stacks with stone caps.The design of these chimneys is almost identical to that in Blashfield trade catalogue of 1868 illustrating Terra Cotta Chimney Shafts, Chimney PotsGarthmyl Hall Stable block The brick Stable block, which has an entrance range with a central pediment over a lunette and surmounted by a cupola, is likely to be earlier than the main house. The interior of the house is impressive with the room inside to the right of the entrance with a decorative, almost Tudoresque, painted ceiling and a marble fireplace. The hall has an Ionic screen between the hall and the rising staircase around a stairwell. The staircase has attractive iron lattice-work supports for the rail. Two large rooms on the left of the entrance have elaborately moulded and gilt decorated ceilings. File:Garthmyl Hall 16.JPG|Garthmyl Hall File:Garthmyl Hall 02.JPG|Garthmyl Hall.

For many years it has been known that protein chemical shifts are sensitive to protein secondary structure, which in turn, is sensitive to backbone torsion angles. torsion angles are internal coordinates that can be used to describe the conformation of a polypeptide chain. They can also be used as constraints to help determine or refine protein structures via NMR spectroscopy. In proteins there are four major torsion angles of interest: phi, psi, omega and chi-1. Traditionally protein NMR spectroscopists have used vicinal J-coupling information and the Karplus relation to determine approximate backbone torsion angle constraints for phi and chi-1 angles. However, several studies in the early 1990s pointed out the strong relationship between 1H and 13C chemical shifts and torsion angles, especially with backbone phi and psi angles. Later a number of other papers pointed out additional chemical shift relationships with chi-1 and even omega angles. PREDITOR was designed to exploit these experimental observations and to help NMR spectroscopists easily predict protein torsion angles from chemical shift assignments. Specifically, PREDITOR accepts protein sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates torsion angle predictions for phi, psi, omega and chi-1 angles. The algorithm that PREDITOR uses combines sequence alignment, chemical shift alignment and a number of related chemical shift analysis techniques to predict torsion angles. PREDITOR is unusually fast (<40 s per protein) and exhibits a very high level of accuracy. In a series of tests 88% of PREDITOR‚Äôs phi/psi predictions were within 30 degrees of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions (3-state predictions) were correct and 99.97% of PREDITOR‚Äôs predicted omega angles were correct. PREDITOR also estimates the torsion angle errors so that its torsion angle constraints can be used with standard protein structure refinement software, such as CYANA, CNS, XPLOR and AMBER. PREDITOR also supports automated protein chemical shift re-referencing and the prediction of proline cis/trans states. PREDITOR is not the only torsion angle prediction software available. Several other computer programs including TALOS, TALOS+ and DANGLE have also been developed to predict backbone torsion angles from protein chemical shifts. These stand-alone programs exhibit similar prediction performance to PREDITOR but are substantially slower.

The aft design was considered ugly by passenger ship purists. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she was put into military service and transferred to the Soviet Union under terms of Lend-Lease. They renamed her Balkhash. She was used to transfer Estonian prisoners to the Gulag during World War II and later transferred to the Far East Company. She remained in service through at least 1967, and her hull was used for a while afterward as a service vessel for repairing navigation systems. She was reportedly scrapped in 1975, though she may have been used for many years more.  Pacific service  The ship was built by Newport News Shipbuilding and launched on November 1, 1913. She arrived in Honolulu on March 24, 1914 on her maiden voyage. Her Bridge Deck held the officer's quarters, the Promenade Deck 10 deluxe passenger cabins, and the Main Deck 20 passenger cabins. One-way fares in 1920 were $350‚Äì$500 for a cabin on the Promenade Deck with a private bathroom, $90 to $100.00 for a cabin on the Promenade Deck without a private bathroom, and $90 for a cabin on the Main Deck. She carried about 90 passengers and seven officers on week- long trips from Pier 32 in San Francisco to Honolulu, Hawaii, and thence to Kahului, Maui, before returning to Honolulu. The Manoa served this route from 1913 to 1942. Passengers could transfer to other Matson ships for passage to the South Pacific Islands.

Transfer to Soviet Union  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she, along with the other Matson passenger ships Lurline, Matsonia, Mariposa and Monterey, and 33 Matson freighters, were pressed into military service by the U.S. Maritime Commission. The U.S. transferred the Manoa to the Soviet Union in 1943 as part of the Lend-Lease Program. They rechristened her as Balkhash (Soviet registration M-11744), replacing a ship of the same name that had been sunk by the German air force during the evacuation of Tallinn, Estonia. She was used at least twice by the Soviets during World War II to transport Estonian prisoners to the Gulag. The ship was modernized in 1956 in Chinese shipyards and restored to her original configuration carrying both cargo and passengers. She was transferred on June 22, 1964 to the Far Eastern Shipping Company, and two years later on December 13, 1966, she was decommissioned. She was used for the next few years as a floating base to repair navigation equipment for the Vladivostok merchant fleet. The ship's name was removed from the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping in 1967, and was reported to have been scrapped in Vladivostock in 1975, although other reports state her hull may have been used through 1985 and perhaps later.

He played as an outside right. Life and career Sinclair was born in Winchburgh, West Lothian. As a youngster, he was on the books of Heart of Midlothian, but never played in competitive first- team football for the club. He went on to play for junior club Musselburgh Athletic before joining First Division club Falkirk in January 1938. He made what the Scotsman described as \\"quite a promising debut\\" in the Scottish Cup defeat of St Mirren on 12 February, and in the absence of several regular players through injury, made his Scottish First Division debut the following week, in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Motherwell.

National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth Hugh Hughes (1790?‚Äì1863) was a Welsh painter, engraver and writer. Life Born at Pwllygwichiad, near Llandudno, the son of Thomas Hughes, by Jane, his wife, he was baptised at Llandudno, according to the parish register, on 20 February 1790. He lost his parents in childhood and was educated by his maternal grandfather, Hugh Williams of Meddiant Farm, in Llansantffraid Glan Conwy, Denbighshire. Hughes was apprenticed to an engraver in Liverpool; from there he moved to London as an improver, and took lessons in oil painting. From 1819 to 1822 Hughes worked at Meddiant Farm on The Beauties of Cambria, his best-known work; he returned to London after 1823. A radical in religion and politics, he signed a petition in favour of passing the Catholic Emancipation Bill in about 1828. The London leaders of the Welsh Calvinistic body, to which he belonged, then expelled him from their communion. Hughes denounced this act of intolerance in pamphlets and letters to Seren Gomer (1828‚Äì1830). At a meeting of delegates of the Calvinistic Methodists held at Bala in 1831, a resolution was passed deprecating interference with the exercise of political rights. Hughes was not, however, reinstated as member of the denomination. After a time Hughes went over to the Independents, and later to the Plymouth Brethren. In 1832 he wrote, under the pseudonym \\"Cristion\\", on church establishments and tithes in controversy with the Rev. Evan Evans (Ieuan Glan Geirionydd). Hughes died at Great Malvern 11 March 1863, and was buried in the cemetery there. Works Hugh Hughes, Portrait of William Jenkins Rees (1826) Carnarvon Castle and Town, 1850. A lithograph from the Welsh Landscape Collection at the National Library of Wales The earliest known work by Hughes is a portrait (dated 1812) of the Rev. John Evans (1723‚Äì1817) of Bala, which was engraved in Volume III of the Drysorfa. Hughes's major woodcuts appear in his Beauties of Cambria (Carmarthen, 1823) in which all the views were engraved by himself, 58 from his own drawings; he has been compared to Thomas Bewick. He also made lithographs of Welsh scenery. He made caricatures of the commissioners of education sent to Wales (1846‚Äì47). Some of his sketches, including a map of North Wales under the name Dame Venedotia, Pitt's Head near Beddgelert, and others of the neighbourhood of Snowdon, were published at Caernarfon. His sketch of Pwllheli and St. Tudwall's Road is in Humphrey's Book of Views. Hughes also published: * Hynafion Cymreig, a work on Welsh antiquities, Carmarthen, 1823. * Y Trefnyddion a'r Pabyddion, 1828(?). * Lectures delivered before the London Cymmrodorion, in Seren Gomer, 1831. * Y Papur Newydd Cymreig, 1836 (a Welsh newspaper), wrongly ascribed to another in Cardiff Eisteddfod Transactions, 1883. * Y Drefn i Ddyogelu purdeb Bywyd, 1849. * The Genteelers, a sarcastic political pamphlet. * Yr Eglwys yn yr Awyr, essay in Y Traethodydd, 1853. He also edited three volumes of sermons by his father-in- law, David Charles; the one published in 1846 contained a memoir. The holdings of the National Library of Wales include a collection of works by Hugh Hughes. Family Some time after 1823 Hughes married Sarah Charles, daughter of the Rev. David Charles of Carmarthen; she died on 28 December 1873 in Aberystwyth. Their three children died young.

She was denied on the basis of \\"good and sufficient reasons\\" and later went on to earn her Master of Arts at Columbia University in 1937.  Biography  Alice Jackson Stuart was born June 2, 1913, in Richmond, Virginia, to Dr. James Jackson and Clara Kersey. She was the oldest of three surviving children. Stuart was born to college educated parents who could afford to send her to college. As a result, Stuart attended Virginia Union University where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English. During her time studying undergrad, Stuart was a part of Virginia State College's Delta Sigma Theta chapter. In August 1935, Stuart became the first African American woman to apply to the University of Virginia for graduate studies. She was denied based upon the Jim Crow educational policies that existed during the time. The school board refused to explain the \\"good and sufficient reasons\\" for which she was denied entry. She later went on to attend Columbia University with the grant money she received from the Dovell Act. Stuart graduated in 1937 from Columbia University with a Master of Arts in English. In an interview with her only son, Julian Towns Houston, Julian described his mother as \\"in some ways a larger than life figure‚Ä¶ devoted to education, loved teaching, loved her students.\\" After graduating from Columbia University, Stuart went on to work at Bethune-Cookman College, Howard College, as well as many high schools. She was awarded a fellowship by the Ford Foundation which allowed her to travel around the country. Stuart died age 88 on June 13, 2001, a week after her grandson graduated from Harvard University.  Influences  After Stuart's application had been rejected by the University of Virginia, it became a controversial issue among the public. It caught the attention of some African American and student organizations in Virginia. The case even brought significant changes to the educational policies towards African American students of the State of Virginia at that time. After being \\"rejected respectfully\\" by the University of Virginia on her application for studying a Master of Arts in French,Application of Negro Student Rejected by University Board Stuart tried to seek advice and assistance from the NAACP. It is an organization which aims \\"to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination.\\" The NAACP \\"had threatened court action in an effort to compel the University of Virginia to admit a Negro graduate student\\".Post Graduate Negro School is AuthorizedUniversity of Virginia Case before NAACP The NSL wrote a highly publicized letter to the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia and President John Newcomb condemning their action. The students protested the Board's action \\"because it implies the desirability of continuing educational inequality\\". In order to address the case, the NSL scheduled an open forum for students to discuss this controversial issue.NSL Forum Discussion Held on Jackson Question This act put pressure to the University of Virginia because the President received half a dozen of similar letters from other NSL university branches. Despite the fact that racial segregation was still a common phenomenon in the United States in 1930s, the rejection of Stuart's application to the University of Virginia was controversial enough to push forward some changes in the State of Virginia. The State started to provide African American citizens with access to separate-but-equal higher education facilities. In 1935 December, the Virginia State Board of Education announced the setting up of a graduate department for African Americans at Virginia State University in Petersburg. It was the first graduate school for African Americans in Virginia. A resolution adopted by the State Board at its meeting read, \\"‚Ä¶it is recognized that such opportunities should be provided for the Negros.\\" Another change came in February 1936 in the Virginia General Assembly. It passed House Bill 470, the Dovell Act, which promised to pay qualified black applicants the additional amount of tuition and travel expenses required to attend school outside the state offering a similar course of study. The bill provided for the education of hundreds of African American students over the next 20‚Äì30 years. Because of the Act, Gregory Swanson finally broke the color barrier in 1950 and became the first African American student at the University of Virginia Law School.  Legacy  Several months after Alice Jackson got rejected from UVa, the Virginia State Board of Education created a graduate school for African Americans at Virginia State University in Petersburg in 1935. The following year, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Dovell Act (House Bill 470). This paid qualified black applicants' tuition and travel expenses to attend schools outside the state. In the 1980s, University of Virginia and African American students at the school honored her. Shortly after her death in 2001, the Virginia Senate approved Joint Resolution No. 40 to honor Jackson.Senate Joint Resolution No. 40 Though Jackson's actions were important in the long process of desegregation at UVa, the first African American student was not accepted at the graduate level until Gregory Swanson in 1950. Afterwards, African American students were slowly accepted at the graduate and undergraduate level.An Epoch of Change: A Timeline of The University 1955-1975 In 2012 Jackson was posthumously honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\" for her life's work.

These sightings have been claimed as evidence for alien visits by ufologists. Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission. UFO proponents see comments by astronauts or photos processed by NASA as one of the \\"strongest bodies of evidence\\" because they are considered to be of high trustworthiness; however, NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Robert F. Allnut, concluded in a 1970 letter, \\"after fifteen years of manned space voyages including space stations and landing on the Moon, spacemen have brought back not a shred of evidence -- verbal, photographic, or otherwise -- for the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, or 'UFOs'.\\" In 2009, footage from NASA was posted on YouTube by ufologists which \\"renew[ed] UFO conspiracy theories that the government is hiding knowledge about its interactions with intelligent life\\" by relying on a \\"lack of context\\" to promote a \\"collection of indistinct imagery and allegations\\". A number of the incidents were collected for an episode of the 2014 television series Are We Alone?. Incidents Some sightings involving astronauts or NASA include: During the Gemini 4 mission, pilot Jim McDivitt spotted an object that he described as a \\"white cylindrical shape with a white pole sticking out of one corner of it.\\" He took two pictures of it. His partner, Ed White, was asleep at the time. McDivitt maintains that it was some unknown but man-made piece of debris, while James Oberg argues that it was most likely the Titan II second stage of the craft. In a transcript of Gemini 7 mission, the astronauts mention a \\"bogey\\" which ufologists have claimed was a reference to a UFO. Oberg, based on his trajectory analysis of the mission, describes the astronauts' comments about a \\"bogey\\" as referring to booster-associated debris, and not a reference to some sort of UFO. The astronaut who made the comments, Frank Borman, later confirmed that what he saw was not a UFO, and that when he offered to go on the television show Unsolved Mysteries to clarify, the producers told him, \\"Well, I'm not sure we want you on the program.\\" Within the UFO community, stories have spread that Neil Armstrong was reported to have witnessed multiple UFOs during Apollo 11. An explanation was that the sightings could have been attributed to jettisoned components. Additional stories were accredited to a hoax spread by science fiction writer Otto Binder. Buzz Aldrin says his words were taken out of context from an interview in 2005 about the incident. During a 2005 spacewalk outside the International Space Station, astronaut Leroy Chiao reported seeing lights in a formation he described as \\"in a line\\" and \\"almost like an upside-down check mark\\". The incident was promoted as a possible UFO sighting in the television series Are We Alone?. Chiao later identified the lights as being from fishing boats \\"hundreds of miles below\\". In August 2013, according to NASA TV, astronaut Christopher Cassidy saw a UFO float past the International Space Station near its Progress 52 cargo ship. It was soon identified by Russian flight controllers as an antenna cover from the Zvezda service module.

It was established by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in June 2009 and the truck was designed by Colin Reedy. Dammeier also owns the truck and enterprise. The truck was built to resemble a pig, and has metallic enhancements that resemble a pig's snout and ears. The truck often parked at 6th Avenue and Pike Street in downtown Seattle, and at festivals and farmer's markets. Maximus Minimus announced on Facebook in April 2017 that it would not be opening. Fare The truck offered pork dishes, such as pulled pork sandwiches, chicken and vegetarian sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, pozole and coleslaw. Dishes were available in bold (maximus) and light (minimus) styles, based upon the types of sauces used. The maximus sauce was prepared with peppers, onion, fruit juice and beer, and was stronger and spicier in flavor, while the milder minimus sauce was prepared with tamarind, molasses and honey and had a sweet flavor. The truck used cheese sourced from Beecher's Handmade Cheese, an artisan cheesemaker and retail shop founded by Dammeier and based in the Pike Place Market in Seattle. The foods used were locally sourced and all natural. The truck's fare has been described as barbecue, but Dammeier has stated that it is not barbecue, and that the fare derives its flavor from the sauces used.

He is known especially for the Savonius wind turbine, which he invented in 1924.  Life and work  Savonius was born in H√§meenlinna, Finland, to Albin Laurentius Johannes Savonius (1856-1906) and his wife Anna Elisabeth n√©e Rydman (1859-1921). He was one of three sons, together with his brothers Maximilian Lars Helge and Odert Albin. As a young man he enjoyed experimenting with explosives. One such experiment, an attempt to mix red phosphorus with a knife and fork, cost him two fingers and the sight in his right eye. Savonius graduated from secondary school in Helsinki in 1901. Although he had originally planned to become an engineer, he decided to study architecture and graduated in 1906 with a degree in architecture from Helsinki Polytechnic. Nevertheless, he usually referred to himself as an engineer and occupied himself mainly with technical projects. He met his future wife, the Englishwoman Mary Appleyard (born 1884), through his brothers, who were students in her English class. He and his wife had seven children: four daughters (Moira Angela Hj√∂rdis (born 1914), Ann-Mari, Mary Henrietta and Gustava Elisabeth) and three sons (Klas Albin, Mark Adrian Briggs and Johannes Anthony (born 1916), who died in hospital on 8 March 1940 from wounds sustained in the Winter War). The family's house was in the town of Inkoo in Southern Finland, which Savonius designed himself. Charter of \\"Savonius & Company\\", 1920 On 8 October 1920 Savonius founded Savonius & Company, with his wife as a shareholder. Seven years after graduating from the polytechnic, he registered his first patent, for a snow melting device to produce drinking water from snow, and in 1920 he patented an optimized version of the device. In 1921, he patented a cooking device for rock fireplaces.Sigurd Savonius (22 June 1921). Kokapparat f√∂r h√§llspisar, Finnish Patent FI000000008500A. In the early 1920s, Savonius concentrated especially on the control of air flows and the use of wind power. In 1923, his attention was attracted by a rotor ship built by the German engineer Anton Flettner. The ship was propelled by two large cylindrical rotorsails, which stood as tall as masts and were rotated by an engine. The idea was to take advantage of the Magnus effect: the perpendicular force exerted on the enclosed cylinders as they spun at greater than wind speed. Savonius wondered whether the ship could be driven by a rotor apparatus operating by wind power alone, without the aid of an engine. He met with Flettner in the offices of his firm, Savonius & Company, on L√∂nnrotinkatu Street in Helsinki, and the two engineers conducted experiments there. By early 1924, Savonius had developed a rotor with a cylinder open to the airflow. The two oppositely arranged vanes in this cylinder produced a high rotor torque that could be used directly for energy production. It is not known whether he succeeded in propelling a ship primarily through the Magnus effect, as originally intended. But a short biography of Savonius has suggested that such an application could well be possible, provided that a technical solution is found to convert the rotational motion of the cylinders into thrust. This suggests a successful outcome for his research into the rotor as a suitable mechanism for ship propulsion. Savonius-like rotor kites demonstrate that the operating principle is useful and that in principle the rotor makes the Magnus effect available. This invention for the use of wind energy was patented in Finland in 1926 and later in many other countries. The name \\"Savonius-Rotor\\", under which the invention is still known today, was bestowed by the German patent authorities. In the same year that the Finnish patent was granted, Savonius published his book The wing-rotor in theory and practice. In addition to his eponymous rotor, Savonius also filed patents for inventions such as a wind turbine with autonomously regulated rotational speed, a system for light displays and showcases, and a ventilation system based on his rotor. Savonius‚Äô interest in wind flows ultimately became his undoing.

In solution, the resin is coated with positively charged counter-ions (cations). Anion exchange resins will bind to negatively charged molecules, displacing the counter-ion. Anion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins, amino acids, sugars/carbohydrates and other acidic substances with a negative charge at higher pH levels. The tightness of the binding between the substance and the resin is based on the strength of the negative charge of the substance.  General technique for protein purification  A slurry of resin, such as DEAE- Sephadex is poured into the column. The matrix that is used is insoluble with charged groups that are covalently attached. These charged groups are referred to as exchangers like cation and anion exchangers. After it settles, the column is pre-equilibrated in buffer before the protein mixture is applied. DEAE-Sephadex is a positively-charged slurry that will have electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged atoms, making them elute later than the positively-charged molecules in the interested sample. This is a separation technique used widely to discover specific proteins, or enzymes in the body. Unbound proteins are collected in the flow-through and/or in subsequent buffer washes. Proteins that bind to the positively charged resin are retained and can be eluted in one of two ways. First, the salt concentration in the elution buffer is gradually increased. The negative ions in the salt solution (e.g. Cl‚àí) compete with protein in binding to the resin. Second, the pH of the solution can be gradually decreased which results in a more positive charge on the protein, releasing it from the resin. Both of these techniques can displace the negatively charged protein which is then eluted into test tubes fractions with the buffer. The separation of proteins will depend on the differences in total charge. Composition of ionizable side chain groups will determine the total charge of the protein at a particular pH. At the isoelectric point (pI), the total charge on the protein is 0 and it will not bind to the matrix. If the pH is above the pI, the protein will have a negative charge and bind to the matrix in an anion exchange column. The stability of the protein at values above or below the pI, will determine if an anion exchange column or cation exchange column should be used. If it is stable at pH values below the pI, the cation exchange column be used. If it is stable at pH values above the pI then the anion exchange column can be used.

R-loops may be formed in a variety of circumstances, and may be tolerated or cleared by cellular components. The term \\"R-loop\\" was given to reflect the similarity of these structures to D-loops; the \\"R\\" in this case represents the involvement of an RNA moiety. In the laboratory, R-loops may also be created by the hybridization of mature mRNA with double-stranded DNA under conditions favoring the formation of a DNA-RNA hybrid; in this case, the intron regions (which have been spliced out of the mRNA) form single-stranded loops, as they cannot hybridize with complementary sequence in the mRNA.  History  An illustration showing how a DNA-mRNA hybrid forms R-Loops in the regions where introns have been removed through splicing exons. R-looping was first described in 1976. Independent R-looping studies from the laboratories of Richard J. Roberts and Phillip A. Sharp showed that protein coding adenovirus genes contained DNA sequences that were not present in the mature mRNA. Roberts and Sharp were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993 for independently discovering introns. After their discovery in adenovirus, introns were found in a number of eukaryotic genes such as the eukaryotic ovalbumin gene (first by the O'Malley laboratory, then confirmed by other groups), hexon DNA, and extrachromosomal rRNA genes of Tetrahymena thermophila. In the mid-1980s, development of an antibody that binds specifically to the R-loop structure opened the door for immunofluorescence studies, as well as genome-wide characterization of R-loop formation by DRIP-seq.  R-loop mapping  R-loop mapping is a laboratory technique used to distinguish introns from exons in double-stranded DNA. These R-loops are visualized by electron microscopy and reveal intron regions of DNA by creating unbound loops at these regions.King RC, Stansfield WD, Mulligan PK (2007). A Dictionary of Genetics. Oxford University Press 7.  R-loops in vivo  The potential for R-loops to serve as replication primers was demonstrated in 1980. In 1994, R-loops were demonstrated to be present in vivo through analysis of plasmids isolated from E. coli mutants carrying mutations in topoisomerase. This discovery of endogenous R-loops, in conjunction with rapid advances in genetic sequencing technologies, inspired a blossoming of R-loop research in the early 2000's that continues to this day. =Regulation of R-loop formation and resolution= RNaseH enzymes are the primary proteins responsible for the dissolution of R-loops, acting to degrade the RNA moiety in order to allow the two complementary DNA strands to anneal. Research over the past decade has identified more than 50 proteins that appear to influence R-loop accumulation, and while many of them are believed to contribute by sequestering or processing newly transcribed RNA to prevent re-annealing to the template, mechanisms of R-loop interaction for many of these proteins remain to be determined. =Roles of R-loops in genetic regulation= R-loop formation is a key step in immunoglobulin class switching, a process that allows activated B cells to modulate antibody production. They also appear to play a role in protecting some active promoters from methylation. The presence of R-loops can also inhibit transcription. Additionally, R-loop formation appears to be associated with ‚Äúopen‚Äù chromatin, characteristic of actively transcribed regions. =R-loops as genetic damage= When unscheduled R-loops form, they can cause damage by a number of different mechanisms. Exposed single-stranded DNA can come under attack by endogenous mutagens, including DNA-modifying enzymes such as activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and can block replication forks to induce fork collapse and subsequent double-strand breaks. As well, R-loops may induce unscheduled replication by acting as a primer. R-loop accumulation has been associated with a number of diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4), ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), Aicardi‚ÄìGouti√®res syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome, and cancer. R-loops, Introns and DNA damage Introns are non-coding regions within genes that are transcribed along with the coding regions of genes, but are subsequently removed from the primary RNA transcript by splicing. Actively transcribed regions of DNA often form R-loops that are vulnerable to DNA damage. Introns reduce R-loop formation and DNA damage in highly expressed yeast genes. Genome-wide analysis showed that intron-containing genes display decreased R-loop levels and decreased DNA damage compared to intron-less genes of similar expression in both yeast and humans. Inserting an intron within an R-loop prone gene can also suppress R-loop formation and recombination. Bonnet et al. (2017) speculated that the function of introns in maintaining genetic stability may explain their evolutionary maintenance at certain locations, particularly in highly expressed genes.

During the undefeated 1900 football season, the Tigers were not once scored upon, posting shutouts in every single game that they played. The College's largest margin of victory was 110‚Äì0 over Virginia Medical College in 1913; largest margin of victory over a conference foe was 70‚Äì0 over Richmond in 1901; and largest margin of defeat was 0‚Äì136 to VMI in 1920. Football was introduced to the college by William Ford \\"Billy\\" Bull in 1892 after he matriculated as a freshman. Bull was also the captain of the squad for the team's first match up against Randolph‚ÄìMacon College in 1893, a bitter rivalry known as The Game ‚Äì the oldest small-school rivalry in the South ‚Äì which has been contested 119 times. Bull led the Tigers to a record of one win and two losses over his three seasons as head coach, earning the College's first victory in 1894 with a 28‚Äì0 win over William & Mary. The Tigers' first winning season came in 1896 under the tutelage George H. Denny, an alumnus of H‚ÄìSC. Denny would later go on to be the president of the University of Alabama and the original namesake of Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium. The only years that H‚ÄìSC did not field a football team were in 1904 and 1943 due to a large percentage of the student body being drafted into the war. Hampden‚ÄìSydney was an independent from 1892 through 1899. In 1900, the school joined together with William & Mary, Richmond, and Randolph‚ÄìMacon to form the Eastern Division of the Intercollegiate Association until 1921. In 1946, the Tigers joined the Mason‚ÄìDixon Conference and remained a member until the conference disbanded in 1975. In 1975, H‚ÄìSC joined as a charter member of the Virginia College Conference which was quickly renamed the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) in 1976. The College's first long- term coach was alumnus \\"Yank\\" Bernier, who coached the team from 1912 to 1916 and again from 1923 to 1938. Bernier also holds the distinction of being the first athletic director for the college. The school saw its first real success in football when another alumnus, J. Stokeley Fulton, became the head coach in 1960, serving in that role until 1984 when he succumbed to cancer. Fulton is the longest tenured Hampden‚ÄìSydney head coach with 25 seasons and is the all- time winningest coach in school history compiling a 143‚Äì99‚Äì5 record. Fulton, inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, lead his team to 9 conference championships, back-to-back Knute Rockne Bowls in 1971 and 1972, and was voted as the ODAC coach of the year 3 times. The Tigers are currently coached by Marty Favret who was hired in 2000. Going into his 16th season, Favret has won 5 conference championships (2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014) and has coached the Tigers to 6 Division III playoff appearances. The success that Favret has had on the field (compiling a 111‚Äì46 record and 71% winning percentage) has resulted in Tiger home football games becoming one of the most highly attended sporting events in all of Division III athletics ‚Äì in 2012 Hampden‚ÄìSydney averaged 6723 fans per game, ranking 3rd nationally. Through the 2015 season, Hampden‚ÄìSydney has compiled an official overall record of 545 wins, 452 losses, 38 ties; won 32 conference titles; appeared in 2 bowl games; and earned its way into 7 Division III tournament appearances with the most recent being in 2014.

The country in the city: the greening of the San Francisco Bay Area. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007. Print.] In the late 1970s and early 1980s CBE expanded to California, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Today, CBE is active primarily in California having established itself in San Francisco in 1978 and expanded to Los Angeles in 1982. CBE, now based in Oakland, CA and Huntington Park, CA, has succeeded in affecting communities throughout California, including: Richmond, East Oakland, Vernon, Huntington Park, Boyle Heights, Pacoima, Wilmington, and SE Los Angeles.[30th anniversary program booklet \\"CBE: 30 Years of Resistance, vision and Hope\\" 10/30/08, at the City Club, SF] CBE was the first environmental organization to practice door-to- door canvassing by directly involving community members. In 1980 CBE won the United States Supreme Court decision Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment 444 U.S. 620 protecting the 1st and 14th Amendment Rights of door-to-door activists with CBE and countless other public interest organizations. CBE's early combination of grassroots organizing with research and legal work provided the innovative edge needed to challenge large scale industries, refineries, and policies. About CBE aims to strengthen low- income communities of color to achieve environmental health and justice by reduction and prevention of pollution, while creating a network of sustainable communities. CBE focuses on urban areas which maintain a disproportionate concentration of low-income minorities with some of the poorest environmental health conditions due to heavy pollution from refineries, ports, power plants, freeways, etc.Mission & Vision Communities for a Better Environment These communities are more susceptible to cancer and diseases including asthma, heart disease, premature deaths, birth defects, etc. CBE values environmental and social sustainability as an intrinsic right for all humans to access clean air and drinking water regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ability, nationality, or income.Environmental Justice Communities for a Better Environment CBE is committed to empowering the community by giving organizational skills, leadership training, legal, scientific, and technical assistance to communities that may effectively fight injustice and create durable change. = Early work= CBE began to set the precedent for water, air, and toxic pollution advocating for community concerns and environmental regulation. In 1977, CBE organized with community members against the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Francisco, California.Walker, Richard. The country in the city: the greening of the San Francisco Bay Area. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007. Print. In 1983, landmark report and investigation of Bay Area toxic secretion, \\"Toxics in the Bay\\", held Chevron and others accountable of toxic discharge in the 1985 Basin Plan Discharge Program. The Basin Plan expanded to become the San Francisco Bay Region Basin Plan in 2004. The plan complied with California State and Federal anti-degradation policies awaiting approval by San Francisco State Water Board and the US Environmental Protection Agency.http://www.epa.gov/waters/tmdldocs/39084_SONOMA%20SEDIMENT%20TMDL.pdf CBE pressured Bay Area Quality Management District to reevaluate permit granted to Kaiser Cement and Gypsum Corporation resulting in sulfur dioxide reduction by 50%. As well as, limited use of perchloroethylene, a.k.a. Tetrachloroethylene, in Vallejo, California dry cleaners. Research approach Several studies support the idea that low-income communities of color bear the burden of unequal access to a healthy environment, which prioritizes CBE's effort to work with communities to fight such injustices. CBE focuses on educating low-income communities of color and advocating engagement by community meetings, political education, and school groups where people are empowered to fight local pollution by working together towards achieving healthier communities.How we create change Communities for a Better Environment CBE also values scientific research to fully comprehend the direct and indirect consequences of toxicity and chemical secretion. Using secondary data and partnering with health providers and academic institutions, CBE practices human subjects research and online training for human subject protection via the National Institute of Health website.Brown, Phil, Rachel Morello-Frosch, J G Brody, Rebecca Altman, Ruthann A Rudel, Laura Senier, Carla P√©rez, and Ruth Simpson. \\"Institutional review board challenges related to community-based participatory research on human exposure to environmental toxins: A case study.\\" Environmental Health 9.1 (2010): 4. Print. They are effectively committed to finding ‚Äòwho‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô the most affected communities are today, as well as ways of prevention for the community's tomorrow. CBE uses Community-based participatory research, by actively working together to gather their own research, which increases knowledge and awareness of local issues by creating a community where members are encouraged to participate in fighting against pollution.Why We Research Communities for a Better Environment Outreach and awareness are promoted by leading toxic tours of oil refineries, ports, and facilities where community members share their personal stories sparking advocacy and a better understanding about pollution.Toxic Tours Of Los Angeles The pay-it-forward affect, has the ability to reach thousands of communities by encouraging active participation against injustices. =Case studies= 1\\\\. Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change: A Case Study of the Southern California Environmental Justice Collaborative. CBE collaborated with Liberty Hill Foundation and an academic research team from University of California, Santa Cruz, Brown University, and Occidental College to have Rule 1402 reviewed. Rule 1402, included in the South Coast Air Quality Management District was the state's goal in 1994 to reduce public health risk from cancerous and noncancerous emissions by large industries. The maximum individual cancer risk was initially set at 100 cancer risks per million, yet due to CBE's collaboration, it was reduced to 25 cancer risks per million 6 years later, representing a reduction in acceptable risk levels to 75%. This collaboration led to more efforts in the reduction of allowable risk level faced by various communities and encouraged the California Environmental Protection Agency to broaden their view on issues such as these, to put more emphasis on risk exposure when making new policies. 2\\\\. Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy Objectives for Environmental Justice and Breast Cancer Advocacy: The Northern California Household Exposure Study. CBE's research contributed to an investigation of a high amount of pollutants increasing a woman's chance of getting cancer. In the United States, African American women have the highest rate of cancer and mortality than any other race. Studies reflect their chances are higher even when African American women have the same accessibility to mammograms and other treatments as white women. In a study done by Brody et al. indoor and outdoor air pollution, compared Richmond communities near oil refineries and shipping facilities with communities in Bolinas, a rural town just north of San Francisco found that Richmond had a higher concentration of pollutants in their indoor air. The study brought awareness to how indoor air can indicate and reflect outdoor air quality. CBE worked to set up various sampling equipment in the interviewers‚Äô homes, making the research more personal by having the interviewee feel comfortable with sharing their stories. The research method also allowed the community to be more knowledgeable of where the chemicals around them came from. By becoming aware, they are able to get involved in environmental justice and begin voicing their opinion. CBE connected scientific research with the personal aspect of interviewing which reassures people that they are not only a ‚Äòtest subject‚Äô, but those that have an honest voice in the fight for justice. Organizing California campaigns =Northern California= CBE uses their Community Based Participatory Research method in cities throughout California, focusing on northern and southern California. They focus on Richmond, California and East Oakland to make sure both cities have the resourced needed to reduce pollution. Richmond is known for the Chevron Richmond Refinery, emitting various carcinogens to the communities that surround it. Oakland is home to the Port of Oakland which emits particulate matter and various fumes from the diesel trucks that transport material to and from the location. Oakland *Neptune Society is a crematorium that planned to operate in East Oakland, exposing homes, churches, and schools to toxic emissions. The crematorium was trying to work without a permit that would force them to regulate the amount of the pollutants emitted. In order to prevent such facilities from operating without a permit, CBE created an Emergency Ordinance plan that would prevent any crematorium from opening without first receiving a Major Conditional Use Permit (CUP) from the city and ensure that they were being regulated under California Environmental Quality Act. Not only did this stop Neptune Society from opening, but it also paved the way for future crematoriums from operating without harsh enforcement. *CBE also has partnerships with community organizations like the Allen Temple Baptist Church to make sure that Oakland residents are aware of new projects that are being planned but also that they are able to participate. *Diesel trucks play a main role in transporting material from the port of Oakland, exposing the communities adjacent to the route ways to pollutants. CBE decided to investigate this and conducted a study to show the effects it has on the community. Based on the report, East Oakland is the most affected by the fumes released by the trucks. CBE also fought for alternatives routes for trucks to take so that they can transport material avoiding going near vulnerable communities and minimizing their exposure. *Oakland is often considered a food desert and CBE is working on increasing communities‚Äô access to healthier food options. They have created an alliance with Sowing Seeds program with several east Oakland groups that work on developing healthy gardens throughout Oakland. *There are synergistic effects that can be more toxic that one effect alone, and CBE released a report supporting this. With pollution and lack to healthy food access, one of CBE's initiatives is to create Green Zones across the state, where CBE works to: > #Stepped up regulation and enforcement to hold polluting industries > accountable; #A community voice in making land-use decisions; #Land use > policies that prevent new pollution projects from locating in these > communities; #Focused private and public investment in local economic > development; #Support for businesses in the Green Zone that want to ‚Äúgreen > up‚Äù operations; #Greening these communities by creating more parks, > community gardens and urban farms, and developing green businesses and jobs. Chevron Richmond refinery CBE and two organizations conducted the research in the Richmond health survey and it showed that the chemical exposures in Richmond were extremely high. When contrasted with Bolinas, as seen in the case study, Richmond's air pollution was far worse and this can be due to the Chevron Refinery. Chevron is the largest employer in town but as CBE research has shown, compared with the statewide average for all business activity oil refining creates ten times fewer jobs. *In 2009, CBE and other local organizations filed a petition to have the Chevron Refinery's plan to expand looked at once more. Expanding its facility would have allowed them to process dirty crude oil, increasing greenhouse gases and toxic emissions to local communities. The expansion was stopped because CBE argued that the Environmental Impact Statement violated the California Environmental Quality Act since it didn't take into consideration how this would increase the pollution in the city. *Richmond came up with the General Plan 2030, and its goal is to become more sustainable and also develop healthy neighborhoods by 2030. As part of this plan, Richmond's Planning Commission supported CBE's campaign, Less Pollution, More Jobs in 2012. This campaign enforces regulation in facilities that emit toxic chemicals, and it would require them to use energy efficient equipment. =Southern California= CBE works with various southern California communities especially the most polluted in the country. The Los Angeles area, Riverside communities, San Bernardino, and Orange County were ranked the smoggiest area in the nation in 2012 when it comes to air pollution. CBE works with other cities in southern California like Wilmington, Huntington Park, and the various cities that surround the Interstate 710, to minimize the exposure from residents living near it. The Southern California offices are also well versed in community active with subgroups of youths joining CBE ranks to fight environmental injustice in their heavily impacted, people of color communities. Beginning in 1997, the sub-program Youth for Environmental Justice has extended in numbers over the past few years, displaying influence in California's capitol, Sacramento; to providing support to at the grassroot march in Paris 2016. Huntington Park *Huntington Park is near the Los Angeles area and air pollution is not the only environmental problem because it has a lot of ‚Äúbrownfields‚Äù, which are abandoned or unused land used for activities that may have left the land contaminated. As of now the EPA is funding this project and the city of Huntington Park, CBE, and local residents have begun the transformation from brownfield areas into sustainable areas. Wilmington Area *CBE and other community groups are working with the Wilmington/Carson area that is exposed to high amounts of local pollution. This exposure puts those communities at risk for various diseases, mainly cardiovascular and respiratory ones. These communities have proposed a policy, which is Clean up, Green Up, and hopes to reduce and prevent pollution throughout mainly affected communities. This policy hopes to create Green Zones in these communities where the shift to green, sustainable communities will be encouraged. *The Clean Up Green Up policy was approved in Los Angeles City Council in 2011, and since then CBE has been working alongside the community in order to make this policy provide stronger regulation to polluting facilities. I-710 *The Interstate 710 freeway is 23 miles long and it runs from the Long Beach port to the City of Alhambra. There has been planning to expand the I-710 in order to make it easier to transport to and from the port, but many oppose it because it will increase pollution leading to more exposure to the communities around it. CBE worked with other organizations to create the Community Alternative 7 plan, which calls for improvements to be made along the I-710 to minimize pollution. Collaborations and coalitions As an active statewide California environmental justice organization, CBE has built a number of strategic alliances over its 34 years of work to work with partners that share a common vision of building power in marginalized communities. They are one of many organizations that make up the California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA), which organize in communities affected by pollution, working towards getting better protection for their community and environment. Over 35 community-based organizations, including CBE, make up the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) where they work towards the usage of sustainable energy in local communities. Grassroots Global Justice Alliance (GGJ), is made of various community groups including CBE, working with communities of color faced with the most environmental pollution and toxics. In regards to the expansion of the I-710, CBE and the Coalition for Environmental Health and Justice (CEHAJ) have worked together to create the Community Alternative 7 to improve the environmental conditions along I-710 corridor. CBE focuses on the people employed by toxic facilities and works with Don't Waste LA, in order to create a proposal for community protection to further exposure. This proposal would require them to reduce toxic waste. Green LA Coalition, Communities for a Better Environment, and other environmental justice groups, are focusing on LA in order to minimize the communities‚Äô exposure to pollutants. In the chevron case CBE also worked alongside Asian Pacific Environmental Network to have Chevron's permit reviewed. Local Clean Energy Alliance is made up of 70 organizations that call for renewable energy, pollutant reduction, and green jobs in California. It is also a member of the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative (BAEHC) working towards the reduction of pollution in vulnerable low income communities of color. CBE and Ditching Dirty Diesel work to bring awareness and advocacy on the issue of health problems and diesel pollution correlation. CBE also has a partnership with Richmond Equitable Development Initiative's to brainstorm activities which may increase the communities‚Äô advocacy for a specific problem. CBE has been a member of the Oakland Climate Action Coalition (OCAC), their efforts have allowed the inclusion of climate justice and health policies into the Oakland's Climate Action Plan. CBE in the media In recent media, Communities for a Better Environment is mentioned as being an expert in environmental issues advocating policy, organizational strategies, and seen on the forefronts of current issues and cases.

He was a member (academician) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of Ukraine and the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was also a director of the Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology and the International Center of Molecular Physiology NAS of Ukraine; chair of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Kyiv branch, vice-president of the NAS of Ukraine, and chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR.  Biography  Platon Kostyuk was born in Kyiv to the family of the Ukrainian psychologist Hryhoriy Kostyuk. A native speaker of both Ukrainian and Russian, Kostyuk studied English and German, and graduated from high school when the German-Russian War began in 1941. Kostyuk entered Stalingrad University to study biology and Roman philology. He was later evacuated to Siberia where he studied medicine till 1945. After half a year of military medical service, he was demobilized for entry into the Department of Biology at Kyiv University. In parallel he studied psychiatry at Kyiv Medical Institute. Kostyuk worked on his doctoral thesis in Danylo Vorontsov's laboratory of physiology. In his research, he developed microelectrode equipment independently of Judith Graham Pool and Ralph W. Gerard (1949). He completed his doctoral thesis in 1957. In 1958, Kostyuk became Head of the Department of General Nervous System Physiology at the Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology.

History and details The National Survey of Family Growth is conducted in five-year cycles. In each cycle, surveys are administered via personal interviews with people at homes. The interviewees generally comprise only the civilian, non-institutionalized population. The cycles so far have been: * Cycle 1, started 1973 * Cycle 2, started 1976 * Cycle 3, started 1982 * Cycle 4, started 1988 * Cycle 5, started 1995 * Cycle 6, started 2002 * 2006-2010 NSFG * 2011-2013 NSFG * 2013-2015 NSFG * 2015-2019 NSFG (results will be released in 2020) While Cycles 1-5 surveyed only women, Cycle 6 and later surveyed both men and women and used households as the unit of analysis. Cycle 6 surveyed 12,571 respondents 15‚Äì44 years of age: 7,643 females and 4,928 males. The 2006-2010 NSFG surveyed 22,682 interviews: over 10,000 interviews with men and more than 12,000 interviews with women. In 2006, the NSFG shifted from periodic surveys to continuous interviewing. For Cycle 6 onward, the surveys were conducted in person by female interviewers who are hired and managed by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. The survey samples are intended to be nationally representative but not necessarily representative at subnational levels (such as individual states, ethnicities, or religions). Data For the survey cycles that have been completed, data is available both in the form of portable document format summaries and as full data files. In addition, program statements are available in SAS, SPSS, and STATA. Key statistics are also browsable online. NSFG data is also mirrored on the website of the University of Michigan's Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. Reception and impact =Claims= The NSFG website claims that the NSFG is used as follows: * by scholars in the behavioral sciences (e.g., sociology, demography, and economics) to study marriage, divorce, fertility, and family life; * by scholars in public health to study reproductive, maternal and infant health topics; * by agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services, to brief senior officials and to inform program decision-making, in research programs and in health and social service programs. * by state and local governments to plan health and social service programs; * by private-sector research organizations which distribute the information to the public and to policy makers; and * by the press, to prepare articles on a number of topics related to health and family life. =Academic research= The NSFG website claims that the NSFG has been cited in \\"more than 600 journal articles, NCHS reports, and book chapters shown in our publication lists.\\" The research citing the NSFG is concentrated more on topics related to family planning, contraception, abortion, and fertility.

It is the second adaptation of V. C. Andrews‚Äô 1979 novel of the same name. A sequel, Petals on the Wind, based on the novel of the same name, premiered on May 26, 2014 on Lifetime. The network announced the developing of the following books in the series, If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday, which both aired in 2015. Plot In the late 1950s, the Dollanganger children ‚Äî 14-year-old Chris, 12-year-old Cathy, 5-year-old twins Carrie and Cory ‚Äî live happily with their parents, Christopher and Corrine, in Pennsylvania. This changes when Christopher dies in a car crash, leaving the family devastated and heavily in debt. Four months later, Corrine announces they are going to go live with her wealthy parents in Virginia. She explains that she was estranged from her parents and changed her last name because of this. On arrival at Foxworth Hall, Corrine's grim, claustrophobic and cold-hearted mother, Olivia, takes the children to a small room in the attic. The next day, the children are given a list of rules and Olivia tells them to stay in the attic at all times. Corrine explains that her father, Malcolm, disowned her for eloping with Christopher, who was actually her biological half-uncle (her father's younger half-brother) and they were disinherited. She promises the children she will make her father forgive her; once he has forgiven her, she will introduce him to the children, and they will live happily together at Foxworth Hall. Corrine's visits to the attic become less frequent as she begins to enjoy her new-found wealth and starts a relationship with her father's lawyer, Bart Winslow. She informs the children that while her father has forgiven her, she can't let them meet him because she claimed that she didn't have any children; thus, they will have to remain in the attic until Malcolm dies. Corrine's visits all but cease during the next year. Due to lack of fresh air and sunshine, the twins' growth has severely stunted; meanwhile, Cathy and Chris are entering puberty. Chris accidentally walks in on Cathy while she is trying on her first bra. Olivia catches them and calls them sinners and tries to cut off Cathy's hair as punishment. Chris stops her, but she threatens to starve them for a week if he doesn't cut Cathy's hair himself. Cathy and Chris refuse to comply and give their remaining food to the twins while they rely mostly on water. Olivia appears to relent and leaves them a basket of food; however, Cathy awakens to find tar in her hair the next morning. As Chris reluctantly cuts her hair, he tells her that he finds her beautiful, but knows it is wrong to think of her like that. Another year passes and Corrine hasn't visited in months. Cathy and Chris conclude that their mother has abandoned them and begin planning their escape. When Corrine does return, she happily announces she has married Bart and the reason for her absence was her honeymoon in Europe. She is upset that the children are not more excited and seems oblivious to the deterioration in the twins. Olivia soon brings the children sugar-powdered doughnuts, which she says are a gift from their mother. Olivia beats Chris with a belt after he demands to be called by his name rather than \\"boy.\\" Cathy tends to his wounds and admits her fear of losing him. Chris assures her nothing will happen to him and they kiss. When Olivia comes to deliver their food, Chris tells her that she was right about them being the \\"devil's spawn\\" and pleads for forgiveness. After she leaves, Chris reveals the whole scene was a scheme to get an impression of the attic key in soap, and he carves a wooden copy. Now able to leave the attic, Cathy and Chris begin to steal money from their mother's room to finance an escape by train. On a night raid, Cathy finds Bart asleep and kisses him. Chris later overhears his mother and Bart talking about a dream of a young, blonde-haired girl coming into the room and kissing Bart. Chris angrily confronts Cathy, who assures him that the kiss meant nothing and she only did it out of curiosity. She kisses him and they end up having sex. Cathy suggests they move to Florida and Chris tells her that he loves her and can never love anyone else. Cathy tells Olivia and Corrine that Cory is sick and demands her mother take Cory to a hospital, threatening revenge if she doesn't. The next day, Corrine tells them Cory had pneumonia and died, and has already been buried. Devastated by Cory's death and in fear for their lives, Cathy and Chris decide to take all the money they have collected and grab as much jewelry as they can to finally escape. During their search for valuables, they discover that Corrine and Bart have left Foxworth Hall. Chris overhears a conversation between the butler and a maid, and learns that Olivia has been leaving poison to kill \\"the mice\\" in the attic and that their grandfather died seven months ago. Cathy shows Chris how Cory's pet mouse has died after eating a piece of powdered doughnut, revealing that the poison was in their food. Olivia then comes to take their key, and Chris restrains her long enough for Cathy and Carrie to escape. Olivia chases after them, but panics due to her claustrophobia when Chris shuts the door and turns the lights off. Olivia tells them that their mother was the one who poisoned them, not her, but they ignore her and climb out the window, fleeing on foot. During their escape, they run into the butler, who realizes they are Corrine's children. Horrified, he tells them to run while he cuts off the electric fence for them. They board a train to Florida and Chris assures her that their ordeal is finally over. Cathy vows revenge on their mother.

A conservation scientist is a museum professional who works in the field of conservation science and whose focus is on the research of cultural heritage (e.g. art, artifacts, buildings, and monuments) through scientific inquiry. Conservation scientists conduct applied scientific research and techniques to determine the material, chemical, and technical aspects of cultural heritage. The technical information conservation scientists gather is then used by conservator and curators to decide the most suitable conservation treatments for the examined object and/or adds to our knowledge about the object by providing answers about the material composition, fabrication, authenticity, and previous restoration treatments. Responsibilities and duties The main responsibility of a conservation scientist is to provide analytical and technical support for the preservation and restoration of cultural objects using scientific analysis and techniques.Whitmore, P. (Eds.). (2005). Conservation Science Research: Activities, Needs, and Funding Opportunities. (A Report to the National Science Foundation). Retrieved April 13, 2014. These tasks are accomplished primarily in four ways: 1.) the identification of materials and fabrication of an object, 2.) studying the degradation mechanisms of the objects, 3.) developing and testing conservation-restoration treatments, and 4.) developing and testing new analytical techniques and equipment. Each task is properly documented by conservation scientists with such information as composition, condition, history, and suggested treatments. Additionally, many of these tasks require conservation scientists to collaborate with other museum professionals and industrial/mainstream scientists in order to properly accomplish them, in particular with conservators and curators (see Related positions). =Identification= Conservation scientist using Raman spectroscopy at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The identification of an object‚Äôs component materials is the most basic of conservation science tasks. This is typically accomplished using non- destructive examination techniques or, if necessary, destructive analytical techniques designed for small samples (see Instruments and uses). The information yielded about the object‚Äôs material composition aids in the development of preventive conservation measures- such as lighting and humidity controls-and the selection of appropriate restoration treatments. The analysis of materials can also lead to discoveries about the object‚Äôs origin and fabrication.Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (2013). Conservation Science. Retrieved April 13, 2014. Such studies, called technical art history, can provide insight into the time period of an object, its authenticity, the artist, and previous restoration treatments. In addition to leading to new interpretations, this information impacts the selection of treatments by conservators and conservation scientists. =Degradation= Another key focus of conservation science is studying the degradation or deterioration mechanism of objects. Using chemical analysis, conservation scientists can determine the underlying material processes (i.e. aging and chemical reactions), risk factors, and environmental conditions causing the objects to degrade.The Getty Conservation Institute. (2013) Science Department. Retrieved April 13, 2104. This information can then be used by conservation scientists, in collaboration with conservators, to develop appropriate treatments for objects, in particular treatments that can provide long-term stability and preservation for the examined object. =Development of conservation-restoration treatments= The continuing development of new conservation materials (e.g. cleaning solvents) and techniques is an essential aspect of the conservation of cultural heritage. This research ensures the continued existence of cultural heritage in the best condition possible considering their age and degradation. Conservators often rely on conservation scientists for their scientific knowledge and skills in the development of these materials and treatments. Conservation scientists are asked to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of current materials and treatments, to improve those material/techniques, and to devise new materials and techniques. The goal is to develop conservation treatments and materials that can slow the degradation of materials and further damage effectively and without harming the object. =Development of new analytical techniques and equipment= In addition to developing conservation treatments and materials, conservation scientists collaborate with industrial scientists and instrument manufactures in the development of new analytical techniques and equipment.Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). Conservation Science. Retrieved April 13, 2014. Conservation scientists are constantly looking for and developing new techniques and instruments that improve the condition and treatment of objects. To this end, scientists are developing new techniques and instruments to: decrease and eliminate the need for sampling objects to minimize collateral damage, better analyze materials, document results, improve ease (e.g. portability), improve environmental monitoring. =Education= In addition to their scientific responsibilities, conservation scientists have a duty to help educate new conservations scientists, the conservation field, and the public as part of their ethical code.(AIC. (1994). Core Documents: Code of Ethics. Retrieved April 21, 2014. To ensure the continuation and quality of their profession, conservation scientists are involved in the training of new conservation scientists as members in academic conservation departments, adjunct faculty, and as mentors to those in fellowships, internships, and entry-level jobs. Conservation scientists also help educate the conservation community at large by disseminating their research to promote the growth and use of the best conservation practices and materials. Lastly, conservation scientists educate the public about conservation science to promote awareness of about the field and its importance to the preservation of our cultural heritage. Knowledge, abilities, and skills The basic knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by conservation scientists are: *advance knowledge in a physical or applied science discipline (e.g. physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology) *basic knowledge of conservation and relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, fine arts, etc.) *critical thinking and creative problem solving *the ability to formulate and carry out researchEPISCON.

Such non-destructive methods include visual examination, advanced imaging techniques, and X-rays.Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (n.d.). Conservation Science. Retrieved April 19, 2014. Sometimes, sampling an object is unavoidable. In these cases, microscopic fragments are removed from the object- rarely visible to the naked eye- and their original location is documented. The scientific and ethical demands of a conservation scientist require a variety of instruments- taken from mainstream science and slightly modified- in order to conduct their research properly.

Education and training There is much discussion and debate in the field of conservation science about the amount and type of education and training that should be required for people entering the field. Currently, there is no one set path to becoming a conservation scientist. A 2013 survey conducted by the International Center for the Study of Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) on the education and training paths for conservation scientists worldwide concluded that: This survey demonstrates that there is no worldwide consensus on the type and amount of education and training needed to become a conservation scientist, resulting in regional and institutional variations. In the United States, the most common route taken is an advanced degree in a physical, natural, or applied science discipline such as physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology.Trentelman, K. (Summer 2005). Training and Education in Conservation Science. GCI Newsletter, 20.2. Retrieved April 13, 2014. Master‚Äôs degrees are acceptable, but most conservation scientists have their PhD. In fact, a doctoral degree is becoming an increasingly common requirement for even entry-level conservation science positions. A basic knowledge of conservation theory and practice, art history, and/or other relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. archaeology, anthropology, fine arts, history, etc.) is also essential. Scientists seeking to enter the field typically gain this experience and knowledge through postdoctoral fellowships. There are several postdoctoral programs in particular for scientists to receive specialized training in conservation science, including those at the National Gallery of Art (the Charles Culpepper Fellowships), Harvard University Art Museum, and the Getty Conservation Institute. Numerous museums and cultural institutions also have individual advanced training fellowships in conservation science through such organizations as the Kress Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies (NU-ACCESS) is one example of an Andrew W. Mellon funded fellowship.Northwestern University.

Professional organizations As a unique mixture of academic disciplines, conservation scientists may join an assortment of professional organizations to suit their varied needs and specializations. These organizations may include those dedicated solely to conservation science, conservation, or a related science field. Many of the general conservation and related science organizations, in fact, have specialized groups for conservation science.
