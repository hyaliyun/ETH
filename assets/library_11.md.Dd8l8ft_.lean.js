Currently, the gallery displays more than 33 drawings, seven paintings, and other items belonging to the artist.

Aside from Henri's works, the Henri Museum also houses items owned by the Cozad family that relate to the history of Cozad. The town was founded by Henri's father, John Jackson Cozad.  History  The Henri Museum building was originally a house that was built by John Jackson Cozad in 1873. In 1883, Cozad shot a local rancher named Alfred Pearson in Cozad. This shooting resulted from in a dispute over cattle that later escalated in a shouting match, a brawl and gun violence. The mortally wounded Pearson would die a month later. After the shooting, Cozad fled town for Denver. Although Cozad was acquitted in the killing, His wife and sons soon sold the house and left town forever. To escape notoriety, son Robert Henry Cozad changed his name to Robert Henri. The Cozad house later became the home of artist Miles Maryott.

The Henri Museum was founded by a women's coalition led by Shirley Paulsen. The coalition purchased the Cozad house, then known as the Hendee Hotel. They also purchased an adjacent historical walkway, a Pony Express Station, an historical church, and a schoolhouse. The coalition purchased the property with donations from the Henri and Cozad families and other local residents. In 2014, the Henri Museum installed a quality climate control and security system.

It is located in the center of the historic city center, as well as in the middle of the main street of the city, that is corso Federico II di Svevia. Moreover, Altamura Cathedral, the main church of the city, is located on the square. It is also known because the Tree of Liberty was planted in this square during the so-called Altamuran Revolution (1799).  History  The square has always been in the center of the city of Altamura, both in terms of position and importance. One of the most crucial decisions about the square is undoubtedly the intervention of Frederick of Naples who, in 1494, bought several houses located in the area where today is the square and had them demolished in order to enlarge the square.pupillo-immaginie, p. 26 Rocca, kept in Angelica Library, Rome|upright At the time it was known because there was an important daily market and the prices of foodstuffs were decided inside the square. Moreover, in front of the entrance of Altamura Cathedral (the area of the current palazzo Melodia), there was a refuge for the poor, known as hospitium maioris ecclesie. In the 16th century, the premises were turned into ten shops with arcades and it remained property of the cathedral, which rented the premises according to emphyteusis to private individuals. The existence of those ten shops is also confirmed by the drawing P/33, dating back to the late 16th century and stored in the Angelica Library of Rome; the doors in the drawing are exactly ten. In the 18th century, the shops were the only place where meat could be bought in the city, because of the tax on meat to be paid to the cathedral.pupillo-immaginie, p. 26 As shown in the same drawing (P/33) of Angelo Rocca, today's clock tower hadn't been built at that time yet. It was built in 1858 based on a project by the architect Corradino de Judicibus.http://prolocoaltamura.it/it/tag/personaggi- it/ Previously, in the same place where today it is the clock tower there was the seggio, a sort of stage in which the representatives of both nobles and commoners met in order to discuss the issues the city had to face. Initially, the seggio was located in the area of the current chapel of San Biagio (alongside the Church of San Nicola dei Greci); in the end of the 16th century, it was moved to the area where the clock tower is located now; in 1654, it was demolished and rebuilt in the same place.pupillo-immaginie, p. 27 Close to the area of the current clock tower, Altamura Cathedral also had an additional rose window as well as normal windows; al of them were walled and they are no longer visible.pupillo-immaginie, p. 26  A fight  On July 1, 1580, a fight broke out in the square, which involved Epifanio Corrado and Graziano Filo.

Graziano Filo first attacked Epifanio Corrado, \\"who wounded fell to the caissons of the square, where the fruits were sold\\".

Background Mr. Thompsons father who was also called Thomas Thompson originally came from Nantucket and was of a quaker family. The family was wealthy. In a Boston pamphlet published in 1846 entitled Our First Men, which lists the names of the most prominent and wealthiest people of the city, one can find the Thompson family. Mr. Thompson was sent to Harvard University in 1817, and was the classmate of George Barrell Emerson, Caleb Cushing and George Bancroft. He was an honors student, and already from a young age interested in art and nature. Art collection Mr. Thompson started collecting art early, and the first inventory of his collection is dated 1844. Unfortunately most of his art collection was stored at the Tremont Temple in Boston, which was divested in a fire in march 1852. Thompson writes on April 5, 1852 to the secretary of the city's Board of Engineers; At your request I transmit a statement of my loss by the late fire in the Tremont Temple. I have been twenty years making the collection recently deposited there. My estimate of the loss ‚Äì that is, the lowest cost ‚Äì $92,456 on the pictures, although I do not think that they could be replaced to-morrow for a hundred and fifty thousand. However, Thompson almost immediately started building up a new collection, and it was said that his aim was to gift his collection to the city of Boston. However, Thompson moved from Boston to New York, and the gift to Boston was never materialized. Instead the collection was sold of after his death at an auction witch started in New York on February 7, 1870. The sale was organized by his estate, and conducted by Thompson's brother-in-law, George Presbury Rowell, who also served as the estate executor to his sister, Thompson's widow, Elizabeth Rowell Thompson.

His wife, Elizabeth, survived him by more than 30 years and soon after the turn of the 20th Century, his trustees began making grants and have continued to do so for over a hundred year. The instruction to the trustees, made by Thompson simply states that; apply the net income of the trust fund... for or towards the relief and support, of poor seamstresses, needle-women and shop girls, who may be in temporary need from want of employment, sickness or misfortune, in the towns of Brattleboro, Vermont, and Rhinebeck, Duchess County, New York.

It was built from 1874 to 1875. It is also known as Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services and Archives, ACS and Denholme. The property is owned by Aboriginal Children's Service Ltd. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 July 2015.  History  History of the suburb of Redfern The area now known as Redfern was once defined by sand hills and swamps, which would have provided an abundant supply of food for the Gadigal people before white settlement (the Gadigal are a clan of the Eora Nation). Although colonization was destructive, Gadigal culture survived. As the town of Sydney grew, the Gadigal were joined by other Aboriginal people from around NSW to live and work as an urban Aboriginal community. Redfern was one such place where Aboriginal people sought shelter and connection with family and community and continue to do so today. The name Redfern originates from an early land grant to William Redfern in 1817. It was previously known as Robert's Farm and Boxley's Swamp. The boundaries of Redfern's grant were approximately the present-day Cleveland, Regent, Redfern and Elizabeth Streets. Redfern's grant was subdivided and advertised for sale in allotments of between in 1834. George Street was named in a subsequent Redfern Estate Subdivision Sale in 1842. The passing of the Sydney Slaughterhouses Act in 1849 brought industry to the district. This Act banned abattoirs and noxious trades from the city so many tanners, wool scourers and wool-washers, boiling down works and abattoirs moved their businesses outside city boundaries to Redfern and Waterloo. The sand hills still existed but by the late 1850s Redfern was a flourishing suburb housing 6,500 people.SHI 5045257 The Municipalities Act 1858 gave districts the option of municipal incorporation. Public meetings were held and after a flurry of petitions Redfern Municipality was proclaimed on 11 August 1859, the fourth in Sydney to be formed under the Act. Redfern Town Hall opened in 1870 and the Albert Cricket Ground in 1864. Redfern Post Office came in 1882. By the end of the 19th century Redfern consisted of a mix of market gardens, industry and housing. House located at 18 George Street 18 George Street first appears in the Sands Directory in 1871 as a piece of vacant land next to a boot maker. The first reference to a building on the site is the residence \\"Denholme\\", home of John Williamson Solicitor in 1875. In 1873 John Williamson solicitor had an office at 126 Elizabeth Street and was living in Manono Cottage in Cleveland Street, Redfern. By 1876 John Williamson solicitor of Elizabeth Street is noted as having his private residence in George Street, Redfern. The house called Denholme, 18 George Street, Redfern must therefore have been built between 1873 and 1875. John Williamson resided at 18 (listed as 20) George Street until 1889. By 1890 the house was still called Denholm (although without the e) and the new the resident was Frederick Chapman, prothonotary. (A prothonotary was a Clerk of the court.) On the adjacent corner were King and Grills grocers. Redfern Municipal Council was amalgamated with the City of Sydney in 1949 and was one of the few municipalities to produce a Town Plan. The Town Plan, completed in 1948, was not implemented but involved demolition of all the housing stock and construction of tower blocks set in park land.Historical Atlas of Sydney 18 George Street would have been demolished if this plan had been implemented. Aboriginal activism The twentieth century saw increased political activism amongst Aboriginal people and the growth of organisations for the achievement of changes to the constitution. Poor housing and living conditions increased demand for services and facilities for urban Aboriginal people. Having a large Aboriginal population, the suburb of Redfern was a particular focus for activism around civil and land rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the 1960s and 1970s Aboriginal people living in Redfern were the subject of unofficial policing methods such as a ten o clock curfew. If an Aboriginal person was found on the street after 10pm they were arrested whether or not they had committed any crime. In 1970 a group of activists came together to provide legal representation for Aboriginal people who were otherwise unaware of their rights. Paul Coe, Isabel Coe, Gary Williams, Gary Foley and Tony Coorey sought help from Hal Wootten, the Professor of Law at the University of New South Wales and together they set up the Aboriginal Legal Service. The service was based in Redfern and received a small amount of funding from the Australian Government. The Redfern Aboriginal Legal Service was so successful it led to the creation of similar services around the country.Dictionary of Sydney In July 1971 another groundbreaking service for Aboriginal people was established in Redfern. The Aboriginal Medical Service provided free health care to the Aboriginal people. The service helped provide nutrition advice as well as general health care for people who were often living in crowded conditions. One of the founders of the service was Shirley Smith (Mum Shirl).Barani/ City of Sydney Around this time a men's group was busy providing a fruit and vegetable program as well as a breakfast program to ensure families received nutrition and at least one meal a day was available to those in the community who needed it.Ann Weldon There were other pioneering organizations around this time that were established by the Redfern Aboriginal community. These include the Aboriginal Housing Company, Black Theatre and Murawina. In 1972 a development company started buying large blocks of housing and forcibly evicting the Aboriginal tenants. With the help of the Builders Labourers Federation a group of people reoccupied some of the properties and refused to move. The BLF placed a ban on development. In 1973 the Aboriginal Housing Company was incorporated and granted federal funding to purchase \\"the Block\\". Black Theatre was an Aboriginal-run theatre company established in 1972. Murawina started as a breakfast program in Newtown in 1972 and became a child care centre in Redfern in 1974 and then grew to take on other roles such as housing referrals and a meeting place for Aboriginal women. Later that decade in 1979 saw the founding of Aboriginal Dance Theatre Redfern (ADTR) and in 1981 Radio Redfern commenced with a small slot on 2SER. (Dictionary of Sydney) Redfern in the 1970s was a pivotal place in the revolution taking place in Aboriginal affairs in Australia. Aboriginal people were actively resisting oppression and successfully organizing themselves to overcome poverty, housing issues and poor health care. Providing services for Aboriginal children was a part of this revolution in autonomy and a reaction to the continued removal of children and the need for culturally-specific foster care. In 1969 the Aborigines Protection Act was abolished, officially ending the routine removal of Aboriginal children from their families under the policy of assimilation. By 1985 however the Standing Committee on Social Welfare acknowledged the problems still inherent in the child welfare sector whereby there was a \\"...reluctance of welfare authorities to accept the basic differences between Aboriginal and non--Aboriginal societies in terms of family concepts and child care practices, particularly the concept of the extended Aboriginal family and the complex system of kinship relationships and obligations that are of fundamental importance to the Aboriginal childrearing process.\\"Connecting Kin, 16. Aboriginal people publicly voiced their concerns that Aboriginal children must be fostered with Aboriginal families and kinship ties considered in child placements at the First Australian Conference on Adoption held in 1976. It wasn't until 1987 however that the Aboriginal Child Placement Principle was developed, although the Redfern Aboriginal Child Services had been taking this approach from the very start of their organization 11 years earlier.Connecting Kin, 17. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services was started in 1975 and provided a range of child welfare and family support services with a particular focus on foster care. MumShirl, Isobel Coe, Bev Coe, Jenny Munro and Ann Weldon are some of the women who were involved in its success. Initially funding was provided by Australian Catholic Relief and later the NSW Department of Community Services took over the funding arrangements. Australian Government also provided grants intermittently. The Canberra Times in July 1978 reported that the Department of Social Services announced a grant of $18,550 to Aboriginal Children's Services in Redfern at the start of \\"National Aborigines Week\\". The grant was to fund the leasing and furnishing of a house and employing a house parent to give Aboriginal children temporary emergency accommodation. The service was provided with NSW government funding until 2008 when it was withdrawn. It was considered that among other things, ACS did not meet contemporary training, accommodation and governance requirements. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services found that demands for increased accountability to government and escalating service costs in an environment of diminishing resources put undue pressure on the organisation. The service continues today with sponsorship from a not for profit organization, undertaking a variety of charitable works and advocacy. Establishment of the Aboriginal Children's Service The creation of the Aboriginal Children's Service was in direct response to the cultural issues Aboriginal children faced when fostered to non-Indigenous families. The Canberra Times reported in 1980 of a study by sociology students from the University of NSW which demonstrated Aboriginal children were repeatedly fostered in white families and in institutions. The article quotes the study as follows: \\"The placing of Aboriginal children in white foster homes has a very high failure rate, according to the findings of the Aboriginal Children's Service. The service finds that Aboriginal children are on average placed with three or more different families. Aboriginal children who have been removed from their families often spend considerable periods in establishments run by the various institutions. . . . Few reasons are offered, by those who deal with Aboriginal children, for the continued institutionalization of them other than they continue not to conform to white patterns of socialization.\\" The article concludes that Aboriginal children should only be adopted by Aboriginal families and that Aboriginal community organizations such as ACS must be the focal point for adoptions; experience having shown that they were more successful in dealing with the culturally specific needs of Aboriginal children.The Canberra Times, 30 December 1980. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services were instrumental in the change in child welfare policy in NSW. The Redfern organization, established by the community and run by mostly volunteers, changed the way in which Aboriginal children's services were provided in NSW ; these changes remain in place today. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services also influenced mainstream policies which led to the current practice known as \\"kinship care\\" where priority is given to placing the removed child with family members. In the case of an Aboriginal child if no family member is available the child is placed with an Aboriginal family within their community. If no Aboriginal carers are available then the child will be placed with non-Indigenous carers but given access to the Aboriginal community.Family and Community Services There are numerous Aboriginal women associated with Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services whom played a vital part in its establishment and ongoing success. (There were 6 Wiradjuri women involved in the foundation: Colleen Shirley Perry, Isabel Coe, Jenny Munro, Vilma Ryan and Sylvia Scott). Colleen Shirley Perry was a Wiradjuri woman born on Erambie Mission, West Cowra, New South Wales, around 1924. Her extensive work providing support for prisoners earned her the name \\"MumShirl\\". She was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire and Member of the Order of Australia for her welfare work. She raised 60 foster children over her lifetime and was involved in the establishment of the Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services. Isabel Coe was also a Wiradjuri woman who was from the Erambie Mission. She was one of the Aboriginal activists involved in setting up the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra in January 1972 and kept it going in the 1990s. She played a key role in setting up many important organizations in Redfern, including the Aboriginal Children's Services. In the 1990s she was a member of the Indigenous Advisory Council supporting the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families.The Australian Women's Register 2012 An early worker at the Redfern ACS was Jenny Munro when she began working at the Aboriginal Children's Service as a trainee bookkeeper and then as Administrator in 1979. She was also actively involved in advocacy for policy change with regards to Aboriginal children. She was a member of the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) in its early days, and one of its first chairpersons. Vilma Ryan has worked at the Aboriginal Children's Service, being a voice and guide for hundreds of Aboriginal Children caught up in the court system and working towards getting them placed in foster home care with Aboriginal carers. She has also sat on the board of directors at Redfern's Murrawina Preschool and has long been a vocal advocate for Aboriginal education. In 2000 she was a torch bearer for the Sydney Olympics. Her long time indigenous activist and being a proud Wiradjuri woman has seen her being recognised with a 2012 NSW Seniors Week Achievement Award. Sylvia Scott was born on a mission in Cowra, working with Aboriginal women she founded Murrawina pre-school for Aboriginal children, one of the first aboriginally run organisations in Sydney where she served as their president for 17 years. In the 80's Sylvia also set up a general skills program at Petersham TAFE and worked at the Children's Hospital Camperdown as an Aboriginal health worker. She died in hospital aged 83 in 2011. The service was located in a number of locations prior to the move to 18 George Street. In 1980 it was located at 31- 33 Regent Street, Redfern and the director at that time was Ann Weldon. Weldon is a member of the Wiradjuri Nation and was one of the founding members of the NSW Aboriginal Children's Service and Inner West Aboriginal Community Company. Ann has held executive positions on a number of boards and committees for over three decades, including the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council and Marrickville Aboriginal Consultative Committee. Among Weldon's achievements was being the first female CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service and the first CEO of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. Weldon has also been elected to the Sydney ATSIC Regional Council as a Councillor and as the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson. Weldon was appointed to the NSW Aboriginal Housing Board in 1998. In 1975 Aboriginal Children's Services were also established at Cowra, St Marys and Wagga Wagga. The demographic in Redfern today has changed substantially since the 1970s. The suburb has become increasingly gentrified and Aboriginal people have been moved on to areas such as Waterloo. Services supporting the Aboriginal community have followed. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services is now an increasingly rare example of the community based services which were once available in Redfern.  Description  18 George Street is a three-storey (split level) Victorian Filigree style gentleman's town house with an attic and additions to the rear. Constructed in 1874 the building has a spacious interior on the ground floor and large bedrooms upstairs.

There is a steel garage addition to the rear and the area beside the rear wing has been enclosed.  Condition  As at 9 May 2014, the guttering has failed in some cases and is in urgent need of maintenance. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services building is highly intact. The intactness of the archive is unknown.  Heritage listing  As at 20 November 2014, the Redfern Aboriginal Children's Service & Archives is of state significance because it was instrumental in bringing about a substantial shift in government policy regarding the care of Aboriginal children as well as being influential in the introduction of the \\"kinship care\\" policy for non- Indigenous children. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services & Archives provides evidence of cultural and traditional ways of cooperating and caring for each other being translated to an urban setting. Along with Redfern Aboriginal Legal Service, the Aboriginal Housing Company and the Aboriginal Medical Service, the Redfern ACS was one of the pivotal Aboriginal organizations in the 1970s revolution in self-determination that occurred in Redfern. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services at 18 George Street, Redfern is now a rare example of Aboriginal service providers as the suburb has become increasingly gentrified and the services have left with the Aboriginal population. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services & Archives is an early example of children's services established by Aboriginal people specifically for the placement of Aboriginal children. The service is an excellent example of resistance against the policy of removing Aboriginal children from their family, culture and community and successfully establishing kinship ties as an important consideration in child placements. 18 George Street is an excellent example of a building adapted for use by Aboriginal Children's Services. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services has historical association with a number of key figures in Aboriginal politics and welfare provision including Isobel Coe, Jenny Munroe, Mum Shirl, Ann Weldon, Vilma Ryan and Sylvia Scott. 18 George Street also houses important historical archives documenting the operation of ACS, including information about each foster child. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 July 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services was instrumental in bringing about a substantial shift in government policy regarding the care of Aboriginal children that were removed from their parents. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services also influenced policy for non-Indigenous children leading to the current practice known as \\"kinship care\\" where priority is given to placing the removed child with family members. In the case of Aboriginal children the emphasis is placed upon finding culturally appropriate carers, something that was not considered important prior to the establishment of the Redfern ACS. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services provides evidence of the revolution in Aboriginal self- determination that occurred in Redfern in the 1970s. The service demonstrates the displacement caused by government policy and the success of the Aboriginal community in reclaiming their right to care for their own kin and run their own affairs. The Redfern ACS is an integral part of the story of Redfern. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The establishment and ongoing running of the Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services is associated with several influential Aboriginal women whose activism led to social change including Isabel Coe, Ann Weldon, Colleen Shirley Perry (Mum Shirl), Jenny Monroe, Vilma Ryan and Sylvia Scott. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 18 George Street is a multi level free standing town house that demonstrates the Victorian Filigree architectural style and exhibits the aspirations of a gentleman solicitor in 1874. There are parts of the interior which relate to its use by the Aboriginal Children's Services such as the double sided mural in the entrance hall. The building has aesthetic value at a local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services has strong social significance for the contemporary Aboriginal community in Redfern, Sydney and NSW for a number of reasons. The place is symbolic as a safe place for Aboriginal children who were placed in care with kinship consideration. The hundreds of children who passed through the Redfern ACS would be expected to have strong memories of the service as it played a role during their removal from their parents. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services provides evidence of cultural and traditional ways of cooperating and caring for each other being translated to an urban setting. The Redfern ACS has always played a charitable role in the community and continues to do so today with services such as a free food delivery service and playgroup for mothers in the neighbourhood. For the past and present workers at Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services the place has spiritual significance as it is occupied by the spirit of ancestors/ board members who have passed on but continue to inhabit and care for the place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are substantial archives relating to the complete history of the Redfern Aboriginal Children's Service held on site. These archives have the potential to provide significant information about the organization as well as containing the records about each child that was fostered through the service. These archives have an elevated level of significance as no history of the service has been prepared to date and because adults who were fostered through the service may seek to inspect the records in order to connect with kin. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services played a pivotal role as the original service from which other services grew. It has rarity as a surviving symbol of the organization. Redfern Aboriginal Children's Services is now a rare example of the once numerous pioneering organizations for the well being and advancement of Aboriginal people that were based in Redfern but have recently moved on to other areas due to the gentrification of the suburb. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

At the time the settlement was proposed the area which is now situated in the Malaysian state of Sabah was under the administration of the British North Borneo Chartered Company. The Filipino settlement was proposed to be governed autonomously under British North Borneo. Rizal envisioned the settlement after residents in his native Calamba, Laguna were left homeless after the resolution of a land dispute in favor of the Dominican friars. Location New Calamba or Nueva Calamba was planned to be established in North Borneo in an area situated near the Bengkoka River and Maradu Bay. Rizal has negotiated with the governor of North Borneo to lease at least or of land for 950 years for the establishment of the settlement with the option to purchase thousands of acres more. History Calamba land dispute Plans to set up New Calamba was due to a land dispute in Calamba, Laguna in the Spanish governed Philippine islands. The dispute originated from a directive of Governor General Emilio Terrero y Perinat ordering for the investigation of estates owned by Dominican friars as an effort to resolve agrarian issues and problems in collection of land taxes and tenancy upon the request of Jos√© Rizal. Rizal was in turn urged by tenants in Calamba to call for an investigation regarding the hacienda owned by the Dominican Order which was later found out to consist of not only the area around Calamba but the whole town. Rizal's actions drew the ire of the friars. The Supreme Court of Spain made a decision regarding the case and the Madrid-based court ruled in favor of the Dominicans recognizing their proprietorship over the disputed lands in Calamba and ordered the tenants of Calamba to leave the hacienda within 12 days or face expulsion. Among those tenants were Rizal's family. When Valeriano W√©yler, an ally of the friars, took over as Governor General succeeding Terrero, implemented the decision by sending 50 soldiers from the peninsular regiment of artillery to expel the tenants and burnt their houses. Conceptualization Jos√© Rizal began conceptualizing the idea of establishing a Filipino settlement in North Borneo while he was on a trip to Hong Kong. In the British colony, Rizal shared the concept to Englishman W.B. Pryor and his wife who were en route to North Borneo. Based on a letter addressed to Ferdinand Blumentritt dated on February 23, 1892, Rizal was thought to consider relocating his family to North Borneo where he plans to establish a Filipino settlement geared towards agriculture with himself as their leader. Rizal observed what he perceive was better governance of the British of their colony, Hong Kong compared to the Spanish's administration of the Philippines particularly their harsh treatment of the island's natives. Attempted establishment Rizal prepared an agreement with the British North Borneo Company by January 1892. The North Borneo company proposed the permanent settlement of Filipinos in North Borneo, the sale and lease of lands in the area where they could settle for 999 years, and an arrangement that would allow the settlers to govern themselves while remaining under the jurisdiction of the company. Aware that he would need the consent of the Spanish colonial government for the resettlement of evicted residents of Calamba to North Borneo, Rizal wrote a letter to Governor General Eulogio Despujol on March 21, 1892 to seek permission to do so. Within the same month, Pryor, whom Rizal met back in Hong Kong informed Rizal that North Borneo needs manpower with British inviting Rizal to visit Sandakan. The North Borneo company further offered the construction of buildings and plantation of orchards for the planned Filipino settlement in an arrangement where settlers would pay for the cost which is payable in three years. Rizal entered into a negotiation with the acting Secretary of the North Borneo Government in the absence of the territory's governor. The secretary recorded the conditions of the proposed settlement in writing. Rizal later met with the Governor of North Borneo on April 6, 1892 before leaving for Hong Kong via the Memnon the following day. Spanish opposition Jos√© Rizal upon his arrival in the British colony of Hong Kong received the official position of the Spanish colonial government from its consulate in Hong Kong regarding his plan for a Filipino settlement in North Borneo. Governor General Despujol did not reply through letter but through a consul, Despujol informed Rizal his rejection of the plan which he viewed as \\"anti-patriotic\\" due to labor shortage in the Philippines. The plan was also viewed with suspicion fearing that a Filipino colony in North Borneo could be used to launch a Filipino revolution against the Spanish colonial government. He also invited Rizal to meet with him in Manila to discuss the plan and Rizal accepted the invitation despite objections from his friends fearing for his safety. On June 26, 1892, Rizal arrived in Manila and had a series of meeting with Despujol at the Malaca√±ang Palace before he was arrested after he was found to possess leaflets critical to the clergy which was planted by friars. Rizal was put into detention at Fort Santiago before he was executed. His death was later credited to have contributed to the Philippine Revolution. Governance New Calamba would have been part of British North Borneo but would have some degree of autonomy. Residents are excluded from free labor or conscription except if the territory's sovereignty was placed under threat.

It was designed by James Hume. It is also known as Fitzroy Crescent. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  History of the suburb of Redfern Redfern's natural landscape was defined by sand hills and swamps. The Carrahdigang, more widely known as the Cadigal people, valued the area for its abundant supply of food. The name Redfern originates from an early land grant to William Redfern in 1817. It was previously known as Roberts Farm and Boxley's Swamp.Murray, 2009, 5 William Redfern (1774?‚Äì1833) was a surgeon's mate in the Royal Navy and was aboard HMS Standard when its crew took part in the revolt in 1797 known as the Mutiny of the Nore. Because he had advised the men to be more united, he was included among leaders who were court-martialled. Although sentenced to death, he was reprieved because of his youth and in 1801 arrived in Sydney as a convict. He served on Norfolk Island as an assistant surgeon. In 1803 he was pardoned, but remained on the island until 1808, when he returned to Sydney and was appointed assistant surgeon after being examined in medicine and surgery by Surgeons Jamison, Harris and Bohan. In 1816 he took charge of the new Sydney Hospital, but maintained a private practice. In 1814 he reported on conditions on convict transport ships and his recommendation that all have a surgeon on board whose duties were to superintend the health of convicts was put into practice. He resigned from Government service in 1819 when not appointed to succeed D'Arcy Wentworth as principal surgeon. Despite his valuable service, many were contemptuous of him as he was an emancipist, although he had the friendship of Governor Macquarie. In 1818 Redfern received a grant of in Airds (in today's Campbelltown area) and later received more land in the area and by his death in 1823 he owned, by grant and purchase, over in NSW. In 1817 he had been granted in the area of the present suburb of Redfern. The boundaries were approximately the present-day Cleveland, Regent, Redfern and Elizabeth Streets. The commodious home Redfern built on his land was considered to be a country house, surrounded by flower and kitchen gardens. His neighbours were John Baptist (at the Darling Nursery in today's Chippendale) and Captain Cleveland, an officer of the 73rd regiment, remembered by today's street of that name, and before its demolition, by Cleveland House, his home.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 219‚Äì220 The passing of the Sydney Slaughterhouses Act in 1849 brought other businesses to the district. This act banned abattoirs and noxious trades from the city. Tanners, wool scourers and wool-washers, fellmongers, boiling down works and abattoirs had 10 years to move their businesses outside city boundaries. Many of the trades moved to Redfern and Waterloo ‚Äì attracted by the water. The sand hills still existed but by the late 1850s Redfern was a flourishing suburb housing 6,500 people. The Municipalities Act of 1858 gave districts the option of municipal incorporation. Public meetings were held and after a flurry of petitions Redfern Municipality was proclaimed on 11 August 1859, the fourth in Sydney to be formed under the Act. Redfern Town Hall opened in 1870 and the Albert Cricket Ground in 1864. Redfern Post Office came in 1882. The majority of houses in Redfern in the 1850s were of timber. From the 1850s market gardeners congregated in Alexandria south of McEvoy Street, around Shea's Creek and Bourke Road. When Sydney's original railway terminus was built in the Cleveland Paddocks, which extended from Devonshire and Cleveland Streets to Chippendale, the station's name was chosen to honour William Redfern. The station was built of iron and the first stationmaster was a Mr Fielding. In 1874 the station was replaced by a brick and stone structure, covering two platforms. At that time the present Redfern railway station was known as Eveleigh, after a lovely old home standing on the western side of the railway line. When Central railway station was built, on the site of the Devonshire Street cemetery, the name of Eveleigh Station was changed to Redfern. The name Eveleigh was retained for the huge railway workshops, just beyond the station, on the site of the original Hutchinson Estate. All that remains of the Cleveland Paddocks is Prince Alfred Park, where the exhibition building was erected in 1870 for an inter-colonial exhibition opened by Governor Belmore, after whom Belmore Park was named, on 30/8/1870. Redfern was the scene of the maiden trip of the first double-decker tram in 1879. It travelled between the old Redfern station to the corner of Hunter and Elizabeth Streets in the city.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 220 In 1885 the Sands Sydney Directory listed 54 market gardens. While many were worked by European-Australians, by the 1870s Chinese market gardeners had acquired leases in the district and a decade later were dominating the trade. The Eveleigh complex in 1886 became one of the largest employers in the state. Redfern was an industrial working class suburb by the end of the 19th century. Reschs brewery and other factories attracted migrants. The Syrian/Lebanese community began settling around Redfern and Surry Hills by the 1880s. Redfern at the end of the 19th century was characterised by its many gardens, but at the turn of the century industry was taking over the area. At that time, many businessmen in the area were from Syria, such as George Dan, who established his business in 1890; Stanton and Aziz Melick, in 1888; and Anthony & Simon Coorey, in the 1890s. Like other inner-city suburbs, the area still has a high migrant population, including many now from Lebanon, as well as a large Aboriginal population. There is still industry in the area among the high density residential occupation. In the 1940s 73 per cent of all industrial activity in Sydney was concentrated within a radius of from Redfern station. Many of its services have disappeared or been substantially downgraded over the last couple of decades, even though Redfern is still a densely populated inner city suburb. Fitzroy Terrace \\"Fitzroy Terrace\\" stands on part of of land which was first granted by Lieut. Governor Grose to Williams Robert on 8.1.1794, on the condition that he cultivate and improve the land. The land was then sold to John Boxley in 1800 and Thomas Laycock in 1805 for A¬£70. Mr. Laycock sold it to Mrs. Sarah Wills for A¬£100 on the same day. Mrs. Wills was later widowed and married George Howe, editor of the Sydney Gazette in 1811. Her eldest daughter married Dr. William Redfern. Dr. Redfern owned an adjoining which he consolidated with his wife's in a new grant issued by Governor Macquarie in 1816. Redfern was transported to Australia as a mutineer in 1800. He was pardoned in 1803 and rose to have the largest private practice in the colony which included both the Macquaries and the Macarthurs. Although an emancipist he was appointed to the magistracy by Governor Macquarie and was one of the first directors of the Bank of New South Wales. His Sydney estate of gave its name to the suburb of Redfern which developed around it. He was the first person to receive an Australian medical qualification, the first teacher of Australian medical students and the instigator of important reforms on board the convict transports. He returned to Scotland in 1828. Redfern's grant of was subdivided and advertise for sale in allotments of between in 1834.The Australian 7 March 1834 In 1842 the agent for the Redfern estate had the property surveyed and divided into allotments. Lots 10 and 12, Section 2 were sold to Mr. John Alexander who was responsible for developing the land. The Sydney Morning Herald advertised Fitzroy Terrace on 12 August 1846 in the following way: As Governor Fitzroy arrived in Sydney just after completion of the terrace it was probably named after him, and from the evidence contained in the advertisement, it was the work of James Hume an important architect practising in Sydney in the 1840s. Hume designed the Presbyterian Church in Wollongong (1839) and Goulburn (1839) and the Sydney Synagogue. He worked on St. Andrew's Cathedral before Edmund Blacket and Burdekin House. He has also been credited with the design of \\"Lindesay\\" at Darling Point. Fitzroy Terrace may be the only building by Hume still existence, Fitzroy Terrace owes a great deal to Regency concepts of design and is modelled in a unitary fashion. It an extremely rare, if not unique example, of its kind and of the work of Hume. The Sands Directory shows the early occupants of Fitzroy Terrace in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s as belonging to the professional and commercial middle class with occupations listed such as barrister, accountant, clerk, civil engineer.Source: Robert A.

Brown, Heritage and Conservation Branch, Department of Environment and Planning,1984 18 Pitt Street The front garden, with the exception of its framing cast iron picket fence, stone retaining walls and tiled paths and a -year old frangipani tree, hardly existed 15 years ago, when the subject elm tree, another planting, was installed by the then owners. The existing garden is generally sympathetic in form and content to the age of the terrace. The owner noted that photographs from 15 years ago showed nothing there then. The owner also noted two old Port Jackson fig trees (Ficus rubiginosa) in the rear garden, which are getting large and causing problems.John Allen, pers.comm., 2/2013  Description  Fitzroy Terrace is a colonial Georgian breakfront terrace of seven two-storey houses designed by the architect James Hume in 1846. It is built in stuccoed brick lined out in imitation of ashlar with the central terrace of three stones projecting forward with a gable roof. The gable attic is lit by a semicircular fanlight to the rear and a pivoting sash window to the front. The verandah to the ground floor is supported on simple timber chamfered posts with wide boarded veranda divisions. Most of the veranda roofs have been reinstated in timber shingles, the main roofs have been partially reinstated in slate the rest being of corrugated iron or terracotta tile. The building is simply detailed with the original six panel sash windows, six panel entrance doors with semi circular fanlights over French doors with margin glazing, opening out to the front garden in the centre terrace only. Internally the two up, two down houses retain their original simple cedar joinery, fireplace surrounds, stairway and panel doors. Original access to the servants room above the kitchen was by way of a trap door. Externally the houses are set back from Pitt Street, with tiled paths, cast iron picket fences and stone retaining walls. To the rear the separate skillion roofed kitchens have long since been joined to the main buildings by boarded timber links. Above the kitchen is a small storage room lit by a four pane pivoting window. Most houses still retain their out houses fronting the rear lane. Numerous extensions have in the past been made to the rear of the houses. In the case of No. 6 Pitt Street a very unsympathetic extension spoils the harmony of the rear elevation. 18 Pitt Street The front garden, with the exception of its framing cast iron picket fence, stone retaining walls and tiled paths and a c. 50-year-old frangipani tree, hardly existed 15 years ago, when the subject elm tree, another planting, was installed by the then owners. The existing garden is generally sympathetic in form and content to the age of the terrace. The owner noted that photographs from 15 years ago showed nothing there then. The owner also noted two old Port Jackson fig trees (Ficus rubiginosa) in the rear garden, which are getting large and causing problems.  Condition  As at 7 February 2002, Fitzroy Terrace have survived due to Redfern's social decline during the early 20th century. The building is in good condition, partially restored with potential for complete restoration. Terrace No. 16 and No. 18 have been sympathetically restored and the remaining terraces are in reasonable condition. The integrity of the building as a whole may be enhanced by the use of consistent roofing materials and colour schemes.  Modifications and dates  Separate ownership has resulted in alterations. The terrace was originally painted an ochre colour and the window frames a soft green. The front doors combined these two colours. Shudders were originally fixed to the ground floor windows and were probably painted a dark green. The verandah enclosures have recently been corrected but generally changes have been confined to the rear of the buildings. In March 2013 at 18 Pitt Street, an elm tree ( years old) was removed due to poor health.  Heritage listing  As at 6 April 2005, Fitzroy Terrace has historical significance as it stands on part of what was Dr. William Redfern's Estate. The Estate gave its name to the suburb of Redfern which developed around it and Fitzroy Terrace is representative of that development. The building is the work of James Hume an important architect practising in Sydney in the 1840s. Fitzroy Terrace has social and cultural significance as \\"purposely built\\" accommodation for the commercial and professional middle classes of the mid 19th century and has research potential for mid 19th century architecture within Australia .

Lyons, published by University of Illinois Press, which traces the development of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) during that time period. The author argues that, in the words of Maurice Berube of Old Dominion University, that improving society in general and the school system in particular as well as \\"the desire for bread-and butter gains through organizing\\" were the two major aspects driving the CTU.Berube, p. 221. According to Linda Marie Bos of Mount Mary College, the \\"fundamental theme\\" of Teachers and Reform consists of the ties between the teachers' unions and the teachers themselves.Bos, p. 130. Contents Bos stated that the emphases of the book are the Great Depression, World War II, the McCarthyism movement, and the Civil Rights Movement. According to Bos, the inclusion of the intersectional relationship between Civil Rights reform in race and gender and worker's rights, including collective bargaining, means that Teachers and Reform \\"extends the scholarship of the civil rights period\\".Bos, p. 131. The book has a chapter at the end \\"Teacher Power and Black Power reform the system,\\" which describes racial tensions in the CTU and its relationship with the Black Power movement; the CTU ultimately supported adding African-American studies to curricula and the hiring of additional African-American school administrators and school principals.Berube, p. 222. Bos added that the inclusion of the stories of individual teachers \\"personalizes\\" the book. Reception Bos described it as a \\"well-researched study\\". Berube described it as a \\"masterful scholarly study\\" and a \\"balanced, lucid, and insightful analysis\\".Berube, p. 220. Berube had been an employee of the United Federation of Teachers in New York City during the 1960s and had worked on a Black Power initiative to change the power structure of that city's public school system, and therefore Berube stated \\"In short, my experience and scholarship parallel that of Lyons‚Äôs study which strongly resonates with me.\\" References  Reference notes Further reading  * Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:University of Illinois Press books Category:Chicago Teachers Union ","title":"Teachers and Reform"},{"id":"58858521","text":"AD Andromedae (AD And) is an eclipsing binary in the constellation Andromeda. Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 11.2, but it shows a decrease of 0.62 magnitudes during the main eclipse and 0.58 during the secondary one. It is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable star with a period of almost one day. System The AD Andromedae system consists of two close main sequence stars of spectral type A0V. They orbit so close to each other that they have an ellipsoidal shape induced by their gravitational interaction. The presence in this system of a third body with a minimum mass of 2.21 has been proposed; however, it should give a significant contribution to the light emitted by the system, and has not been detected yet. A possible solution is for two unseen, but less massive and luminous, stars orbiting close to each other. Variability The orbital plane of the two stars is aligned to our line of sight, so each component eclipses the other when passing in front of it. In AD Andromedae this cycle repeats with a period 20 minutes less than one day. A cyclic variation of 14.3 years in the orbital period of this binary system has been reported, and this could be an effect of another body orbiting in this system.

Doyle, Jr. (Ret.), David Winkler, Naval History Association,1996-11-18, accessed 2018-10-10) was a Vice Admiral of the United States Navy, and the son of VADM James H. Doyle, USN. Early years Doyle was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the eldest son of James Henry Doyle and Eleanor Ruth (nee Fields) from Passaic, New Jersey, as his father's ship happened to be at Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs. The naval family moved regularly, to Panama, the Philippines, San Diego, Hawaii, Norfolk, Berkeley, and Washington, D.C.. His brother was born in 1939 while the family was in the Philippines. The family was at Honolulu, Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack in 1941, with his father commanding USS Regulus (AK-14). His ROTC unit was mobilized to guard the beaches against possible enemy landings. After the family's evacuation to Berkeley, Doyle met his high school sweetheart, Jeannette Eleanor Blair. They were married on 5 June 1946. Due to his disjointed schooling, Doyle needed a year of study at Drew Preparatory School in San Francisco before winning an appointment to the US Naval Academy by taking a competitive examination. Navy career Doyle entered the Naval Academy in June 1943, and graduated on 5 June 1946 in the Class of 1947, a three-year wartime training class that retained its four-year designation. He and Jeanette married later in the day, at the Walter Reed Army Hospital Chapel with a reception at the nearby Shoreham Hotel. Famous classmates of Doyle's included: President Jimmy Carter; former CIA Director Stansfield Turner; Admiral Worth H. Bagley; Admiral, later Ambassador, William Crowe, Ambassador to the Court of St James's and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Medal of Honor awardees, James Stockdale and Thomas Hudner; and US Senator Jeremiah Denton. Following a short period of training at Jacksonville, Florida, the newly-weds travelled to California for a month's leave, before Doyle left for Japan and service in USS Chicago (CA-136) leaving his wife to complete her degree at Berkeley. Doyle became the officer in charge of number three turret, with three eight-inch guns and around 30 sailors, as their Division Officer. He was also catapult officer for the embarked Curtiss SC-1 seaplane. He was sent back to do gunnery training at Coronado, California, then rejoined Chicago at Bremerton Navy Yard as the ship was inactivated. He was then posted to USS John W. Thomason (DD-760), a Sumner class destroyer based at San Diego, for three years, making two deployments to the Western Pacific. His wife lived at the Navy accommodation, the Hotel Del Monte, later the Naval Postgraduate School, at Monterey, California. He was quickly qualified by the Commanding Officer as an Officer of the Deck when sailing independently, while undertaking the duties of Combat Information Centre Officer and Communications Officer. In 1949, as the Chinese Communists moved across the Yangtze River and took control of the capital, Shanghai, the Thomason was involved uniquely as the communications relay for the American Ambassador. The ship then evacuated the embassy staff, and steamed down the Yangtze River at general quarters, with star shells bursting overhead. His eldest daughter was born while he was on this deployment. Legal training Doyle took his father's example and wished to do legal training. He was allowed three years at George Washington University law school (1950‚Äì53) that coincided with the Korean War, in which his father was Commander of the Amphibious Forces during the invasion of Inchon with General Douglas MacArthur aboard the flagship, and also participated in the Hungnam evacuation and the blockade of Wonsan. Among his professors at GWU was Dean of the school, Vice Admiral Oswald S. Colclough, who had served as Judge Advocate General of the Navy 1945-48 and Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC) 1948-49. Doyle received a degree of Juris Doctor with distinction, did the Washington D.C. bar exam, and was admitted to practice in California. First command After completing a short course at the Naval Justice School in Newport, Rhode Island, Doyle attended mine warfare school at Yorktown and then joined the USS Bulwark (MSO-425), at the Norfolk Navy Shipyard, as its Executive Officer. He saw the ship completed in the yard, and undertook the work-up and commissioning training and some deployments. In June 1954, Doyle became Commanding Officer of USS Ruff (AMS-54), a late World War 2 constructed ship for sweeping fixed mines. He relieved his predecessor at Panama City, Florida, and then sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, its home port, and spent a little under a year as CO. Ruff was going into maintenance, and Doyle was picked to proceed to Long Beach, California, and command USS Redstart (MSF-378) for a two-year tour. As well as fleet exercises, Redstart also deployed to the Western Pacific and operated out of Sasebo, Japan. During this period, the ship ran into the tail end of a typhoon and could only face into the swells and ride out the storm. Between June 1957 to June 1959, Doyle served in the Judge Advocate General's International Law Division, in Washington. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander during this posting. Hawaii He was next posted in June 1959 as Executive Officer of the USS John S. McCain (DL-3), a destroyer leader ASW/gun ship commissioned in 1953, the second of the Mitscher-class destroyers. It was based in Honolulu, Hawaii, but ‚Äò‚ÄôMcCain‚Äô‚Äô regularly deployed to the Western Pacific. In July 1960, Doyle became personal aide and flag lieutenant to Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood, then Admiral John H. Sides, responsible for the Admiral‚Äôs personal communications, schedule, and trip arrangements. He spent two years there, and was promoted to Commander. Doyle reported to USS John R. Craig (DD-885) as Commanding Officer for the final stages of its Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul at the Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard at San Francisco, California. This modernisation notably added the SQS-23 sonar, RUR-5 ASROC anti-submarine rocket and the unmanned Destroyer Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) to the lengthened hull. The ship did sea trials and fleet training in mid-1963, and relocated to its home port of San Diego. ‚Äò‚ÄôCraig‚Äô‚Äô deployed to the western Pacific to operate with the Seventh Fleet. During this period, ‚Äò‚ÄôCraig‚Äô‚Äô embarked special electronic countermeasures equipment and did a patrol along the maritime border of North Vietnam, to detect shore based gun fire control systems and communications between the systems. Shortly after, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred. Nuclear training and service While on a port visit to Subic Bay (Phippines) in ‚Äò‚ÄôCraig‚Äô‚Äô, Doyle was ordered to Washington for interviews with Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, head of Naval Reactors. Doyle already had orders to command USS Preble (DDG-46), a Coontz class anti-air missile ship mounting the RIM-2 Terrier. However, Doyle was selected for nuclear power training, first to the school for six months at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, then six months at the shore-based nuclear destroyer prototype power plant in West Milton, New York, completing training in June 1965. With no nuclear ship CO positions available, Doyle was ordered to be the Executive Officer of USS Newport News (CA-148) based in Norfolk, Virginia. The ship was the flagship of Commander Second Fleet, who was also Commander Striking Force Atlantic, a NATO Command. Doyle was selected to command USS Bainbridge (DLGN-25), but first had to pass the Nuclear Reactors ‚Äúcram course‚Äù in Washington. On passing, Doyle was personally presented with a large paperweight which was engraved on one side, ‚ÄúOh God, thy sea is so great and my boat is so small‚Äù, and the other side, ‚ÄúPresented to Captain James H. Doyle, Jr., USN, by Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover, USN.‚Äù He relieved Captain Hal Cushman Castle, USN, in the Gulf of Tonkin in December 1966, spending almost four years in command. In 1966-67, ‚Äò‚ÄôBainbridge‚Äô‚Äô operated with USS Long Beach (CGN-9) and the USS Enterprise (CVAN-65), primarily off Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf on Yankee Station supporting the ‚Äò‚ÄôEnterprise‚Äô‚Äô aircraft doing air strikes into Vietnam. However, there was a notable port visit: On 8 March 1967, ‚Äò‚ÄôBainbridge‚Äô‚Äô departed Vietnamese waters and arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, the port city of Perth, the capital of Western Australia, on 13 March. The total distance was about , at an average speed was . From there, the ship sailed 3,000 miles via the Lombok Strait (Indonesia) to Subic Bay, at an average speed of . Doyle then oversaw the first refuelling of ‚Äò‚ÄôBainbridge‚Äô‚Äô (September 1967 ‚Äì July 1968) at Mare Island and the following inspection by Nuclear Reactors staff and VADM Rickover. During its next deployment, ‚Äò‚ÄôBainbridge‚Äô‚Äô was accompanying ‚Äò‚ÄôEnterprise‚Äô‚Äô when that ship had a major fire onboard. For the 1970 deployment, ‚Äò‚ÄôBainbridge‚Äô‚Äô again visited Australia, this time related to the bicentennial of Lieutenant James Cook‚Äôs discovery landing on the east coast at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770. Washington Doyle then served in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (Admiral Elmo Zumwalt) in the Program Planning and Budgeting Office. This was involved in the early considerations of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT 1) and the Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM). In 1971, Doyle was selected for flag rank, and was posted into the joint environment at the request of Admiral Thomas Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the International Negotiations Division, for two years. He was on the US delegation for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea convened in New York in 1973. Flag command Following this, Doyle commanded Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12, homeported in Mayport, Florida. During this period, he deployed at sea twice, commanding an air task group from USS America (CV-66) for deployment preparations, and USS Forrestal (CV-59) in the Mediterranean during the tensions around Cyprus. Doyle was then selected as Commander, Third Fleet, based at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on promotion to vice admiral. He was responsible for controlling the response to Soviet Navy submarines detected using the underwater SOSUS monitoring system, and for training units assigned often enroute to Seventh Fleet operations. This included Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises involving the navies of other nations. His staff developed and he instituted the Composite Warfare Coordinator (later Commander) concept. Op-03 role In 1975, Doyle returned to the Pentagon as Op-03, for what became a five year tenure, directing the development of plans and programs for all surface ships except aircraft carriers. During this time, USS Ticonderoga (DDG-47) (later CG-47), featuring the first AEGIS radar and fire control system, was authorized in the 1977 budget, in light of a lack of political will to fund nuclear powered cruisers and destroyers. Doyle‚Äôs experience with nuclear operations meant that his suggestion for a systems approach to manning and training enabled the crew to be trained on the system as it was built, then commissioned by the crew rather than dockyard staff. This substantially shortened the time between the ship‚Äôs commissioning and operational readiness. It is arguably this approach that earned Doyle recognition when the shore-based AEGIS system development centre, USS Rancocas in Moorestown, New Jersey, commissioned by Doyle and RADM Wayne E. Meyer (the ‚Äúfather of AEGIS‚Äù) in 1977, was renamed the ‚ÄúVice Admiral James H. Doyle, Jr. Combat System Engineering Development Site‚Äù (CSEDS) in May 2008. Doyle‚Äôs tenure also saw the requirements settled for the multi-mission Arleigh Burke- class destroyer, Whidbey Island-class dock landing ship, and Cimarron-class fleet replenishment oiler. Additionally, the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) ASW helicopter development, that became the SH-60B, was initiated by Op-03. Doyle‚Äôs wife, Jeanette, was the ‚Äúlaunching lady‚Äù for USS Cimarron (AO-177) in 1981. Doyle retired from the US Navy on 1 September 1980. At his retirement ceremony, he was honored with the award of a second Distinguished Service Medal for service as Deputy CNO, Surface Warfare. Post-Navy The Doyles retired to their home in Bethesda, Maryland, that they had owned since 1971. Doyle created a family corporation, JHD Inc., that allowed him to become a consultant to industry. That included RCA Missile and Surface Radar Systems, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, General Dynamics, Martin Marietta, Presearch, Burdeshaw, Kaman, General Physics, Bath Iron Works, Vought, and Brunswick and Diagnostic Retrieval Systems. Personal Doyle and his wife Jeanette had three children, Kathleen, James III, and Anne. Legacy The Naval War College established the ‚ÄúVice Admiral James H. Doyle, Jr., Military Operations and International Law Prizes‚Äù.

Tietchens recorded the album at Audiplex Studios with producer and mentor Okko Bekker, who is credited as Rokko Ekbek. Departing from the musical style of the musician's debut album Nachtstucke (1980), Biotop contains sixteen short electronic pop tracks that are characterised by their immediate nature but unusual synth lines, tones and melodies. Bekker compared the music to radio time signals. Indeed, the liner notes state the album was performed by Das Zeitzeichenorchester, which translates to The Time-Signal Orchestra, although in reality this is an alias for Tietchens, the album's only performer. The first of four albums Tietchens recorded for Sky Records, Biotop was released to general acclaim, although it sat in obscurity. It was remastered and re-released on CD with bonus material via Die Stadt in 2003, bringing it renewed critical attention, and again via Bureau B in 2013. Retrospective critics have posed the album as a predecessor to the IDM and electropop styles. Background and production Asmus Tietchens in Sydney, 2009. Asmus Tietchens began making experimental electronic music in 1965, and several years later purchased a MiniMoog. Nonetheless, he did not issue an album until Nachtst√ºcke (1980), produced by Peter Baumann of Tangerine Dream and released on French label Egg Records, although the musician had recorded a tape music album with Okko Bekker and Hans Dieter Wohlmann in the mid-late 1960s entitled Adventures in Sound, which remained unreleased until published in a double album set with Nachtstucke. Biotop was the musician's second official album. His intention for the album was to write tracks with no bass lines, in order to \\"erase any commercial potential the record might have.\\" Okko Bekker (under the pseudonym Rokko Ekbek) produced the album, which was recorded at Audiplex Studios, where it was also mixed by Bekker. In the liner notes, Tietchens jokes that the album was recorded with his backing band Das Zeitzeichenorchester (roughly translated as \\"The Time-Signal Orchestra\\"). The names of the musicians in the imagined band are anagrams of the musician's own name, including Stu 'The Cute' Sins. Among the electronic equipment used by Tietchens on the album are a ring modulator, flanger and harmonizer. Composition Biotop is a quirky electronic album dominated by usage of the CompuRhythm drum machine and synthesizers. The tracks are short, and most run for under three minutes, but Tietchens' \\"warped sense\\" of melody, wherein synth lines and notes slip out of tune and \\"out of control,\\" stops the music from being simple. Brainwashed wrote that each of the tracks on the \\"quirky pop\\" album is a \\"rich, two-minute exercise in Tietchens' inimitable melodic style, filtered through vintage synths and drum machines.\\" Writer Dominique Leone commented on Tietchens' \\"mastery of highbrow composition guised in synth-pop's veneer\\" and described the album's tracks as loopy √©tudes which take the form of \\"short, immediately distinctive electro-snap jingles.\\" Tietchens' mentor Okko Bekker compared the music's \\"sparse and concise nature\\" to radio time signals. Although most of the music is light in tone, this style is offset by several unsettling explorations into ambient music, such as \\"Miss Ann Trope\\" and the title track. Indeed, the album has been described as having a detached, claustrophobic feel. \\"Blutmund\\" features dirty synth tones and queasy harmonies. According to Leone, \\"Modern Arroganz\\" takes synth-pop to its \\"logical endpoint\\" by incorporating staccato snares and \\"uptempo robo-funk\\" overlaid with minimal hits of the Moog synthesiser alongside computerised vocals. With its bossa nova-influenced sound and glacial synths, \\"Tr√ºmmerk√∂pfe\\" features exotica- styled sound effects in a style similar to Juan Garc√≠a Esquivel and a cha-cha beat. Although the track's plonky lead melody is mostly a synth line, a jarring interval briefly occurs when it jumps \\"a 6th and a bit,\\" a contrast from the tonality that characterises the rest of the piece. Throughout its three minutes, \\"Sekundentanz\\" poses an electronic take on spectralism, with a droning cluster working through intensely different tones. The title track is among the more experimental tracks, opening with a singular note which expands to incorporate overtones from a variety of synthesizer technology that Leone recons \\"most musicians probably haven't even explored now, much less in 1981.\\" As the increasing amount of fuzzy ambient layers obscure the original tone, the sounds suddenly recede. Release and reception Biotop was released by Sky Records in 1981 as the label's 57th album release. The album cover was credited to \\"Tina Tuschemess\\". Stylistically consistent with other Tietchens albums like Litia (1983), the artwork for Biotop features no photographs of Tietchen. In a contemporary review for German magazine Pardon, Venske Henning recommended Biotop and felt that \\"Tietchens produces for himself and for people with imagination.\\" He felt the album would be suited for Pink Floyd fans and listeners who felt the boundaries of \\"electronic sounds and noises\\" had yet to be furthered. Having been long unavailable on CD, Biotop was remastered and released on the format in 2003 by the Die Stadt label as the second in a series of 18 CDs covering Tietchen's early material. This version adds two previously unreleased bonus tracks entitled \\"Futurum Drei\\" and \\"Fast Food\\". On 20 August 2013, the album was re-released as a 180 gram vinyl by record label Bureau B. Among retrospective reviews, Fran√ßois Couture of AllMusic felt that Biotop was a \\"big leap\\" from Tietchens' debut album. He felt the musician's \\"unpredictability\\" had kept the album \\"fresh\\" over time despite the aged technology it uses, writing that \\"[y]ou simply cannot tell where these short tunes (nothing over four minutes, most under three) will go, even if they appear to be simple, even simplistic.\\" Dominique Leone of Pitchfork cited Biotop as his favourite Tietchens album and recommended it for fans of \\"futuristic pop\\" bands Kraftwerk and Cluster. He wrote that the album was a \\"delight\\" from the most \\"consistently enjoyable\\" period of Tietchen's career, and hoped it would turn him into a household name among \\"houses that already hold modern-day groups like Mouse on Mars, Kammerflimmer Kollektief and even The Notwist in high esteem.\\" In their review, Brainwashed felt that Biotop ventured further into \\"the quirky pop idiom\\" only hinted at with Tietchen's debut album, commenting that it \\"[weaves] heady, claustrophobic atmospherics in and out of each robotic beat and dated synth whirl.\\" They praised how the album \\"keeps a bizarre, grainy distance\\" even during its most bouncy moments, \\"invoking the kind of antique futurism groups like Trans Am wish they had it in them to create,\\" and although they felt the personality of Tietchens' later works was absent, the album is nonetheless \\"a fascinating, elusive little creation, valuable apart from its status as a document of the brilliant musician's formative years.\\" Kev Nickells of Freq reviewed the record alongside its Sky Records follow-up Sp√§t-Europa (1982); he felt both albums were \\"historically important\\" and \\"an important snapshot of a time in synths\\" which remain engaging on their own terms. He considered Biotop to have an unusual sound, highlighting the \\"perpetual sense that minor keys can sound a lot more unpleasant when the body of the note is missing a few critical overtones or has some filter/envelope on it that makes the square waves entirely revolting.\\" Legacy Biographer John Bush of AllMusic cites Biotop as the first in a period of \\"surprisingly accessible electronic pop\\" albums by Tietchens that continued for three further albums ‚Äì Sp√§t-Europa, In die Nacht and Litia ‚Äì also released on the Sky Records label. In a 1995 interview, Tietchens said: \\"The four Sky albums were a brief period, a short trip into the fields of electronic pseudo-pop. I never did such things before.\\" In a 2005 Pitchfork article, Leone wrote that Biotop highlighted Tietchen's often- overlooked role in the development of electronic pop, saying that although the album's \\"discordant textures and off-kilter beats\\" were characteristic of the composer, the music's do-it-yourself ethos belied his reputation as a \\"serious\\" composer. Leone also commented that Biotop was crucial to the development of IDM, while Couture commented that the album predicted the electropop of 2000s acts like Felix Kubin and Reznicek. \\"Blutmund\\" was reportedly an influence on The Fall's song \\"I Am Damo Suzuki,\\" from the group's acclaimed album This Nation's Saving Grace (1985). In 2018, musician Helena Hauff named Biotop as one of her thirteen favourite albums in a list for The Quietus. She said: \\"It's so ahead of its time, and it still sounds so fresh and modern and not in any way dated. It still sounds like the vision of the future.\\" She felt the \\"versatile\\" album had \\"so many ideas and feelings\\" that were suitable for a variety of her DJ mixes, and commented that \\"all the ideas are not totally thought through, which is a good quality. It's kind of open, you can kind of finish the idea.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Asmus Tietchens.

The lead is Colin Snodgrass, from The Open University in UK. Castalia was proposed in 2015 and 2016 to the European Space Agency within the Cosmic Vision programme missions M4 and M5, but it was not selected. Because of the construction time required and orbital dynamics, a launch date of October 2028 is proposed. Overview Main-belt comets (MBCs) are a recently discovered population of apparently icy bodies within the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which may represent the remnants of the population which supplied the early Earth with water.The Castalia mission to Main Belt Comet 133P/Elst-Pizarro. C. Snodgrass, G. H. Jones, H. Boehnhardt, A. Gibbings, etal. Advances in Space Research, Volume 62, Issue 8, 15 October 2018, Pages 1947-1976. . The Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko in 2014, indicates that Jupiter family comets cannot be the main source of Earth's water as previously thought. Castalia would rendezvous and orbit comet 7968 Elst‚ÄìPizarro and measure isotope ratios, plasma and dust properties, while also mapping its interior structure with a radar. Basically, Castalia would test whether MBCs are a viable source for Earth's water, and to use MBCs as tracers of the formation and evolution of the Solar System.Castalia: A Mission to a Main Belt Comet. Castalia home page. Accessed: October 2018. The primary propulsion would be solar electric with supporting chemical propulsion.Castalia - The Spacecraft. Castalia home page. Accessed: October 2018. The spacecraft would orbit comet Pizarro from a distance of 20 km, and it would also perform a few close approaches and 'hover' for a total of 100 hours as close as 5 km from the surface to make additional observations and collect the necessary sampling of dust and gas. The mission architecture and spacecraft design were initially developed in 2013 by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen and OHB SE. Castalia was proposed, in slightly different versions, to the European Space Agency M4 (2015), and M5 (2016) missions within the Cosmic Vision programme. Although it was not selected, the team continues to mature the mission concept and science goals. The mission concept is named after Castalia, a nymph in Greek mythology that was turned into a fountain by a god, and she could inspire the genius of poetry to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound. Science goals The main science goals of the mission are: *Characterise a main belt comet (MBC), by in situ investigation *Understand the physics of MBC activity *Directly detect water in the asteroid belt *Test whether MBCs are a viable source for Earth's water *Use MBCs as tracers of planetary system formation and evolution. Science payload The conceptual science payload includes the following instruments: *MBCCAM, vis/near-IR imager *TMC, thermal IR imager *SOURCE, deep radar *SSR, shallow radar *CAMS, mass spectrometer *DIDIMA, combined dust detector and composition *MAG, magnetometer *ChAPS, plasma package The mission would also include a radio science experiment using the spacecraft's communication system.

Most of his research was conducted through experimental trials to understand ecosystem processes in terrestrial and tropical environments. The results of the research provided the ability to further comprehend forest structure and management, as well as its nutrient dynamics. The primary research conducted dealt with the beginning stages of the regrowth and recovery following agriculture practices. Ewel also participated in studies regarding invasive species and restoration ecology.  Schooling and early career  As an undergraduate, Ewel studied forestry in SUNY Syracuse in the College of Environmental Science and Forestry (located in New York). He focused on the biology and management of natural resources and the environment, and after graduation in 1962, he attended a graduate summer program in Puerto Rico. He remained in Puerto Rice to work for the U.S. Forest Service Institute of Tropical Forestry to examine the effects of irradiation on a tropical forest. In 1963, Joe Tosi hired Ewel to work in an ecological mapping of Venezuela. After three years, Ewel returned to the United States and completed his M.S degree with Hugh Popenoe at the University of Florida, focusing on litter decay in Guatemalan second-growth vegetation. His Ph.D was completed by working under Howard T. Odum to study the succession in three sites in Costa Rica and two sites in Puerto Rico.  Career  In 1971, University of Florida hired Ewel. While he was working in UF, he was also active in the formation of Corcovado National Park in Costa Rica from 1974 to 1975. In 1990, Ewel became the President of ATB, serving on the Board of Directors and advising for multiple committees at the Organization for Tropical Studies. In 1994, he retired from the University of Florida and became director of the U.S. Forest Service‚Äôs Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, r. d responsible for research as well as outreach programs in American Samoa, Commonwealth of Northern Marines, Guam, Hawaii, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. In 2005, he retired from U.S. Forest Service, and in 2015 became an Honorary Fellow at the Association of Tropical Biology and Conservation. Present day, he resides with his wife Katherine Ewel in Gainesville, Florida as an Emeritus Professor at the University of Florida and still publishes occasionally.  Research   Tropical Succession  Ewel's research was conducted on successional landscapes by examining the regrowth and recovery following agriculture practices in Guatemala, Sarawak, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. He examined the succession in its natural occurrence as well as in some cases were human-induced second growth by burning the forest to represent a farmer clearing a field for crop production. Other research he had conducted had examined the tropical succession using the gradients of temperature and moisture to gather more data for further analysis.  Biodiversity and Longevity of Plants  Ewel and his fellow researchers, conducted two experiments in Costa Rica, at Centro Agron√≥mico Tropical de Investigaci√≥n y Ense√±anza, The variables of the experiments were to investigate the plant's productivity, their nutrient loss, and interactions with other species of plants, competitors, as well as their consumers. Examined the plant's resistance to pesticides as well as soil fertility after erosion of harvesting annual crops.  Novel Ecosystems  In the 1970s, Ewel and his colleges chose certain aquatic habitats that either possed a nutrient-rich (heavily polluted) environment or a nutrient-poor environment. The researchers added little clusters of water hyacinth to each environment. The results showed that the heavily nutrient-rich aquatic environment had extremely abundant and heavily dense water hyacinths compared to the water hyacinths growing in the nutrient-poor aquatic environment, thus showing human activities alter the fundamental stability of that ecosystem. Since then, more research was conducted to understand changes due to land use by humans and develop new methods to manage the ecosystems in a more sustainable manner.  Publications  Books Myers, R.

Grimm is an American ecosystem ecologist and professor at Arizona State University. Grimm's substantial contributions to the understanding urban and arid ecosystem biogeochemistry are recognized in her numerous awards. Grimm is an elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, Ecological Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Grimm had no interest in pursuing a career or major in STEM, but rather something to do with foreign language. However, after her first class in ecology at Hampshire College she decided that she wanted to be an ecologist. Nancy received her Bachelor's degree in 1978 from Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Grimm earned her M.S. in 1980 and Ph.D. in 1985 from Arizona State University. Grimm acknowledges key mentors throughout her life: Stan Gregory for inspiration as an undergraduate student at Hampshire College, Steve Carpenter for providing access to new opportunities, and Jim Collins for his advice once she got to Arizona State.  Research and career  Grimm has been a professor for the School of Life Sciences and a Senior Sustainability scientist at Arizona State University since 1990. She was the director of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program for nearly two decades (1997-2016), which focuses on studying the social-ecological system of the metropolitan area of Phoenix. Currently, she directs a sustainability research network that looks into how urban areas respond to extreme weather events. Grimm and her research group primarily focus on urban and stream ecosystems, examining the effects of climate variation and change on ecosystem function. The success of Grimm's research program is evident in the more than $25 million in research funds she has secured from the National Science Foundation. This funding has allowed Grimm to carry out research that has enhanced the understanding of how ecosystems function in light of disturbance - whether that is the chronic disturbance of urbanization or how the variability of flow in a semi-arid streams and how these shifts affect the cycling of critical elements (e.g. nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus). Grimm is the former president of the Ecological Society of America (2005-2006) and the North American Benthological Society (1999-2000, now Society for Freshwater Science). In addition to her position at Arizona State, Grimm has worked as a program director for the National Science Foundation and has worked with the U.S. Global Change Research Program as a senior scientist. Grimm worked alongside 300 other scientific experts to write the National Climate Assessment in 2014. The National Climate Assessment is a publication which is referred to by the public, federal agencies, and the National Academy of Sciences to learn about the changes that have already occurred as a result of climate change as well as what is expected as a result of climate change in the future. Grimm worked as the director of Arizona State University's Undergraduate Mentorship in Environmental Biology program between 1993 and 1998 in an effort to increase the number of students in underrepresented groups interested in ecology. During her time at Arizona State University, she has been the mentor of 42 graduate scholars, 29 post-doctoral scholars, and 41 undergraduate research scholars.  Awards and recognition  Nancy received the Arizona State University Faculty Achievement Award for her research in 2010. She received this award because of her research about urban ecology and studies which focus on the clash between human interaction and the environmental response. *Distinguished Ecologist, Colorado State University Graduate Program in Ecology, 2004 * Distinguished Ecologist, Utah State University Ecology Program, January 2003 *Founders‚Äô Day Faculty Award for Excellence in Research, Arizona State University Alumni Association, 2010 * Inaugural Minshall Lecturer, Idaho State University, 2007 *Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2008 *Distinguished Scientist Award, American Institute of Biological Sciences, 2011 *Director‚Äôs Award for Collaborative Integration, National Science Foundation, 2012 *Fellow, Ecological Society of America, 2012 * Eminent Ecologist, Kellogg Biological Station, June 2015 * Inaugural William Mitsch Lecturer, University of Notre Dame, October 2015 *Distinguished Ecologist, Marine Biological Laboratory Ecosystems Center, October 2015 * Jenner Lecturer, University of North Carolina, April 2015 * Eugene and Bill Odum Lecturer, University of Georgia, April 2015 * Fellow, American Geophysical Union, 2017 *Member, National Academy of Sciences, 2019  Publications  Nancy Grimm has published over 110 peer reviewed publications and has been cited thousands of times.

Early life and education  Templer was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. She attended Grover Cleveland Humanities Magnet High School. In college, she was a music major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Templer soon realized that she did not want to pursue a career in music and when looking into other fields, spent a semester in a \\"Natural History of California\\" class, where she backpacked through California, while learning about ecosystem management. This class sparked her interest in ecology and led her to spend the summer class at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (New York), where she learned how to conduct research. She later went to Costa Rica for a semester to study tropical biology, this helped her narrow-down her field of study. Templer went on to earn her PhD from Cornell University under the direction of Todd Dawson (currently a professor at University of California Berkeley).  Career and research  Templer is an ecosystem ecologist and full professor of Biology at Boston University, who examines the influence that plant-microbial interactions have on nutrient cycling. Templer and her lab group also investigate how ecosystem disturbance such as, urbanization, air pollution, climate change, have on biosphere-atmosphere-soil interactions. Templer currently examines a variety of nutrient sources such as fog, rain, and atmospheric deposition within forest ecosystems, she also study plant- microbial interactions and their effect on carbon and nitrogen loss and retention within natural and managed ecosystems. Templer and her lab work around the world, investigating different disturbances on terrestrial ecosystems in different places. These include: temperate forest in the northeast of the United States, tropical forests in Mexico, and urban areas throughout the Greater Boston Area. Much of Templer's work investigating how forests are and will respond to warming and other chronic disturbances takes place at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a long term ecological research site in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Templer specifically looks at a changing climate in the White Mountains and tries create conditions that the forest may experience within the next century by heating the soil using space heaters and clearing off snow. Under warming conditions there is less snow so soils actually get colder (snow acts as a blanket for soils, insulating them in the winter), leading to freezing of the soil microbe community and changing the way carbon and nutrients are cycled in the forest floor. For example, along with Anne Socci, she found that a smaller snowpack leads to greater soil frost, reducing nitrogen uptake rates in sugar maple trees. Templer also examines how reactive nitrogen in atmospheric deposition varies spatially across forest ecosystems in the northeast with colleague Kathleen Weathers In addition to her terrestrial biogeochemistry lab, Templer also co-directs the Stable Isotope Lab at Boston University. This fee-for-hire lab also serves to train students in application of stable isotopes to ecology. The stable isotope lab measures on light isotopes, including nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Stable isotopes of these critical elements can help scientists unravel the multiple ecosystem processes that always occur in concert. For example, stable isotopes can be used to determine food web structure and metabolic pathways or determine sources of an element to any given pool (such as different sources of reactive nitrogen). Templer has written or contributed to over 130 peer-reviewed articles and cited over 4700 times . Her most cited work utilizes stable isotopes (in particular nitrogen) to examine how ecosystems respond to changing climate and other human disturbances.  Teaching and outreach  Templer teaches classes in the Department of Biology at Boston University across a range of topics, including Ecology, Biology of Global Change, Forest Ecology, and Terrestrial Biogeosciences. Templer was praised as a \\"champion of participatory learning,\\" by often exposing her students to field research when awarded the Metcalf Award from Boston University in 2015. Templer is the Director of the Ph.D. Program in Biogeoscience, Director of the NSF funded Research Traineeship BU URBAN Graduate Program. Templer has appeared on multiple media outlets discussing her research specifically as well as ecosystems and climate change in general from Scientific American and the Boston Globe to appearing on WBUR's morning edition.http://www.bu.edu/av/news/wbur-02-27-treestudy.mp3  Awards and honors  *Metcalf Award from Boston University in 2015.

Kollam.nic.in. Retrieved on 2014-07-11. It is located on the west of the Main Central Road. The closest towns are Anchal and Punalur. The village is also close to Kadakkal, an agricultural village known for its spice production and the Kadakkal Devi Temple.http://kadakkalamma.org/about/ Thiruvananthapuram, formerly Trivandrum, is from Mannoor and is the closest airporthttps://www.keralatourism.org/routes-locations/mannur--i-/id/9642. Kollam, formerly Quilon, the district headquarters, is away. History The original inhabitants of the village were indigenous people belonging to the Vedan and other scheduled tribes. They were displaced to the nearby fringes of forests as new immigrants started settling in the village. Early inhabitants By late 19th century, the \\"Mannoor\\" family of Nairs migrated from the northern areas of Travancore along with a few Syrian Christian families that arrived in Mannoor from the northern parts of Travancore. It was a time of large scale migration of Syrian Christians of Travancore and the Kingdom of Cochin. Some of the first Syrian Christian families who came to Mannoor were Keezhathil , Cherukkattu, Thadathil, Idayilaveettil and Keezhoottu. Their arrival in Mannoor almost coincided with the Malabar Migration which saw large-scale migration of Syrian Christians to North Malabar. Geography Mannoor is a hilly terrain lying on the far-end of the foothills of the Western Ghats. The village has a rich biodiversity. Crows, pigeons, cranes, lapwings and common myna are some of the common birds seen in the area. Peacocks and foxes rarely stray away from forest to the village. Agriculture Cashew was once the largest cash crops in the village, and there were several small-stretch plantations. All these plantations were gradually replaced by rubber plantations after the 1960s. Rubber is today the most widely prevalent cash crop in Mannoor, which has led to decrease in the area under cultivation of essential food crops. Pezhu, vatta, mango and jackfruit are some of the naturally grown flora in the area. Agricultural crops include rice, coconut and arecanut. Villages cultivate a variety of plants such as tapioca, elephant yam, colocasia and Guyana arrowroot, though the area under cultivation has drastically decreased. Plantain is the one of the most cultivated crops in the region and there are a number of varieties. Black pepper is also grown.  Environment  A tributary of Ithikkara River flows through Mannoor, dividing the village into two.https://www.deccanchronicle.com/141111/nation-current- affairs/article/ithikkara-river-verge-%E2%80%98imminent%E2%80%99-death Mannoor has a number of paddy fields. They are: * Cherukkattu Mele (Near Unnikkunnumpuram) * Vellaramkunnu - Meenkulam * Puthar * Mannoor Veedu - Keezhathil Veedu Stretch * Perumkulath Ela * Vazhangottu Ela * Kovoor Rice cultivation was once the mainstay of the economy of Mannoor along with coconut and Areca nut. The paddy fields and streams running beside them are a pivotal element of the ecology of the village. Politics The village is traditionally a stronghold of the Congress Party. The Party gained strength in the village in the wake of the struggle for independence from British colonial rule in India. The villagers at large, however, did not take active part in the independence struggle and still keep aloof from the people's struggles that take place elsewhere in the state reflecting very low political consciousness. It was only in the 1990s that the Communist Parties could gain support in Mannoor. For the past 25 years or so, the Communist Party of India has made some inroads into Mannoor. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) also has nominal presence in the village today. Kerala Congress (M) is another political party with active presence in Mannoor. Other major political parties are also virtually absent. Despite the presence of secular political parties, the public life of the village has resisted secularisation. Public life still revolves around places of worship in the predominantly Christian village. Institutions Mannoor has several institutions serving the public. LMS Lower Primary School, founded by the London Missionary Society, is one of the oldest institutions in the village. There is a Taluk Co-operative Hospital in Mannoor but it is struggling for survival as villagers prefer to go to hospitals in Anchal, a nearby town, for medical treatment. Integrated Cattle Development Project (ICDP) of the State government has a unit in Mannoor, catering to the needs of veterinary medicine for livestock. Co-operative Milk Society and Sahrudaya Arts and Sports Club are the other institutions in the village. A post office was established in 1980s before which neighbouring Vayala used to serve Mannoor. There was a small-scale khadi spinning unit but it became defunct long ago.  Religion  Christianity and Hinduism are the most prevalent religions in the village. The new Syrian Christian settlers in late 19th century mostly belonged to the Oriental Orthodox faith. They established the St. Mary's Orthodox Church, also known as Cherukkattu Palli, on a land donated by the Keezhathil family. A few prominent families including Cherukkattu Veedu, Thadathil (Panayil Puthen Veedu) and Idayila Veedu also contributed in building the Church. When the Orthodox Church underwent a split in 1912, the congregation sided with the Indian Orthodox Church.https://scroll.in/article/858273/a-century-old-church-dispute-in- kerala-flares-up-again-as-supreme-court-rejects-plea-on-leadership The other faction, Jacobite Syrian Church has no representation in the entire vicinity till today. The next denominations to start places of worship were Mar Thoma Church and Brethren. Then came the Malankara Catholic Church and Ceylon Pentecostal Mission. The Pentecostal faith was introduced to the village by two women. The second church to come up in Mannoor was Salem Marthoma Church and the Brethren Church which was established in Keezhathil household by two men of other families as a result of evangelism by John Vilangara. The present St. George Malankara Catholic Church was established soon after. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) has its presence in Mannoor. The major Hindu temples of worship are located around Mannoor. Athyshyamangalam Devi Temple and Kuthirapanthi Devi Temple are few of the more prominent of them. Arts and science Mannoor is one of the very few villages in Kerala where people's science movements such as Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad are conspicuous by its total absence. There is no organization or activity aimed at promoting scientific temper in society in Mannoor. Activities in the fields of liberal arts and literature are also on the ebb in the otherwise economically advanced village. Climate Mannoor experiences a tropical climate with little seasonal variation in temperatures. December-March is the dry season with less than 65mm of rain in each of those months. April-November is the wet season, with considerably more rain than during December-March.

After his father, Robert the Leper, was executed by the atabeg (or governor) of Toghtekin in 1119, William inherited Balatanos and Saone. Zardana, that his father had lost before his death, was restored to William by Baldwin II of Jerusalem in 1121. He supported Baldwin II's daughter, Alice, against her brother-in-law, Fulk of Jerusalem, in 1132, but Fulk defeated her allies. William died fighting either against Fulk's troops or against a Muslim army.  Family  William was the son of Robert the Leper, who held important fiefs in the Principality of Antioch. Two of Robert's three castlesSaone and Balatanoswere located near Latakia, the third, Zardana, to the east of the Orontes River. Zardana was taken by Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus, in 1119. Robert was captured during the siege and Toghtekin had him executed. William and his brother, Garenton, inherited their father's domains. Saone was strengthened during either his or his father's tenure.  Antiochene baron  Ruins of the fortress of Saone King Baldwin II of Jerusalem ruled Antioch on behalf of the minor prince, Bohemond II, from 1119. Historian Thomas Asbridge says, William may have been one of the barons who persuaded the king to pursue an aggressive policy against the Muslims of Aleppo. Indeed, the 13th-century historian, Ibn al-Adim, mentioned that Baldwin II laid siege to Zardana \\"for William\\" in 1121. Zardana surrendered to Baldwin who restored the fortress to William. A year later, the Artuqid rulers, Ilghazi and Balak, jointly attacked Zardana. William defended the fortress for fifteen days before he surrendered it, but he soon routed Ilghazi at Harbal. Due to his proximity to Aleppo, Zardana was one of the strategically most important fortresses in the principality. Bohemond II assumed the government of Antioch in 1126, but died four years later. His widow, Alice, wanted to secure the rule of Antioch for herself against her brother-in-law, Fulk of Jerusalem, in 1132. William and his brother supported her, but Fulk defeated her allies and appointed Rainald I Masoir to administer the principality. William died during either this conflict or a Muslim attack against Zardana. His widow, Beatrice, married Joscelin III of Courtenay.

He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1990 after being nominated twice during the war years but rejected because of his Crimean Tatar nationality. Early life Abilov was born in 1915 to a Crimean Tatar peasant family in the village of Dzhadra-Sheikh-Eli on the Crimean peninsula, then part of the Russian Empire. After completing seven grades of school he worked in metallurgy and as a tractor driver on a state-owned farm until entering the Red Army in 1937. In 1939 he completed infantry school in Tbilisi, and in 1942 he became a member of the Communist party. World War II Abilov was sent to the front lines of World War II in July 1941 while holding the rank of captain as the deputy commander of a rifle battalion, immediately after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In September 1942 he was appointed as commander of the 1292nd Rifle Regiment, and remained its commander until 8 June 1943. That year he completed accelerated courses at the M. V. Frunze Military Academy, after which he was assigned as commander of the 130th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 44th Guards Rifle Division. Under his command the regiment broke through enemy defenses on the Narew River and went on to hold a bridgehead from which they inflicted a high degree of damage against enemy forces; killed an estimated 600 enemy soldiers and captured 150 enemy horses in Baranavichy on 8 July 1944; pursued retreating German troops across Eastern and Central Europe, taking enemy equipment in the process; expelled Axis forces from more than 70 settlements in offensive with two other regiments from the division; and broke through heavily fortified areas covered by minefields and trenches. He was wounded in battle three times but survived the war, and he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union twice during the war (in 1944 and in 1945) but was not awarded it at the time. Later life In 1947 he was demobilized from active duty and discharged into the reserve. Unlike most Crimean Tatar veterans of the war, Abilov was not deported to Central Asia, as he was living under the Russian name of Anatoly. In 1964 he became the chief of staff and deputy director at the experiment engineering and civil defense plant of Zhukovsky. He was a member of the presidium of the council of veterans, and on 5 May 1990 he was belatedly declared a Hero of the Soviet Union.

He has published over 150 scientific papers in these areas, and contributed to more than 500 presentations at international conferences. He is a chaired professor in Atmospheric Sciences at Lule√• Tekniska Universitet (LTU), Sweden, and Senior Research Scientist of the Spanish Research Council, assigned to the Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra, located in Armilla, Granada, Spain. He is also a visiting professor at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, and a Specially Appointed Professor at Okayama University. Previously he has worked for ESA, the California Institute of Technology, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, and 10 years for NASA at the Langley Research Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Mars research Martin-Torres is the principal investigator of the HABIT (HabitAbility: Brine, Irradiation and Temperature) instrument, which will travel to Mars as part of the scientific payload of the ExoMars 2020 mission to investigate, amongst other things, the water exchange cycle between the atmosphere and the Martian regolith. Martin-Torres is also a Co-I on the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity rover, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ACS instrument, and ISEM/ExoMars rover. He has been the scientist responsible for the REMS instrument in NASA's Curiosity rover, which since 2012 investigates the habitability of Mars, and co-investigator of 5 space missions of NASA and ESA. Martin-Torres is co-author of the latest reported discoveries about Martian environment, namely, the presence of fixed nitrogen, native organics in Martian ground, the detection of methane plumes in the atmosphere and, remarkably, the daily formation of liquid aqueous solutions on the soil (Transient liquid water and water activity at Gale crater on MarsMartin- Torres, J., Zorzano, M-P., Valentin-Serrano, P., Harri, A-M., Genzer, M., Kemppainen, O., Rivera-Valentin, E.

T., 2015, Transient liquid water and water activity at Gale crater on Mars, Nature Geoscience, vol. 8, p. 357-361, doi:10.1038/ngeo2412.). Transient liquid water on Mars The article Transient liquid water and water activity at Gale crater on Mars, reported the existence of a daily cycle of water exchange between the atmospheric boundary layer and the ground, including a phase during which the water remains in a transient liquid state. This is possible thanks to the presence in the soil of perchlorates, a highly hygroscopic kind of chlorine salts which seem to be ubiquitous over the Martian surface. These salts have the capability of catching water vapour from the environment up to the point of becoming solved in it forming concentrated solutions or brines. It is an extreme case of hygroscopy known as deliquescence. The eutectic temperature of these brines allows its permanence in liquid state under the registered Martian environmental conditions in the study area of Curiosity, close to the equator, where they are the least favourable for this to happen. Therefore, it is expected that the phenomenon is more intense in terms of duration of the liquid phase in higher latitudes. The presence of liquid water on present day Mars entails transcendent consequences in a number of aspects of the planet's exploration. Firstly, it casts a new light on the comprehension of Martian environment, and can be the key to understand some morphological features of the surface, such as the so-called Recurrent Slope Lineae (RSLs). In addition, the discovery has posed the necessity for taking special precautions to avoid biological contamination of the planet with terrestrial organisms carried on board the spacecrafts to be sent in the next missions, since the availability of liquid water multiply the possibilities for them to survive and thrive in certain places. Finally, water can be a valuable in-situ resource at the disposal of a crew which is eventually sent to Mars someday. However, the brines themselves have not been monitored yet, and a quantification of the phenomenon is still missing. This is what the Brine Observation Transition to Liquid Experiment (BOTTLE, one of the units composing HABIT instrument) is being developed for. Radiative Transfer modelling Martin-Torres has developed non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium models to explain the emissions of some of the main emitters in the infrared (ozone, methane, nitric oxide, hydroxyl, dinitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide); and has been part of the Science Team of MIPAS/Envisat, SABER/TIMED, and Orbiting Carbon Observatory. Martin-Torres is author of the line-by radiative transfer code FUTBOLIN (FUll Transfer By Optimized LINe by line), which is widely used to model radiative processes in the atmosphere. It has been used to model the Earth's atmosphere and the atmospheres like those of Mars, Venus, and Titan, and simulations of Earthshine for exoplanet applications. Selected publications *F.

Timeline   1798  The Congressional Act of 1798 was signed into law by President John Adams. It created a tax of 20 cents each month to be withheld from seamen's wages for support of marine hospitals. The money was paid to the U.S. Collector of Customs. This was the first example of pre-paid health insurance in U.S. history. The Act was expanded in 1799 to include all \\"officers, seamen and marines of the navy of the United States\\"  1801  In 1801, the first marine hospital owned by the Federal government was located at Washington Point in Virginia. Other early marine hospitals were established in the port cities of Boston, Massachusetts; Newport, Rhode Island; New Orleans, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Charleston, South Carolina. U.S. Marine Hospital, 800 St. Anthony Street, Mobile, Alabama. Built 1838-39.  1803  The first permanent Marine hospital was authorized to be built in Boston, Massachusetts.  1836  Kentucky Senator Henry Clay sponsored legislation for the U.S. Marine Hospital to be built in Louisville, \\"for the sick seamen, boatmen, and other navigators on the western rivers and lakes.\\"  1870  This practice continued until 1870, excepting one year from April 1837 to 1838. A bill was enacted to centralize and reorganize the Marine Hospital Service, with its headquarters in Washington, DC, under the position of supervising surgeon. This act also raised the hospital tax from 20 cents to 40 cents until 1884.  1871  John Maynard Woodworth John Maynard Woodworth, the first supervising surgeon, adopted a military model for his medical staff as part of system reform. Woodworth instituted examinations for applicants and implemented required uniforms for physicians. He created a cadre of mobile, career-service physicians assigned to various marine hospitals.  1878  The prevalence of major epidemic diseases such as smallpox and yellow fever across the globe spurred Congress to enact the National Quarantine Act to prevent the introduction and spread of contagious and infectious disease in the United States. The task of controlling epidemic diseases through quarantine and disinfection measures, as well as immunization programs, within the country fell to the Marine Hospital Service, such as these Public Health Service officers in uniform as the Montauk Point, New York Quarantine Station.  1879  The National Board of Health was created by the 15th U.S. Congress through an act that was titled, \\"An Act to prevent the Introduction of Infectious or Contagious Disease in the United States and to Establish a National Board of Health.\\" The board had 11 members 7 of which were appointed by the president, 3 were medical officers from the Navy, Marine Hospital Service and the Army, and the last member was a representative from the office of the Attorney General. The National Board of Health was responsible for conserving and improve public health. This was the first Federally organized effort for comprehensive medical research. They were also given the power to quarantine.  1887  A one-room bacteriological laboratory was created within the Marine Hospital Service in Staten Island, New York by Dr. Joseph Kinyoun. It was known as the Laboratory of Hygiene. It was established to conduct research on cholera and several other infectious diseases. It was later redesignated as the National Institute of Health [sic] in 1930.  1889  An Act of Congress established the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and formalized the Commissioned Corps as the uniformed services component of the Marine Hospital Service. Congress organized Corps officers along military lines with titles and pay corresponding to Army and Navy grades.  1890  The Marine Hospital Service was given interstate quarantine powers by Congress. This was done as an effort to control the spread of epidemic diseases.  1902  The Marine Hospital Service expanded to the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service to reflect growing responsibilities. Officers continued to carry out quarantine duties, which now included the medical inspection of arriving immigrants, such as those landing at Ellis Island in New York. Public Health and Marine Hospital Service officers played a major role in fulfilling the commitment to prevent disease from entering the country.  1912  The name of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service was shortened to the Public Health Service (PHS). Legislation enacted by Congress broadened the powers of the PHS by authorizing investigations into human disease (such as tuberculosis, hookworm, malaria, and leprosy), sanitation, water supplies, and sewage disposal.  1936  Surgeon General Thomas Parran led the fight against venereal disease and paved the way for modern public health organizations. He strengthened and extended the research programs at the National Institutes of Health, established the Communicable Disease Center (later Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and participated in the planning of the World Health Organization.  1944  The PHS Act of 1944 broadened the scope of the Commissioned Corps, allowing for the commissioning of nurses, scientists, dietitians, physical therapists, and sanitarians (later health service officers). From 1940 to 1945, the Commissioned Corps quadrupled its numbers from 625 officers to 2,600.  1964  Surgeon General Dr. Luther Terry released a landmark report that concluded that lung cancer and chronic bronchitis are causally related to cigarette smoking. The report was the first such analysis that laid out the effects of tobacco and smoking and it spurred initiatives to lower tobacco use among Americans.  1986  C. Everett Koop Dr. C. Everett Koop served as Surgeon General as the nation began to recognize AIDS as a new and deadly disease. Koop became the chief Federal spokesperson on AIDS and released a report on AIDS that contributed significantly to providing information on the disease. Koop also wrote Understanding AIDS, the PHS brochure based on CDC guidelines that was sent to all 107 million households in the United States in 1988, the largest public health mailing ever at the time.  2005  More than 2,400 Commissioned Corps officers were deployed to the Gulf Region before, during, and after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. This is the largest deployment in numbers in Commissioned Corps history. The officers set up and staffed field hospitals and emergency medical clinics. treated sick and injured evacuees, conducted disease surveillance, and worked closely with local and State health authorities to plan for long-term public health needs.  2008  The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established the \\"DoD- USPHS Partnership for Psychological Health\\" initiative. Officers in the Commissioned Corps were detailed to military medical treatment facilities across the nation to ensure that service members and their families received the resources they needed by increasing the availability of behavioral health service providers. Today, the Commissioned Corps continues to fulfill its mission to protect, promote, and advance the health and safety of the nation under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary of Health and the U.S. Surgeon General. The Corps contributes to ground-breaking health initiatives, included the 2014 Surgeon General's Report that highlighted 50 years of progress in tobacco control and prevention, presented new data on the health consequences of tobacco use, and detailed initiatives that can end the tobacco epidemic in the United States. The Commissioned Corps' response to national health threats and other recent disasters underscores the value to our nation of having a highly trained, multidisciplinary, and quickly mobilized cadre of officers. The Marine Hospital Fund was a unique and early mechanism to provide the first publicly funded health care and disease prevention federal agency in the United States.

Early life  Hilda Gimpel was born on April 25, 1917, in Izbica Kujawska, then part of the Kingdom of Poland (1917‚Äì1918). She was the second of seven children. Her mother was a grain dealer and her father a baker. She later reflected that she had a \\"peaceful girlhood\\" and would often dance to Jewish music and go to the movies. In 1939, Eisen and her first husband, David, were taken from their neighborhood, which was invaded by German soldiers and imprisoned in the Lublin Ghetto. They were later transported by cattle wagons to labor camps. A German soldier helped Hilda to escape and join the Parczew partisans. Later, Eisen was recaptured by German forces and taken to a police station where she was interrogated. She counteracted and jumped from a second-story window, breaking her foot. During her escape, a German soldier showed Eisen compassion by shooting lower than the high fence she was scrambling to get over. After the war, Eisen learned that she had lost her parents and all five siblings to the Holocaust. Her husband, David, died as a member of the resistance fighters while searching for Hilda. Surviving for two winters, and forced to sleep on the ground, Eisen hoped a Russian officer would escort her to visit her husband's grave. Cursing her, the officer told Eisen her husband was \\"lucky\\" to have someone weep for him. No one would cry for her. The officer asked why it was \\"important to visit graves\\". Hilda realized the officer had a point; there was no time for crying. She simply said, \\"You're going to see what the next day will bring.\\" Eisen married another survivor, Harry Eisen. They moved to California and became millionaires with a large chicken egg distribution business. She died on November 22, 2017, and was survived by her daughters Ruth Eisen, Mary Cramer, and Francis Miller, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. A son, Howard, had died in 2014.  Career   Egg distribution business  Eisen sold eggs and raised chickens while her husband, Harry, also worked at a Vernon, California, hot dog factory cleaning meat barrels. The pair saved to purchase 100 chickens and started a business in Arcadia, California. In the 1950s, they moved their business operations to Norco, California. Their company was later named Norco Ranch Inc. The couple became multimillionaires and philanthropists after the company became the largest egg distributor west of the Rocky Mountains. They later sold the company to an agribusiness in Minnesota. At the time of the sale in 2000, the business had 450 employees and $100 million in annual sales.  Philanthropy  The Eisens were prominent members of the Norco community. They funded a group resisting an attempt by developers to have Norco incorporate in 1964. They later donated $10,000 to the city to help keep it operational. Eisen was known as a \\"constant voice for the remembrance of the atrocities of World War II.\\" She and her husband were contributors to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and were present at its dedication in 1993. She was a leader of the Lodzer Organization of Southern California, a group of Holocaust survivors who donate to Jewish charities in Israel and locally. In 2016, she donated an ambulance to Magen David Adom for her 99th birthday and in honor of her late husband.  Personal life  In 1945, Hilda married a former high school classmate, Harry Eisen, in Munich. In an interview, she said: \\"I'll tell you the truth: I got married out of fear, being scared to be alone in this world, no family, no friends ... He had the same feeling. He didn't love me, I didn't love him.\\" The couple lived for three years in refugee camps before sailing to New York City in May 1948 on the SS Marine Flasher. They had no money and spoke no English. They took a train to Los Angeles where one of Harry's cousins resided. They lived in Boyle Heights. In 1952, the family moved to Norco. They became naturalized citizens of the United States in 1953. Eisen was interviewed about her experiences in the Holocaust by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education on June 18, 2001. She died at the age of 100 on November 22, 2017, in Beverly Hills. She had three daughters and a son. Her son predeceased her. She was survived by three daughters, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. Eisen is interred at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

Los Diez were the pioneers for the Concrete movement or Concrete Abstraction, a style that defines itself as simply geometrical and without \\"...representational or drawn-from-life references... a style without narrative or natural connections...\\" Ballate, Henry. \\"D FINE: Artists and Exhibition in the Rodriguez Collection,\\" 3Concrete by Odette Artiles, Pg. 137-141, 2018, print.

However, the public and acclaimed art critics saw the work as ridiculous and foreign due to its assimilation of art movements from Latin America, Europe and its disregard for classic, academically taught, realistic techniques from the Vanguardists tradition. Although Los Diez exhibited as a group only three times, they comprised a significant period in Cuban political, social and artistic history in only three years. From the fall of Fulgencio Batista's regime to the Cuban Revolution and the rise of a very nationalistic sentiment, \\"Concretism\\" was all but omitted from Cuban art history until today with e Ora√°'s win of a National Prize for Visual Arts. \\"It seems to me that Pedro de Ora√° (1931) has always been there, reminding us through his work that a great piece is one that remains firmly on its path, indifferent to the ever-changing winds of fashion that blow.\\" Menendez, Aldo. \\"Across Time: Cuban Abstractions,\\" Exhibition catalog, Pg. 6, 2018, print.

Biography Marelli was born in Milan on May 19, 1867, the son of a craftsman from the Como area. At fifteen he began working as an apprentice at a mechanical workshop. In 1885 he was presented to Bartolomeo Cabella , director of the Italian Brown Boveri Tecnomasio and hired as a mechanic for measuring instruments and for electrical work applied to lighting. In October 1888 he went to Asunci√≥n in Paraguay, just twenty years old, where he assembled and operated an electrical system for the Concha Sociedad plant. Foundation of Ercole Marelli In 1891, when he returned to Italy, he founded a modest workshop of electrical appliances in the centre of Milan, assisted by a worker; they manufactured apparatus of physics and geodesy, electric machines for school toilets, batteries, accumulators and electro-medical devices. From 1898 it also began to trade AC motors. Sesto San Giovanni plant On 28 February 1900 it became a limited partnership. In December 1905 it opened a plant in Sesto San Giovanni, producing small electric motors, centrifugal pumps and transformers. Patents for magnetos In 1915, the \\"Societ√† Anonima Ercole Marelli\\" started the first Italian experiments in the field of magnetos for petrol engines. In 1916, Ercole Marelli registered the first patent related to magnetos, perfecting the innovation in 1917, and then again with a \\"complete\\" patent towards the end of 1918. Foundation of Magneti Marelli  In 1919 by Ercole Marelli he broke off a production department of automobile magnetos, which later became in turn the company Magneti Marelli. The joint venture established equal shares of capital, giving the presidency and the technical management, as well as the commercial one to Marelli. The ownership was then entrusted to the husband of his daughter, Bruno Antonio Quintavalle, who remained until 1967. In that year the entire stock package passed to Fiat and his brother Umberto Quintavalle. Archive The documentation produced by Ercole Marelli during his entrepreneurial activity is conserved in part at the ISEC Foundation [2] of Sesto San Giovanni , in the Ercole Marelli Fund (chronological details: 1896-1986) , and partly at the Magneti Marelli Historical Archives (chronological details: 1919-2000). The latter collects an extremely important documentary heritage for the history of industry in the fields of motor vehicles, telecommunications, radio and television, produced by the company in over ninety years of activity. The mission of the Historical Archive consists in collecting, conserving and enhancing the historical memory of Magneti Marelli and the brands that make it up, among which Weber and Solex , Veglia Borletti and Jaeger, Carello and Siem stand out. The preserved historical material covers an era that goes from the end of the 19th century to 2000 and is made up of a sector related to image and communication, with about 20,000 images, 500 films and over 2000 pieces among business magazines, brochures, advertisements and press reviews; a technical sector with over 1000 product catalogs, manuals and technical drawings; reports and company balance sheets.

The film was acquired by Freestyle Releasing, the digital division of Byron Allen Entertainment Studios, and released theatrically and via digital platforms on September 14, 2018. Plot When paramedics Dean and Eric get a 911 call that leads them to discover a million dollars sewn into the clothes of a dying man, erratic Dean persuades reluctant Eric to keep the money. When their colleagues, the dangerously seductive Brie and the temperamental fireman Max, learn of the matter, things grow more complicated as internal greed, betrayal, and double crosses ensue. Making matters even worse is an eccentric, opera-loving bag man who is on the hunt for the money as well. As twists, turns, and mayhem pile up, Dean and Eric soon discover that in the ambulance business, life or death are only one call away. Cast * Tom Everett Scott as Dean * James Jurdi as Eric * Angelica Celaya as Brie * Denis O‚ÄôHare as Craddock * Damon Dayoub as Max * Michael O'Neill as Beckwith * Charles Shaughnessy as Akkerman * Julissa Bermudez as Montez * Kelly Frye as Valerie * Stephen A. Chang as Wong Production The screenplay was written in the aftermath of the Great Recession and intended as an indictment of capitalism. The filmmakers wanted to tell a story about the anxiety and anger of working men and women who fear an uncertain future in an economy they‚Äôre told is strong. The script was also inspired by the director‚Äôs upbringing (his father was a medical doctor) and the ‚Äò80s/‚Äò90s buddy action comedies that he and the writer had grown up with. Tom Everett Scott joined the production only two days before cameras started rolling. Other actors that were considered for the role were Bokeem Woodbine, Seann William Scott, and Michael Rapaport. Damon Dayoub was initially cast as one of the corrupt ICE agents. But when the filmmakers couldn‚Äôt decide between Angelica Celaya and Julissa Bermudez for the role of Brie, they cast them both: Bermudez took over the ICE agent role from Dayoub who then went on to play firefighter Max instead. Prior to filming, director Tom Oesch spent a week choreographing all the fight scenes in the producer‚Äôs backyard. Because of the tight schedule, however, there was no time for stunt rehearsals ahead of principal photography and so the actors all had to quickly learn the choreography on set. Most of the ambulance interiors were ‚Äúcheated‚Äù in front of three large rear-projection screens that had been set up inside the same warehouse that doubled as the paramedics‚Äô headquarters. That warehouse was unfortunately also located right next door to a recycling plant, which made so much noise that a large portion of the dialog had to be re-recorded in post- production. Filming lasted 23 days. It took place in Los Angeles, Anaheim, Vernon, and Griffith Park. The initial director‚Äôs cut was a few minutes shorter than the final cut that was eventually shown in theaters. Reception David Duprey of That Moment In rated it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars and called it ‚Äúa clever comedy with a string of smart turns and a genuinely entertaining style that give it plenty to keep it in the black.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúwhat works best in all this is Oesch‚Äôs direction, his quick cuts and closeups helping a lot in giving it some momentum as it pushes towards its chaotic end. This is a good looking movie.‚Äù Writing for Horror Geek Life, Frankie Torok gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote that it is ‚Äúa fun movie, with some great performances and one hell of a climax‚Äù, adding that ‚ÄúThe stand-out performances definitely come from Scott and O‚ÄôHare. Dean‚Äôs a well crafted, ego-centric, charismatic nightmare, with not a single ounce of conscience, but as it turns out, a fairly big heart.‚Äù Remy Cashman of HorrorBuzz wrote that the film ‚Äúfeatures strong performances from leads played by Tom Everett Scott, Damon Dayoub, and James Jurdi‚Äù and added that ‚Äúa hand-held camera can be overwhelming but it works well for this film to reflect its overall energy and tone.‚Äù References External links  * GeekTyrant * HorrorNews.net * 28 Days Later Analysis * BroadwayWorld * Variety * LA Confidential Magazine Category:2018 films Category:2018 action comedy films Category:English- language films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Entertainment Studios films ","title":"Danger One"},{"id":"58859679","text":"The Kinkaid Limestone is a geologic formation in Indiana.

The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was formally made by way of the Palestine bill of 29 April 1948. A public statement prepared by the Colonial and Foreign offices confirmed termination of British responsibility for the administration of Palestine from midnight on 14 May 1948.  Background  The 1939 White Paper provided for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within 10 years. As explained by Malcolm MacDonald to the 1939 meeting of the Permanent Mandates Commission it was not clear at that stage what form such a state would take.\\"Minutes of the Thirty-Sixth Session Held at Geneva from June 8th to 29th, 1939\\" The February 1945 Yalta Conference agreed that arrangements would be made to provide for UN trusteeships for existing League Mandates. In July 1945, the Harrison Report was published,Penkower, Monty Noam. \\"The Earl Harrison Report: Its Genesis and Its Significance\\". American Jewish Archives Journal, 68, no.1 (2016): 1‚Äì75 describing the conditions of the displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe. In October 1945, then Foreign Secretary Bevin told the cabinet that Britain intended to turn over the Palestine problem to the UN except that Britain would be accused of evading its responsibilities if it did not first make some efforts of its own in resolving the situation. The League of Nations at its last meeting on 18 April 1946 agreed to liquidate and transfer all of its assets to the UN.League of Nations Chronology The assembly also passed a resolution approving and welcoming the intention of the British government to grant independence to Transjordan.Mandates, dependencies and trusteeship. League of Nations resolution, 18 April 1946 quoted in The report of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry was published 20 April 1946. That part of the mandate in respect of Transjordan legally ended on 17 June 1946 with the ratification of the Treaty of London. In July 1946, a committee created to establish how the Anglo-American proposals would be implemented proposed the Morrison‚ÄìGrady Plan. Following the failure of the 1946‚Äì47 London Conference on Palestine, at which the United States refused to support the British leading to both the Morrison‚ÄìGrady Plan and the Bevin Plan being rejected by all parties, the British decided to refer the question to the UN on 14 February 1947. The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created on 15 May 1947, reported on 3 September 1947 and on 29 November 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was passed. It recommended that the Mandate terminate as soon as possible and not later than 1 August 1948. Two weeks later, on 11 December, Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced that the British Mandate would terminate on 15 May 1948.  UN  The British requested that the Palestine question be placed on the agenda of the Second Regular Session of the General Assembly and that a Special Session be convened to constitute a Special Committee to prepare for Assembly consideration of the subject. The First Special Session of the General Assembly met between 28 April and 15 May 1947 to consider the British request. An attempt by the five Arab members of the UN (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria) to add an item to the agenda addressing the \\"termination of the Mandate over Palestine and the declaration of its independence\\" was unsuccessful. Following the publication of the UNSCOP report, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question was formed by a vote of the Second Regular Session of the General Assembly on 24 September 1947.  Palestine  Regulations governing land transfers and clauses relating to immigration were implemented although by 1944, 24,000 of 75,000 immigration certificates still remained for use. The immigration limits were relaxed to allow immigration at the rate of 18,000 a year as a reaction to the situation of Jewish refugees in Europe.Study (30 June 1978): The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem Part I: 1917-1947 - Study (30 June 1978), accessdate: 10 November 2018 With the end of the war, the new Labour Government, led by Clement Attlee, with Ernest Bevin as Foreign Secretary, decided to maintain the White Paper policy. Immediately after the UN resolution, the 1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out between the Arab and Jewish communities. On the last day of the Mandate, the creation of the State of Israel was proclaimed, and the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War began. In March 1948, the British Cabinet had agreed that the civil and military authorities in Palestine should make no effort to oppose the setting up of a Jewish State or a move into Palestine from Transjordan.CAB/128/12 formerly C.M.(48) 24 conclusions 22 March 1948 Sir Henry Gurney served as Chief Secretary in Palestine from October 1946 to termination and wrote a diary covering the period. A review by historian Rory Miller speaks approvingly of editor Golani's decision to include detailed scholarly annotations and perspectives to the diary.  Arab response  On 22 March 1945, the Arab league was founded. The Arab Higher Committee (AHC) was reconstituted in November of 1945 to represent Palestinian Arabs and met at the beginning of May 1946 to consider their response to the publication of the Anglo American report.H. Levenberg, \\"Bevin's Disillusionment: The London Conference, Autumn 1946\\", Middle Eastern Studies. p. 617 Vol. 27, No. 4 (October 1991) The Arab states reacted with summit meetings at Inshas at the end of May and Bloudan in June. After the failure of the London Conference and UN referral the Arabs continued to press their demand for an immediate independent Arab Palestine.  Jordan  Abdullah had connections with Zionists and Palestine over many years, an account is given by historian Mary Wilson Historians have described a meeting between Abdullah and the Jewish Agency on 17 November 1947 during which Abdullah is alleged to have reached an understanding in regard to Adullah's intent to occupy the Arab territories of the partition plan.Karsh, Efraim The Arab-Israeli Conflict, London: Osprey, 2002 p. 51. Following the end of the mandate, the Jordanian Arab Legion, under the leadership of Sir John Bagot Glubb, known as Glubb Pasha, was ordered to enter Palestine and secure the UN designated Arab area.Sir John Bagot Glubb, A Soldier with the Arabs, London 1957, p. 200  Zionist response  In May 1942, the Biltmore Conference in New York City with 600 delegates and Zionist leaders from 18 countries attending, demands \\"that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth\\" (state), rather than a \\"homeland.\\"  American response  At the end of August 1945, U.S. President Harry Truman issues a statement requesting the British government to admit 100,000 Jewish refugees in Europe into Palestine. On 14 May 1948, the United States de facto recognized the provisional Jewish government contemporaneously declared (de jure recognition on 31 January 1949).  Legal issues and reasons to terminate Law professor Shabtai Rosenne says that there is no clear answer as to why the British took this step and lists miscalculation as well as political and military fatigue among others. Ravndal cites works from the 80s establishing that the British were motivated by \\"economic necessity and plain exhaustion\\" but then goes on to posit that the British were motivated by a Cold War desire to secure Britain's interests in the rest of the Middle East. A summary of different views is given by Benny Morris. Mandates were intended to end with the independence of the Mandated territory. The British government had taken the position that there was nothing in law to prevent termination due to frustration of purpose. In the event, the UNSCOP report recommended both that the Mandate be terminated and independence granted at the earliest practicable dates with a transition period between these events.

Dunn's work involved the origins and development of cancer in laboratory mice. She developed methods of inducing malignant tumors in the stomachs and intestines of experimental animals and studied the behavior of the cancer cells that resulted. Dunn is known as the \\"First Lady of Cancer Research\\". According to Harold L. Stewart of the National Cancer Institute, Dunn's important contributions to the field of cancer research include her studies of mammary tumors, reticulum-cell sarcomas, leukemia, plasma-cell tumors, mast-cell tumors, the granular-cell tumors, cervical cancer and the common liver tumor of the mouse. Stewart also mentions Dunn's discoveries the protein-secreting, plasma-cell tumors that originate in the ileocecal region of mice, a finding that initiated a program of animal research that's led to a better understanding of the fatality of human cancer. She developed lines of a transplantable mast-cell tumor of a mouse, now known as \\"Dunn cells\\", used widely in laboratory studies.  Publications  President John F.

Design and Construction In 1901 Clyde Steamship & Co. following an increase in their freight business placed an order for two steamers of approximately to serve on their East coast route between Boston and Jacksonville. Kiowa was the second of these vessels and was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons' Kensington Yard in Philadelphia (yard number 321) and launched on 9 May 1903, with Miss Elizabeth Milne, niece of B. Frank Clyde, a general agent and vice-president of Clyde Steamship Company, serving as the sponsor. The ship was of the three- deck type, designed specifically for cargo trade, and had all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of heavy cargoes, including a large number of derricks and modern cranes similar to her sister-ship SS Huron. Following an inspection and the successful completion of sea trials, the steamer was transferred to her owners and departed for New York on June 14. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Kiowa was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 4,500. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 188 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history Upon delivery Kiowa sailed from Philadelphia for New York on June 14, 1903. After loading, she departed on her maiden voyage on June 17, arriving at Charleston on June 20. The vessel then continued down to Jacksonville for loading, and left it on June 24 for her return trip. After stopping at Charleston to take on more cargo, she arrived at New York on June 27, thus ending her maiden voyage. Kiowa continued serving the same route for the rest of her career, connecting Charleston and Jacksonville with Boston and New York, with occasional stops at Brunswick. The steamer carried a variety of general cargo from the southern ports, mostly lumber, cotton, naval stores, vegetables and fruit. In the evening of September 15, 1903 Kiowa was proceeding on her trip from Boston to Charleston, and while between Cape Poge and Cross Rip Shoal in hazy weather struck the port bow of schooner Howard B. Peck on her way from Norfolk for Calais with a cargo of coal. As a result, the schooner had her bowsprit and flying jibboom carried away together with all sails and rigging, and had a 20 feet wide gap was open in her hull. Kiowa took the schooner in tow and brought her into Vineyard Haven at around 21:00 on the same day. The steamer suffered little damage and was able to continue on her voyage. Sinking Kiowa left Jacksonville on the return leg of her 14th coastal trip on December 18, 1903, bound for New York and Boston. She was under command of captain Ira Ketcham Chichester, had a crew of 31 men and was fully loaded. The vessel stopped at Charleston to embark more cargo and departed from port on December 21. After calling at New York on December 23 where she discharged a portion of her load, she continued to Boston. The bulk of her cargo consisted of nearly 200,000 feet of hard pine lumber, in addition to cotton, rice, rosin, turpentine, iron and oranges and pineapples. The vessel passed the Highland Light around 07:15 on December 26 and soon after encountered a snowstorm. The seas became rougher and the wind got stronger and when the ship arrived at the entrance to the Boston harbor the snow squalls were so thick it was nearly impossible to see anything. Under those circumstances, captain Chichester decided to anchor the ship just off the entrance to the harbor, about two miles off the Boston Light and in line with Thieves Ledge to the east. Due to heavy snowstorm, Kiowa only had one lookout and a watch officer on deck ringing the bell periodically, with the rest of the crew being below or in their quarters. At about 10:00 on the same day United Fruit Company's freighter Admiral Dewey, under command of captain F. S. Israel, departed Boston carrying some cargo, mails and 35 passengers to Port Antonio and Puerto Lim√≥n. While it was snowing at the time of her departure, it was possible to see the buoys and other navigational guides, and captain Israel had no problem slowly sailing out of the harbor and through the narrows. By the time the ship arrived by Boston Light, the weather suddenly changed for the worse, with heavy snowfall reducing visibility to practically nothing. At around 11:20, about a mile south of Boston Light, one of the lookouts on board the fruiter suddenly spotted a ship lying across her course, and the captain pulled the helm hard aport and ordered the engines to be reversed, but due to very short distance between the vessels, Admiral Dewey smashed straight into Kiowa port side nearly cutting her in half. The ships soon separated opening a gaping hole in injured steamer's hull, and water started to rush in. Captain Chichester immediately ordered the watertight bulkhead doors closed and a distress calls were blown while Admiral Dewey remained nearby trying to figure out her damage. The distress calls were heard by the health department towboat Cormorant which happened to be about a quarter mile away from the place of the collision, towing a scow on her return trip to the city. Cormorant swung towards the vessels and as she closed in, Admiral Dewey started to move away, apparently only slightly damaged, and satisfied that Kiowa was getting attended to. Members of Kiowas crew were mostly grouping on her bow, as her stern was slowly sinking, and were transferred one by one to the towboat. Once that was accomplished, Cormorant started toward the harbor and was soon after met by two tugs, Pallas and Storm King, sent to the rescue. 16 men were transferred to them from Cormorant and all three vessels proceeded to Boston arriving in port around 14:30. After filing his report with Clyde Steamship Co., captain Chichester returned aboard tug Storm King to the place of the accident to evaluate prospects of salvage work. However, by the time of his arrival, the bulkhead doors that apparently kept the steamer's bow up above the water, gave in and the ship went to the bottom, sinking in approximately of water. The only things that could be seen were Kiowa two masts and her smoke-stack. The wreck was examined by divers the next day to evaluate the damage sustained by the vessel, to assess the possibility of patching the hole in her hull, and prospects of raising the ship and possible unloading her cargo. Since the condition of the steamer's hull was not fully known it was decided first to remove as much cargo as possible before further evaluation could be performed. The work on discharging cargo started right away and continued for several days while the weather was still good, with cargo beingtransferred to lighters and carried to port. On January 2, 1904 a storm swept through the area and possibly damaged Kiowa as a lot of wreckage came ashore afterwards, including barrels of turpentine, cases of oranges, bales of lumber and cotton. Large quantities of timber came ashore in Nantasket destroying several wooden breakwaters in the process, while many cases of oranges and barrels of oil and turpentine were washed on shore and picked up by local residents. Following the storm, the weather remained stormy for about a week and no more cargo removal was done, and in the meantime, the wreck was marked with a bell buoy to warn ships entering and exiting the harbor. Another storm came on January 11, and considerable amount of timber was seen floating around the wreck in the ice afterwards. A few more storms went through the area preventing the wrecking company from being able to do any further work on the wreck. Some of the cargo that was washed up, and collected from the sea was sold locally at auctions netting the wrecking company a few thousand dollars, while some of the timber was found washed up on the beach as far away as Chatham. On June 8, 1904 it was announced that the wrecking company decided to abandon the work on trying to raise Kiowa. On July 16 U.S. Engineer Office gave a notice that unless the wreck of Kiowa was removed within 30 days it would be destroyed by the United States government. Another company stepped in at the end of July in an attempt to remove as much cargo as possible, and was able to clear one of the hatches and pull out some of the steamer's cargo, but all attempts to raise the vessel did not succeed. The vessel was finally abandoned on August 31, and on September 8 the Boston Towboat company, who made the original attempt to remove the cargo and raise the ship, started preparations for blowing up the wreck. On September 19 it was reported that the deck was blown up and approximately 50,000 feet of lumber was secured from the steamer's hold.

It is based on the comment by United States President Donald Trump that \\"it's a very scary time for young men in America\\", which he said amid the sexual assault allegations against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The song contains a list of situations in which men have harassed, coerced, or sexually assaulted women in the U.S. The list also includes some of the past responses from the American public, media, and legal system to women who have accused men of such acts. Background In response to allegations that his nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States, Brett Kavanaugh, had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and another woman; President Donald Trump said: \\"I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of.\\" Lynzy Lab, a Texan dancer, choreographer, singer-songwriter, dance instructor at the Texas State University, and a former principal dancer at the Houston Metropolitan Dance Company; was inspired by Trump's comment to write a satirical song: A victim of sexual assault herself, Lab also heard many stories about sexual assault from women to whom she has taught dance. She said that she hoped that the song \\"would lift a little bit of the weight\\". Song The two-and-a-half-minute song's lyrics satirize men who are anxious because of the Me Too movement, pointing out all of the things that women are told not to do in order to avoid being sexually assaulted. In the refrain, Lab exposes what she sees as false equivalences between male violence against women and supposed male victimization by sexual assault allegations: \\"But it sure is a scary time for boys!\\" Lab does not mention Trump or Kavanaugh in the video, but references the 35-year interval between Ford's and Ramirez's alleged assault and their accusations (\\"I can't speak out against my rapist after 35 years\\"). Lab momentarily pauses near the end of the song, realizing \\"it's not such scary time for boys / they've always had the upper hand, they've always had a choice\\". Lab says that it is time for women to \\"rise up\\" and \\"use our collective voice\\", and urges the listener to \\"make some noise\\" by voting in the 2018 United States elections on November 6. In her original video, Lab performed solo, singing and playing a ukulele; in her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! she was accompanied by a chorus of more than a dozen women. Release and reception Lab posted the video on YouTube Saturday, October 6, the same day that Kavanaugh was confirmed and sworn in as Supreme Court justice. The song became a viral hit, with over 11.4 million views on Twitter in the first five days and more than 28 million on Facebook in the first two days. The video received a warm response on social media and was endorsed by celebrities, including Mark Ruffalo, Ellen DeGeneres, Matthew Modine, Patricia Arquette and Alyssa Milano. Lab said that she \\"did not expect such an overwhelming response\\" and described the attention that her song received as \\"surreal and very exciting\\". She told ABC that strangers were sharing their stories with her, which she said \\"[is] truly the most rewarding feeling\\". Stewart performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on the International Day of the Girl, which encourages female leadership. The host Jimmy Kimmel said that the Me Too movement and the events surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation as Supreme Court justice had illuminated the risks and fear that women face as part of their everyday life. According to Australian columnist Van Badham writing for The Guardian, Lab‚Äôs song \\"exposes Donald Trump's rightwing mythology of confected male victimhood\\". Identifying A Scary Time as part of a \\"[tradition] of confrontation between cultural resisters and the state\\", Badham compares Lab to prominent protest song artists, such as Phil Ochs. In Vanity Fair, Laura Bradley described the song as \\"brutally sarcastic\\". Writing for The Washington Post, Timothy Bella stated that Lab had \\"morphed into the newest feminist voice of the Democratic resistance\\". Dan Solomon of Texas Monthly compared the song's focus to the Him Too movement, which casts doubt on all sexual assault allegations based on an alleged conspiracy against men. Lab received criticism from the video allegedly attempting to mock men. She responded in a tweet she posted on October 10: \\"Just to clear up any confusion: I'm not here to delegitimize men's struggles. I'm just hoping that we can finally start legitimizing women's. Regardless of what you've decided about me, I'm not 'anti-men'. I am, however, super 'pro-women'.

The book is separated into three parts, exploring different historical and philosophical perspectives on race over time.  Flight From Egypt  The study first introduces the Exodus in Al Sharpton's Go Tell Pharaoh. The Exodus, the story of the Jews' flight from Egypt and Israel's delivery from Egypt is referenced in the title of autobiography of a Black author. Philipson claims that though many cultures are recognized by the myths associated with them, like the British with King Arthur and Americans with George Washington and the cherry tree, the singular myth of the Exodus functions as an identifier of both Black and Jewish cultures. For Jewish culture, the Exodus is rehearsed yearly at Passover as a fundamental ritual to Jewish culture. It is then noted by Albert Raboteau that the Exodus story was appropriated by African slaves to give a way to articulate their sense of identity , which was based on the shared heritage of enslavement. As a result, the Exodus story was adopted by enslaved Blacks who related to the suffering of the Hebrews to their own, desired the Promised Land of Freedom, and sought the Moses who would free them.  The Light From the West  The first book length Black autobiography by Olaudah Equiano is the first reference to Eighteenth century perspectives. In the autobiography, Equiano extends a comparison between Blacks and Jews in their cultural practices. In the comparison Equiano notes similarities such as rule by chiefs or elders, sacrifice or burnt offerings made to deities, and engagement in washings and purifications. From this comparison, Equiano claims that one people came from the other, stating that Blacks were descendants of biblical Jews. Equiano's conclusion acknowledged the prevailing environmentalism of the eighteenth century, depicting Africans as a degenerated species of humanity. Though there were many theories to the racial differences between Blacks and Caucasians at the time, one by Baron de Montesquieu gained traction claiming climate accounted for the differences between people as well as societies. This theory not only affected Blacks at the time, but it also affected Jews. For Jews, the theory, according to defenders of contemporary Jews, to argue their manifest inferiority was, in fact, not innate and ineradicable. Baron de Montesquieu's environmentalism-centric view continued further in Isaac de Pinto's explanation of the differences between Jews in Europe, stating that Montesquieu's claim explained the 'wealthy and cultured Sephardim in southern France' and the 'miserable, uncouth Ashkenazim of eastern France'. The perspective on Blacks and Jews changed once again when the Jewish community came under attack for a money-lending role in the local economy and Christian Wilhelm Dohm, a Prussian official, was called upon to compose a treatise allowing Jews fair treatment by the state. In his writing, Dohm did not distinguish between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, but instead claimed the shortcomings of Jews were, in fact, the shortcomings of the trading class and can be changed by altering their circumstances.  Mid-Century Perspectives  Nineteenth century perspectives closely resembled those of the eighteenth century in that racial differences were essential in understanding human behavior. According to Philipson, there were twentieth century publicists of racism that could make claims about the inferiority of Blacks and Jews based on the environmentalism of the eighteenth century and scientific racism of the nineteenth. However, there occurred a shift from intellectuals such as Franz Boas who argued that racial differences were not a result of geographical determinism, but rather emerged from the interaction with preexisting cultures that had risen out of historical circumstance. Boas never entirely rid of the notion of using race as a meaningful category of species classification, Boas' work contributed to the notion that social conditions were just as powerful a factor as biology is in human development.

It was printed as a paid ad in 1958,Title: Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry? in response to a similar ad by The National Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy urging that the US unilaterally end testing.Robert A. Heinlein, a biography by William H. Patterson, Jr SANE was famously advocating a ban on nuclear testing by the United States, emphasizing the danger of exposure to fallout. This was supported by an estranged Heinlein friend, Isaac Asimov, who later said he was happy to have \\"played a very small part in bringing about the nuclear-test ban\\". He had written a paper detailing the effects of carbon-14 on human beings called The Radioactivity of the Human Body, the first popular media examination of the issue. When SANE took out an ad to this effect in Heinlein's local newspaper, Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph, Heinlein, within days, responded with his own ad. In it, he acknowledged that nuclear testing has some impact but not anything like the claims he described as \\"willfully distorted,\\" but stated that even if the very slight impact was \\"a hundred times as great we still would choose it to the dead certainty of Communist enslavement.\\" His article had started with a Patrick Henry quote: After stating that there was indeed a danger of death by nuclear war, Heinlein stated, \\"These are the risks. The alternative is surrender. We accept the risks.\\"Book: Expanded Universe Heinlein sent this article to many of his friends with a reaction that was, at best, mixed. Even among those who agreed with him, the author and editor John W. Campbell responded, \\"Your newspaper ads aren‚Äôt going to do much good, Bob, because the Common Man is in control... and he's quite incapable of understanding the complexities of the systems he's controlling.\\"The Heirs of Sputnik Ultimately, a petition was sent to US President Dwight Eisenhower from Heinlein's \\"Patrick Henry League\\" with 500 signatures, advocating continued nuclear testing. On October 31, 1958, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union entered into a three-year moratorium on nuclear weapon testing. A side effect of the general incident was that Heinlein stopped working on his current book, with a working title of The Heretic, to write a novel in which he attempted to express his own principles of community service and sacrifice for the common good, Starship Soldiers.May the Armed Forces Be with You: The Relationship Between Science Fiction and the United States Military In it, characters learned the values of civic virtue and community service, while serving in a futuristic Mobile Infantry using power armor suits often credited as helping invent the mecha genre of Science Fiction. This was serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It was later published as a novel, Starship Troopers, in 1959. In a later reprinting of The Heirs of Patrick Henry in Expanded Universe,Rite of Passage and Robert Heinlein Heinlein emphasized that he was demonstrating public service, not militarism, by stating: \\"In Starship Troopers, it is stated flatly and more than once that nineteen out of twenty veterans are not military veterans. Instead, 95% of voters are what we call today 'former members of federal civil service.'\\" The book that he had put off finishing, The Heretic, was completed and published in 1961 as Stranger in a Strange Land, exploring a philosophical flip side and becoming seen as a sort of founding document of the hippie movement.The Hippie Narrative: A Literary Perspective on the Counterculture References Category:Political literature category:nuclear weapons Category:1958 essays Category:Works by Robert A.

It is a relatively new isocyanate introduced in the 1980s by American Cyanamid. TMXDI is often classified as an aliphatic isocyanate despite the presence of the central aromatic ring. Aliphatic isocyanates generally exhibit enhanced UV stability vs their aromatic counterparts. There have also been patents published showing the uses of TMXDI and also a number of papers. Many isocyanates are produced by the phosgenation process whereas TMXDI is not. 438x438px  Uses  A key use for TMXDI is in manufacturing polyurethane prepolymers. It is also used to manufacture Polyurethane dispersions (PUDs).. These materials are then further used to manufacture coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. TMXDI has been considered as a replacement for Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). IPDI has a molecular weight of 222.3 and thus a NCO equivalent weight of 111.15. TMXDI has a molecular weight of 244.3 and thus an equivalent weight of 122.15. Thus per mole, approximately 10% more is required than the equivalent prepolymer based on IPDI. This difference increases cost. There are advantages though with TMXDI especially when making Polyurethanes Dispersions(PUDs). The NCO groups on the molecule are sterically hindered and also tertiary which makes them slower reacting. This is good when dispersing a prepolymer in water to make a PUD. It reduces side reactions and allows more time to allow the dispersion stage before the mix is chain extended. This is done usually with a diamine.. It has even found use in a rocket propellant binder by the US military Safety Extensive data has become available.

It stars Analeigh Tipton, Jakob Cedergren and Marta Gastini. It premiered at the Torino Film Festival in November 2016. Plot Sadie Glass (Tipton) is on a book tour with her boyfriend, Thierry (Merlet). She is promoting her book that details her chaotic relationship with Alex (Cedergren), which is implied to have been sexual and violent. At an event in Italy, Alex shows up and invites Sadie to spend the weekend with him instead of meeting Thierry's family in Paris. Disenchanted with her current relationship, she agrees to meet Alex at a club. There, they meet Francesca (Gastini), who performs an erotic dance. Sadie agrees to join Alex only if Francesca joins them. At the villa, Sadie and Francesca drink and take drugs and begin a sexual relationship while Alex prepares for a party. At the party, many guests arrive, take drugs, and have sex with one another. Sadie walks into a room where a woman's throat is slit and she is lifted into the air by her arms. Sadie awakens with a start, questioning whether what she saw was real. She confronts Alex, who blames her for not knowing what she was getting herself into. Sadie leaves the villa and tries to leave town. She asks a man in a car to drive her away, but the man attacks and drugs her, returning her to the villa. When she wakes up, Alex cleans her up and tells her it was just a game. That night, before another party, Thierry shows up and tells Sadie that he loves her. Sadie rebuffs him and searches for Alex. She tells Alex that Thierry doesn't belong here, and that if he lets Thierry go, she will do what he wants. Francesca gives Sadie more drugs, but while she isn't looking, Sadie spits them out. Alex escorts Sadie to a room full of people surrounding Thierry, who is tied up in the same way the woman was the previous night. Francesca, dressed as an executioner, gives Sadie a knife. Sadie approaches Thierry and cuts her own arm behind his back while the rest of the crowd begins to kiss and fondle each other. As Sadie moves to cut Thierry's bonds, Alex attempts to stop her but she stabs him in the stomach. Furious, Francesca slits Thierry's throat and runs away. Some time later, in New York City, Sadie is at a restaurant, promoting a new book. It reveals she actually killed Alex in Paris, before the movie even began. She sees Francesca in the crowd and they speak afterwards, Francesca implying that Sadie will soon return to the violent and sex-filled world she's trying to run away from. Outside, as Sadie is being photographed, she sees Francesca enter a car and sit next to Alex.

Pierce (January 9, 1860 - August 21, 1951) was a prominent real estate speculator in Boise City, Idaho, USA, in the late 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century. Pierce served as mayor of Boise City 1895-97 as it evolved from being a frontier community to being a modern town. Early life Walter E. Pierce was born January 9, 1860, in Waco, Texas, to parents Charles and Elizabeth (Harding) Pierce, from Providence, Rhode Island. The Pierce family had moved from Providence in 1854 and settled in Bell County, Texas, where Charles Pierce operated a sheep ranch. After Walter was born the family moved to Baxter Springs, Kansas, and Charles died there in 1860, leaving six children. After the death of her husband, Elizabeth Pierce moved the family to Vicksburg, Mississippi, but after seven years the family returned to Kansas. Later, Walter attended business college. In 1882 Pierce had become proprietor of the Arcade Hotel in Rich Hill, Missouri, and he remained at the hotel at least until May, 1883. Pierce married Georgianna Margaret Mundy at the Palace Hotel in Butler, Missouri, on February 1, 1882. Career Advertisement for W. E. Pierce & Co. in 1891 Soon after Idaho Territory became a state in 1890, the Pierces moved in September from Richfield, Kansas, to Boise City. By October of that year, along with partners John M. Haines and L. H. Cox, he had founded W. E. Pierce & Co., a real estate and abstract company originally located at 820 Main Street, across from the Lemp Block.Zion Bank and the bank garage now occupy the site. W. E. Pierce & Co. were exclusive agents for the Resseguie Addition, the Hyde Park Addition, the Lemp Addition, Lemp's East Side Addition, the DeLamar Addition, the Bryon Addition, and others.For example, the Locust Grove and Brumbach Additions. The company also planted trees in areas under development. For the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, Pierce & Co. produced 5000 copies of a pamphlet, Boise the Beautiful, to be distributed from the fair's Idaho Building. Then in 1895 the pamphlet was again distributed to attract settlers from Eastern states and capital from Eastern banking interests. Pierce was nominated for mayor of Boise City in 1895, a position he had not sought and one which his friends mistakenly believed he would decline. A Democrat, Pierce won the election and served one term as mayor 1895-97. During his tenure, Boise City collected road taxes, installed paved streets, cement sidewalks, and regulated electric lines, telephone poles, and hydrants. The city also enacted ordinances prohibiting prostitution and promoting orderly conduct on city streets. In 1905 Pierce organized the Boise & Interurban Railroad, a 60-mile electric streetcar loop from Boise to Caldwell. One stop on the streetcar loop was Pierce Park, constructed in 1907 four miles from Boise. Inspired by Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, the trolley park was a popular destination during the era of streetcars. In 1910 Pierce opened Boise's new Idaho Building, a skyscraper of which the Idaho Statesman wrote: \\"Six stories in height, it towers above its neighbors like a mountain peak.\\" When the Hotel Boise (Hoff Building) was constructed in 1930, Pierce was president and major stockholder. The building is listed with the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing resource in the Boise Capitol Area District. In addition to holding other offices, Pierce served as a director of the Artesian Hot and Cold Water Company, as president of the Boise Natatorium, as president of the Allen-Wright Furniture Co., as president of the Farmer's Bank of Star, and as president of the Boise Chamber of Commerce. Pierce constructed a series of homes in Boise for his family. The Walter E. Pierce House (1914), designed by Wayland & Fennell, was purchased by the State of Idaho in 1947 and served as the official governor's mansion from 1947 to 1990. Death Walter E.

He studied most European and Asian languages, and the history and geography of the East. He was an associate of the orientalist Johannes Hendricus van der Palm, and Theodor Juynboll was among his pupils. Life Hamaker's father intended him for a career in business, however his evident intelligence and keen interest in ancient languages from an early age led patrons to sponsor his education at the prestigious Atheneaeum Illustre of his native Amsterdam, to study classical and oriental languages. There, under the tutelage of professors van Lennep and Wilmett he, though far from abandoning classical languages (especially ancient and byzantine Greek), focused on oriental studies. In 1815‚Äì1817 he was professor of Oriental languages at the Athenaeum of Franeker (formerly the University of Franeker), and lectured on Arabic, Chaldean and Syriac. From 1817‚Äì1822 he held the post of \\"extraordinary\\" professor Oriental languages and title of Interpres Legati Warneriani (Interpreter of the legacy of Levinus Warner) at Leiden University. In 1820 Hamaker published his Specimen of a catalog of oriental manuscripts of Warner's bequest, which included descriptions of the Futuh (Conquests) of Baladhuri, a section of Al-Tabari's great history, the Murudj al-Dhahab (Fields of Gold) of Al-Masudi, etc. In 1822 Hamaker became full professor of Oriental languages (especially Arabic), (1822‚Äì1835). Hamaker belonged to a number of learned institutions and, in 1829, was honored with a knighthood of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He spent his life of forty-six years in tireless literary inquiry. Through his lectures and writings he pioneered studies of eastern literature and languages throughout Europe and beyond. Hamaker was the first Dutch scholar to give a series of eight public lectures (in 1834; published 1835) on the comparison of Greek, Latin and the Germanic languages with Sanskrit, thus instigating (though not establishing) the study of Indo-European comparative linguistics in Holland. He died at the family's summer residence Rhodesteyn, near the village of Nederlangbroek, nine days after his wife Johanna Camper (granddaughter of Petrus Camper), on the 7th of October 1835. Like some of their seven children, both parents had contracted scarlet fever to the consequences of which both succumbed. They were buried at the churchyard of Nederlangbroek. All of the seven children survived into adulthood.

Sargent was also producer of the American version of the seminal news-satire program, That Was the Week That Was, which also aired on NBC, from January 1964 to May 1965.

Porter Copyrighted on August 13, 1903, the 725 ft., 35mm film lasted roughly 10 minutes if projected at 20 frames per second. Plot The picture was subsequently described in an Edison catalog: The first scene shows a country couple entering Steeplechase Park. They proceed to amuse themselves on the steeplechase, rope bridge, the \\"Down and Out\\" and riding the bulls. The scene then changes to a panorama of Luna Park, showing Rube and Mandy doing stunts on the rattan slide, riding on the miniature railway, shooting the chutes, riding the boats in the old mill, and visiting Professor Wormwood's Monkey theatre. They next appear on the Bowery, visiting the fortune tellers, striking the punching machine and winding up with the frankfurter man. The climax shows a bust view of Rube and Mandy eating frankfurters. Interesting for the humorous features, and the excellent views of Coney Island and Luna Park.Edison Manufacturing Company, Edison Films, October 1903, 16. Release and reception The film itself was quickly advertised in the New York Clipper and was soon appearing in vaudeville theaters throughout the country as the headline attraction in their film program.Edison advertisement, New York Clipper, 15 August 1903. In some instances, Rube and Mandy at Coney Island was on the opening bills for the 1903-04 theatrical season. This was a pivotal moment for cinema in many respects, including the shift to longer story films of which this is a somewhat tentative example. Moreover, as the new theatrical season began, exhibition services had added the three-blade shutter to their projectors, which reduced flicker and increased viewing pleasure. To some extent, the film‚Äôs reception benefited from this innovation; in any case, many newspapers hailed it as a wild success. The Jacques Theater in Waterbury, Ct, began its new season with the film on its vaudeville bill. The local theater reviewer observed that: ‚ÄúUnlimited praise might be given every act on the bill, but the electrotype pictures of Rube and Mandy at Coney Island have been so much talked about that it probably monopolizes the chief attention. It is enough to say of it that anyone who misses seeing it will miss something that is as laugh-producing as anything that can be imagined.‚Äù‚ÄúVaudeville at the Jacques,‚Äù Waterbury Evening Democrat, 2 September 1903. The film garnered additional kudos when shown the following week at Poli‚Äôs in New Haven: ‚ÄúThe children do enjoy the journey of Mandy and Reuben to Coney Island as shown in the electrograph. It‚Äôs worth bringing them to see. It was a hit last night even with the grown-ups.‚Äù‚ÄúPoli‚Äôs Theater,‚Äù New Haven Journal and Courier, 9 September 1903. The eletrograph service showed it the following week at Poli‚Äôs Hartford Theater where it ‚Äúaroused so much hilarity.‚Äù‚ÄúElla Wheeler Wilcox at Poli‚Äôs,‚Äù Hartford Courant, 19 September 1903. The film continued to be shown by traveling showmen for the next few years‚Äì‚Äìand continued to be screened into the nickelodeon era.‚ÄúThe Hardwick Theater,‚Äù Arizona Republican, 30 September 1905. In popular culture Rube [short for Reuben] and Mandy were stock characters in American popular culture. Along with Uncle Josh, they were country folk with little or no knowledge of city ways. In short, they were ‚Äúhicks‚Äù whose encounters with city living were often a source of comedy. They show up, if only very occasionally, in early newspapers, going back to the 1880s and continued into the first decade of the twentieth century.‚ÄúMillie, the Orphan,‚Äù Maryville (Tennessee) Times, 9 November 1887, 3; ‚ÄúHer One Desire,‚Äù Brooklyn Eagle, 12 November 1900, 2;‚ÄúIs a Joke No Longer,‚Äù Arizona Journal-Miner, 27 May 1903, 2. This was a transitional moment in terms of head titles. The film lacks a head title, which was doubtlessly supplied by the exhibitor using a lantern slide.

The show told the story of the 1998 Warner Bros. animated film Quest for Camelot, featuring music and lyrics by Patrick Doyle as well as fireworks, lasers, and water projections. Development and history Warner Bros. began developing live productions based on Quest for Camelot in 1996 while the film was still in production, the first of which was Quest for Camelot Nights. For Quest for Camelot Nights to occupy the same space as the Lethal Weapon: Water Stunt Spectacular! on Switlik Lake, Lethal Weapon's boat and garage were modified and made double- sided so that they could be reversed every night in under an hour. At night, The boat became Merlin's castle, and the garage became a platform. A floating iceberg was also re-used from a previous show and re-painted to look like a rock jutting out of the water, which was hidden behind the boat during the day. The show premiered at the start of the 1998 season, and was originally only intended to run through Labor Day, but its popularity ended up making Six Flags have it return for three more seasons, with the show's final performance happening in 2001. Cancelled tour Other than Quest for Camelot Nights, Warner Bros. was also planning a touring live production to coincide with the release of Quest for Camelot. The tour was supposed to debut at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in 1998, and then travel to different renaissance fairs throughout the United States. The project was later cancelled soon after the release of the film, with Warner Bros. citing the film's poor box office returns and the tour's anticipated expenses as the reason for its cancellation. Quest for Camelot only made back $38 million of its $40 million budget, making it a box office bomb. References Category:Former Warner Bros.

The first meeting was held in Perth in early 1924, and their first four branches were established the same year. Mabel Craven-Griffith was elected the first president at their first conference in 1925. It was part of the Country Women's Association (CWA). The Association's purpose was \\"to improve the welfare and conditions of life of people everywhere, especially those living in the country, to foster friendship and understanding and to encourage co-operation and community effort\\". Their first priority was to establish rest rooms; located in the CWA of WA branches, these spaces provided a place for rural women and their children to rest and eat when they were in the town. In 1934 the CWA of WA began publishing The Countrywoman of Western Australia their newsletter, which became a monthly publication in 1940. Of note was the CWA of WA's participation in the war effort during World War II, establishing a war relief fund and participating in the Australian Women's Land Army. Membership reached its peak in the mid 1950s with 12,000 members in about 250 branches. In 2001 the CWA of WA left the national Country Women's Association, but remains active.

The station was crowded due to many fans, traveling to the Rome Olympic stadium, to watch a game between CSKA Moscow and AS Roma, in the Champions League. A group of CSKA fans were going down into the station, with witnesses raising claims that they were jumping and singing before the incident. The escalator suddenly sped up sending people on the stairs at a fast pace, with little time for those at the bottom to get out of the way. Some fans attempted to escape by utilizing the median to either slide down, or get to the other escalator. After the escalator was stopped, a photo was released of the escalator stairs crumpled at the bottom, exposing jagged and exposed metal plates.  Victims  Seven people were reported to have been seriously injured, with varying accounts of the total amount of injured. Some of the injured were trapped between the metal plates of the steps at the bottom of the escalator.  Aftermath  Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi issued a request for a formal inquest over the cause of the malfunction. The entire Repubblica station was closed so that investigators and firefighters could carry out all investigations and rescue operations.

It marks the acting debut of Norwegian film actress Liv Ullmann who had previously appeared as an uncredited extra in Edith Carlmar's 1957 film Fools in the Mountain. The film is about the affair between two young lovers, the uneducated and wild Gerd, and her bourgeois boyfriend, university student Anders who decides to run away with Gerd to continue their relationship when his parents disapprove of them. Plot Anders (Atle Merton) is about to enter university. He is enamoured with Gerd (Liv Ullmann), a high school drop out who has a reputation for being promiscuous. After Anders's mother refuses to allow Anders to bring Gerd on a camping trip he steals his father's car and runs away with Gerd to a remote hunting cabin he and his father stayed in once before. Gerd, an illegitimate child raised by a working single mother, dreams of being loved and pampered with luxurious things and is not impressed at first with the shabby cabin and lack of store bought food. Even as Anders attempts to make things more comfortable for Gerd she begins to suffer from mood swings fearing that Anders thinks of her as a whore and is using her for her body. When she tries to run away however Anders finds her and convinces her to come back, promising to take her into town for cigarettes and dancing. In the meantime the car that Anders and Gerd drove to the cabin is discovered by the local sheriff. Anders's father and Gerd's mother take the train to go and see if they can find the young lovers and bring them home. Gerd's mother is very open, talking to Anders's father about the possibility that Gerd is pregnant and her reputation for being sexually promiscuous, which Anders's father finds shocking. When they arrive they come across Anders and Gerd totally nude which amuses Gerd's mother and embarrasses Anders's father. To the surprise of Anders and Gerd, while their parents lecture them briefly, neither parents forces them to come home, instead leaving them at the cabin with extra supplies. After two weeks Gerd once again begins to grow bored, especially as Anders has not kept his promise of taking her to town. Just as they are about to kill a sheep they have stolen to eat a stranger arrives. The stranger helps the two to skin the sheep and seems to know everything about their remote area leading Anders to suspect he is the true owner of the cabin, though the man continues to claim he is a stranger to the area. Gerd begins to flirt with the stranger and he begins to make sexual advances towards her as well, much to Anders's dismay. Later that night the group go to the local store where the stranger breaks in and steals the supplies they need. When Gerd follows him inside she and the stranger share a kiss during which the necklace that Anders made her breaks. Anders is upset over the grocery robbery and begs Gerd to leave with him. Sick of him Gerd approaches the stranger and begs him to take her with him. He propositions her sexually and grows angry when she declines, calling her a whore but promising to take her with him anyway. Anders, increasingly jealous, threatens to kill Gerd if she leaves him. Gerd's mother arrives on a scooter to tell Anders that his parents are sick of his excursion with Gerd and are coming the next day to bring him back home. She introduces herself to the stranger who reveals that he really is the owner of the place, Bendik. The following morning Gerd wakes up early and goes to Bendik hoping to run away with him. As she and Bendik watch, the police arrive and take Anders and Gerd's mother away with them. Anders's parents cover the theft of the sheep and the fact that he tried to pay for his stolen groceries also mostly absolves him of his crimes in the eyes of the police. Furious Anders runs away again and returns to the cabin where he confronts Bendik. In his anger and rage he hits Bendik with an axe and accidentally sets off a fire. Realizing that Bendik is still alive Gerd and Anders drag him out of the barn and try to nurse him back to health. Anders reveals that he was angry enough to have killed Bendik, making Gerd feel loved. Bendik recovers enough to wake up. He allows Anders and Gerd to leave as Gerd is pregnant and her child needs a father. Production Actress Liv Ullmann had to pay for her own plane ticket to audition for Edith Carlmar.

In 1881, the French government forcefully established a protectorate over Tunisia, which already was a colonial objective of the Kingdom of Italy.  Background   The Italo- Tunisian treaty of 1868  Tunisia had strategic importance for the European powers when it came to ownership and controlling the flow of trade across the Straits of Sicily. For that reason, Britain would support the French claim to the protectorate, denying Italy the opportunity to develop a stranglehold over shipping routes going through Tunisia and Sicily. (Italians had a long history in Tunisia, tracing back to the 16th Century. The Italian language was a lingua franca among merchants, due partially to the existing Italian-Jewish merchant community.) Italy had close relations with the Bey of Tunis, receiving its own capitulation in 1868 (it), giving it most favored nation status. The international accord granted Italians in Tunisia privileges already conceded to several Italian states pre-unification. Civil equality granted Italians freedom of commerce and extraterritoriality privileges for their factories. In fishing and navigation matters, they benefited from the same treatment as Tunisians. Moreover, the bey couldn't modify tariffs without preemptively consulting the Italian government.  French occupation  Benedetto Cairoli, the prime minister who suffered the \\"slap of Tunis\\" and had to resign from his position The first foreign policy objective of the second government led by Benedetto Cairoli was the colonisation of Tunisia, to which both France and Italy aspired. Cairoli, like Agostino Depretis before him, never considered to proceed to occupation, being generally hostile towards a militarist policyIn August and again in October 1876 Austro-Hungarian minister Gyula Andr√°ssy suggested to the Italian ambassador Robilant that Italy could have occupied Tunis, but Robilant rejected the invitation, and received comfort, along this line, by his Foreign Affairs minister: William L. Langer, The European Powers and the French Occupation of Tunis, 1878-1881, I, The American Historical Review, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Oct., 1925), p. 60.. However, they relied on a possible British opposition to an enlargement of the French sphere of influence in North Africa (while, if anything, London was hostile about a single country controlling the whole Strait of Sicily).Ren√© Albrecht-Carri√©, \\"Storia Diplomatica d'Europa 1815-1968\\", Editori Laterza, Bari-Roma, 1978, pp. 209-210. In the beginning of 1881 France decided to militarily intervene in Tunisia. The motivations of this action were summarised by Jules Ferry, who sustained that the Italians wouldn't have opposed it because some weeks before France had consented to a renewal of the Italo-French trade treaty, Italy was still paying the 600-million-lire debt contracted with France and primarily it was Italy that was politically isolated despite its tentatives towards Berlin and Vienna. Ferry confirmed that it was Otto von Bismarck to invite Paris to act in Tunisia precising that, in case of action, Germany wouldn't have raised objectionsAntonello Battaglia, I rapporti italo-francesi e le linee d'invasione transalpina (1859-1882), Nuova Cultura, Roma, 2013, pp. 41-42.. While in Italy there was a debate about the reliability of the news about a possible French action in Tunisia, a twenty-thousand-men expeditionary corp was preparing in Toulon. On May 3 a French contingent of two thousand men landed in Bizerte, followed on May 11 by the rest of the forcesAntonello Battaglia, I rapporti italo-francesi e le linee d'invasione transalpina (1859-1882), Nuova Cultura, Roma, 2013, p. 43.. The episode gave an ulterior confirm of the Italian political isolation, e rekindled the polemics that had followed the Congress of Berlin three years before. The events, in effect, demonstrated the irrealisability of the foreign policy of Cairoli and of Depretis, the impossibility of an alliance with France and the necessity of a rapprochement with Berlin and with Vienna, even if obtorto collo. However, such an inversion of the foreign policy of the last decade, couldn't be led by the same men, and Benedetto Cairoli resigned from office on May 29, 1881, thus avoiding that the Camera would openly distrust him; since then he de facto disappeared from the political scene.  Installation of the protectorate  Tunisia, located between Algeria to the west, French colony since 1830, and Cyrenaica and Tripolitania to the south-west, was then both a French and an Italian strategical objective. The bey's weakness, the intrigues of the ministers, like Mustapha Khaznadar and Mustapha Ben Isma√Øl, constant pression from European consuls, the bankruptcy of the State, become hostage of the creditors despite the effort of the reformator Hayreddin Pasha, opened doors to French occupation (hoped by German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to attract French attentions on the Mediterranean, and distract them from the Franco- German border).Antonello Battaglia, I rapporti italo-francesi e le linee d'invasione transalpina (1859-1882), Nuova Cultura, Roma, 2013, p. 36. On May 12, 1881 the Bardo Treaty was signed under the reign of Sadok Bey: with it the Tunisian State deprived itself of the active legation right, assigning to ¬´French diplomatic and consular agents in foreign countries [‚Ä¶] Tunisian protection and interests¬ª. The bey, in his turn, couldn't conclude any international act without informing France and obtaining an agreement first. But article 6 of the decree of June 9 allowed him to take part to conclusion of international treaties. Two years later, the conventions of La Marsa, signed on June 5, 1883, emptied the treaty of its content and violated the intern sovereignty of Tunisia forcing the bey to ¬´proceed to administrative, judiciary and financial reforms that the French government will retain useful¬ªCharles-Andr√© Julien, L'Afrique du Nord en marche, pagg. 48 e 52. Some decisions couldn't be taken without receiving the approval of the French general resident in Tunisia and of the French government general secretary. In the end, Europeans and Tunisians were equally represented (53 members for each community) in the Grand Council, a consultative assembly elected by universal suffrage with a double turn system.  Consequences  The European powers reacted differently depending on their interests: the United Kingdom hurried to occupy Egypt, while Germany and Austria-Hungary didn't express dissent about the French behavior. The Italian immigrants in Tunisia would have protested and caused serious difficulties to France. However, little at a time, the problem was solved and the immigrants could later opt for French nationality and benefit from the same vantages as French colonists. Italo- French relation dangerously fractured. Among the hypotheses weighed by the Italian military staff a possible invasion of the Italian Peninsula by French troops was not excluded.Antonello Battaglia, I rapporti italo-francesi e le linee d'invasione transalpina (1859-1882), Nuova Cultura, Roma, 2013, pp. 45-46.

In the same manner as other publishers of mystery novels such as Doubleday's The Crime Club, J. B. Lippincott & Co.'s Main Line Mysteries, Simon and Schuster's Inner Sanctum, and William Morrow & Co.'s Morrow Mysteries, Duell, Sloan & Pearce adopted the Bloodhound as a branding device to mark their house style and make future releases readily identifiable to readers. The imprint had its distinctive colophon of a Bloodhound medallion, stamped on each book's spine and title page. The Bloodhound imprint began in March of 1940 with the publication of The So Blue Marble, by Dorothy B. Hughes, and ceased publication in August of 1952 with the release of The Davidian Report, also by Hughes. In the intervening 13 years, The Bloodhound Imprint published approximately 112 titles by 34 writers. Scope and character Duell published an average of nine books per year under their Bloodhound Mysteries imprint. These included a variety of detective fiction sub-genres including suspense & psychological thrillers, locked room mysteries, police procedurals and hardboiled detective stories. The Bloodhound imprint published new works by respected crime novelists in their prime, such as Elizabeth Sanxay Holding, Anthony Boucher, and Lawrence Blochman. Yet the editors and reviewers at Duell, lead by Marie Rodell also specialised in detecting the talent in younger, unproven writers. The most notable example of this is Dorothy B. Hughes, who had only published two volumes of poetry before her first novel The So Blue Marble, launched both her career as a novelist and the Bloodhound imprint itself. Further examples include Lenore Glen Offord, Lewis Padgett, Veronica Parker Johns, and Sam Fuller, whose first crime novel, The Dark Page, was published by Duell in 1944 while he was still a corporal serving in the U.S. Army. The number of female mystery writers who prospered at Duell is also noteworthy. While female authors accounted for only slightly more than one third of the total writers published at Duell under the Bloodhound imprint, their collective critical and commercial success and the additional novels that brought forth ultimately accounted for 48 percent of the books published under the Bloodhound label (excluding anthologies). While The Bloodhound Mysteries imprint had remained at the vanguard of publishing original work by American mystery authors all throughout the 1940s, beginning in 1949 this decreased dramatically as Duell began instead acting as the U.S. publisher for recent works by well known British crime writers, including John Creasey (writing as Anthony Morton), James Hadley Chase, and Nicholas Bentley. The final year of the Bloodhound imprint saw only three titles published. In 1951 a partnership was struck between Duell and Little, Brown and Company of Boston, to handle the manufacturing, and promotion of all Duell, Sloan and Pearce titles. Thus the final releases have 'Duell Sloan & Pearce / Little, Brown' added to the Bloodhound Colophon. Regional Murder Series Beginning in 1944, Bloodhound Mysteries published New York Murders, the first in its regional murder anthology series. Each volume highlighted a series of true crime stories related to a specific American City, told by a selection of well known mystery writers familiar with the region. The regional murder series concluded with Vol 9 in 1948. Vol. 1 New York Murders (1944) Ted Collins, Editor Vol. 2 Chicago Murders (1945) Sewell Peaslee Wright, Editor Vol. 3 Denver Murders (1946) Lee Casey, Editor.

She specializes on human impacts on aquatic ecosystem function, with a focus on coastal Great Lake ecosystems. Tuchman is dedicated to raising public awareness about issues of global climate change and education. Her dedication is shown through her thirty years of educating students in environmental sciences at Loyola University Chicago. She founded the Institute of Environmental Sustainability on Loyola University's campus and is a driver of environmental change and progress in the Chicago area.  Early life and education  Tuchman grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan where she was raised for a love of the outdoors by two amateur ecologist parents. Time spent in nature, exploring streams and lakes, led to her passion for aquatic ecosystems that carried out through her education and career. Tuchman went on to study biology and ecology at Central Michigan University to then earn a Masters of Science in aquatic ecology. From there she attended the University of Louisville to earn a Ph.D in aquatic ecology in 1988 with advisor, R. Jan Stevenson. Her dissertation was titled: ‚ÄúEffects of different intensities and frequencies of disturbance by snail herbivory on periphyton succession.‚Äù  Career and research  Tuchman's research focuses on human impacts to aquatic ecosystems with three main lines of research: effects of invasive species on coastal ecosystems, effects of Greenhouse gases on stream ecosystem food webs, and the effects of contaminants and pharmaceuticals on streams and lakes. She is currently examining the impacts of invasive species, Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail) and Phragmites australis (common reed) in the Great lakes coastal wetlands. Her team is now experimenting with economic and sustainable harvesting methods to remove the invasive plant species and use them as a biomass, as the cattail is high in cellulose-carbon- great for burning. In 1988 she became an instructor in the biology department at Loyola University Chicago. Over 30 years of research, Tuchman has been awarded over $4.5 million in federal grants, she has authored or co-authored over 50 manuscripts and book chapters, and mentored or co-mentored over 100 undergraduate and graduate students in her lab. In 2002 she served as a program officer for the Ecosystem Studies Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) to overseeing a $13 million dollar budget and two programs, Ecosystem Studies and Coupled Natural and Human Systems. After serving at the NSF, she returned to Loyola as Associate Provost for Research and Centers. This position gave her headway for the discussion and proposing of the idea to make a more energy efficient and sustainable campus and ultimately establish the Institute of Environmental Sustainability. Tuchman has been a leader in the efforts to re-imagine Loyola's campus as green certified, as well as incorporating environmental education in the core curriculum for all undergraduate students. In 2016, Loyola University Chicago was named one of the seventh greenest universities in the nation according to Sierra Magazine. The Institute of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola has hosted an annual Climate Change Conference since 2015. Tuchman believes that Jesuit universities can play an important role in the development of incorporating environmental education into higher education across the board because climate change is tied to issues of social justice. From 2008 to 2010, Tuchman served as president-elect and then president of the Society for Freshwater Science.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Tailoring business G. A. Zink & Sons was established in 1895 at 112 Oxford Street by Gustav A. Zink. The purpose-built premises at 56 Oxford Street were built around the first half of 1912 on a new block formed by the widening of Oxford Street. The building was later substantially renovated by his son, Frank, with a new shopfront and entrance porch designed by the shop fitting firm of H. & E. Sidgreaves and installed during the first half of 1938. The business has continued at the 1912 location over several generations, experiencing booms in business in the interwar period and following World War II. Now Zink and Sons, it continues to be operated by the Zink family. Description A three-storey Federation commercial building, with a symmetrical Inter War Functionalist shopfront with recessed central porch that has a polychrome terrazzo floor. The display windows on either side are surrounded by black Vitrolite relieved by two fine stainless steel strips. The name of the store is located in the hamper and consists of large individual stainless steel lettering in a stylised \\"modern\\" letter face. Other lettering includes the street number mounted at the top of the display windows. The ground floor and first floor contains a large amount of early fabric, much of it dating from the 1920s including shelving, cabinetry, stairs and balustrades, etched glazing, partitions and leadlight glazing. Significance No 56 Oxford Street is part of an architecturally consistent group of buildings that were the result of the resumption and widening of Oxford Street between Whitlam and Taylor Square. It is an exceptional and rare example of an Inter-War Functionalist style shopfront that is substantially intact, while the fa√ßade of the building at first and second floors incorporates finely detailed signage from the Federation era that is fully integrated with the fabric of the fa√ßade. The ground and first floor interior, despite modifications is a remarkably intact and rare example of a purpose designed 1920s shop interior. It is the only building on the northern side of Oxford Street that was purpose designed for a specific tenancy, GA Zink and Co, which has retained this original connection.

A facial tattoo is a tattoo located on the bearer's face or head. Considered taboo and socially unacceptable in many cultures, as well as considered extreme in body art, this style and placement of tattoo has emerged in certain subcultures in recent years. This is due to the continuing acceptance of tattoos and the emergence of hip-hop culture popularizing styles such as the teardrop tattoo. Artists such as Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, Gucci Mane and, in recent years Post Malone, XXXTentacion, Lil Peep, Lil Skies, Lil Pump, Lil Xan and 6ix9ine contribute to its popularity.  History  In Ancient Rome, slaves who fled or attempted escape from their masters would frequently be branded on their foreheads or tattooed against their will. These tattoos portrayed the crimes committed and were a punishment because of the inability to cover up a tattoo on the forehead. As the Roman world entered late antiquity, extreme Christian sects began to use former-slave forehead tattoos as religious symbols and signs of strength. Religious facial and head tattoos were not socially unacceptable within these circles though in the greater Roman mainstream there was still an association between face tattoos and former slavery. In 315/316 CE, an edict outlawed facial tattoos and facial branding/tattooing for slaves. Medieval pilgrims would frequently get tattoos whilst visiting the Holy Land, including the occasional face tattoo. Crusaders may have got facial tattoos as permanent proof of their participation in the Crusades, although this is unknown. In ancient Vietnam, face tattooing was considered as a form of punishment. In 1042, King Ly Thai Tong issued the Hinh Thu, or Criminal Law, in which criminals were caned or tattooed 20 to 50 characters on their faces.  Ethnic practices  Inuit woman with facial tattoo Face tattoo is traditionally practiced by many ethnic groups worldwide, such as the Inuit, the Maoris, peoples of Northeast India such as the Apatani, the Chin of Myanmar and the Derung people of southwestern China.  Inuit and Alaska Natives Facial tattoos were practiced among Inuit women, but this practice was suppressed by missionaries. In the 21st century, there was a revival of traditional facial tattooing among Indigenous Arctic women.  Chin people  Chin woman with face tattoo Southern Chin women were also tattooed on their faces with closely set lines using blue pigments, ostensibly to discourage them from being kidnapped by invaders. Chin women were typically tattooed between the ages of 15 and 20. The practice has quickly disappeared, as it was banned in the 1960s by Burma's totalitarian regime and it was discouraged by Christian missionaries. Mro women also wore tattoos in the form of small marks or stars on the cheek, forehead or breast.  Ainu  The Ainu people of northern Japan and parts of Russia, including Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka Krai, have a practice of facial tattooing exclusive to women, in which a smile is inked around the mouth to prevent spirits from entering the body through the mouth. This form of tattooing also serves a secondary purpose of showing maturity.  Modern day  Face tattoos have been considered socially unacceptable and \\"outrageous\\" and generally will prohibit the tattooed person from finding employment and results in discrimination in many cases. Most tattoo artists will attempt to dissuade clients from getting a facial tattoo, and in some cases may outright refuse to do a facial tattoo, but this refusal is usually done when the client has few tattoos collected on the rest of their body. Due to how taboo tattoos were originally, they are often associated with criminality. Many gangs and criminal organizations mark members with tattoos, including visible areas such as the face, head, and neck. Members may get excessive facial tattoos as a form of intimidation.https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context;=jj_etds This started in California in the 1980s before becoming widespread. A 2013 study published in Psychology, Public Policy, and Law concluded that face tattoos often lead to bias in the jury and more frequent convictions. Many ex- convicts also have facial tattoos, due to prison tattooing, and the culture of prison tattoos includes the indoctrination of people within the prison populace into gangs, which often require tattoos to show aggression. These tattoos include teardrop tattoos indicating that the bearer has either taken a life or lost someone close to them; a five-point crown, a common Latin Kings symbol; and a number of different facial tattoos alluding to Nazism in the Aryan Brotherhood and Salvadorian culture in MS-13. In the mid 2000s, the trend of getting a facial tattoo emerged among celebrities, starting with Mike Tyson's large tribal tattoo in 2003 and the ascension of rap music from the underground to the mainstream. This allowed artists with a criminal background and face tattoos to become well known, including Birdman, Lil Wayne and The Game. Lil Wayne's excessive tattooing of his face created a minor trend that he helped pioneer inspiring rappers like Gucci Mane and then-chart topper Little small Wayne to get facial tattoos.  Hip-hop culture  The influence of artists like Lil Wayne getting face tattoos wasn't fully realized until the mid-2010s with the resurgence of trap music and the \\"SoundCloud rap\\" scene. Artists such as Lil Peep, Travis Scott, 21 Savage and Migos all have facial tattoos and emerged between 2014 and 2016, soon entering the mainstream and the Billboard Hot 100. The facial tattoos are often used by these artists as motivation to limit attaining meaningful employment, leading them to focus entirely on their music career. This, alongside with the entrance of hip-hop culture and black culture into the mainstream has led to face tattoos increasing in popularity. The insurgence of many trap artists in the 2010s increased the popularity of face tattoos. Though discrimination remains in the fashion world for models who have facial tattoos, generally models with face tattoos of the brand they're modeling for, such as having a Chanel logo under your eye, is becoming acceptable.  In professional sports  In 2003, American heavyweight professional boxer Mike Tyson received his infamous face tattoo. The iconic tribal design then went on to define his public image as the 'baddest man on the planet'.

Both the substation and the underground conveniences were designed by Robert Hargreave Brodrick and built from 1904 to 1907, with Owen Ridge & Sons building the substation and G. D. Getherson the underground public conveniences. The property is owned by City of Sydney. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 July 2004.  History  With its elevated position over the city, the Darlinghurst area has been called Woolloomooloo Heights, Eastern Hill and Henrietta Town. In the 1820s, Governor Ralph Darling renamed the suburb in honour of his wife, Eliza Darling.Crosson, 2013 By 1800 several large windmills were situated on the heights of this area, using its stiff breezes to grind much-needed flour from grain. The area began its suburban life under the name \\"Henrietta Town\\", being called after Elizabeth Macquarie, whose second name was Henrietta. At that time it was an Aboriginal reserve. Loyalties changed with Governors when Darling took office, changing its name to Darlinghurst in honour of his popular wife. \\"Hurst\\" is an old English word for a wooded hill. By the late 1830s Darlinghurst had become a densely populated residential suburb lined with rows of small terraces and grand houses. The gilt went off the suburb when Darlinghurst Gaol, designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis was built in 1841. It was not its style, but the significance of its erection that was the reason for the decline in Darlinghurst's popularity. Governor Brisbane had reserved 3.5 acres on Sydney's outskirts for a new gaol to replace the earlier lock-up in George Street. In 1823 a stockade was erected. Convicts quarried the stone from nearby William Street and hauled it to the hill top, where other convict gangs shaped up the blocks by hand. The completed enclosure was known as Woolloomooloo Stockade. Construction commenced in 1836 and was complete by 1841. Prisoners from George Street prison were marched in chains to Darlinghurst to the jeers and catcalls of the watching crowd. The first public hanging took place at the new gaol on 29 October 1841. Darlinghurst Courthouse, neighbouring the gaol, was constructed in the 1840s, with later additions by the 1880s. By this time the area now known as Taylor Square had become a busy transport interchange for bus and steam tram services. In 1883 a public urinal occupied the site at Taylor Square. In 1885 a steel structure was erected over the urinals to provide a platform for the elevated saltwater tanks. It is believed that these saltwater tanks were used for street cleaning. This early technique of public sanitation provided the rudimentary predecessor to the purpose-designed Underground Conveniences. On 16 October 1896 the Municipal Council of Sydney Electric Lighting Bill was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, establishing the right for Sydney Municipal Council to light the streets and to generate and supply electricity to the residents of the City of Sydney. The construction of Electricity Substation No. 6 was completed in 1904. It is the most intact of the first five substations built by Sydney Municipal Council that brought electricity to the streets, homes and businesses of Sydney city for the first time. At 5pm on 8 July 1904 the Municipal Council of Sydney's Electricity Undertaking switched on their supply system and the city streets from Circular Quay to Redfern and from Hyde Park to Darling Harbour were lit by electric lights for the first time. Electricity quickly became an exciting new commodity which the Council's Electricity Undertaking were trying to sell to both the local councils and private customers. In continuous operation from 1904 to 1993, the Substation building marks the commencement of the major technological transformation of the twentieth century associated with the development of the modern city and state. In response to the public health and safety concerns, particularly after the outbreak of the bubonic plague in Sydney in 1900, Sydney Municipal Council undertook to build one underground men's convenience a year from 1901 to 1911. The Underground Men's Conveniences at Taylor Square was erected in 1907, replacing the public urinals and saltwater tank, and was the sixth of the underground conveniences to be constructed in Sydney. Together, the construction of these purpose-designed, high quality, Civic buildings within the public domain formed part of the introduction of the City Beautiful movement into Sydney that drove the complete remodelling of Oxford Street and associated creation of Taylor Square in 1907. The public space, Civic buildings and streets were remodelled to provide for the introduction of the State's first electric tram and to improve city design and traffic movement throughout Victorian Sydney. While the Substation provided the electricity for the newly introduced electric tram, the conveniences serviced the large volume of tram commuters. The City Beautiful movement was evident throughout Sydney with the construction of a total of twelve ft these purpose-designed Public Underground Conveniences located in the public domain of the City, often associated with the tram lines, of which the Taylor Square Conveniences remain the only extant example. In 1938 after years of debate on a \\"suitable\\" location for equivalent female conveniences and in response to active petitioning from the Women's Progressive Association, Council modified the southern end of the existing Substation to accommodate women's conveniences. These were the first public toilets provided for women at Taylor Square, some 55 years after the first male public urinal was provided at Taylor Square. Council policy was that women's conveniences \\"should, when possible, form part of a block of buildings. If it is only possible to have them in independent structures then they should be combined with a small shop such as a florist, tearooms, Parcels Office etc.\\"City of Sydney Archives, CRS 34/4356/20 The allocation of a Public Ladies' Convenience in this town square, and the manner and timeframe in which this was achieved, symbolises the evolution in social attitudes to the public role of women, as well as the growing activism of feminist groups in Sydney during the early 20th Century. The first female public conveniences in Sydney were provided in 1910 at Hyde Park, then at Railway Square and Circular Quay. The survival of these other early examples has not been established. The conveniences were closed to public access in 1988 and the substation decommissioned in 1993.  Description  Substation No. 6 The Substation has a rectangular plan and is constructed in load bearing face brick with rusticated sandstone lintels, arches and base coursing, and is dressed with sandstone top coursing, window sills, and window heads. Brickwork string coursing and corbels are featured near the parapet, which steps up towards the southern end. The parapet features a bullnose course, projecting course and brick end capping. The external brickwork reveals the former outline of the 1904 sandstone buttresses and freestone copings. The 1928 parapet line is also evident. The 1938 Art Deco southern wall to the stair to the women's conveniences remains. The floor level of the Substation is located below the pavement level and is accessed via a street stair from Bourke Street. The landing is edged in decorative steel. Access to an internal mezzanine platform is also available from the pavement level on the eastern side of the substation via a single leaf door. The western and eastern elevations have two groups of three timber arched windows symmetrically placed about central doors. To the north, the three separate openings, of similar arched shape, contain painted steel horizontal louvres behind fixed metal screens. To the south the windows, which originally mirrored the north, have been bricked up and the central window replaced with a door opening for the women's conveniences. The steel rainwater heads and downpipes from the 1928 alterations and additions have been retained, as has the 1938 \\"Ladies\\" signs. Internally, the ground floor of the Substation is free of internal partitions. The upper level floor and walls are supported on steel beams situated above the substation wall. The ground floor is concrete with trenches running along the eastern, western and southern walls with metal cover plates. The walls are rendered and painted brickwork. The piers still exist on the western wall. Underground Men's Conveniences The Edwardian style Underground Men's Conveniences are characterised externally by a wrought iron fence and gates, with Art Nouveau detailing that are set on a painted sandstone base, and a central masonry podium (the air vent) located at the centre of the curved stairs, which originally supported a decorative metal vent capping. The Conveniences are accessed from pavement level via two separate interlocking curved staircases that encircle a central vent. Two masonry piers flank the two entry gates to the staircases. Internally, the main subterranean structure is enclosed in a brickwork cavity with a curved concrete ceiling supported by exposed steel beams. The symmetrical plan of the underground conveniences is arranged around the circular core containing the pair of interlocking curved stairs and air vent, and comprises five toilet cubicles and two ceramic urinal stalls. An attendant's room is located under the stairs and air vent, and features a low arched entrance and original arched timber door with multi paned glazing. The internal walls of the conveniences feature white florite glass tiles and ceramic tiles frieze with art Nouveau green floral patterns at a high level, which have been painted. Much of the original joinery, including timber framed doors, timber framed louvres and moulded timber architraves, has survived. Modern services, including fluorescent lights, electrical cabling and mechanical ventilation ducts have also been introduced to the internal space. Women's Conveniences The women's conveniences are located at the southern end at the first floor level. Much of the original partitioning, joinery and sanitary fixtures have been retained. The toilets remain in the cubicles along the western wall with wash basins located along the northern wall. The entrance is lined with cream square ceramic tiles, the floor covered in linoleum with red skirting. The wired glass skylights are patterned with metal ventilation grilles to the ceiling.  Condition  As at 27 November 2003: The Conveniences were in good structural condition. However, there has been leaking though the roof which requires a new membrane. The steel beams supporting the roof show signs of rusting which should be cleaned of paint and rust and structural adequacy assessed prior to recoating the beams. Some tiling has been damaged. The Substation were generally in good structural condition except for the two end gable parapets which have substantial cracking that requires attention. Additional research and investigation is required to gauge the archaeological potential of the site. There is a high level of original integrity of both structures.  Modifications and dates  * 1904: Electrical Substation No.6 constructed (originally known as Substation No.1). * 1905: Temporary staircase of Substation replaced with permanent iron staircase. * 1907: Underground (male) Public Conveniences constructed. * 1928/1938: Saltwater tanks removed prior to this time.

Heritage listing  The Underground Public Conveniences and Substation No. 6 are a rare and distinctive group of public utilities from early-twentieth century Sydney. They are of State heritage significance within the aesthetic, historic, associations, technical, social, representative and rarity criteria, as a group and individually. The Taylor Square group contains the oldest, surviving underground public toilet in Sydney (built in 1907), and the most intact of the first Electric Substations of New South Wales (built in 1904) that first brought sanitation reform and electricity to the public streets of Sydney City and New South Wales. As the oldest extant examples in Sydney, they a rare and lasting record of the major reforms and achievements of the early 20th Century in sanitation, public health, technology and City design, which transformed Sydney and the other city centres of Australia into modern cities. The only other known examples of purpose-designed public underground toilets in Australia from this era of public health reform are located in the inner city of Melbourne and have been identified as nationally significant. Both buildings are fine examples of Edwardian Civic architecture, designed by the prominent City Surveyor and Architect, Robert Hargreave Brodrick, and are landmarks of Taylor Square. Together, these fine Civic buildings have formed part of the identity of Taylor Square since its creation in the early 1900s, and are associated with the State's first electric tram service that once ran through this intersection, a key tram junction at the time. The quality, design and function of these buildings also represents the introduction of the City Beautiful movement into Sydney during the early 20th Century, a movement that drove the complete remodelling of this town square and Oxford Street to improve urban design and traffic movement within Sydney. These Taylor Square buildings have provided the constant setting to developments of national significance in Australian society, as the symbolic birthplace and growth of gay pride activism in Australia since the first gay pride march commenced at Taylor Square in 1978, and as a continuing focus of the annual Mardi Gras, an internationally recognised event. The group also contains the first public female toilet of Taylor Square, built in 1938 within the Substation building, demonstrating the growing activism of feminist groups in Sydney and the changing public role of women during the early 20th Century. Taylor Square Substation No.6 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 July 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Underground Public Conveniences and Substation No. 6 are significant as a rare and distinctive group of public utilities established in the inner City of early-twentieth century Sydney. As a group, the Underground Public Conveniences and Substation No. 6 provide a rare and lasting record of the major reforms and achievements of the early 20th Century in sanitation, public health, technology and City design, which transformed Sydney and the other city centres of Australia into modern cities. The buildings are remnant evidence of the introduction of the State's first electric tram that once ran through this intersection, and the major tram junction at Taylor Square, as the construction of the substation and conveniences was associated with servicing the new electric tram lines and commuters. The isolated location of the buildings within the original roadway (formerly alongside the tram lines), their function, quality, scale and age provide evidence of these former tram lines and junction, and their important role at the time as a major form of transportation. The provision of purpose-designed underground toilets in the public domain to replace the former public urinal in this location, demonstrates the changing importance of public health and sanitation during this era, in response to the public health crisis in Sydney from the outbreak of bubonic plague in 1900. Built in 1907, the Underground Public Conveniences are the oldest extant underground toilets in Sydney, of which there were originally twelve. They are also possibly the oldest extant public toilets in Sydney. Electricity Substation No. 6, constructed in 1904, is one of the first five substations built by Sydney Municipal Council that brought electricity to the streets, homes and businesses of Sydney city for the first time in 1904. It is the most intact of the two surviving examples of these first substations. In continuous operation from 1904 to 1993, the building marks the commencement of the major technological transformation of the twentieth century associated with the development of the modern city and state. The Substation also contains the first Public Ladies Conveniences allocated in Taylor Square, built in 1938, 55 years after the first male public urinal was allocated in Taylor Square, largely due to the petitions of the early feminist group, the Women's Progressive Association. The allocation of a Public Ladies' Convenience in this town square, and the manner and timeframe in which this was achieved, symbolises the evolution in social attitudes to the public role of women, as well as the growing activism of feminist groups in Sydney during the early 20th Century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Substation and Underground Conveniences have provided the constant setting to nationally significant developments in Australian society, as the birthplace and development of gay pride activism in Australia since the first gay pride march commenced at Taylor Square in 1978. This important association of the place with the gay and lesbian community has continued, as it remains a focus of the annual Mardi Gras, a highly popular and internationally recognised event. The place has a well-established profile for this association not only in Australia but internationally. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Electricity Substation No. 6 and the Underground Conveniences have been landmarks of Taylor Square since its formation in the early Twentieth Century, identifying one of Sydney City's defining public spaces, major thoroughfares and processional route into and out of the City. The buildings are fine examples of Edwardian Civic architecture, with Interwar Art Deco overlays, both originally designed by the prominent City Surveyor and Architect, Robert Hargreave Brodrick. The quality and design of the buildings represent the introduction of the ideals of the City Beautiful movement into Sydney to improve City design and traffic movement at the time, which drove the complete remodelling of Oxford Street and creation of Taylor Square in 1907. Together, the buildings contribute to one of the most intact Victorian and Edwardian streetscapes in Sydney, and reinforce the Civic precinct on the northern side of Taylor Square relating to the significant Darlinghurst Courthouse and the Sydney Municipal Council buildings along Oxford Street (1907‚Äì16). The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The two Civic buildings mark the town square that holds important associations with the gay and lesbian community, as the centre for the recognised homosexual community since the 1960s, and as the birthplace and development of gay pride activism in Australia. Taylor Square provided the starting point of the first gay pride march in 1978, formed the focus of subsequent rallies, demonstrations and confrontations with Police, and continues to play an important role in the annual Mardi Gras, a highly popular and internationally recognised event. The substation and underground conveniences are socially significant as a community meeting place of Taylor Square and Oxford Street, and are important to the community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Substation No. 6 retains its ability to demonstrate its original use and design intent and has considerable potential to yield information about the earliest operation of electrical services and provision of electrical supply to Sydney. Evidence of the earlier salt water tanks that were originally located on the site above the substation are also retained, which provide information on the early techniques of street cleaning, sanitation and public health. These tanks provided the rudimentary predecessor to the Underground Public Conveniences where the salt water was used for street cleaning over the 1883 public urinal. The underground toilets, replacing the former public urinal and salt water tanks, demonstrate the advancements in sanitation technology in the public domain of Sydney during the early 20th century, as a result the public health crisis of the outbreak of the Bubonic Plague in 1900. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Underground Public Conveniences are rare in Australia as the oldest extant underground toilets in Sydney. The other known examples of public underground toilets from the same era of public health reform are in the inner-City of Melbourne and have been assessed as nationally significant. The Underground Public Conveniences are rare in the State as the only surviving example of the first group of public underground toilets in the inner-City of Sydney (of which there were originally twelve). Of this first group, the Taylor Square toilet was also the only one to feature interlocking curved staircases. Substation No. 6 is rare in the State as the most intact of the first substations constructed in the State, and which was in continuous operation from 1904 to 1993. Together, these rare early examples of Civic utilities provide evidence of the major technological achievements of the early 20th century that transformed Australia's city centres into modern cities. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The group of buildings at Taylor Square represent fine examples of Edwardian Civic architecture, which together demonstrate the City Beautiful movement to improve urban design of the public domain and traffic movement that transformed parts of Sydney during the early 20th Century. As the oldest most- intact examples of their type, the buildings also demonstrate the major technological achievements and reforms of the early 20th Century in sanitation, public health and power supply that transformed Sydney into a modern City. The buildings are landmarks of the Taylor Square precinct that is and has been held in high esteem by the homosexual community since the 1960s, representing the centre of the recognised gay community since this time, representing the birthplace of gay pride activism in Australia in 1978, and the development of these origins into the internationally recognised and highly popular Mardi Gras.

Zagorski lured the two men into a wooded hunting ground under the pretense of selling them 100 lb (45 kg) of marijuana ‚Äì before shooting them and slitting their throats. The state of Tennessee made multiple attempts to execute Zagorski over the course of almost a decade. Ultimately, he became the first inmate legally executed by electrocution in almost six years in the United States on November 1, 2018.  Background  Edmund Zagorski was born in Michigan on December 27, 1954, and spent most of his childhood in Tecumseh. He grew up in an impoverished family, suffered from both an unnamed learning disability and a stutter, and did not finish high school. By the time of the murders that put him on death row, he had trained to become a ship captain.  Murders of Dotson and Porter  Zagorski first met John Dale Dotson (1947/48‚Äì1983), a logger from Hickman County, Tennessee, on April 5, 1983 at a trout farm. Zagorski introduced himself to Dotson and his wife Marsha under the guise of being a mercenary based in Central America named Jesse Lee Hardin. Zagorski convinced Dotson that he would be able to sell as much as 100 pounds of marijuana for around $25,000 as early as April 21. Following this, the two scheduled a meeting in a wooded hunting ground in Robertson County for 6:00 pm on Saturday, April 23, 1983. Before he left to meet Zagorski on April 23, Dotson was described by his wife Marsha as \\"at least somewhat hesitant\\" and allegedly asked her to call a friend if he failed to return that night. After leaving, he met his friend James \\"Jimmy\\" Porter (1950/51‚Äì1983) at Porter's tavern, near the arranged meeting location. Dotson had a change of clothes, a backpack and a revolver. The two men promptly left in Porter's truck to meet Zagorski. At around 5:30 pm, the owner of the trout farm where Zagorski and Dotson first met heard gunshots coming from the area where he knew the three men had arranged to meet. However, little action was taken as gunshots were common in the area due to deer hunting. Almost two weeks later, on May 6, the bodies of Dotson and Porter were found in that same wooded area. The bodies had decomposed quickly, in part due to a burgeoning heat wave; however it was concluded that both men had been shot and their throats had been slit. Ballistics tests matched a bullet casing found at the scene to a gun owned by Zagorski.  Arrest, interrogation, and trial  In late April, days after the murders, Zagorski arrived at a friend's house in Ohio. The friend in question observed that Zagorski was in possession of numerous items belonging to Dotson and Porter, including Porter's red Datsun truck, as well as a large amount of money. Zagorski was ultimately arrested on May 26, 1983 following a shootout with Ohio police, during which he shot a number of officers, before he himself was shot, subdued, and arrested. Zagorski offered a confession to the murders on July 17, 1983, nearly two months after his arrest, on the condition that he could dictate the terms and date of his execution; a death sentence was mandatory for a capital murder conviction in Tennessee at the time. This came during a heat wave in the area, as well as that Zagorski was placed in solitary confinement in an unventilated 8 √ó 8-foot (2.44 √ó 2.44-m) cell despite a court order forbidding it. During the trial, no defense witnesses were called and no evidence was presented by the defense team during the penalty portion of the trial before the jury returned to deliver its verdict. Zagorski was convicted of murdering Dotson and Porter on March 2, 1984, and on March 27, 1984, he was sentenced to death by electrocution.  Litigation and execution  On February 15, 2018, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery requested that the Tennessee Supreme Court (TNSC) set execution dates for 8 death row inmates, including Zagorski, to take place on or before June 1, 2018. On March 15, the TNSC responded by denying the specific request made by Slatery and by setting execution dates for two of the eight inmates, and Zagorski was scheduled for execution on October 11, 2018, which was at least his third since arrival on death row, while another inmate, David Miller, was scheduled to be executed on December 6. Miller was also executed by electrocution as scheduled. On October 5, 2018, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam refused to intervene in Zagorski's case. On October 8, the TNSC also refused to stay Zagorski's execution on the grounds of a challenge to the state's lethal injection protocol. Mere hours after the TNSC refused to hear Zagorski's case on October 8, 2018, Zagorski requested that he be executed with the state's electric chair, which had last been used over a decade earlier in the September 2007 execution of Daryl Holton. The Tennessee Department of Correction refused the request on October 9, pointing out that Zagorski had waited too long to make such a request and had been asked whether he wanted to reconsider the method of his execution six months in advance. On October 10, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Zagorski's execution on the grounds of ineffective counsel. In addition, on the morning of October 11, Judge Aleta A. Trauger, a judge serving on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, stayed Zagorski's execution pending appeals of a ruling in a lawsuit against the Department of Correction regarding the state's lethal injection protocol. Finally, shortly before Zagorski was to be executed, Governor Haslam granted a 10-day executive reprieve (until October 21) with the purpose of allowing the Department of Correction to prepare the electric chair. Both of the stays granted by federal courts were overturned by the United States Supreme Court on October 12. On October 22, 2018, one day after the reprieve granted by Haslam expired, the TNSC reset Zagorski's execution date to November 1. By October 29, Judge Trauger had rejected all appeals filed to her court by Zagorski's legal team, but granted a restraining order that same day requiring that Zagorski's lawyer, Kelley Henry, would be allowed access to a phone during Zagorski's execution. The state agreed to honour this caveat at around midday on November 1. In addition, a series of appeals were denied by the Sixth Circuit on October 30 and 31. At around 4 pm on November 1, 2018, Zagorski ate a final meal of pickled ham hock and pig tails: he had previously rejected a special last meal ahead of his October 11 execution date. Finally, minutes before 7 pm that same day, the United States Supreme Court refused to grant Zagorski a stay of execution. Zagorski was executed by electrocution on Thursday, November 1, 2018, at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, being pronounced dead at 7:26 pm CDT (12:26 am UTC).Tennessee executes Edmund Zagorski by electric chair Zagorski was the first inmate legally electrocuted in nearly six years since the January 2013 execution of Robert Gleason in Virginia, the second inmate executed in Tennessee since executions resumed there on August 9, 2018, and, with the electrocution of David Earl Miller on December 6, 2018, the first of two inmates electrocuted in Tennessee in 2018.

With principal research facilities located in the United States Orbital Segment of the International Space Station (ISS), the Laboratory conducts research in life sciences, physical sciences, technology development and remote sensing for a broad range of academic, government and commercial users. Of the 270 payloads that the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) has sent to the ISS, 176 have been for commercial companies including Merck, Novartis, Eli Lilly and Company, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, and Procter & Gamble.  History  International Space Station after undocking of STS-132 The ISS has been an operational science platform since the installation of the Destiny module in February 2001. The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the US segment of ISS as a National Lab in order to ‚Äú‚Ä¶help improve life on Earth, foster relationships among NASA, other Federal agencies, and the private sector, and advance STEM education through utilization of unique ISS Capabilities in microgravity.‚Äù In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress directed NASA to choose a not-for-profit entity to manage the US National Lab. In August 2011, NASA entered into a 10-year agreement with CASIS in order to fully develop the ISS US segment as a National Laboratory. In July 2017, NASA extended the contract with CASIS to manage the US National Lab through September 2024.  Facilities  Scientific research facilities on the National Lab provide infrastructure and equipment to conduct experiments in microgravity. Facilities typically remain on station for extended periods of time to support repeat and long-term research opportunities. Many facilities are managed by private sector companies. Facility managers support use of the on-station equipment for investigations from organizations other than the hardware's developer and owner, validating a business model for in-orbit commercial services at lower costs. The National Lab now has 14 commercially operated laboratory facilities managed by eight companies, including two newly installed facilities in FY18 and one new facility manager. Additive Manufacturing Facility: By utilizing a 3D printer, this manufacturing facility can perform station maintenance, build tools, upgrade and install new hardware and repair sections of the ISS in case of an emergency. Its manufacturing capabilities also support a wide range of commercial interests on the ISS. ADvanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP): This thermally controlled facility accommodates experiments in cell technology, model organisms, multiphase fluids, solution chemistry, separation science, microencapsulation, and crystal growth. Bone Densitometer: This facility provides bone density scanning of mice during space flight, which helps researchers study human bone disease. Materials ISS Experiment Flight Facility (MISSE-FF): a facility that tests materials, coatings, and components in space. Experiments will show how materials react to ultraviolet radiation (UV), atomic oxygen (AO), ionizing radiation, ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), charged particles, thermal cycles, electromagnetic radiation, and micro-meteoroids. Industries that benefit from testing include Advanced Materials, Automotive, Aeronautics, Energy, Space (flight hardware, astronaut clothing and protection), Transportation and Micro-meteoroid On-Orbit Debris (MMOD). Multi- use Variability-g Platform (MVP): a facility that provides artificial gravity, temperature, humidity, oxygen and carbon dioxide control when testing in space. It supports research in Drosophila, C. Elegans, cultured cells, plants, aquatic animals, protein crystallization, tissue chips, and functional gravity studies. MUSES (Multi User System for Earth Sensing): This facility hosts earth-viewing instruments, such as high-resolution digital cameras and hyperspectral imagers, and provides precision pointing. The data gathered from this facility can be used for: Maritime Domain Awareness, Agricultural Awareness, Food Security, Disaster Response, Air Quality, Oil/Gas Exploration, Fire Detection, and Heritage Preservation. NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer: a device that is designed to deploy satellites, or CubeSats, into orbit from the ISS. A CubeSat is a stackable, modular, ground loaded launch case that can accommodate up to 6.5U. The CubeSat deployer system can mechanically and electrically isolate CubeSats from the ISS, cargo resupply vehicles, and ISS crew. NanoRacks External Platform: Installed on the outside of the ISS, this is the first external commercial research capability for sensor, material and electronic testing that can be retrieved and returned to Earth. It delivers research results concerning biological testing, sensor target testing, satellite communications components testing, power systems testing, and materials testing. NanoRacks Internal Platform (Nanolab): Measuring 10 cm by 10 cm by 10 cm, this is a box unit that flies a researcher's project to the ISS. This miniaturized hardware has a circuit board that activates the experiment, turns it off and can be functioned for other activities. NanoLabs are plugged into the facility's platform using a USB port, allowing data and power to flow. NanoRacks PlateReader: a laboratory instrument designed to detect biological, chemical or physical events of samples in microtiter plates. Microplate readers are widely used in research, drug discovery, bioassay validation, quality control and manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry. It also has temperature control capability, making long-term incubation of samples possible, such as measuring microbial growth or monitoring gene expression. Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL): can be used for experiments in the life, physical and material sciences with a focus on supporting research of biological systems and processes. Microorganisms, small organisms, animal cells, tissue cultures, and small plants are studied in this lab. Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems (STaARS): a research platform with the capacity to support physical science, advanced biotechnology, and life science research by providing reliable temperature control, controllable experiment hardware, and rapid flight access. Findings impact pharmaceutical, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, biofuel, and discovery sciences. TangoLab-1: a fully automated, multipurpose, reconfigurable general research facility on the ISS. TangoLab-2: a fully automated, multipurpose, reconfigurable general research facility on the ISS. The primary difference between TangoLab-1 and TangoLab-2 is an upgraded fan system which allows for a greater heat rejection capability. This enables research with greater power draw and lower temperature requirements.  Research   Life Sciences  All living organisms on Earth are continually influenced by gravitational forces on both macro and molecular levels. The microgravity conditions in space induce changes in DNA regulation, expression of genes and cell structure and function. Understanding the impact of gravitational force on living systems and their biochemical processes advances research in the fields of biology, genetics, health care, medicine, microbiology, plant and crop sciences, nanotechnology, and pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine.  Research examples  = Stem Cell Research = Stem cells It has been shown that stem cells, the master cells that produce all organ and tissue cell types, may grow faster in microgravity as compared to cells grown conventionally in gravity. The conditions in space also allow for the formation of three- dimensional tissues coupled with the differentiation of stem-cells into different cell types that better mimic the functions of tissues and organ systems. One scientist is experimenting with human stem cells in space to improve treatments for stroke victims. The goal is to ‚Äúexpand the population of stem cells that will induce regeneration of neurons and blood vessels in patients who have suffered a hemorrhagic stroke...‚Äù. This kind of research is being conducted in labs on Earth using incubators, but growing the stem cells takes an extended period of time. This scientist believes that testing in space will accelerate the growth of the cells. Researchers are also using a technology called organs-on-chips or tissues-on-chips to build tiny versions of human systems. These microchip-like devices are embedded with living cells that will react in space as if the full organ was there. Scientists believe these chips will eventually replace traditional dish cultures and animal testing for studying disease and testing new drugs. The latest tissues-on-chip experiment on the ISS involves growing functional bone tissue. = Protein Crystallization = Microgravity also allows scientists to grow more higher- quality protein crystals that could help improve drug design. Scientists choose to conduct this type of research on the ISS because it's easier to maintain uniform temperatures in liquids in microgravity because of the absence of convection driving the mixing of fluids with different temperature and density. Without convection, the movement of fluids of different density and temperature occurs because of diffusion which is slower than convection. This makes the process of growing crystals more precise. US Lab researchers are growing protein crystals of the Parkinson's disease protein LRRK2. When grown in labs on Earth, the protein's crystals are small and have numerous defects. Scientists believe the effects of microgravity will allow the protein crystals to grow larger and with minimal flaws, which would make the structure easier to analyze. If successful, scientists believe they could develop a drug that would inhibit this protein, either preventing or slowing the progression of this disease. This type of research could also be useful for cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease because scientists have not been able to grow crystals of the active proteins on Earth with good enough quality to image. Protein crystallization could also have an impact on the delivery method of a cancer drug that is currently on the market. The hope is that the lack of gravity-induced variability while formulating the drug on the ISS could help the company improve the administration and effectiveness of the drug by turning an hours long intravenous infusion into a simple injection. = Bone Glue = Another scientist is testing a new glue that fixes fractured bone and stabilizes the seal between metal hardware and bones. The researcher found that when the bone was glued back together on Earth, the materials eventually converted to new bone over time. The researcher is now testing the glue in space to see if it accelerates the formation of new bone. This scientist believes that surgeries on fractured bone could become a lot less complicated if bone glue were used instead of metal plates, screws and rods. = Analyzing Bacterial Growth = Scientists are also analyzing bacterial growth on the ISS and the mutations that may determine the next superbug, or strains of bacteria that have resistance to multiple antibiotic drugs. Observing these mutations will help them develop medicines that will eliminate bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is easily spread and very difficult to treat. = Immune System Responses = Human T Cell One study aims to find treatments for age-related illnesses by observing how microgravity affects T-cells, the type of white blood cells responsible for immune responses. In low gravity, T-cells only activate around half as often or less than the control samples, indicating a reduced ability to fight infection. Because living in microgravity accelerates the same type of problems that old age does, this researcher is interested in determining the earliest point at which T-cells become different in space. = Genetic Changes in DNA = Using a machine to analyze genes, one researcher is testing whether astronauts experience genetic changes in their DNA that would cause them to have weakened immune systems when in space. The findings in this experiment are important because it will determine if astronauts would be able to conduct experiments in space for extended periods of time. = Experiments with Model Organisms = For example, scientists are using microgravity's unique ability to accelerate bone deterioration to study rodent bone loss in space. The experiment involves studying how NELL-1, a molecule in humans that has the ability to grow new bone, works as a treatment for preventing bone loss in mice in space. The findings could lead to the development of treatments in bone restoration, bone loss prevention and bone grafting.  Remote Sensing  The orbital path of the ISS travels over the regions of Earth that contain more than 90 percent of the Earth's population, giving scientists a unique view of our planet. In addition to the view, the ISS also provides better spatial resolution and variable lighting conditions as compared with other satellites used for Earth observation. These new technologies are advancing studies in agriculture, water quality, natural resources, atmospheric monitoring and maritime tracking.  Research Examples = Atmospheric Sensors = A Lightning Imaging Sensor was attached to the ISS on one of its missions to monitor lightning flashes on Earth. The data gathered will help scientists predict weather changes, climate changes and atmospheric changes. Another sensor was attached to the spaceship to monitor changes in the ozone layer. = Monitoring Meteor Showers from Space = A camera was installed on the ISS for a two-year period to monitor meteor showers from space. This investigation helped scientists better understand the behavior of asteroids and comets and how they have affected our planet. The results from the study could also help protect us from potential collisions. = Red Tide Research = Red tide, a harmful algal bloom that releases toxins into our oceans, has been studied on the ISS. Using a special imager that was attached to the spaceship, scientists collected data that helped them detect and classify algal blooms.  Physical Sciences  The loss of buoyancy in space allows scientists to conduct fundamental research in fluid dynamics, combustion, and material sciences. Gaining more understanding of these concepts facilitates advances in the fields of transportation, power generation, manufacturing, and medicine; while at the same time evolving standards for safety and efficiency in multiple disciplines.  Research examples = Artificial Limbs = One of the biggest challenges in space travel is the effect that radiation has on both manmade and natural materials. That's why scientists are seeing if a new gel-like material, designed to be used to make lifelike synthetic muscles for artificial limbs used by humans and robots, could survive a trip to Mars. This material is being tested on the ISS to determine if it retains its durability, flexibility and strength with high levels of radiation. = Study that Focuses on How Certain Pharmaceuticals Dissolve = A pharmaceutical company is conducting an experiment on liquid-solid interactions and how pharmaceuticals dissolve in microgravity. The results could lead to more effective medicines that last longer on the shelf. = Surgical Robots = Surgical robots are being tested in space to increase the efficiency of research conducted on the ISS. The robots will be able to perform small dexterous tasks, which will both expand the type of research that can be performed in space, as well as give the flight crew more time to focus on other experiments. = Consumer Products = Two companies are conducting experiments in space in order to improve consumer products. One company is testing a more efficient showerhead that uses an ‚Äúoscillating chip‚Äù to break up the water and release it faster so that we use less water in the shower. Another is studying how a compound called silica forms in microgravity so it can produce more fuel-efficient tires.  Technology Development  The US Laboratory serves as a testing facility for new developments in remote sensing technology, as well as innovations in computing, electronics, and hardware prototyping. It also has microgravity-enabled material production and manufacturing facilities. The Lab also tests robotics and advanced materials to see if they can withstand the harsh microgravity environment. The results will provide valuable information for future space stations and next-generation satellites.  Research examples = 3D Printer = A 3D printer on the ISS is scheduled to produce ‚Äúparts for satellites and other spacecraft, medical research components, an exercise device for Autodesk, wrenches‚Ä¶and parts for high school projects.‚Äù Researchers believe that manufacturing large structures in space, as opposed to sending them from Earth, will broaden space development and exploration, even as far as producing habitats on the Moon and sending drones to explore other planets. = Cotton Sustainability = Researchers are studying innovative methods to increase cotton sustainability ranging from improving the plants to use less water to getting real time data from Earth- observation to farmers in order to make informed decisions that conserve water and aid in the management of field crops. = Bone Densitometry = The first X-ray machine installed on the space station, called the Bone Densitometer, allows astronauts to study osteoporosis by examining the ‚Äúbone density of model organisms in space by measuring energy levels absorbed by bones via the device.‚Äù  References  Category:United States Department of Energy national laboratories Category:International Space Station ","title":"ISS National Lab"},{"id":"58862812","text":"Sattira 'Sattie' Douglas was an African American abolitionist from the nineteenth century who helped organize multiple confederations in helping African Americans in Chicago and the West.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and is listed on the (now defunct) Australian Register of the National Estate.  History  The former church was built in 1866-67, with a vestry addition between 1871-83. It was designed by O. H. Lewis, son of Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis, and is his only known work. The church hall, designed by Benjamin Backhouse, was built in 1873. In 1924, the church purchased five terrace houses along Forbes Street on land they had long sought to obtain and demolished them to create an entry and forecourt area. It was associated with a number of prominent Sydney figures, including The Sydney Morning Herald owner Charles Kemp, Assistant Commissioner-General Henry Connell, businessman Lebbeus Hordern and author Patrick White. Hordern and Kemp were honoured with stained glass windows. Amidst declining congregations and finances, the church became a branch of St John's Anglican Church in 1986 and was closed in March 1993. It was sold to SCEGGS Darlinghurst in September 1993. The former church is now the school's Great Hall, while the former hall was refurbished in 1998 to serve as its Playhouse. The school has used the former church for Easter and Christmas services. Description The former church is a two-storey sandstone building with a gabled slate roof, designed in the English Gothic Revival style. It consists of a nave with two aisles, a vestry and chancel. The former hall is a single-storey brick building with a sandstone base. The upper hall was divided into three spaces as part of the 1998 refurbishment, while the lower hall retains its two original principal spaces.

She received the National Organization for Women's Woman of the Year Award and was featured in Ms. magazine as one of the 1988 Women of the Year in 1988.  Early life and education  Serrano was born in Puerto Rico to Dhelia and Gaspar Serrano. She had four siblings: Nora, Maria, Debbie, and Michael. She lived in Missouri and New Mexico before moving to Brooklyn in 1961. She divorced her husband in 1975 and raised her two children by herself while paying for and completing university. Serrano graduated from St. Francis College in Brooklyn, New York.  Career  Serrano worked for the Narcotics Bureau of the Brooklyn District Attorney, the Victim's Services Agency, and the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. She was Vice-President of the Hispanic AIDS Forum, secretary of the Latino Commission on AIDS, and a member of the Health and Human Services HIV Planning Council of New York. The government of Australia hired her as a consultant for their AIDS prevention programs. Over her career, she presented many papers in national and international HIV and AIDS conferences. She was a drug counselor working at Long Island College Hospital in 1981 when she began suspecting that her patients were dying from AIDS and AIDS-related conditions. She realized that little was being done by medical and governmental organizations to protect her clients or to prevent them from acquiring HIV, although they were catching spreading the virus in mass, because they were seen as \\"undesirables\\" to the public. She was quoted, \\"They weren't organized the way gays were, nobody wanted to deal with them.\\"  ADAPT  Serrano began to focus her career on activism for IV drug users, and in 1983 she started working for Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), an organization started by recovering drug addicts in 1979. The organization relied on a small full-time staff and large amount of volunteers for their initiatives. She worked to expand outreach and educational programs for HIV/AIDS infected drug users, prostitutes, and Parolee Aftercare Relapse Prevention support groups. She assembled bleach kits to decontaminate syringes and distribute them, along with condoms, to IV drug users. She started setting up information tables in Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn, New York, East Harlem in Manhattan, and Hunts Point/Mott Haven in South Bronx. Serrano said of her work: > I'm there to provide the addicts with information. It bothers me when > they're sticking needles in their arms, but I feel protective. I live my > work 24 hours. When I sleep, I dream about the people who died that day. One drug user impacted by Serrano said of her, \\"She's like the Avon Lady. At first you think 'the lady is nuts,' she's going into buildings the police won't go near, taking her life into her own hands.\\" She coordinated the institution of the AIDS ward at Riker's Island Correctional Facility, where she and ADAPT began requesting the early release of prisoners who had AIDS, so that they could die peacefully in their own homes. In 1988, Serrano became the Executive Director of ADAPT and defied laws banning the unauthorized use of needles and syringes by announcing that ADAPT would start a needle exchange in New York City. It was the first needle exchange in the United States. In 1985, the Department of Health (DOH) under City Health Commissioner Dr. David J. Sencer had tried to start an exchange, but the State didn't support the initiative. Serrano's announcement forced the issue and her pressure led to pilot needle-exchange program by the DOH. In 1990, after the election of Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city stopped the program but ADAPT carried on without support from lawmakers. Later in 1988, she brought in over $2.5 million for its programs. ADAPT also became involved in federally, state, and city-funded research projects; it was the first community-based program to be funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct an epidemiological research study on HIV/AIDS infection among crack cocaine users.  Death and legacy  She died of cancer on October 21, 1993 in St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.

Early life and education  Thompson was born in Pennsylvania, but spent most of her youth growing up in New Jersey and New York State. She graduated from Chatham Township High School in New Jersey. Thompson received her bachelor degree in Chemistry, with honors, from Swarthmore College in 1970. She received her masters in chemistry from Princeton University in 1972 and then went on to get her Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Bryn Mawr College in 1978. She did postdoctoral research at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, then at UC San Diego with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),in Boulder, CO. During her postdoctoral work, Thompson's research focus shifted from physical chemistry to atmospheric chemistry, with influence from Ollie Zafiriou and Ralph Cicerone.  Career  Thompson has worked as a Physical Scientist for NASA from 1986 to 2004, and she returned in 2013 and is now part of the Atmospheric Chemistry Dynamics group. In 1990, Thompson was on the Third Soviet-American Gas and Aerosols cruise, aboard the former soviet R/V Akademik Korolev. The mission of this expedition was to explore air-sea gas exchange, and study trace gases in remote marine areas. it was a successful mission, and began Thompson's career in international atmospheric research. Thompson was co-mission scientist for NASA's 1997 DC-8 SINEX (SASS Ozone and Nitrogen Oxides Experiment) and PI for SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes) which used airborne instruments such as weather balloons carrying ozonesonde packages to measure humidity, temperature and other atmospheric factors. Thompson has also conducted studies with fellow NASA scientist Bob Chatfield, to identify a wind current carrying human made pollution from Asia westward, creating areas of unusually high ozone levers far away from the true causes, these studies also use satellite and weather balloon data.

It is named after Adriano Garsia and Michelle L. Wachs. Problem description The input to the problem, for an integer n, consists of a sequence of n+1 non-negative weights w_0,w_1,\\\\dots, w_n. The output is a rooted binary tree with n internal nodes, each having exactly two children. Such a tree has exactly n+1 leaf nodes, which can be identified (in the order given by the binary tree) with the n+1 input weights. The goal of the problem is to find a tree, among all of the possible trees with n internal nodes, that minimizes the weighted sum of the external path lengths. These path lengths are the numbers of steps from the root to each leaf. They are multiplied by the weight of the leaf and then summed to give the quality of the overall tree. This problem can be interpreted as a problem of constructing a binary search tree for n ordered keys, with the assumption that the tree will be used only to search for values that are not already in the tree. In this case, the n keys partition the space of search values into n+1 intervals, and the weight of one of these intervals can be taken as the probability of searching for a value that lands in that interval. The weighted sum of external path lengths controls the expected time for searching the tree. Alternatively, the output of the problem can be used as a Huffman code, a method for encoding n+1 given values unambiguously by using variable-length sequences of binary values. In this interpretation, the code for a value is given by the sequence of left and right steps from a parent to the child on the path from the root to a leaf in the tree (e.g. with 0 for left and 1 for right). Unlike standard Huffman codes, the ones constructed in this way are alphabetical, meaning that the sorted order of these binary codes is the same as the input ordering of the values. If the weight of a value is its frequency in a message to be encoded, then the output of the Garsia‚ÄìWachs algorithm is the alphabetical Huffman code that compresses the message to the shortest possible length. Algorithm The binary tree constructed in the first phase of the algorithm by finding and merging out-of-order triples in the input sequence (left) and the output of the algorithm, a correctly-ordered binary tree whose leaves are at the same levels as the other tree Overall, the algorithm consists of three phases: # Build a binary tree having the values as leaves but possibly in the wrong order. # Compute each leaf's distance from the root in the resulting tree. # Build another binary tree with the leaves at the same distances but in the correct order. The first phase of the algorithm is easier to describe if the input is augmented with two sentinel values, \\\\infty (or any sufficiently large finite value) at the start and end of the sequence. The first phase maintains a forest of trees, initially a single-node tree for each non-sentinel input weight, which will eventually become the binary tree that it constructs. Each tree is associated with a value, the sum of the weights of its leaves makes a tree node for each non-sentinel input weight. The algorithm maintains a sequence of these values, with the two sentinel values at each end. The initial sequence is just the order in which the leaf weights were given as input. It then repeatedly performs the following steps, each of which reduces the length of the input sequence, until there is only one tree containing all the leaves: *Find the first three consecutive weights x, y, and z in the sequence for which x\\\\le z. There always exists such a triple, because the final sentinel value is larger than any previous two finite values. *Remove x and y from the sequence, and make a new tree node to be the parent of the nodes for x and y. Its value is x+y. *Reinsert the new node immediately after the rightmost earlier position whose value is greater than or equal to x+y. There always exists such a position, because of the left sentinel value. To implement this phase efficiently, the algorithm can maintain its current sequence of values in any self-balancing binary search tree structure. Such a structure allows the removal of x and y, and the reinsertion of their new parent, in logarithmic time. In each step, the weights up to y in the even positions of the array form a decreasing sequence, and the weights in the odd positions form another decreasing sequence. Therefore, the position to reinsert x+y may be found in logarithmic time by using the balanced tree to perform two binary searches, one for each of these two decreasing sequences. The search for the first position for which x\\\\le z can be performed in linear total time by using a sequential search that begins at the z from the previous triple. It is nontrivial to prove that, in the third phase of the algorithm, another tree with the same distances exists and that this tree provides the optimal solution to the problem. But assuming this to be true, the second and third phases of the algorithm are straightforward to implement in linear time. Therefore, the total time for the algorithm, on an input of length n, is O(n\\\\log n). History The Garsia‚ÄìWachs algorithm is named after Adriano Garsia and Michelle L. Wachs, who published it in 1977. Their algorithm simplified an earlier method of T. C. Hu and Alan Tucker, and (although it is different in internal details) it ends up making the same comparisons in the same order as the Hu‚ÄìTucker algorithm. The original proof of correctness of the Garsia‚ÄìWachs algorithm was complicated, and was later simplified by and .

The book is about the Victorian era in nineteenth-century Britain. It begins with the Act of Union in 1800 and ends with the Parliamentary victory of the Liberal Party in 1906. Cannadine opens with the Charles Dickens' quote, \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" He argues that Britain maintained its status as leader of the global economy and possessor of the largest navy in the world. At the same time, the country was plagued by internal problems and social conflicts. According to the Whig Interpretation of history, the \\"victorious century\\" represented a time of expanding democracy and wave of Parliamentary acts providing political reform and universal manhood suffrage. Cannadine argues, Summary Cannadine begins with the Act of Union with Ireland, identifying the year 1800 as the beginning of Britain's victory over France and attainment of global hegemony. Waves of political reform manifest themselves through the 1832 Reform Act, the Chartist movement, and the 1867 Reform Act. Queen Victoria's ascendance to the throne in 1837 marks a new era for Britain, one where active enthusiasm and drive for global empire becomes a popular ideal. Cannadine also analyzes the key statesmen of the Victorian era: William Pitt, Robert Peel, Viscount Palmerston, William Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, and more. He also views The Great Exhibition in 1851 as a milestone in British cultural and imperial history. The book analyzes Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and concludes with the Liberal victory in Parliament in 1906. Critical response Victorious Century has been commended for its new perspective on nineteenth-century British politics, economy, and imperial ambitions. Professor Maya Jasanoff of Harvard University offers considerable praise for the book, stating that Cannadine has \\"pulled off the hat-trick of commanding erudition, original interpretation and graceful writing.\\" Professor Jane Ridley of the University of Buckingham asserts that \\"Only a historian at the very top of his game can do that and get away with it, and Cannadine succeeds triumphantly.\\" Professor Paul Kennedy of Yale University also remarks that the book is \\"an admirably readable guide to the British history of the long 19th century.\\" Reviews in The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have also lauded the book as an admirable endeavor. The book has also received criticism, notably from Professor Richard J. Evans of the University of Oxford. In his review, he claims that Cannadine \\"says hardly anything in detail about the economic problems and social inequalities that beset Georgian and Victorian Britain\\" and asserts that \\"the book is not an easy read.\\" The Editors' Choice section of The New York Times featured Victorious Century as a recommended book in 2018.

History Early history Sonnerupgaard is first mentioned when it was owned by Niels Pedersen in 1341. It was later handed down to his son and grand daughter. Peder Bild acquired the estate in the middle of the 16th century. After his death in 1566, Sonnerupgaard was passed on to Christoffer Bild. The estate was later in the century owned by Jakob Trolle and then by his widow Mette Jakobsdatter H√∏g Banner. By 1621. Sonnerupgaard had been acquired by Manderup Parsberg. He was one of the great landowners of his time and had acquired much of his property through his marriages. His widow Anne Brahe kept the estate after his death in 1625. After her death in 1633, Sonnerupgaard was endowed to her brother Otte Brahe who sold it to J√∏rgen Urne later that same year. Irne and his wife were also the owners of Alslev, N√¶r and Knudseje. After J√∏rgen Urne's death in 1642, Sonneruypgaard was passed on to his son Knud Urne. He sold the estate to Bertel Bartholin in 1661. He was a son of the physician and theologian Casper Bartholin. Johannes Fincke acquired the estate in1675. Later that same year he sold it to his brother-in-law Rasmus Poulsen Vinding. He was the principal writer of Christian V's Danish Code. After Rasmus Poulsen Vindin'g death in 1684, Sonnerupgaard was sold by his heirs to Bodil S√∏rensdatter Hiort. She later ceded the estate to her son Severin Junge. In 1731 , he was raised to the peerage under the name de Junge. He owned a number of estates but sold Sonnerupgaard in i 1745. The new owner was Adolf Andreas von der L√ºhe. Just a few years later he sold the estate to Frederik Brabrand. He was a strong advocate for agricultural reforms and wrote several articles on the subject. Johan Thomas Neergaard, the largest landowner on central Xealand, acquired the estate in1788. He was also the owner of Ringsted Abbey, Merl√∏segaard, S√∏gaard and T√∏ll√∏se. The Zeuthen family He later sold Sonnerupgaard, S√∏gaard and T√∏ll√∏se to Peder Christian Zeuthen. He was a member of the kongelige landhusholdningsselskab from 1788.

His son Christian Frederik Zeuthen bought out the other heirs in 1828. He created the Barony of Zeuthen from his three estates in1843. Christian Frederik Zeuthen was a co-founder of Kreditkassen til Selvejendoms Fremme and was an elected member of the st√¶nderforsamlingen in 1840 and 1847. He was an active member of a circle of landowners who opposed the adoption of the Danish Constitution in 1849. Martinus R√∏rbye: A Hunter Shows His Wife the Result of the First Snipe Gunt.

Christian Frederik Zeuthen died in 1850 and his widow Sophie Hedvig Schulin then kept the estate until her death in 1866. The barony was then passed on to her brother Christian Frederik Schulin who the following year took the name Schulin-Zeuthen. His son constructed a new main building and home farm towards the end of the century. Christian Julius William Schulin-Zeuthen died without children in 1919.

It is the position of a person who is lying flat on their back with the legs elevated approximately 8-12 inches. The purpose of the position is to elevate the legs above the heart in a manner that will help blood flow to the heart. This test involves raising the legs of a person's (without their active participation), which causes gravity to pull blood from the legs, thus increasing circulatory volume available to the heart (cardiac preload) by around 150-300 milliliters, depending on the amount of venous reservoir. The real-time effects of this maneuver on hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate are used to guide the decision whether or not more fluid will be beneficial. The assessment is easier when invasive monitoring is present (such as an arterial catheter). The maneuver might be reinforced in a clinical setting by moving the patient's bed from a semi-recumbent (half sitting, half laying down) position to a recumbent (laying down) position with the legs raised. This is theorised to cause an additional mobilisation of blood from the gastrointestinal circulation. Direct measurement of cardiac output is the more reliable comparing to the measurement of blood pressure or pulse pressure because of pulse pressure amplification during this procedure. Cardiac output can be measured by arterial pulse contour analysis, echocardiography, esophageal Doppler, or contour analysis of the volume clamp- derived arterial pressure. Any bronchial secretions must be aspirated before performing this test. The legs should not be elevated manually because it may provoke pain, discomfort, or awakening that can cause adrenergic stimulation, giving false readings of cardiac output by increasing heart rate. After the maneuver, the bed should be placed back into semi-recumbent position with cardiac output measured again. The cardiac output should return to the values measured before the initiation of this maneuver. This test can be used to assess fluid responsiveness without any fluid challenge, where the latter can lead to fluid overload. Compression stockings should be removed before the test so that adequate volume of blood will return to the heart during the maneuver. The physiology of assessing fluid responsiveness via passive leg raise requires increasing systemic venous return without altering cardiac function - a form of functional hemodynamic monitoring. Several studies showed that this measure is a better predictor of response to rapid fluid loading than other tests such as respiratory variation in pulse pressure or echocardiographic markers. Placing the person in the Trendelenburg position, does not work since bloodvessels are highly compliant, and expand as result of the increased volume locally. More suitable would be the use of vasopressors.

History  The 21 cm Versuchm√∂rser 06 was designed in 1899 and built by Krupp in 1903-1906. The Versuchm√∂rser 06 was a successor to earlier 21 cm weapons that had been in service since the Franco-Prussian War. The Versuchm√∂rser 06 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar weapons such as the French 220 mm TR mle 1915/1916 or British BL 8 inch Howitzer Mk 6 - 8.  Design  The Versuchm√∂rser 06 was a short barreled breech-loading howitzer on a two-wheeled box trail carriage with a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism. The gun had an early form of horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The advantage the Versuchm√∂rser 06 had over its predecessor the 21 cm M√∂rser 99 was its recoil mechanism raised its rate of fire from one round every three minutes to one round per minute. The 21 cm M√∂rser 99 required a piece of ground to be leveled and a wooden firing platform assembled before use. Two wooden ramps were then placed behind the wheels and when the mortar fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. However, the Versuchm√∂rser 06 did not require as much site preparation and did not require re-aiming between shots. Despite its advantages, the Versuchm√∂rser 06 did not pass its acceptance tests and was not placed into mass production because the German Army required range and lighter weight which was later accomplished by the 21 cm M√∂rser 10. However, enough test models were produced to arm two four-gun batteries. To facilitate towing on soft ground the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. For transport, the Versuchm√∂rser 06 could be broken down into two separate wagon loads for the barrel and carriage. The barrel was towed on its own four-wheeled wagon with an integral hoist to mount/demount the barrel.

Instead, Olag√ºe held that the events of 711 could be explained as skirmishes involving allied North African troops within the context of a civil war pitting Catholic Goths led by Roderic against Goths adhering to some form of Arianism and a largely nontrinitarian Spanish population, including Nestorians, Gnostics, and Manichaeans.

It was originally built for the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) but was eventually sold to the Lake Winnipeg Research Consortium (LWRC) who converted it to a Lake Winnipeg research vessel. Scientists using the Namao to research the environmental issues concerning the lake, for example the increasing eutrophication of the lake and the impact of invasive species. Using the Namao, the LWRC integrates education and community outreach into their work to promote sustainable living and development focussed on the youth in local communities surrounding Lake Winnipeg who are affected most by the changing dynamics of the lake. Design  The ship was originally designed for the CCG. It is a small research vessel with a length of , a breadth of and a weight of nearly . It requires nine people to crew the ship and can accommodate 15 people comfortably. It is the largest ship in the Gimli harbour, its current home port. History In 1975 the CCGS (Canadian Coast Guard Ship) Namao was made to serve as a Class 900 buoy tender for the Canadian Coast Guard. Built in Riverton, Manitoba, it has strong ties to Lake Winnipeg. The Namao was stationed in Selkirk and was used to deploy and recover buoys and occasionally to assist vessels in distress. Between 1994 and 1996, the Namao was used for research on the geological history of Lake Winnipeg by the Geological Survey of Canada. This was the first time the Namao was used for research. In 1997, the Namao was owned by the Aids to Navigation Program; this was privatized and the Namao was sent for disposal through Crown Assets. Around the same time the Lake Winnipeg Research Consortium (LWRC) was formed to coordinate scientific research on Lake Winnipeg. They requested the use of the Namao for research purposes and were successful in attaining it in 1999. The base for the Namao was moved to Gimli and the ship changed from a CCGS to a Lake Winnipeg research vessel. Funding The Namao is funded by the Lake Winnipeg Research Consortium with help from the Government of Manitoba. Since the province began funding the Namao in 2003 they have invested $1.25 million toward the operation of the Namao. In the Sustainable Development Annual Report, the Government of Manitoba recognizes the role of scientific research in restoring the health of Lake Winnipeg and how this contributes to sustainable development of communities who rely on the lake as part of their economy and well-being. Environmental research In the past few decades the health of Lake Winnipeg has deteriorated at an alarming rate. In 2013 it was named ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most threatened lake‚Äù by the Global Nature Fund. The Namao, as the official research vessel of Lake Winnipeg, helps scientists examine the physical, biological, ecological, and chemical structure of the lake, and the processes that are critical to its well-being. Eutrophication Since eutrophication is one of the biggest environmental concerns facing Lake Winnipeg, it is researched on the Namao. Scientists aboard the Namao were able to deduce that the significant cause of the eutrophication of the lake is the runoff of phosphorus. They also learned that contrary to previous assumptions, most of the nutrient loading into the lake was coming from the Red River Basin. Phosphorus abatement efforts and other sustainable development projects aimed at mitigating runoff of phosphorus can be better applied. The Namao also allows scientists to provide progress reports on the health of the lake and assess how various restoration and management strategies are working once implemented. The Namao scientists were able to test the huge algal blooms caused by eutrophication and assess how dangerous they may be to human and other organism health. Zebra mussels The scientists aboard the Namao monitored the presence of zebra mussels as they became established, studied the environmental impacts of zebra mussels in the lake including the decline of native mussel populations, researched how they became introduced, and helped create and conduct control operations. Education and outreach The Namao also provides education and outreach programs to youth in communities surrounding Lake Winnipeg. The Namao offers a lake ecology field program twice a year to students between grades 6 and 12. Students on excursions in the south basin of the lake sample and analyze aspects of the lake ecosystem including the water, algae, micro-organisms and the contents of the lake floor.

He based this misidentification on Chinese woodblock illustrations that depicted a mythological mo (Ë≤ò) chimera with elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail, and tiger paws (also known as the Japanese baku Áçè), which the famous Tang poet Bai/Bo Juyi first described in the 9th century. The consequences of Abel-R√©musat's error were extensive. His presumption that mo meant \\"Chinese tapir\\" was immediately adopted in Western zoology, and by the end of the 19th century it was accepted as modern scientific fact in China and Japan. In the 20th century, since mo had lost its original meaning, the giant panda was given a new Chinese name da xiongmao (Â§ßÁÜäË≤ì lit. \\"large bear cat\\"). Zoology Giant panda illustration, Wilhelm Kuhnert 1927 Watercolor of the Malayan tapir, 1819-1823 William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings The giant panda or panda bear (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a large, black and white bear native to mountainous forests in South Central China. Its habitat is mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighboring Shaanxi and Gansu. The panda's coat is mainly white with black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, shoulders, and legs. Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. The Malayan tapir or Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus) is a black and white odd-toed ungulate, somewhat piglike in appearance, and with a long flexible proboscis. Its habitat includes southern Myanmar, southern Vietnam, southwestern Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra. The animal's coat has a light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its buttocks, and the rest of its hair is black, except for the white-rimmed tips of its ears. The Malayan tapir is exclusively herbivorous, and eats the shoots and leaves of many plant species. Zooarchaeology reveals that fossil bones of Ailuropoda and Tapirus occurred in Pleistocene animal remains in Southern China region (Harper 2013: 191). The giant panda and tapir continued to occupy the lowlands and river valleys of Southern China until the Pleistocene and Holocene boundary, around 10,000 years before present (Harper 2013: 193). Paleolithic humans in China likely had opportunities to encounter pandas and tapirs, but about 3,500 years before present, the tapir no longer inhabited China (Chang 1999: 43). Shang dynasty animal remains excavated at Anyang, Henan included Tapirus but not Ailuropoda. Two tapir mandibular fragments are the only instance of Pleistocene or Holocene tapirs found so far north. The paleontologists Teilhard de Chardin and Yang Zhongjian believed the tapir bones were evidence of a Shang import from the south, and they are the \\"last zoological evidence of human-tapir contact in China, occurring in a zoogeographic region never inhabited by the tapir\\" (Harper 2013: 193). The circa 13th to 11th centuries BCE Shang oracle bones, which constitute the earliest known corpus of ancient Chinese writing, include some Oracle bone script tentatively identified as mo < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò or Áçè) graphs. According to Harper, these Shang oracle and Zhou bronze inscriptions were more likely a name for a clan or place than a wild animal (Harper 2013: 194-195). Western zoologists first learned of both the Malayan tapir and giant panda in the 19th century. In January 1816, Major William Farquhar, the Resident of Malacca, sent the first account of the Malayan tapir to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland with drawings of the animal and its skeleton. However, he did not assign a binomial name for the \\"tapir of Malacca\\", and Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest coined Tapirus indicus in 1819 (Lydekker 1900: 31). In December 1816, G. J. Siddons discovered a young tapir in British Bencoolen, Sumatra that he shipped to The Asiatic Society in Calcutta (Maxwell et al. 1909: 100-102). The French naturalist Pierre-M√©dard Diard, who studied under Georges Cuvier, read Farquahr's account, examined Siddons's tapir in the Governor's menagerie at Barrackpore, and sent a description to Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest in Paris, who published an account of the tapir in 1819 (Seton 1820: 422-424, Farquhar et al. 2010 :26-27). In 1869, the French Lazarist priest Armand David (1826-1900) acquired a specimen that hunters in Sichuan captured alive, which was killed and shipped to Paris for study. He coined the giant panda's original binomial name Ursus melanoleucus (from Latin \\"black and white bear\\") and the corresponding French name ours blanc et noir (David 1869 5: 13). The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., became the first foreigners to shoot a panda, on a 1929 expedition funded by the Field Museum of Natural History. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, which went to live at the Brookfield Zoo (Harper 2013: 186, 214). Terminology Late Shang dynasty bronze script for Ë≤ò, c. 11th century BCE Qin dynasty seal script for Ë≤ò, 3rd century BCE Chinese has numerous names for the \\"giant panda\\" ranging from Old Chinese *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò or Áçè) to Modern Standard Chinese d√†xi√≥ngmƒÅo (Â§ßÁÜäË≤ì). Note that Old and Middle Chinese reconstructions are from William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart (2014). Mo The standard \\"giant panda\\" name m√≤ (Ë≤ò) is written with several graphic variant characters. M√≤ < Middle Chinese mak < Old Chinese *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò or Áçè, giant panda) are phono-semantic compound characters that combine the phonetic component m√≤ < mak < *mÀÅak (Ëé´, \\"no; nothing; not\\") with the semantic indicators \\"predatory beast\\" Ë±∏ or \\"dog\\" Áä≠. M√≤ < m√¶k < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ä or Ë≤â) was an \\"ancient ethnonym for non-Chinese people in northeast China\\" (cf. Korean Maek (Ë≤ä) people), which was sometimes used as a homophonous phonetic loan character to write m√≤ < mak < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò, panda). The graphs combine the \\"predatory beast\\" semantic indicator with b«éi < p√¶k < *pÀÅrak (Áôæ, hundred) and g√® < kak < *kÀÅak (ÂêÑ, each) phonetic components‚ÄîË≤â is usually pronounced h√© < x√¶k < *q ∞ÀÅrak meaning \\"racoon dog\\". Chinese characters for non-Chinese (\\"barbarian\\") peoples frequently used these \\"beast\\" and \\"dog\\" semantic indicators as ethnic slurs, see Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese. These panda-name variants mo (Ë≤ò, southwestern animal) and mo (Ë≤ä, northeastern region) were easily distinguished from context. The notion of \\"whiteness\\" is a common factor among names for the black-and-white \\"giant panda\\". Mo < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ä, \\"panda\\") has a variant mo or bo (Ë≤É), with a b√°i < b√¶k < *bÀÅrak (ÁôΩ, \\"white\\") phonetic component. The earliest dictionary definition of mo (Ë≤ò, \\"panda\\") is b√°ib√†o < *bÀÅrakpÀÅ‚Äπr‚Ä∫u (ÁôΩË±π, \\"white leopard\\", see the Erya below). Chinese auspicious creatures were frequently white, such as the baihu (ÁôΩËôé, White Tiger) and baize (ÁôΩÊæ§) below (Harper 2013: 218). Paleography confirms that early graphs for mo < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò or Áçè) occur in bronze script on Chinese bronze inscriptions from the Shang dynasty (c. 1600‚Äì1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasty (c. 1046‚Äì256 BCE), and in seal script standardized during the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE). The ancient bronze and seal scripts combine an animal pictograph semantic indicator with a *mÀÅak phonetic component written with double Ëâ∏ or Ëâπ \\"grass\\" and Êó• \\"sun\\" elements, but the bottom \\"grass\\" was changed to Â§ß \\"big\\" in the modern phonetic m√≤ (Ëé´). The Old Chinese etymology of m√≤ < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ä, Ë≤â, Êº†, ËÜú) words connected with m√π < *m…ôk (Áâß, pasture; herd; herding; animals) (Schuessler 2007: 390, 393). In 5th and 4th century BCE southern Chu manuscripts excavated in Hubei, m√≤ < *mÀÅak (Ëé´) was used to write \\"animal pelt\\" (Chen 2004: 251). Other panda names The giant panda has some additional Chinese names. Ancient myths that pandas can eat iron and copper led to the appellation sh√≠tiƒõsh√≤u (È£üÈêµÁç∏, iron-eating beast). The Chinese variety spoken in the main panda habitat of Sichuan has names of huaxiong (Ëä±ÁÜä, \\"flowery bear\\") and baixiong (ÁôΩÁÜä, \\"white bear\\", reiterating \\"whiteness\\" mentioned above), which is now the usual Chinese name for the \\"polar bear\\" (Harper 2013: 191). The modern Standard Chinese name daxiongmao (Â§ßÁÜäË≤ì, lit. \\"big bear cat\\", giant panda), which was coined from the taxonomic genus Ailuropoda from New Latin ailuro- \\"cat\\". The related name xiaoxiongmao (Â∞èÁÜäË≤ì \\"small bear cat\\") refers to the lesser or red panda (Ailurus fulgens) native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. Associated names Woodblock illustration of the pi (Ë≤î), 1725 Gujin Tushu Jicheng Besides the above panda-specific terms there are several related animal names. In early Chinese zoological terminology, the mo < *mÀÅak (Ë≤ò, \\"giant panda\\") was considered a kind of b√†o < *pÀÅ‚Äπr‚Ä∫u (Ë±π, \\"leopard\\"). The Erya below defines mo as b√°ib√†o < *bÀÅrakpÀÅ‚Äπr‚Ä∫u (ÁôΩË±π, \\"white leopard\\"). P√≠ < *bij (Ë≤î) or p√≠xi≈´ < *bijq ∞u (Ë≤îË≤Ö) was a \\"mythical fierce grey and white tiger- or bear-like animal\\" that scholars have associated with the giant panda. The Erya defines pi as baihu < *bÀÅrak…° ∑ÀÅa (ÁôΩÁãê, \\"white fox\\") and its young is called h√π < *…°ÀÅa î (Ë±∞). Guo Pu's commentary gives an alternate name of zhiyi < *tipl…ôj (Âü∑Â§∑), and groups pi with tigers and leopards (ËôéË±π‰πãÂ±¨). The Shuowen jiezi entry links pi with the northeastern region Mo (Ë≤ä or Ë≤â, also used for \\"panda\\"): \\"Belongs to the group leopard (Ë±πÂ±¨), comes from the country Mo (Ë≤â). 'The Shijing says, \\"offer as a gift that pi pelt (ÁçªÂÖ∂Ë≤îÁöÆ)\\", and the Zhoushu says, \\"like tiger like pi [Â¶ÇËôéÂ¶ÇË≤î].\\" Pi is a ferocious beast [ÁåõÁç∏].\\" Three Shuowen jiezi entries after this one, the mo (Ë≤ò, panda) is said to have come from Shu in the southwest. Thus, in pre-Han and Han texts the words mo and pi \\"did not denote the same animal and pi cannot be the giant panda\\" (Harper 2013: 219). Xuanmo < *…¢ ∑ÀÅinmÀÅak (ÁéÑÁçè \\"dark mo\\") was a regional product that the northeastern Yi people of Lingzhi (present day Hebei) submitted to the Zhou court, according to the pre-Han Yi Zhou shu. The 3rd century commentator Kong Chao (Â≠îÊôÅ) referred to the Erya definition of mo as baibao (\\"white leopard\\") or baihu (ÁôΩÁãê, \\"white fox\\") in a variant text reading, and defined xuanmo as heibao (ÈªëË±π, \\"black leopard\\") or heihu (ÈªëÁãê, \\"black fox\\"). However, since xuanmo came from northeast of China it is unlikely that the referent was the giant panda from the southwest (Harper 2013: 217). Ch√©ng < *C.lre≈ã (Á®ã, \\"amount; rule; journey\\") is an obscure animal name that could be related to the mo. The Zhuangzi and Liezi have the phrase \\"qingning generates cheng, cheng generates horse, horse generates humankind\\" (ÈùíÂØßÁîüÁ®ã Á®ãÁîüÈ¶¨ È¶¨Áîü‰∫∫) in a passage on cyclical processes. A medieval quotation from the lost book Shizi said cheng (Á®ã) was equivalent with the standard Chinese name bao (Ë±π, \\"leopard\\") and the Yue (southeast coastal region) regional name mo (Ë≤ò). The commentator Shen Gua (1031-1095) said the ancient meaning might be the same as the contemporary usage in Yanzhou (in present-day Shaanxi), where cheng was the local word for chong (Ëü≤, meaning \\"tiger; leopard\\"). Harper concludes that even if we assume the Shizi quotation is authentic, the information that cheng, bao, and mo were ancient synonyms in regional languages is not evidence that any of them referred to the giant panda (2013: 217). Ji«éot√π < *k-rÀÅiw î lÃ•ÀÅa-s (Áã°ÂÖî, \\"cunning hare\\") is an iron-eating animal related to the mo. It is recorded in the Shiyi ji (ÊãæÈÅ∫Ë®ò, Record of Gleanings), compiled by the Daoist Wang Jia (d. 390 CE) from apocryphal histories. \\"The cunning hare found on Kunwu Mountain is shaped like rabbit, the male is yellow and the female white, and it eats cinnabar, copper, and iron. Anciently, when all the weapons in the King of Wu's armory went missing, they dug into the ground and discovered two hares, one white and one yellow, and their stomachs were full of iron, which when cast into weapons would cut jade like mud. The cunning hare is in the mo panda category.\\" (ÊòÜÂêæÂ±±Áã°ÂÖîÂΩ¢Â¶ÇÂÖîÈõÑÈªÉÈõåÁôΩÈ£ü‰∏πÁü≥ÈäÖÈêµ ÊòîÂê≥ÁéãÊ≠¶Â∫´ÂÖµÂô®ÊÇâÁõ°ÊéòÂú∞Âæó‰∫åÂÖî‰∏ÄÁôΩ‰∏ÄÈªÉËÖπÂÖßÁöÜÈêµÂèñÈëÑÁà≤ÂäíÂàáÁéâÂ¶ÇÊ≥•ÁöÜË≤òÈ°û‰πü). Mo giant panda Chinese texts have described the mo \\"giant panda\\" for over two millennia. Erya The circa 4th or 3rd century BCE Erya lexicon section shou (Áç∏ \\"beasts\\") defines mo (Ë≤ò, \\"giant panda\\") as a baibao (ÁôΩË±π, \\"white leopard\\"). The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is an alternate identification of this \\"white leopard\\" (Read 1931, no. 352). The Erya commentary by Guo Pu (276-324) says the mo, > Resembles a bear, with a small head, short legs, mixed black and white; able > to lick and consume iron, copper, and bamboo joints; its bones are strong > and solid within, having little marrow; and its pelt can repel dampness. > Some say that a white-colored leopard has the separate name mo. (tr. adapted > from Harper 2013: 185, 205) [‰ººÁÜäÈ†≠Â∫≥ËÖ≥ÈªëÁôΩÈßÅËÉΩËàêÈ£üÈäÖÈêµÂèäÁ´πÈ™®È™®ÁØÄÂº∑Áõ¥‰∏≠ÂØ¶Â∞ëÈ´ìÁöÆËæüÊøïÊàñÊõ∞Ë±πÁôΩËâ≤ËÄÖÂà•ÂêçË≤ò] The next two Erya definitions of animal names are parallel with mo: han < *…°ÀÅam (Áîù) is a baihu < *bÀÅrakq ∞ÀÅra î (ÁôΩËôé, \\"white tiger\\"); shu < *C…ô.liwk (Ëô™) is a heihu < *mÃ•ÀÅ…ôkq ∞ÀÅra î (ÈªëËôé, \\"black tiger\\"). Guo's commentary says the names referred to white-colored and black-colored tigers, not zoologically different animals. Unlike the mo giant panda's familiar cultural identity and history, neither han nor shu occurs in any early texts besides the Erya (Harper 2013: 216). Shanhai jing The c. 3rd or 2nd century BCE Shanhai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) mytho-geography does not directly mention mo (Ë≤ò), but says one mountain has panda-like mengbao (ÁåõË±π, \\"ferocious leopards\\"), and Guo Pu's 4th century CE commentary to another mountain says it was the habitat of mo („πÆ) pandas. The description of Nanshan (ÂçóÂ±±, South Mountain) says, \\"On its summit are quantities of granular cinnabar [‰∏πÁ≤ü]. The River Cinnabar rises here and flows north to empty into the River Rapids. Among the animals on this mountain are numerous wild leopards [ÁåõË±π]. Its birds are mostly cuckoos [Â∞∏È≥©].\\" (tr. Birrell 2000: 15). Guo Pu says, \\"The ferocious leopard resembles the bear but is smaller. Its fur is thin and brightly glossy; it can eat snakes and eat copper and iron; it comes from Shu. Alternatively, the graph bao Ë±π is written hu Ëôé [tiger].\\" (ÁåõË±π‰ººÁÜäËÄåÂ∞èÊØõÊ∑∫ÊúâÂÖâÊæ§ËÉΩÈ£üËõáÈ£üÈäÖÈêµÂá∫ËúÄ‰∏≠Ë±πÊàñ‰ΩúËôé) (tr. Harper 2013: 220). The sub- commentary of Hao Yixing (ÈÉùÊáøË°å) identifies mengbao < *mÀÅr…ô≈ã îpÀÅ‚Äπr‚Ä∫u (ÁåõË±π, \\"ferocious leopard\\") or menghu < *mÀÅr…ô≈ã îq ∞ÀÅra î (ÁåõËôé, \\"ferocious tiger\\") as the similarly pronounced mobao < *mÀÅakpÀÅ‚Äπr‚Ä∫u (Ë≤òË±π, \\"panda leopard\\"). The Shanhai jing description of Laishan (Â¥çÂ±±, Lai Mountain) says, \\"On the mountain's south face are quantities of yellow gold, and on its north face are numerous elk and great deer [È∫ãÈ∫à]. Its trees are mostly sandalwood and dye mulberry [Ê™ÄÊüò]. Its plants are mostly shallot and garlic [Ëñ§Èü≠], and many iris [ËëØ]. There are sloughed-off snakeskins [Á©∫Â•™] on this mountain.\\" (tr. Birrell 2000: 88). Guo identifies Lai Mountain with Qionglai Mountain (in ancient Shu, present day Sichuan), notes it was the habitat of the mo („πÆ), and says, \\"Mo resembles a bear or a black and white bo, and also eats copper and iron\\" [„πÆ‰ººÁÜäËÄåÈªíÁôΩÈßÆ‰∫¶È£üÈäÖÈêµ‰πü] (tr. adapted from Harper 2013: 185). Bo (ÈßÅ, \\"contradict\\") names \\"a mythical beast like a saw-toothed piebald horse that eats tigers and leopards\\". Despite the similarities between how Guo Pu's Erya commentary above describes the mo (Ë≤ò, \\"panda\\"), and his descriptions of the mo („πÆ, \\"panda\\") on Lai Mountain and mengbao (ÁåõË±π, \\"ferocious leopard\\") on South Mountain; he plainly does not identify the thin-furred mengbao or menghu as the black and white panda, but rather as another metal-eating animal from Shu that resembled the bear (Harper 2013: 221). Shuowen jiezi Xu Shen's c. 121 Shuowen jiezi Chinese character dictionary definition of mo (Ë≤ò) says, \\"resembles the bear, yellow and black in color, comes from Shu\\" (the region of present-day Sichuan). Duan Yucai's 1815 commentary to the Shuowen jiezi identifies mo as the \\"iron-eating beast\\" (Èêµ‰πãÁç∏) or Shanhai jing's \\"ferocious leopard\\" (ÁåõË±π). He says \\"the animals still inhabited the eastern part of Sichuan, and were a nuisance to locals who gathered firewood in the mountains and who needed to take iron to feed the metal-hungry pandas. Dishonest people sell panda teeth as fake Buddhist ≈öarƒ´ra relics.\\" (Harper 2013: 185). The cultural motif of metal-eating animals was neither unique to the panda nor to China, and by the 3rd or 4th century this folklore occurred from the Mediterranean to China and often in connection with the forge and metalworking (Harper 2013: 223). The evidence of the Erya and Shuowen jiezi indicates that pre-Han and Han readers knew the giant panda by the name mo, which they understood to be both bear-like and belong to the leopard category (Harper 2013: 221). Early poetry Beginning with the Han dynasty, the giant panda was a popular trope in Classical Chinese poetry. Mo first appeared in Sima Xiangru's c. 138 BCE Shanglin fu (‰∏äÊûóË≥¶, Rhapsody on Shanglin Park). Emperor Wu of Han's Shanglin (Supreme Grove) hunting park west of the capital Chang'an that contained wildlife from all of China, organized by habitat. The twelve Beasts of the South, where \\"In deepest winter there are germination and growth, bubbling waters, and surging waves,\\" included the mo giant panda (tr. \\"tapir\\" by Knechtges 1982 2: 89), zebu, yak, sambar, elephant, and rhinoceros. Archeological excavations confirmed the giant panda as object of spectacle in the same century. The tomb menagerie of Empress Dowager Bo (d. 155 BCE) included a giant panda, rhinoceros, horse, sheep, and dog; implying that in addition to animal performances and hunting, \\"we may imagine the elite observing the giant panda and other wildlife at close range in enclosures\\" (Harper 2013: 221). The giant panda next appeared in Yang Xiong's (53 BCE-18 CE) rhapsody on the Shu capital (present day Chengu) that lists mo among the wildlife of Min Mountain north of the city. Both Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong were natives of Shu, and likely knew the giant panda from personal experience (Harper 2013: 222). Zuo Si (c. 250-c. 305) mentioned the mo in hunting passages from his rhapsodies on the southern capitals of Shu and Wu. In the Wu capital (Wuxi in Jiangsu) the hunters \\"trampled jackals and tapirs\\" (tr. Knechtges 1982 1: 413) or \\"kicked dhole and giant panda\\" (tr. Harper 2013: 222; Ëπ¥Ë±∫Áçè), and in the Shu capital hunt \\"They impale the iron- eating beast\\" (ÊàüÈ£üÈêµ‰πãÁç∏) and \\"Shoot the poison-swallowing deer\\" (Â∞ÑÂô¨ÊØí‰πãÈπøË±∫) (tr. Knechtges 1982 1: 365, glossing \\"iron-eating beast\\" as Malayan tapir). The commentary by Liu Kui (ÂäâÈÄµ, fl. c. 295) says mo pandas were found in Jianning (Âª∫ÂØß), present-day Chengjiang County, Yunnan, and glosses \\"iron-eating beast\\" by repeating the common belief that the giant panda could rapidly consume large amounts of iron simply by licking with its tongue. Shenyi jing An animal named nietie ÈΩßÈêµ \\"iron-chewer\\" is mentioned in the Shenyi jing (Á•ûÁï∞Á∂ì \\"Classic on Divine Marvels\\"), a collection of regional information on marvelous creatures, which is traditionally attributed to Dongfang Shuo (c. 160 BCE ‚Äì c. 93 BCE) but more likely dates from the 2nd century CE. \\"In the south quarter there is a beast with horns and hoofs whose size is like the water buffalo. Its coat is black like lacquer. It eats iron and drinks water. Its feces can be used to make weapons whose sharpness is like steel. Its name is \\"iron-chewer.\\" (ÂçóÊñπÊúâÁç∏ÊØõÈªëÂ¶ÇÊºÜÈ£üÈêµÈ£ÆÊ∞¥ÂêçÈΩßÈêµ) (tr. Harper 2013: 223). A 10th century quotation not found in the transmitted Baopuzi text referred to the Shenyi jing \\"iron-chewer\\", \\"Master Dongfang recognized the iron-swallowing beast\\" (Êù±ÊñπÁîüË≠òÂïñÈêµ‰πãÁç∏). Although the origins of the Chinese metal eating motif are uncertain, it remained an identifying characteristic of mo through the 19th century when Duan Yucai noted it. Harper proposes that the nietie \\"iron- chewer\\" embodied this motif, and although the mo panda was already associated with whiteness and metal, the marvelous \\"iron-chewer\\" added to its cultural identity (2013: 224). Bencao gangmu Li Shizhen's 1596 Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) section on animal drugs enters mo (Ë≤ò) between leopard and elephant entries. > The skins are used as rugs and mattresses. It is a good absorbent of body > vapours. It is like a bear, head small, feet short, with a black and white > striped skin. The hair is short and glossy.

Firing does not effect the bones. It is said that > antelope horn can break a diamond, so can the bones of a tapir. (tr. Read > 1931, no. 353, translating \\"Malayan tapir\\") Li Shizhen lists three associated animals: Nietie (ÈΩßÈêµ), \\"A southern species. The size of water buffalo, black and shiny. The feces are as hard as iron. One animal was recorded 7 feet high which could travel 300 li a day.\\" An (Ë±ª), \\"A monstrous terrific beast producing one horn. [Giles dictionary], the tapir. Some accounts ally it with the Mongolian mastiff [Hugou (ËÉ°Áãó)]. It is like a black fox, 7 feet long, in its old age it has scales. It can eat tigers, leopards, crocodiles, and metals. Hunters are afraid of it.\\" Jiaotu (Áã°ÂÖî), \\"In the K'un-Wu mountains there is a rabbit-like animal which is iron eating. The male is yellow and the female white.\\" (tr. Read 1931, no. 353a-c). Li also gives three medicinal uses for the mo: Pi (ÁöÆ, skin), \\"Slept on it will remove heat boils, and it keeps off damp and bad infections.\\" Gao (ËÜè, fat), \\"For carbuncles. It is well absorbed.\\" Shi (Â±é, feces), \\"Taken to dissolve copper or iron objects which have been accidentally swallowed.\\" (tr. Read 1931, no. 353). Mo mythical chimera Woodblock illustration of the mo (Ë≤ò), 1609 Sancai Tuhui Woodblock illustration of the mo (Ë≤ò), 1712 Wakan Sansai Zue Woodblock illustration of the mo (Ë≤ò), 1725 Gujin Tushu Jicheng Woodblock illustration of the mo (Ë≤ò), 1801 Erya Yintu (ÁàæÈõÖÈü≥Âúñ) From the Han through the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907), the giant panda name mo consistently referred to an exotic black and white bear-like animal found in southern China, with a pelt that repelled dampness, and legends about its solid bones, hard teeth, and metal eating. Giant panda pelts were luxury items and Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649) presented mo pelts as banquet gifts to a select group of officials (Harper 2013: 205). Then in the 9th century, the renowned Tang poet and government official Bai/Bo Juyi (772‚Äì846) popularized the name mo denoting a fantastic mythological chimera with elephant trunk‚Äìrhinoceros eyes‚Äìcow tail‚Äìtiger paws components, drawings of which were supposedly able to repel contagion and evil. Chinese mythology has a long chimeral tradition of composite or hybrid beasts with parts from different animals (Loewe 1978, Strassberg 2002: 43-45). Some examples are the denglong, kui, fenghuang, and qilin. In comparative mythology, many cultures have four-animal part hybrids combining four kinds of animal parts, comparable to the Chinese \\"quadripartite mo\\". Bai Juyi wrote about suffering from headaches‚Äît√≥ufƒìng (È†≠È¢®, lit. \\"head wind\\") that according to traditional medical theory were caused by the feng (È¢®, wind) \\"wind-ailments\\" (cf. Western miasma theory)‚Äîand he used a folding screen known as a p√≠ngfƒìng (Â±èÈ¢®, \\"wind screen/wall\\") to prevent drafts. The poet commissioned an artist to paint a fabulous mo on his wind screen, which Bai enjoyed so much that he composed his famed Moping zan (Ë≤òÂ±èË¥ä, Mo folding- screen paean) in 823. The preface explains: > The mo has elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail, and tiger paws > [Ë≤òËÄÖË±°ÈºªÁäÄÁõÆÁâõÂ∞æËôéË∂≥]. It inhabits the mountains and valleys of the south. To sleep > on its pelt repels contagion [ÂØ¢ÂÖ∂ÁöÆËæüÁòü]. To draw its form repels evil [ÂúñÂÖ∂ÂΩ¢ËæüÈÇ™]. > In the past I suffered from wind-ailment of the head [ÁóÖÈ†≠È¢®], and whenever I > slept I always protected my head with a small screen. By chance I met a > painter and had him draw (the mo). I note that in the Shanhai jing this > beast eats iron and copper, and eats nothing else. This stirred me and now I > have composed a paean for it. (tr. Harper 2013: 204-205) Bai used two Chinese medicinal terms for what a mo image specifically repelled: wƒìn (Áòü, \\"epidemic; infection\\") and xi√© (ÈÇ™, \\"evil; unhealthy influences that cause disease\\"). Earlier Chinese sources about mo did not mention drawing one in order to repel evil through apotropaic magic, and artists were free to shape the hybrid beast without reference to the giant panda (Harper 2013: 205). The Japanese baku (Áçè) changed the Chinese myth about the mo image preventing illness to dream-devouring in order to prevent nightmares. Bai's \\"eats iron and copper, and eats nothing else\\" reference comes from Guo Pu's 4th century commentary to the Shanhai jing and not the pre-Han classic text. The Shanhai jing proper mentions the mengbao \\"ferocious leopard\\" on South Mountain, which Guo notes as a metal-eating beast similar to the mo, and mentions Lai Mountain, which he glosses as a mo habitat. Bai Juyi's reading of the Shanhai jing with Guo's commentary, conflated the \\"ferocious leopard\\" and mo \\"panda\\" as same metal-eating animal (Harper 2013: 220). Duan Chengshi's 863 Youyang zazu (Assorted Morsels from Youyang) is a miscellany of legends and stories, including the giant panda under the name moze (Ë≤òÊæ§, lit. \\"panda marsh\\"). \\"The moze Ë≤òÊæ§ is as large as the dog. Its fat has the quality of dispersing and smoothing. When placed in the hands or when stored in copper, iron, or pottery vessels it entirely permeates them. When contained in bone it does not leak.\\" (tr. Harper 2013: 205-206). This Youyang zazu context is the only extant early record of the word moze < Middle Chinese m√¶kdr√¶k, which Harper explains as a Tang pun with the marvelous baize < b√¶kdr√¶k (ÁôΩÊæ§, White Marsh) creature. Its omniscience of the world's supernatural creatures was supposedly written down as the lost Baize tu (ÁôΩÊæ§Âúñ, White Marsh diagrams), which were popular iconographic drawings used to protect the home from harm. Harper suggests an origin for the mo's elephant trunk. In the 8th and 9th centuries the Indian elephant-headed deity Ganesha was the Buddhist counterpart to the popular Chinese spirit-protector Baize (2013: 206-207). In the centuries after the Tang, Chinese people's ideas and impressions of the mo were mostly obtained from old textual accounts and illustrations in woodblock printed books, not from nature. The woodblock illustrations are variations on Bo Juyi' s elephant trunk‚Äìrhinoceros eyes‚Äìcow tail‚Äìtiger paws components mo, regularly with the elephant trunk but not consistently. Details were sometimes selectively combined, as when bear-like features were mixed with elephant trunk (Harper 2013: 208). For instance, the Piya dictionary, compiled by Lu Dian (Èô∏‰ΩÉ) (1042-1102), described the mo as: \\"resembling the bear with elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, lion head, dhole fur. Its feces can be made into armaments that will cut jade, its urine can dissolve iron into water.\\" (Ë≤ò‰ººÁÜäÁçÖÈ¶ñË±∫È´≤Èã≠È¨êÂçëËÑöÁ≥ûÂèØÁà≤ÂÖµÂàáÁéâÂ∞øËÉΩÊ∂àÈêµÁà≤Ê∞¥). The oldest mo illustration dates from the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) or Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368). It is found in the Erya yintu (ÁàæÈõÖÈü≥Âúñ, Erya Pronunciations and Illustrations), the extant 1801 facsimile woodblock edition of the Yuan facsimile manuscript copy of an illustrated Song edition of the Erya. The head with ears and trunk appears more like an elephant than the later Chinese and Japanese illustrations in which Abel-R√©musat recognized the tapir. The main difference is the coat, which is depicted with white midsection, and is the one detail that connected the quadripartite mo to the giant panda in nature, whose coat has black shoulders and legs with white in the middle. The Erya yintu illustration is the only early example of this black and white mo depiction (Harper 2013: 209). Mo Malayan tapir Juvenile Malayan tapir with dappled markings Up until the late Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the Chinese name mo (Ë≤ò) continued referring to both \\"giant panda\\" and \\"chimera with an elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail, and tiger paws\\", and owing to Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat's mix-up in the 1820s, mo was misidentified as the recently discovered \\"Malayan tapir\\". In 1416, Ma Huan (c. 1380‚Äì1460), who accompanied Admiral Zheng He on three of his seven expeditions to the Western Oceans, recorded the first Chinese sighting of a tapir in Palembang, South Sumatra. Ma's Yingya Shenglan (The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) says, > Also, the mountains produce a kind of spirit beast whose name is shenlu Á•ûÈπø > \\"spirit deer.\\" It resembles a large pig and is about three feet high. The > front half is entirely black and one part of the rear is white; the hair is > fine and uniformly short; and its appearance is attractive. The snout > resembles the pig snout without the flatness. The four hoofs also resemble > pig hoofs but with three toes. It only eats plants or woody stuff; it does > not eat strong-tasting food or flesh. (tr. Harper 2013: 204) Some early scholars, who were unaware of the Middle Chinese zyinluwk, say the inhabitants of Sumatra never called the tapir \\"divine stag\\" and propose that shenlu (Á•ûÈπø) transcribed the Malay name tenuk, suggesting the Hainanese \\"Hylam dialect\\" that pronounces these characters as tinsin (Maxwell et al. 1909: 97-98). The c. 437 Book of the Later Han (86, Treatise on the Nanman) mentioned a different southern shenlu (Á•ûÈπø) : \\"In Yunnan, there is a two-headed spirit deer that can eat poisonous plants.\\" (Èõ≤ÂçóÁ∏£ÊúâÁ•ûÈπøÂÖ©È†≠ËÉΩÈ£üÊØíËçâ). The 4th century Huayangguo zhi noted the shenlu was found on Xiongcang Mountain (ÈõÑÂÄâÂ±±). While studying medicine at the Coll√®ge de France, Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat (1788-1832) became fascinated with a Chinese pharmacopoeia and taught himself to read Chinese by studying the 1671 Zhengzitong (Correct Character Mastery) dictionary for five years. Its mo (Ë≤ò) entry says, \\"The teeth are so hard that they will smash an iron hammer to pieces. Fire will not affect the teeth, which can only be smashed with an antelope's horn.\\" (ÈΩíÊúÄÂ†Ö‰ª•ÈêµÈéö‰πãÈêµÁöÜÁ¢éËêΩ ÁÅ´‰∏çËÉΩÁáíÊÉüÁæöÁæäËßíËÉΩÁ¢é‰πã). He became inaugural holder of the chair in Chinese and \\"Tartar-Manchu\\" languages at the Coll√®ge de France in 1814. The preeminent zoologist Georges Cuvier, Abel-R√©musat's Coll√®ge de France colleague, informed him that in 1816 a new tapir species had been found in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, the first discovery in Asia of an animal that Europeans had encountered in the New World since the 16th century. When Cuvier published a revised \\"osteology of tapirs\\" (1822), he included the Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and acknowledged Abel-R√©musat for showing him mo illustrations in Chinese and Japanese books that seemed to depict a tapir. In addition to the elephantine snout, both scholars thought that the markings shown on the mo's coat suggested the characteristic striped and spotted coat of the young Malayan tapir (Harper 2013: 188). In 1824, Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat's brief article \\"Sur le tapir de la Chine\\", with a mo (Ë≤ò) lithograph by Charles Philibert de Lasteyrie (1759-1849) based on Chinese and Japanese woodblock illustrations, was published in the Journal asiatique. This seminal article \\"combined textual sources without distinguishing time period\\" and confused the ancient Chinese mo panda and medieval mo chimera with an \\"Oriental tapir\\" (T. sinensus) (Harper 2013: 188). The article first cites the 1716 Kangxi Zidian dictionary that quoted mo passages from the Erya, Shuowen jiezi, and 1627 Zhengzi tong dictionaries, along with the Shenyi jing and Shiyi ji. In Abel-R√©musat's view the Kangxi zidian entry contained fantastic, unreliable details. While the Shiyi ji noted the polymath Su Song (1020-1101) described the Tang custom of painting the mo on screens and cited Bai Juyi's phrase \\"drawing its form repels evil\\" as corroboration, the Kangxi zidian definition did not include Bai's original description of mo's quadripartite form (Harper 2013: 188). Abel-R√©musat evaluated Li Shizhen's 1596 Bencao gangmu entry on mo as the most reliable source, which cited Su Song on its \\"elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, cow tail, and tiger paws.\\" Between illustrations and text, Abel-R√©musat concluded that despite some implausible details, the Chinese mo was obviously the tapir. Looking beyond the single instance of the mo he argued: \\"Chinese books are filled with observations on natural history of great interest and in general fairly accurate. It suffices to know how to distinguish them from the fables which are mixed together with them, and this is usually not so difficult.\\" (tr. Harper 2013: 189). Abel-R√©musat concluded that mo was the name of the \\"Chinese tapir\\" which he presumed, based on the Bencao gangmu locating the mo panda's habitat in Sichuan and Yunnan, and still \\"inhabited the western provinces of China and must be fairly common there.\\" The agronomist and printer Charles Philibert de Lasteyrie's lithograph of the mo reflected Chinese and Japanese woodblock illustrations from leishu (\\"category book\\") encyclopedias, which traditionally copied pictures from earlier reference works. The mo illustration in Wang Qi's (ÁéãÂúª) 1609 Sancai Tuhui (Collected Illustrations of the Three Realms [heaven, earth, and humans]) is typical, and the source for de Lasteyrie's 1824 lithograph (Harper 2013: 190, Figure 13). It was accurately copied into many later publications, for instance the 1712 Japanese Wakan Sansai Zue and 1725 Chinese Gujin Tushu Jicheng. In each illustration, the raised left front paw is definitive evidence of copying. The original Sancai Tuhui version depicted the mo with a flecked leopard coat; the mo entry is preceded by the chibao (Ëµ§Ë±π, \\"red leopard\\") and followed by the pi (Ë≤î, \\"a ferocious animal\\" above). Both illustration were drawn with spotted coats. Abel-R√©musat and de Lasteyrie were predisposed to see the image of a tapir and perceived the mo's coat as the distinctive spots and stripes of a juvenile tapir's coat. De Lasteyrie's coat lozenge design differed from the original Chinese illustrations and reinforced Abel-R√©musat's \\"Chinese tapir\\" notion (Harper 2013: 190). Abel-R√©musat's 1824 \\"tapir\\" identification of mo was quickly adopted into 19th century reference works, as illustrated by the mo entries in the first three major Chinese- English dictionaries. *\\"An animal said to resemble a wild boar; to have the trunk of an elephant, the eye of a rhinoceros, the tail of a cow, and the foot of a tiger.\\" (Morrison 1819, 1.2: 588) *\\"A white leopard, like a bear, with a small head, and hard feet; the body is half white and half black; it is said to be able to wear away iron and copper, and the joints of bamboos by licking them; its bones are strong and solid within, having little marrow, but its skin cannot endure dampness. Another account says, that it is of a yellow colour, that its teeth are very hard so as to break iron hammers; if thrown into the fire they will not burn, and there is nothing but the horn of an antelope that can affect them. Others say, that it is of a black colour, and that it devours the hardest metals: it is said that the weapons in a military arsenal being once found missing, they dug into the ground and discovered two of these animals, with a quantity of iron in their stomachs, which being formed into weapons would cut gems like mud. Notwithstanding all these fabulous descriptions, it appears that the animal intended is the tapir.\\" (Medhurst 1843: 1085) *\\"The Malacca tapir (Tapirus malayanus), which the Chinese say was found in Sz'ch'uen, and is still found in Yunnan; they describe it as like a bear, with a black and white body, able to eat iron and copper, and having teeth that fire cannot burn; it has the nose of an elephant, eye of a rhinoceros, head of a lion, hair of a wolf, and feet of a tiger; a distorted figure of it was anciently drawn on screens as a charm.\\" (Williams 1889: 583) Five years before the \\"tapir\\" misidentification, Robert Morrison's 1819 A Dictionary of the Chinese Language relied on Chinese-Chinese dictionaries and described the mo chimera. Nineteen years after it, Walter Henry Medhurst's 1843 Chinese and English Dictionary summarized the Kangxi zidian dictionary entry for mo and added that it was the tapir. Sixty-five years after Abel-R√©musat's identification and twenty before the panda became known in the West, Samuel Wells Williams's 1889 A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language specified, using early terminology, mo as the Malayan tapir (T. indicus), which was not found in China, claims that it‚Äîrather than the mo giant panda‚Äîwas found in Sichuan and Yunnan, conflates early panda myths with Bo Juyi's mo chimera, and notes it was drawn on screens. Western zoological literature about the tapir reached Meiji period Japan before Qing dynasty China. In 1885 Iwakawa Tomotar≈ç (Â≤©Â∑ùÂèãÂ§™ÈÉé) and Sasaki Ch≈´jir≈ç (‰Ωê„ÄÖÊú®Âø†Ê¨°ÈÉé) published D≈çbutsu ts≈´kai (ÂãïÁâ©ÈÄöËß£, General Zoology), which was based mainly on their teacher Henry Alleyne Nicholson's 1873 A Manual of Zoology ‚Ä¶, and gave the Japanese name for the tapir as baku (Ë≤ò) (1885: 146-148). In China the 1915 first edition Ciyuan modern encyclopedic dictionary gave two definitions for mo (1915: 82). The first quoted the Erya with Guo Pu's commentary and concluded with Hao Yixing's (1757-1825) opinion that mo meant mobao (Ë≤òË±π, \\"panda leopard\\"). The second definition was modern Japanese usage: \\"in Japan tapir is translated baku (tapir Êó•Êú¨Ë≠ØÁÇ∫Ë≤ò). Du Yaquan (Êùú‰∫ûÊ≥â), editor-in-chief of the first modern Chinese publishing house Commercial Press, published Dongwuxue da cidian (ÂãïÁâ©Â≠∏Â§ßËæ≠ÂÖ∏, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Zoology) in 1922, which reconfirmed mo as the standard zoological nomenclature for the tapir (1922: 2281). Neither D≈çbutsu ts≈´kai nor Dongwuxue da cidian included the giant panda (Harper 2013: 212-213). The first giant panda account in a Japanese or Chinese zoological work was Eri Megumi's (ÊÅµÂà©ÊÅµ) 1925-1927 D≈çbutsugaku seigi (ÂãïÁâ©Â≠¶Á≤æÁæ©, Zoology in Detail), which used Japanese irowakeguma („ÅÑ„Çç„Çè„Åë„Åê„Åæ) to translate \\"Parti-Coloured Bear\\", which along with \\"Giant Panda\\" was one of the two English names given in the naturalist Ernest Henry Wilson's 1913 account of animals in western China. The most remarkable detail in D≈çbutsugaku seigi was Eri's unexplained statement that in China this animal must have once had the name mo (Ë≤ò). The Chinese translation of D≈çbutsugaku seigi (Li 1929) included both names in English transcription along with two Chinese names mentioned by Wilson: pi (ÁæÜ) and baixiong (ÁôΩÁÜä, \\"white bear\\"), and validated that Eri's mo statement was on record in Japan and China (Du 1939, 3: 1784) (Harper 2013: 213). The Chinese name xiongmao (ÁÜäË≤ì, \\"bear cat\\"), which originally referred to the cat-sized lesser panda, appears in two respected 1930s Chinese-Chinese dictionaries defining the giant panda. The 1936 first edition Cihai definition summarized the giant panda's modern history, mostly cited the activity of foreigners, and made two mistakes: \\"Xiongmao: Name of an unusual creature. It inhabits Xinjiang. Its body is very large. It is one of the rarest of unusual creatures surviving today. It was discovered sixty years ago by the French scientist Father David. In 1929 certain younger brothers of General Roosevelt of America captured it for the first time for exhibition at the Field Museum in Chicago. This animal's proper classification is not yet determined.\\" (tr. Harper 2013: 215). Later editions of the Cihai did not correct the xiongmao entry's errors about Xinjiang rather than Sichuan and about Theodore Roosevelt's brothers rather than sons. The 1937 Guoyu cidian (ÂúãË™ûËæ≠ÂÖ∏, Dictionary of the National Language) definition of xiongmao repeated the Cihai error about a Xinjiang habitat, but it was corrected in the 1947 revised edition to read, \\"it inhabits the western part of Sichuan.\\" In addition, the revised edition distinguished the two kinds of panda: da xiongmao (\\"large bear cat\\", giant panda) and xiao xiongmao (\\"small bear cat\\", lesser panda) (Harper 2013: 215). Until the 1970s, reference works uniformly defined Chinese mo as the scientific name for \\"tapir\\". For instance, the family Tapiridae is Chinese moke (Ë≤òÁßë) and the genus Tapirus is moshu (Ë≤òÂ±û). \\"One man's speculation led to an event of modern cultural amnesia and the giant panda was erased from the record of pre-modem Chinese civilization.\\" (2013: 187). In modern China, the zoologist Gao Yaoting (È´òËÄÄ‰∫≠) wrote the earliest article (1973) to confirm that mo was historically the giant panda's name. Gao distinguished between the ancient sources saying the animal named mo was bear-like and which materia medica identified as the giant panda and the medieval literary invention of a fantastic elephant-rhinoceros-cow-tiger chimera that Bo Juyi introduced. Being unfamiliar with Abel-R√©musat's 1824 article, Gao conjectured that mid-19th century Western zoological literature knew the giant panda by the local Sichuan names huaxiong (Ëä±ÁÜä, \\"flowery bear\\") and baixiong (ÁôΩÁÜä, \\"white bear\\"). In the west, Donald Harper, a sinologist specializing in early Chinese manuscripts, wrote a cultural history of the mo giant panda (2013). It meticulously traces the strange history of the name mo from pre-Han texts referring to the giant panda, to the Tang belief that images of the fantastic elephant-trunked mo chimera would prevent illness, to the 1820s misidentification of mo as an assumed \\"Chinese tapir\\", which became commonly accepted as scientific fact. Besides restoring the giant panda's name and representation in early China, Harper also provides \\"a lesson in scholarly practice for all of us who use texts and allied materials to speculate about China's past and try to present the facts\\" (2013: 187). Eastern Zhou dynasty animal-shaped bronze, c. 6th-5th century BCE, Freer Gallery of Art Western Zhou dynasty animal-shaped bronze zun wine vessel, c. 10th century BCE, Baoji Bronzeware Museum Identifying ancient zoomorphic Chinese ritual bronzes as \\"tapirs\\" provides a final example of mo misunderstandings. Some modern scholars, unaware that mo did not denote the tapir until the 19th century, identify a type of Zhou dynasty animal-shaped bronzes as tapirs, paralleling Abel-R√©musat's fallacy: \\"if the creature depicted in an old image or object sufficiently resembles the creature we recognize in nature it must be the creature we recognize\\" (Harper 2013: 195). Two examples of zoomorphic bronzes seen as mo tapirs date from the Western Zhou (c. 1046‚Äì771 BC) and Eastern Zhou (770‚Äì255 BC) periods. William Watson was the first to apply the label \\"tapir\\" to a Chinese bronze, identifying one in a set of four Eastern Zhou sculptures looted in Shanxi during the 1920s (Rawson 1990: 708-711), which are displayed in the British Museum and the Freer Gallery of Art (1962: pl. 79c). Thomas Lawton later said that the quadruped \\"bears a general resemblance to a tapir\\" (1982: 77). Clay molds for casting this type of sculpture were discovered in the excavation of an ancient bronzeware foundry at Houma, Shanxi, which was the capital of Jin state during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. An earlier Western Zhou example is a Baoji Bronzeware Museum zoomorphic zun wine vessel discovered in the 1970s at Rujiazhuang (ËåπÂÆ∂Ëéä), Baoji, Shaanxi, with a long snout serving as the spout, and which the preliminary report described as sheep-shaped with curled horns. Hayashi Minao (ÊûóÂ∑≤Â•àÂ§´ 1983) identified this animal as a tapir, and treated the zoologically impossible horns as whorl- shaped ears that signified the tapir's supernatural power of hearing, without any supporting evidence. Sun Ji (Â≠´Ê©ü 1986) also believed it was a stylized Malaysian tapir, and recognized it as the chimerical elephant-trunked mo that Bo Yuji described, ignoring the uniform early descriptions of the mo as bear- like (Harper 2013: 197-199).

She primarily conducts research on plant ecology and environmental biology with an emphasis on how boreal forest and tundra are responding to rapid rates of climate change.  Early life and education  Johnstone was born and raised in Vermont having both U.S.A. and Canadian citizenship. Her interest in northern ecosystems developed while studying at Middlebury College, where she earned her B. A. in 1992, majoring in Northern Studies. Three years later in 1995, she received her Masters in Science in Biogeography at the University of British Columbia. Soon after she began her professional career by becoming a self-employed environmental consultant performing contract work for several institutions including the Canadian Wildlife Service, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the Yukon Territorial Government Renewable Resources, and the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. She earned her Ph.D. in Ecology at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks under her supervisor F. Stuart Chapin III in 2003. At the University of Saskatchewan, she taught undergraduate and graduate courses in community ecology, environmental biology, and statistics since 2006. Currently, the greater majority of her work specializes in the dynamics of forest and tundra in the mountainous regions of Alaska and Yukon, as well as flatter landscapes in northern Saskatchewan and NWT. She lives in Canada where she continues her active northern research program as a freelance researcher based close to Whitehorse, Yukon.  Research and career  Her current work is an extension of her graduate studies. While working towards her Ph.D in Biology, Johnstone began publishing more peer-reviewed publications such as her 2002 study which studied the variations in plant forage quality in the Porcupine Caribou Herd. She has continued publishing while becoming a post-doctoral research fellow at Carleton University and eventually a professor in the Department of Biology and the University of Saskatchewan. As of this time her most recent publication has been a study of ecological memory and forest resilience. Her study has helped uncover how ecosystems respond to disturbances and are maintained by the legacies of information and material. Johnstone's research at the Northern Plant Ecology lab focuses on how changes in natural ecosystem disturbances such as the severity and frequency of fires influence forests and their response to climate change. Johnstone studies these changes by observing the effects of climate change that cause changes in the processes of plant regeneration and colonization. This specifically includes a study of what types biotic and abiotic interactions are responsible for the different species likelihood of successful succession after a community assembly. She correlates this focus to climate warming by studying how migrating southern species may take advantage of natural disturbances by invading northern communities during regrowth. She connects her findings to predict future changes in northern ecosystems and what these new interactions mean for management of human disturbances. Her lab's success is acknowledged by the seven years of funding support from various funding agencies to herself and her students (amounting to more than $350,000).

Mirkin is commonly known for his recommendations on standard medicine as well as his non-standard recommendations on health concerns and his criticism for preliminary medical research findings without appropriate verified resources. Due to his unconventional recommendations, he also receives criticism from other doctors.  Education  Mirkin is a graduate of Harvard University and the Baylor University College of Medicine. He is board-certified in four areas: allergy and immunology, pediatrics, pediatric allergy and a now-defunct board of sports medicine. He did his residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital and fellowship at Johns Hopkins.  Career   Teaching  Mirkin has served as an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, teaching a course based on his book The Sportsmedicine Book from 1976-1980. He served as a teaching fellow at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and an associate clinical professor in pediatrics at the Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.  Writing  Mirkin wrote The Sportsmedicine Book which discusses proper diet, exercise, and injuries from exercise. Along with The Sportsmedicine Book, he has written a total of 16 books and has written a chapter on sports medicine for the Merck Manual. Gabe Mirkin has written a number of syndicated columns on sports medicine which appeared weekly in 31 newspapers and was a contributor in a monthly column for The Runner magazine. His monthly journal, the Mirkin Report, reportedly had over 25,000 subscribers. The Sportsmedicine Book Mirkin's book (written in collaboration with Marshall Hoffman), The Sportsmedicine Book, is considered to be one of his most noted works. It discusses and exposes the prevailing myths of sports medicine and offers what Mirkin considers to be useful facts in their place.  Radio hosting  Mirkin was offered his own regular radio show by WCAU executives on December 1978. A mini-studio was built in his home from which he broadcast live via a remote hookup with the station every weeknight. Based on his ratings, his show was most popular among people aged 35 to 64. Mirkin had a program on the Talk America Radio Networks that was broadcast over 75 stations in the United States and Canada. His show centers on callers asking questions on health, fitness, and nutrition. He has also had a daily fitness feature called Dr. Gabe Mirkin on Fitness broadcast for CBS Radio News during the 1970s.  American talk radio networks  One of Mirkin's latest shows on Talk Radio 98.5 WRTA from July 2019 discusses the possible solution to Alzheimer's disease. On the show, Mirkin discusses the medical articles sent by Doug Herendeen ‚Äì the host ‚Äì and shares his opinion on the suggested possible alternative method to curing Alzheimer's disease. Mirkin also interacted with callers to discuss their ailments and provide recommendations as well as further medical knowledge.  Controversies   Antibiotics as cure for rheumatoid arthritis  Mirkin's syndicated column in The Philadelphia Inquirer was dropped in 1976 due to receiving angry letters fueled by Mirkin's non-standard advice on treating rheumatoid arthritis with antibiotics and other issues along with the suspicion that he did not have a large readership. When questioned about the decision, Joseph Gambardello ‚Äì Inquirer deputy features editor - says that ‚ÄúIt seemed as if Mirkin was, on any particular subject, just focusing on one possible cure or treatment without recognizing the possibility that the condition might have been something else, might have required other treatments, or that there even were other treatments.‚Äù According to Warner Barth ‚Äì chairman of rheumatology at the Washington Hospital Center ‚Äì the standard view is that rheumatoid arthritis is not caused by infection. According to Barth, the benefits patients see from antibiotics appear to come from the drugs‚Äô anti-inflammatory properties. Mirkin, however, insists that rheumatoid arthritis is caused by infection. Mirkin's views were supported by a study presented to the American College of Rheumatology on November 1997 where the early administration of an antibiotic showed significant improvements in the swollen, painful joints of rheumatoid arthritis. Since the findings were released, Barth has claimed to have a little more positive opinion of the treatment but remains wary of it.

It is native to the Eastern United States. The species has two varieties, H. denticulatum var. recognitum and H. denticulatum var. acutifolium. The herb has a diploid number of 24 or 48. Taxonomy The most closely related species to Hypericum denticulatum is Hypericum rigidum var. sellowianum, a plant native to southeastern Brazil. The large disjunction in the distribution of the two herbs is most likely the result of ancient long distance dispersal. The H. denticulatum complex has typically been treated as comprising two taxa, regarded in the past as separate species, two varieties, and most recently two subspecies. In 1948 Fernald and Schubert divided the species into three varieties, var. typicum (which became var. denticulatum), var. acutifolium, and var. recognitum. The last two varieties encompassed the former species Hypericum virgatum which had narrower leaves and sepals. In var. acutifolium they included specimens once described as Hypericum harperi. However, in 1980 Webb distinguished H. harperi by its morphology, ecology, and distinct distribution. Webb also confirmed reports of chromosome numbers n = 12 and 24 for H. denticulatum, showing that while n = 12 is found in varieties acutifolium and denticulatum as well as H. harperi, n = 24 is only found in var. denticulatum. Authors including Gleason, Cronquist, and Adams recognized var. acutifolium and var. recognitum as one variety, and the variety is now considered a subspecies (as is var. denticulatum). The specific epithet denticulatum means \\"small-toothed\\", referring to the marginal teeth on the petals. Walter named the species on account of the apiculate petals while Kunth named his H. denticulatum (H. galinum) in reference to the denticulate leaf margin of the species. In H. denticulatum subsp. acutifolium, the name acutifolium means \\"acutely leaved\\". In the former variety H. denticulatum var. recognitum, the name recognitum means \\"studied anew\\". Description Hypericum denticulatum is an erect perennial, typically glabrous throughout. The slender, herbaceous stems are strict or ascending, usually clumped together and arising from surculose bases. The four-angled, densely dotted stems reach in height and have four- lined internodes measuring . The stems only branch at the typically aerenchymatous base and in the inflorescences. The nearly erect leaves are ovate, oval, or oboval, have acute tips, and are rounded at their sessile bases. The leaves are thick, leathery, and firm, the longest measuring in length and most measuring wide, most being shorter than the internodes. Typically leaves are planar but they can become recurved when dry. The leaves have one to five basal veins and are densely dotted. The terminal, pyramidal to corymbiform inflorescences bear up to 25 scattered racemose flowers on their ascending branches. The inflorescence is monochasial after the fourth grade, with lateral dichasial or monochasial branches six nodes below, the lateral branches bearing up to fifteen flowers. The pedicels are long and bracts are long. The star-shaped flowers are wide. The herbaceous sepals are oblong to narrowly ovate with acute apices, measuring long and wide. Each sepal has three to five veins. The petals are a coppery yellow, measuring long and wide. The 50 to 80 stamens are irregularly spaced, the longest measuring . The ovoid ovary is long and wide. The singularly locular capsule is ovoid and held by the sepals. The three styles, measuring long, are distinct, short, and have capitate stigmas. The ovoid capsules measure long and wide. The seeds are long. H. denticulatum closely resembles Hypericum erythreae but can be distinguished by its shorter stems and more dense foliage. H. denticulatum subsp. denticulatum can be distinguished by its shorter stature, growing tall, and by its lower internodes. Its appressed leaves are long and wide. Its sepals are long and wide. Its diploid number is 24 or 48. It can be found in moist ditches, pine barrens, and prairies at elevations between . H. denticulatum subsp. acutifolium is taller than subsp. denticulatum, growing to . Its leaves are long and wide. Its sepals are long and wide. Its petals tend to be more yellow and less orange than the other subspecies. It has a diploid number of 24. The subspecies occurs in dry roadsides, fields, and woodlands at elevations up to or possibly higher, with a less coastal distribution than the other subspecies. Distribution and habitat Hypericum denticulatum grows in sandy or argillaceous shores, swamps, ditches, gravelly hills, and pine barrens at altitudes between . The herb occurs in Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia, and rarely in Illinois as H. denticulatum var. recognitum.

It is endemic to Rote Island in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Islands, where it lives in primary deciduous forest and secondary forest. It is genetically highly distinct from other leaf warblers in the region, and it may be the first bird species to be described partly on the basis of genome-wide data. It can be phenotypically distinguished from other species by its coloration and the length of its bill, which is far longer than that of most other Asian leaf warblers. This is likely an adaptation to the dry climate of Rote Island. However, despite its heavy morphological and genetic divergence from other island leaf warblers, it has little vocal differentiation from them. Due to heavy agricultural use on Rote Island for many years, only two major forest areas remain that can sustain this species.

It was built from 1880 to 1888. It is also known as Iona Cottage, while the private hospital was variously known as Wootton, Winchester and Hughlings. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Darlinghurst: With its elevated position over the city, the area has been called Woolloomooloo Heights, Eastern Hill and Henrietta Town. In the 1820s, Governor Ralph Darling renamed the suburb in honour of his wife, Eliza Darling.Crosson, 2013 By 1800 several large windmills were situated on the heights of this area, using its stiff breezes to grind much-needed flour from grain. The area began its suburban life under the name \\"Henrietta Town\\", being called after Mrs Macquarie, whose second name was Henrietta. At that time it was an Aboriginal reserve. Loyalties changed with Governors when Darling took office, changing its name to Darlinghurst in honour of his popular wife. \\"Hurst\\" is an old English word for a wooded hill. Iona Cottage Iona is on land which was once part of a grant of just over five acres to William Long in August 1835. James Wright leased the land from Long in early 1836 and when the land was subdivided in 1845, part of it was purchased by Elizabeth Grose. Mrs Grose's property was one of several in the very fashionable Darlinghurst Heights. From 1866 until 1869 Mrs Grose's house was occupied by Richard Jones and from 1872 the occupant of the house was Robert Carter. That year was also the first listing of the name of the house - \\"Iona Cottage\\". Mrs Grose sold her property in 1879 and the land was subdivided into 9 lots. Robert Carter extended the house, replaced the shingled roof with iron and continued to live at Iona Cottage until 1884. At the time he financed the sale, Iona was described as a five bedroom gentleman's residence. Second and current Iona (1888) Edward Chisholm, a wealthy Sydney merchant and pastoralist, purchased the property in October 1888. Edward built a new home on the site, also called \\"Iona\\". Chisholm and his family resided in the house until his death in 1898, and the property was transmitted to the Perpetual Trustee Company. In 1906 the name of the street was changed to Darley Street, possibly named after Sir Frederick Matthew Darley who at that time was the Chief Justice of New South Wales and Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. The site became known as 2 Darley Street. Adela Taylor, the wife of Sir Allen Taylor, purchased the property in March 1908 and renamed the house \\"Wootton\\". Allen Taylor founded his firm of timber growers, merchants and sawmill proprietors. He was at one time Lord Mayor of Sydney. Taylor Square is named after him. Private hospital From 1912 to 1977, Iona/Wootton operated as a private hospital, variously known as Wootton Private Hospital (1912-1949), Winchester Private Hospital (1949-1968), Hughlings Private Hospital (1968-1977). The Taylors sold the property in December 1912 to Eliza Hyem, wife of Alexander Hyem. Mrs Hyem leased the site to Jessie Robertson, Elizabeth Robertson and Annie Ellie McAndrew, spinsters, who converted the house to \\"Wootten Private Hospital\\", a psychiatric facility. Jessie Robertson became the owner of the property in 1918. Before 1919 an operating theatre block was added on the southern side of the house. Jessie leased the hospital to Florence Inglis, Elizabeth Fraser and Annie Paton, spinsters and nurses, in February 1920. They then purchased the property in June 1927. In 1935 an additional two-storey wing was built next to the operating theatre. In 1936 there were some minor alterations and additions to the 1935 rear wing and a seven bedroom nurses' residence was built in the grounds to the north of the house. In 1939 the hospital had 27 bedrooms. The hospital was purchased in early 1948 by Lillian Ross West, the Matron, who lived at Randwick, and it was then purchased by Winchester Hospital in 1949 and they operated \\"Winchester Private Hospital\\" on the site. Hugo Holdings purchased the site in 1968 and operated \\"Hughlings Private Hospital\\" until 1977. Major alterations were made in 1969, including the enclosure of the verandahs, and the modification of most internal and external doors to comply with Board of Health requirements. Many mansions were demolished in Darlinghurst between 1920 and 1940 and replaced by terraced houses and flats. The use of Iona as a hospital saved it from this fate. In 1973 the site was purchased by developers, Cascais, Westport Holdings and Inciti Developments, who also purchased many surrounding houses. They sought approval for three 60 storey tower block home units in the area. Consent was granted in May 1977 which included a lesser scale development and the conversion of Iona into 13 strata units. The developers suffered financial problems and each property was sold to individual owners. The National Trust of Australia was against the loss of Iona and the property development of the area and in 1976 the National Trust classified Iona as part of the Darley Street Group. The Darley Street Group was also listed on the Register of the National Estate. Iona, post-1979 The gates at the Tewkesbury Avenue entrance The subject site was purchased from Home Units of Australia by Jesseme P/L in December 1979. The company was owned by John Rutherford who renamed the building Iona, and he asked his architect to prepare plans for the conversion of the building into 15 flats. John and Gae Rutherford then lived there. The proposal did not proceed, and in October 1980 South Sydney Council approved an application for restoration of the building as a single dwelling. Rutherford applied to the Heritage Council for funding assistance for restoration works and $20,000 was granted. Rutherford himself became owner in 1983 and continued restoration. At this time the house was rewired, replumbed and reguttered and unsympathetic additions and alterations were removed (e.g. enclosed verandahs).Urbis, 2010, 5 To enhance the setting, the former nurses' quarters building north of the house was demolished in 1984. New entrance gates and pillars in the northern boundary fence were added around 1992 (to Tewkesbury Avenue).

The new buyers are Tim Eustace and partner Salvatore Panui, who had bought Lyndhurst in Glebe in 2005, did further restoration of that house and sold it in 2016.Macken, 2-3/4/16  Description  Residence Iona is a 22-room house, freestanding, one of a handful of such mansions left in Darlinghurst. The existing dwelling is located towards the southern end of the site. A two- storey, with basement, late Victorian villa known as Iona. It is constructed of rendered brick with a slate roof, two storey verandah and has been altered and added to a number of times. The dwelling was constructed around 1888 and replaced an earlier single storey timber cottage called Iona on the site. In the early 20th century the dwelling was converted for use as a private hospital. The hospital use continued through to 1977, and numerous alternations and additions were undertaken as part of this use. In the 1970s the site and a number of surrounding sites were acquired for redevelopment with Iona retained. The development never proceeded and the place was restored in the 1980s with a proposal to convert it to a boutique hotel, which did not proceed. Garden Iona today is on a lot of 2,700 square metres. It retains a remnant garden of reduced area on the western side of the house, bounded in the south by tall gates to Darley Street and a tall fence to Tewkesbury Avenue in the north. The site is irregular in shape and is located at the end of Darley Street with a second frontage to Tewkesbury Avenue; towards which the principal elevation or northern facade is oriented. The site is oriented north south with the east and west boundaries adjoining the neighbouring properties. The existing dwelling is located towards the southern end of the site. The site is bounded by a high sandstone fence. The main entry is through cast iron palisade gates from Darley Street with a second access point from Tewkesbury Avenue on the boundary through recently constructed large solid iron gates. The northern and western portions of the site are not built upon and feature the grassed front yard and paved circular driveway respectively. The front yard features large mature trees along the boundaries and is predominantly grassed with some garden beds and some low sandstone walling around the edges. A grotto style garden with sandstone walls and a circular centre feature is located in the north eastern corner of the site. Between the rear southern elevation of the dwelling and the boundary fence is a recently landscaped yard featuring stone paving, garden beds and a fountain. A large Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) in the garden overhands the Tewkesbury Avenue boundary wall.Stuart Read, pers.comm.

Its form, use of materials and detailing, particularly the highly ornate cornices provide the building with its high aesthetic value with such cornices being relatively rare due to their excellent quality. Iona is associated with prominent businessmen and public figures of the time. Historically the place was also adapted for use as a private hospital for many years. The original dwelling is largely intact although much of the original detailing and joinery has been reconstructed following its institutional use.City Plan Heritage, Heritage Impact Statement July 2006 Iona was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Early career  Walter the Chancellor's contemporaneous chronicle is one of the principal sources of Robert's life. A later author, Usama ibn Munqidh, also mentioned Robert in his Kitab al-I'tibar, because he regarded Robert's life as a good example of bizarre occurrences in human lives. Robert's origin and early life is unknown. Robert was first mentioned in two charters of the ruler of Antioch, Roger of Salerno in 1108. Both documents referred to him as one of Roger's barons. Robert received Zardana from Roger, most probably after the crusaders occupied the fortress in 1111. Located to the east of the Orontes River, Zardana was one of the most important border forts in the principality. Robert must have possessed Zardana when he granted a nearby village, Merdic (identified as Mardikh in Syria), to the Abbey of Our Lady of Josaphat in 1114. His grant was confirmed by Roger. Usama recorded that Robert was befriended by atabeg (or regent) of Damascus, Toghtekin, and they agreed not to attack each other's lands.  Powerful baron  Saone The Seljuk general Bursuq ibn Bursuq captured the important border fortress of Kafartab on around 3 September 1115. Bursuq started to build siege engines, most probably in preparation for an attack against Zardana. His emerging power menaced the independence of the Muslim rulers of Syria. Toghtekin and the Artuqid emir, Ilghazi, made an alliance with Roger and promised to lead reinforcements to him. Robert accompanied Ilghazi to Apamea where the crusader troops and their Muslim allies were assembling. Roger and his Muslim allies route Bursuq in the Battle of Sarmin on 14 September. The Antiochene troops captured a series of fortresses near the coast between 1115 and 1119. Saone was captured before 1118, Balatanos in 1118. Roger granted both castles most probably soon to Robert, because Usama referred to Robert as \\"the lord of Saone, Balatanos and the adjoining region\\". Ilghazi almost annihilated the Antiochene army in the Battle of the \\"Field of Blood\\" on 28 June 1119. Since Roger died fighting in the battlefield, Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Pons of Tripoli hurried to Antioch in July to defend the principality. The Antiochene barons elected Baldwin II as regent and he promised to protect their estates. Baldwin II ordered the local troops to assemble at Antioch. Robert obeyed the summons and left Zardana for Antioch. Ilghazi laid siege Zardana and captured it on 12 August. Learning of the siege of his fortress, William tried to convince Baldwin II to relieve his fortress. He hurried back to Zardana, but he fell off his horse and was captured by Ilghazi's troops. Robert was taken to Damascus where he offered 10,000 dinars as ransom to Toghtekin. However, he refused to convert to Islam for which Toghtekin beheaded him. His skull was decorated with jewels and Toghtekin used it as a drinking cup. Robert's sons, William of Zardana and Garenton of Saone inherited his estates. Robert's descendants possessed Saone until it was captured by Saladin in 1188.

Independent women activists in Malaysia first started to come together to organise against VAW. Their objective was to create a violence-free society. Physical and sexual violence against women can occur in various forms such as domestic violence, sexual violence, and emotional violence. In Malaysia, government departments and NGOs such as the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development and Women's Aid Organisation provides help for women.  Types   Domestic violence  Domestic violence, also called as Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), is any behaviour by a current or former partner or spouse that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm. A study conducted by Universiti Sains Malaysia‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Development Research Centre (Kanita) in 2014 shows that there are 9% of ever-partnered women in Peninsular Malaysia experienced domestic violence at some point in their lifetime. WAO‚Äôs statistics on violence against women shows that domestic violence have increased from 2000 to 2018. In 2000, there have been 3468 cases of domestic violence. While in 2018, the number increased to 5513. Women‚Äôs Aid Organisation (WAO) executive director Sumitra Visvanathan suggested that Malaysia principle should strengthened in this area and perceived it as a serious crime in order to reduce unwanted fatalities.  Female circumcision  Female circumcision, also known as FGM, (berkhatan) is practised in Malaysia. In 2009, the Fatwa Committee of the National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs declared that FGM to be compulsory (wajib) for all Muslim women. FGM is a practice that has been the subject of a vigorous policy of zero tolerance from the World Health Organisation (WHO). The issue of such legislative is perceived as ‚Äúa step backwards‚Äù in the fight for women's rights. Historically, the practice of FGM was linked to the coming of Islam and FGM procedures deeply connected to Islam, Islamic notions of body purity in Malaysia and Malay ethnicity. In Malaysia, few people have any specific information and expressed little concern with regard to the practice of FGM in Malaysia. A study conducted in 2012, by Dr. Maznah Dahlui, an associate professor at the University of Malaya‚Äôs Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, found that 93 percent of Muslim women surveyed had been circumcised. Most Muslim women are circumcised because of religious reasons. A recent survey by Salleha Khalid et al in 2016 of 402 Malay-Muslim women revealed that only a mere 4% ‚Äì 16 out of 402 women ‚Äì had not been ‚Äúcircumcised‚Äù. In recent years, there are a rising call from organisations such as the UN for abolition of FGM practices in Malaysia. One of it was from the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee that called for Malaysia to end FGM practices. However, some defended the practice by saying that it would culturally insensitive to abolish FGM completely in Malaysia and arguing that ‚ÄúFGM practised by the Malay community in north Malaysia is not the same as the FGM performed elsewhere‚Äù.  Rape  From 2000 to 2007, there have been an increase of rape cases in all 15 states of Malaysia from 1217 to 3098. Among all 15 states in Malaysia, Johor has the highest rape cases as of May 2017. Based on the statistics released by the Penang Women Centre for Change, one woman is being raped every 35 minutes in Malaysia. In Malaysia, Section 376 of the Penal Code states that whoever commits rape shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty years, and shall be liable to whipping.  Marital rape  Marital Rape is not legally recognised but the new Section 375A states that any husband causing fear of death or hurt to his wife in order to have sex shall be punished for term which may extend to five years. However, marital rape is not criminalised in Malaysia. Since marital rape is not recognised as a crime in Malaysia, it is difficult for women to get access to justice. In a WAO report titled ‚ÄúPerspectives on Domestic Violence‚Äù released on International Women's Day on March 8, the NGO said that rape was a crime even if it occurred in a marriage. The report noted that the United Nations Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, since 2006, had been asking the Malaysian government to criminalise marital rape.  Legislation  Women in Malaysia have certain protection against domestic violence such as the Domestic Violent Act 1994 and Article 375 of the Penal Code (prohibition of rape).  Domestic Violence Act  The Domestic Violence Act took over 10 years to be passed as a law in 1995. This was because when various women's NGO pushed for the enactment, they were met with a lot of resistance by the patriarchal forces of the state. The Domestic Violence Act provides extensive provisions relating to protective orders (POs) which can be issued by the courts. These include provisions on: a) Issuance of interim POs pending investigation of any alleged domestic violence offence prohibiting the person against whom the order is made from using domestic violence against the spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult or any other member of the family; b) Issuance of POs prohibiting the person against whom the order is made from using domestic violence against the spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult or any other member of the family during the course of any proceedings before the court involving a complaint of domestic violence; and c) Attaching of additional orders to the protection order.  Article 375 of the Penal Code  According to the Malaysian law and statutory, the minimum age of consent to participation in sexual activity is 16 years old. The Malaysia statutory rape law is violated when an individual has consensual sexual contact with a person under age 16. Section 375 of the Penal Code (Malaysia), which covers rape states that (a) against her will; (b) without her consent; (c) with her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or hurt to herself or any other person, or obtained under a misconception of fact and the man knows or has reason to believe that the consent was given in consequence of such misconception; (d) with her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married or to whom she would consent; (e) with her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent; (f) with her consent, when the consent is obtained by using his position of authority over her or because of professional relationship or other relationship of trust in relation to her; (g) with or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age. Explanation - Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape. Exception - Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife by a marriage which is valid under any written law for the time being in force, or is recognized in Malaysia as valid, is not rape. Explanation 1 - A woman - (a) living separately from her husband under a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi not made absolute; or (b) who has obtained an injunction restraining her husband from having sexual intercourse with her, shall be deemed not to be his wife for the purposes of this section. Explanation 2‚ÄîA Muslim woman living separately from her husband during the period of ‚Äòiddah, which shall be calculated in accordance with Hukum Syara‚Äô, shall be deemed not to be his wife for the purposes of this section.  Incidents of violence against women  In 3 September 2016, two women found guilty of attempting to have sex was caned in Terengganu, a conservative north-eastern state in Malaysia, ruled by the Islamist opposition party Pan- Malaysian Islamist Party (PAS). It received criticisms from various rights groups such as Justice for Sisters and the Women's Aid Organisation in Malaysia. It had also received criticisms from global organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, arguing that it was a violation of human rights. Malaysian officials justified the sentence by claiming it was ‚Äúnot painful‚Äù and had been intended to ‚Äúeducate‚Äù the women.  Consequences  A recent study had identified the pattern of help-seeking by women who have experienced intimate partner violence and their level of satisfaction with the help they receive. It shows that women who experienced IPV suffered various physical and mental health consequences. 81.8% of women participated in this study reported being physically injured, while more that half reported high emotional distress. The majority of women seek help through friends and family. There were also 13.1% that did not tell anyone about the violence they experienced. This shows that not all survivors report their abuse.  Access to justice for female victims of violence (Organisations)  There are over 10000 NGOs in Malaysia, however only women's NGOs that would voice their concern about women and gender issues. Some women NGOs includes Women's Aid Organisation, All Women's Action Society and Sisters in Islam.  Women's Aid Organisation (Pertubuhan pertolongan wanita)  One objective of the Women's Aid Organisation (WOA) is to provide on request to women and their children suffering from mental, physical and sexual abuse, temporary refuge services that empower and enable them to determine their own future. Recently, WOA launched ‚ÄòThink I Need Aid‚Äô for women survivors to report domestic violence through Whatsapp. This campaign had increased the number of reports from 699 in 2016 to 1698 in 2017. This increase in number was due to survivors being more comfortable reaching out through Whatsapp.  All Women's Action Society (AWAM)  AWAM is a non-profit, independent feminist organisation in Malaysia committed to ending gender-based violence and upholding equality and rights for all. It was established in 1998. some recent events that AWAM had organized in 2018 focusing on violence against women were: * 4 June 2018: Workshop on Violence Against Women (VAW) and Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) for UTAR 4th Year Medical Students * 28 April 2018: Unity and Equality Workshop * 7 April 2018: Break the Silence: A workshop on Violence Against Women/Girls and Speaking U  Sisters In Islam  Sisters In Islam (SIS), formed in 1987, was initially a research, policy, and advocacy organisation based in Kuala Lumpur. Since then, SIS has become a strong force in advocating Muslim women's right in the presence of Islamic revivalism and Islamisation government policies. SIS strives to strike a balance between secular modernity and Islam. SIS had also confronted a variety of major issues including violence against women, women's equality and Islam, Islamic criminal law, and rape. In 1991, SIS had promoted two booklets entitled Are Women and Men Equal Before Allah and Are Muslim Men allowed to Beat Their Wives?, both of which were products of extensive, independent research and interpretation of the Qur‚Äôan. These booklets have provided Qur‚Äôanic interpretations on the issue of domestic violence. In addition, SIS was one of the women's NGOs that worked to get the Domestic Violence Act to pass.  Activism against violence   Community Walk the Talk to Stop Violence Against Women by WOA  This program includes talks and workshops about how women and girls can try to protect themselves and avoid becoming victims of physical violence and cyber crimes. such as Master Saiful Hamiruzzam and team spoke and demonstrated about ‚ÄúHow to Be Your Own Bodyguard‚Äù, and Cathryn Anila spoke on ‚ÄúHow to Surf Online Safely (SOS)‚Äù One workshop was also organised by NCWO targeted for the children aged 9 to 18 years on the subject, ‚ÄúThe Malaysia We Want for our Family and Country‚Äù.  One Stop Crisis Centre (OSCC)  OSCC is a service provider at all government general hospitals in Malaysia. The objectives of OSCC are to provide the following services to assist victimized survivors who have been physically abused, sexually abused either raped or sodomized.

The roles of Vietnamese women  Unidentified Vietnamese women and children before being killed in the My Lai Massacre, 1968 There is relatively little data about female Vietnam War veterans. The VMF (Vietnam Women‚Äôs Memorial Foundation) has estimated that around 11,000 Vietnamese women served their country during the Vietnam War, all of which were likely volunteers. They served in a variety of roles, but most of the women serving in South Vietnam were trained as nurses and government office clerks. For the Viet Cong women, they usually worked as truck drivers or were sent across the border to smuggle goods and equipment. A number of civilian Vietnamese women also served as volunteers for the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services or other humanitarian organisations. While Vietnamese women were active in combat, particularly women in the Viet Cong, the women most impacted were the civilian casualties. Dead woman from the My Lai massacre One infamous and horrific attack on civilian women occurred in March 1968 ‚Äì the My Lai massacre. Over 500 unarmed men, women and children were mercilessly slain in the hamlet of Sorn Tinh (South Vietnam) by American Soldiers. Women and young girls were first raped and tortured by groups of American soldiers before being killed. The cause of the Vietnam War started out as essentially a civil war, the North against the South. Northern Vietnam was run by a Communist government, lead by Ho Chi Minh. In order to gain popularity and enhance social equity, the North Vietnamese Government imposed new laws banning wife-beating, forced marriages and child marriages. In addition, they also focused on the roles of women outside of the traditional home for the purpose of industrial growth and development. As a result of this, North Vietnamese women were seen as essential participants, and were enlisted into the Viet Cong for the purposes of combat and manual labour. Smaller, more nimble women were often sent into the combat zone to lay booby- traps and to spy on the American‚Äôs and the South Vietnamese army. For the purposes of manual labour, many women were sent to work and manage the Ho Chi Minh trail to ensure that food, supplies and heavy artillery had clear passage. In addition, North Vietnamese women worked in rice fields in both North Vietnam and Viet-Cong held farming areas in the South in order to provide food and shelter for advancing Viet Cong forces. During the war, the Vietnamese men were losing morale. The military decided that they would recruit women who had been youth volunteers before to drive truck loads of soldiers up and down the Ho Chi Minh trail while American pilots were dropping bombs from the sky. The purpose of this was to show the male soldiers that if women can do it, you can stick it out In addition, Vietnamese civilian women were subject to further sexual assaults during the breadth of the conflict, and much like the Korean War, they were used as ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù and prostitutes. In 1990, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery was established by nearly 40 progressive women‚Äôs rights organisations in order to address the issue of comfort women and sex slaves kept for the Imperial Japanese Army. Over time, the council pledged that its long-term goal is to review all historical instances of sexual slavery within militaries to prevent any further sexual abuse of women during wartime. In March 2012, on International Women‚Äôs Day, the council established the Butterfly Fund ‚Äì a not for profit organisation that helps women who have been used and abused by military forces in times of war. Since its establishment, the fund had been providing support to victims of sexual violence in the Congo Civil War and the children born as a result of that violence. In 2013, the fund began its campaign to support the women assaulted in the Vietnam War. The Butterfly Fund‚Äôs symbol ‚Äì a butterfly ‚Äì represents the hope of sexual assault survivors and the hope of other women that women will be freed from oppression, discrimination and violence and that one day all women and girls will be free to spread their wings.  The roles of American women  Five enlisted women and a female officer in the Air Force (WAF) arrive at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam. June, 1967 Vietnam War Women's Memorial on the National Mall, Washington DC The majority of the American women that served in Vietnam were trained, graduate nurses. Most were fresh out of college and had volunteered their service, while other, more experienced nurses were sent to Vietnam to assist in training many South Vietnamese women. The first group of the Army Nurse Corps arrived in Vietnam in 1956, and by 1973 nearly 5000 American women would be serving in Vietnam. Only five of them died during the war, two of which were posthumously awarded bravery medallions ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Annie Ruth Graham had previously served in World War II and the Korean War while First Lieutenant Sharon Lane had previously served in Korea. Graham died in 1968 after suffering a stroke, and Lane died shortly after from injuries sustained after an attack on the hospital where she had been stationed. Lane was later also awarded a posthumous Vietnamese Gallantry Cross with Palm and the Vietnamese Bronze Star for Heroism. In addition to on the ground nurses, there were some women who served as Naval and Air Force Nurses. The first members of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps arrived in Saigon in 1963, and were awarded the Purple Heart after they were injured during a Christmas Eve bombing in Saigon by the Viet Cong. They were the first female Americans to be awarded for their bravery. During the Vietnam War, eight WAF (Women‚Äôs Airforce) Nurses died during conflict. During the Vietnam War, there were only nine women who served in a role other than a nurse, including Lieutenant Elizabeth Wylie, who worked as a Commander of Naval Forces in the Vietnam Command Information Centre alongside Commander Elizabeth Barret who become the first female naval line officer to hold command in an official combat zone.  Women of other nationalities  Charge Sister Pam Miley, a Royal New Zealand Nursing Corps Sister at an orphanage in Vung Tau, Headquarters of the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group, 1971. Other than American and Vietnamese women, a small number of Australian nurses were stationed in Vietnam, while non-medically trained women were sent to volunteer with the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. In addition to Australia, Canada sent a significant amount of re-enforcements to Vietnam on behalf of the Americans. By the end of the war, some 30,000 Canadian citizens had volunteered their service, and nearly 140 of them had been killed in action. It is unknown how many of these 30,000 were women, but not all 30,000 had directly served in combat. Canada‚Äôs main role during the conflict was for the purposes of peacekeeping and monitoring the cease-fire agreements made during the Paris Peace Conference.

She is the first Indigenous person appointed to the National Catholic Education Commission, and has brought Indigenous issues to the forefront at the United Nations and International Interfaith Forums. Hendriks is an elder at the Cleveland Murri Court. She is also a Catholic theologian and has written extensively on the conjunction of Aboriginal spirituality and Christianity.  Biography   Early life  Joan Hendriks was born in 1936 in Brisbane, Queensland, and raised in the suburb of Bulimba. She is the eldest of four children, with her mother being an Aboriginal woman, and her father of Irish-American descent. Hendriks attended Saints Peter and Paul‚Äôs Catholic Primary School in Bulimba as a young girl, and in 1947 she began studying at Lourdes Hill College in Brisbane, Queensland, which she was later appointed as an elder in residence. Her mother was part of one of the first Aboriginal groups in Queensland, Australia to be moved to a mission station on Stradbroke Island, Australia. Growing up, Hendriks struggled with balancing the two different cultures of which she was a member: Christianity and Aboriginal spirituality. Alongside this, Hendriks struggled to live as a daughter of a mixed-race marriage and witnessed the segregation of her parents from the Catholic church. As an Aboriginal woman, Hendriks felt as though her early life was dominated by Western ideals and social constructs, and sought her connection to her Aboriginality through her mother and Stradbroke Island.  Marriage and children  Hendriks is married with four children.  Education  Hendriks completed a degree at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia in the 1980s. She began her PhD in Theology at age 68. In a Western society this seems late to begin studying, but in her Aboriginal culture it is appropriate as with age comes wisdom, balance and trust. She graduated in 2008 and is currently completing her doctorate at the Australian Catholic University.  Work  In the past, Hendriks has presented many workshops at primary schools, secondary schools, churches, local community organisations, and universities on the borderlands between Christianity and Aboriginal spirituality. In the 1980s she worked in the field of Aboriginal Education and Reconciliation and Justice for the Indigenous peoples of Australia. In 2004 she spoke internationally at the United Nations Indigenous Peoples Forums. She has also spoken at the United Nations Interfaith Forums on Aboriginal spirituality and Christianity. She has previously worked with Gerald Hall, a theologian and Catholic priest. He is now her mentor and friend. She currently works at the Australian Catholic University where she is a sessional lecturer in both the Diploma in Indigenous Education and the Bachelor of Primary Education (Indigenous Studies). As a sign of respect, many people - including her students - call her Aunty Joan. Her work remains an important aspect in her life as she uses it as a forum for discussion between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians without resentment or tension.  Philosophical and/or political views  Hendriks was raised with a Catholic background and continues to practice Christianity. She uses her spirituality to pave the way for other Christian Aboriginal Australians and continues to teach others how to find a balance between the two, speaking of both having equal parts of her soul. Hendriks promotes acceptance and understanding, believing that we should listen to one another‚Äôs stories to acknowledge, accept and move through past experiences. Hendriks values family greatly, stating that ‚Äú your family and where you come from creates a powerful interactive process that realizes an interconnected relationship with the great spirit of our dreaming‚Äù.  Published Works  Hendriks published many works alone and with others, as well as participated as a special guest in media projects. In 2006, Hendriks published Moving the Way Forward on the Australasian Catholic Record. Collaborating with her friend and mentor Gerald Hall, Hendriks participated in Spirit of Religion: A Project for Meeting and Dialogue directed by Raimon Panikkar.Hendriks, J. & Hall, G. (2011).

She is best known for her 1965 action at the Regatta Hotel where she and Rosalie Bogner chained themselves to a bar rail to protest the exclusion of serving women in public bars in Queensland, Australia. Women's rights and social justice are threads linking Thornton's diverse range of pursuits and projects, including the 1965 founding of the Equal Opportunities Association for Women, helping establish the first Women's Studies course at the University of Queensland in 1973, and contributing to feminist and social theory literature.  Education  Thornton graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from the University of Sydney in 1952 and studied Philosophy as a post-graduate at the University of Queensland.  Feminist activism and career  Thornton was involved in feminist activism beginning in the mid-1960s, including the notable Regatta Hotel protest in March 1965 that challenged women's exclusion from public bars in Queensland. In 1970 the law was changed to allow women to drink in public bars in Queensland. In April of the same year, Thornton founded the Equal Opportunities for Women Association in Brisbane. As President of the association, Thornton led a successful campaign for the removal of the marriage bar in the Commonwealth and State Public Services. The end of the marriage bar was legislated in 1966. From 1960 to 1980, Thornton worked as an academic in a variety of positions within Philosophy, Government, Sociology and Gender Studies at the University of Queensland (UQ). During her time there, Thornton helped to establish the first Women's Studies course in Queensland in the UQ's Sociology Department in 1973.  Regatta Hotel protest  In March 1965, Thornton and Rosalie Bogner chained themselves to the bar rail of the Regatta Hotel in Toowong, Brisbane as a protest to the exclusion of serving women in pubs. The women were refused service as serving them liquor would have resulted in a fine for the pub. However, ‚Äúsympathetic male patrons‚Äù brought them beer. In Archiving the feminist self: reflections on the personal papers of Merle Thornton, Margaret Henderson notes that the protest ‚Äúoccurred four years before the first women‚Äôs liberation group met in Australia.‚Äù The protest marked the beginning of second wave feminist action in Brisbane and gained significant media coverage. Thornton and Bogner's protest, which addressed the public-private split for women, is recognised as a defining moment in the women's liberation movement in Australia. Kay Saunders notes, \\"when you use the term ‚Äò‚Äòsecond wave‚Äô‚Äô it actually started in Brisbane.\\" Thornton stated, \\"What we did at the Regatta represented an idea whose time had come. It was the idea of ending the confinement of women to the private domestic world.\\" The public's reaction to the protest was mixed. Thornton received hate-mail letters accusing her of being a communist, questioned her mothering capabilities, and cast doubts on her morality. In 2014, the Regatta Hotel celebrated the protest with the naming of Merle's Bar. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the 1965 Regatta Hotel protest was announced as a ‚ÄúQ150 Icon‚Äù under the category of a \\"Defining Moment\\" for Queensland. Thornton campaigned for women's issues throughout her life including demanding equal pay for women and removing the marriage bar for women in public service.  Creative pursuits  Thornton has also achieved accomplishments as a screenwriter, playwright and author. Thornton's screenwriting appears on several episodes of the popular Australian television series Prisoner. Thornton's stage play, Playing Mothers and Fathers, had a successful season at the Carlton Courthouse in 1990. In the 1980s and 1990s, Thornton served as Chair of Women in Film and Television and Victorian Chair of the Australian Writers‚Äô Guild. Thornton published her first novel, After Moonlight, in 2004. Thornton also contributed in academics to the field of feminist and social theory. Thornton's current research interests include philosophy, the politics of the advancement of women, Aboriginal thought, and the education of Aboriginal Australians.

It was proposed by a collective of prominent American feminists in an appeal published in Viewpoint Magazine in February 2017, and built upon the mobilisation of women seen in the 2017 Women‚Äôs March in January. The appeal simultaneously called for an International Women‚Äôs Strike on 8 March 2017. It is a successor to the accumulated intellectual legacy of feminist movements such as radical feminism, Marxist feminism, Black feminism and transnational/decolonial feminism, and asserts that gender oppression is not caused by a single factor, sexism. They insist that it is rather a multifaceted product of the intersections of sexism, racism, colonialism and capitalism. Background The demand for a Feminism of the 99% was published in Viewpoint Magazine on the 30th of February 2017. It was made in response to the mass mobilisation of women seen in the 2017 Women‚Äôs March ‚Äì a worldwide protest on 21 January 2017, protesting the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States and advocating for women‚Äôs rights, human rights and policy reform. The authors cite the Argentinian movement Ni Una Menos as their inspiration, as it too is a fourth-wave grassroots movement which aims to address intersectional issues. Aiming to build on the momentum of the Women‚Äôs March, the authors call attention to what they see as the failures of contemporary feminist movements such as lean-in feminism, which they argue have failed the ‚Äúoverwhelming majority‚Äù of women who ‚Äúdo not have access to individual self-promotion and advancement and whose conditions of life can be improved only through policies that defend social reproduction, secure reproductive justice, and guarantee labor rights‚Äù. They further argue that the conditions of life of women have deteriorated over the last 30 years due to corporate globalisation and capitalist systems, especially those of colour, of working class, of migrant backgrounds or who are unemployed.  Key criticisms and demands  F99 criticises other contemporary feminist movements, such as lean-in feminism and corporate feminism, for only serving the privileged top 1% of women. It holds the logic that women are able to succeed in their career as long as they work to serve the benefit of the patriarchy, and that this relies on these women having access to resources and opportunities that most women are unable to access. The authors of the appeal recognise the need for a feminist movement which serves the needs of the many, and calls attention to the women who are overlooked by neoliberal feminism. However, they call for the movement to look beyond just issues of gender, criticising a number of key issues and movements including: racialized gender violence, the failings of neoliberalism, attacks on labour rights and the undervaluing of labour; reproductive injustices; homophobia; transphobia; and xenophobia. The aim of the movement is to contribute to what its creators see as a ‚Äúa new international feminist movement with an expanded agenda‚Äìat once anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-heterosexist, and anti-neoliberal‚Äù. Authors of the manifesto * Angela Davis * Barbara Ransby * Cinzia Arruzza * Keeanga- Yamahtta Taylor * Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff * Nancy Fraser * Rasmea Yousef Odeh * Tithi Bhattacharya Related Movements Feminism of the 99% has ideological groundings consistent with different but distinct feminist groups. Best understood as a rejection of a perceived failure of mainstream liberal feminism, Feminism of the 99% seeks to combine the positions of anti-racism, anti-sexism, and anti-neoliberalism. In doing so Feminism of the 99% is linked very closely to existing feminist movements globally.  Intersectional Feminist Thought  Intersectional feminist thought holds that the lived experience of oppression cannot simply be observed through a single lens of identity: that it‚Äôs the combinations of identity expressions, and the kind of experience afforded together that provide a more accurate picture of the hierarchies under which one operates. Intersectionality considers that various forms of social stratification, such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together. Feminism for the 99% embraces this framework on a fundamental level, and purports that meaningful change must originate from those who experience it firsthand.  Black Feminism  Black feminism is a school of thought stating that sexism, class oppression, gender identity and racism are inextricably bound together. Naturally, this closely aligns with feminism for the 99% given their simultaneous use of intersectionality. A point of difference between the two movement is that feminism for the 99% has a defined strategy for change, taking inspiration from Ni Una Menos.  Socialist Feminism  Socialist feminism is feminism that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the patriarchy and capitalism. Feminism of the 99% frequently parallels with Socialist Feminism given their similar critical assessments of capitalism, and the role of domestic work and social reproduction theory. Angela Davis, as one of the keystone ideological sources of feminism for the 99%‚Äôs ideological perspective holds liberal feminism in contempt for its failure to address the concerns of women perceived to be betrayed by their class position: ‚ÄúIf standards for feminism are created for those who have already ascended the economic hierarchies of feminism, how is this relevant to women at the bottom?‚Äù. In other words: Davis criticises liberal feminists for acting primarily in the interests of women privileged from race-based and class-based disadvantage. Tithi Bhattacharya, another key signatory of the feminism for the 99% manifesto, has expanded on social reproduction theory within the context of gender, providing a marxist analysis of gender disparate divisions of labor as an integral part of the capitalist mode of production. Specifically, Bhattacharya suggests that the unpaid acts of childbirth, child-rearing, and domestic duties are themselves acts of productive labor, acted within an as exploitative context consistent with marxist labor theory. A key point, is that these acts are disparately the role of women. In stark contrast to Liberal Feminism, feminism for the 99% holds that effective and meaningful change comes from a non-reformist perspective: that revolutionary change necessitates a more utopian vision. Feminism for the 99% holds that incremental adjustment of an existing unjust and oppressive hierarchy will never precipitate a just society. To this end, a change from the ground up is required.  Ni Una Menos  The Feminism of the 99% manifesto specifically cites Ni Una Menos as a source of inspiration for the movement. Specifically, the use of a mass strike of all women as the main form of political activism. On 8 March 2017 (International Women‚Äôs Day), activists across the feminist continuum organised the International Women‚Äôs Strike (known in the US as the Day Without Women), and the 2017 Women‚Äôs March. The 2017 Women‚Äôs Day March was the largest single day protest in US history. References Category:Feminism ","title":"Feminism of the 99%"},{"id":"58864455","text":"Erika S.

She was a professor at Waseda University, and the former director of the institute for Ryukyuan and Okinawan studies. Katsukata was born in Uruma City in Okinawa Prefecture. Katsukata received the 24th the Okinawa Bunka Kyokai Award (Zenchu Nakahara Award) in 2002. She specializes in Contemporary American Literature, Gender studies, Okinawan Studies and Ethnicity Studies.

She was so fascinated by the world of women‚Äôs literature that she compiled the book that acquaints 300 female writers. She devoted herself to accomplishment of women editors in 1920s, as she stated that she even thought that a topic of her life work had been found.  Gender studies  As Katukata described her own fate \\"was to never have my interests remain in one area,\\" her focus gradually transformed into gender studies. In 1993, she started to be in charge of one of the general education seminars in the School of Law at Waseda University. Around the time, students who had just came back from studying abroad requested that she open a gender theory class. Katsukata decided to teach a seminar called ‚ÄòWomen Studies‚Äô, and was surprised that half of the students were men, which was contrary to her expectations. It was the right timing for starting gender studies, partly because the word, gender, had been started to use in Japanese media, as she observed. Her seminar turned into a lecture called \\"gender studies\\" that was aimed at every student at the university in 1997. 400 students attended the lecture. With that as a start, the university had begun to introduce women studies and gender theory and in 2000, the Gender Studies Institute was established.  Okinawan studies  In 2006, the Institute for Ryukyuan and Okinawan Studies (2006 - 2015) was founded, and Katsukata assumed the position of the director, partly because the university had the relationship with Nobumoto Ohama who was inaugurated the President of Waseda university for 12 years. He was born in Ishigaki Island, which is located in Ryukyu area, and played a significant role in a process of the return of Okinawa from the U.S. Since she was born and raised in Okinawa, Japan, the faculty members at the university asked Katsukata to be responsible for the institute, however, she was not willing to at first. It was because of trauma she was holding as well as the whole community in Okinawa. Katsukata recalled that it was such a load off her mind to move to Tokyo, and get rid of pressure of Okinawa. Whereas, by the time she accepted the offer of the director at the institute, Katsukata realized that her feelings about where she came from began to change. She said that \\"this shift to Okinawan research came from my desire to use theory in order to free myself from the \\"Okinawa\\" that was festering inside me, and to create peace for myself\\". In her last lecture before retirement, Katsukata shared a personal message with her students, reflecting on the experiences of Okinawan women living in the Kanto area. She specifically referred to the rape of a twelve year old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 1995 that had a deep impact on her. A local newspaper, Okinawa Shinpou, reported that Katsukata gave courage to women in Okinawa by her words.

Aerom√©xico later apologized when Mexican news outlets wrote about her tweets. In 2017, a male taxi driver catcalled De Anda, whistling and calling \\"Eh, guapa\\", literally \\"hey beautiful\\".

Women continue to be disproportionately affected by these conflicts and are consistently overlooked in peace negotiations, despite their work on the ground in post-conflict reconstruction, aid and ceasefire negotiations. While women were technically included in the Geneva II peace talks regarding Syria, they were not present during formal negotiations. While women's formal participation in peace negotiations in Myanmar remain low, they still have an important role at the community level and have emerged as ‚Äòfront-line responders‚Äô to the Rohingya situation.  International law mechanisms  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1979, following thirty years‚Äô work undertaken by the UN Commission on the Status of Women to promote women's rights. CEDAW has often been described as an ‚Äòinternational bill of rights‚Äô for women, affirming that human rights includes gender equality. The rights covered in CEDAW include many aspects of women's lives, including women's political participation, education, health, employment, marriage and legal equality. Highlighting the human rights concerns of women, it acknowledges that discrimination against women continues, violating principles of equality and human dignity. In enhancing understanding of human rights, CEDAW recognises the effect of culture and tradition in restrictions on women, calling for a change in understandings of traditional roles of men and women to achieve full gender equality. A relatively recent development in international law directly addressing women in conflict has been the adoption of Resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council on 31 October 2000, affirming the important role women can and do play in the conflict prevention and resolution, peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction. In doing so, the UN Security Council recognized the \\"changing nature of warfare, in which civilians are increasingly targeted.\\" It is unique in that it is the first time the UN Security Council \\"addressed the disproportionate and unique impact of armed conflict on women.\\" UNSCR 1325 urges all actors to increase the participation of women in these processes and to take \\"special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence\\" in conflict situations, such as rape and sexual abuse. Research undertaken since the adoption of UNSCR 1325 has recognised the importance of the involvement of women in peace and security, and is now consolidated under the \\"Women, Peace and Security Agenda.\\" Additionally, evidence collected by UN Women has shown how conflict prevention correlates with gender equality; unfortunately, there are still inadequate actions for women's inclusion and protection in conflict and post-conflict situations. 2016 saw a 20% reduction in peace agreements containing gender-specific provisions, dropping from 70% to 50%.  Democratic Republic of the Congo: Violence against women  The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been described as the \\"rape capital of the world,\\" with commentators going so far as to describe it as a \\"war against women.\\" Women and girls have disproportionately suffered from the DRC conflicts, subjected to crimes such as rape, forced prostitution and forced marriage. The UN Special Rapporteur on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Margot Wallstrom, has raised international awareness of the widespread sexual violence and impunity in the DRC, stating that rape is not cultural, but a crime. Up to six million have been killed in the wars lasting nearly two decades, conflicts with both economic and political effects. Fighting has been sparked by the DRC's mineral wealth, with both sides using the country's instability to \\"plunder natural resources.\\" Crimes against civilians, particularly against women and girls, have been met with impunity as violent conflicts intensify. These acts include gang rape (the majority of cases), public rape, instrumental rape and female genital mutilation. Estimates vary and are compromised by lack of reporting, however by 2011 it was estimated that over 200,000 rapes had been committed over a ten-year period. The UN Population Fund concluded that over 8,000 acts of sexual violence occurred in 2009 and 2010 in the DRC. By 2011, it was estimated that 1 152 women were raped every day, calculated at 48 women per hour. In 2014, reported cases of rape in the DRC were increasing. While gender-based and sexual violence has become endemic in the DRC, it is particularly so in the East, with this violence persisting due to high insecurity. Another reason is the high level of impunity met with acts of sexual assault, as the judicial system is under- resourced and the social status of women in the DRC remains low, to the point that women who are raped are considered worthless. Additionally, displacement, insecurity and continuing conflict only exacerbate violence against women and girls, even by other members of the community as well as armed groups. Since 2006, developments have been made at the national and international levels to directly address violence against women and girls in the DRC. In 2006, the Congolese government adopted a new law providing a legal framework criminalising acts of sexual mutilation, sexual slavery, sexual relations with underage children, and the use of instruments in sexual violence. This has been designed to combat informal settlements between perpetrators and the families of victims, such as forced marriages between the victim and her rapist. The UN has since adopted the Comprehensive Strategy on Combating Sexual Violence in the DRC, focusing on combating impunity; preventing violence; reformation of the security sector; and assistance for survivors. Additionally, the UN Security Council has since adopted Resolutions 1856 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) to condemn sexual violence in conflict situations, building on Resolution 1325 in its advocacy of women's involvement in peace process and post-conflict reconstruction. The sexual violence is more than individual attacks; it is used to destroy communities and families, who would be forced off their land. Women who are raped have no value in Congolese society and are ostracized from their families and communities, as well as dealing with after-effects such as mental and physical health issues and pregnancies. In 2017, the international campaign \\"16 Days of Activism\\" (established 1991) to end violence against women and girls, saw governments, activists, men, women and civil society collectively promote human rights. On November 25, 2017, UN agencies, media, civil society, government officials and students gathered in Kinshasa to launch the 2017 campaign theme \\"Leave No One Behind: End Violence Against Women and Girls.\\" This included school competitions in which students answered questions about the texts and laws designed to protect women and girls from gender-based violence.  Syria: Women's involvement in the peace talks  The Syrian civil war has made Syrian women and girls particularly vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence, marginalisation and poverty. Up to 500 000 deaths have occurred from the crisis, causing unprecedented refugee levels. While both women and men are subjected to gender-based violence, women and girls are disproportionately targeted. Pre-existing gender inequalities put women and girls at greater risk of violence, trafficking, forced marriage and exploitation. Women continue to be under-represented in the Syrian peace negotiations and few women were able to participate in the Geneva II peace talks, although not formally. In 2012, UN Women reviewed 31 peace processes, in which only 4% of peace agreements contained female signatories. A study undertaken by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018 found that between 1990 and 2017, only 19% of peace agreements contained references to women. However, women are leading actors at the local level, addressing the consequences of civil war by assisting internally displaced peoples and survivors of sexual violence, engaging in ‚Äòcross-community dialogue‚Äô and working in factories at their own personal risk. They have led non-violent protests to release detainees, continue to work in field hospitals and schools, distribute aid and supplies, and \\"document human rights violations.\\" Despite this, there is no mechanism to ‚Äòcarry those experiences across into the formal peace negotiations‚Äô. Syrian women have begun to remedy this themselves. On 6 January 2014, the Syrian Women's Charter was created in Damascus, advocating an end to violence and highlighting the need for Syrian unity to create a \\"future Syrian state that will honour its citizens their basic human rights.\\" They have made \\"practical proposals for what civil society participation could look like\\" and have worked together despite political affiliations and personal differences. Additionally, the Syrian Women's Political Movement has been created and aims towards a 30% quota to ensure women's participation in conflict resolution processes. The \\"It Takes a Woman\\" campaign was launched by UN Women in 2017 to raise awareness of Syrian women activists involved in both formal and informal peace processes, highlighting public debate over women's right to participate in the ongoing peace processes.  Myanmar: Rohingya women respond to the ongoing crisis  In western Myanmar, the Rohingya population continues to suffer from mass killings, village destruction and gang rapes perpetrated by Myanmar's security forces The attacks began Myanmar's Rakhine State in August 2017, leading to ongoing violence. Since then, approximately 650 000 people have crossed into neighbouring Bangladesh, with tens of thousands displaced within the Rakhine state. Women and girls have been disproportionately affected, subjects to mutilation, gang rape, forcible detention and burned to death (Refugees International 2018). Exact statistics are unknown, due to difficulties in documentation as well as the social stigma surrounding acts of sexual violence. As in other countries, \\"sexual violence has been used as a weapon against the Rohingya.\\" In the camp in Bangladesh's Cox Bazar, up to 600 000 refugees live in crowded conditions, with girls as young as 11 forced to marry by their families in the hope of acquiring more food. The representation of women in Myanmar's peace talks remains low. In the April 2016 peace talks, women accounted for 13% of the 700 delegates, increasing to 17% in May 2017. Only 4% of the 48-member peace committee were women. Despite their underrepresentation in formal peace processes, Myanmar's women have been \\"driving forces for peace around the world.\\" In the conflict zone, women are \\"emerging as front-line responders', taking care of other women in roles ranging from midwives to caseworkers. While their participation in public life is restricted, women have been the ‚Äòentry point for reaching the whole community with messages about services, safety and human rights.\\" In October 2017, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) called on Myanmar to stop the violence in the Rakhine State and to investigate cases of violence against women and children.

He is the owner and operator of Rossmann Repair Group in New York City, a computer repair shop established in 2007 which specializes in logic board-level repair of MacBooks. Rossmann rose in popularity with his YouTube channel showing his repairs to provide as an educational resource, frequently livestreaming repairs on YouTube, Twitch.tv, and Vimeo. On his YouTube channel he also uploads tutorials on life, business practices, real estate, and right to repair videos. Rossmann has actively campaigned for right to repair legislation to be passed in multiple city and state legislatures. Campaigns On October 8, 2018, CBC News ran an investigative piece on Apple's business practices surrounding repair of their devices. They went undercover in an Apple store with a malfunctioning MacBook Pro looking for a quote on repair. They explained that the screen was simply black and they couldn't see anything on the screen. The Apple store quoted a customer in their undercover video $1200 for a logic board replacement, explaining that the liquid contact indicators (LCIs) turned red, and that only happened when in contact with any type of liquid, so the whole logic board needed to be swapped out, in addition to the top case. When taken to Rossmann's repair shop, Rossmann explained that there was no liquid damage, and that simple room humidity likely set off the LCIs. He also explained that a pin that connected the MacBook Pro's backlight was simply not seated properly. After seating the pin properly, the MacBook Pro was seen working again. Rossmann explained his repair shop would likely not charge for simply re-seating the backlight pin. In 2018, Rossmann testified as witness in a lawsuit from Apple towards an independent smartphone repair shop owner in Norway, Henrik Huseby, regarding right to repair and authorised smartphone parts. The Norwegian court originally sided with Huseby, but ruled in favor of Apple in 2019 after an appeal hearing showed Huseby had been using counterfeit parts.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxzpy/apple-is-still-trying-to-sue- the-owner-of-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-louis-rossmann-henrik- husebyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyo4XbmK1_Q He has also spoken and testified in right to repair hearings in Boston, Maine, Washington State and Nebraska. Rossmann has also appeared in right to repair campaigns related to farming machinery in Nebraska in March 2020. Though he was initially completely against any form of curbs imposed by companies on farmers from repairing their equipment (which might have resulted in voiding the equipment's warranty), he later admitted that his opinions were not completely correct due to him lacking expertise in the field of farming machinery when he received a mail from a John Deere employee regarding how allowing farmers to tune their tracking can result in harm to themselves and possible violation of environmental laws. Rossmann has criticised the design of the third generation MacBook Air. He notes that the fan is not positioned above the CPU, nor connected to it via any radiator circuit, calling it a \\"placebo fan\\" which can easily lead to overheating and damage. Videos On October 18, 2018 Rossmann uploaded a video entitled \\"Apple & Customs STOLE my batteries, that they won't even provide to AASPs\\". In the video, Rossmann explains that U.S. Customs seized his package containing 20 Apple MacBook batteries, worth $1,068 USD, labeling them as counterfeit goods. He claims the sole reason for seizure was the batteries he was importing bore Apple's trademark, and feels it is retribution for the CBC piece, as Rossmann had been importing MacBook batteries for years without incident until shortly after the CBC story was published. On June 5, 2019, Rossmann posted a video on YouTube where he appeared as a key witness in a Norwegian court case, in which Apple Inc. had sued a Norwegian repair shop in an effort to stop them from repairing Apple products.https://itavisen.no/2019/06/07/norske-henrik-moter-apple-i-retten- for-andre-gang-de-vil-knuse-meg/ On June 29, he posted a video explaining the case, in which he explained that the case ended in the court ruled in favor of Apple Inc. as the repair shop in question was using counterfeit parts, a detail Rossmann claims he was not aware of before testifying.Louis Rossmann, , I was wrong about an important case. Let's go over the new information. Several of Rossmann's videos have been removed from YouTube following privacy complaints. These were subsequently revealed to be from lobbyists opposing Right to Repair, and a contractor producing substandard work.

This resulted in the expansion of two distinct trade routes, both of which went through West Africa. One route exported domestically produced cannabis from West Africa to South Africa, Europe, and Asia. The other trade route moved cocaine from Latin America and heroin from Afghanistan and Southeast Asia to Europe and the United States. In both of these routes, drug traffickers took advantage of trading networks created by Malian and Berber traders in colonial times to move drugs through the region and West Africa's broader geographical location as an intermediate stop from Latin America and Southwest Asia to Europe and the United States. This was due in part to West Africa's badly policed borders, endemic corruption, and economic inequalities. At first, the drugs were only smuggled in small quantities, but as time progressed and the demand for drugs kept rising, countries in West Africa‚Äîspecifically Nigeria, Ghana, and Guinea-Bissau‚Äîwere entrusted with cocaine loads as large as 135 to 145 tonnes (according to the UNODC). Since then West Africa has become a key component of the drug trading world, with both the increase in variety and number of drugs trafficked through West Africa and the expansion of the drug trade from West Africa to other parts of the continent. International pressure and prioritization by regional governments has fueled the rise of drug control organizations in many West African countries, shifting the focal point of political, economic, and social domestic action.  History  According to historian Emmanuel Akyeampong, cannabis products in West Africa existed before mid-twentieth century. In 1934 colonial authorities were still testing the cultivation of the coca plant in Calabar and other places in Nigeria. By the mid 1950s police were arresting some Nigerian farmers for growing and selling small amounts of cannabis were being shipped to Europe and the United States. While this was going on, Nigerian cannabis smokers were buying some imported marijuana from South African and Belgian Congo dealers. The first documented use of West Africa as a smuggling post was in 1952, when US officials noticed that a Lebanese syndicate was hiding heroin in West Africa in order to avoid getting caught by police and to avoid the scrutiny of officers on the European trade route. West Africa's rise as a major drug smuggling transit point starts at around the 1960s, when the Beatles and Swinging London were popular, and young men and women in the UK and other parts of Europe wanted illegal drugs. Marijuana was particularly high in demand and reports of the time period stated that of marijuana grown in West Africa was being exported from Nigeria to Europe in large quantities. The drug trade became a problem and the Nigerian government issues a decree stating that anyone found guilty exporting cannabis would get a ten-year jail term. Until the 1980s, many Nigerians and some Ghanaian traders would go out and make trades on their own terms and conditions. The dealers went to places like Latin America or Asia and bought many small packages of drugs (usually cocaine or heroin) and they had couriers go out and sell their drugs. It has been speculated that the origins of mass drug exports started with West African students living in the EU and US who failed to receive payments of their study grants were hired by Nigerian naval officers in training who were stationed in India to deliver the heroin they bought and bring it back to the countries where they resided. After 1982 the US and Europe noticed a rise in Nigerian drug traders in their countries. The US arrested 21 Nigerians for drug offenses, and then many more thereafter. In Europe an official of the West German Interior Ministry reportedly said the following year that Hamburg, Germany was importing a serious amount of drugs from West Africa, including one and a half tonnes of a mystery drug (presumably marijuana) from Ghana.  Demand  From 1998 to 2009, cocaine consumption doubled in Europe, and as a result Latin American drug cartels and West African dealers formed an alliance in order to facilitate drug transportation by taking advantage of the airplanes and boats that enter and leave the coast of West Africa. Drugs were then spread through North America and Europe through localized West African ethnic communities that had the tools and resources to traffic drugs along established networks. Domestic demand for illicit drugs varies for different regions and populations. Use of cheaper substances, like marijuana and a cannabis rooted drink called akpeteshie, fall heavily on working-class and poorer populations. In Ghana, groups like miners, agricultural laborers, and sailors use these substances as a way to cope with the demands of difficult lifestyles or grueling days of labor. Domestic demand for harder drugs such as cocaine and heroine, as well as Mandrax and amphetamines, were traditionally viewed as solely dependent on wealthier populations. However, falling prices of more expensive illicit drugs as well as expanding methods of consumption have made such substances more readily accessible to working-class West Africans, particularly in city centers. The powerful energizing effects of substances like cocaine and amphetamines have made them more attractive to laborers with long, exhaustive workdays as well as students who spend long nights studying. As a result of expanding trends in globalization in recent years, demand for substances, especially harder drugs, has spread to tourists and short-term residents of many West African countries. The expansive drug trafficking routes through West Africa that fuel this high demand are sustained in some part by complicit governmental forces. Unlike routes from Latin America or Asia that have gained growing amounts of attention from international drug enforcers, traders face relatively fewer obstacles in trafficking illicit substances through West Africa. Corruption and political relationships to underground economies fuel a \\"shadow state\\" system where money from drug trafficking funds government actors in their campaigns and financial holdings and politicians gain power and influence based on how they can wield funds from drug trafficking. In this sense, capital and governmental resources generated from the drug trade are also in high demand.  Drug abuse  New markets for illicit substances and a growing acceptance of hard drugs has led to cases of drug abuse throughout West Africa. The United Nations found that in the 1980s and 1990s, drug consumption increased dramatically in youth populations and among the urban poor. Whereas before drug traffickers transported drugs through the West Africa, they now realized they could save money by selling their products within the region. As a result, countries central to West African drug routes‚ÄîNigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau‚Äîhave all seen a rise in domestic drug consumption and abuse. In countries like Nigeria, there are few government health and rehabilitation services available, leaving addicts and their families to deal with adverse health effects and the socioeconomic consequences on their own. As the locus of concern for drug control organizations has shifted to the supply of drugs to Western countries, less attention has been given to domestic demand and consumption. Most West African countries do not have sufficient services or policies put in place to properly run substance abuse and local anti-drug campaigns. Controlling the flow of drugs out of the region has taken priority over regulating drug trafficking within West African countries. Increasing rates of substance abuse have intensified other issues within West Africa including the spread of HIV and AIDS, higher rates of prostitution, and larger urban poor populations who are economically immobilized by a reliance on drugs. Drug abuse within families has shown lasting cross-generational effects on urban youth and catalyzed a quicker spread of drug addiction along with higher rates of depression and anxiety. The Casamance conflict in Senegal is an example of how the growing domestic demand for substances has additionally created financial opportunity for insurgent groups within the region, leading to further political instability.  Supply  Due to the rising demand of illegal drugs and the rising profits from illicit drugs following the mid-1980s, West Africans branched out of Africa and created outposts in big cities all across the world in order to establish effective drug trading networks. An estimated quarter to two-thirds of the cocaine coming from Latin America to Europe passes through West Africa. In terms of domestic drug cultivation, Nigeria and Ghana remain the largest producers of cannabis in West Africa. Cultivation is done largely in partnership with local farmers who plant crops such as okra and tomatoes along with the marijuana plants to reduce the risk of seizure of the plants or government destruction of their farms. Cannabis is also cultivated in remote areas or under cover of forestry to conceal the plants from authorities. Growing fears about the expanding supply of illicit drugs in West Africa has created a focus on control of this growing supply as the preceding goal over other issues such as drug use within the West African region and public health issues. Supply-centered drug control policies have negatively impacted different groups in West Africa that have experienced higher rates of demand for illicit substances with little to no government interference.  Transport  The World Drug Report stated, ‚ÄúThe cocaine found in Africa originated mainly in Colombia and Peru and frequently transited through Brazil‚Äù. Heroin often travels through Southeast Asian regions such as Thailand and through Western Asian countries through a mix of overland routes and air transport by way of couriers. These substances are then transferred from West Africa to North America, Europe, and South Africa by employing direct transit routes and criminal network routes aided by the West African diaspora. In some cases, traffickers even used innocuous international travelers as couriers by having them place unmarked bags in their luggage in exchange for payment. Container ships and private yachts were originally used for transporting cocaine from Latin America to West Africa, but since overseas police began guarding the ocean more stringently, cartels started using second-hand cargo aircraft to deliver cocaine to West Africa.The Transatlantic Cocaine Market Airplanes can be easily obtained and pilots willing to fly those planes are just as easy to hire. Due to West Africa's unreliable national radar networks and coverage, narco-flights are able to fly into West Africa without detection. Illegal drugs were smuggled into Europe from Guinea-Bissau using air freights and commercial airliners that used ‚Äúmules‚Äù, or human vessels, that would swallow condoms full of cocaine in order to bypass airline security. Drugs are smuggled across West African countries using a variety of techniques. When traveling on overland routes, traders hide substances with other products such as charcoal, cocoa, and fruit to conceal the smell and appearance at different police checkpoints. Products are also moved by way of taxis and individual vehicles during times which government posts and trade routes are unregulated and the chance of detection is significantly lower. Lastly, drug traffickers will also pay law enforcement and border officials to move substances through land and sea routes freely and without punishment.  International Consequences  The US's enhanced border security along with the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù in the 1970s and 1980s negatively impacted the Mexican drug cartel Los Zetas. This caused the Mexican drug cartel to branch out and seize control of a profitable smuggling route that goes through West Africa and ends up in Europe. The Mexican cartel's push into Europe is causing Colombian cartels to lose power in Europe. Colombia has been Europe's main source for cocaine, but since the capture and arrest of the cartels leading figure in their supply routes, El Loco (Daniel Barrera Barrera), Colombian cartels have suffered great financial loss. Criminal networks from West Africa have, in turn, spread to other regions‚Äînamely South Africa. Certain individuals central to the drug trade in West Africa carried practices and organizations to the south of the continent where transit costs and risk of detection are relatively lower and new markets exist for harder drugs. Brazil and Venezuela have become major embarkation zones for illegal drugs that are headed for West Africa. Between 2005 and 2008 there were 46 metric tonnes of cocaine seized by police. This coincides with the Venezuelan government ceased work with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The lack of law enforcement in Venezuela along with inadequate border control in both countries and insufficient coastline control in Brazil allows the drug trade to thrive in the two countries and neighboring countries. Brazil and Venezuela are capable of shipping cocaine transnationally to West and South Africa due to the lack of security in both continents.  Drug Control  The growing presence of both trafficking organizations operating on an international level and smaller-scale drug trafficking business operations in many West African countries have cemented localized markets for a range of drugs. The local trade of imported cocaine and heroin has skyrocketed in recent years and, in some countries, has spread drug abuse to virtually every city. Within the last century, marijuana (primarily cultivated in its hashish form) has transitioned from a profitless drug to one that is sold locally and trafficked on the routes previously used for cocaine and heroin. In the past, international organizations and governmental and nongovernmental groups established control measures against drug trafficking through a targeted lens. The main supply countries in the West African drug trade have historically put pressure on West African governments to institute punitive policies and practice harsher methods to control international routes. Related research has similarly focused on the number of arrests made or the amounts of drugs seized rather than the more nuanced connections between drug trafficking and economic and political activity. This focus on arrests and seizures has been shown to have little effect on the size of the West African drug trade and has caused traffickers to simply employ new methods of subversion and concealment. This control methodology has, however, served to target small-scale cannabis growers and substance users rather than larger traffickers that have the money and influence to avoid punishment. The realized results of these enforcement policies have been stricter control at airports, seaports, and other borders in West African nations. International funding has been dispersed and relinquished in connection with the drug networks within countries in an attempt to crack down on corruption and government connections to drug traffickers. In countries like Nigeria, the death penalty was instituted as a way to severely punish those involved in the drug trade at any level and discourage any participation in the drug trade. In Nigeria, this prioritization of strict drug control, exacerbated by patronage relationships between the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and country leadership, has engendered a brutal and repressive internal drug war. These measures do not encompass the full effect of drug trafficking on West Africa, and ignore how trafficking has created a culture of drug consumption among certain communities and city centers.  Corruption and the Drug Trade  A driving factor in rapid growth of the drug trafficking network in West Africa has been deeply rooted corruption in many, if not all, West African countries. Many governmental organizations and politicians benefit from money embezzled through the drug trade and have little incentive to punish large-scale drug traffickers and criminal networks. At a more local level, drug traffickers pay border agents and law enforcement to pass substances through overland networks safely and at low risk. These negotiations and payments are done at little cost to trafficking groups as result of poverty and government debt that allows them to make cheaply compensate corrupt government officials. Civil wars, military coups, and other intergovernmental conflicts exacerbate corruption related to drug trafficking. Political actors in these unstable regimes exercise control of secondary, illegal markets to gain a tighter hold on power. In Guinea Bissau, military leaders that seized power under the pretense of reducing corruption have taken part in corrupt deals that facilitate the flow of drugs across the country's borders. Facing mounting pressure from international institutions, some West African governments have created anti-corruption organizations to start reversing the trend of drug trafficking in their countries. Nigeria created both the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission to identify government officials tied to bribery and embezzlement in underground drug networks. These attempts at reducing corruption in Nigeria as well as other West African countries have largely been met with failure due to weak criminal justice systems and levels of corruption imbued in every level of government.  Drug Policy Reform  In the scope of seeking new measures of control of the drug trade and reform of counter-drug measures, the African Union and West African Commission on Drugs have introduced policy measures that focus on shifting the focus of change from controlling the exports and trafficking of illicit drugs to combatting drug use in West Africa and reducing the internal consumption of drugs that have become more readily available as a result of the drug trade. Several European countries and drug enforcement agencies have aimed to reduce the harm caused to users both in Africa and internationally. This shows a shift from older policies focused on completely eliminating the trade and consumption of illicit substances rather than trying to remedy their effects. These changes have been realized through policy statements and initiatives that seek to strengthen research on the drug trade in West Africa by improving data collection techniques and exploring other control methods outside of the current focus and other illicit drugs besides just cocaine and heroin. In response to the growing consumption within West Africa, the African Union and West African Commission on Drugs have also called for research on how best to treat drug addicts and substance abusers. From a reform standpoint, the objective of the organizations has been to recognize the violent and extrajudicial methods that have been used to control the drug trade in the past and shift policy initiatives to instead facilitate control through researched and debated strategies.  Locations in West Africa   Nigeria  * Local police and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have noticed that the import, export, and traffic of many drugs including heroin, cannabis, and cocaine have been rising. The drugs originate from areas as far as Latin America and Afghanistan. *The decline and subsequent break down of the oil industry as well as new tariffs and restrictions on exported natural resources in the 1980s incentivized many Nigerians to turn to the less restricted drug trade. Over time, this has led to a global presence of Nigerian criminal networks centered around the drug trade and the creation of Nigerian DTOs, or Drug Trade Organizations. *Nigerian drug trafficking organizations are administered top down by drug barons who manage a mix of operators, or \\"strikers\\", who work as intermediaries in building foreign relationships, administering drug sales, and faking legal documentation. These strikers also recruit couriers, ensuring that they have little to no connection to the drug barons they work under. *The reach of the international drug trade has had localized effects in Nigeria as well. As early as 1989, there were accounts of drug addiction centers in Nigeria that had a notably higher number of cases involving heroin or cocaine addiction. This trend is backed by anecdotal evidence of surges in adulterated cocaine and heroin in cities and urban centers throughout Nigeria and other West African Countries. *Since the 1990s, Nigeria's drug control efforts have been identified as some of the most effective in the West African region, despite research that has shown mixed degrees of control. Nigerian drug agencies, led by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, have taken a larger role in working with other African countries in drug enforcement and playing a larger regional role. These Nigerian agencies are also known for their particularly punitive strategies in dealing with drug trafficking with past extrajudicial executions of drug lords and attempts at completely eradicating cannabis. However, in the last ten years, government and domestic funding has decreased for the agencies that employ such strategies, implying a shift in methodology and an attempt at reform in Nigerian drug policy. *The reputation of Nigeria as the source of international drug syndicates has incited gang violence and international violence against Nigerians who are mistakenly labeled as a part of Nigerian criminal networks. Detainment and death of alleged Nigerian drug dealers across the continent has led to health and human rights concerns.  Guinea-Bissau  * Since Guinea-Bissau used to be a Portuguese colony, the Portuguese do not require Bissau-Guineans visas in order to enter Portugal. This allows illegal drugs to be smuggled easily into Europe using ‚Äúmules‚Äù, or human drug vessels. * Guinea-Bissau's poverty makes illegal drug trading ideal in the country because the drug trade can earn the country an estimated $2 billion a year, which is nearly two times as much as Guinea-Bissau's GDP. In European cities the value of the cocaine and drugs could be as high as an estimated $20 billion. * Guinea-Bissau's illegal international drug trade has led to an increase in criminal activity which has led to higher violence in the country.  Ghana  * Ghana was first exposed to cannabis through Ghanaian soldiers who came in contact with the substance in South Asia during World War II. Cultivation and consumption consequently spread quickly through larger cities such as Accra. Ghana is now the second largest West African producer of cannabis. *Nigerian organizations and routes spread to Ghana in the early 1980s and quickly expanded as Nigerian drug traffickers began to be convicted and punished for drug trafficking and Ghana became a safer, alternative network. Many Ghanaians began as drug intermediaries or couriers in the region and quickly moved up to higher positions in criminal syndicates. * Field research in Ghana has shown that the cannabis trade operates in way where product distributions are sold and transported in wholesale. Marijuana is bought from farmers of other crops and fruits and taken to other areas of Ghana and on to other countries like Gambia and Senegal. *The Narcotics Control Board is the primary domestic drug enforcement agency and works to ensure detection of substances, drug searches and seizures, and sufficient cooperation with international organizations to make larger-scale seizures and arrests. The NCB has international approval for its drug enforcement policies, but many local Ghanaian police officers have a less reliable record and are known to take part in drug smuggling and consumption as one of the largest user groups.

In the Western world, masks have been used in dances to portray certain characters, disguise identity, and to depersonalize the dancer. The types of masks and their usage in dance have evolved in time, and are still employed in modern choreographic works.  History   Ancient Greece and Rome  The use of masks in dance in the West traces back to ancient Greece. Grecian dancers would use masks for religious rituals to embody Dionysus and Appollo. In Greek theaters, masks are used to enhance the drama of tragedy and comedy, illustrated by kordax, a mask dance of comedy characterized of uninhibited lasciviousness. Romans used mask in sensual performances where dancers wore briefs and sheer clothing, as a means to cover the identity of the dancers.  Middle Ages and Early Christianity  In the Middle Ages, masks were mostly used to portray a certain character. In ballroom dances, masks were used to create distance for performers dancing entr√©es from others in crowded ballrooms. They used mask to create a uniformity in characters in the chorus, such as Shepherds, Sailors, Nymphs, and Priests. Morris dance, a religious folk dance stemmed from early Christianity that portrays the dueling between Christians and the Moors, North African Muslims who tried to conquer Europe. Masks or blackened faces are used in the pantomimes and fencing scenes to represent the Moors, and bizarre costumes were used to mock them as foolish enemies. In Slavic and Romanian Morris dance, it is less a dance about combat and more about religious folklores and rituals. In the fold dance The Roumanian Hobby-Horse, the C«élu≈üari, the comic figure the dumb man, is masked and dressed in comical costumes. The mask is made to look like a stork's head with a movable beak, contributing to the character's nickname ‚Äúbeak‚Äù.  Renaissance Period  During the Renaissance, masks were used both for disguise and character portrayal. Masque, a precursor to masquerades, is a festival where guests wear masks to disguise themselves, and offer gifts to their hosts, after which they dance in celebration. Masque then evolved into a dance form performed on stage, within a play. Masks are used to portray mythical characters or characters of color, as documented in The Masque of Blackness. In sixteenth century, when dance was still dominated by men, travesty came into place, where men wore masks and dresses to act as women in dance. During late seventeenth century, Louis XIV brought the ballet de cour into one of the most highly regarded noble practices and entertainment. Noble characters wore light colored masks with ideal, symmetrical features with subtle, neutrual expressions. Grotesque dancers, who performed as comic characters, also wore masks with exaggerated features and expressions to add to the comedic qualities of the characters.  Modern and Contemporary Works  Masks in modern and contemporary dance are not used for disguise or for symbolizing a certain character, but to erase the sense of identity and create a sense of depersonalization and remoteness. In Mary Wigman‚Äôs Witch Dance, she wore a white mask with a large cloak, only leaving her hands and feet uncovered. With her eerie choreography, the mask and the cloak add to the effect of her not being completely human, but something odd and out of the common realm. In The Green Table by Kurt Jooss, a ballet exploring the idea of death, Jooss used mask to free dancers of identity. The masks make the dancers look otherworldly, but erases class and individuality at the same time, helping to convey the idea that death does not differentiate or pick his victms.

It conducts propaganda operations and espionage and manages front organizations, including the powerful Chongryon. History The United Front Department (UFD) is one of the most longstanding and important departments of the party. It was initially known as the Culture Department (munhwabu). It was one of many organizations tasked with targeting South Korea at the time. In 1977 its operations were revived and it got its current name. During the rule of Kim Jong-il, the department had its ups and downs. UFD is known to have meddled in the 1997 South Korean presidential election and tried to prevent the election of Kim Dae-jung. It was the subject of major purges 2006, 2007, and 2008. There were apparently issues with corruption and lack of oversight. Organization Administratively, UFD is under the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). UFD is in change of espionage, diplomacy, and policy-making concerning South Korea. It is the primary organization of all state and party organizations that are tasked with relations with South Korea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, does not address relations with the South. Of the other organizations dealing with South Korea, the UFD differs in conducting its activities in the open. It also controls North Korea's religious organizations, including the Korean Christian Federation. UFD is part of a shadowy group of Central Committee organizations known as the \\"Third Building\\". Not much is known about these organizations because South Korean intelligence services have been reluctant to release information out of security concerns. Out of the \\"Third Building\\" organizations, UFD is specifically tasked with maintaining ties with front organizations in both North and South Korea and with overseas Koreans. One of the most powerful of these, the Chongryon representing pro-Pyongyang Zainichi Koreans in Japan, is controlled by the UFD. Other front organizations controlled by the UFD include the Korean Association of Social Scientists, Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, National Reconciliation Council, and the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. North Korea typically deals with front organizations instead of the South Korean government which lacks legitimacy in its eyes. UFD also sends spies to Japan. Accordingly, it is sometimes classified as an intelligence agency. UFD is based in a complex in Junseung-dong in the Moranbong District of Pyongyang. It shares the complex with the Social Culture Department and Operations Department. It has about 3,000 employees. Certain members are among the most influential people in North Korea. The current director is Kim Yong-chol. UFD handles affairs of the Kaesong Industrial Region. It tends to view the region as a manageable risk with a high profit, which is not universally agreed upon in the North Korean administration. UFD is also normally tasked with the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region. When relations with South Korea take a turn for the worse, other organizations are known to take UFD's responsibilities. For instance, in 2008 the National Defence Commission took over relations with the South. Propaganda UFD controls broadcasts that target South Korea. Its methods include psychological warfare through the radio and TV, loudspeakers, leaflets, visual displays, and websites. According to reports, \\"The United Front Department wages its cyber psychological warfare through some 140 sites with servers based in 19 countries. In 2011, North Korean agents posted 27,090 items of propaganda materials against the South, and in 2012 some 41,373\\". It also maintains a team of internet trolls with the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The radio station targeting South Korea, , is directly controlled by the UFD instead of the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee that normally manages external broadcasting. UFD often releases statements that are considered to be authoritative comments of the regime. It also fabricates praise of the Kim family that it attributes to foreigners and then disseminates in North Korean media. Jang Jin-sung, a North Korean defector, worked for the UFD before escaping the country. He has chronicled his work at the department in his book Dear Leader: My Escape from North Korea (2014).

Many educated Jews were inmates of Theresienstadt. In a propaganda effort designed to fool the western allies, the Nazis publicised the camp for its rich cultural life. In reality, according to a Holocaust survivor, \\"during the early period there were no [musical] instruments whatsoever, and the cultural life came to develop itself only ... when the whole management of Theresienstadt was steered into an organized course.\\" The community in Theresienstadt tried to ensure that all the children who passed through the camp continued with their education. The Nazis required all camp children over a certain age to work, but accepted working on stage as employment. The prisoners achieved the children's education under the guise of work or cultural activity. Daily classes and sports activities were held. The community published a magazine, Vedem. The history of the magazine was studied and narrated by the Italian writer Matteo Corradini in his book La repubblica delle farfalle (The Republic of the Butterflies). Sir Ben Kingsley read that novel, speaking on 27 January 2015 during the ceremony held at Theresienstadt to mark International Holocaust Memorial Day. Ilse Weber, a noted Czech Jewish poet, writer and musician for children, was held in the camp from February 1942, and worked as a night nurse in the camp's children's infirmary. She volunteered to join a transport of children to Auschwitz in November 1944, where she, her son Tommy, and all the children with her were murdered in the gas chambers immediately on arrival. Conductor Rafael Sch√§chter was among those held at the camp, and he formed an adult chorus. He directed it in a performance of the massive and complex Requiem by Giuseppe Verdi. Sch√§chter conducted 15 more performances of the work before he was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Violinist Julius Stwertka, a former leading member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and co-leader of the Vienna Philharmonic, died in the camp on 17 December 1942. Pianist Alice Herz- Sommer (held with her son, Raphael Sommer) performed 100 concerts while imprisoned at Theresienstadt. She and Edith Steiner-Kraus, her friend and colleague, both survived the camp, emigrated to Israel after the war, and became professors of music, Herz-Sommer at the Jerusalem Academy of Music, and Steiner-Kraus at the Tel Aviv Academy of Music. Martin Roman and Coco Schumann were part of the jazz band Ghetto Swingers. Artist and art teacher Friedl Dicker-Brandeis created drawing classes for children in the ghetto, among whom were Hana Brady (\\"Hana's suitcase\\"). They produced more than 4,000 drawings, which she hid in two suitcases before she was deported to Auschwitz in the final liquidation. The collection was preserved from destruction, and was discovered a decade later. Most of these drawings can now be seen at the Jewish Museum in Prague, whose archive of the Holocaust section administers the Terez√≠n Archive Collection. Others are on display at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. The children of the camp also wrote stories and poems. Some were preserved and later published in a collection called I Never Saw Another Butterfly, its title taken from a poem by young Jewish Czech poet Pavel Friedmann. He had arrived at Terez√≠n on 26 April 1942 and was later murdered at Auschwitz. Painter Malva Schalek (Malvina Schalkova) was deported to Theresienstadt in February 1942. She produced more than 100 drawings and watercolours portraying life in the camp. On 18 May 1944, due to her refusal to paint the portrait of a collaborationist doctor, she was deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered. Artist and architect Norbert Troller produced drawings and watercolours of life inside Theresienstadt, to be smuggled to the outside world. When the Gestapo found out, he was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where he was liberated by the Russians in 1945. His memoirs and two dozen of his artworks were published in 1991. Composer Viktor Ullmann was interned in September 1942, and died at Auschwitz in October 1944. He composed some twenty works at Theresienstadt, including the one-act opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis (The Emperor of Atlantis or The Refusal of Death). It was planned for performance at the camp, but the Nazis withdrew permission when it was in rehearsal, probably because the authorities perceived its allegorical intent. The opera was first performed in 1975, and shown in full on BBC television in Britain. It continues to be performed. Music composed by inmates is featured in Terez√≠n: The Music 1941‚Äì44, a two-CD set released in 1991. The collection features music composed mostly in 1943 and 1944 by Pavel Haas, Gideon Klein, Hans Kr√°sa, and Viktor Ullmann while interned at Theresienstadt. Haas, Kr√°sa, and Ullmann died in Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, and Klein died in F√ºrstengrube in 1945. In 2007, the album Terez√≠n ‚Äì Theresienstadt of music composed at Theresienstadt was released by the Swedish singer Anne Sofie von Otter, assisted by baritone Christian Gerhaher, pianists, and chamber musicians. In 2008, Bridge Records released a recital by Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair and American pianist Russell Ryan that drew on a different selection of songs.  Culture as Survival  Scholars have interpreted acts of cultural expression through theater, music, and art in Theresienstadt as a strategy for survival by those deported there. The ghetto became the site of a wide variety of works of art using different artistic mediums, from lectures to drawings, and devoted to a variety of themes. At first, cultural activities were suppressed by the Nazis, but when the function of the ghetto as a model became clearer in 1942, these activities were deemed acceptable. The Nazis decided that Theresienstadt could function uniquely as a place to deport member of Europe‚Äôs cultural elite. At this time the Freizeitgestaltung (Association of Free Time Activities) was established, and cultural activities were allowed by the Nazis. However, instruments had previously been smuggled into Theresienstadt since 1941, and many artists considered them to be among their most basic needs. Children in the ghetto expressed themselves and their reactions to their circumstances through drawings in the lessons permitted by the Nazis. With these outlets, the people attempted to create a sense of hope within the ghetto. In Theresienstadt, cultural production thrived much more than in the Protectorate. Art in the ghetto underwent drastic development as it allowed for depiction and representation of true life in Theresienstadt. The artwork provided the people with an artistic outlet through which they could express their feelings of defiance. Despite constant deportations of inmates to the East, the ghetto inhabitants remained determined to continue performing and creating. Places in casts often needed to be reassigned as participants were deported. The people remained strong willed in their persistence to create, as it helped them remain hopeful and live a more humane existence. Rafael Schachter was one of the pioneering members of cultural activity in Theresienstadt. In the early days of Theresienstadt‚Äôs cultural activity, Schachter included a satirical sketch in his first performance. Later in his time in Theresienstadt, Schachter put together a rendition of Verdi‚Äôs Requiem. In this version of Requiem, Schachter changed the ending notes to communicate a resistance signal. Adolf Eichmann and other important Nazi leaders were in the audience for a performance of Schachter‚Äôs Requiem, and Eichmann specifically enjoyed this version of the piece. The Nazi‚Äôs didn't understand the underlying meanings of the change to Requiem or many other works performed in the ghetto. On September 23, 1943, the first performance of the children‚Äôs show Brundibar appeared in Theresienstadt. The show was performed fifty five times, and was the most successful show of all of the productions ever performed in the ghetto. Cast members were replaced as they were deported, but the show's main acts remained the same throughout the duration of the performances. Brundibar‚Äôs original composer Hans Krasa composed a new score for the show in Theresienstadt as the original score had been lost, and the show was put together by Rudolf Freudenfeld under the supervision and tutelage of Rafael Schachter. For the Theresienstadt performances of the show, poet Emil A. Saudek changed the ending lines from the original version to emphasize a political meaning behind the show. It was clear to the audience that the show‚Äôs main antagonist represented Hitler, but the Nazi‚Äôs themselves did not realize the hidden meaning in Brundibar, and even had the show presented during a visit by the Red Cross. Brudibar was the top musical performance ever performed at Theresienstadt. Emperor of Atlantis was another opera produced in Theresienstadt. The opera was created by Peter Kien and Viktor Ullmann, who created the opera in the form of a legend so that they could include hidden meaning that would be missed by the Nazi‚Äôs. Ullman strategically used music to include undertones with resistance implications, including artistic manipulation of Deutchland Uber Alles, and a secondary version of sheet music, with less direct implications than the version that was actually rehearsed, was handed over to the Nazi. Ultimately, Emperor of Atlantis was never performed at Theresienstadt, although scholars differ on their reasoning as to why the opera never reached performance. The show may have ended before being performed because the Nazi‚Äôs in control of the ghetto saw the allegorical connection to Hitler and Nazi Germany in the opera‚Äôs plot line. Alternatively, some scholars say the show never reached performance because of deportation to Auschwitz. Scholar‚Äôs views vary on Nazi reaction to the production of Theresienstadt‚Äôs cultural works. Some say the Nazis remained indifferent to the work that was composed and sung inside the ghetto. Others say that the Nazis encouraged the artistic production, as the SS thought that nothing from Theresienstadt would ever reach outside of the ghetto.

He was sentenced under Article 29 of the United Arab Emirates cyber crime law, by posting comments on the social network Facebook expressing support to armed groups in Gaza and criticising the UAE's support of Egypt's decision to destroy Hamas tunnels in the 2014 Israeli aggression on Gaza. Tayseer was due to be released on 13 December 2018, and was facing a fine of AED 500,000, equivalent to US$136,000. Tayseer's sentence was extended six more months because he was unable to pay the fine. On 12 February 2019, Najjar was released from prison and returned to his home country, Jordan. His fine was pardoned.  Background  According to Human Rights Watch, Najjar was convicted on the basis of his Facebook posts written before he moved to the UAE and criticism on phone calls with his wife. Reportedly, his critical conversations with his wife over the telephone were cited by the trial judgment without disclosing how the UAE authorities obtained records of the calls. Human Rights Watch stated that Najjar's rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the UAE authorities by not allowing him to access a lawyer including during interrogations, for more than a year. Najjar wrote on Facebook: Najjar was questioned about expressing his support for armed groups.

Career Numerous articles in specialist encyclopaedias such as the RGG (4th edition) and anthologies point to Auffarth as a distinguished scholar (see below). The encyclopaedia Metzler Encyclopedia Religion: Everyday Life, Media, Present is one of the standard works in the field of religious studies. The International Review for Biblical Studies characterized the lexicon: \\"The volume is characterized by the cultural- historical orientation of the T√ºbingen School of Religious Studies and the publisher Auffarth and thus represents an addition to the handbook of fundamental religious concepts. The entire work deserves emphatic recommendation.\\" The Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung wrote: \\"The use of this lexicon itself is already not only an intellectual, but also sensual pleasure.\\" In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the reviewer Wolfram Kinzig praised Auffarth's book The heretics: Cathars , Waldenses and other religious movements and described the author as a \\"connoisseur of the topic in the Middle Ages\\".

She was the mother of Taksin, the founder of Thonburi kingdom. She was of Mon-Thai descent.  Ancestry  Fran√ßois Turpin stated that she was Chinese;‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏®‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏ö ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå, ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤ 104 if so, Taksin was a full-blooded Chinese.Are we them? The Chinese in 20th-century Thai literature and history, pp. 189 Kulap Tritsananon, a Thai journalist, also stated that her family name was Ngo (, ). However, official records of Thailand stated that she was a Thai noble woman, and married a Chinese merchant named Yong Saetae.ÂõõÂçÅ‰∫åÊ¢ÖÂ±ÖÂ£´, ÈÑ≠Êò≠ÂÇ≥ Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix, also stated that she was a Thai. Moreover, the recent studies show that Nok-iang's mother was a younger sister to Mon nobles; Phraya Phetburi (personal name: Roeang) and Phraya Ram Chaturong (personal name: Chuan). Roeang was appointed by the King Borommakot in 1757 as governor of Phetburi, then the Mon population center and naval base. Phraya Ram Chaturong (Chuan) served as chief of Siam's Mon community during the reign of King Ekkathat before the fall of Ayutthaya. Phraya Ram Chaturong (Chuan) was killed in action by Burmese forces in the fall of Ayutthaya while Phraya Phetburi (Roeang) fall in the course of King Taksin's southern campaign of 1769. Nok-iang's mother married a Thai man. Furthermore, Nok-iang's cousin, Phraya Nakhone In (personal name: Ma Khon), served as commander of Krom Dap Song Moe, one of Siam's several Mon military regiments too. Another cousin called Thong-Mon who was a daughter of Phraya Ram Chaturong (Chuan) later assigned as Thaw Songkadan (guardian of the royal treasury) by King Taksin in Taksin's Thonburi Grand Palace. Those facts prove that Nok-iang was a Mon-Thai descent, not a Chinese as previously assumed. And, this is also consistent with Taksin's childhood friendship with Thongduang (later Rama I) who was a descendant of Ayutthaya's Mon aristocratic family, and Taksin's association with his royalist Mon generals; Phraya Ramanwong and Phraya Phichai, and Taksin's most welcoming gesture on Mon settlement in his Thonburi capital.  Birth of Taksin  She gave birth to Taksin the Great on 17 April 1734. Later, probably due to Phithak Thephamat's lineage with Mon noble family, Taksin was supposedly raised as nobility. In 1769, she was awarded the feudal title of Somdet Krom Phra Phithak Thephamat by King Taksin.‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏®‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏ö ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå, ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤ 105 She died in 1774.

This movement was initiated by Jain monk Aacharya Yugbhushan Surishwarji against recent infrastructure development initiated by the existing Government's actions, which Jains believe, has severely affected the sanctity of the Shikharji Hill. This Movement is unitedly led by Jains of all sects (Shwetamber, Digamber, Sthanak and Terapanthi). Through this movement, the Jains want the Shikharji Hill declared as a 'Place Of Worship', by the concerned authorities of the Govt. Shikharji Tirth is regarded as the most sacred place of worship for the Jains. Jain community members have opposed the plans of the state government to improve the infrastructure in the hill to boost tourism as alleged attempts to commercialize the Shikharji hill.  History of Shikharji Tirth  Farman issued by Emperor Akbar which considered Shikharji as a Place of Pilgrimage The modern history records show that Shikharji Hill is regarded as the place of worship of the Jain community. During the regime of Mughal's rule in India, Emperor Akbar in the year 1583 had voluntarily passed an official order (farman) granting the management of Shikharji Hill to the Jain community to prevent the slaughter of animals in the vicinity.  Bihar Land Reform Act Impact  This Act came into force on 25/09/1950 by Bihar Government of India. As per this Act, all the proprietors, mortgagees, lessees and tenure-holders in land, including interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, ferries, hats, bazaars, mines and minerals have to be transferred it to the State Government With the help of this act, the state government of Bihar on 02/05/1953 issued a notification under Section 3(1) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act that the entire Shikharji Hill will hence forth be rendered as state's property. Jains believe as a fall out of this newly enforced act, activities like Tree Plantation, Pig farming, Cultivations, Building of Sanatorium, Helipad, tourist resorts etc. could find a way to flourish on the Holy Hill. Despite a clear mention of the following point in chapter I, section 4 (f) of the Bihar land reforms act- ‚Äú ‚Ä¶.nothing contained in this clause ‚Ä¶.authorize the Collector to take charge of any institution, religious or secular‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù  Recent Government Activities On The Hill  The Govt. has carried out various activities listed below. * With Tourism flourishing in India, Govt. wants Shikharji to be developed as a Tourist destination. * Government declared that Marang Buru temple is to be constructed on this particular Hill and not on any other place. * Construction of helipad on the hill. * Construction of Tree House and Cottages. There are inhibitions of the Jain community that developing the hill into a tourist place will attract a lot of other social and cultural evils. Hotels, motels, non veg food, hunting, gambling, prostitution, adultery etc. may become rampant in times to come. On 22 September 2015, the Government released a press note stating that it shall focus on developing the hill as an International spiritual centre for peace and enlightenment. This press release of Government was prompted because a delegation of the Jains‚Äô had gone to protest against the prospective idea of the Government to build a Helipad. When the delegation pointed out their concerns for such a step, Government retracted and agreed in principle to withdraw its development plans and instead decided to glorify the sacredness of the hill. On December 27 the CM reiterated the above actions which will be taken by this government. However, Government chose to construct the helipad and built barracks for military.  Protest by Jains  All the sects of the Jains‚Äô consider this Hill as the most sacred place. Protests across the country from the people of Jain community have taken place in the form of on/off line petitions addressed to the PM and the CM of Jharkhand state. Protest rallies, congregations and protests on social media have been taken up by the community.  Government‚Äôs Response  On 10 October 2018, government orally assured that it will not construct any other structure on the hill which will affect sanctity of Jains. However, Jains are still demanding a written statement from the concerned authorities declaring Shikharji as a place of worship, as they believe they have been betrayed by giving oral assurances earlier by the government.

Following the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Lynette, and two separate coronial inquests, the NSW Coroner determined that Lynette Dawson was dead and that her most likely murderer was her husband, Chris. After many years of stalled and failed investigations, Chris Dawson was arrested and charged with murder in December 2018. , Dawson is on bail pending trial. Early life  Dawson was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the second born of twins; his twin brother is Paul Dawson. Chris Dawson attended Sydney Boys High School where he was a prefect. He graduated in 1966. Chris Dawson met Lynette Simms at a high school function in 1965, when they were both aged sixteen. They married in 1970 at St Jude's Church, Randwick, and later had two children. Football career  Both Chris and Paul played rugby union for Eastern Suburbs. The Dawson brothers switched codes to play rugby league for the Newtown Jets in 1972. Chris Dawson played in the second row along with Paul for the Newtown Jets club for five seasons. The Dawson brothers were part of the 1973 New South Wales Rugby League Club Championship winning team.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995. ()  Subsequent career  After their rugby careers finished, both Chris and Paul Dawson became physical education teachers at public high schools on the north shore and northern beaches of Sydney. Dawson was teaching at Cromer High School in 1981 when he commenced a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil, Joanne Curtis, while he was married to Lynette Dawson. The Dawson brothers and families moved to Queensland in 1985. Chris Dawson worked at Keebra Park State High School first then later moved to Coombabah State High School to work with his brother Paul. In 2003 Dawson was working at St Ursula's College in Yeppoon, Queensland.  Wife's disappearance Lynette Dawson went missing in January 1982. Three days after Lynette's disappearance, Chris Dawson invited Curtis to moved into the family house. He reported his wife missing on 18 February 1982, six weeks after her disappearance, claiming she had left after marital problems and had joined a commune. He finalised divorce proceedings against Lynette in 1983. Chris Dawson married Joanne Curtis in 1984. The couple divorced in 1993. Lynette Dawson's body has never been found but two coronial inquests were conducted in 2001 and 2003 with both ruling that Lynette Dawson must be dead and was most likely murdered by a known person. On 5 December 2018 Dawson was arrested by detectives from Queensland Police for the murder of Lynette Dawson. He was extradited to New South Wales on 6 December 2018 to face trial. In his appearance at Sydney's Central Local Court that day, he was refused bail and was remanded in custody. On 17 December 2018 Dawson was granted bail and his family paid A$1.5 million bail for him to be released. Appearing in the NSW Local Court in June 2019, Dawson pleaded not guilty to the murder of Lynette Dawson. In February 2020, Dawson was committed to stand trial for the murder of Lynette. His arraignment was set for April, with a potential trial date later in 2020. Chris Dawson was the main subject of an investigative podcast series, The Teacher's Pet, by journalist Hedley Thomas. Thomas investigated allegations about the disappearance of Lynette Dawson and brought Chris Dawson into renewed public and media focus through the podcast's broadcast in 2018. , the Gold Walkley-award winning podcast was downloaded 28 million times.

Overview All songs were newly arranged by keyboardist, programmer and composer Luciano Luisi in a rock/hard rock style, with hints of prog rock and electronica. Described by Luisi on the documentary video Filming Around Tour, on the bonus DVD bundled with the original 2009 release, as \\"a cross between rock, metal, power pop and Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\", the new arrangements were, according to Luisi and Cristiano De Andr√©, a way to distance De Andr√© Junior's live performances from his father's studio and live recordings (which Luisi views as sacred and untouchable), while at the same time bringing them closer to Cristiano's own sensitivity.Filming Around Tour documentary film All songs feature a prominent electric guitar, heavily distorted and often processed, played by Osvaldo Di Dio, as well as Luisi's vintage-sounding keyboards and synths. The only exceptions are a 3-song, fully acoustic medley on the second volume, and \\"La canzone dell'amore perduto\\", at the end of the same volume, performed by De Andr√© Jr. on piano, backed by a soft guitar accompaniment by Di Dio and a double bass part by Davide Pezzin. PFM's influential 1979 arrangements (originally released on Fabrizio De Andr√© in Concerto - Arrangiamenti PFM) for \\"Amico fragile\\", \\"La canzone di Marinella\\" and \\"Il pescatore\\" were reproduced almost verbatim, although Di Dio's guitar is still more prominent in the new versions than Franco Mussida's in the 1979 ones. Bonus DVDs Filming Around Tour Filming Around Tour (a deliberately ungrammatical portmanteau of \\"Filming around\\" and \\"Around (the) tour\\", meant as \\"About the tour\\"), is a short (37 minutes) documentary film, by filmmaker Daniele Pignatelli, about the making of the tour. It includes excerpts from behind-the-scenes interviews with Cristiano De Andr√© and the band, as well as full live performances of \\"'√Ç √ßimma\\", \\"Se ti tagliassero a pezzetti\\", \\"Amico fragile\\" and \\"Fiume Sand Creek\\". *At the start of the film, De Andr√© Jr. describes the tour as a \\"passing of the baton\\" from his father to himself, and, at the end, he states that he always felt his father's presence on stage. * Talking about the songs from Cr√™uza de m√§, Le nuvole and Anime salve written in Genoese dialect, Cristiano admits that he had a hard time learning all the words and their correct pronunciations, as he had never sung in Genoese before backing his father on his 1997-1998 Anime salve tour (his final one). He also states that De Andr√© Sr. had a habit of wrongly pronouncing the German surname 'Kreutzer' (mostly referring either to classical musician Rodolphe Kreutzer or to Beethoven's Violin Sonata No. 9, popularly known as \\"Kreutzer Sonata\\" and dedicated to him) in a similar way to the Genoese word cr√™uza, and that the song \\"Cr√™uza de m√§\\", which Cristiano included in the tour setlist, ended up being regularly referred to by all the band members, including himself, as \\"Kreutzer del mar\\", using the correct pronunciation of \\"Kreutzer\\" - i.e. \\"Kr√≤iza\\".Filming Around Tour documentary film *In an interview clip, Cristiano reveals the truth behind some of the nastiest, most cynical lines in \\"Amico fragile\\" [\\"Frail friend\\"], one of Fabrizio De Andr√©'s best-known songs, and about its disconnected, stream-of- consciousness-like structure. The germ of the song was born during a summer evening which the De Andr√© family spent in their rural house in Sardinia with a group of friends; after dinner, everybody got drunk and Fabrizio was forced to sing in spite of him not wanting to. In his intoxicated state, he improvised a bawdy song where he exposed all of his friends' defects and vices. After they had left, he retreated into the same garage where Cristiano is filming the interview, and wrote the whole of \\"Amico fragile\\" right away. The interview clip starts with Cristiano singing the first line of the song while performing its intricate accompaniment on acoustic guitar, displaying his prowess on the instrument; the film then cuts to his full onstage live performance of the same song, after which Cristiano talks about it. Notturno dell'Amistade Notturno dell'Amistade [literally \\"Nocturne of Friendship\\", from Sardinian], recorded live on 3 July 2010 at the medieval Castello Pallavicino in Varano de' Melegari, is a 3-song excerpt from a longer show performed by Cristiano De Andr√© with various guest artists as a benefit concert for Dori Ghezzi's charity organization Fondazione Fabrizio De Andr√©. The show included orchestrated and re-arranged versions of songs by Fabrizio De Andr√©, performed by all the guests. *\\"Disamistade\\" is arranged by trumpeter and composer Markus Stockhausen and performed by the local chamber orchestra Vianiner Philarmoniker with the Cappella Farnesiana choir. It features a new introduction for brass and strings and an expanded orchestration for strings and choir, also including improvised flugelhorn parts by Stockhausen. *\\"Franziska\\" features Spanish female quartet Malasangre (literally \\"Bad Blood\\", formed by sisters Maria, Marta and Pilar Robles with their cousin Pilar Crespo) and a radical flamenco-style re-arrangement by Malasangre themselves. It is played much faster than Fabrizio De Andr√©'s original recording on L'Indiano, features prominent nylon-string guitars and is partly sung in Spanish. During the instrumental interludes between verses, the Robles sisters dance on their own. *\\"Valzer per un amore (Valzer campestre)\\" features a jazz-oriented orchestral arrangement and a trumpet part by Markus Stockhausen, as well as an excerpt from Dmitri Shostakovich's popular \\"Waltz 2\\", taken from his 1956 Suite for Variety Orchestra.

It is a deciduous, terrestrial orchid with two or three egg-shaped leaves and between eight and twenty-two brownish to purplish flowers with their lateral sepals joined at the base. It grows in the understorey of near-coastal forests. Description Liparis habenarina is a terrestrial, deciduous herb with two underground pseudobulbs, each of which lasts for one season. There are usually three, thin, pleated, egg-shaped leaves and wide with five obvious veins. Between eight and twenty two brownish to purplish flowers, long and wide are borne on an upright flowering stem long. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and turns downward. The lateral sepals are long, wide and joined to each other. The petals are a similar length but only about wide and curve downwards. The labellum is egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base and curves downwards. It is long and wide with two ridges near its base, a greenish centre and wavy edges. Flowering occurs between January and May. Taxonomy and naming The common sphinx orchid was first formally described in 1864 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Sturmia habenarina and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The description was based on a specimen collected near Rockingham Bay by John Dallachy. In the description, von Mueller noted Liparis habenarina as a synonym. In 1873, George Bentham changed the name to Liparis habenarina and published the name change in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (habenarina) refers to the similarity of this species to those in the orchid genus Habenaria. Distribution and habitat Liparis habenarina grows with grasses in the understorey of forests, usually near the edge of swamps in near-coastal areas. It is found in New South Wales north from Coffs Harbour, in coastal Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Northern Kimberley biogeographic region of Western Australia. Authorities using the name Empusa habenarina list the range as extending to New Guinea and Indonesia.

There he studied piano with Isidore Philipp and composition with No√´l Gallon and Henri Busser. He won two First Prizes. At 26, he accompanied the cellist Maurice Mar√©chal on a tour of the Middle East. But the war broke out and Herbin was mobilized in 1939. He was taken prisoner in Germany where he remained in captivity for nearly 5 years in several forced labour camps. Interned in very precarious conditions, he nevertheless managed to write many works: a Sonata for violin and piano, De√Ørdre des Douleurs for chamber orchestra, Sonata for piano, Album d'images, Preludes baroques, for piano. Returning to Paris in 1945, he resumed his activities as a pianist and composer, and premiered his first piano quartet in 1949 with the Trio Pasquier.Trio Pasquier on BnF In the early 1950s, the State and Radio placed orders with him. It was on this occasion that he composed Trois Songes pour orchestre (1951) and the Concerto pour piano (1952) whose posthumous premiere was ensured in 1956 by Vlado Perlemuter.

In it, it is usually claimed that the community originated in a land called Misri located in the north. This land is in many accounts identified or associated with Egypt and sometimes an association with one of the lost tribes of Israel is implied and occasionally directly stated. Prevalence Dr Ochieng (1972) noted the legend among the Kisii people who claim that before they migrated to Mt Elgon, they lived in a country called 'Misri' that was located north of Mt Elgon. In the legend, the Kisii traveled south in the company of the Kuria, the Maragoli, Bukusu, and Meru. The Maragoli in turn claim that while they were at Misri, they lived with Arabs, the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Baganda, Basoga as well as the other Luhya subtribes. Dr Ochieng notes that the Misri legend had also been recorded among the other Luhya subtribes as well as the Haya, Alur, Kipsigis and the Marakwet.Ochieng, W.R., 'Misri' Legends in East and Central Africa, East Africa Journal, 1972https://journals.co.za/content/kenya/1/4/AJA02578301_348 online Origins The concept of a 'migration' of a people south into Africa from Egypt originated in the mid-19th century with the development of the Hamitic hypothesis whose origins go further back to the development of the Hamitic race theory. Of particular note in the development of the hypothesis was the examination of thousands of human skulls by Samuel George Morton who argued on this basis that the differences between the races were too broad to have stemmed from a single common ancestor, but were instead consistent with separate racial origins. In his Crania Aegyptiaca (1844), Morton analyzed over a hundred intact crania gathered from the Nile Valley, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were racially akin to Europeans. His conclusions would establish the foundation for the American School of anthropology, and would also influence proponents of polygenism. Hamitic hypothesis The British explorer John Hanning Speke popularized the ancient Hamitic peregrinations in his publications on his search for the source of the Nile River. Speke believed that his explorations uncovered the link between \\"civilized\\" North Africa and \\"primitive\\" central Africa. Describing the Ugandan Kingdom of Buganda, he argued that its \\"barbaric civilization\\" had arisen from a nomadic pastoralist race who had migrated from the north and was related to the Hamitic Oromo (Galla) of Ethiopia.Sanders, Edith R. (October 1969). \\"The Hamitic Hypothesis; Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective\\". The Journal of African History. 10 (4): 521‚Äì532. In his Theory of Conquest of Inferior by Superior Races (1863), Speke would also attempt to outline how the Empire of Kitara in the African Great Lakes region may have been established by a Hamitic founding dynasty. In his influential The Mediterranean Race (1901), the anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi argued that the Mediterranean race had likely originated from a common ancestral stock that evolved in the Sahara region in Africa, and which later spread from there to populate North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the circum-Mediterranean region.Giuseppe Sergi, The Mediterranean Race: A Study of the Origin of European Peoples, (BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008), pp.42-43. According to Sergi, the Hamites themselves constituted a Mediterranean variety, and one situated close to the cradle of the stock.Giuseppe Sergi, The Mediterranean Race: A Study of the Origin of European Peoples, (Forgotten Books), pp.39-44. He added that the Mediterranean race \\"in its external characters is a brown human variety, neither white nor negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or negroid peoples.\\"Giuseppe Sergi, The Mediterranean Race: A Study of the Origin of European Peoples, (BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008), p.250. Maasai, labelled a \\"mixed Nilotic Hamite\\" in Augustus Henry Keane's Man, Past and Present (1899). Writers such as Keane and C.G. Seligman believed that ethnic groups such as the Maasai and the Tutsi, traditionally considered Negro, were of partly Hamitic descent. Seligman used the term \\"Hamiticised Negro\\". He largely based this on their cattle-raising culture and comparatively narrower facial features than those of other neighboring Great Lakes tribes. Sergi explained this taxonomy as inspired by an understanding of \\"the morphology of the skull as revealing those internal physical characters of human stocks which remain constant through long ages and at far remote spots[...] As a zoologist can recognise the character of an animal species or variety belonging to any region of the globe or any period of time, so also should an anthropologist if he follows the same method of investigating the morphological characters of the skull[...] This method has guided me in my investigations into the present problem and has given me unexpected results which were often afterwards confirmed by archaeology or history.\\"Giuseppe Sergi, The Mediterranean Race: A Study of the Origin of European Peoples, (Forgotten Books), p.36. The Hamitic hypothesis reached its apogee in the work of C. G. Seligman, who argued in his book The Races of Africa (1930) that: Seligman asserted that the Negro race was essentially static and agricultural, and that the wandering Hamitic \\"pastoral Caucasians\\" had introduced most of the advanced features found in central African cultures, including metal working, irrigation and complex social structures.Sanders, Edith R. (October 1969). \\"The Hamitic Hypothesis; Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective\\". The Journal of African History. 10 (4): 521‚Äì532. Despite criticism, Seligman kept his thesis unchanged in new editions of his book into the 1960s. Hamiticised Negroes Seligman and other early scholars believed that, in the African Great Lakes and parts of Central Africa, invading Hamites from North Africa and the Horn of Africa had mixed with local Negro women to produce several hybrid \\"Hamiticised Negro\\" populations. The Hamiticised Negroes were divided into three groups according to language and degree of Hamitic influence: the Negro-Hamites (later Nilo- Hamities) or Half-Hamites (such as the Maasai, Nandi and Turkana), the Nilotes (such as the Shilluk and Nuer), and the Bantus (such as the Hima and Tutsi). Seligman would explain this Hamitic influence through both demic diffusion and cultural transmission:Seligman, CG (1930), The Races of Africa, London, p. 96. Historiography Early accounts The Misri legend is evident in the earliest accounts of various East African peoples. Merker's (1904) account on the Maasai, later quoted in Hollis' (1905) work on the Nandi states \\"that the Masai (and presumably with them the Nandi, Turkana &c.;) are the remains of a Semitic race which has wandered southwards from Arabia and been mingled with African elements.\\" In this instance, the origin of some clans in Mt Elgon gives the 'northern origin' theory credence.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. xvii Though lacking direct reference to Misri, Kenyatta (1938) gives an illustrative account of how Christian beliefs came to be localized during the 1920s. The fusion of old traditions and the new belief system resulted in the Watu wa Mungu view that they were the \\"chosen people of God\\", referred to by the old name but seen as the God of the Bible, and thus \\"they proclaim that they belong to the lost tribes of Israel.\\"Kenyatta, J., Facing Mount Kenya, The Tribal Life of the Gikuyu, Mercury Books, p.279 Post-colonial accounts Of the post-colonial accounts on the Misri legend, Dr Ochieng's (1972) was perhaps the most influential. In his analysis he details the prevalence as indicated above but also makes a subtle and notable observation. Of the Ganda, the Soga and the Gwe he states that \\"the traditions of these people do not specifically mention Misri but their migrations from the Elgon population and beyond would lend strong support to their earlier association with travelers from the mythical 'Misri'\\" implying that any community with a tradition of origin pointing to Mt Elgon originates in 'Misri'. It is notable that he terms it the \\"mythical Misri\\" for by the time of his account the word Misri was prevalent in the lexicon of many of these communities. In regard to this he observes \\"The first point to take into account is that Misri as referred to in these traditions, denotes a specific territory to the north of Mount Elgon; it is not simply a direction. If it were a direction it is most unlikely that both the Bantu-speaking groups and the Rift Valley Nilotes would use the same term for it.\\"Ochieng, W.R., 'Misri' Legends in East and Central Africa, East Africa Journal, 1972 In stating this he does not explain how Mt Elgon, a more recent 'stop-over', came to have different names among all these communities. In his analysis of the legend, he does note that some East African historians, notably G. A. Anyona and Gideon Were had flatly rejected the claims as \\"legends smuggled into African traditions, by Christian elders, from the Old Testament. Other historians e.g B.E Kipkorir were somewhat ambivalent about the claims while others such as J.B Osogo and Cardale Luck accepted the traditions and \\"in fact, go to the extent of trying to prove that some of these East African groups, who claim to have come from 'Misri', actually did come from Egypt. In Dr Ochieng's analysis \\"the explanation that these traditions have been influenced by the Bible...is too simple to be swallowed uncritically\\" primarily because of prevalence and as \\"there is no reason why the various African societies who profess these traditions should not have acquired them independently of the Bible\\". He also questions why is \\"'Misri'(Egypt) agreed on as the homelands of these groups?\\" in light of the fact that both the Old and New Testaments mention other places in Africa-for example Cush, Ethiopia and Punt. His conclusion would hark back to Seligman's position as laid out almost forty years earlier, the most significant departure from Seligman's position being that the primary bearers of the tradition were in his account Bantu communities; Contemporary interpretations Generally, the concept of Hamitic languages and the notion of a definable \\"Hamite\\" racial and linguistic entity has been discredited. In 1974, writing about the African Great Lakes region, Christopher Ehret described the Hamitic hypothesis as the view that \\"almost everything more un-'primitive', sophisticated or more elaborate in East Africa [was] brought by culturally and politically dominant Hamites, immigrants from the North into East Africa, who were at least part Caucasoid in physical ancestry\\". He called this a \\"monothematic\\" model, which was \\"romantic, but unlikely\\" and \\"[had] been all but discarded, and rightly so\\". He further argued that there were a \\"multiplicity and variety\\" of contacts and influences passing between various peoples in Africa over time, something that he suggested the \\"one-directional\\" Hamitic model obscured.Ehret, C, Ethiopians and East Africans: The Problem of Contacts, East African Pub. House, 1974, p.8. The localized adaptations in the form of the Misri legend are still very much alive in East Africa however. Dr Kipkoech araap Sambu in his account (2015) of the Kalenjin Peoples Oral Tradition of Ancient Egyptian Origin makes reference to the Misri legend. He notes that \\"generation after generation of the elder's of the Kalenjin- speaking people have passed on to the youth the tradition that their ancestors of antiquity migrated to East Africa from Misri\\". His synthesis of the tradition essentially traces the build-up of the myth among the Kalenjin. He notes that Sang (2000) in his oral fieldwork among the Kipsigis found that \\"...the majority maintain that we came from Misri(Egypt) or Southern Sudan, all these being desert lands\\".

It features Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber and American rapper Young Thug. It was released as the eleventh track in Scott's Rodeo (2015) album.  Background  On September 7, 2018, Scott spoke about the song's lengthy four-year delay, he said on Twitter \\"Maria I‚Äôm drunk can finally be stream. It's been a legit 4 years don't ask me what took so long !!! I‚Äôm just happy I can listen to it.\\" It was made available for online streaming for the first time as it was originally made accessible to only those who paid for the album. The lack of immediate release was described by Complex as a tactic \\"used by many artists who have used album-exclusives to rack in more coin.\\" The song was believed to have been not published for years because labels were trying \\"to suppress Bieber's rap career.\\" Scott and Bieber performed the song in a New York record release party. Scott revealed that the collaboration happened because \\"Bieber had reached out to him\\" and because he had a \\"song in mind\\". Scott stated that \\"As soon as I got to the studio he played it for me...He already had [his rap verse on it] done. That shit was fucking crazy. I went back in and produced over it. That shit's so pure!\\".  Composition  The song begins with swirling synths, backup vocals, and moody atmospherics.\\" In it, Scott calls out for a figure named Maria over a \\"dissonant, piano riff\\" alongside Young Thug who lyrically invites the figure to \\"call your friends and get drunk\\". Bieber opens the second verse by singing \\"in a fast and fierce manner with the intensity of a rap\\" before shifting to a R&B; tempo.

Bartlett, 1929 Emma Kauike≈çlani Napoleon Mahelona Wilcox (November 25, 1851 ‚Äì October 22, 1931), was a socialite, philanthropist and civic leader from Hawaii. She is the namesake of Kauike≈çlani Children's Hospital, and the founder of the Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital. Background She was born of Corsican, Tahitian and Native Hawaiian ancestry in the Mililani area of the island of Oahu, and was raised in a house on Queen Street in Honolulu. She was the first of fifteen children born to Pamahoa and Temanihi ‚ÄúNihi‚Äù Napoleon, a Honolulu fish merchant. Her mother Pamahoa was of Hawaiian ancestry, related to the family of Charles Kana ªina, the father of King Lunalilo. Genealogy provided by Pamahoa Napoleon, daughter of Kupae Emma was educated at Kawaiaha ªo Seminary for Girls, becoming a teacher there after graduation. Early on in her life, Emma was motivated to help ease difficulties faced by the native Hawaiian population. Emma married the first time in 1882 to Samuel Kahekili Mahelona, the son of Judge Samuel Waimalu Mahelona. Educated at the Royal School, he had been an employee of Allen & Robinson on Kauai. Emma and Samuel were the parents of Samuel Hooker Kaleokalani, Ethel Kulamanu, Cushman Nehenuiokalani and Allen Clesson Kualuheimalama. The couple had ties to the monarchy and the political power structure of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Upon her husband's death in 1892, his funeral was attended by Queen Lili ªuokalani and her ladies in waiting, Governor of Oahu Archibald Scott Cleghorn and other kingdom dignitaries. In widowhood, she resumed her teaching career at Kawaiaha ªo. In 1898, she married wealthy Kauai business man and politician Albert Spencer Wilcox, the son of missionaries Abner Wilcox and Lucy Eliza Hart.

Dole, Princess Ka ªiulani, Chief Justice Albert Francis Judd, politician Joseph Ballard Atherton, former Minister of Finance Peter Cushman Jones, the Rev. Charles McEwen Hyde and sugar baron Paul Isenberg. When Albert Wilcox died in 1919, less than $50,000 of his estimated $6 million estate was bequeathed to charitable organizations.

According to the terms of his will, the trustees of the estate were to see that Emma received \\"not less than $30,000 a year\\". Charitable endeavors  Kauike≈çlani Children's Hospital Her husband Albert supported her philanthropic community activities, and in 1908 donated land and $50,000 to erect the Kauike≈çlani Children's Hospital in her honor. The institution was given her Hawaiian name which means ‚Äúplace in the skies (of) heaven‚Äù. In 1928, she donated a therapy swimming pool for the hospital's Shriner's Ward for crippled children. That year, she also donated $10,000, which was used to create a fund for needy patients who could not afford medical care on their own. A portrait of Emma painted by Charles W. Bartlett was donated to the hospital in 1929. Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital Her son Samuel Kaleookalani Mahelona died of tuberculosis at age 28 in 1912. To honor his memory, she founded the Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital on Kauai in 1917. Seed money was provided by Albert Wilcox and other business leaders of Hawaii. Other She was an active member of the Daughters of Hawaii, and a director of the YWCA in Honolulu. The Haili Church in Hilo was the recipient of a pipe organ through her generosity. When Honolulu police officer William Kama was killed in the line of duty in 1928, leaving behind a widow and small children, Emma and Princess Abigail Campbell KawƒÅnanakoa paid off the mortgage on the Kama house.

He began his career during wartime, playing for Derby County, Arsenal and Cardiff City, signing for the latter after the war. He made his professional debut in 1948 for the club but made no further appearances before moving on to Newport County. Career Griffiths was born on a farm in the village of Blaengwynfi, near Maesteg. He began his career as an amateur with Derby County during wartime. He also appeared as a guest player for Cardiff City and Arsenal, including playing in the club's match against Russian side Dynamo Moscow who were touring the UK in 1945. He played the first 45 minutes of the match but was replaced at half time by Colchester United goalkeeper Harry Brown, who had attended the game as a spectator. Griffiths was forced off after sustaining an injury when he was kicked in the head by opposition forward Konstantin Beskov. When Griffiths was unable to continue, a call was issued around the ground for a replacement with Brown arriving in the home dressing room just before Charlton Athletic's Sam Bartram. He signed for Cardiff City at the end of the war and made his professional debut in 1948, playing in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Newcastle United. However, he was unable to break into the first team ahead of Danny Canning and later Phil Joslin and eventually left the side in 1952. He moved to Newport County where he made three league appearances. Later life Following the end of his professional football career Griffiths, who had qualified as a vet in July 1943, was employed at a colliery to treat the site's pit ponies. He went on to open his own veterinary practice in Newport before becoming a fellow at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, becoming one of the first in Wales after publishing a paper on artificial insemination in sheep. He also worked for the Ministry of Agriculture inspecting cattle. He went on to own race horses and became a well-known figure in horse racing, attending over 50 Epsom Derbys. This eventually led to him working for BBC Radio Wales as a racing reporter and tipster. Griffiths developed Alzheimer's in later life. He died in May 2006 at the age of 86 in Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after suffering a fall in his home.

History  The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation was created as part of the 2007 Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, which dictated that a permanent archive would be established to contain the records of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The Centre contains all of the residential school survivor testimony, archival documents, and other materials collected by the TRC from 2009 to 2015. The holdings include millions of church and government records, hundreds of residential school photographs, and over 7,000 survivor statement collected by the TRC. The NCTR opened in the fall of 2015 in Winnipeg, on the campus of the University of Manitoba. The digital archive portion of the NCTR opened to the public on 3 November 2015. In December 2016, the Canadian Federal Government allocated $10 million to the ongoing operations of the NCTR. In September 2019, the NCTR was added to the UNESCO Canada Memory of the World Register.  Organization  The NCTR is intended to be a repository for the complete history and legacy of the residential school system, with the goal of teaching Canadians about this history.  Governance  The NCTR is governed by an administrative agreement between the TRC and the University of Manitoba. The Centre is overseen by a seven-member governing circle, composed of three Survivors, two representatives from the University of Manitoba, and two members from partner organizations. The NCTR is also overseen by a Survivor Circle, which includes First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit survivors of the residential school system from across Canada.  Collections  Under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, religious and government bodies involved in the operations of the residential schools were legally required to submit all relevant residential school records to the TRC, which would then by transferred to the NCTR. In 2018, it came to light that the NCTR was still waiting on over 3,000 photographs and numerous boxes of litigation material to be submitted from the Grey Nuns of Montreal.  Programming  The NCTR is engaged in a range of educational and research programming related to residential schools, healing, and reconciliation. Ongoing programming includes: * \\"Imagine a Canada,\\" a national art and essay program engaging Canadian youth in thinking about what reconciliation can look like. * \\"Lessons from the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement,\\" an initiative seeking input and feedback from survivors on their experiences with the settlement agreement, and to foster discussion about what worked and didn't work with the agreement process. On 30 September 2019, to coincide with Orange Shirt Day, the NCTR released in ceremony a memorial register that documents the 4,037 students who died while attending residential schools across Canada. The creation of this register was in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's final report and calls to action, which included a directive to create a register to document and honour those who passed away at residential school. At the time of release, the NCTR noted that the register was not complete and that many names of students who died are still unknown.

Biography  Vasilis Ntziachristos is a Full Professor C4/W3 of Medicine and Electrical Engineering and holds the Chair of Biological Imaging at the Technical University of Munich. He is also the Director of the Institute of Biological and Medical Imaging at the Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen and Director of Bioengineering at the Helmholtz Pioneer Campus. He is a founding member and board member of the translational oncology center TranslaTUM and has led developments leading to the foundation of the Munich School of Bioengineering, where he currently serves as the Speaker of the Study Program. Ntziachristos studied electrical engineering at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, magnetic resonance as a Research Fellow at the Panum NMR Core Facility of the University of Copenhagen and at the Department of Radiology at Penn Medicine. He matriculated at the graduate program of the bioengineering department of the University of Pennsylvania where he completed a master's degree and a Ph.D. in bioengineering. His doctoral work, entitled \\"Concurrent magnetic resonance imaging and diffuse optical tomography to probe breast cancer\\", was carried out under the supervision of Britton Chance, Arjun Yodh and Mitchell Schnall. Following graduation Ntziachristos joined the faculty ranks of Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, initially as an instructor (2000) and then as an Assistant Professor (2002) and Director of the Laboratory of Bio-optics and Molecular Imaging. In 2007, he was recruited to Munich into a joint call from the Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen. In 2013, he founded the open-access research journal Photoacoustics, which is the only peer-reviewed journal dedicated entirely to photoacoustic (optoacoustic) research. He currently serves as an editor of Chief of the journal. The journal is served by a Board of highly prominent researchers in the field. For his work he has been awarded several prestigious awards, including the 2013 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize from the German Research Foundation, considered to be the top scientific distinction in Germany and the 2015 Gold Medal of the World Molecular Imaging Society. For more information on his awards see the section on Prizes and Awards. His work often appears in the press. The 2018 anniversary report of the Technical University of Munich features a chapter on Vasilis Ntziachristos, naming him as one of three examples of professors that shape the future of the Technical University of Munich.Brigitte R√∂thlein, Pioneers shape the world of technology - 150 years of research at the Technical University of Munich, Publisher: Wolfgang A. Herrmann,  Research  Ntziachristos is a globally recognized pioneer and entrepreneur in biomedical imaging. One of his focus areas is developing technology for fluorescence- guided surgical procedures for improving the accuracy of tumor removal. He and his collaborators published the first translational study in which a targeted fluorescent agent was systemically injected to distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue during surgery. This approach is now being validated in several clinical trials . In 2012 Ntziachristos was a founding member of SurgVision, a company that has since commercialized technology from this research. SurgVision was recently acquired by Bracco Imaging S.p.A. Recently, Ntziachristos and colleagues have demonstrated early detection of esophageal cancer, significantly improving detection over white light endoscopy. Successful application of this performance may mean life-saving curative procedures for tens of thousands of individuals each year and healthcare savings of several billion EUR per year. Another focus of Ntziachristos' research is developing optoacoustic techniques for breaking thought the penetration barriers of conventional optical imaging methods. His group develops hardware, image reconstruction, spectral unmixing and information processing techniques as well as applications in biology and medicine. Among many other inventions, he is the inventor of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and raster scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), which are non-invasive imaging methods that simultaneously measure different parameters of tissue physiology and pathology non-invasively, allowing new ways to diagnose disease and monitor treatment. MSOT and RSOM are now used in a range of preclinical and clinical studies, including advancing characterization of psoriasis, breast tumors, metastatic melanoma and inflammation in Crohn's disease. MSOT has also been used to visualize metabolism within brown fat, suggesting it may be effective for analyzing muscle energetics and lipid metabolism in a much simpler and more accessible way than with other techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. Ntziachristos is a founder of iThera Medical GmbH, which currently commercializes optoacoustic technology and has placed systems around the world.
