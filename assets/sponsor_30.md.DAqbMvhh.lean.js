Accessed 6 June 2012, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/goodstor.html The new regiment got off to an inauspicious, indeed, a tragic start. Measles broke out among the men almost immediately, and by the time the regiment arrived at its assigned station at Fort Pillow, near Fulton, Tennessee, it had become a full-fledged epidemic. It is possible to track the movements of the regiment in April 1862 by following the bodies. The unfortunate soldiers of the 18th Arkansas were dying in great numbers, and every camp between DeValls Bluff and Fort Pillow contained the graves of those who had died during the night. At Fort Pillow, the regiment was literally decimated by the epidemic. The extremely muddy conditions and very poor quality of the water supply at Fort Pillow undoubtedly contributed to these losses. By the time the epidemic had run its course, over a fourth of the men were dead, discharged or simply stricken from the rolls. The unit remained at Fort Pillow for about two weeks. The unit left Fort Pillow on April 26, moved back to Memphis and then on to Corinth, Mississippi.

The 18th Arkansas fought at the Battle of Iuka, Mississippi, September 16, 1862, and then ensured its place in history at the Second Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, October 4, 1862. From all contemporary accounts, the 18th Arkansas performed with magnificent courage at Corinth. Mustering a little over 300 men on the morning of the battle, only 43 answered the roll at the end of the day. Forming in a line of battle, the 18th Arkansas made a breath- taking charge under an enfilading fire from the entrenched Federal troops. Climbing through and over fallen timber, the 18th Arkansas relentlessly advanced right up to the enemy's breastworks, where the withering fire melted the regiment away. Colonel Daly, leading the charge, sword in hand, was mortally wounded. Captain Parish, of Company H, immediately assumed command and rallied the regiment to continue the charge.

Sorely depleted after the events of April to October 1862, the 18th Arkansas underwent several field consolidations with other units while assigned to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Field consolidations were considered to be temporary, and the component regiments continued to maintain separate muster rolls. On January 7, 1863 Major General Franklin Gardner issued General Order No. 5 which consolidated several under strength Arkansas units: The order was modified in February 1863 and the 18th Arkansas was placed in a consolidated regiment with the 14th and 23rd Arkansas Infantry Regiments.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Camp Price, MS\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 16 December 2004, Accessed 22 May 2012, Logan's consolidated regiment consisted of the 11th and the Griffith's 17th Arkansas. The Johnson's 15th Arkansas was assigned to Crockett's consolidated regiment instead of the 17th. The regiment endured forty-eight day siege, and was surrendered to General Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9, 1863. Following the surrender the officers were sent as prisoners to Johnson's Island Military Prison. Two audacious lieutenants of Company K, however, James W. Hellums and George P. Atkins, escaped from their captors by jumping from the Union transport into the muddy water of the Mississippi River between Napoleon and Helena, swam ashore, and eventually reached the Confederate lines.

When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war-ravaged Arkansas no longer able to subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. Virtually none of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering.

Location and area  The Rastkogel lies five kilometres north-northeast as the crow flies of Vorderlanersbach (municipality of Tux) in the Tuxertal, the westernmost side valley of the Zillertal. Its neighbouring peaks are: to the west, separated by the Nurpensjoch saddle (2,525 m), the Halslspitze at 2,574 metres, and beyond that over the Wattentaler Lizum, the Hirzer (2,725 m). To the north lies the Ro√ükopf (2,576 m) and - jutting far out into the Inn valley - the Gilfert (2,506 m) and, to the east, separated by the Hoarbergjoch (2,590 m), the Pangert at 2,550 metres. Due to its prominent location in the south of the Tuxertal, the Rastkogel is an oft-frequented mountain. At its summit the crest divides like a cross into the three aforementioned directions, although its rock faces are mainly oriented in a north-south direction. To the south the massif drops relatively steeply into the Tuxertal.  Bases and routes to the summit  Ski lifts on the Rastkogel. An ascent of the Rastkogel as an Alpine mountain hike along the normal route, which is the easiest one, takes about 3 hours, approaching from the north along the southeast ridge (S√ºdostgrat) from the Rastkogel Hut (2,117 m). Another route runs from the Weidener Hut (1,799 m) to the northwest over the Haslspitze and the west ridge (Westgrat) taking a good four hours to gain the summit. On the southwest flank of the Rastkogels there is a skiing area that is reached from Vorderlanersbach on a ski lift. A popular route for those staying in Mayrhofen is to take the Penken lift to the top station and then walk along route 23 to Penkenjoch with views across the Zillertal Alps. Route 57 should then be followed (clearly signposted) past the Wanglalm hut. Route 57 then climbs up to the summit of the Wanglspitze at 2420m continuing on to Hoarbergjoch at 2590m. Continue NNW along route 57 until it joins route 51. Continue along route 51 which becomes steeper until the ridge is reached. Turn west along a well marked trail that leads to the summit of Rastkogel. The final km involves some mild scrambling. The recommended time for the walk is 3.5 to 4 hours each way. These timings are for an average walker in good conditions. The Penken lift starts at 9.00 am and the last trip down is at 4.30pm (2011). It is worth checking before starting as if there are no more lifts it is another 2 to 3 hours walking down to Mayrhofen. (The 1:35000 Mayr map 33 Zillertaller Alpen has all the route numbers for the area clearly marked.)

The car is the successor to the SSC Aero and is the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC. This car is recognized as the world's fastest production car. On October 10, 2020, using a closed stretch of road on State Route 160 near Las Vegas, Nevada, it made a run, and a run in the opposite direction with an average speed of dethroning the Koenigsegg Agera RS. Initially powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine; eventually, the capacity of the engine was reduced to 5.9-liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm. SSC has stated that the power output would be at or on E85 fuel, along with the top speed goal of . Overview SSC Tuatara concept SSC began working on the development of the successor of the SSC Ultimate Aero in 2011. The new car named the Tuatara was previewed in concept form at the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. In August 2018, seven years after the debut of the concept, the production version of the Tuatara was shown to the general public. Designed by ex- Pininfarina designer Jason Castriota, the car takes inspiration from the aerospace industry. The Tuatara is named after the reptile, found only in New Zealand, known for having the fastest molecular evolution of any living animal. SSC claims the Tuatara has the lowest drag coefficient in its class at 0.279. The car has a carbon-fiber body construction with aluminum crumple zones and incorporates active aerodynamics. The interior contains leather and Alcantara upholstery and the functions of the car are controlled through a touch screen located on the center console. There is a configurable instrument panel behind the steering wheel displaying important information about the car's status along with a 300 mph speedometer. The car uses a camera system instead of traditional side-view mirrors. SSC claims that the interior can seat a 6-foot 5-inch tall person wearing a helmet. The Tuatara will be produced at a purpose-built facility in West Richland, Washington, and production will be limited to 100 cars. SSC has partnered with Nelson Racing Engines to build the engine, Linder Power Systems for engine sub-assembly fabrication and Automac for the production of the 7-speed automated manual transmission. The transmission was later revealed to be a 7-speed automated manual manufactured by CIMA. The car has the following driving modes: \\"Sport\\", \\"Track\\" and \\"Lift\\". In Sport mode, the ride height is 4 in at the front and 4.5 in at the rear. In Track mode, the ride height lowers to 2.75 in at the front and 3.75 in at the rear. The Lift mode is designed to protect the underbody of the car while driving over speed bumps or driveways. The Tuatara is offered with two configurations, a \\"high-speed\\" configuration and a \\"high- downforce\\" configuration. The first customer car was delivered during the Monterey Car Week and was unveiled at the Philadelphia Motor Show on February 7, 2020. On October 10, 2020, the Tuatara became the fastest production car in the world with a two-way average of 508.5 km/h (316.11 mph) and a peak speed of 532.8 km/h (331.15 mph). The car was piloted by British racing driver Oliver Webb.

Many bloodhounds are freed to search for him, but one of them, Droopy, remains behind and informs the audience that he is the hero of the story. He initially moved very slowly, but he still quickly finds the wolf who tries to escape from Droopy throughout the picture. At one point, he even fled away from Droopy by boarding a taxi, a train, a ship, and an aircraft. However, everywhere he flees Droopy pops up and sarcastically greeted the wolf. Ultimately, Droopy ends the pointless chase by dropping a huge boulder on the wolf's head and crushes him.

Y. Yunioshi is a fictional character in Blake Edwards' 1961 American romantic comedy film Breakfast at Tiffany's, which was adapted for the screen by George Axelrod based on Truman Capote's 1958 novella of the same title. The character in the film is significantly different from the character as presented in Capote's original novella, and the film version of Mr. Yunioshi, as portrayed by Mickey Rooney, has been the subject of extensive critical commentary and review since its theatrical release due to its utilization of ethnic stereotypes. Critical response Upon release In the early 1960s and before, racist humor was widely accepted in American culture, although this general attitude began to change later in that decade, and more so afterwards. In 1961, The New York Times review of the film said that \\"Mickey Rooney's bucktoothed, myopic Japanese is broadly exotic.\\" Some reviewers of the day did note an issue over the characterization. James Powers' review in The Hollywood Reporter stated, \\"Mickey Rooney gives his customary all to the part of a Japanese photographer, but the role is a caricature and will be offensive to many.\\"The Hollywood Reporter: \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" by James Powers, October 5, 1961. In Variety, Larry Tubelle wrote simply, \\"Mickey Rooney‚Äôs participation as a much-harassed upstairs Japanese photographer adds an unnecessarily incongruous note to the proceedings.\\"Film review: Breakfast at Tiffany's, by Larry Tubelle, October 6, 1961. Since 1990 In 1990, The Boston Globe described Rooney's portrayal as \\"an irascible bucktoothed nerd and an offensive ethnic caricature\\". In 1993, the Los Angeles Daily News wrote that the role \\"would have been an offensive stereotype even played by an Asian; the casting of Mickey Rooney added insult to injury\\". The portrayal was referenced in the 1993 film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story as an example of Hollywood's racist attitudes about Asians that the Chinese Bruce Lee's success as a film star would challenge. Specifically, when Lee and his girlfriend Linda Emery watch Breakfast at Tiffany's in the theater, where despite laughing at the character, Linda suggests they leave midway through the picture after she notices that Bruce is upset at Rooney's stereotypical depiction. Since 2000 More recent characterizations include as an uncomfortable \\"stereotype\\", \\"painful, misguided\\", \\"overtly racist\\" and \\"Orientalist\\", \\"one of the most egregiously horrible 'comic' impersonations of an Asian ... in the history of movies\\", and a portrayal \\"border[ing] on offensive\\" that is a \\"double blow to the Asian community ‚Äì not only is he fatuous and uncomplimentary, but he is played by a Caucasian actor in heavy makeup.\\" Similarities between the character of Mr. Yunioshi and anti-Japanese wartime propaganda in the United States have been noticed by critics Jeff Yang and David Kerr. A free outdoor screening in Sacramento, California, scheduled for August 23, 2008, was replaced with the animated film Ratatouille after protests about the Yunioshi character. The protest was led by Christina Fa of the Asian American Media Watch. A screening was shown August 11, 2011 at Brooklyn Bridge Park's \\"Movies with a View\\" series in New York. Due to protests from a multi-ethnic group organized by an online petition at Change.org, the screening also included a short statement by the organizers which acknowledged and validated community concerns about Yunioshi and a brief documentary about Rooney's character and the portrayal of Asian Americans in other films that was edited from a DVD extra for the anniversary DVD. The aforementioned editorial in the New York Daily News by columnist Jeff Yang offered an alternative view regarding the protests: \\"Far from boycotting the movie or even begrudgingly accepting it, I think it should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to fully understand who we are as a culture, how far we've come and how far we still need to go.\\" Response to criticism In a 2008 interview about the film, Rooney said he was shocked to hear that his role as Yunioshi had been branded racist by several Asian- American activists. Rooney said he was heartbroken about the criticism: \\"Blake Edwards...wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director. They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it....Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it‚Äînot one complaint. Every place I've gone in the world people say, 'God, you were so funny.' Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, 'Mickey, you were out of this world.'\\" Rooney also said that if he had known people would be so offended, \\"I wouldn't have done it. Those that didn't like it, I shall castrate myself in shame and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and lets have peace.\\" The 2009 DVD re-release of the film included what was described as \\"a brief and necessary featurette on the character of Mr. Yunioshi, offering an Asian perspective on 'yellow face'\\". Other media A 2013 Broadway show based on the film cast Japanese-American actor James Yaegashi as a culturally assimilated Japanese-American Yunioshi born in California, as the character was written in Capote's original book.

Life He was second of the five sons of Edmond Lisle of Tandridge, Surrey; the family probably took its name from the Isle of Ely. His mother was Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Rudston of Cambridgeshire. His father's sister Mary was mother by her second husband of Thomas Ravis, later bishop of London, at whose request L'Isle composed an epigram against Andrew Melvill. He was also related to Sir Henry Spelman the antiquary. His eldest brother, George, settled at South Petherton in Somerset. Of his younger brothers, Edmund became sewer of the chamber to Queen Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I, and captain of Walmer Castle; Nicholas and Thomas respectively married the two daughters of Nicholas Brooke, sewer of the chamber to Elizabeth. L'Isle was a scholar at Eton College, and in 1584 entered King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1589 and M.A. in 1592 and became a Fellow of his college. He resigned his fellowship after 1608 in order to take possession of an estate which had been left him in the ancestral home at Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire. Subsequently, L'Isle became one of the esquires extraordinary to James I. He returned to Cambridge and spent most of his time there. He took part in a violent quarrel in King's College in August 1608, which resulted in the wounding of the vice-chancellor Roger Goad. Goad brought the matter to the notice of the chancellor, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury; L'Isle then wrote submitting to Salisbury's jurisdiction and begging not to be deprived for his offence, citing thirty years' study in the university, and no action was apparently taken against him. L'Isle was taken ill at Chesterton Cambridgeshire, and was moved to Wilbraham, where he died in September 1637. Like his younger brother Edmund, who died a month later, he was buried at Walmer, where a monument to their memory was erected in the church. Works Lisle was a pioneer in the study of Anglo-Saxon. He is one of the known owners of the E manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the so- called Peterborough Chronicle, in which he made notes on interleaved pages. Interest in the doctrinal position of the early English church on various points in controversy in his day first led him in that direction. In 1623 he printed and published for the first time, with an English translation, the ‚ÄòTreatise on the Old and New Testament,‚Äô by √Ülfric Grammaticus, whom Lisle wrongly identified with √Ülfric of Abingdon the archbishop of Canterbury. Lisle found the manuscript in Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's library (Bodl. Laud E. 19).The long title begins ‚ÄòA Saxon Treatise concerning the Old and New Testament, written about the time of King Edgar (700 yeares agoe) by √Ülfricus Abbas, thought to be the same that was afterward Archbishop of Canterbury, whereby appeares what was the canon of Holy Scripture here then received, and that the Church of England had it so long agoe in her mother-tongue.‚Äô An appendix contained ‚Äòthe Homilies and Epistles of the fore-said √Ülfricus,‚Äô and a second edition of ‚ÄòA Testimonie of Antiquitie, etc., touching the Sacrament of the Bodie and Bloud of the Lord,‚Äô first issued by Archbishop Matthew Parker and Parker's secretary, John Joscelyn in 1566. There follow two extracts from (a) √Ülfric's ‚ÄòEpistle to Walfine, Bishop of Scyrburne,‚Äô and (b) his ‚ÄòEpistle to Wulfstan, Archbishop of York,‚Äô expressing disapproval of a long preservation of the consecrated elements after Easter day. The book concludes with the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and Ten Commandments in Anglo-Saxon, with a verbal interlinear translation intended to serve as exercises for beginners. There was a second edition of this \\"Saxon Treatise\\" under the title of Divers Ancient Monuments in 1638, the year after his death. The major editions of Anglo-Saxon works which he had projected were √Ülfric's translations of the Pentateuch, and the books of Joshua, Judges, and Job, and also the Saxon- English Psalter. Lisle was also the author of some verse. In 1598 he published translations of parts of Du Bartas's Weeks, but no copy is extant. In 1625 appeared a still larger instalment of Du Bartas in English and French, ‚Äòso neare the French Englisshed as may teach an Englishman French, or a Frenchman English. With the commentary of S. G[oulart de] S[enlis].‚Äô The portion translated includes the end of the fourth book of ‚ÄòAdam‚Äô and all four books of ‚ÄòNoah,‚Äô the subjects of the poems for the first two days of the second week. The volume closes with an ‚ÄòEpistle dedicatorie to the Lord Admirall,‚Äô Lord Howard of Effingham dated 1596, and evidently a reprint from the original edition. In 1619 he wrote two Latin hexameter poems addressed to his neighbour, Michael Dalton, and prefixed to the second edition of his Countrey Justice published in that year. In 1628 appeared ‚ÄòVirgil's Eclogues, translated into English by W. L., Gent.,‚Äô with the gloss of Ludovicus Vives. Part of these had been translated as early as 1600, though not published. He brought out in 1631 a rhymed version, with abridgments and additions, of Heliodorus' Aethiopica.Under the title ‚ÄòThe Faire √Üthiopian, dedicated to the King and Queene by their Maiesties most humble Subject and Seruant William L'isle.‚Äô In 1638 there was a reissue of the work with the title ‚ÄòThe Famous Historie of Heliodorus amplified, augmented, and delivered periphrastically in verse.‚Äô Lisle also wrote the verse inscription on the tomb of William Benson, his aunt Mary Lisle's second son by her first husband, who was buried in St Olave's, Southwark.

He was best known as the architect of the Vista House on Crown Point in the Columbia River Gorge. Early life and education Edgar Lazarus was born on June 6, 1868, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was a descendant of the Colonial Jews of Charleston, South Carolina, and was the son of a Confederate soldier. Career Morrow County Courthouse, Heppner, Oregon Clatsop County Courthouse, Astoria, Oregon Vista House Lazarus came to Portland in 1892 with a letter of introduction to a prominent citizen. He formed a partnership with William M. Ellicott that same year. Lazarus & Ellicott continued until 1895, after which Lazarus practiced alone until 1910. For a year he partnered with Morris H. Whitehouse and J. Andr√© Fouilhoux as Lazarus, Whitehouse & Fouilhoux. In 1911, he formed Lazarus & Logan with Frank Logan; the firm lasted until 1914. Lazarus then practiced alone for the rest of his career. He was a member of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and was elected a Fellow of the institute in 1895. Early in his career, Lazarus designed many houses for notable Portlanders, especially among the city's Jewish community. His residential designs were predominantly shingle style, but with Lazarus' unique design, including unusual shapes and extremely steeply pitched roofs. In 1905, he designed the domed Palace of Agriculture for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in the Baroque style. Lazarus also designed early alterations to Pioneer Courthouse, was the resident architect for the U.S. Customhouse, and designed the first Multnomah Athletic Club building at SW 10th and Yamhill streets, all in Portland. When Oregon started licensing architects in 1919, he received license #21 under a grandfather clause. Vista House His most important work, completed in 1918, was the Vista House, an observatory that also serves as a memorial to Oregon pioneers and as a comfort station for travelers on the Historic Columbia River Highway. The building shows great sensitivity to its site at Crown Point in the Columbia River Gorge near Corbett, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). After completing the Vista House, Lazarus was engaged in a long, bitter dispute with the Oregon State Board of Control regarding his fees for both Vista House and his work at the Oregon State Hospital. The controversy brought him unfavorable attention in the press, and this may have harmed his career, as he did little important work after the incident. Works *Frederick V.

Mount Calvary Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery in Columbus, Ohio, located west of downtown next to Green Lawn Cemetery and by the now-abandoned Cooper Stadium. It is the oldest active Catholic cemetery in Franklin County.. It is maintained by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus, and has approximately 40,000 interments over .. Mount Calvary is divided into two sections that were historically paid for and separately maintained by two parishes of different ethnic backgrounds. The north section, \\"Holy Cross,\\" was for the German parish, and the \\"Cathedral\\" section was for the Irish parish. Separating those two sections is the \\"Priests' Circle,\\" reserved for clergy.. History The cemetery was established in part to replace the old St. Patrick's Cemetery, which was located in downtown Columbus and had become encircled by the city's growth.. A plot of just over of land, outside the city's original limits, was purchased in 1865 by John F. Zimmer in trust for the Diocese of Columbus, and burials on the site also began that year. Zimmer purchased an adjoining plot in 1866, and sold the two plots to the Diocese in 1868. The land was further expanded in 1871 by three plots purchased by Father John Ambrose Watterson, later Bishop of Columbus. The cemetery was consecrated in 1874 by Bishop Sylvester Rosecrans. Bishop Rosecrans further directed that no more burials were to be made in the old St. Patrick's Cemetery. The Diocese finally requested in 1887 that burials be moved from there to Mount Calvary, but met resistance from family of the deceased. The controversy was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio, which ruled in the Diocese's favor that the old cemetery was no longer practical to maintain. Burials from St. Jacob Cemetery (also known as Frey Cemetery or German Catholic Cemetery) were also moved to Mount Calvary between 1906 and 1908..

He resided in Antwerp for most of his life. It is possible he travelled to Italy as he made drawings of Italian subjects.Biographical details on the site of the J. Paul Getty Museum The date of his death is not known with certainty and is believed to have occurred between 1687 (the latest date of one of his dated works) and 1707. He was the teacher of the painter of architecture paintings Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey. His son Peter Schubart von Ehrenberg was also an artist who had a successful career as a painter, engraver and stage designer in Vienna. Work General The majority of van Ehrenberg's pictures were painted between 1660 and 1670. He often collaborated with other artists who added the figures or animals. This was a common practice in 17th century Antwerp. His collaborators included Hendrik van Minderhout, Gaspar de Witte, Hieronymus Janssens and Charles Emmanuel Biset. Architectural works A dungeon interior with elegant figures, a collaboration with Hieronymous Janssens Van Ehrenberg painted many architectural paintings usually of imaginary church interiors, temples, palaces and art galleries. Paintings such as the Interior of the Saint-Carolus-Borromeus Church in Antwerp (1667; Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)Interior of the Saint-Carolus-Borromeus Church in Antwerp emphasize the Baroque architecture of the space depicted, but are more artificial than his Dutch Golden Age contemporaries such as Pieter Jansz Saenredam or Emanuel de Witte. His Interior of the St. Peters' Church in Rome stands in the tradition of Antwerp architecture art from the first half of the 17th century. However, the spatial effect in the oeuvre of van Ehrenberg is stronger. He showed a particular preference for the fantastic and pathetic, which he emphasized further with light-dark contrasts and a staffage of almost dwarfish figures (often painted by other artists).Interior of the St. Peters' Church in Rome at vlaamsekunstcollectie Of particular interest are a set of paintings representing the Seven Wonders of the World such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and The Temple of Diana at Ephesus (both in the Mus√©e Henri Dupuis Saint-Omer) and the two paintings of ruined tombstones (both in Oxford College Anon II, University of Oxford). Gallery paintings Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg worked also in the genre of the 'gallery paintings'. The 'gallery paintings' genre is native to Antwerp where Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens. The art galleries depicted were either real galleries or imaginary galleries, sometimes with allegorical figures.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery An example of van Ehrenberg's work in this genre is the Interior of an art collector's cabinet with many visitors (Mus√©e Girodet, Montargis). This is a collaboration with Gaspar de Witte and Hieronymus Janssens. The composition depicts an imaginary art gallery with many visitors who are appreciating and discussing some of the artworks in the gallery. This gallery painting represents a later development in the genre initiated by David Teniers the Younger, which excludes non-art objects from the gallery. The figures in the gallery painting are portrayed as forming part of an elite who possess privileged knowledge of art. The genre of gallery paintings had by that time become a medium to accentuate the notion that the powers of discernment associated with connoisseurship are socially superior to or more desirable than other forms of knowing. The Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) dated to 1666 falls into the category of allegorical picture galleries, which can be considered a sub- category of the imaginary art gallery type. This composition depicts a large imaginary gallery in which are present a number of persons admiring and scrutinizing artworks and, on the right hand side, figures representing gods and allegorical figures. The painting is a collaboration with each of the individual painters whose work is depicted in the painting and have signed their own work: Theodoor Boeyermans (Daughters of Cecrops and Erychtonius), Pieter Boel (Animal Piece), Jan Cossiers (Diana and Actaeon), Cornelis de Heem (Fruit Still Life), Robert van den Hoecke (Winter Landscape), Philips Augustijn Immenraet (Italianate Landscape), Jacob Jordaens (Gyges and Kandaules and Allegory of Painting), Pieter Thijs (Adoration of the Shepherds), Lucas van Uden (Landscape) and the monogrammists missed PB (Fish Still Life) and PVI or PVH (Satyr and Nymph). Van Ehrenberg painted the architecture as well as the ceiling (which is made up of copies of Rubens' works for the Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp) (later destroyed in a fire). The figures are probably by Charles Emmanuel Biset.Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Other such collaborations between multiple Antwerp painters on picture gallery paintings are recorded.

She is noted for her work in photography and for her multifaceted interests in mixed media and visual presentation, particularly in fashion and its relation to identity, as well as for having dated actress Amber Heard.https://aah- magazine.co.uk/2019/will-the-amber-heard-case-be-a-turning-point-for-male- victims-of-domestic-abuse/  Early life and education  Van Ree is of Japanese-Dutch descent. She was raised in Mililani, Hawaii and was a surfer. She took a photography course in high school and became serious about the craft in her senior year. In 1994, van Ree moved to Los Angeles to attend college, but she eventually dropped out.  Career  Van Ree is known for her black-and-white photographs of celebrities, including Michelle Rodriguez, Katherine Moennig and Matt Dallas. She has said that black and white photography \\"contains a certain presence; it takes the subject matter and ignites a certain lyrical quality within it that one cannot express in words.\\" Van Ree's use of the medium is particularly concerned with the way that the black and white image conveys a sense of time and timelessness, and that the contrast of her modern subjects with the temporal associations of the medium is a source of the intriguing qualities of her photographs. In several interviews, she refers to actress Amber Heard as her main muse: \\"Gala is to Salvador Dali, Kiki de Montparnasse is to Man Ray, Beatrice is to Dante Alighieri.\\" In the 2014 exhibit A State of Mind & Affairs of its Games, van Ree displayed a contrast in both subject matter and medium for her photography. The photos exhibited portrayed toys and popular objects, and were printed in full color. Her work has been exhibited in several cities and magazines. She has been exhibited both as a solo photographer and with other notable artists, including Gus Van Sant, Amy Arbus, David Lynch, and Jessica Lange. Her work is also featured in private collections. In addition to photography, van Ree makes short films and works in other visual media, including painting and pencil drawings. In her drawings, she finds inspiration in her dreams, and has undertaken drawing as an attempt to give the images of her dreams tangibility. This dream-drawing, according to Van Ree, also creates a sense of familiarity with her waking life. She also has designed text-based T-shirts, which she calls \\"DieWilder\\" and wears herself in public appearances. In August 2015, Van Ree contributed a poem to the \\"A Letter to My Younger Self\\" series on the blog for the fashion and home decor online store, The Dreslyn.

Personal life  Van Ree is frequently noted for her signature hat both by interviewers and in self-reflection on how her fashion choices relate to her identity. Van Ree views accessories in fashion as \\"details of the outfit,\\" and expresses an interest in the concept of details in general. In a spoken-word interview video for the \\"Be You\\" Project with Genetic, Van Ree says her hat expresses that she is \\"a cowboy at heart... part alien, part cowboy, part male, part female... I think you become what you wear, and your personality kind of aligns with what you look like from the outside.\\" She was in a relationship with actress Amber Heard until 2012. She still has a tattoo of Heard's name on her arm, a detail revealed during an interview with StyleLikeU in 2013. In 2016, Van Ree was in a relationship with model Caroline Vreeland, great-granddaughter of Diana Vreeland. In interviews, she has discussed her interest in the food and arts culture of Los Angeles, and has expressed those aesthetics in her art.

Debrett's Ltd., 2009. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 19 July 2011. (born 1962) is a British photographer and film director. Life and career Born in Birmingham, Venville was the child of deaf parents. He was, in the words of his uncle, \\"caught in some no-man's land between the deaf world and the hearing world.\\" Venville attended Solihull College (1981‚Äì83) and Polytechnic of Central London (1983‚Äì86), graduating with honors with a BA in film, video, and photographic arts. Breaking out with a campaign for Wrangler in 1991, he became an acclaimed and sought-after advertising and fashion photographer. In 1992, he began directing commercials, starting with an advertisement for Audi. Venville has three books of photography. Layers (2003) is a collection of Venville's advertising, celebrity, fashion, and personal photography. Lucha Loco (2006) is a collection of over a hundred portraits of lucha libre wrestlers taken on a 2005 trip to Mexico. His third monograph The Women of Casa X,http://www.schiltpublishing.com/publishing/authors/malcolm-venville/ portraits of elderly prostitutes from Casa Xochiquetzal in the infamous Tepito district of Mexico City, was published by Schilt Publishing in 2013. His short film career began with Silent Film (1997), an 11-minute film documenting the romance of his deaf parents. He also directed a pair of short documentaries about actresses in small memorable roles: Remembering Sister Ruth (1997), about actress Kathleen Byron, who played the disturbed nun Sister Ruth in Black Narcissus (1947), and the 15 minute Remembering Miss Torso (2004), about actress Georgine Darcy, who played the voluptuous neighbor Miss Torso in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). Venville initially turned down a number of offers to direct feature films, including Coyote Ugly, because he wished his feature film debut to be a planned movie called Deaf Road, about his uncle's attempts to lose his virginity in Tangiers. It would be entirely in sign language, which Orlando Bloom had pledged to learn to star in the film. Venville's feature film debut was 44 Inch Chest (2009), a gangster film starring Ray Winstone, John Hurt, Tom Wilkinson and Ian McShane. It reunited the writers and some of the cast of an earlier British gangster film, Sexy Beast (2000). He also directed Henry's Crime (2010), a romantic comedy starring Keanu Reeves, James Caan, and Vera Farmiga.

History The site of Poggio Colla preserved undisturbed habitation layers of Etruscans; it appears to have been inhabited by Etruscans at least as early as 7th century and was abandoned or destroyed in the late 3rd century BCE. The site suffered a violent destruction and was rebuilt during the Hellenistic period. Excavation The first excavations of Poggio Colla were directed by Francesco Nicosia from 1968 to 1972. From 1995 to 2012, the site was excavated annually by the Mugello Valley Archaeological Project (MVAP) under the direction of Gregory Warden and Michael Thomas; MVAP is sponsored by Southern Methodist University and the University of Pennsylvania. Excavations have revealed fortification walls, a necropolis area, and the remains of an archaic monumental building (possibly, a temple).  Research  The faunal remains recovered from Poggio Colla primarily contains the remains of cattle, sheep/goat and pig, as well as the remains of dog and wild species. The relative importance of pigs increases over time; this trend is linked to intensification of meat production and rising urban populations. Similar faunal assemblages have been found in other Etruscan settlements. A black-glaze olpe filled with one hundred Roman silver victoriati was discovered in 2001 in the west end of the Poggio Colla acropolis. The significance of the finding is that it is found in the context of a sanctuary and it was buried after the sanctuary was destroyed in the late 3rd century BCE. The use of a rounded molding on the base of monumental tombs, temples and altars is the characteristic of Etruscan architecture; and it was consistent between 6th to 2nd century B.C. in different Etruscan cities. A large number of such moldings was discovered in Poggio Colla; the large single or double round fits into the known pattern of Etruscan architecture.THE ARCHITECTURAL MOLDINGS AT POGGIO COLLA A large number of roof tiles of the monumental structure on the Poggio Colla acropolis and workshop/farmhouse of Podere Funghi has been discovered during ongoing excavation. A geochemical study has been done in an attempt to characterize the composition of ceramics, tiles and the local sediments discovered at the site of Poggio Colla.Weaver, I., Meyers, G. E., Mertzman, S. A., Sternberg, R., & Didaleusky, J. (2013). GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE FOR INTEGRATED CERAMIC AND ROOF TILE INDUSTRIES AT THE ETRUSCAN SITE OF POGGIO COLLA, ITALY. Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry, 13(1). Using methods like X-ray, petrography, thermogravimetric analysis, macroscopic observations, it is found that typical pottery sherds and tile fragments constituent of abundant quartz, feldspar, minor amount of mica, lithic, and grog. The compositions of tiles and pottery of Poggio Colla and Podere Funghi are similar, but the rock and sediment specimens were different; which supports the hypothesis that diverse ceramic industry co- existed in close proximity to Poggio Colla acropolis. Paleoethnobotanical studies have been done at Poggio CollaPALEOETHNOBOTANY RESEARCH to identify the plants utilized by the Etruscans; this could provide potential information about Etruscan diet and common plants used in weaving. The soil samples from features and stratum, are floated to obtain botanical remains, which includes modern roots, charcoal, whole seeds, and seed fragments. Thus far, the identified seeds include cereal, mainly barley, wheat, broad beans, chickpeas, and grape pips. This is an ongoing research of MVAP. Findings This excavation resulted in two highly significant archaeological discoveries: a stone stele \\"evidence of a permanent religious cult with monumental dedications, at least as early as the Late Archaic Period, from about 525 to 480 B.C. Its re-use in the foundations of a slightly later sanctuary structure points to deep changes in the town and its social structure.\\". The stele itself is 226.8 kg, and roughly 1.2 m in height, with approximately 120 Etruscan characters along the sides, making the stele the source of one of the longest inscriptions in the Etruscan language, which has eluded comprehension from scholars since its initial discovery. The inscription attests to Uni being the primary recipient of worship and sacrifice at the Poggio Colla sacred site. The head archaeologist, Gregory Warden, stated that ‚Äúthe slab was discovered embedded in the foundations of a monumental temple where it had been buried for more than 2,500 years. At one time it would have been displayed as an imposing and monumental symbol of authority.‚Äù The second significant discovery was the birth-stamp; a small image of a woman giving birth that was found on a shard of bucchero pottery. The image shows the head and shoulders of a baby emerging from the mother, who is represented with her face in profile, with one arm raised, thought to be holding on to possibly a tree for support. The artifact‚Äôs closest Etruscan iconographic parallels‚Äîthe scenes found on the Archaic relief slabs from Tarquinia‚Äîillustrate a crouching female but without the baby. Additional Etruscan scenes combine the crouching pose with a range of animals, suggesting an association with the ‚ÄúMistress of the Animals.‚Äù A survey of the few related images from around the Mediterranean not only establishes the rarity of childbirth images in the classical world but also the uniquely Etruscan character of the shard‚Äôs imagery. When its context‚Äîa redeposited occupation stratum of a settlement dated to the end of the Orientalizing period‚Äîis assessed in conjunction with its iconography, it becomes possible to view the stamp‚Äôs imagery as alluding to concepts of fertility and reproduction tied to the power of nature and regeneration, all of which would have been appropriate in an Etruscan banqueting context attended by elite men and women.

Plot  The film opens with a portentous observation by King Nimrod's chief stargazer. He witnesses one star consuming four surrounding stars, after which an ethereal light emanating from the remaining star bathes one house in the city of Ur Ka≈õdim, the seat of Nimrod's kingdom. Inside this home, a baby has been born to Nimrod's general Terakh and his wife, Amaslei. Spurred by his stargazer's warnings of impending rebellion by this infant, Nimrod orders young Abraham put to death. Terakh deceives Nimrod and furnishes the baby of his servant girl to take Abraham's place. Amaslei flees, and for the next several years she rears Avraham in hiding. Early on, Avraham displays high intelligence and he quickly arrives at the conclusion of a singular god. Emboldened by his discovery of God in a pervasively polytheistic land, he returns to Ur Ka≈õdim where he assumes a janitorial position at his father's idol shop. One day, Utz visits the shop to buy an idol. Abraham innocently asks Utz to explain how an inanimate idol of stone can provide for and he urges Utz to disavow idolatry. Then, after destroying all the idols in the shop, Avraham places the mallet into the hand of a stone likeliness of Nimrod, the largest idol in the shop and attempts to mollify his father Terakh, insisting that the idol of Nimrod was the perpetrator of the iconoclasm. Enraged by the carnage of his idols, Terakh permits Nimrod's men to frogmarch his son to Nimrod to be condemned for his blasphemous and treasonable actions. Abraham breaks loose of the guard's grip en route the palace, and finds himself on the run once again. After a fortuitous encounter with an angel, who saves him from certain death in the desert, Abraham is led by the angel to the yeshiva of Noah. Noah takes Abraham under his wing and eventually instructs a now-matured and grown up Abraham to return to Ur Ka≈õdim and smash the pyramid of Mesopotamian idolatry. The final scene of the film is a showdown in which Abraham defiantly refuses to acknowledge Nimrod's bald self-declaration as \\"God Supreme\\" of the world. An infuriated Nimrod hurls Abraham into a bonfire, but he miraculously survives before the eyes of a repentant Nimrod, who now recognizes the God of Abraham and instructs his people to convert to Abraham's monotheistic beliefs.  Cast  * Adam Koren as Abraham * Burney Lieberman as Nimrod * Pichas Blitt as Noach  Production  Drawing on the Bible, Midrash and numerous commentaries, Rabbis Yisroel Bernath and Zvi Hershcovich researched and wrote the first draft of the script. A production of Bible Kids Club, the film was produced for direct-to-video release by Big Bang Digital Studios. The film was directed by Todd Shaffer and produced by Oliver Cohen, Charlie Cohen, Moshe Dayan and Sidney El Hadad. The four-year-long project was produced at a budget of $1.8 million. The film was released in 2011.  Reception  Young Abraham has been well received by audiences and has garnered positive reviews. In a feature article for Lubavitch News Service/Lubavitch.com, Mendy Rimler wrote, \\"...the climax and message of the CGI (computer generated imagery) animated motion picture, a vivid and compelling retelling of the biblical and Midrashic story of Abraham‚Äôs discovery of God: At last, kosher entertainment with Jewish and visual depth.\\" The Dove Foundation awarded Young Abraham five doves, their highest rating.

It is a sequel to the novel Sideways, which was made into a successful 2004 film of the same name. The novel takes place seven years after the events depicted in Sideways. It contains the same characters as in the earlier novel: Miles, a writer, his friend Jack, a sometime actor, and Miles' mother Phyllis, all wine lovers. Miles is now a successful author, having written a novel called \\"Shameless\\" with much the same situations as the real- life Sideways. Like Sideways, \\"Shameless\\" has been adapted as a successful movie. Jack, who had been prosperous in Sideways, is now divorced and short of cash. Pickett says that the character Jack is based on his friend Roy Gittens, a film electrician. The novel recounts a road trip involving the three and a Filipina caretaker, Joy, as they head first to Oregon's Willamette Valley for the International Pinot Noir Celebration, and then to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where Phyllis is to live with her sister, Alice. The book was self-published by Pickett. He has said that the book is autobiographical, saying: \\"The trip didn‚Äôt happen with Jack, but everything with my mother was real. I lived that, and Jack is that character now, he‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs gone to seed. And I am a guy who‚Äôs had success and overimbibed and did some things that I don‚Äôt do anymore.\\" Plot As the novel begins, Miles agrees to take his ailing mother, Phyllis, to live with her sister in Wisconsin. He convinces Jack to tag along as wingman in return for some cash, hires a pot-smoking Filipina caretaker, Joy, to attend to his mother, and recovers Phyllis's beloved Yorkie, Snapper, from one of his ex-girlfriends. They then set out on a trek that takes them up the California coastline and to Oregon wine country for a wild pinot noir festival. Through it all, the four have many conflicts and misadventures, as well as sexual escapades. Snapper gets into an accident and ultimately loses a leg, and Phyllis and Joy are constantly quarreling. The tensions come to a head in Oregon, where Joy abruptly quits after being falsely accused of stealing money from Phyllis. Jack goes back to California, and Miles is forced to drive with his mother to Wisconsin. He quits drinking. In Wisconsin, Phyllis's sister has difficulty coping with Phyllis. His mother has another stroke and is hospitalized, and at her request Miles causes her death with an overdose of Seconal. At the end, Miles plans to travel to Barcelona, Spain, to be with a woman he met during the trip. Critical reaction The Hollywood Reporter called Vertical \\"a real change in direction from Sideways. The latter is a classic buddy story, the new novel a mother- and-son story.\\" The reviewer said that \\"Pickett is no prose stylist, but his character depictions are ruthlessly vivid and clear. Everyone is the captain of his or her own fate; blame belongs where it belongs, which is not on bad fathers, absent mothers or demanding ex-wives.\\" The assisted suicide at the end, he said, \\"makes perfect sense; it‚Äôs one of supreme compassion and renewed hope.\\" The New York Review of Books called Vertical \\"an entertaining and touching book\\" and \\"laugh-out-loud funny.\\" The reviewer noted that, contrary to the usual conventions of sequels, the Miles of Sideways is not the Miles of Vertical, because the novel \\"Shameless\\" (the proxy for Sideways) is described in Vertical as fictionalized. For instance, the \\"Martin\\" of \\"Shameless,\\" like the Miles of Sideways, is described as being a wine expert, while the Miles of Vertical is described as not a wine expert and leaning heavily on a wine reference book. Film adaptation Alexander Payne, who directed the film adaptation of Sideways, has indicated that he is not interested in directing a sequel to the film based on Vertical. Fox Searchlight owns the rights to the characters, but Payne's lack of interest makes the film a non-starter for Fox. Anticipating a sequel to the film Sideways, Pickett deliberately omitted the character Terra from Vertical. In the film Sideways, Terra was played by Sandra Oh, who was married to Payne. Pickett said that, because Oh made many script changes which Pickett disliked, he eliminated her character from Vertical so that he would not have to work with Oh if a sequel was made. Stage and musical adaptions In 2019 it was announced that Sideways was scheduled to adapted for a Broadway musical. A play adapted by author Rex Pickett from the Sideways novel was produced at multiple theaters in the United States and the United Kingdom, including at the La Jolla Playhouse. In addition to the musical, it was reported that Rex Pickett had written screenplays based on his two Sideways sequels already in print, Vertical and Sideways 3 Chile.

In a racing career which lasted from July 2010 until September 2011 she won five of her eight races. After winning two of her three races in 2010, she was an upset winner of the 1000 Guineas on her first start as a three-year-old. She was beaten when favourite for The Oaks but returned to record further Group One successes in the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks. She ran poorly in the St Leger in autumn and was retired from racing after sustaining an injury early in 2012. Background Blue Bunting is a grey filly bred in Kentucky by B. M. Kelley. In August 2009, the yearling filly was consigned to the Saratoga sales where she was bought for $200,000 by Anthony Stroud, acting on behalf of Godolphin Racing. Her sire was the American stallion Dynaformer whose other progeny include Barbaro, Americain and Lucarno. Racing career 2010: two-year-old season Blue Bunting ran three times as a two-year-old and was ridden on each occasion by Ahmed Ajtebi. On her debut at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 July she finished second in a seven furlong maiden race, five lengths behind the winner Theysken's Theory. Two weeks later she was moved up in distance for a one-mile maiden at Doncaster Racecourse. She started the 6/4 favourite and recorded her first win by beating Midnight Caller by half a length. On 30 October, Blue Bunting stepped up in class to contest the Listed Montrose Stakes at Newmarket. She was sent to the front in the straight, and after being overtaken she rallied \\"gamely\\" to regain the lead and win by a length from the favourite Elas Diamond. 2011: three-year-old season As part of the Godolphin team, Blue Bunting spent the winter being prepared in Dubai before being returned to Newmarket in spring. As both her breeding and style of racing suggested that she would be most effective at middle distances, and she was not among the leading fancies for the 1000 Guineas, which was run over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 1 May. The French-trained filly Moonlight Cloud was made 9/2 favourite in a field of eighteen runners, with Blue Bunting, ridden by Frankie Dettori starting at 16/1. Blue Bunting looked outpaced in the early stages and was towards the back of the field until half way. She then began to make progress along the rail, taking the lead well inside the final furlong and winning by three-quarters of a lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Together. Dettori described the win as a \\"great and pleasant surprise\\" and pointed out that the filly had been particularly well-suited by the strong pace. On 3 June Blue Bunting was moved up in distance to contest the Investec Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She started the 9/4 favourite ahead of the O'Brien runners Wonder of Wonders and Misty For Me. She turned into the straight in seventh place but when switched to the outside to obtain a clear run she could make little impression on the leaders and finished fourth to the 20/1 outsider Dancing Rain. Dettori eased the filly down in the closing stages, losing third place on the line, and receiving a suspension from riding as result. In July Blue Bunting started second favourite for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She was not among the leaders until the final furlong, but then made rapid progress on the outside to catch Banimpire in the last strides and won by a short head. A month later, she raced against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Yorkshire Oaks. Starting the 11/4 favourite, she took the lead in the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length from the four-year-old Vita Nova. Blue Bunting was matched against colts for the first time in the Ladbrokes St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. In a field of nine runners she started the 7/2 second favourite behind the Michael Stoute-trained Sea Moon. She was never in serious contention and finished sixth behind Masked Marvel. Breeding record Blue Bunting returned to Dubai for the winter and was prepared for a run in the Dubai Sheema Classic. In February she sustained a leg injury in training and was officially retired from racing. She was bred to Street Cry in 2012.https://www.paulickreport.com/news/bloodstock/dual-classic- winner-blue-bunting-retired-will-be-bred-to-street-cry/ 2013 BLUE CREEK (GB) : Bay gelding, foaled 22 February, by Street Cry (IRE) ‚Äì won once and placed twice from three starts at Meydan, UAE 2016. 2014 BLUE ILLUSION (GB) : Bay filly, foaled 25 February, by Dubawi (IRE) ‚Äì won 1 race and placed once from 8 starts in England and France. 2015 FLAG FESTIVAL (GB): Grey gelding, foaled 9 March, by New Approach (IRE) ‚Äì won 1 race from 6 starts England to date. 2016 BLUE MOUNTAIN(GB): Grey gelding, foaled 8 May, by Dansili (GB) ‚Äì placed three times from 7 starts.

Artists, whether still studying or having recently graduated, are given opportunities to make contacts and gain professional experience outside of their educational institutions. For the annual exhibition, artists are invited to submit a portfolio of work, from which a selection is made by a panel of judges. The selection is made by artists and writers, and often the selector will have previously been exhibited in a New Contemporaries show. Founded in 1949 as the \\"Young Contemporaries\\", the exhibition has run annually as a means to provide an impartial and democratic stepping stone from arts education to the professional art sector. Established hierarchies that might otherwise become set within the art school system are able to be assessed without bias through the anonymous selection process. Selectors have in the past included Ryan Gander (2013), Rosalind Nashashibi (2012), Pablo Bronstein (2011), Michael Landy (2007), Angus Fairhurst (2006), Jane and Louise Wilson (2005), Tacita Dean (2004), Rebecca Warren (2003), Sarah Lucas (2002), Chris Ofili (2001), Gavin Turk (2000) and Susan Hiller (1999). An annual exhibition for the final selection of New Contemporaries is staged in a leading UK arts venue; New Contemporaries has exhibited as part of the Liverpool Biennial since its launch in 1999. The importance of regional impartiality is recognised in the anonymity of the contributor's school, age, and nationality during the selection process and by the annual exhibition having no fixed location. A catalogue is printed to accompany the exhibition each year.  Background   1949‚Äì1970  The first annual exhibition, initiated by Carel Weight for the British Society of Artists Galleries, was established in 1949 and known as 'Young Contemporaries'. In the foreword to the 1949 exhibition catalogue, Philip Hendy, then Director of the National Gallery, wrote of his \\"hope that it is only the first of many. That it may grown into an annual event.\\" The early exhibition gathered much critical and audience attention. Howard Hodgkin recollected that ‚Äúthe most memorable event at the opening of the first show was the speech made by Philip Hendy. With extraordinary generosity and frankness and somehow with a lot of sympathy as well, he compared what he felt to be the bleak but possible heroic fate awaiting us when we left Art School to the cosy, hierarchical life of an Art Historian.‚Äù From 1949 until 1969, the contributors were selected by artists and art specialists, but then in 1969 and 1970 students controlled selection themselves. Notable artists who participated in these early exhibitions include Eduardo Paolozzi (1958), Dorothy Mead (1959, the first woman president and later the first woman president of the London Group), David Hockney (1960), Patrick Caulfield (1961), Ray Atkins (1964), Robyn Denny (1964), Keith Milow (1967), Derek Jarman (1967) and Gerard Hemsworth (1967). Andrew Lambirth wrote in 1986 that ‚Äúit wasn't until 1969 that the year that the colour cover of the catalogue looked like an Alpine Advertisement for poster paint ‚Äì that the students decided to take over selection themselves. This controversial move was the logical if belated reaction to establishment colonization of the YC. Wasn't the whot supposed to be for the students, by the students?‚Äù The 1970 exhibition, held at the Royal Academy, caused great controversy with one of the events nearly setting fire to the Royal Academy. Other sources claim funding was withdrawn because the organisation had dissolved into strife between college factions. The exhibition was not staged again until 1974.  1974‚Äì1986  In 1973, tutors from some London colleges - including Gillian Ayres, Paul Huxley and William Tucker ‚Äì grouped together to restore the exhibition. They took a year to draw up a new constitution, arrange a willing venue, and organise the selection process. Taking place at the Camden Arts Centre in 1974, the exhibition was renamed New Contemporaries. The Guardian reviewed the 1975 show as being ‚Äúlow on razzmatazz and high on endeavour‚Äù. William Tucker wrote in the catalogue introduction that ‚Äúthe successful student these days is likely to be persuaded that is he an artist. Nothing could be further from the truth. What the NC should do is enable students, for a moment at last as artists, to take public responsibility for what that have made ‚Äì absolutely... This is not an exhibition of protest, but could become the opportunity for commitment. It is the harder role.‚Äù The 1976 exhibition was staged at the Acme Gallery, 43 Shelton Street, Covent Garden Poster for the exhibitionand included a programmes of Live Art,(May 31st until June 5th), from Jeremy Diggle, Terry Duffy, Marty St James, Charlie Process, Elaine Shemilt, et al. Scan of typewritten document showing a running order of live performances at Acme Gallery From 1978, the exhibition had an established exhibition venue in the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) and a Permanent Committee supported the exhibition management until 1983. The selection of contributors was made by panels of students, divided between the specialisms of painting, sculpture, and performance/film. However, the students soon began to realise that the current format for the exhibition was unsustainable, and many organisers were left with personal debt. In one interesting movement toward complete democratisation, the 1981 committee ‚Äúin order to encourage a larger entry of works‚Äù asked for all submissions to be made in the form of slides and then created a slideshow that could be arranged at will ‚Äúto give a more complete idea of what is going on in art colleges at the moment.‚Äù The final exhibition in this student-led format was staged in 1986 with a catalogue which contained a historical introduction (and post-script), to the exhibition by Andrew Lambirth, New Contemporaries Past and Present. This essay also includes a number of published letters from previous contributors such as RB Kitaj, Bert Irvin, Michael Sandle, Richard Wentworth, and Derek Jarman. Artists who participated in the exhibition during this period include Helen Chadwick, Anish Kapoor (both 1977), Antony Gormley (1978), Mark Wallinger (1981), Peter Doig (1982), Dexter Dalwood (1983), and Catherine Yass (1984).  1988‚Äìpresent  In 1987, the Arts Council of Great Britain commissioned a feasibility report on New Contemporaries to look into the future viability of the exhibition. Published by Richard Shone, who has since become the Chair of a Volunteer Board of Directors, the report proposed a new structure and constitution for the organisation. For the first time, the exhibition was made independent from the art colleges, and supported by professional administration, inviting a panel of selectors each year to pick contributors. The exhibition was relaunched at the ICA in 1989 and toured to four regional centres. From 1989-1994, the exhibition was sponsored by British Telecom and since 2000 has been sponsored by Bloomberg. In 1996, the exhibition was invited to become an component of the Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art and has since been staged in the city every two years. New Contemporaries is also supported by the Arts Council England. During this recent period participants have included Damien Hirst, Glen Brown (both 1989) and Simon Starling (1994).

Lanham ‚Ä¢ Boulder ‚Ä¢ New York ‚Ä¢ London, Rowman & Littlefield, 594p. was proposed in 1997 by anthropologist Jean MichaudMichaud J., 1997, \\"Economic transformation in a Hmong village of Thailand.\\" Human Organization 56(2) : 222-232. to discuss the human societies inhabiting the lands above approximately in the southeastern portion of the Asian landmass, thus not merely in the uplands of conventional Mainland Southeast Asia. It concerns highlands overlapping parts of 10 countries: southwest China, Northeast India, eastern Bangladesh, and all the highlands of Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, and Taiwan. The indigenous population encompassed within these limits numbers approximately 100 million, not counting migrants from surrounding lowland majority groups who came to settle in the highlands over the last few centuries. The notion of the Southeast Asian Massif overlaps geographically with the eastern segment of Van Schendel's notion of Zomia proposed in 2002,Willem van Schendel, 'Geographies of knowing, geographies of ignorance: jumping scale in Southeast Asia', Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 20, 6, 2002, pp. 647‚Äì68. while it overlaps geographically with what political scientist James C. Scott called Zomia in 2009.James C. Scott, The art of not being governed: an anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009. While the notion of Zomia underscores a historical and political understanding of that high region, the Southeast Asia Massif is more appropriately labelled a place or a social space. alt=The Southeast Asian Massif (in red) next to the Himalayan Massif (in yellow)Michaud, J. 2010, Zomia and Beyond. Journal of Global History, 5(2): 205. Location As the notion refers first to peoples and cultures, it is neither realistic nor helpful to define the area precisely in terms of altitude, latitude and longitude, with definite outside limits and set internal subdivisions. Broadly speaking, however, at their maximum extension, these highland groups have historically been scattered over a domain mostly situated above an elevation of about three hundred meters, within an area approximately the size of Western Europe. Stretching from the temperate Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) which roughly demarcates the northern boundary, it moves south to encompass the high ranges extending east and south from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, and the monsoon high country drained by the basins of the lower Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Salween, Chao Phraya, Mekong, Song Hong (Red River), and Zhu Jiang (Pearl River). In China, the Massif includes extreme eastern Tibet, southern and western Sichuan, western Hunan, a small portion of western Guangdong, all of Guizhou and Yunnan, with north and west Guangxi. Spilling over the Southeast Asian peninsula, it covers most of the border areas of Burma with adjacent segments of northeastern India (Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland with portions of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam) and southeastern Bangladesh, the north and west of Thailand, all of Laos above the Mekong valley, borderlands in northern and central Vietnam along the Annam Cordillera, and the northeastern fringes of Cambodia. Beyond the northern limit of the Massif, the Chongqing basin is not included because it has been colonised by the Han for over one millennium, and the massive influx of population into this fertile rice bowl of China has spilled well into parts of central and western Sichuan above 500 metres. The same observation applies to highlands further north in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. At the southern extreme, highland peninsular Malaysia should be excluded as it is disconnected from the Massif by the Isthmus of Kra, and is intimately associated with the Malay world instead.Hall, A History of Southeast Asia. Tarling, The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia. That said, many of the indigenous highland populations of peninsular Malaysia, the Orang Asli, are Austroasiatic by language, and thus linked to groups in the Massif such as the Wa, the Khmu, the Katu, or the Bahnar. The Tibetan world is not included in the Massif as it has its own logic: a centralized and religiously harmonised core with a long, distinctive political existence that places it in a \\"feudal\\" and imperial category, which the societies historically associated with the Massif have rarely, if ever, developed into.Melvyn C. Goldstein, A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State. Berkeley: U. of California Press, 1989. In this sense, the western limit of the Massif, then, is as much a historical and political one as it is linguistic, cultural, and religious. Again, this should not be seen as clear-cut. Many societies on Tibet's periphery, such as the Khampa, Naxi, Drung or Mosuo in Yunnan, the Lopa in Nepal, or the Bhutia in Sikkim, have switched allegiances repeatedly over the centuries, moving in and out of Lhasa's orbit. Moreover, the Tibeto-Burman language family and Tibetan Buddhism have spilled over the eastern edge of the plateau. Historical, linguistic and cultural factors To further qualify the particularities of the Massif, a series of core factors can be incorporated: history, languages, religion, customary social structures, economies, and political relationships with lowland states. What distinguishes highland societies may exceed what they have in common: a vast ecosystem, a state of marginality, and forms of subordination. The Massif is crossed by six major language families, none of which form a decisive majority. In religious terms, several groups are Animist, others are Buddhist, some are Christian, a good number share Taoist and Confucian values, the Hui are Muslim, while most societies sport a complex syncretism. Throughout history, feuds and frequent hostilities between local groups were evidence of the plurality of cultures.Herman, Amid the Clouds and Mist. Robert D. Jenks, Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou. The Miao Rebellion, 1854-1873. Honolulu (HA), U. of Hawaii Press, 1994. Claudine Lombard-Salmon, Un exemple d‚Äôacculturation chinoise : la province du Guizhou au XVIIIe si√®cle. Paris, Publication de l‚Äô√âcole Fran√ßaise d‚ÄôExtr√™me-Orient, vol. LXXXIV, 1972 . The region has never been united politically, not as an empire, nor as a space shared among a few feuding kingdoms, not even as a zone with harmonised political systems. Forms of distinct customary political organisations, chiefly lineage based versus \\"feudal\\",See Michaud J. , 2016 \\"Seeing the Forest for the Trees: Scale, Magnitude, and Range in the Southeast Asian Massif.\\" Pp. 1-40 in Michaud, Jean; Meenaxi B.

Lanham ‚Ä¢ Boulder ‚Ä¢ New York ‚Ä¢ London: Rowman & Littlefield. have long existed. At the national level today, political regimes in countries sharing the region (democracies, three socialist regimes, one constitutional monarchy, and one military dictatorship) simply magnify this ancient political diversity. Along with other transnational highlands around the Himalayas and around the world, the Southeast Asian Massif is marginal and fragmented in historical, economic, as well as cultural terms. It may thus be seen as lacking the necessary significance in the larger scheme of things to be proposed as a promising area subdivision of Asian studies. However, it is important to rethink country based research when addressing trans-border and marginal societies. Inquiries on the ground throughout the Massif show that these peoples share a sense of being different from the national majorities, a sense of geographical remoteness, and a state of marginality that is connected to political and economic distance from regional seats of power. In cultural terms, these highland societies are like a cultural mosaic with contrasting colours, rather than an integrated picture in harmonized shades ‚Äì what Terry Rambo, talking from a Vietnam perspective, has dubbed \\"a psychedelic nightmare\\".A.T. Rambo, ‚ÄòDevelopment Trends In Vietnam‚Äôs Northern Mountain Region‚Äô, In D. Donovan, A.T.Rambo, J. Fox And Le Trong Cuc (Eds.) Development Trends In Vietnam‚Äôs Northern Mountainous Region. Hanoi: National Political Publishing House, pp.5-52, 1997, p. 8. Yet, when observed from the necessary distance, that mosaic can form a distinctive and significant picture, even if an imprecise one at times. Historically,Lim, Territorial Power Domains. Andrew Walker, The Legend of the Golden Boat Regulation, Trade and Traders in the Borderlands of Laos, Thailand, China and Burma. Honolulu: U. of Hawaii Press, 1999. these highlands have been used by lowland empires as reserves of resources (including slaves), and as buffer spaces between their domains. Zomia Zomia is a geographical term coined in 2002 by historian Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam to refer to the huge mass of mainland Southeast Asia that has historically been beyond the control of governments based in the population centers of the lowlands. It largely overlaps with the geographical extent of the Southeast Asian Massif, although the exact boundaries of Zomia differ among scholars:Michaud 2010 all would include the highlands of north Indochina (north Vietnam and all Laos), Thailand, the Shan Hills of northern Myanmar, and the mountains of Southwest China; some extend the region as far west as Tibet, Northeast India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. These areas share a common elevated, rugged terrain, and have been the home of ethnic minorities that have preserved their local cultures by residing far from state control and influence. Other scholars have used the term to discuss the similar ways that Southeast Asian governments have handled minority groups.Michaud, J. (2009, February). \\"Handling Mountain Minorities in China, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos: From History to Current Concerns.\\" Asian Ethnicity 10: 25‚Äì49. Zomia covers more than over the Southeast Asian Massif and comprises nearly one hundred million marginal people. This large area is inside the fringe of eight states and the entirety of one, stretching across the standard regional designations (South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia). Along with its ecological diversity and its relation to states, it arouses a lot of interest. It stands for an original entity of study, a type of international appellation, and a different way in which to study regions. In 2009, political scientist James ScottJames C. Scott, The art of not being governed argued that there is a unity across the Massif ‚Äì which he calls Zomia ‚Äì regarding political forms of domination and subordination, which bonds the fates of the peoples dwelling there, virtually all of whom had taken refuge there to avoid being integrated into a more powerful state, or even allowing the very appearance of a state-like structure within their own societies. This argument had also been made, in a slightly different manner, by Dutch social scientist Willem van Schendel in 2002.Willem van Schendel, ‚ÄòGeographies of knowing, geographies of ignorance Van Schendel had coined the term Zomia, but its geographic coverage differs significantly from Scott's. Etymology The name is from Zomi, a term for highlander common to several related Tibeto- Burman languages spoken in the India-Bangladesh-Burma border area. James C. Scott Professor James C. Scott of Yale University used the concept of Zomia in his 2009 book The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia to argue that the continuity of the ethnic cultures living there provides a counter-narrative to the traditional story about modernity: namely, that once people are exposed to the conveniences of modern technology and the modern state, they will assimilate. Rather, the tribes in Zomia are conscious refugees from state rule and state-centered economies. From his preface: Scott goes on to add that Zomia is the biggest remaining area of earth whose inhabitants have not been completely absorbed by nation-states, although that time is coming to an end. While Zomia is exceptionally diverse linguistically, the languages spoken in the hills are distinct from those spoken in the plains. Kinship structures, at least formally, also distinguish the hills from the lowlands. Hill societies do produce \\"a surplus\\", but they do not use that surplus to support kings and monks. Distinctions of status and wealth abound in the hills, as in the valleys. The difference is that in the valleys they tend to be enduring, while in the hills they are both unstable and geographically confined.In addition, he maintains that many traits that are viewed in mainstream cultures as \\"primitive\\" or \\"backward\\" and used to denigrate hill peoples are actually adaptations to avoid state incorporation, such as lack of a written language, shifting messianic religious movements, or nomadism. Their presence is absent from most histories, since, as Scott puts it, \\"it is the peasants' job to stay out of the archives.\\" Nonetheless, in reality he sees the relationship between upland and lowland peoples as reciprocal, since upland peoples are essential as a source of trade. Differing perspectives Jean Michaud explains the many dilemmas that arise from the language used to address the group of people residing in Zomia in his Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif. The people of Zomia are often referred to as \\"national minority groups,\\" and Michaud argues that contention arises with each of these words. In regards to the word \\"national,\\" Michaud claims that the peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif are in fact transnational, as many groups span over several countries. According to Michaud, \\"minority\\" is not the legitimate way to label the group either, since the populations are so vast. Michaud even claims that the word \\"group\\" is problematic because of its connotation with community and ‚Äúsocial cohesion‚Äù that not all groups share. In 2010, the Journal of Global History published a special issue, \\"Zomia and Beyond\\". In this issue, contemporary historians of Southeast Asian history respond to Scott's arguments. For example, although Southeast Asian expert Victor Lieberman agrees that the highland people crafted their own social worlds in response to the political and natural environments that they encountered, he also finds Scott's documentation to be very weak, especially its lack of Burmese-language sources, saying that not only does this undermine several of Scott's key arguments, but it brings some of his other theories about Zomia into question. Furthermore, Lieberman argues that Scott is overestimating the importance of manpower as a determinant in military success. While the bulk of Scott's argument rests on the efforts of lowland states to dominate the highlands, Lieberman shows the importance of maritime commerce as an equally contributing factor. Lieberman also says that examples not included in Scott's analysis need to be taken into consideration. Scott firmly believes that the culture took shape as a defensive mechanism, as a reaction to surrounding political and social environments. Lieberman, however, argues that the highland peoples of Borneo/Kalimantan had virtually the same cultural characteristics as the Zomians, such as the proliferation of local languages and swidden cultivation, which were all developed without a lowland predatory state. More recently, Scott's claims have been questioned by Tom Brass.Tom Brass (2012), \\"Scott's 'Zomia,' or a Populist Post-modern History of Nowhere\\", Journal of Contemporary Asia, 42:1, 123‚Äì33 Brass maintains that it is incorrect to characterize upland Southeast Asia as \\"state-repelling\\" \\"zones of refuge/asylum\\" to which people voluntarily migrate. This is, he argues, an idealization consistent with the \\"new\\" populist postmodernism, but not supported by ethnographic evidence. The latter suggests that populations neither choose to migrate to upland areas (but go because they are forced off valley land), nor ‚Äì once there ‚Äì are they beyond the reach of the lowland State. Consequently, they are anything but empowered and safe in such contexts. Edward Stringham and Caleb J. Miles analyzed historical and anthropological evidence from societies in Southeast Asia and concluded that they have avoided states for thousands of years. Stringham further analyzes the institutions used to avoid, repel and prevent would-be states. He further concludes that stateless societies like \\"Zomia\\" have successfully repelled states using location, specific production methods, and cultural resistance to states.

Cochran was born in Carlsbad, California in 1947. He studied child development and European intellectual history at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the late 1960s, where he became interested in alternative farming methods. Cochran began his commercial farming career growing strawberries using conventional methods, but switched to organic farming methods after he was nearly poisoned by pesticides and, as a result of this experience, questioned the effect that the chemicals had on his workers. In 1983, he started Swanton Berry Farm, located North of Santa Cruz, California, in Davenport, California. In 1987, his farm became the first CCOF-certified organic strawberry farm in the State of California. He subsequently developed a wide range of new methods, which include crop rotations, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts, trap crops such as mustard and alfalfa, and the use of natural predators, to control strawberry specific pests and diseases. His mostly intuitively developed methods were later verified scientifically in a series of studies by University of California, Davis plant pathologist Krishna Subbarao and his collaborators. Cochran originally found it difficult to get funding for his experiments from the California Strawberry Commission, stating that \\"The industry blockaded our efforts to get money to research alternatives, and spent a lot of money in Washington making sure our proposals didn't get funded.\\" Cochran's methods have been credited for making a large-scale commercial organic strawberry industry possible in California. Cochran was also the first, and still one of the few, California organic farmers to have a contract with the United Farm Workers.

An early lord of the manor was Nicholas de Sarnesfield, a member of the retinue of the Black Prince and created a Knight of the Garter in 1386 by King Richard II to whom he was standard bearer and an eminent diplomat. He died in 1394, leaving his two daughters co-heiresses, the eldest of whom married Hugh de Moynton or Monington. The younger daughter married Walter Bromwich of Sarnesfield Coffyn, now Little Sarnesfield Farm. The manor was split into two moieties, with Greater Sarnesfield passing to the Monington family, and Sarnesfield Coffyn (also known as Little Sarnesfield) to Bromwich. The latter was held by John Bromwich in 1532. Subsequently the two moieties seem to have been re-united into one manor. Sarnesfield was held by the Monington family until 1781.

In 1837 Thomas Monington of Sarnesfield was High Sheriff of Herefordshire. Marshall In 1891 Sarnesfield Court was bought by George William Marshall (1839‚Äì1905), York Herald, who did much to restore the church to its original condition, removing later additions. He was buried in the parish on 16 Sept. 1905. St Mary's Church Fragments of 13th- or 14th-century floriated crosses are visible in the church. One apparently from the 14th century in the south-east corner of the south chapel commemorates Isabel De Sarnesfield. Sarnesfield Court Sarnesfield Court was demolished in 1955.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmoreland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History It is possible that the oldest existing part of the church, the lower part of the tower, dates from the Anglo-Saxon era. The south aisle was added in about 1200, and the chancel was extended during the 13th century. In the following century the Beetham chapel was added, the south aisle was widened in the 15th century, and in the 16th century the top stage of the tower was built. In the 1870s the church was restored and a south porch was added. In the Buildings of England series, Hyde and Pevsner state that this was carried out by Joseph Bintley, whereas Price attributes it to the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in rubble, mainly limestone, with sandstone dressings. It is roofed in lead. The plan is rectangular, incorporating a nave and chancel with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a north vestry and a south chapel. The church also has a south porch, and a west tower in two stages. The lower stage of the tower contains a west doorway dating from the 14th century, above which is a two-light window. The upper stage is slightly corbelled-out and contains three-light bell openings. At the top is a battlemented parapet with crocketted pinnacles and a 20th-century weathervane. At the east end of the church, the chancel has a 19th-century five-light window, and both aisles contain a 15th-century three-light window. At the west end is a 15th-century three-light window to the left of the tower, and a late 14th-century two-light window to the right. On the south side of the church is a gabled porch, and two- or three-light windows. On the north side is a doorway and five 15th- century three-light windows. All the windows are in Perpendicular style. Interior The south arcade is in Norman style with cylindrical piers and round arches. The north arcade dates from the 15th century, with octagonal piers and pointed arches. The octagonal font cover dates from 1636. Most of the other furnishings date from the 19th and 20th centuries. The south window in the southeast chapel contains fragments of medieval and 17th-century stained glass. These were re-set in the 1870s by Frederick Burrow, who also worked on other windows. The east window dates from 1881 and is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Some of the windows in the nave were designed by Shrigley and Hunt. The oldest monument is in the southeast chapel, a tomb with effigies dating from about 1490, which was damaged in 1647. External features In the churchyard is a war memorial to the First World War, consisting of a sandstone Celtic-style cross standing on sandstone steps, and surrounded by limestone walls. A plaque has been added to commemorate the Second World War. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building.

The album was originally planned to be released on September 13, 2011, then September 20, 2011, but it was finally released on September 27, 2011. The fourteen-track standard edition does not include any new material, although it is the first time \\"The History of Everything (Theme from The Big Bang Theory)\\" appears on an album. This is the second greatest hits compilation from Barenaked Ladies, after 2001's Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991‚Äì2001). The album was released by Rhino Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group which is also the parent company of Reprise Records. Reprise was Barenaked Ladies' record label from their first album, Gordon in 1992, through Everything to Everyone in 2003. Eleven of the fourteen tracks on the album are thus from the Warner Music catalogue. Album contents The album compiles singles which were released in the US between 1997 and 2010; although \\"If I Had $1000000\\" was initially released on Gordon in 1992, the song was not a successful US single until 1997. One non-album single is included; \\"The Big Bang Theory Theme\\". The album contains nine songs previously included on Disc One, four songs from three of the band's albums released in the ten years since that release (Everything to Everyone, Barenaked Ladies Are Me, and All in Good Time), and the non-album \\"The Big Bang Theory Theme\\". No tracks from holiday-themed Barenaked for the Holidays or the children's album Snacktime! are included. Steven Page is the lead vocalist on five of the fourteen tracks included on the standard album, and co-lead with Ed Robertson on three others. Since Page's 2009 departure from the band, they have continued to perform all of the songs on the album (with another member performing Page's vocals) except for \\"Call and Answer\\". Royalty lawsuit In September 2015, TMZ discovered court documents filed by Steven Page over \\"The History of Everything (Theme from The Big Bang Theory)\\" Page alleged that he was promised 20 percent of the proceeds from the song, which includes revenue generated from this album, claiming former bandmate Ed Robertson kept that money for himself. Reception The album received mixed to positive reviews. Fans criticized the album for not including more recent singles, and the fact that 9 out of the 14 songs were already included on Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991‚Äì2001).

was a master mariner prominent during 1822‚Äì1835 in the seas around the colony of New South Wales, New Zealand and the Society Islands (now part of Tahiti). Dibbs was master of the colonial schooner Endeavour 1822‚Äì1824, the brig Haweis 1824‚Äì1827 and the barque Lady Blackwood 1827‚Äì1834. He is credited as the European discoverer of Rarotonga and several other islands.http://www.findingnz.co.nz Other islands are Mitiero and Mauke. Most of his voyages involved the transporting of missionaries, trade, whaling and seal hunting. He was believed for over 170 years to have disappeared at sea in 1835. He was the father of Sir George Dibbs, a pre- Federation Australian politician, Sir Thomas Dibbs, an Australian banker, and John Campbell Dibbs, a successful Sydney businessman.  Early years  Very few verifiable facts are known. John was bornRegister of St Andrews baptisms 1739‚Äì1803. John Dibbs was born in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland on 8 November 1790 to John Dibbs (Shoemaker in St Andrews) and Elizabeth Simpson and Baptised on 14 November by Dr Adamson. Witnesses were James Greig and Thomas Aikman. and educated in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. His parents were John Dibbs and Elizabeth Simpson and John was one of several children. His father, uncle and grandfather did military service prior to his birth in 1790.  Maritime training  It is very likely he trained as a midshipman through the Marine Society around 1806. The East India Company College (Hertford Heath, near Hertford) started in 1806, and trained 16- to 18-year-olds, and if so John would have been one of the earliest intakes of students. He would have graduated to the East India Company Maritime Service in 1808. His activities 1808‚Äì1818 are unknown, but there are two general possibilities. In 1808 at age 18 he graduates and becomes eligible for posting as a midshipman. Reportedly 25% of Scottish males served in the military between 1792 and 1815, so it is possible (given his father's and grandfather's military service) that John joined the Royal Navy that was then involved with the War of 1812 and Napoleonic Wars. After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at Waterloo the British economy went into recession, and there were thousands of ex-navy seamen out of work. There is however no record of a Lieutenant Dibbs (or variant spellings) in the Royal Navy.Navy List, site containing over 11,000 names of commissioned Royal Navy officers during the Napoleonic Wars (1793‚Äì1815) The idea that John Dibbs was in the Royal Navy comes from a story first published in 1865'The Leisure Hour' magazine, 1865, reprinted in the Religious Tract Societypublication, undated, but believed to be about 1885, and elsewhere, https://archive.org/details/adventuresashore00reliiala. The vessel is named as the Lady Mary, but this would appear to be the Lady Blackwood as this is the ship Captain John sailed back to England in 1829. If so, this is written by a child passenger on the Lady Blackwood, and is in all likelihood much embellished with the retelling many years later, hence the wrong ship name and other details. The Lady Blackwood returned to Sydney in March 1830, and yet there is no mention of this pirate adventure reported in the Sydney Gazette, nor in a letter dated 18 March 1830 (original in the Mitchell Library, Sydney) by Mrs. Sophia Dibbs to a friend. detailing an 1828 voyage to England in a ship, the Lady Mary, under the command of a Captain Dibbs, a former Royal Navy lieutenant, and how he outwitted pirates off the coast of Brazil. Merchant Marine officer grade promotions usually required a two-year tour at sea. Hence it is reasonable to assume that ... * John graduated from midshipman to 6th officer about 1810. * John is promoted to 5th officer about 1812. * John is promoted to 4th officer about 1814. * John is promoted to 3rd officer about 1816. Scottish immigration to Canada peaked in 1819.\\"The Scottish Pioneers of Upper Canada, 1784‚Äì1855\\", Lucille H. Campey (2005) . p.153-155 Glengarry and Beyond John is listed as the master of the Rothiemurchus, a ship rated at 322 tons owned by John Watson & Co, Leith, in March 1818. The Rothiemurchus made trips to Quebec in 1816 and 1817 (John was probably 1st officer), again in March 1818, and was wrecked in September 1818Caledonian Mercury 10 October 1818: \\"The Rothiemurchus, Dibbs, of and from Leith to Petersburgh, was driven on shore on Gothland 15th ult. and it was feared would not be got off. The materials, &c.; expected to be saved.\\" in the Baltic on her way in ballast to St. Petersburgh, after leaving Leith on 3 September 1818. She ended up on the Naas Reef, near Wisby, Gotland, when \\"driven on shore\\" on 15 September. The vessel last appeared in the Lloyd's Registers in 1818, but she does not feature between 1812 and 1815, and part of the explanation is that this was not the name under which she originally sailed. Previously launched and known as The Bell of London, she was evidently owned by the Admiralty as a supply vessel or transport but she was advertised as up for sale prior to the Congress of Vienna and Wellington's subsequent campaign in Europe.Caledonian Mercury, 5 March 1815 there appears the following: \\"By Authority of the Right Honourable the Judge of The High Court of Admiralty. On Wednesday the 22d day of March 1815, there is to be exposed to public roup [auction] and sale, before the said Judge, at Edinburgh, within the Ordinary Court place, at two o'clock afternoon, The Ship or Vessel sometime called THE BELL OF LONDON, now the ROTHIEMURCHUS, With her haill [whole] furniture and apparelling, conform to inventory, as presently lying in the harbour of Cromarty, which ship was built at Kingston Port, in Elgin, and launched in the year 1812, and admeasures per register 315 30‚Äì94th tons, and is then to be set up at the sum of L.4200 14s. 3d. Sterling. The conditions of sale, and inventory of the said Ship or Vessel, together with the certificate of registry, are to be seen at the Admiralty Office, Parliament Square, or in the hands of Mr John Peat, one of the Procurators of Court, any awful [sic] day betwixt and the time of sale.\\" This sale did not result in a buyer, and \\"the Rothiemurchus of London\\" was re-advertised as for sale in Edinburgh on 18 October 1815, and was now \\"presently lying in the harbour of Leith\\", although her former name was no longer mentioned. This time she was \\"set up at the sum of three thousand pounds Sterling\\", presumably the reserve price. Again she did not sell, and was again advertised for sale on 8 November, this time set up at ¬£2500. By 26 February 1816 \\"the New Ship Rothiemurchus\\" had indeed found a new master, George Watson, and was advertised as ready to receive goods, and bound for Quebec in early April. John joined the in Leith, Scotland, as 2nd officer in 1820. The Westmoreland (Captain Potton) transported immigrants and cargo from Leith to South Africa, then to Sydney via Hobart, the Bay of Islands in New Zealand and Tahiti. She was one of 26 immigrant ships that embarked some 4000 persons under the Albany Settlement Scheme of 1820,http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=timothy-johns- the-1820-settlement-scheme-to-south-africa\\\\ describes in detail the concept, organization, pitfalls and results of this scheme. the aim being to settle them in South Africa. On the Westmoreland were Rev. Thomas Kendall, the Maori chieftains Waitkato and Hongi Hika, to whom King George IV had gifted a suit of armour. While in England Hongi Hika had also negotiated a large quantity of muskets and ammunition for land from the French adventurer Baron Charles de Thierry who shipped them to Sydney. These munitions fundamentally changed the balance of power in Maori New Zealand. Waitkato and Hongi Hika and their armaments were landed in New Zealand in July 1821, and the Westmoreland continued north east to Tahiti for extra cargo and passengers (notably Rev. John Williams, before heading to Sydney.  Arrival in New South Wales  On his arrival in Sydney in 1821 on the Westmoreland Captain Dibbs became acquainted with Robert Campbell Sr. (of the Sydney traders Campbell & Co), his sons, John (20), Robert (18) and Rev. John Williams of the London Missionary Society (LMS) on the incoming voyage from Otaheite (Tahiti) and New Zealand in 1821. Robert Campbell Sr. and Rev. Williams offered him command of the schooner Endeavour to trade in the Tahiti region. During this time, while ferring Rev. Williams around the islands, John became acquainted with Ren√© Primev√®re Lesson and Jules de Blosseville of the French royal corvette Coquille, on a hydographic expedition. In May 1823, John and Jules de Blosseville, on the Endeavour returned to Maupiti Island to map it for the Coquille expedition. On 25 July 1823, Captain Dibbs (re)discovered Armstrong Island (now called Rarotonga), and nearby islands Mitiero and Mauke. In March 1824, the Russian Hydrographic Service mission under Otto von Kotzebue stayed in Otaheite for 10 days, and met with Captain Dibbs.In \\"A New Voyage Round the World in the Years 1823, 24, 25, and 26. Vol. 1\\" https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25693/ he mentions \\"...the ship possessed by the Queen. This is commanded by an Englishman, and a part of the crew is also English. It was just returned from a voyage among the Society Islands, where it had been to collect tribute, and was preparing to carry a cargo of cocoa- oil, stowed in thick bamboo-canes, to Port Jackson. From the Captain, who visited me, I gained much information concerning the present state of affairs in these seas.\\". This is of course Captain Dibbs and the Endeavour. The rest of the crew were Tahitians. Captain Dibbs was also present in Otahiete for the coronation of King Pomare III on 21 April 1824, before heading to Sydney with cargo and a group of missionaries, notably George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman. On 16 July 1824 on the voyage to Sydney from Tahiti, the crew and passengers stopped in Whangaroa Harbour, near where a Wesleyan mission was located at Kaeo. An altercation with the local Maori NgƒÅti Pou tribe resulted in an incident where Maori warriors took control of the Endeavour and menaced the crew. The situation was defused by the timely arrival of another Maori chieftain, NgƒÅti Uru chief Te Ara. The incident was initially described by Rev. Tyerman as a mostly a problem of cultural differences, but in later years the story became a perilous cannibal adventure that defined the Maori (to European readers) as barbarian savages. The Endeavour finally returned to Sydney in mid August 1824.All shipping dates can be found in the on-line archives of the Sydney Gazette and other colonial newspapers of the time. See http://trove.nla.gov.au. This on-line resource has been invaluable in piecing together John‚Äôs history during 1820‚Äì1835, mostly by locating Shipping News references to the Westmoreland, Endeavour, Haweis and Lady Blackwood, and their various captains, placing them in a time line, and drawing inferences and conclusions. Captain Dibbs was appointed the London Missionary Society Master of Ships for the Pacific station and served in this capacity until 1827. In March 1825, he was given command of the Campbell & Co brig Haweis (from Capt Jamison) and ferried missionaries around New Zealand and Tahiti, and also traded, until mid-1827. The Haweis made a voyage to Mauritius (off the east coast of Africa) in early 1827 ‚Äì April 1827, selling the cargo of sugar in Hobart on the return voyage. The vessel appears to have been under the command of the 1st officer, a Mr. Doyle, as John was still in Otaheite, and rejoined the Haweis in Hobart. In June 1827, in Launceston on the return voyage from Hobart to Sydney, John assaulted a river pilot, one John Williams, who filed a formal complaint. In the court document it is stated that the Haweis had a crew of Tahitians, and John was fluent enough in their language to be able to command them. The court document ends by stating that the accused was \\"not apprehended, effected his escape\\". The Lady Blackwood scudding through the Bay of Biscay. Painting by George Gregory, 1892. In 1821 Campbell & Co had acquired the barque Lady Blackwood in Calcutta. Captain John handed the Haweis over to Capt John James around September 1827, and on 29 September, departed for Calcutta to take command of the Lady Blackwood. He arrived in Calcutta from Singapore on the Donna Carmelita, listed as on Country Service (i.e. as an East India company employee), and returned to Sydney in mid April 1828. His first trading voyage in the Lady Blackwood was to Valparaiso, Chile, May‚ÄìNovember 1828, returning with a cargo of wheat, barley, other grains and some breeding mares.  Marriages  The London Missionary Society recordsUnpublished Dibbs family letter, 1974, referring to LMS Archives in Raiatea. The original LMS source is yet to be relocated. LMS archives are found at http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/collections/missionary-collections/ but much is not as yet on line. Same document mentions an older relative stating that Sophia told him Captain John was a widower, and that he may have been married about 1815, and had two sons, James and John. that at Raiatea (now Tahiti), \\"25 Aug 1825, Mary, wife of John Dibbys, Master schooner Haweis, died in childbirth.\\" There is no other known information on Mary, but it is most probable that she was from Sydney or New Zealand, and they would have been married by mid-1824. She may have been the daughter of an LMS missionary,Journal and proceedings ‚Äì Royal Australian Historical Society, Volumes 9‚Äì10, (1924) p216ff. This article discusses the voyage of Ren√© Primev√®re Lesson as described in Voyage autour du monde sur la Coquille published in 1838. Lesson met M. Deps, the master of the schooner Endeavour. M. Deps is of course Capt. Dibbs. Lesson also recounts a May 1823 meeting between himself, Capt. Dibbs, and Rev. William Pascoe Crook and his daughters aged 20 and 16. http://colonialfamilies.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/family- stories-the-crooks-of-tahiti/ lists their names as Mary and Nancy Anna. states that Rev. Samuel Marsden married Mary Crook to Johann Christian Simon Handt at St.James Church, Sydney in 1832. So she can‚Äôt be the Mary who died in 1825.Another possibility was Mary Cover Hassall (1799‚Äì1825). Her father and brother were closely involved with Robert and John Campbell and the LMS, and ran a business provisioning LMS missionaries to Otaheite. She was born and raised in Sydney. Hassall family records indicate she married Rev. Walter Lawry on 22 November 1819, and spent the next four years in Tonga. The Lawry's returned to Cornwall and Mary died soon after giving birth to a daughter in 1825. as John transported many of them with families around the region. Shipping records indicate that the Haweis was on a return voyage to Sydney from Tahiti in August 1825. In December 1828 John married Sophia Allwright (19) the daughter of convicts Thomas Allwright and Sophia Langford, in Sydney, and took her back to St. Andrews in early 1829 on the Lady Blackwood. A son, John (the most likely name), was born prematurely soon after arrival in London in August 1829 but died after 6 hours.Letter by Mrs. Sophia Dibbs to a friend, dated 18 March 1830, on her return to Sydney from Scotland. Original held in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. They had three other sons, John Campbell (born 1830), Thomas Allwright (born 1833) and George Richard (born 1834), all who became prominent in the colony before federation. An unnamed daughter (born 1832) is believed to have died soon after birth as no baptismal record is extant.  \\"Disappearance at Sea\\", and the real story  For generations, it was thought and always said by the family that Captain John Dibbs disappeared at sea in 1835, and was never heard of again. It was only in 2009 that part of the true story finally emerged when records from the HEIC archives were located in London. Examination of shipping records between 1829 and 1833 show that John was engaged mostly in the seal and whaling trade in the Lady Blackwood. During his last voyage, something happened which caused major personality changes and he was diagnosed with \\"mania furiosa\\", with symptoms of uncontrollable rages. The most likely cause is a severe head injury, such as a depressed skull fracture. He and Sophia lived apart for a few months, and then when his condition became unmanageable, the East India Company (through the assistance of John Campbell) arranged for him to be transferred to the company asylum in Calcutta run by Dr. Isaac Beardsmore, then later to another facility in London. Aug 1835 Capt John departs for Calcutta aboard the Africaine, restrained in his cabin. He appears to have been accompanied or escorted by a Captain Carew. Nov 1837 John is shipped to England aboard the Catherine at a cost of Rs. 600. He was reportedly so uncontrollable that he had to be placed in a straight jacket. The 1841 census in England lists John Dibbs, born in Scotland around 1790, in an East India Company Asylum, Pembroke House, in London. He was described as a naval officer. John Dibbs and his wife Elizabeth Simpson had a son John who was baptised on 14 November 1790 in St Andrews and St Leonards, Scotland, for whom no other records have been found. East India Company recordsBritish Library: IOR/K/2/34, IOR/K/2/1, IOR/L/MIL/5/423 show John Dibbs, a ship‚Äôs captain, as a patient in the lunatic Asylum of Isaac Beardsmore in Calcutta, India in 1835. He was diagnosed with 'mania furiosa'. After many letters to the Governor of Bengal,British Library: IOR/V/27/750/16 a passage to London was arranged in June 1837 on the Catherine. It was hoped that the better climate there would effect an improvement in his health. His former place of abode was 'unknown' but he himself stated that he was born in St Andrews, Scotland, that his father was a grocer and alive in 1829 and that his wife and children were in Sydney, where he had property. After a year, in 1838, he had not improved and was described as 'haughty and sullen' and 'unwilling to take treatment'. His main occupations were reading and walking and religious attendance. He was in otherwise good health. Details of the diet of the patients are given for each day of the week. Breakfast was always one pint of milk and five ounces of thick round bread. For dinner there was typically half a pound of meat such as mutton, with potatoes or barley broth, five ounces of bread, a pudding like rice pudding and one and a half pints of beer. There were carrots on Thursday, specially mentioned. There was always a teatime serving of one pint of tea and a thick round of bread and butter. For supper there was bread and cheese and beer for those who liked it. John must have thrived, at least physically as he spent the next 37 years in the care of the East India Company, moving with them to their new Royal India Asylum in Ealing, London. He died aged 81 in 1872. His death certificate states that he had dementia for 37 years, an enlarged prostate and the cause of death seems to have been urania poisoning. John Dibbs was buried from the Royal India Asylum, Ealing, in the South Ealing Cemetery.Formerly the Ealing and Old Brentford Cemetery, grave 15, row G, block C  Captain Dibbs' ships  Schooner Endeavour, about 50 tons, crew 8‚Äì11. One of the first ships built in Sydney, in 1804 by James Underwood. It was first used for trading between Port Jackson New Zealand and Tahiti, and was gifted by the London Missionary Society to Tamatoa, King of Raiatea. In 1812, the master was Captain Theodore Walker.The Journal of the Polynesian Society, Volume 71 1962 > Volume 71, No. 1 > Rarotongan sandalwood: The visit of Goodenough to Rarotonga in 1814, by H. E. Maude and Marjorie Tuainekore Crocombe, p 32-56 In 1822 it was sold to Rev. John Williams, who after getting into financial difficulties sold it in 1824 to John Campbell of Campbell and Co. In the Sydney Gazette 6 February 1823, Robert Brimer (1st), William Wood, Francisco Preto and seven Tahitians are listed as crew. On 29 January 1824, Robert Brimer, John Smith, Francisco Preto and four Tahitians are listed as crew. Captain Dibbs remained as master till September 1824, when he took command of the Haweis. Robert Brimer, the 1st Officer, took command of the Endeavour. Schooner/brig Haweis 72 tons, crew 6‚Äì8. Seems to have had a cargo capacity of around 45 tons. The 72-ton, wooden schooner / brig Haweis was built at Moorea, Society Islands (Tahiti) for the London Missionary Society by the missionaries George Bignall and John Williams. The vessel was launched in December 1817 by King Pomare II of Tahiti and named after Dr. Thomas Haweis, whose interests led to the founding of the London Missionary Society. The Haweis proved to be unsuitable for the intended use, being to trade and procure supplies for both the Tahitian and New Zealand missions. In November 1828 Haweis departed Sydney for Antipodes and Bounty Islands, where a sealing gang was left. Gangs were often stationed on remote islands to cull as many seals as they could before the ships returned. Sealing was dangerous enough, but added to it was the very distinct possibility that their ship might never return. Sealers were crushed to death by seals, attacked, killed and eaten by Maori, and abandoned to starve by captains that couldn't, or didn't, return. After Haweis left her gang in the southern islands, she continued her voyage trading around New Zealand and called at the Bay of Islands in December to refresh. While at the Bay of Islands an interpreter was enlisted to assist in trading with Maori. They then sailed for the East Cape. In March 1828 the Haweis was attacked and looted at Whakatane, in the Bay of Plenty, with three crewmen killed. The ship was retaken a couple of days later by Captain Clarke of the New Zealander, and Haweis arrived back at the Bay of Islands after her harrowing ordeal on 15 March. Haweis sealing gang must have been more fortunate that others, as when the brig arrived back in Sydney in April, seal skins were among her cargo. This success saw Haweis sail to the sealing grounds in the south again the following month and when she arrived back in Sydney on 29 June from Stewart Island, her crew had taken another 340 seal skins. Haweis next voyage was an eight-day return trip from Sydney to Newcastle, still under Captain John James. On 24 October 1829 James left Sydney on Haweis, bound for the Society Islands. By the following January grave fears were held for her safety. In 1835, a report appeared that the Haweis has been taken over by escaping convicts, and the crew and passengers murdered.Sydney Herald 25 August 1835 Sydney Herald 25 August 1835: \\"After the brig had got fairly out to sea they came from their various places of concealment in the vessel, murdered the captain and the passengers and all those of the crew who would not join them in taking the vessel. They reached the Navigators and ran the vessel on one of the islands and broke her up. Since then the murderers have been living on the same island. Capt Charlton sent over by the first conveyance dispatches to this effect to the Admiral on the South American coast. When we reflect upon the number of vessels that are continually being missed from the port of Sydney we cannot but infer that many of them have no doubt followed the fate of the Haweis and the unfortunate passengers and crew.\\" Barque \\"Lady Blackwood\\" Built at Fort Gloucester, Bengal, 1821, 253 tons. Hull and planks made of teak. Length 92 feet, beam 26 feet. Two decks, three masts. Crew : 12‚Äì15 Rowan Hackman in \\"Ships of the East India Company\\" lists a LADY BLACKWOOD, 263 tons burden, built at Calcutta in 1821 for Cockerill & Co. She was licensed by the HEIC under the system which existed after the Company lost its monopoly of trade to India in 1813. The first master was Captain Hall (of Blackheath, Kent), and on the first voyage was jury rigged (after being dismasted in a typhoon) from Philippine Islands to Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) to coast of northern California where the Russian American Fur Company had a station and made sufficient repairs for her to proceed to Mexico. That's a journey of 6,000/10,000 miles without masts or rigging. In August 1822, the Lady Blackwood (Capt Russell) arrived from Mexico and Singapore. The Lady Blackwood was acquired by Campbell and Co. in 1827, and Capt Dibbs departed Sydney for Calcutta, 29 September 1827 to take command from a Captain Lamb. The Lady Blackwood was sold in 1849 to San Francisco interests, sold again by the US Marshal in 1858 for $1700, and wrecked off the coast of British Columbia about 1872. The ship's bell was recovered a few years later and is now in a Church in Comox BC.

It tells of an actor in a Far West village who acts against bikers who held up the village's bar, and the actions that followed. Plot John Gray (Sean Patrick Flanery) is an actor in a Far West time touristic attraction village, named Profit, near a small town. He lives an eventless life, with his on-and-off girlfriend Sharon (Tanya Allen) his friends and co-workers Tim (Tyler Labine and Pablo (Alonso Oyarzun), and his mentor Gus (Robert Forster). Until one night, when two bikers rob the town's bar and severely beat the barman down. After they left, John decides to call the police, against the advice of the thugs' leader, Bart (Lou Diamond Phillips). No one else present in the bar volunteers to help the police for fear of revenge. The next day at the village, John sees the two goons walking down the street and makes a citizen's arrest. They are then taken by the Sheriff who locks them in a cell. He allows Bart to make a phone call, allowing him to call upon the rest of the gang. The other bikers arrive to the town and kills the sheriff and his deputy, in order to free Bart from his cell. As the night comes, John comes back to his place after dropping Sharon at her house when the gang starts shooting him in his car. He escapes and goes to Gus' isolated trailer and asks for help. A shooting occurs between the two and the bikers. All but two of the thugs are shot : one of them escapes and warns the others, and Bart is captures and put in the trunk of John's pick-up truck. They then go to the police station only to find the two bodies. Understanding the situation they are in, they split. Gus goes to town to phone the police, only to find that all the lines are dead. Meanwhile, John takes Bart inside a mine, ties him up to a shaft and waits for the authorities. While trying to drive out of town to get access to a working telephone, Gus gets trapped by the gang. They take him to the police station and starts torturing him to know where John and Bart are. Silent at first, he starts to talk when the new leader, King (Hugh Dillon) threaten to harm Sharon. Gus leads a group of four thugs on the way to the mine, when they are taken in an ambush by John. All of the goons die while Gus is shot in the leg. At the same time, the other inhabitants of Profit are rounded up in a large cell in the fake police station of the Far West village. John comes back to the Far West village to negotiate with King an exchange between Bart and Sharon. While the deal takes place, and John and Sharon escape in the pick-up truck, Gus kills the few bikers who kept an eye on the villagers and frees everybody. When he asks for volunteers to fight when the others come back, only Tim and Pablo reluctantly agree. The rest of the gang comes back and a shootout occurs, culminating with a duel between John and Bart, during which John shoots Bart in the arm, disabling him. Some time after that, the Far West village still runs with some new additions : John's story is loosely adapted as an Old West tale and acted out for tourists.

McMurphy) is the protagonist of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962). He appears in the stage and film adaptations of the novel as well. Jack Nicholson portrayed Randle Patrick McMurphy in the film adaption, earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was nominated on the \\"Heroes\\" list of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, but did not make the final list. In 2019 he was ranked by film magazine Empire as the 99th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. Fictional character biography Randle Patrick McMurphy is an Irish American brawler found guilty of battery, gambling and statutory rape. He is a Korean War veteran who was a POW during the war and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for leading a breakout from a Chinese camp, but was dishonorably discharged for insubordination. He is sentenced to a fairly short prison term and decides to have himself declared insane in order to be transferred to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his time in comparative comfort and luxury. McMurphy's ward in the mental institution is run by the tyrannical Nurse Ratched, who has cowed the patients into submission. McMurphy makes it his mission to flout Ratched's regime of rules and punishment and to liberate the other patients from her grip. During his short stay at the hospital, McMurphy forms deep friendships with two of his fellow patients: Billy Bibbit, a manchild who has a stutter, whom Ratched has dominated into a suicidal mess; and Chief Bromden, a selectively mute Native American. In the former, McMurphy sees a younger brother figure whom he wants to teach to have fun, while the latter is his only real confidant. McMurphy becomes ensnared in a number of power-games with Nurse Ratched. He ends up as the clear winner, reminding the other patients how to enjoy life and stand up for themselves, and persuading them to act out against Ratched's bullying. Ratched unsuccessfully tries to break his spirit through repeated shock therapy treatments. In the novel's climax, McMurphy sneaks two prostitutes into the ward to take Billy's virginity, while he and the others throw a party. Ratched catches them and threatens to tell Billy's mother‚Äîthe only woman he fears more than her‚Äîwhich terrifies him so much that he commits suicide by slitting his throat. Enraged, McMurphy sexually assaults her by ripping her shirt open and chokes her nearly to death, but is knocked unconscious by one of the hospital's orderlies. For this, Ratched has McMurphy lobotomized, which is to be seen as a kind of castration: \\"If she [Ratched] can‚Äôt cut below the belt she‚Äôll do it above the eyes\\". Chief Bromden, seeing what Ratched has done to McMurphy, smothers him with a pillow in an act of euthanasia, and then breaks a window to flee from the asylum, fulfilling McMurphy's wish for him to be free. Nurse Ratched, meanwhile, has been rendered unable to speak after McMurphy's assault, breaking her hold over her patients. Critical response Richard Gray considers McMurphy \\"swaggering, bold, and with an incorrigible sense of humor\\" and an \\"authentic Irish rebel ... who offers the inmates the example and chance of independence.\\" Further, Glen O. Gabbard and Krin Gabbard, the authors of Psychiatry and the Cinema, write that McMurphy \\"becomes a Christ figure for whom shock therapy is the crown of thorns and lobotomy the cross\\". McMurphy's domination of Ratched is described as a heroic sacrifice, for the redemption and freedom of the men of the ward. When Ratched returns to the ward following the attack, she is bruised and fearful, and no longer has the same measure of control over her patients due to McMurphy exposing her vulnerabilities.

In 1996, he successfully prosecuted the first case in American history against a chemical company for causing a birth defect. The following year, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice named Ferraro a finalist for Trial Lawyer of the Year, for his work on the landmark case. In 2017, he wrote a book about his experience with the case titled Blindsided. The book became a bestseller the same year, appearing on the USA Today, Los Angeles Times, and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists. Legal career After graduating from law school in 1983, Ferraro worked briefly for a civil litigation defense firm. On May 13, 1985, he opened his own mass tort litigation practice, The Ferraro Law Firm, where he began working to represent blue-collar workers such as workers that had been exposed to asbestos. By 1990 his firm was representing thousands of blue- collar workers. On June 15, 1997, he opened a second law firm, Kelley & Ferraro, along with Michael V. Kelley in Cleveland, Ohio. The two firms combined have handled over 50,000 asbestos cases, as well as nationwide environmental toxic tort cases. Litigation with widow of partner Lynn Arko Kelley, the widow of Ferraro's partner, sued him for $3.5 billion. Little is known about the case due to a gag order imposed by the court. Dupont case In 1996 Ferraro successfully went to trial against DuPont in what was the first case ever prosecuted against a chemical company for causing a birth defect. Seven years later, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the verdict. Book In 2017, Ferraro released a book, Blindsided: The True Story of One Man's Crusade Against Chemical Giant DuPont for a Boy with No Eyes (Gildan Media). The book discusses the decade long courtroom battle waged in Florida to help bring justice and hope to the family of the young boy born with no eyes.\\"Q&A;: Jim Ferraro Talks His New Book on Groundbreaking Birth Defect Trial\\" Daily Business Review.

From left to right, Juan Pablo Ballester, Ileana Villaz√≥n, Marcia Leiseca (President of the Council of Visual Arts), Jos√© Toirac and Tanya Angulo, 1989 From left to right, Jos√© Toirac, Ileana Villaz√≥n and Juan Pablo Ballester in the The Smile of Truth piece, Homage to Hans Haacke, Castle of The Real Force, Havana, Cuba, 1989 Grupo ABTV (ABTV Group) was the name given to the artistic collaboration between Cuban artists Tanya Angulo (1968), Juan Ballester Carmenates (1966), Jos√© Toirac (1966) and Ileana Villaz√≥n (1969) by the Uruguayan artist and critic Luis Camnitzer.  The beginning of the Group  Camnitzer created the acronym with the surnames of its members during his research on Cuban art that he would later publish as New Art of Cuba. In his book Camnitzer refers to ABTV work as ‚Äúpossibly the most rigorous group in Cuba today (‚Ä¶) Though they occasionally produce individual work, the group as such applies itself to appropriating other artists‚Äô work to make theoretical criticism about culture and society. The team started with Ballester and Villaz√≥n, with Toirac joining a little later, and them Angulo. By 1989 they decided to split up again, although temporarily. They regrouped in 1991. Ballester and Villaz√≥n set the direction of the group with a team project realized while they were studying in the ISA‚Äù. Juan Ballester Carmenates and Ileana Villaz√≥n used quotation and Appropriation (art) as a creative procedure as well as the use of curatorship as a critical structure in their exhibition El que imita fracasa (He Who Imitates Fails) that they presented in 1988 at Galer√≠a L in Havana. The artist Ballester and Villaz√≥n acted as curators of their exhibition He Who Imitates Fails while at the same time dividing themselves into many other successful Cuban artists while inventing their new work, appropriating their formal solutions to polemicize the contents, thematic and stylistic, of the parodied artists. The exhibition worked ‚Äúas a critic, bringing to the fore the stylistic miseries of appropriation. The works magnified those telltale effects of a constant search for prestige in the use and abuse of metropolitan models‚Äù. Ballester and Villaz√≥n questioned controversial local issues such as the relationship between mainstream and periphery, cultural policy and national identity, international Avant-garde and local adaptations, Art market and notion of style, original and aura vs. copy. The use of strategies such as quote and appropriation, as well as manipulation through exhibition curation, simulating institutional mechanisms capable of altering the functionality of each work, would be incorporated to a greater or lesser extent in all ABTV projects. In 1989, while studying at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) (The University of Arts of Cuba), Juan Ballester Carmenates, Jos√© Toirac and Ileana Villaz√≥n were invited to participate in Young Cuban Artist, an exhibition curated by Rachel Weiss for the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. Ballester, Toirac and Villaz√≥n carried out a team work in which they rephotographed reproductions of the famous appropriationist Sherrie Levine, the gesture of appropriation of their reproductions in books and art magazines critically pointed to the only way in which international art could be consumed in Cuba, deprived of direct experience through its massive reproduction. Parodying the titles of the famous North American artist the work was called After Sherrie Levine. This strategy of manipulating through the curatorship of exhibitions and simulating the institutional mechanisms capable of altering the functionality of each work, would be incorporated to a greater or lesser extent in all ABTV projects. For Luis Camnitzer ‚ÄúWhat is interesting in the work of this group is that they do not use the appropriation process like a recipe. Instead, each project has its own distinct structure and point, all carefully researched. The ABTV team can be better understood, in their present work, as a counterpart to the U.S. Group Material than as followers of Sherrie Levine (‚Ä¶) ABTV works with appropriation, or with the appropriation of appropriation, but there is always an ethical component in the work, an element of social criticism. The reference to art becomes a metaphor, not an end in itself, at least not in formalistic terms. A particular tension is created by the use of a procedure traditionally considered unethical, as plagiarism would be, to transmit messages based on moral indignation\\".  ABTV‚Äôs Projects   \\"Nosotros\\": Exposici√≥n antol√≥gica de la obra de Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez (‚ÄúWe\\": Anthological Exhibition of Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez's Work) (1989), Provincial Center for Plastic Arts and Design, Havana, Cuba.  In 1990 ABTV received the Special Prize of the Cuban Section of International Association of Art Critics (IAAC) for this exhibition. From July to December 1988, the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana ((MNBAC) (National Museum of Fine Arts of Cuba) presented a major exhibition of the work of Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez (artist) under the ‚Äúmuseological conception‚Äù of Corina Matamoros, specialist from the Museum. For young Cuban artists, Raul Martinez's work was a point of reference in the problem of recontextualizing international artistic trends within the rigid official discourse of national identity. For ABTV the National Museum presented the work of Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez (artist) as a great socialist, colorful and pop propaganda billboard, which celebrated the social achievements of the Revolution while hiding the complex scaffolding of contradictions of a complex, at times violent, revolutionary process that the same artist had suffered and was somehow implicit in the author's representative irony. The Museum exhibition focused on formal analysis that presented him as a successful artist, while displacing or omitting the contents of his complicated relationship between personal life and artistic production in relation to the social and historical context and its institutions. A few days after the closing of Nosotros (We) at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana (MNBAC) (National Museum of Fine Arts of Cuba), ABTV inaugurated its alternative anthological exhibition at the Provincial Center for Plastic Arts and Design in Havana in January 1989. ‚ÄúWe\\": Anthological Exhibition of the Work of Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez parodied the title of the Museum exhibition and criticized it by emphasizing the problematic contents that the official exhibition avoided. For this ABTV selected six works not included in the official exhibition and accompanied them with factual documentation. One of these works was made by ABTV in collaboration with Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez (artist) as a nod of complicity between the artist and the alternative rereading that the new generations made of the work of the established artist.  Homenaje a Hans Haacke (Homage to Hans Haacke) (1989), Castle of The Force Project, Castle of The Real Force, Havana, Cuba.  It is impossible to understand this project without an introduction to the context. The Proyecto Castillo de la Fuerza (Castle of The Force Project) In the late 1980s, the cultural life of Havana was shaken by a wave of young art critical of the tightness of the structures of the Cuban government. These projects were developed in galleries with high visibility and others were carried out directly in public spaces. Following the controversy, Armando Hart D√°valos, Minister of Culture, published an article in the official Granma (newspaper) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba. In his article, the Minister of Culture did not hide his concern about how the new critical audiovisual production, which was exhibited in some state galleries not suitable for the content of the works, could be received by the Communist Party of Cuba and interpreted by a society without rights to spaces for exercise institutional criticism and without cultural education in Contemporary art. In this context, the Castle of The Force Project arises. Taking as a frame of reference the concerns of the Minister of Culture, its organizers, F√©lix Suazo, Alexis Somoza and Alejandro Aguilera, conceived it as ‚Äúa project that would make it possible to carry out critical artistic proposals in a space for debate that would lay the foundations for later circulation broader social ‚Äù, they were assisted by the former Vice Minister of Culture Marcia Leiseca who then chaired the Consejo Nacional de las Artes Pl√°sticas (CNAP) (National Council of Visual Arts). With irony, the Project took as its name the name of the building where it would be developed, the Castillo de la Real Fuerza (Castle of the Royal Force) of Havana, an old Spanish military fortress that, after having been the headquarters of different cultural institutions by then, functioned as an exhibition space attached to the National Museum of Fine Arts. The production process of the Project included several meetings between the organizers, the invited artists and the National Council of Visual Arts subordinated to the Ministry of Culture, the meetings should guarantee the control of the contents as well as an assessment of their possible repercussion in context. The Homage to Hans Haacke exhibition was scheduled as the fifth exhibition and should have opened in late September 1989. ABTV presented their project as a tribute to German conceptual artist Hans Haacke, the parody and quote of \\"political seriousness and professional rigor\\" of the German author's methodology was again used as a resource for a deep critique of institutions and official cultural policy. The exhibition overcame the initial control mechanisms and came to be installed in the Castle, but hours before the opening the alarm went off, the National Council of Visual Arts called an urgent meeting with Omar Gonz√°lez where the contents of some works were questioned because the Ministry of Culture found it problematic. The officials of the Council demanded to suppress information that the artists considered essential for the understanding of their works. Consistent with Haacke's methodology, ABTV refused to meet the Council's demand, them the exhibition was \\"canceled\\" not without the Council first demanding that the content of the meeting not be unveiled in order to prevent the ‚Äúfailed negotiation‚Äù from being construed as official censorship. Tanya Angulo and Jos√© Toirac did not agree to release a note that Juan Ballester Carmenates and Ileana Villaz√≥n wrote detailing the details of the censorship. Ballester and Ileana printed hundreds of copies that they distributed themselves the night Homage to Hans Haacke was due to open. The Ministry of Culture deleted all information related to the censorship of Homage to Hans Haacke. In 1990 the Kuba o.k. exhibition was opened at the Stadtische Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf. The project, which was curated by Jurgen Harten and advised for the Ministry of Culture by the artist Antonio Eligio Tonel, included in the catalog an Osvaldo S√°nchez text on ABTV, as the text provided information on Homage to Hans Haacke, the Ministry of Culture pressured Harten to suppress the Osvaldo S√°nchez text from the catalog. Harten had no choice but to yield to official pressure but finally he published the text as an annex to the catalog, distributing it within him. When the catalog arrived in Cuba, the Ministry of Culture kidnapped all annexes. In 1991, Art collector Peter Ludwig expressed interest in buying the controversial The Smile of Truth, but the National Museum of Fine Arts declared it of heritage interest and acquired it for his collection even though the Museum has never allowed its public display. ABTV was dissolved after the censorship of Homage to Hans Haacke. In 1991 Ileana Villaz√≥n went into exile in Mexico and in 1992 Juan Pablo Ballester went into exile in Spain. ABTV ended its text of presentation of the catalog with the following self-critical reflection: \\"paradoxically, our criticism of the institutional framework could also be registered as institutional self- criticism\\", but the unexpected closure of Homage to Hans Haacke recalled that, even after a period of tolerance, censorship continued to be part of the repressive framework of the totalitarian regime, because \\"...In Cuba, as in any other regime of real socialism, censorship is a resource of the State, inscribed in the Constitution, the Penal Code and the laws\\". The need for dialogue and negotiation that Castle of The Force Project and the Ministry of Culture failed. For Osvaldo S√°nchez: \\"Homage to Hans Haacke‚Äô... was announced as an ideological operation worthy of Haacke. The extreme critical acuity towards institutions and representation - cynical, burlesque, terrible - of not a few inconsistencies between art and status, between art and merchandise, between art and politics; It seemed to be more than what the aforementioned institutions could allow. The tribute to Haacke - what a paradox, precisely to him! - never got to opened. The pieces resorted to parody effects, especially promotional manipulation was parodied. The important thing was to accuse the institutional mechanism (commercial or political) that corrupted the semantic nature of the work (‚Ä¶) Even though it has not was opened, Homage to Hans Haacke is one of the key exhibitions of the 1980s in Cuba; and not precisely for the reasons that determined its cancellation. Whoever likes it, the Cuban visual art from 90‚Äôs will have it as a paradigm‚Äù. The Castle of The Force Project was closed after the censorship of Homage to Hans Haacke and the castle became the Museum of Cuban Contemporary Ceramics. In a new act of demonstration of power, the Cuban Communist Party reaffirmed the limits that young visual artists questioned as a revolutionary act. After the Project was censored, an atmosphere of cultural repression was unleashed, reminiscent of the atmosphere of \\"dark episodes\\" that occurred before the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1976.  Homage to Hans Haacke‚Äôs works  = 1556‚Äî1988 = Work 1556‚Äî1988 established a parallel between the history of the construction of the Castillo de la Real Fuerza (Castle of The Real Force) in Havana and the history of the organization of the Castle of The Force Project. The comparison revealed analogies in terms of objectives, official production, setbacks in performance, limitations and expectations of its defensive function. = La sonrisa de la verdad (The Smile of Truth) = Orlando Yanes is a painter promoted as an official artist by the Communist Party of Cuba, because his realistic work specializes in portraits of revolutionary heroes. The Smile of Truth presented a large portrait of smiling Yanes in the billboard style of Che that he had designed for the facade of the building of the Ministerio del Interior (MININT) (Ministry of the Interior (Cuba)) in the Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n (Revolution Square) and included his quote of 1963: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ we can count on a powerful source of inspiration such as our Revolution. This fact imposes on us a fundamental question: How to merge aesthetic demands with revolutionary inspiration? I believe that the answer cannot be condensed into an only one formula; I believe that each artist must find his formula‚Äù. The portrait in the style of a revolutionary propaganda billboard was supplemented by factual documentation, a resume witch included significant - omitted - facts from his artistic career before the Cuban Revolution along with photographic documentation of a portrait of Fulgencio Batista from 1952 and another one of Fidel Castro from 1986 formally represented with the same style. The work demonstrated how Orlando Yanes had used the same \\"formula\\" to express two different political realities and obtain personal benefits with the complicity of the institutions. = Ave F√©nix (The Phoenix) = This work included a photocopy of the article by Jose Mar√≠a Juara \\"Hay razones para quemar un cuadro‚Äù (There are reasons to burn a painting) where the author explains the political reasons why he bought the painting El Pavo Real (The Peacock) by Manuel Mendive and later burned it in front of the Cuban Museum in Miami. According to Juara, his burning was a symbolic way to protest against \\"the artists who still collaborate with Castro's tyranny\\" and against the sale of Cuban Marxist culture in Miami. For his work ABTV bought a serigraphy by Manuel Mendive to Fondo Cubano de Bienes Culturales (BFC) (Cuban Fund of Cultural Assets) and burned it as a performance that appropriated Juara's action. The video documenting the burning of ABTV was accompanied by the text ‚ÄúHay razones para quemar una serigraf√≠a‚Äù (There are reasons to burn a serigraphy) in which its authors explained that their action opposed Juara's political manipulation, but also the cultural manipulation of the Cuban Fund of Cultural Assets by the ‚Äúhyperbolization of the exchange values and commodification of the Cuban cultural heritage assuming the work of Manuel Mendive as the victim and a banner of this policy‚Äù. = Una imagen recorre el mundo (An Image Travels the World) = In An Image Travels the World, ABTV told the little-known story in Cuba of the photograph of Che Guevara taken by Alberto Korda that became famous thanks to the editing and marketing of the publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli. The Italian publisher visited Havana looking for the image that he would use on the cover of his publication of the Diario del \\"Che\\" in Bolivia and the Poster that would accompany the edition. Feltrinelli chose a photo of Che de Korda and edited it, Feltrinelli did not pay copyrights and Korda did not claim them, among other things, because in the first years of the Revolution, Cuba maintained an ambiguous relationship with international Copyright laws. ABTV used the history of photography as a pretext to denounce the process of cultural and commercial fetishization to which the image is subjected by conserving, as if it were unique, an object that by its nature is multiple; and ideological fetishization as it is promoted as the image that best embodies the values of the historical character. ABTV emphasized that this fetishization was not an inherent quality of the object but was determined by the institutions that preserve and promote it. An Image Travels the World reproducing the famous photograph superimposed with its history and the work would be finished when it was sold - as a poster that recognizes itself as merchandise - for a three-peso bill. Ernesto Che Guevara had been president of the National Bank of Cuba from 1959 to 1961, in 1983 the Bank printed his three Pesos bill for the first time, it did not include the original photo of Korda but the Feltrinelli edition that made it famous. The purchase of the poster closed the cycle of the commodification of the hero reduced to its currency value. = Notas de Glexis (Glexis Notes) = ABTV closed her exhibition with this work that reflected on how the critique of institutions would end up becoming part of her falsely self-critical discourse. To do this, they intentionally invited Glexis Novoa, an artist who had already participated in the Castle of The Force Project. Glexis Notes was a work that would function as an \\"alternative\\" curatorial project within the Homage to Hans Haacke and the Project itself. For ABTV \\"Glexis appropriates the methodology of Homage to Hans Haacke to parody our attitude towards the institutional framework that promotes us. This work reveals that Glexis's critical attitude was premeditated by us in the same way that the institution that promotes the Project (National Council of Visual Arts), anticipated and sustained our criticism of it. These appropriation and parody procedures show that the Ministry of Culture offered its support to the Project as a way to update its institutional policy and management; that we take advantage of such coverage to make this exhibition; that Glexis used us ‚Äôto re-expose in the Project, and that we used Glexis to express all of the above\\".  ¬°Juntos y Adelante!. Arte, Pol√≠tica y Voluntad de representaci√≥n (Together and Forward!. Art, Politics and Willpower of Representation) (1991), IV Havana Biennial, House of the Young Creator, Havana, Cuba.  In 1991 ABTV regrouped for this final project. Por la plena igualdad. Juntos y adelante (For full equality. Together and Forward) was the slogan of a propaganda billboard designed by the Editora Pol√≠tica (Political Publisher) in the early 90s. ABTV used as the conceptual structure of the project the same inclusive rhetoric of the political slogan that they cited, for this occasion they invited artists from different generations to participate, with opposing aesthetic discourses, with various formal solutions, both artists promoted by the Ministry of Culture and artists marginalized by institutions and their circumstantial cultural policies. For this project ABTV rescued works by artists who had fallen into oblivion such as the so-called Socialist realism cuban artists who in the 1970s went to study Art in the former Soviet Union, for example, from this group of realistic artists, Cosme Proenza was invited to exhibit alongside young critical artists such as Pedro √Ålvarez Castell√≥. Together and Forward! parodied the ideological cynicism with which the Editora Pol√≠tica (Political Editor) advertised the achievements of social integration of the Cuban Revolution. In this project, ABTV acted as curators of a choral group show that they inserted from a small cultural institution into the great official event of the IV Havana Biennial. The exhibition and the montage design of the works evaded any notion of hierarchy for use in local institutions, the works were distributed in the space through a visual design that privileged their formal values.

He is regarded by many Guarani as a national hero, known for his struggle to defend his peoples' land and liberty from the encroaching Bolivian government, cattle ranchers, and missionaries. He was executed after his defeat and the failure of his revolt. His death is commemorated annually by many Guarani, and a Guaran√≠ language university in the community of Kuruyuki, Bolivia is named after him. Early life Apiaguaiki was probably born in 1863 in the community of Yohay, a few miles northeast of Boyuibe in Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. His mother was a servant for one of the large Creole (white or mixed blood Bolivians) cattle ranchers in the region. The identify of his father is unknown. His birth name was Chapiaguasu.Langer, Erick D. (2009), Expecting Pears from an Elm Tree, Durham, NC: Duke University Press, p. 187 When Chapiaguasa was about 10 years old he apparently fled with his mother from the ranch and took up residence among a group of traditional Guarani, more commonly called \\"Chiriguanos\\" at that time, in a community called Murukuyati. He was probably present when Creoles killed a large number of Guarani in November 1877, including his mother, in the massacre of Murukuyati. Subsequently, Chapiaguasa acquired the rudiments of Christianity at the Franciscan mission of Santa Rosa, near the town of Cuevo, served as a messenger for Chiriquano leaders, and became a shaman. He acquired a reputation as a healer. In 1891, he became the leader of the community of Ivo, titled himself Apiaguaiki, the \\"eunuch of God.\\" and was selected by the Chiriguanos in Ivo to be \\"Tumpa\\" - a prophet or holy man. Thus, he became a rival of the Franciscan missionaries in the nearby Santa Rosa mission who claimed a monopoly of the healing arts and spiritual matters.Langer, pp. 187-188; Hurtado Guzman, Emilio (2011), \\"Apaiguaiqui Tumpa, la ultima esperanza de la liberation guarani-chiriguana frente al Estado republicano colonial,\\" Biblioteca Virtual, , accessed 20 Jan 2017 The war of 1892 For 400 years, the Chiriguanos had resisted the encroachment on their lands and culture by the Inca Empire, the Spanish Empire, and the independent country of Bolivia. However, from the 1860s onward the pressure on them from Creole ranchers and settlers and Franciscan missionaries increased. Many Chiriguanos became Christians and Creole ranchers took over many of their traditional lands. They were defeated in the Huacaya War of 1874-1877.Langer, pp. 11-18 Apiaguaiki rose to power as a messianic leader of a millenarian movement. Typically, millenarian movements predict a return to an imagined golden age of a culture and the defeat of enemies by supernatural forces. These movements are especially common among people living under colonialism or other disruptive and oppressive forces.\\"Millennialism\\", Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/millennialism/Millennialism-from- the-Renaissance-to-the-modern-world, accessed 20 January 2017 By the end of 1891, Apiaguaiki had assembled what a missionary estimated (probably exaggerated) as 5,000 men, plus women and children, in the community of Kuruyuki or Curuyuqui, from the Santa Rosa mission. The rape and murder of a Chiriguano girl on December 31 1891 by the mayor of Cuevo set off the revolt. After some success in early ambushes, on January 21, 1892 Apiaguaiki led an assault on the Santa Rosa mission which failed. The Bolivian soldiers, creole volunteers, and Christian Indians counterattacked on January 28 in the Battle of Kuruyuki. Apiaguiaki was soundly defeated.Hurtado Guzman Execution In the aftermath of the Battle of Kuruyuki, the soldiers, Creoles, and Christian Indians hunted down and killed an estimated 6,000 Chiriguanos. A month after the battle Apiaguaiki was betrayed by a supporter and captured. He was tortured and executed by a firing squad on March 29, 1892 in Sauces, present day Monteagudo. The official report of his execution said that \\"Apiaguaiki died with the haughtiness of a great leader.\\"Saignes, Thierry (2007), ed. Isabelle Combes, Historia del pueblo chiriguano, Lima, Peru: Instituto Frances de Estudios Andinos, p. 158. With the death of Apiaguaiki, armed resistance by the Eastern Bolivian Guarani or Chiriguanos to the Bolivian government, the Creole settlers, and the Franciscan missionaries ended.Hurtado Guzman University In 2009, Bolivian president Evo Morales attended a commemoration of the Battle of Kuruyuki and inaugurated the \\"Apiaguaki Tumpa Indigenous University of the Lowlands\\" located in the community of Kuruyuki, now more commonly spelled Quruyuqui.\\"Educaci√≥n en Bolivia\\", 28 January 2009, http://e-ducacionboliviana.blogspot.com/2009/01/guaranis-conmemoran-batalla- de-kuruyuki.html, accessed 21 Jan 2017 References Bibliography *Saignes, Thierry (2007), ed.

In a Chilandar charter of Uro≈° IV Du≈°an, Vojihna is mentioned as \\"nobleman and associate of my Empire, cousin Vojihna\\".Knji≈æevno delo monahinje Jefimije, p. 1 This has been interpreted in several ways; Cirkovic understand this as the two are relatives, but the degree of kinship can not be determined.Zapis Rajƒçina Sudiƒáa kao istorijski izvor, pp. 9‚Äì10 According to Vojicic, he is the son of Uro≈°ica, however this would mean that they are second cousins, thus Purkovic connects the kinship through Stefan Konstantin, making the two cousins. It is thought that he is the same as the ≈Ωupan Vojihna, who is mentioned in 1323, as an ally of Stephen Vladislav II, during the war of the throne against Stephen Uro≈° III following the death of Stephen Milutin. With emphasis on Vladislav II being the son of Dragutin, and Du≈°an calling Vojihna his cousin, this might be an evidence on Vojihna being the son of Uro≈°ica, the brother of Vladislav II. Life In 1341, Andronikos III Palaiologos died, which sparked a civil war in the Byzantine Empire. In 1342 Du≈°an became an ally of John VI Kantakouzenos, but only a year after, switched to the side of John V Palaiologos. Kantakouzenos found new allies in the Emirate of Aydin. In 1344, Du≈°an sent a small army led by Voivode Preljub to intercept the Aydin Turks. The Serbs were defeated in battle at Stephaniana, however it did not halt the Serbian conquest. Serbian Empire, 1355. Stephen Uro≈° IV Du≈°an, called \\"Du≈°an the Mighty\\" was proclaimed Emperor at Serres in 1345. In this southeasternmost part of his Empire, Du≈°an appointed Voihna as governor of Drama, not far from Serres, before November 1345. When Du≈°an was crowned \\"Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks\\" at Skopje on 16 April 1346, he also crowned his son Uro≈° V as King. Among his royal members and nobility he appointed Simeon Uro≈°, Jovan Asen, Jovan Oliver as Despots, and Dejan Draga≈°, Branko Mladenoviƒá as Sebastokrators, and Grgur Golubiƒá, Preljub and Voihna (before 1348) as Caesars. He was second in rank to Caesar Grgur. In the end of 1347 or early 1348, he followed Du≈°an to Mount Athos. He donated the village of Potolino in the lower Struma province to the Chilandar in 1348. Fresco of Emperor Stefan Du≈°an, his wife Helena, and their son Stefan Uro≈° V. Immediately after Du≈°an's death (20 December 1355), his wife Empress Helena was found in Serres. She started to exert her imperial control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying she was in the region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son- in-law Uglje≈°a Mrnjavƒçeviƒá (the son of Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Du≈°an, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control. Matthew Kantakouzenos led another civil war against John V Palaiologos, and when Vojihna heard that Matthew was coming with his Turkish troops (the Emirate of Aydin) he immediately consulted the court. As allies of John V (a relative Uro≈°), Uro≈° assembled an army for his mother that was led by Vojihna.The Serbs and Byzantium during the reign of Tsar Stephen Du≈°an (1331‚Äì55) and his successors, p. 88-90 Among the forces were also Serbs from the vicinity of Serres.Studies on the internal diaspora of the Byzantine Empire, p. 156 In fall of 1356 he captured Matthew Kantakouzenos, the rival Byzantine Emperor and son of the former Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (1347‚Äì54).The Serbs, p. 76 Vojihna planned to release Matthew for a ransom, but soon realized that Emperor John V Palaiologos was willing to offer a far greater sum. Matthew renounced his territory and imperial title in December 1357 and John V continued to rule as sole Emperor.

Biography  Samuel Luccock Black was born December 22, 1859 in Kimbolton, Guernsey County, Ohio. His parents were William Black and Marie Luccock. He graduated at the public schools of Cambridge, Ohio in 1878, and Ohio Wesleyan University in 1883. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1887. Black moved to Columbus, Ohio immediately after admission to the bar and set up practice with Powell, Owen, Ricketts, and Black. He continued private practice until elected a judge. He first ran for office in 1896 for Probate Judge of Franklin County, but lost to Tod B. Galloway. He ran for Mayor of Columbus and defeated Republican Emmett Tompkins in the spring of 1897. While he was mayor, the Union Station was completed, the municipal electric light plant and West Side levee (on the Scioto River) were completed, and the water system was improved.

The species is endemic to western Iran, and was originally described in 2006. The head looks very similar to that of other Pseudocerastes species in the region, but the spider- tailed horned viper has a unique tail that has a bulb-like end that is bordered by long drooping scales that give it the appearance of a spider. The tail tip is waved around and used to lure insectivorous birds to within striking range. (Pseudocerastes urarachnoides, new species). Description Like other vipers in the genus Pseudocerastes, the scales above the eyes rise up to give P. urarachnoides a horned appearance. A specimen had been collected in 1968 as part of the Second Street Expedition to Iran and deposited in the Field Museum of Natural History at Chicago, identified as Pseudocerastes persicus. It was, however, found to be distinct, and it was described as a new species in 2006. The species is distinguished by a number of characteristics. There are about 16 to 17 scales between the horns, and the scales on the body above are rougher than on other species in the genus. There are 15 pairs of subcaudal scales, and the scales on the sides of the tail are elongated and appear like appendages of an arthropod. The tip of the tail is inflated into a bulb-like shape. The tail resembles a spider or other arachnid, and the authors who described the species speculated that it was used as a lure to attract birds, as a digested lark had been found in the stomach of the paratype specimen. The tip of the tail is used as a lure in several species of snake, including Bitis caudalis, Crotalus cerastes, Sistrurus catenatus, Agkistrodon contortrix, Acanthophis antarcticus, Acanthophis praelongus, and Morelia viridis, but none of these examples has the unique elongated scales that give it the appearance of arthropod appendages. The actual use of the tail to lure birds (an example of caudal luring) was confirmed by later studies in the field. Footage of the spider-tailed horned viper using its tail to lure a migrating bird featured in the Asia episode of the BBC series Seven Worlds, One Planet narrated by David Attenborough. This species overlaps in distribution with P. fieldi in Gilan-e Gharb, next to Qasr-e Shirin, Kermanshah, and with P. persicus in Bina and Bijar, Ilam Province. Molecular studies based on cytochrome b show it to be closer to Pseudocerastes persicus than to P. fieldi. Etymology The specific name, urarachnoides, is derived from Ancient Greek ( tail + spider + like), and refers to this snake's spider- like tail tip, as does the common name, spider-tailed horned viper.

It was the story of Charlie Redmond, the man who was sent off twice in the same All-Ireland final. Pre-game Redmond sustained a groin injury while practising free-taking on the Thursday ahead of the match. Dublin manager Dr Pat O'Neill told Redmond (according to Redmond's own account) the day before the game: \\"We'll look after you, we'll give you an injection, we'll sort it out\\". Redmond said: \\"So in my head I was thinking I was going to have an injection that was going to sort me out. So 20 minutes before the game, I said, 'Okay, Pat, I'm ready to get the injection'. He says, 'I don't give injections'. I said, 'What are you talking about?' He says, 'Charlie, I have never given a player a pain-killing injection and I never will, if you can't play put your track-suit on. If you can play then get out and play'. He knew by telling me I'd get an injection that I'd relax from the Friday or Saturday\\". Match Summary Redmond opted to start the game in spite of his groin injury. He scored Dublin's goal late in the first half, further damaging his groin as he did so. Peter Canavan hit eleven of Tyrone's twelve points, but missed a late free that would have tied the game.High Ball magazine, issue 6, 1998 The final is best remembered though for one incident early in the second half. Redmond, the Dublin goal scorer, headbutted Fergal Logan and referee Paddy Russell; however, Redmond refused to leave the field. Play resumed and Redmond became involved in a further Dublin attack receiving the ball from Mick Deegan, Deegan having had it passed to him by Keith Barr. Redmond sent the ball a considerable distance, towards Dessie Farrell. Farrell then tripped Tyrone back Chris Lawn and the referee blew his whistle. Paul Clarke charged in and kicked Lawn while he was on the ground; Clarke had his name taken by the referee, this nearly two minutes after Redmond had been sent off. While this was occurring, Tony O'Donoghue provided an update from the sideline for RT√â television viewers on the extent of Fergal Logan's \\"very bad\\" ankle injury. Finbar McConnell moved to take the free for Tyrone but was stopped short by a further blow from the referee's whistle. As the referee gently ambled towards standby referee Willie O'Mahony, the television commentator mentioned \\"a potential nightmare few minutes there for‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Dublin, and for Charlie Redmond in particular\\". O'Mahony exchanged words with the referee at the side of the field. The referee then headed in the direction of Redmond, shaking his head sternly, and began ushering Redmond from the field. The TV commentator said: \\"This is very confusing. I've never seen anything like this in an All-Ireland final. [Pause] I think he has sent him off! [Further pause] So Dublin are indeed down to fourteen players\\". The incident lasted more than three minutes, before Redmond left the field, shaking his head.RT√â video footage (available on YouTube). Note that Se√°n Moran, writing in The Irish Times in 2019, claimed erroneously that: \\"Watched on YouTube, the forbidden period on the field comes in at 28 seconds ‚Äî admittedly that's nearly half a minute more than ideal, but not nearly the length of time some had thought, and during which Redmond never touched the ball\\". The \\"forbidden time\\" when viewed on YouTube is more than three minutes and Redmond did in fact touch the ball. Tyrone Line Up  [ Tyrone: F McConnell; P Devlin, C Lawn, F Devlin; R McGarrihy, S McCallan, S McLaughlin; F Logan, J Gormley; C Corr (capt), Pascal Canavan, C Loughran; C McBride, Peter Canavan, S Lawn. Subs: M McGleenan for C Loughran; B Gormley for S Lawn; P Donnelly for S McCallan, Brendan Mallon, Adrian Cush, Gerard Cavlan, Adrian Nuggent, Danny Barr, Stephen Conway ] Post-match Redmond joked afterwards that he thought Russell was \\"waving to his family\\". The incident prompted the GAA to introduce red and yellow cards. Many years later, Redmond encountered Russell at a function. Redmond said Russell remembered it better than he did. \\"I apparently said, 'Paddy, you are making a huge mistake and you will be able to see it tonight on television' and he said, 'Well, that's a mistake I'm willing to make'\\". Redmond is teased by children whom he says were unborn at the time of the incident. Peter Canavan was named Footballer of the Year. Tyrone would not appear in another All-Ireland final until 2003. Dublin would not appear in another All-Ireland final until 2011. This was Dublin's last All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title until they won the 2011 final. The two teams did not meet again in an All-Ireland final until 2018.

The complex opened in 1966, and is located at 71 HaYarkon Street in Tel Aviv. It will continue to house most of the activities and staff of the former United States Embassy as it did before May 14, 2018, when the seat of embassy was relocated to Jerusalem. In December 2017, President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and ordered that the US Embassy be moved there. The US Embassy in Israel relocated to Arnona, the site of the consular section of the US Consulate General on May 14, 2018. A space was carved out in that building for office space for the Ambassador and a small staff. The Ambassador will continue to conduct most Embassy business in Tel Aviv where the old Embassy has been designated an Embassy Branch Office. This move coincided with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. History The United States was the first country to recognize the newly founded state of Israel on 14 May 1948, immediately following Israel's proclamation of independence. U.S. President Harry S. Truman subsequently announced that there would be an exchange of missions: > Agreement has been reached between the Government of the United States and > the Provisional Government of Israel on the establishment of a mission of > the United States in Israel and a mission of the Provisional Government of > Israel in the United States. Agreement has also been reached on the exchange > of special representatives. On 22 June, Clark Clifford, President Truman's aide, called James G. McDonald telling him that the President wanted McDonald to be the United States' first representative to Israel. During his ambassadorship, McDonald helped strengthen relations between the two governments. For example, in 1950, the United States and Israel entered into an \\"Aviation Agreement\\" that allowed Trans World Airlines (TWA) to operate fully out of Israel and El Al to send regular flights to the United States. Ambassador McDonald hoped the signing of the first formal agreement between the two governments would be the first in a series of similar agreements that would gradually bind the two countries and peoples closer together in creative co-operative work. For many years, there was controversy surrounding the Tel Aviv location of the United States embassy because Israel has identified Jerusalem as its capital while the United States had not recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In late 2017, however, United States President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital, subject to further definition, and announced the intention to relocate the United States embassy, which occurred on May 14, 2018. Walworth Barbour served as Ambassador of the United States to Israel from 1961‚Äì1973, which is when the Embassy re-located to its present location of 71 Hayarkon Street. He assumed his post already very familiar with the Middle East and South Eastern Europe but with \\"no particular interest in Israel one way or another.\\" Nevertheless, Barbour was Ambassador to Israel for 12 years, and when asked why he stayed so long he answered, \\"I like it.\\" The American International School in Even Yehuda, Israel is named after him. Before the embassy moved to Jerusalem in 2018, the embassy in Tel Aviv was one of the few American embassies not located in the national capital (others included the Embassy of the United States, The Hague and the Embassy of the United States, Attard). Congressman Tom Lantos and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan contrasted this with the fact that, during the Cold War, the American Embassy to East Germany was located in its de facto capital of East Berlin, even though the United States never recognized that city as the capital. Organization The U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv maintains and promotes diplomatic and people-to-people relations between the United States and Israel. The Branch Office has as a large staff of officers and specialists who are responsible for all aspects of economic, political, commercial, military, media, educational, cultural, and humanitarian relations. Tel Aviv operates one of the State Department's busiest Non-Immigrant Visa sections, which produces the highest volume of nonimmigrant visas in the Middle East. The US Citizens Services Unit is the State Department's third largest ACS office overseas, and the volume of U.S. passports issued makes Tel Aviv the second largest passport operation in the world.

Jerusalem Embassy Act Consulate-General at Agron Street, Jerusalem The Jerusalem Embassy Act, passed by Congress in 1995, required the United States to relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by December 31, 1999 and that Jerusalem be recognized as the capital of Israel. The Embassy remained in Tel Aviv because the Act also allowed for the President to \\"delay the implementation of the law indefinitely if the move presents national security concerns.\\"Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, , Nov. 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama regularly invoked the clause, delaying the move of the embassy to Jerusalem. On December 6, 2017, President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel subject to further definition as to boundaries and ordered the Embassy moved to Jerusalem. The relocation process was originally expected to take around 4 years. On February 23, 2018, it was announced that the US Embassy in Israel would move to the Arnona Consular Section facility of the US Consulate General on May 14, 2018. Until early March 2019, the United States maintained a separate Consulate General in Jerusalem for conducting relations with Jerusalem, West Bank, and Gaza Strip. The Consulate General dates back to 1844 during the Ottoman period. On October 18, 2018, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the merger of the US Embassy and Consulate General in Jerusalem into a single diplomatic mission. On March 4, 2019, the US Consulate General ceased operating as an independent mission and was formally integrated into the US Embassy. Its former Agron Street premises will be occupied by a special Palestinian Affairs Unit, which will assume many of its former functions but reports directly to the Embassy.

Its devices were used in vascular access, emergency and disaster medicine, oncology, and spinal surgery. Privately held, the company was based in San Antonio, Texas, and its products were marketed in over 50 countries worldwide.Biomed SA Shareholders: Vidacare Corporation In December 2013, Teleflex Incorporated, based in Wayne, Pennsylvania, revealed that it had completed the acquisition of Vidacare Corporation for $263 million. History The intraosseous space was first discovered as a non- collapsible vein in 1922 when C.K. Drinker, MD, of Harvard University examined the circulation of the sternum and confirmed that fluids infused into the bone marrow were quickly absorbed into the central circulation, providing a viable alternative to failed vascular access with traditional methods. However, a reliable, safe and easy method to access this intraosseous space proved elusive and this area of medicine and its opportunities remained largely unexplored. In the mid-1990s, the technologies behind Vidacare's products were developed at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, in the Athanasiou laboratory by Kyriacos A. Athanasiou, George Constantinides, and Dan Lanctot. In 2000, Dr. Larry Miller, an emergency physician for over 30 years and one of Vidacare‚Äôs founders, set out to develop a technology platform that could be utilized in a broad range of health care settings. These applications included vascular access, bone marrow biopsies and aspirations, regenerative medicine and more. In 2001, Vidacare Corporation was established to bring this technology platform to market. In 2004, Vidacare received its first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the EZ-IO Intraosseous Infusion System ‚Äì the first battery-powered device to establish immediate vascular access using the IO space.Wall Street Journal presents innovation award to Vidacare In 2007, Vidacare received additional FDA clearance for the OnControl Bone Marrow System, the first significant improvement to bone marrow procedures in decades.Sales of Vidacare‚Äôs bone marrow system expands nationwide In 2008, the company received FDA clearance for the OnControl Bone Access System for use in spinal surgery procedures. In 2010, Vidacare claimed that its EZ-IO technology was used in 90 percent of U.S. advanced life support ambulances, over half of U.S. emergency departments, and by the U.S. military. The company stated it also was able to market the device in over 50 countries.Nursing Consortium Releases Consensus Paper on the Use of Intraosseous Vascular Access for Emergent and Non-Emergent Situations In December 2013, Teleflex Incorporated completed the acquisition of Vidacare, integrating its products into Teleflex's Arrow product line.

Charles Davies Sherborn (30 June 1861 ‚Äì 22 June 1942) was an English bibliographer, paleontologist and geologist.Shindler, 2016 His magnum opus was the compilation of the Index Animalium, an 11-volume, 9,000-page work that catalogued the 444,000 names of every living and extinct animal discovered between 1758 and 1850. This work is considered the bibliographic foundation for zoological nomenclature. In addition, Sherborn authored almost 200 books, papers, and catalogs on a wide variety topics in natural history. He made important contributions to the study of microfossils and was a founding member and first president of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History.Evenhuis, 2016 In recognition of his endeavours he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Oxford University. Early life Sherborn was the eldest son of Charles William Sherborn, a Chelsea engraver of some renown, and Hannah Sherborn (n√©e Simpson). As a youth he was an enthusiastic collector of rocks, fossils, and freshwater shells. His father ran into difficulties in business which forced him to quit studies at 14 and seek work. For the next several years he worked in the book trade at a bookshop on Bond Street followed by work as a clerk in a tailoring shop. During his spare time he studied at the Museum of Practical Geology and read at the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Geology  A sample of Sherborn's mollusc collection at the Natural History Museum Sherborn developed a passionate interest in geology and paleontology and in 1883 he was asked by geologist Thomas Rupert Jones to help illustrate and complete some papers he was writing on fossil Foraminifera. Jones was to become a close colleague and mentor for Sherborn. By 1887, they had published three papers, with Sherborn providing the illustrations. Challenged by the great number of journals they had to consult in preparing their papers, Sherborn began to compile his first bibliography, A Bibliography of the Foraminifera, published in 1888.Miller, 2016 Around this time he was hired by the Geology department at the Natural History Museum to clean and prepare fossils. His pay was based on the number of fossils he prepared. In this new role he had the opportunity to collaborate with Arthur Smith Woodward, an expert on fossil fish and another influential colleague in Sherborn's career.  Bibliography  Encouraged by the success of his first bibliography, Sherborn began to contemplate a much more ambitious project‚Äîthe indexing of every living and extinct animal species discovered since 1758. The scope of what he was proposing may not have been apparent at first; initially he had planned to end the index at 1899. Even after scaling back to 1850, the task before him was immense. He began working on his Index Animalium in 1890. During the day he continued to prepare fossils in the museum while at night he would work at home, methodically going through thousands of books and journals, recording onto slips of paper every species name he came across. In just the first year he reviewed 500 scientific references and recorded about 40,000 names. By the time he was done he had reviewed thousands of books and journals in multiple languages and had created over a million handwritten records. Just sorting the records into alphabetic order took over three years. The first volume was published in 1902 and covered the time period 1758-1800. Covering the next 50 years required another 10 volumes (a measure of the explosive growth of scientific knowledge) and wasn't completed until 1932. In 1892 Sherborn was invited by Reverend Richard Startin Owen to assist on a biography of his grandfather, Richard Owen, founder of the Natural History Museum and one of the most famous scientists of his era.Shindler, 2010 He was required to sort through Owen's papers, which had been left, in piles twelve feet high, in a cowshed exposed to rats and to the elements. Despite Sherborn's great pleasure in the task, the effort involved caused a breakdown in his health that left him nearly incapacitated for three years. Nevertheless, Sherborn succeeded with the enormous task, sorting and distributing hundreds of scientific papers and thousands of pages of correspondence. Sherborn enjoyed bringing his colleagues together for his famous \\"smoke and chat\\" parties at his home. These were usually all-male, informal affairs and guests included museum staff as well as personal friends. He never married; although engaged for ten years, he concluded that his sporadic income would be insufficient to provide for a wife and family.

Biography Caroline (\\"Carrie\\") Bamberger grew up in Baltimore, the fifth of six children born to Elkan Bamberger, who had emigrated from Bavaria in 1840, and Theresa (Hutzler) Bamberger, who was heir to a large Baltimore department store. Her siblings were Clara \\"Lavinia\\" Bamberger; Rosa Bamberger; Louis Bamberger; Julius Bamberger; Pauline Bamberger; and Julia Bamberger. Fuld moved with her brother Louis to Philadelphia in 1883, and the two of them, with business partners Louis Meyer Frank and Felix Fuld, started the business that became L. Bamberger and Co. The four partners all worked in the store and developed new methods of retail advertising and selling. Fuld married Louis Frank in 1883, a marriage that lasted until the latter's death in 1910. In 1913, she married her other business partner, Felix Fuld, outliving also his death in 1929. Neither marriage produced children. Bamberger and Fuld sold L. Bamberger and Co. to R. H. Macy and Co. in June, 1929, before the stock market crash. Subsequently, Fuld devoted her energies to philanthropy. With her husband, and continuing after his death, she contributed to Jewish charities, including Newark's Beth Israel Hospital, the Jewish Relief Committee, and Hadassah. In 1931, she was elected national director of the National Council of Jewish Women. Most remembered, however, is the decision in 1929 by Fuld and her brother to seek the advice of Abraham Flexner, and subsequently to support, and endow financially, his vision for what became the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Fuld and Bamberger contributed $5 million in 1930 for its initial endowment, and approximately $18 million in all over time. Fuld was vice- president of the nascent Institute until 1933, and thereafter was a life trustee. References External links * Joan N.

It went to a replay and was eventually won by Meath, with Mayo losing. Neither team was expected to make the final as the competition got underway; Meath were expected to lose to Carlow in their first game of the Leinster Senior Football Championship. However, it would be for the most significant breach of on-field discipline in the sport's history that the 1996 All-Ireland final would be remembered. The brawl Tommy Dowd got a goal and Brendan Reilly got the winning point but none of this matters: all is forgotten now apart from the infamous brawl which broke out over by the Cusack Stand in the shadow of Hill 16. Every man on the pitch soon found himself in the middle of the melee, apart from Meath's Brendan Reilly, Mayo goalkeeper John Madden and his full-back Kevin Cahill. Mayo could hardly have been surprised; Meath had destroyed favourites Tyrone in the semi-final using similar tactics that caused serious injuries to Brian Dooher, Ciaran McBride and Peter Canavan. Almost 30 players joined in a brawl that will go down in history as one of the worst ever seen at a GAA match. Referee Pat McEnaney sought to punish those he deemed the worst offenders. He decided he would send off Mayo's Liam McHale and Meath's John McDermott. \\"When it all settled down my gut instinct was to send off McDermott with McHale. I had my mind made up on that\\", McEnaney later said. Then he consulted with umpire Francie McMahon, who had witnessed something dreadful. \\"Pat,\\" he said. \\"You're going to have to send off Colm Coyle. He's after dropping about six of them\\". One of the linesmen, Kevin Walsh, intervened to also highlight Coyle's indiscretions. McEnaney sent off McHale and Coyle. McHale has never claimed not to have been involved in the brawl that day; indeed, he is on record as saying: \\"I was right in the middle right from the start\\". Coyle had arrived later. The games The final ended in a draw, Meath getting last-minute point when Colm Coyle pumped the ball in that was allowed to bounce and ended up over the bar. As is customary, a replay followed. Meath won by a point, with goals by Trevor Giles (penalty) and Tommy Dowd.High Ball magazine, issue No. 6, 1998. Meath's Mark O'Reilly was just a boy that day. Brendan O'Reilly scored the winning point. It was the first of two All-Ireland football titles for Meath that decade, followed by success in 1999. This was the second consecutive All- Ireland Senior Football Championship Final replay in which at least at least one player sent off; Gerry McEntee was sent off in the 1988 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final replay. Post-match Inaccurate stories spread afterwards that McEnaney had received hate mail at his home, but, McEnaney later said, the only letter he received (from a Meath supporter) praised McEnaney for how he had handled the brawl. The teams did not meet again the championship until 2009. McHale and McEnaney had not spoken, as of 2009.

It was built in 1794 and is one of the oldest structures in Byram. It is also believed to possibly be the Seth Mead homestead. The house is a rare example of a relatively intact vernacular Colonial dwelling. Its -story, 3-bay frame is covered with original wide clapboards and reveals evidence of the original saltbox roof on both side elevations where the ends of the older clapboards show a stepped pattern depicting the original rear slope of the house before the flat-roofed second- story addition was constructed. The southern side elevation, facing Nickel Street, features a massive fieldstone chimney that was built flush with the outside wall but left exposed at the first story. The bricked-in hole was most likely the result of the removal of a projection that held a beehive oven. Such a projection was found in one of the Lyon houses in nearby Port Chester, New York, which could indicate a family building custom since Phebe Seaman was a Lyon by birth. The windows are rather small and six over six in pattern, also showing a rather anachronistic Colonial trait. The gabled entry foyer is a 20th-century alteration. The interior spaces include a shallow cellar which shows both original and replacement beams, as well as the underside of the original wide plank flooring. The first- and second-story rooms all feature very low ceilings, which gives the house a diminutive appearance, despite its -story height. The first floor‚Äôs front room features a large, reworked fireplace which nevertheless retains its rather massive wood lintel. The second floor‚Äôs front room shows corner posts, a protruding central post, and a peculiar beam along the north wall, several feet below the ceiling. A few original hand-hewn rafters remain in the attic but most have been replaced. The corner lot is attractively landscaped with shade trees, ornamental trees and shrubs. The property also features a well with a red roof matching that of the house. References *Byram Historic Resources Inventory *1867 F.W.

In 1992, she was one of the youngest students ever to matriculate at the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts, Prague (AVU), studying under J. David and J. Sopko, receiving a one-year scholarship (1995) at the San Francisco Art Institute, and a Master of Arts degree in 2000. She made her first big splash in the art world in 1998 with Castle in the Sky, a large-scale light installation funded by the Soros Foundation. In it, the famous Prague Castle was completely illuminated in a rainbow glow for several nights, and it‚Äôs still considered one of the largest public art displays to take place in the Czech Republic. The rainbow symbolism from \\"Castle in the Sky\\" was naturally incorporated into Drahotova‚Äôs ever-growing iconographic vocabulary. This highly visualized language of symbols appears persistently throughout her work across all mediums, encouraging a sense of interconnectedness within and between each. The evolution of that iconography can clearly be seen in her early portrait work, which includes the postmodern series ‚ÄúBad Boys‚Äù (1997-2004), and plays out prominently in her constructed objects and installations, such as FF (for S. H.; 2004) and POP (Preliminary Orientation in the Problem; 1999). Her work was most recently featured in Vienna for Art‚Äôs Sake (Feb. 2015), a group show with contributions from more than 100 visual artists, including Christo, Frank Gheary and Zaha Hadid, which will tour Europe and the U.S. as the ‚ÄúLuciano Benetton Collection 10 x 12.‚Äù Her most recent series‚Äô have focused more on painting, specifically large- scale canvases filled with geometric objects that merge with and collide into 3-D relief elements, an implicit commentary on the tension between philosophy and psychology, spiritualism and mathematics. Furthermore, Drahotova has created a new system of painting she refers to as ‚Äòarchitectonic.‚Äô This approach utilizes two or more canvases in a single painting, allowing the pieces to be arranged in several predetermined ways to reveal different compositions. By orientating or interchanging the canvases both horizontally and vertically, and rotating them 90 degrees in relation to each other, several compositions emerge. In this way, the canvases of the recent series ‚ÄúMassive Memory‚Äù (2015) can be arranged together on the wall in various interchangeable configurations, like interactive panels in a constantly shifting landscape. In 2002 Drahotova founded HOME Gallery in Prague, and as director curated more than a dozen exhibitions over two years featuring artists from all over Europe.The Prague Post, archived on Think Magazine, Jan. 2003, by Lizzy Le Quesne She has had more than ten solo shows in the U.S., Japan, and across Europe, and participated in dozens of group shows.

After a United Mine Workers of America local struck a mine in Virden, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company hired armed detectives or security guards to accompany African- American strikebreakers to start production again. An armed conflict broke out when the train carrying these men arrived at Virden. The detectives shot first but strikers were also armed: a total of four detective/security guards and seven striking mine workers were killed, with five guards and more than thirty miners wounded. In addition, an unrecorded number of the 50 black strikebreakers on the train were wounded. The engineer pulled out and drove the train on to Springfield, Illinois. This was one of several fatal conflicts in the area at the turn of the century that reflected both labor union tension and racial violence. Virden When the United Mine Workers struck a mine in Virden, Illinois, in September 1898, the owner, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company, recruited African-American miners as strikebreakers. On September 24, a trainload of potential strikebreaking African-American miners pulled into Virden on the Chicago & Alton Railroad (C&A; RR, multiple tracks to the west, right in the photograph). Representatives of UMWA Local 693 told the miners that they were entering a strike. That train continued north to Springfield, Illinois without incident. On October 12, 1898, another northbound train pulled into Virden, loaded with about fifty African-American potential strikebreakers. The train had brought the recruited workers from Birmingham, Alabama via East St. Louis. There it had taken on detectives from the Thiel Detective Service Company, who were armed with Winchester rifles and orders to protect the strikebreakers. It stopped on the C&A; RR tracks just outside the minehead stockade. As the strikers attempted to surround the train, the guards opened fire. The strikers were also armed. As a gun battle broke out in and around the strikebreakers' train, there were dead and wounded on both sides. Seven miners were killed, and 30 wounded; four Thiel guards were killed and five wounded. Many black strikebreakers on the train were also wounded but their casualties were not recorded.Encyclopedia of American Race Riots, By Walter C. Rucker, James N. Upton, page 673 After twenty minutes of firing on both sides, the train's engineer pulled away from the minehead, keeping the strikebreakers in their cars, and continued northward to Springfield, Illinois.Rosemary Feuer. \\"Remember Virden! The Coal Mines Wars of 1898-1900.\\" Illinois History Teacher, Volume 13:2, 2006, pp. 10‚Äì22. online edition Calling in the National Guard Battle of Virden Illinois, 1898 Governor Tanner ordered the Illinois National Guard to prevent any more strikebreakers from arriving in the state. He said that if another rail car carried strikebreakers into the state, he would \\"shoot it to pieces with Gatling guns.\\"Paul D. Moreno, Blacks and Organized Labor: a New History, (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2008) 61. In compliance to Tanner's orders, the captain in charge of the Illinois Guard at Pana promised: \\"If any negros are brought into Pana while I am in charge, and if they refuse orders to retreat when ordered to do so, I will order my men to fire. If I lose every man under my command no negros shall land at Pana.\\" The governor admitted that he had no legal authority for his action to prevent strikebreakers, but said that he was doing the will of the people. The mine owners capitulated in mid-November and accepted the UMWA unionization of the Virden coal mines. The union and the mine owners agreed to segregate the Virden mines. Virden enforced segregation as a sundown town for decades thereafter. A monument in the Virden town square commemorates the coal strike of 1898 and the battle of October 12 that was its bitter end. The monument contains a large bronze bas-relief that includes the names of those killed in the battle, and a copy of a recruiting handbill distributed by the Chicago-Virden Company in Birmingham, Alabama, to recruit the Negro miners. The body of the bas-relief is made of symbolic representations of the Chicago & Alton tracks and the assault on the strikers. The guards are shown pointing their Winchesters at the strikers and their families. Atop the bas-relief is a bronze portrait of Mary Harris Jones (\\"Mother Jones\\"). Mother Jones is buried in the Union Miners Cemetery in nearby Mount Olive, Illinois, alongside miners who died in the October 1898 conflict.\\"Service Tomorrow for Mother Jones,\\" The Washington Post, Dec 2, 1930, pg. 12. Related conflicts The UMWA and coal mine owners were involved in similar conflicts in three other towns where the owners hired guards and strikebreakers: the Pana Massacre in Pana, Illinois on April 10, 1899; in Lauder (now Cambria, Illinois) on June 30; and in Carterville, Illinois on September 17, 1899. Both before and after the events at Virden, Governor John Riley Tanner ordered the state militia to Pana to keep the peace, as the miners tried to unionize the mine. The militia withdrew from Pana in March, and on April 10, 1899, a skirmish between strikers, guards and strikebreakers left seven killed and at least 15 wounded, many of them bystanders.No primary source refers to fatal labor strife in Pana in 1902, although this date is sometimes cited. http://www.lib.niu.edu/2006/iht1320610.html At Lauder a group of African- American miners traveling by train from Pana were attacked on June 30, 1899. A woman bystander, Anna Karr, was shot and killed, and about twenty other persons wounded. At Carterville on September 17, union miners rioted against black strikebreakers, and five non-union miners were killed. Local juries acquitted all those accused in those attacks.Bloody Williamson: A Chapter in American Lawlessness By Paul M.

It lies between Toddington and Winchcombe stations.  History  On 9 July 1859, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened a line from to . The OW&W; became the West Midland Railway in 1860 and was acquired by Great Western Railway in 1883 with a view to combining it with the Birmingham to Stratford Line to create a high-speed route from the Midlands to the South West. The GWR obtained authorisation in 1899 for the construction of a double-track line between Honeybourne and Cheltenham and this was completed in stages by 1908. Hayles Abbey Halt was opened on 24 September 1928. Situated from Honeybourne East Loop, the station consisted of two facing platforms constructed of sleepers, on each of which was a small corrugated iron passenger waiting shelter. Footpaths from the adjacent road led to the platforms which were lit by oil lamps maintained by porters at whose stationmaster had overall responsibility for the station. The provision of the halt coincided with the opening of a museum at nearby Hailes Abbey, a ruined Cistercian abbey founded in 1246 by Richard of Cornwall. By July 1932, the station was served by six daily railmotor services from to Cheltenham and back, plus one Honeybourne to and back. The Sunday offering consisted of two services from Honeybourne to Cheltenham and back. Nearly 30 years later, the final timetable for Hayles Abbey Halt showed the same service pattern, the only difference being an additional service to Honeybourne on weekdays. The station closed on 7 March 1960, the same day on which the local passenger service was withdrawn from the Honeybourne Line. Present day The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway (GWSR) have reopened the line through Hayles Abbey Halt, with the first services between Toddington and Winchcombe running on 2 August 1987. It is just a half mile from Hailes Abbey itself, protected by English Heritage. Although a new halt was planned on the site in 1998, this did not materialise. In March 2015, it was reported that the board of the GWSR had authorised the reconstruction of the station to a design to match the original. However, unlike the original, only a single two-coach platform will be provided on the Cotswolds side of the line. In June 2016, it was confirmed that a corrugated iron shelter, recovered from Usk and similar to the one originally at Hayles Abbey Station, would be erected. By January 2017, work was finally underway on the reconstruction of Hayles Abbey Halt, which has a single platform. The halt finally reopened as a request stop on 5 June 2017. There are no parking facilities at the station.

They were established as a small performing group in 1959 by Mary Bee Jensen and have grown to include around 180 participants. However, about 30 of the dancers participate in the touring ensemble which has performed in many locations around the world including at the cultural festival held in connection with the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea and at the opening ceremonies in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. History The BYU International Folk Dance Ensemble was established in 1956 by Mary Bee Jensen when she was asked to organize Scandinavian dances for a congregation meeting of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Janie Thompson, the director of BYU's Young Ambassadors performing group, aided Jensen early on in the development of the program. The ensemble was part of the university's Program Bureau which organized tours and performances of BYU performing groups. The ensemble began with a few couples with Jensen as director. In 1959, the ensemble established the annual \\"Christmas Around the World\\" concert which showcases authentic dances from around the world. Jensen led the folk dancers on their first international tour in 1964 using her own funds, becoming the first student performing group at BYU to tour internationally. The United States People-to-People Organization sent the BYU folk dancers to the International Folk Dance Festival in Varde, Denmark in 1964. In 1969, former performer Don Allen became the assistant director. From 1956 to 1972, they averaged over 100 shows per year. From 1967 to 1973, the ensemble performed two-hour concerts with the ballroom dancers across the United States. During years 1971 and 1972, the folk dancers participated in several performances at prominent locations including a concert in Houston for the American Association of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation convention; a concert in Denver for the International Convention of the Federated Women's Clubs; and a performance at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Additionally, in 1972, two teams of folk dancers participated in tours. The first team produced a television show called \\"America through Dance\\" for German national television in Munich, reaching over 20 million German-speaking viewers. The second team of dancers performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and performed in various folk dance festivals in Europe. The BYU folk dancers sponsored a folk dance festival in 1975 with dancers from Japan, Israel, Hawaii, and the Duquesne University Tamburitzans. Edwin G. Austin became the second director of the dance group, replacing Jensen in 1985. Austin served as the artistic director of the folk dancers from 1985 to 2011. The International Folk Dance Ensemble performed in the opening ceremonies in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, as the only North American representative, and in the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In May 2019, the folk dance ensemble joined other BYU performing groups on BYU Young Ambassadors's 40th anniversary tour of China. The ensemble consists of 180 dancers, 30 of which are on the touring team. The touring team is made up of 46 student dancers, musicians, and technicians. Participants are required to take several technical dancing classes in different international dancing styles. They perform a variety of cultural dancing native to international cultures including Irish stepdance, clogging, hula, and hopak.

This first album to compile the singer's material features his first six songs to make the Billboard Hot 100 along with their corresponding B-sides. In The Music Lover's Guide to Record Collecting, author Dave Thompson writes, \\"Of additional interest among Cadence LPs of this period was [company founder Archie] Bleyer's insistence on adding droll commentaries\\" to the cover design.. For example, the cover for the album Kenneth Patchen Reads His Poetry quotes Bleyer as saying, \\"' Puts muscles in your ears.'\\" Thompson, however, adds that \\"the most bizarre phrase is surely that which attends Andy Williams' Andy Williams album: 'He's All Male and Catnip to Quail,' Says Archie\\".

Time would prove that Williams was at his best in an easy listening ballad mode, a natural successor to Bing Crosby and Perry Como, but in 1956 and 1957 that was a hard sell for a newcomer, and Cadence Records head Archie Bleyer gave Williams a variety of material.\\" Ruhlmann also warned, \\"Anyone accustomed to the later Andy Williams of \\"Moon River\\" may find this album somewhat schizophrenic, but it is an accurate portrait of the successful early days of the singer's career.\\" Track listing Side one # \\"Canadian Sunset\\" (Norman Gimbel, Eddie Heywood) ‚Äì 2:37 #*recorded 7/2/56; Top 100: #8. # \\"I Like Your Kind of Love\\" (Melvin Endsley) ‚Äì 2:30 #*rec. 6/16/57; Top 100: #9 # \\"Walk Hand in Hand\\" (Johnny Cowell) ‚Äì 2:51 #*rec. 3/15/56; Top 100: #54 # \\"Lips of Wine\\" (Sy Soloway, Shirley Wolfe) ‚Äì 1:46 #*rec. 8/6/57; Top 100: #39 # \\"Not Anymore\\" (Bob Terry) ‚Äì 1:59 #*rec. 3/15/56; B-side of \\"Walk Hand in Hand\\" # \\"It Doesn't Take Very Long\\" (Sherman Feller, Kathleen Goodrich) ‚Äì 2:51 #*rec. 1/23/57; B-side of \\"Butterfly\\" Side two # \\"Baby Doll\\" (Bernie Hanighen, Kenyon Hopkins) ‚Äì 2:04 #*rec. 8/30/56; Top 100: #33 # \\"Butterfly\\" (Bernie Lowe, Kal Mann) ‚Äì 2:21 #*rec. 1/23/57; Top 100: #1 (3 weeks) # \\"High upon a Mountain\\" (Jill Jackson, Seymour Miller) ‚Äì 2:48 #*rec. 7/2/56; B-side of \\"Canadian Sunset\\" # \\"Stop Teasin' Me\\" (Y.

B   Bend  A bend is a knot used to join two lengths of rope.  Bight  The alpine butterfly loop is a knot that can be tied on the bight. A bight has two meanings in knotting. It can mean either any central part of a rope (between the standing end and the working end) or an arc in a rope that is at least as wide as a semicircle. \\"Any slack part of a rope between the two ends, particularly when curved or looped.\\" In either case, a bight is a length of rope that does not cross itself. Knots that can be tied without use of the working end are called knots on the bight.  Binding knot  Binding knots are knots that either constrict a single object or hold two objects snugly together. Whippings, seizings and lashings serve a similar purpose to binding knots, but contain too many wraps to be properly called a knot. In binding knots, the ends of rope are either joined together or tucked under the turns of the knot.  Bitter end  Another term for the working end. https://www.nasbla.org/viewdocument/boat-crew-seamanship-manual-comdti  C   Capsizing  The reef knot can capsize if one of its standing ends is pulled. A knot that has capsized or spilled has deformed into a different structure. Although capsizing is sometimes the result of incorrect tying or misuse, it can also be done purposefully in certain cases to strengthen the knot (see the carrick bend) or to untie a seized knot which would otherwise be difficult to release (see reef knot).  Chirality  Chirality is the 'handedness' of a knot. Topologically speaking, a knot and its mirror image may or may not have knot equivalence.  D   Decorative knot  Although primarily tied for decorative purposes, the Turk's head knot can serve as a hand grip when tied around a cylindrical object. A decorative knot is any aesthetically pleasing knot. Although it is not necessarily the case, most decorative knots also have practical applications or were derived from other well-known knots. Decorative knotting is one of the oldest and most widely distributed folk art.  Dressing  Knot dressing is the process of arranging a knot in such a way as to improve its performance. Crossing or uncrossing the rope in a specific way, depending on the knot, can increase the knot's strength as well as reduce its jamming potential.  E   Elbow  An elbow refers to any two nearby crossings of a rope. An elbow is created when an additional twist is made in a loop.  Eye  The 'eye' is in fact what is often (in error) referred to as a 'loop'. The 'eye' functions in the same way as an 'eye bolt' or an 'eye splice'. The 'eye' provides a means to form connections. Note that the 'eye of a knot (or a splice) is fixed and does not slip. If it slipped, it would not function as an eye - it would act like a 'noose'.  F   Flake  A flake refers to any number of turns in a coiled rope. Likewise, to flake a rope means to coil it. \\"Flaking\\" or \\"Faking\\" also means to lay a rope on a surface ready to use or to run out quickly without tangles Figure-8 flake  Fraps  Fraps or \\"frapping turns\\" are a set of loops coiled perpendicularly around the wraps of a lashing as a means of tightening.The rolling hitch is a common type of friction hitch.  Friction hitch  A friction hitch is a knot that attaches one rope to another in a way that allows the knot's position to easily be adjusted. Sometimes friction hitches are called slide-and-grip knots. They are often used in climbing applications.  H   Hitch  A hitch is a knot that attaches a rope to some object, often a ring, rail, spar, post, or perhaps another rope, as in the case of the rolling hitch.  J   Jamming  A jamming knot is any knot that becomes very difficult to untie after use. Knots that are resistant to jamming are called non-jamming knots.  L  A tripod lashing  Lashing  A lashing is an arrangement of rope used to secure two or more items together in a rigid manner. Common uses include the joining of scaffolding poles and the securing of sailing masts. The square lashing, diagonal lashing, and shear lashing are well-known lashings used to bind poles perpendicularly, diagonally, and in parallel, respectively.  Loop  A: open loop, B: closed loop, C: turn, D: round turn, and E: two round turns In reference to knots, loop may refer to: * One of the fundamental structures used to tie knots. Specifically, it is a U-form narrower than a bight.Clifford W. Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots. Image 31, 32. * A type of knot used to create a closed circle in a line. A loop is one of the fundamental structures used to tie knots. It is a full circle formed by passing the working end of a rope over itself. When the legs of a closed loop are crossed to form a loop, the rope has taken a turn.  Loop knot  The bowline is a common loop knot. A loop knot is a type of knot that has a fixed 'eye'. The eye can be formed via 'tying-in-the-bight' (TIB) or by non-TIB methods. An example is the Figure 8 eye knot (ABoK #1047) - which can be tied-in-the-bight to directly form the eye in a 1 stage tying process. However, when attempting to attach the F8 eye knot to a climbing harness or to a tree, the TIB method will not work. Instead, the knot must be tied in a 2 stage tying process by first tying a figure 8 knot (ABoK #570) and then re-threading the tail through and around the #570 F8 knot to re-create the final F8 eye knot (#1047). Unlike a hitch, a loop knot creates a fixed eye in a rope that maintains its structure regardless of whether or not it is fastened to an object. In other words, the 'eye' can be removed from an object without losing its shape. When visualizing the 'eye' of a knot - think in terms of an 'eye bolt' or an 'eye splice'. An eye bolt is not a loop bolt - it is properly referred to as an eye bolt. The same concept applies to an eye splice.  N   Noose  A noose can refer to any sliding loop in which the loop tightens when pulled.  O   Open loop  An open loop is a curve in a rope that resembles a semicircle in which the legs are not touching or crossed. The legs of an open loop are brought together narrower than they are in a bight.  S  The eye of a forestay is secured by three round seizings  Seizing  A seizing is a knot that binds two pieces of rope together side by side, normally in order to create a loop. The structure of seizings is similar to that of lashings.  Setting  Setting a knot is the process of tightening it. Improper setting can cause certain knots to underperform.  Slipped knot  The slipped form of the buntline hitch (on the right) can easily be untied by pulling the hanging end and withdrawing the loop. A slipped knot is any knot that unties when an end is pulled. Thus, tying the slipped form of a knot makes it easier to untie, especially when the knot is prone to jamming.  Small-stuff  Small-stuff is a nautical and knot-tying term for thin string or twine, as opposed to the thick, heavy ropes that are more often used in sailing. It is commonly used in a whipping to bind the ends of ropes to prevent fraying. Historically, the term referred to cordage less than one inch in circumference.Clifford W. Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 603. Much of the small-stuff onboard ships, especially that used for decorative or fancy ropework, was made by the sailors themselves reusing materials unlaid from old and leftover pieces of larger rope and cable.Ashley, 549.  Spilling   Splice  Splicing is a method of joining two ropes done by untwisting and then re-weaving the rope's strands.  Standing end  The standing end (or standing part) of a rope is the part that is not active in knot tying. It is the opposite part in the working end.  Stopper knot  A stopper knot is the type of knot tied to prevent a rope from slipping through a grommet. The overhand knot is the simplest single- strand stopper knot.  T  Turn A turn is one round of rope on a pin or cleat, or one round of a coil.  W   Whipping  A whipping is a binding knot tied around the end of a rope to prevent the rope from unraveling.  Working end  The working end (or working part) of a rope is the part active in knot tying. It is the part opposite of the standing end.

In her early adult years, Milius was active in the Communist Party of the United States and an advocate for social justice. She began her artistic career creating pen and ink portraits of victims of the Great Depression, before proceeding to examine the struggles of the working poor in the towns of the Eastern United States through woodcuts, as well as producing drawings from the sit down strikes in Chicago. An artist and an illustrator, Milius' most notable publications include the illustrations for Dorothy Sterling's Cape Cod natural history book The Outer Lands. In her eighties she wrote and illustrated the women's studies exploration of feminism, sexuality and mythology: The Metamorphosis of Baubo, Myths of Woman's Sexual Energy. She died on January 3, 2012, of congestive heart failure. She was 97. Early life Winifred Milius Lubell was born in New York City to Elsa Simonson and Lester Milius. Wealthy New Yorkers, the Milius' ancestors immigrated to the United States from Bavaria in the 19th-century and made fortunes in Manhattan real estate and textiles. Raised in a German-Jewish family in New York, her parents were conscious of their social status, looking down upon those below them in the social ladder, even as they were set off for their Jewish heritage. Her mother was more liberal than her father and was the younger sister of the noted theatre designer and critic Lee Simonson. This upbringing led to Elsa Simonson socializing with modernist artists such as Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, Florine Stettheimer, and William and Marguerite Zorach. From 1922 to 1932, Milius attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, which contradicted the views of her father by teaching racial equality, social justice and intellectual freedom. Her teachings at Fieldston led her to be called a \\"rebel\\" as a youth, protesting the double standards of the upper class. Artistic career Early days Elsa Simonson was an amateur painter, working out of a large art studio on Riverside Drive at which Winifred began her artistic explorations. In April 1923, Simonson had a solo exhibition as a member of the art co-operative Artists Galleries. That year she also joined the Salons of America, which was formed by Hamilton Easter Field, and others who had left the Society of Independent Artists. She painted floral still lifes, nudes and rural landscapes, exhibiting her work through the 1920s until 1928, when Parkinson's disease caused her to stop painting. Elsa Simonson died in 1933, which led Milius to become more serious about her artistic career. In October 1933 she enrolled in the National Academy of Design to learn figure drawing. Eventually she became frustrated by the strict and conservative nature of the academy. After an instructor told her to concentrate on plaster casts to bring \\"classic dignity\\" to her life drawings, she quit school and declared she was going to move out of New York. Instead of leaving, she took classes at the Art Students League of New York, where students could choose their own classes without strict guidelines. In 1934 she began taking a life drawing class under artist George Grosz. An opportunity to study under Grosz appealed to her due to his leftist ideologies and technical innovations. Despite disappointment in Grosz's political weariness, Milius found influence in Grosz's class trips to the Hooverville shantytowns, where Milius and her classmates documented the plight of the homeless during the Great Depression. The victims and impoverished that she observed would find their way into sketches, which eventually developed into prints. Disappointed with Grosz's lack of political energy, Milius began training under printmaker Harry Sternberg, who she described as a \\"spirited leftist\\". Sternberg was a member of the John Reed Club, and his Marxist beliefs began to influence Milius and her fellow students including Rita Albers, Julien Alberts, Mary Annand, Hugh Miller. Encouraged by Sternberg, the students joined the Artists Union in New York. Milius exhibited her art in union shows, and was one of hundreds who participated in the Rockefeller vandalism protests, which protested the destruction of Diego Rivera's Man at the Crossroads painting. With her political and artistic friends, she frequently visited the New York Public Library print collections, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and New York art galleries. Milius and fellow student Blanche Grambs explored various New York neighborhoods such as the Lower East Side, the waterfront, and SoHo, drawing outside, or going inside to the New York Public Library on cold days. Milius's works of the NYPL depict the buildings use as a shelter for Depression-era victims, reflective of the use of libraries today as an afternoon housing for the poor. In 1935 Milius and Grambs started using the studio of William Karp, creating formal portraits. The two used unemployed men as models, who they would find at Stuyvesant Square; models that would allow the two emerging artists to continue to explore social awareness within their art. Milius' portraits and sketches of this time expressed the failure of Capitalism and the resilience of the working class. After working at Karp's studio for a summer, the two joined an information sketch group that met at Will Barnet's tenement apartment. Milius would make portraits of the children in the neighborhood, and produced a pen-and-ink drawing that would be her first published piece in Marxist publication The New Masses. Industrial themes Coal Gatherers, woodcut, 1937. Milius moved away from urban themes after two years, and in 1936 began introducing industrial themes into her work. That year, Harry Sternberg received a Guggenheim Fellowship to travel to mining and steelmaking centers in the United States, and he brought a group of students with him, including Milius, who visited an anthracite mining town in Lanford, Pennsylvania. The whereabouts of the works that Milius created from this trip are unknown, but, several journals depict studies of Lanford miners preparing for work. Milius stayed with a host-family in Lanford, and was moved by the malnutrition suffered by the family, describing how after dinner, the miner, his wife, and his family \\"crossed to a single sideboard, each in turn taking out their false teeth, which they placed in glasses of water lined in a row, and went straight to bed.\\" Her woodcut, Coal Gatherers, expresses her concerns with the poverty in mining towns, which shows children collecting coal bits from train tracks to bring back to their families for fuel. This piece, designed to bring public awareness to the plight of miners, was included in the American Artists' Congress \\"America Today\\" exhibition, which opened in thirty cities in December 1936. The exhibition was designed to show awareness to social concerns and promote the ability to mass-produce prints in fast and inexpensive manners for wide distribution. Move to Chicago At the end of 1936, Milius moved to Chicago with her first husband, Daniel House, whom she married in 1935. House began law school at the University of Chicago and Milius settled into activities with the Chicago branch of the Artists Union. She befriended Mitchell Siporin, Morris Topchevsky, and Adrian Troy, joining them in their ongoing dispute against the Illinois Art Project (IAP). IAP became a target after issues with dismissals, subject matter censoring, and the rights of the artists to organize. On December 12, 1936, 27 representatives from the Illinois Workers Alliance, the Technical and Research Employees Union, the Adult Teachers' Union and the Artists Union, occupied the IAP headquarters in a sitdown strike. Milius participated in the eight-day sitdown, and her drawings of the event were published in the Chicago Daily News and New Masses. In the spring and summer of 1937, artists' strikes and conflicts with authorities became headline news along with the violent industrial struggles. Milius participated more than ever in the labor movement, and assisted Harry Sternberg in creating the painting Epoch of a Great City, when he came to Lakeview, Illinois to complete the mural at a post office. The two visited stockyards and workers districts, gaining inspiration for the piece. Milius also became active in the Packinghouse Workers Organizing Committee, painting banners, creating illustrations for publications and disturbing those leaflets. Two men with hats, 1937. Winifred Lubell papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Milius' activities within the Communist Party put a strain on her relationship with her husband, who was a Trotskyite, opposed to the Communist Party. Within two years the couple had separated and Milius moved back to New York. Back in the East Returning to New York in 1938, Milius began making contributions to the theater scene. She designed costumes for the Dave Doran Memorial Committee modern dance performance, which served as a fundraiser for Communist Party trade union director Dave Doran, who died in combat as the youngest commander in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. She also designed costumes for a musical called A Song About America, which depicted the Boston Tea Party, the Steel strike of 1919 and other revolutionary American moments. Despite a few experiments, she would not pursue costume design beyond 1939. Milius began spending time at the Fifteenth Street studio, which was shared by Mervin Jules and Axel Horn. A social center for artists, intellectuals and revolutionaries, it was there where she met Cecil Lubell, a Harvard graduate and scholar of William Blake and James Joyce who became an expert on textiles and authored several books and an encyclopedia of textiles. The two had much in common, including the belief that the Communists were the only group addressing the serious problems in society at the time. They were married in Boston in 1939 and moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Shortly after their marriage and move, they collaborated on their first book: Petticoat Picket Lines: The History of Women in the American Labor Movement, which Cecil Lubell wrote and Winifred Milius illustrated. The book was never published due to the onset of World War II. Milius continued to explore gender, race, and class through woodcuts based on historical motifs that depicted the lives of black women abolitionists. In 1941 she exhibited in her fifth Artist's Union exhibit, in Massachusetts, displaying her work Marathon Race, which was described as an \\"amusing bit of abstraction,\\". Post-War Milius and Lubell remained members of the Communist Party of the United States of America until they either were forced to leave (Cecil Lubell) or left of their own accord after the Kruschov speech of 1956 (Winifred), but nonetheless they and their family were affected by the Red Scare Cold War policies. In 1956, Cecil Lubell was subpoenaed by the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Senator James O. Eastland to testify against friend and neighbor Joseph North. Lubell did not incriminate his friend and neighbor, denying any knowledge of North and his involvement within the Communist Party. During this time, Milius began illustrating more books. She co-created, with Lubell, a series of children's books about animals, natural history, plants and ecosystems. Political activity Milius has been active in the Artists Union, the American Artists' Congress and the Communist Party of America. During the Depression era, she participated in activities and events surrounding federal support for the arts, Congress of Industrial Organizations efforts to establish racially integrated labor unions, and the Loyalists opposition in the Spanish Civil War. Becoming active during her college years, inspired by professor Harry Sternberg. Milius had close artist friends who also joined the ranks of leftist politics, such as Edward Jacobs and Blanche Grambs, whose relationships were solidified with politics and art. She described Communism as an \\"absolutely wonderful thing,\\" upon discovering it in the early 1930s. While in Chicago, she became active in the organized labor movement, and also contributed to awareness about the Loyalists movement against Francisco Franco in Spain. Block prints by her and other Chicago area artists were included in the book For Spain and Liberty, where Milius expressed \\"solidarity with all who combat those forces with burned books in Germany, plundered Ethiopia, made shambles of Guernica, and everywhere imperil the minority peoples of the earth.\\" As of 2005, Milius still believed that poor party leadership led to the failure of Communist ideals. She does not regret her participation in the movement, and says it opened her eyes towards the diversity and complex issues within the world. In the 1970s, after moving permanently to Wellfleet, Massachusetts, Milius and Lubell founded a Cape Cod chapter of Amnesty International and became active supporters of the Wellfleet Public Library. Writing Hathor in the Sacred Fig Tree, white line color woodcut, 1984‚Äì85 Beginning in the 1940s, Milius wrote and or illustrated over 50 books. In 1994 she published The Metamorphosis of Baubo, Myths of Woman's Sexual Energy. In her late seventies she learned ancient Greek, and in her eighties she translated Batrachomyomachia. Legacy In 1995 a selection of Milius' illustrations and sketches were donated to the Andersen Library at the University of Minnesota. In 2003 Milius donated her papers to the Archives of American Art. Following her death, the remainder of her children's book material was donated to the Kerlan Collection in Minnesota, and her artwork and wood blocks to the Rutgers University Libraries in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Family In 1935 Milius married her first husband, Daniel House, a law student at the University of Chicago; the couple would live in Chicago and divorce in 1938. She met and married her second husband, English-born writer and textile expert Cecil Lubell (1912‚Äì2000) in 1939. The couple shared interests in mythology, psychology, linguistics, and specifically the history and visual styles of written language. They are survived by two sons: David (born 1942), an archaeologist in Waterloo, Canada, and Stephen (born 1945), a typographer and typographic historian in London, UK, grandchildren Naomi, Michal, Anne, Christopher and Claire, and two great grandchildren Ilai and Libby.

() is a fabless semiconductor design company, focusing on low- power, high-definition (HD) and Ultra HD video compression, image processing, and computer vision processors. Ambarella's products are used in a wide variety of human and computer vision applications, including video security, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), electronic mirror, drive recorder, driver and in-cabin monitoring, autonomous driving, and robotics applications. Ambarella's system on chips (SoCs) are designed to deliver a combination of video compression, image processing, and computer vision performance with low- power operation to enable cameras to extract data from high-resolution video streams.  History  Ambarella was founded in 2004 by Feng-Ming (Fermi) Wang and Les Kohn with the goal of developing high-definition H.264 video encoders for the professional broadcast market. Soon after, Ambarella applied this same technology to consumer video and security IP camera markets, focusing on the development of low-power, compression-efficient chips capable of producing high-quality imagery in challenging lighting and high-motion environments. Over the next decade, Ambarella chips were featured in a number of notable consumer camera products, including the GoPro Hero, the Dropcam by Nest, and the DJI Phantom series of drones. In July 2015 Ambarella acquired VisLab, a pioneer in perception systems and autonomous vehicle research founded by Professor Alberto Broggi. VisLab has a history of developing computer vision and intelligent control systems for automotive and commercial applications, including ADAS and autonomous vehicles. Subsequent generations of Ambarella SoCs incorporated VisLab perception technologies at the hardware level, with the goal of targeting automotive OEM camera designs across all of SAE‚Äôs six levels of driving automation (ranging from fully manual to fully automated or ‚Äústeering wheel optional‚Äù).  Technologies  Ambarella develops intelligent embedded processors for a range of camera markets‚Äîincluding security, wearable, drone, sports/action, and automotive‚Äîwith an emphasis on several core technologies. Dedicated Hardware Architecture for Computer Vision Known as CVflow¬Æ, Ambarella‚Äôs computer vision architecture includes a dedicated hardware engine programmed with a high-level algorithm description, allowing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with industry-standard tools (such as Caffe and TensorFlow) to be mapped onto CVflow-based chips. This approach represents a marked difference from that of general-purpose architectures, such as those offered by GPUs and CPUs, which are popular alternatives for computer vision processing. Stereovision While Ambarella chips are capable of monocular processing, stereovision is a key focus area for the company. Using cameras with multiple lenses and image sensors, Ambarella‚Äôs stereovision processing enables the capture of three-dimensional imagery via the simulation of binocular vision, making it possible to detect generic obstacles that a perception system hasn‚Äôt been trained to recognize. This generic 3D obstacle detection can be valuable when deployed in partial or fully autonomous robotics applications where atypical objects may be encountered. Edge Design In contrast to cloud-dependent hardware technologies, Ambarella‚Äôs technologies are designed for use in edge applications, where a significant share of the processing is performed locally, onboard the device. To meet the demands of processing at the edge, Ambarella products prioritize low power consumption, reduced physical footprint, and extended operating temperature ranges. Image Processing Ambarella processors include specialized digital image processing hardware to convert raw image sensor data into color- corrected imagery, removing noise to improve quality in various lighting conditions, as well as performing lens distortion correction, digital image stabilization, and high dynamic range (HDR) processing.

Her compositions blend jazz and blues with minimalism, classical, and avant-garde music. Since the early 2000s she has recorded with Antonio S√°nchez, Larry Grenadier, Christian McBride, and Sean Jones.  Early years  Hilton was born in San Luis Obispo, a small town on California's central coast. Her father was a college professor and her mother was an accountant. At approximately the age of six, she began playing piano, first teaching herself to play with a colored keyboard guide and composing simple songs. Later she was inspired by stories of her great uncle, Dutch pianist Willem Bloemendaal. Although her early years were dominated by classical music and 20th-century music study, in her teens she became interested in jazz and blues. Seeing the blues duo Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee in concert had a lasting impact, as did the music of Jelly Roll Morton, Robert Johnson, and Muddy Waters. She played piano for her grammar school glee club starting in third grade, later joining orchestra and band on flute, and performed piano scores for high school musicals. Hilton moved to San Francisco. As a college student who studied art, she put music aside to complete a degree in art and design. After returning to music, she was drawn to jazz. She often mentions that she draws on her background in art to create compositions, painting and sculpting her compositions with ideas from music.  Return to the piano  In 1997, Hilton's interest in music was reignited by a neighbor, pianist David Foster. She resumed her studies in theory and composition with composer Charles Bernstein at UCLA. Her first album, Seduction (1997), was just solo piano. Since then she has recorded about one album a year. The albums include cover tunes by musicians such as Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, and Ann Ronell. Hilton began working in 2005 with the engineer Al Schmitt. They have continued working together, with Doug Sax, Gavin Lurssen, Fernando Lodeiro, Larry Mah, and James Farber. She has produced every album and has been a voting member of the Producers and Engineers Wing of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) since 2003.  Compositions  Hilton has received acclaim for her compositions. She cites Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Horace Silver as her most important compositional influences. Hilton uses improvisation, free jazz, and shifting modal key centers for impressionistic compositions like \\"When it Rains.\\" She use ideas from other art forms. \\"French composers like Debussy used harmonic 'impressionism,' but I like to use improvisational ideas in an impressionistic way,\\" she told Phil Freeman of Burning Ambulance. \\"Seurat's pointillism technique is something I have applied to music, for example.\\" \\"Music feels like my first language,\\" she added. \\"It feels like I can create an experience compositionally that allows others to also feel that experience, much like a good writer being able to describe love, or a painter or photographer creating an image. I think I can compose and play the sound of twilight, of a warm summer's day, of love or grief, of a subway or dolphins even. I think of my ‚Äì and our ‚Äì music as abstract or non-figurative paintings.\\" Hilton ventures into longer musical forms, fusing jazz onto classical forms, as in \\"Midnight Sonata\\" from her album Nocturnal. On Escapism her arrangements paired modern jazz modalities and classical techniques with a \\"lofty sophistication reminiscent of classic piano music from Beethoven, Chopin, or Stravinsky.\\".  Later life and career  As a bandleader, Hilton has worked with bassists Christian McBride, Luques Curtis, and Larry Grenadier, drummers Antonio Sanchez, Nasheet Waits, Rudy Royston, Billy Hart, and Lewis Nash, trumpeters Sean Jones and Terrell Stafford, and saxophonists J. D. Allen, Steve Wilson, Brice Winston, and Bobby Militello. In the book The New Face of Jazz, author Cicily Janus writes that Hilton has been \\"compared to some of the best pianists in history\\" ‚Äì comparisons often include Bill Evans and Dave Brubeck, but Hilton's compositions are also considered to be reminiscent of musical impressionism inspired by Claude Debussy and Erik Satie.  Publishing  Inspired by Joni Mitchell, Hilton started a publishing company that was trademarked Lisa Hilton Music. Her record label, Ruby Slippers Productions was established in 2001. She is a voting member of National Music Publishers Association.  Inspiration  For over twenty years, Hilton has lived in Malibu, California. She has often said that the mountains, waterfalls, and beaches inspire her compositions, such as \\"The Sky and the Ocean\\" from Horizons. The daughter of a biology professor, she values nature and brings it into her compositions, as in the titles \\"Vapors & Shadows\\" from Oasis, \\"Mojave Moon\\" from Escapism, and \\"Sunset on the Beach\\" from Day and Night.  Philanthropy  Hilton supports music programs for children and teens, particularly the blind or visually impaired. She has performed benefit concerts, conducted workshops, and played with young musicians at Perkins School for the Blind, Chicago Lighthouse Junior Blind of America and their Camp Bloomfield in Malibu, and the Adaptive Technology Lab at Berklee College of Music in Boston.

It is the third film in the Krrish series, following Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) and Krrish (2006). The film stars Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi, Priyanka Chopra and Kangana Ranaut. The story follows the life of Rohit Mehra, a scientist, and Krishna Mehra, a.k.a. Krrish, his superhero son, who face an elaborate conspiracy orchestrated by the evil genius Kaal and his female henchman Kaya. In the process, Krishna's pregnant wife Priya is kidnapped by Kaal and the form- changing Kaya takes her place at the Mehra home and eventually falls in love with Krishna. Krrish 3 was initially scheduled to release as a 3D film. However, due to lack of time to convert the film to 3D, director Rakesh Roshan mentioned that the film will be released only in the 2D format. Krrish 3 released worldwide on 1 November 2013. Produced on a budget of (), the film grossed () worldwide. It has received generally positive reviews, with praise for Roshan and Ranaut's performances, the visual effects, the cinematography, and entertainment value, but with criticism of the music by Rajesh Roshan, the story, and the screenplay. Plot Scientist Rohit Mehra lives with his son Krishna Mehra (both played by Hrithik Roshan) in Mumbai. Krishna is married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra), a journalist for Aaj Tak. Rohit works in a research institute for the Indian government and Krishna, while moonlighting as the superhero Krrish, is regularly fired from various day jobs due to lack of attendance. Rohit is researching on a device that will bring life to dead tissues by the use of solar energy. Despite several attempts, he fails to complete the experiment due to the high intensity of sun rays. On a usual day, Krishna loses his job from the security wing of a company when he hears news about an aeroplane whose front tyres are stuck due to some malfunctioning which creates high risk, even if landed, it may explode and so will the passengers inside. Krishna immediately changes himself to Krrish and saves the plane from accident by holding the landing gear in place to allow the tyres to support the nose of the craft. A few days later, Rohit hears about a deadly disease spreading in Namibia due to a virus whose antidote has not yet been discovered. He consults his friend Dr. Varun Shetty (Arif Zakaria) about the situation. Meanwhile, Shetty receives a phone call from Dr. Alok Sen (Asif Basra), a scientist working for Kaal Laboratories who insists on meeting him in order to reveal information about the virus and its antidote. Both Sen and Shetty are, however, murdered by Kaya (Kangana Ranaut), a shapeshifting female mutant. She is the henchwoman of Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), a handicapped evil genius who possesses telekinetic powers. Kaal creates a team of human-animal hybrids called \\"maanvars\\", with distinct physical powers in order to cure himself but fails. Later it is revealed the virus in Namibia was spread by Kaal himself to incur huge profits by selling its antidote, the singular source of which is his blood. Rohit discovers that the virus, which is fast spreading through Mumbai, has no effect on Krishna, the pregnant Priya or himself. He, thus, makes an antidote by using the blood from Krishna's bloodstream which he spreads with the help of explosions. An enraged Kaal sends his mutants to attack Rohit and find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood. Krrish manages to save Rohit, but Priya is injured and hospitalised. Krrish, however, manages to defeat the mutant Striker (Gowhar Khan). Kaya, carrying out Kaal's instructions, shapeshifts into Priya while Priya is kidnapped by Kaal. Posing as Priya, Kaya leads Krishna to believe that Priya has lost her child, and continues to live with the Mehras. While finding the truth behind the antidote's formula she develops an attraction towards Krishna. Failing to get answers about Frog Man's involvement with the virus attack, Rohit travels to Singapore to seek answers from Dr. Siddhant Arya's (Naseeruddin Shah) partner, where he is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Meanwhile, Krishna discovers the true identity of Priya; furious, he reveals himself as Krrish to Kaya and orders her to take him to Kaal's laboratory. Having fallen in love with Krishna, Kaya decides to help rescue his wife. At Kaal's laboratory, it is revealed that Kaal is Rohit's son, who was created by an experiment conducted by Dr. Arya while Rohit was held hostage by him years earlier. The child was born handicapped, and was thus given away to an orphanage from where he was adopted by a wealthy man (Mohnish Behl). Kaal uses Rohit's bone marrow to successfully cure his handicap. Meanwhile, Kaya saves Priya and unites her with Krrish; she is, however, murdered by Kaal for her disloyalty. Kaal subsequently murders Krrish, and dons a metal suit. Deeply disturbed by his son's death, Rohit decides to re- use his failed experiment to bring dead tissues to life in order to save Krishna. This time, however, he absorbs the excess energy himself. The process simultaneously kills Rohit and transfers his powers to a revived Krishna. Meanwhile, Kaal threatens to destroy the city of Mumbai if Priya does not surrender to him. Krrish re-emerges and, after several unsuccessful attempts, manages to kill him using Rohit's solar experiment. Six months later, Priya names their new-born son Rohit, who also exhibits superpowers.

Hrithik Roshan confirmed in an interview to Rediff.com that on similar lines as with the Rambo franchise (where the first film was named First Blood, then came Rambo and then Rambo 3), the film will be called Krrish 3. Rakesh Roshan also clarified the title to Bollywood Hungama. In an interview director Rakesh Roshan said \\"I can't reveal the budget of the movie, but it has been a very costly film\\". The film was reportedly produced on a budget of (). Red Chillies VFX, a subdivision of Shah Rukh Khan's motion picture production banner Red Chillies Entertainment, worked on the special effects worth for Krrish 3. The filming process was completed in June 2012, and then the VFX team started their work. Filming Sphinx Observatory at the Alps, portrayed as Kaal's laboratory in the film Principal photography began on 1 December 2011 with Vivek Oberoi, Kangana Ranaut and Priyanka Chopra. However, Hrithik Roshan did not participate in the first schedule due to a back injury. The primary location of filming was Filmistan Studios at Mumbai. Actress Shaurya Chauhan had an accident while shooting for the film in Hyderabad, due to which the film had to face some delays. On 29 August 2012, it was reported that, the makers had decided the superhero to indulge in the action sequences in snowy terrains. So, some part of the film was shot in Alps, Switzerland. Filming also took place in Jordan where a song featuring Roshan and Ranaut was shot. Rakesh Roshan stated in an interview that the shooting of Krrish 3 was completed by June 2013 with the VFX took one and half years to complete with the last of them coming on 22 October 2013, just 10 days before the release of the film with each and every VFX action sequence undergoing a revision of 40 to 50 times before inclusion. Casting Following the success of the previous instalments, director Rakesh Roshan planned to develop a second sequel to the franchise, with Hrithik Roshan playing the protagonist again. He had penned the script, but had to re-work it as the storyline was too similar to the Hollywood blockbuster Spider-Man 3. Priyanka Chopra was later confirmed to reprise the role of Priya. In this film, she will be seen married to Krishna Mehra. Next, Chitrangada Singh announced her inclusion in the project as a mutant but left the film due to unspecified reasons. Later on, Jacqueline Fernandez was signed but she later on backed out of the film due to a lack of dates. It was reported that actresses Nargis Fakhri, Esha Gupta and Bipasha Basu were to replace Fernandez. Finally, Kangana Ranaut was confirmed to play the role, who coincidentally was originally offered the role. Rakesh Roshan had earlier revealed to media that the main antagonist of film would be as powerful as the hero. After talks with Ajay Devgn and Shah Rukh Khan fell through, Vivek Oberoi was eventually cast for the role. In an interview with Bollywood News Service, Oberoi said, \\"Kaal is contrary to my nature. I am very friendly and Kaal isn't,\\" and added, \\"He has anger and vengeance burning within him; he hates humanity. To express these emotions through my eyes was difficult.\\" In January 2011, Lakshmi Manchu claimed to have been offered a role in the film as the antagonist's girlfriend. Its overseas distribution rights were sold to Eros International while Rakesh Roshan retained rights in Mumbai. There was also initial speculation that Rekha would play a major role in the film, which was later denied as a rumour. Design and costumes For the cast's costumes, Rakesh Roshan involved with designer Gavin Miguel. Roshan wanted light and flexible costume to allow Kangana Ranaut to do her stunts without any restrictions where he stated \\"She has a lot of toughness in her personality. So instead of looking at feminine superheroes for reference, I looked at Batman\\". It took three and half hours to apply Ranaut's makeup everyday. Oberoi is dressed in metal suit weighing around 28 kilograms, which required about 2‚Äì3 hours and 7-8 workers to fix on body. Soundtrack The songs of the film are being composed by Rajesh Roshan at Krishna Audio; whilst the background score is being composed by Salim-Sulaiman. The music rights of the film were acquired by T-Series for . The full soundtrack album was released on 18 September 2013 with music composed by Rakesh Roshan. Marketing Promotions for the movie started post July 2013 and the first look of Krrish 3 was unveiled online. Response for the poster was quite enthusiastic from the audience. The first trailer video was published by film makers on their official YouTube channel on 5 August 2013. It received more than 2.3 million views at YouTube within its first day of release and thereby surpassing the record held by Jab Tak Hai Jaan of 1 million views in one day. Krrish 3 trailer became the most watched Bollywood trailer on YouTube with 12 million views within two weeks, even eclipsing the trailers for such Hollywood superhero blockbusters as Thor (2011) and The Avengers (2012). Press reaction has been positive to the teaser trailer with many stating it echoes the look of recent superhero movies from Hollywood such as Iron Man 3, the Amazing Spider-Man and Man of Steel. Author of Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar wrote on his blog that such comparisons were unfair given they were based on comic books and intellectual properties that had been developed over decades. He commented that Krrish was very much an original character created by Rakesh Roshan and developed by Filmkraft and so the film and character deserved credit for setting a new standard for an original superhero which has not been seen elsewhere in the world. He also stated that no other filmmaker in India or elsewhere has managed to achieve what Rakesh Roshan and Hrithik Roshan have in completely creating a new character and comes out with a hugely successful franchise that is original and has fueled a fanfare similar to those of comic book heroes yet with Krrish's story still being written with each film. Krrish 3 was the first Indian film to launch its own official Facebook Emoticons as part of promotion. An official Krrish 3 game was launched for Windows smartphones, tablets and PCs. The game was developed by Hungama Digital Media Entertainment and Gameshastra. Release The film was previously expected to release on 4 November 2013 but was brought forward to a 1 November, Diwali release. Krrish 3 released in over 4000 screens worldwide (3500 screens in India) and nearly 600 screens in key circuits overseas. The film saw its release in around 750 screens in the South India. Particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Krrish 3 was shown in over 425 screens with the highest being in Nizam, where released in more than 175 screens. The film was dubbed in Telugu and Tamil for release in South Indian states. The distributors of the film released the film in 150-200 screens in the TN and Kerala circuits. The satellite rights were sold to Sony Entertainment Television (India) for  Copyright litigation  Uday Singh Rajput, a writer from Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh moved the Bombay High Court alleging copyright violation of the script of Krrish 3 and seeking a stay on the all India release of the film and claiming 20 million compensation. But, the High Court refused to grant relief to the writer. Critical reception Krrish 3 has received generally positive reviews, with an average 69% Rotten Tomatoes score based on the 13 reviews. Critics directed praise towards Roshan and Ranaut's performances, the visual effects, the cinematography, and entertainment value, while criticism has been directed towards the film's lack of originality, music provided by composer and the director's brother Rajesh Roshan, the story, and screenplay. India Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated that \\"the film has all the ingredients that make a splendid superhero film, besides being Rakesh Roshan's most accomplished work so far.\\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of Times of India gave it 4.5 stars while commenting \\"For sheer vision, bravado and superlative execution, this one soars to new orbits. Latch on to this cape for an exhilarating ride.\\" Raedita Tandan of Filmfare awarded it 4 out of 5 stars, remarking \\"Hats off to Rakesh Roshan for dreaming big and actually pulling off this risky proposition.

Krrish 3 is ambitious and exciting.\\" Sarita Tanwar of DNA gave it 3.5 stars and wrote, \\"Krrish 3 is fast-paced and the VFX effects are smashing.\\" Rohit Khilnani of India Today gave it 3.5 stars noting, \\"The only part where the movie dips is during the songs. The music sounds too dated for this action packed film.\\" The professional review by the critic board of Box Office India magazine found Krrish 3 an industry-defining event movie, stating: \\"Krrish 3 is not only a BIG film but transcends expectations. The film makes you proud how far we, as a film industry, have come. It also makes a bold statement that our industry is at par with Hollywood when it comes to special effects. Rakesh Roshan has incorporated everything a Hindi cine-goer could hope for in this production. It is commercial cinema at its best, with exquisite flavours of action, drama, emotion and thrills. And stitching it all together is content that provides a wide enough canvas that has something for everyone in every age group.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 out of 5 and stated \\"I'm going with two-and-a-half stars for the film, and an additional half star just for Hrithik Roshan, which makes it three out of five for Krrish 3. The film is ambitious but flawed. It is, however, consistently watchable for its terrific lead star who you can't take your eyes off, even for a moment\\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave it 3 out of 5 stars, while adding, \\"Krrish 3 is a outrageous mishmash of Bollywood sentimentality meets E.T. meets Superman meets X-Men with set pieces, sound design and screenplay structure liberally borrowed from Hollywood's imagination.\\" Aparna Mudi of Zee News rated the film 3 stars saying, \\"'Krrish 3' has all the elements of an entertainer and a lot of potential to have given some serious competition to Hollywood flicks.\\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2.5 stars stating, \\"Krrish 3 is, for the most part, impressively ambitious and dazzlingly competent, if not always riveting.\\" Karan Anshuman of Mumbai Mirror gave it 2.5 stars and stated that Krrish 3 is a film for kids. Mohar Basu of Koimoi gave it 2 stars only and stated that Krrish 3 has absolutely no screenplay with poor acting and over the top dialogue. Shubhra Gupta of Indian Express gave it 2 stars out of 5. Mihir Phadnavis of Firstpost stated that \\"Krrish 3 is the most superficial components of X-Men, Batman, Superman, Spiderman and even Shaktimaan stuffed together.\\" Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com panned the film, and gave it \\"no stars\\" saying, \\"Krrish 3 is astonishingly eager to entertain with its stock of doodads that should amuse if not endear\\". Overseas Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of the Dawn gave Krrish 3 a rating of 3/5 stars stating that \\"so most of it is tiringly clich√©d, ripped off from Marvel and DC comics (Krrish's Superman worship is rather blatant) and stick-glued together, it is startling when director Rakesh Roshan's underlying Bollywood-emotionalism compensates the flimsiness of the awkward superhero element from his last film\\". He closes by saying that the film \\"is family-friendly stereotypical entertainment\\". David Chute for the Variety, applauded Krrish 3 as \\"a charming Bollywood superhero movie\\" from a different perspective and applauded the heart and upbeat spirit of the movie for \\"not being an audience-pummeling industrial product like most of Hollywood's superhero films.\\" He loved the way Krrish 3 \\"has the off-hand, anything-is-possible spirit of a children's book or fairy tale.\\" Lisa Tsering writing for The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review saying that \\"the musical superhero extravaganza is too scary for young viewers and too long-winded for everybody else\\". She continues that the \\"effort is admirable and the effects are certainly adequate, but can't compensate for uninteresting, drawn out action scenes; childish logic and uneven acting, especially by Hrithik Roshan, who as Rohit mouth-breathes and toddles around with his head cocked to one side. Worst of all, the movie is devoid of that one secret ingredient that makes audiences love superhero films: It just isn't cool.\\" Box office Krrish 3 had a final worldwide gross of ().

It is distinguished mainly by its expressive and lively tempo, played usually in , although some variants are performed in other time signatures. There are also variant types of mui√±eira which remain in the tempo of but which displace the accent in different ways. Mui√±eira is associated with traditional choreographic schemes and the associated instrumentation is a form of bagpipe known as a gaita. It is subject to highly varied interpretation in differing local traditions. According to \\"Galicia-The Spanish Cousins\\", an article on Roots World,RootsWorld: Galicia - the Spanish Cousins mui√±eira is the Galician \\"equivalent\\" of a jig, which is consistent with the time signature of . The word \\"mui√±eira\\" (the same pronunciation in Portuguese, but spelled \\"moinheira\\") means literally both millstone and a mill landlady (or the miller's wife, if a man). Galician music is classified as part of Celtic music.  Characteristics of the mui√±eira It is a dance of playful character, with a social component expressing gallantry. It is somewhat more permissive of improvisation than other folk dances; improvised in fiestas and exhibitions. Some interpreters have added increased complexity to its traditional choreography. It is played at a fast tempo. Dancers often form a circle or parallel threes. Often jumps are incorporated, synchronized with percussion accompaniment: a snare-drum known as the tamboril (a wooden natural-skinned drum with gut snares), and the bombo, a bass drum. Examples of the genre recommended by native Spanish commentators Galatian language CCL 2.0 editors at Galician Wikipedia include ' ' Mui√±eira de Chantada' ' and to ' ' Mui√±eira de Lugo' '. Notable performers Carlos N√∫√±ez According to RootsWorldRootsWorld home page\\"the most prominent gaita virtuoso in Galicia, and one of the world's best, is Carlos N√∫√±ez. He often tours and records with The Chieftains, who consider him an auxiliary member of the group\\". N√∫√±ez performed a \\"Muneira de Chantada\\" with the Chieftains in early 2008, which featured Irish foot dancing.Roughly translated, it says: like the Druids of Britain we asked to him to God or the Gods that dance of the happiness immersed in that state forever in one eternal celebration, by the pipe of Peace, culture and love. Susana Seivane Susana Seivane playing the gaita Susana Seivane Hoyo (born 25 August 1976) is a Galician gaita (bagpipes) player born in Barcelona, Spain, into a family of well-known Galician luthiers and musicians, the Seivane family, whose workshop is the Obradoiro de Gaitas Seivane. She started her musical career at the age of three. Guided by her father √Ålvaro Seivane and influenced by skilled bagpipers such as her grandfather Xos√© Manuel Seivane, Ricardo Portela and Moxenas, she is notable in the bagpipe world and the world of traditional Galician music. She synthesizes the \\"enxebre\\" style of the ancient bagpipers while creating her own style including other musical influences. Instrumentation Galician bagpipes come in three main varieties, though there are exceptions and unique instruments. These include the tumbal (B-flat), grileira (D) and redonda (C). Asturian bagpipes are usually played along with a tambor (snare drum). Asturian bagpipes usually have only one drone and follow a different fingering pattern.

The concept of Befehlsnotstand was successfully used as a defence in World War II-related war crimes trials in Germany in the 1950s and 1960s but research into the subject since has proven that Befehlsnotstand as such did not exist, meaning German soldiers of the Wehrmacht or SS did not actually face drastic consequences if refusing such an order during the war. Refusing a lawful order did however result in consequences, with 23,000 German soldiers executed for refusing orders. Etymology Befehlsnotstand is a compound word, made up of the German words Befehl (command or order) and Notstand (emergency). The term has been translated into English by various sources as \\"necessity to obey order\\", \\"a compulsion to obey orders\\" or \\"crisis created as a result of following orders\\". Notstand in German law can be compared to necessity in the criminal law of other nations. Germany Background In German law, the situation Befehlsnotstand arises when a person refusing to carry out an unlawful order faces drastic consequences for the refusal. In such a situation, the person could not be prosecuted for carrying out the order. Drastic consequences, in German law, are defined as a danger to life or body, and are not defined as loss of rank, incarceration or removal to a penal unit, such as a Strafbataillon. Nazi Germany The term is commonly, but not exclusively, associated with German war crimes and the Holocaust during World War II, following which Befehlsnotstand was used as line of defence by the accused in post-war trials. In the 1950s and 1960s the use of Befehlsnotstand as a defence in war crimes trials in Germany was quite successful as it generally protected the accused from punishment. With the formation of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, this changed after historical research by the organisation regarding Einsatzgruppen of the Sicherheitsdienst or concentration camp personnel revealed that no known case could be cited where refusing an order did indeed result in severe punishment. More commonly, military personnel refusing such an order were transferred to a different unit. An example for this was Wehrmacht Captain Otto Freyer, who was transferred towards the end of the war to the Neuengamme concentration camp. Freyer was deemed too soft for his role, which included supervision of executions and commanding a sub-camp at Kaltenkirchen, and he was eventually transferred again at his own request. In practice, refusing a superior order to participate in war crimes by German soldiers almost never led to dire consequences for the refusing person, and punishment, if any, was relatively mild. It usually resulted in degradation and being sent to serve with fighting units at the front. German historian Sven Felix Kellerhoff argued that, instead of fear of punishment the participants were more afraid of peer pressure and the possibility of exclusion from their group. Kellerhoff further argued that the situation of Einsatzgruppen members taking part in massacres did not even constitute the lesser Putativnotstand, a state where the individual mistakenly believes their life is in danger if the order is disobeyed when, in reality, no such danger exists. Manfred Oldenburg, in his book Ideology and Military Calculation, stated that there are no known cases where the refusal to participate in an execution of civilians has led to drastic consequences for soldiers of the Wehrmacht or SS. German soldiers did however face drastic consequences if refusing legal orders during the war.Messerschmidt, W√ºllner: Die Wehrmachtjustiz im Dienste des Nationalsozialismus.

Current German law In current German law, articles ¬ß 34 and ¬ß 35 of the German penal code, the Strafgesetzbuch, govern the law on Notstand. Formerly it was governed by articles ¬ß 52 and 54. Article 34 deals with Rechtfertigender Notstand, necessity as justification, while article 35 deals with Entschuldigender Notstand, necessity as excuse.van Sliedregt, 2012, Notes 162 & 163 In other countries Argentina The Law of Due Obedience (), a law passed by the National Congress of Argentina after the end of the military dictatorship, translated in German as the Befehlsnotstandsgesetz (Gesetz meaning law in German), protected all officers and their subordinates of the armed forces and security forces from prosecution for most crimes committed during the dictatorship but was eventually annulled in 2005.

These systems provided automated dimensional measurement, defect detection, alignment and quality control capabilities. They were used primarily in the Semiconductor device fabrication, Integrated circuit packaging, Printed circuit board, Computer data storage and Precision assembly / fabrication industries. VIEW's systems used video and laser technologies to perform their functions without touching the parts being examined. History VIEW Engineering's Logo, circa 1976 VIEW Engineering's Logo, circa 1996 While working as a physicist at Hughes Aircraft Company, Dick Hubach recognized a need for automated dimensional measurement systems, when he discovered that the cost to verify the correct manufacture of some aerospace components actually exceeded the cost to manufacture those components. This recognition led to a new start-up company named VIEW Engineering. VIEW Engineering was founded in Canoga Park, California in 1976. The next year, VIEW introduced the word's first automated, 3-axis, machine vision-based, dimensional measurement system ‚Äì the RB-1. The RB-1 was the forerunner of modern machine vision-based Coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs). This was followed in 1978 by the introduction of the first pattern recognition (Template matching) system for automated Wirebonding machines and Wafer probers ‚Äì the PR-1. As the company's business increased, VIEW Engineering relocated to a facility in Chatsworth, California in late 1977 and again to Simi Valley, California in 1981. General Motors Corporation invested in VIEW Engineering in 1984 as part of its plan to improve automobile manufacturing quality in the U.S. through widespread use of factory floor machine vision technology. In 1989, VIEW Engineering purchased Synthetic Vision Systems, Inc. VIEW Engineering was an OEM for Mitutoyo in the late 1980s. This relationship was concluded when Mitutoyo licensed VIEW's machine vision technology in 1994. This licensed technology became the foundation for Mitutoyo's video and laser-based CMMs. In 1996, Robotic Vision Systems, Inc. (RVSI) first brought a patent infringement lawsuit against VIEW Engineering related to the coplanarity measurement of packaged semiconductor devices. In 2000, RVSI's patent was finally declared invalid and the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of VIEW Engineering. Even after this ruling, RVSI contemplated continuing its appeals through 2001. Also in 1996, VIEW Engineering was purchased by General Scanning, Inc. (GSI). Quality Vision International, Inc. (QVI) purchased the company from GSI Lumonics (previously GSI) in 2000. In 2005, QVI combined VIEW Engineering with Micro Metric, Inc. of San Jose, California, and in 2008 renamed the new company \\"VIEW Micro-Metrology.\\" In 2009, VIEW's California operations were relocated to QVI's Western Region facility in Tempe, Arizona. VIEW Micro-Metrology continues to be global supplier of high-accuracy video coordinate measuring systems and software, primarily serving micro-electronic, mobile device and data storage manufacturing.

The player takes control of a group of up to four customised characters from three separate character classes‚Äîknight, archer, or wizard‚Äîwho must travel on missions either for their nation or related to the main narrative. The story is advanced by taking part in quests which require the player to travel across the game world on a map with interconnected areas and towns. As players complete more quests, paths to new areas become available to explore. During exploration, the player party is represented as a chess piece on a large board. Each mission has a limited number of moves, with different spaces housing events, items, or battles. Battle sequences take place on convex grid-based fighting area known as the \\"Battle Sphere Reel\\", which the game's camera pans across when party members or enemies take action. Combat uses a turn-based battle system. At the beginning of each turn, the player selects a character's actions; these include standard attacks, special skills, and healing spells or items. Each move or action uses a portion of the party's Action Point (AP) metre, which is replenished by a set amount each turn or when an enemy is defeated. Using particular skills or weapons repeatedly unlocks new skills for a character. By outfitting characters in new weapons, armor, and ornaments, a player may increase a characters statistics which allow them to become stronger, as well as further impact their appearance. Completing battles rewards experience points which raise the party's attributes, and currency used to buy items or equipment in towns and at the group's base. If a unit of the player is killed, it will be removed from the rest of the battle, receiving half the EXP and returning with 1 HP after the battle. If the entire party is defeated, the game ends. Making use of the PlayStation Portable's PlayStation Network online function, players could battle each other in groups representing one of the game's three kingdoms. As each group wins battles against opposing factions, they expand their territory within the online environment, granting them access to rewards and a standing on community-based leaderboards. Winning groups may vote on which territory to attack next, and individual players may opt to have their characters controlled by artificial intelligence rather than themselves manually. The servers were shut down on October 31, 2013. Synopsis Grand Knights History is a set in the fantasy world of Rystia, which is divided into three warring kingdoms: Logres, the Ancient Kingdom, ruled by King Fausel; Union, the Kingdom of Knights, ruled by King Leon; and Avalon, the Kingdom of Magic, ruled by Queen Muse. The player is the head of a newly-formed group of knights, who allies with one of the warring nations. Upon their employment, the mercenaries are assigned a young assistant called Liscia, who aids them on their campaigns for the chosen nation. During their campaigns, the group collect relics known as the Saint's Treasures; cross paths with a witch named Mira; and a band commanded by the Masked Knight, who knows Liscia and attempts to take her into hiding against her will. During one mission to rescue Bishop Noyce of Rystia's Saint's Church, an ancient demon called the King of Chaos begins breaking free of its prison. Noyce, recognising Liscia as Lorendina, last descendant of a mythical hero called the Saint, plans to kill her before she can be used as a sacrifice to empower the King of Chaos. The Masked Knight, named Cerueila, was her assigned protector. The mercenaries defend Liscia from the Church, then from the plans of the Clan of Chaos and their fortune teller ally Stola, who use the search for the Saint's Treasures to weaken seals they were maintaining, and manipulated the Church into destroying the Saint's bloodline. Liscia can embody the Saint and seal the King of Chaos again, but doing so will kill her. The mercenaries, escorting Liscia and the allied Mira, and followed by Cerueila, defeat the Church's forces and demons to reach where the heart of the King of Chaos remains. Cerueila sacrifices herself while protecting Liscia, and to save Liscia the mercenary leader interrupts the ritual. Fulfilling her one vision of a happy future, Stola takes Liscia's place in the ritual. Later Liscia arranges to return to her original place with the mercenaries, and they continue their campaigns against neighbouring nations. Development Production on Grand Knights History began in 2009 and lasted around two years. Following the release by Marvelous Entertainment of Muramasa: The Demon Blade in 2009, producer Yoshifumi Hashimoto contacted Vanillaware about working on a new title together, after hearing Vanillaware's Tomohiko Deguchi wanted to develop for the PSP. The game was Vanillaware's first turn-based RPG, with Deguchi aiming for a war-based RPG that would \\"connect everyone\\". Deguchi, acting as the game's director, created the concept for Grand Knights History from his wish to do something new. This concept allowed him to express his wish to use the PSP's wireless communication functions for something unusual. The game's staff at both Vanillaware and Marvellous were fairly young. The game's art director was Kouichi Maenou, who had worked as character designer for GrimGrimoire. The game was Maenou's first time working as art director. After trial and error, he decided to emulate classic Western fantasy art similar to previous Vanillaware titles, using a style of defined lines and soft colours for characters and backgrounds. He also incorporated blank areas around the edges of displays, as if players were looking at a book illustration. As with other Vanillaware titles, Grand Knights Kingdom made use of 2D graphics, but while this style was preserved it was adapted to turn- based role-playing, departing greatly from the company's previous action-based titles. The character animation used the same techniques as earlier Vanillaware titles. When choosing the PSP for the platform, the team wanted to distinguish the game from other titles on the platform, many of which had multiplayer elements. Hashimoto described the multiplayer elements as a cross between online game structure and email communication. As people could not be online all the time, the team designed a system that would keep player parties synchronised on the server. During production, Hashimoto consulted with Sony about the PSP's online elements, referring to them as \\"understanding\\" of the development process. The music for Grand Knights History was composed by a team from Basiscape, a music company founded by Hitoshi Sakimoto who collaborated with Vanillaware since Odin Sphere. The team consisted of Mitsuhiro Kaneda, Yoshimi Kudo, Noriyuki Kamikura and Masaharu Iwata. When he was given the job of lead composer, the game was described by Kaneda as an odd RPG given to the company to work on. A rock music style was requested for the battle themes, something he was not good at, so the final soundtrack ended up mixing rock and orchestral elements together. A soundtrack album was released in 2011. It was positively received by music critics. Grand Knights History was revealed in late March 2009. At the time of its announcement, the game was 70% complete. It released in Japan on September 1, 2011. It was promoted with a commercial featuring the single \\"Navigation\\", performed by J-pop artist fumika. The game was originally planned for a Western release through Xseed Games (North America) and Rising Star Games (Europe). Due to their work on Dragon's Crown, Vanillaware was unable to dedicate any resources to help Xseed Games with the localization, eventually forcing them to cancel it despite the translation being almost complete. Due to Xseed's decision, Rising Star Games also cancelled the European version. An English fan translation was released in 2014. Deguchi would eventually leave Vanillaware and founded Monochrome Corporation. There he developed Grand Kingdom, which drew inspiration from both Grand Knights History and other Vanillaware titles. Reception During its week of release, Grand Knights History reached the top of gaming charts as recorded by Media Create, with debut sales of over 64,600 units. It sold through over 90% of its stock. By the end of September, it had sold over 110,000 units. In their fiscal year report, Marvelous Entertainment cited Grand Knights History as a factor in strong financial gains during 2011. Grand Knights History received a 36 out of 40 possible score from Japanese Famitsu Weekly magazine based on individual reviews of 10, 9, 9, and 8, earning it the publication's Platinum Award. The magazine praised the title's \\"traditionally- Vanillaware graphics\\" and character animations as well as its online mode, stating that \\"The easy entry into online play is just as great, and raising characters to send to the battlefield is both innovative and very smooth in action. This game gets top marks in fun.\\" It also garnered an 82.5 out of 100 average from Dengeki PlayStation magazine based on four reviews of 90, 80, 80, and 80. In a list of Japanese-exclusive PSP titles, Game Informer noted the general excitement for the game following its announcement.

Background In years previous, when asked about legalizing MMA in Ontario, Premier Dalton McGuinty often dismissed the idea as it was stated \\"not a priority for Ontario families\\".The Canadian Press, \\"Ontario to legalize MMA starting in 2011\\", Sportsnet.ca, Accessed on July 16, 2011 However, due to recent overwhelming success of the UFC shows held in Montreal and British Columbia, Ontario realized the potential MMA has in boosting local economies. At the 2008 MMA event held in Montreal, Ontario residents purchased roughly 42% of the tickets sold.Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services, \\"Ontario Moves to Allow Mixed Martial Arts\\", Accessed on July 16, 2011 Marc Ratner, the Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) Vice- President of Regulatory and Government Affairs commented that MMA is popular in Toronto and on a per-capita bases, it is top of the UFC's market with regards to pay-per-view purchases and viewers. Following the suite of professional boxing and kickboxing, MMA will fall under the Ontario Athletics Control Act and will be regulated by the Ontario Athletic Commissioner. The commissioner's key responsibilities will include: ensuring promoters and competitors are appropriately licensed, ensuring fees are paid and liability insurance is obtained, in charge of choosing officials and medical personnel, ensuring each competitor is in good standing, attending and overseeing weigh- ins, pre-fight activities and each MMA event to ensure they comply with standards and regulations. Section 83 of the Criminal Code and MMA For years, the government of Ontario has been reluctant to allow MMA in Ontario despite it being allowed in six Canadian jurisdictions and 46 American states at the time. McGuinty, when questioned on the matter of bringing MMA to Ontario, often responded that it was not a priority and the issue was not on his agenda. He believes that if he were to knock on 1,000 doors of Ontario Family homes and ask them about their top three concerns, he would be surprised if any would say that we need to start MMA in Ontario.CTV.ca News Staff, \\"Ont. premier ducks under UFC's push to legalize MMA\\", Accessed on July 16, 2011 There was also an issue in the interpretation of section 83 of the Criminal Code, which makes \\"prize fighting\\" illegal. At the time Ontario was considering allowing MMA, this section defined \\"prize fighting\\" as follows: :\\"83(2) In this section, \\"prize fight\\" means an encounter or fight with fists or hands between two persons who have met for that purpose by previous arrangement made by or for them, but a boxing contest between amateur sportsmen, where the contestants wear boxing gloves of not less than one hundred and forty grams each in mass, or any boxing contest held with the permission or under the authority of an athletic board or commission or similar body established by or under the authority of the legislature of a province for the control of sport within the province, shall be deemed not to be a prize fight.\\"Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 83(2); repealed and new definition substituted, SC 2013, c 19, s 1. Ontario Athletics Commissioner, Ken Hayashi, thought MMA was not an exception to this and that it is not considered boxing, although Ontario allows professional kickboxing. He believed that any combat sport, excluding boxing and kickboxing, is illegal in Ontario (and all of Canada). He was unwilling to budge on the matter causing frustration for MMA lobbyists especially since he was considered the person best positioned to start the legalization process.Steve Buffery ,\\"Ontario's Ultimate stalemate\\", Sun Media, Accessed on July 16, 2011 Lobbying for MMA in Ontario The UFC was responsible for the majority of the lobbying efforts for the sanctioning of MMA in Ontario. They were committed in educating provincial government officials on the sport with hopes to move the legalization efforts quicker. They went ahead with opening an official UFC office in Toronto and placing Tom Wright in charge of the efforts. Tom Wright, former Canadian Football League Commissioner and President of Adidas Canada, was hired to head the Toronto office, as the UFC believed he added creditability to the cause. They believe his accomplishments in the sports, business and community sectors, and the fact that he has lived in Toronto most of his life, will help bridge the gaps more easily than an American.James Brydon,\\"The Wright Approach\\", SportsNet.ca, Accessed on August 2, 2011 The UFC also went on to hire Noble Chummar, an attorney with Cassels, Brock and Blackwell, as legal representation for the UFC in Ontario. This lobbyist firm was hired by the UFC to also assist with educating members of the provincial government on the many reasons why the sport should be sanctioned and regulated.Joe Ferraro,\\"Dana White, Lobbyist Firm Hint That Ontario Is Close\\", FAN590 Sports Net Radio, Accessed on August 2, 2011 There was also public support for the legalization of the MMA. A Facebook group was made for people who believe the sport should be legal in Ontario. The group grew to have more than 7000 members.\\"Legalize MMA in Ontario\\", Accessed on August 2, 2011 Legalization of MMA in Ontario In August 2010, the Ontario government announced that they would allow professional MMA events to be held in the province. However, in order to do so the Government would require a system or guidelines to be implemented in order to regulate MMA events. Ontario adopted rules similar to that of the state of New Jersey for the conduct of professional mixed martial arts events. This is the most widely used set of rules regarding MMA, which is also sometimes referred to as the \\"unified rules of MMA\\". All MMA events in Ontario will be sanctioned and regulated by the Ministry of Consumer Services. Ontario Economic Trouble and MMA Another possible motivation for Ontario's decision to legalize professional MMA events was financial and economic gain these events can bring to local economies. The government believed that a large MMA event could bring in about $6 million in revenue for the province. Many credit the fact that Ontario's local economy was struggling the year prior to the decision and that with Ontario having a deficit of around $20 billion at the time. MMA events in Ontario would generate and stimulate Ontario tourism and possibly generate millions in economic activity. Minister of Consumer Services, Sophia Aggelonitis, said, \\"My other goal is to provide an economic boost for communities who want to hold MMA events.\\" The New Democratic Party, despite criticizing the Liberal government for changing their minds on the sport, supported the legalization of MMA because of the opportunity for economic benefits. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has long waited for and petitioned the Ontario government for legalization of the sport. UFC hosted UFC 129 in Toronto and pulled in a record 55, 000 fans and exceeding 11 million in gate revenue, making it the largest and most profitable MMA event in North America. Canadian Medical Association In August 2010, following the sanctioning of MMA in Ontario, Canada's largest doctors association issued a statement asking the government to ban mixed martial arts. About 250 delegates attended the annual Canadian Medical Association meeting that year and voted for the organization to campaign for the ban. Dr. Anne Zoig, the outgoing CMA president, commented that it's the responsibility of the association to promote good health and oppose any activity that would directly lead to maiming and injury to Canadians. They believe that MMA will lead to serious issues including brain damage and that they cannot support this to continue in Canada. They however have no power in what the policy-makers do with this information. Since the release of their opposition, the UFC commented that the safety of the fighters is a high priority and that the league will be just as rigorous as any other professional sports organization when it comes to the health and safety of its athletes. The Ontario government has also commented that they would have welcomed any advice from the CMA.The Canadian Press,\\"DOCTORS GROUP TO SEEK BAN OF MMA PRIZEFIGHTING IN CANADA\\", TSN.ca, Accessed on August 1, 2011 Dr. Shelby Karpman, a doctor who has supervised over 200 martial arts fights, commented that banning this sport would not have been a solution. It is so popular that the possibility of the sport going underground is extremely high. If there was a ban, the fights will continue and will continue without being medically supervised. There would be no medical personnel or paramedics on-sight and the number of sport-related injuries would greatly increase. He believes the opposite and that MMA is a safe sport when supervised. He comments that he had never seen anyone come close to dying in an MMA ring.CTV.ca News Staff,\\"Mixed martial arts ban 'would take sport underground'\\", Accessed on August 1, 2011 Future of MMA in Ontario It appears that MMA events, such as UFC, will continue to grow in Ontario as such a large fan base has formed. It is anticipated that there will be 10 to 15 professional MMA events, including one large event, will be held annually within Ontario. The UFC will be looking to continue to hold shows in Toronto at both the Air Canada Centre and Rogers Centre. As a possibility in the future, UFC will look for opportunities for holding events in other Ontario cities such as Hamilton, Ottawa and Windsor. The economic benefits to communities that host the events could be substantial. There are also MMA organizations that also have plans as a result of Ontario's new regulations. Warrior One (W1), an Ontario-based MMA league, holds about six shows a year in Quebec and other provinces will also be hosting events in Ontario. The W1 wish to host four to five large shows in Toronto, plus a challenger league that would hold matches in every town across the province from Sudbury to Windsor to London to Hamilton. Local athletes would be able to compete, and small towns would be able enjoy the economic benefits. However, W1 has mentioned that they are not competition for the UFC, but in fact the league right below them.ANTONELLA ARTUSO,\\"Mixed martial arts coming to Ontario\\", Toronto Sun, Accessed on July 19, 2011 There are local organizations that are promoting positive awareness of mixed martial arts within Ontario, and generating local interest in the sport.

Written just before Bromfield's return from decades of living and writing in Europe, the novel reflects the agrarian interests that would dominate the author's thinking during the last two decades of his life. David Anderson describes it as Bromfield's best work but one, like many after the author's early successes, too little appreciated. \\"The unfair criticisms of the early 1930s have discouraged later critics from looking at his work clearly and coherently,\\" he argues.Anderson, David D. \\"Louis Bromfield: Overview.\\" Reference Guide to American Literature.

Plot summary The Farm traces several generations of a family‚Äôs life on and around a fine piece of land in the Western Reserve, early nineteenth-century Ohio. From the time of ‚ÄúThe Colonel,‚Äù the patriarch of the MacDougal family, who first claimed the property, to the novel‚Äôs present, the 1930s, and the family's last owner of the property, Johnny, the Colonel's great grandson, Bromfield traces the interactions between the MacDougals, their neighbours, the nearby town, and the land itself. Throughout the novel, Bromfield suggests the corrosive effects of a mercantile and industrial economy upon the Jeffersonian ideal of an agrarian society. Although the novel ends in the family selling off the farm to a developer who then leases it to less-than-caring tenants, its concern for the land continued as Bromfield returned to the United States and made Malabar Farm a model of sustainable agriculture. Cultural signifiance *In 41: A Portrait of My Father, former United States President George W. Bush recounts that his father, former President George H. W.

Hon. Lord Justice Singh, is an English Court of Appeal judge and President of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, formerly a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division, a Queen's Counsel and barrister, formerly a founding member of Matrix Chambers and a legal academic. Early life and education Rabinder Singh was born in 1964 in Delhi to a Sikh family. He grew up in a working-class part of Bristol and attended the private Bristol Grammar School. From an early age Singh had an interest in law and liked the thought of one day becoming an advocate. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he earned a double first in law in 1985. Between 1985 and 1986 Singh spent a year as a Harkness Fellow at the University of California at Berkeley studying for his LL.M. During his time at Berkeley he became interested in constitutional law, particularly misuse of power and how the law holds those in power to account. This interest was partly fuelled by the late Professor Frank Newman at Berkeley, a pioneer in the field of human rights law and by his studies on the United States Constitution at Berkeley. In 1988 he attended the Inns of Court School of Law to undertake his final examinations, and he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in July 1989. Career at the Bar (1989‚Äì2011) 4‚Äì5 Gray's Inn Square Singh undertook pupillage at the barristers' chambers 4‚Äì5 Gray's Inn Square where he became a tenant in 1990.

With the formation of Matrix, none of the five silks signed up to Matrix at the time was estimated to earn much more than ¬£200,000 a year, Singh however was believed to be the biggest earner of them all. One senior clerk said: \\"The problem they will have is that Rabinder Singh is by far their biggest earner. He will be carrying the rent which could cause a lot of internal politics.\\" Singh has since gone on to be named the Barrister of the Year by the Lawyer Magazine.

USPS 499-920 Design and development Kocjan designed the Orlik family of gliders in the late 1930s. The original Orlik had a wingspan. The Orlik 2 had a wingspan and a glide ratio of 26.5:1. The Orlik 3 was proposed as the One-Design type for the 1940 Summer Olympics, but the DFS Olympia Meise was chosen instead. Regardless, the 1940 Olympics were cancelled by the advent of the Second World War. The development of the series was cut short by Kocjan's murder on 13 August 1944 by the Gestapo as part of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The Orlik gliders were built with a wooden structure, the fuselage covered in wood, while the wings and tail were covered with doped aircraft fabric covering. Glidepath control is via an unusual pair of air brakes located on the underside of the wing just aft of the leading edge, extending from the wing root to the gull bend. Operational history One Orlik 2 was exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. After the fair it was purchased by a private buyer and then confiscated by the US government and pressed into military service as a training glider with the designation XTG-7. After the Second World War ended it was sold as surplus and overhauled by Clarence See. It was then purchased by Paul MacCready who flew it in the 1948 and 1949 US Nationals, winning both contests. MacCready also used the aircraft to set a world altitude record of in 1948, flying in the Sierra mountain wave. MacCready later sold the Orlik to George Lambros and it was flown by Lyle Maxey in the 1961 US Nationals. Next it was purchased by Eldon M. Wilson who modified the aircraft with a faired fixed main wheel with a brake and added a free-blown bubble canopy. Wilson then sold it to John Serafin who intended to get his Diamond badge in the aircraft. The aircraft was completely rebuilt and restored by Ray Parker.

Between many of the today unknown geniuses on history, we can not avoid watching Dante, a man who excelled on the fields of physics, electricity and mathematics. Being him one of the first scientist to actually disagree with Albert Einstein's general relativity theory, doing so by publishing a book called \\"La Relatividad General ante la prueba Suprema\\".(Such book could be is found today in the Argentine National Congress Library ). In this book, Dante Tessieri calls himself \\"Galileo\\", using it as an alias, with the course of the book Dante refers to Einstein with apathy as he tends to correct Einstein's relativity theory with valid references.  His Life  As of today, not much of his life is known. He was born between 1850 and 1875 and died between 1920 and 1935, as a young physicist, he was able to make many discoveries which led him to the attempt of proving the general relativity theory wrong. Other than a great scientist and mathematician but he also took his knowledge and expanded it through writing. Not only did he write his book \\"La Relatividad General ante la pruba Suprema\\" -(The General Relativity) but he was also famous at the time because of his articles on magazines such as the \\"Revista de Obras Publicas\\" -(Magazine of Public Inventions). Between his many articles, today we have one that he titled \\"Expresion de la Potencia de un Ventilador\\" in which he tells the reader how to mathematically find the effectiveness of a fan and how much better could it be with an electric motor, now remember this article was written in December 1904. Between other of his many accomplishments, he was also the leader of the entire masonry in Argentina, a group were only the wise and intellectuals are invited to make part of. To be the leader of the masonry in a country is probably the biggest honor to any person since it means that you are between the most intelligent and influential people in the nation.

He was the muse of Ted Shawn, pioneer of modern dance.  Biography  Born in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and reared in Eustis, Florida, Mumaw began his dance training with a local ballet teacher when he was a boy of fifteen. He also took classes with Berte Rita Lipton, who taught him some fundamentals of modern dance, and he began to study ballet in earnest through a mail-order course from the Veronine Vestoff School of the Ballet in New York City.Veronine Vestoff, Veronine Vestoff Acad√©mie de Danse: A Series of Instructions and Lessons for Becoming a Successful Stage Dancer or Teacher, Classical Ballet Specialty (New York, 1926). A home-study course in thirty-six lessons. In 1930, at 18, Mumaw attended a dance program by the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, the company directed by Ted Shawn and his wife, Ruth St. Denis. It altered the course of his life: entranced by the troupe's choreographic eclecticism and theatrical vividness, he resolved to go to New York to study at Denishawn.Jane Sherman and Barton Mumaw, Barton Mumaw, Dancer: From Denishawn to Jacob's Pillow and Beyond (1986; reprint, Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2000), pp. 1‚Äì19. Mumaw's \\"as-told-to\\" autobiography is the basic source for all biographical and professional information given herein. It contains a detailed list of dances performed, 1933‚Äì1981. An adept student with physical attributes well suited to dance, Mumaw progressed quickly under Shawn's tutelage. While serving as Shawn's driver and dresser, he joined the Denishawn company and performed in the company's last performance at the Lewisohn Stadium with the New York Philharmonic on August 26, 1931. After Shawn and St. Denis split, Shawn retired to his farm in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts and began to teach dance as physical education at a nearby college.Christina L. Schlundt, \\"Shawn, Ted,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 5, p. 585. The farm, called Jacob's Pillow after a large boulder in the woods, soon became the home of Shawn's all-male dance troupe, known as Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers, and later home of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, which continues to flourish there today.Kitty Cunningham, \\"Jacob's Pillow,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 3, pp. 571-72. Mumaw joined Shawn's troupe at its inception in 1933 and remained with it until it disbanded in 1940, having toured extensively throughout the United States. The company's athletic style and powerful dances appealed to Depression-era audiences and did much to make dancing seem like a respectable profession for men. Although not billed as such, Mumaw was unquestionably the star dancer of the troupe. In his memoir, Mumaw reveals that he was Shawn's lover for many years (1931‚Äì1948) and records how their involvement affected every aspect of their professional lives.Sherman and Mumaw (2000), pp. 67‚Äì76. Since same-sex couples were not socially acceptable at the time, the two took great pains to conceal the true nature of their relationship so that no one could accuse dance of being morally questionable. In recognition of his importance in Shawn's life and career and in the development of modern dance, Mumaw is memorialized as the figure on the weather vane atop the Ted Shawn Theater at Jacob's Pillow. After Shawn's company folded, Mumaw toured the concert dance circuit as a soloist, performing works choreographed for him by Shawn as well as works of his own making. Following America's entry into World War II, in December 1941, Mumaw joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and, after basic training as a mechanic, had the good fortune to be assigned to Special Services, a unit created to produce shows to entertain the troops. As a kind of show-business soldier, he served in the military until the end of the war in 1945. Upon returning to civilian life, Mumaw revived his theatrical career as a soloist in concerts and pageants staged by former colleagues in the dance world. In 1947, Helen Tamiris invited him to take the dancing role of Wild Horse in the national company of Annie Get Your Gun, starring Mary Martin. It proved to be a popular role that he would repeat in other productions, touring it as far afield as South Africa, where, in Johannesburg, he also danced the featured role of Dream Curley in a 1950 production of Oklahoma!, with choreography by Agnes de Mille. Returning to New York, he found work on Broadway in the dancing ensemble of Out of This World (1950‚Äì1951), staged by de Mille and choreographed by Hanya Holm. This was followed by The Golden Apple (1954) and My Fair Lady (1956‚Äì1962), both choreographed by Holm, and Lady in the Dark (1963), a college production in Eugene, Oregon. In later life, Mumaw focused on preserving the history and dances of Ted Shawn.Barton Mumaw and Jane Sherman, \\"Ted Shawn: Teacher and Choreographer.\\" Dance Chronicle 4.2 (1980), 91-112. He staged Shawn's choreography at workshops throughout the country, notably setting Kinetic Molpai for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1972, and he supervised revivals of numerous Shawn works at Jacob's Pillow. He can be seen teaching Pierrot in the Dead City (1935) and reminiscing about his years at the Pillow in The Men Who Danced: The Story of Ted Shawn's Men Dancers and the Birth of Jacob's Pillow, 1933-1940, a 1989 documentary film directed by Ron Honsa.This film, which includes historic footage of the company, is commercially available on DVD, issued by Emerging Entertainment. Throughout his life, Mumaw remained fondly attached to the state of Florida, where he had grown up and to which he periodically returned to visit his family. In 1953 he staged Florida Aflame, a historical pageant about the Seminole Indian wars, in Lake Wales, and in 1977 he staged Royal Hunt of the Sun, a pageant celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of a college in St. Petersburg. In both productions he appeared as a solo dancer. He spent his last years at his home in Clearwater, where he died in 2001 at 88.Jack Anderson, \\"Barton Mumaw, 88, Dancer; Member of Ted Shawn Troupe,\\" New York Times (21 June 2001).

Resolution Observations The Security Council reiterated its decision not to renew timber sanctions in Resolution 1521 (2003), and urged the country to implement the forestry reform law. It welcomed the Liberian government's co-operation with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. There was a need for Liberian security forces to assume greater responsibility for national security. Council members determined that there was little progress in meeting the demands of resolutions 1521 and 1532 (2004). The situation in Liberia continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the arms embargo and travel restrictions for a period of twelve months, and restrictions on the sale of diamonds and timber for a period of six months. The measures would be reviewed at the request of the Liberian government. The government was encouraged to take up the offer of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) of joint forestry patrols. An expert panel appointed in Resolution 1689 (2006) overseeing the implementation of sanctions against the country had its mandate extended until June 20, 2007. It was required to report back to the Council by June 6, 2007. All states were required to co-operate with the panel. Meanwhile, the Kimberley Process was instructed to assess progress made by Liberia with respect to joining the Scheme.

He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on 19 July 2011, for concealing the transfer of USD 3.5 million from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to fund his lobbying efforts and influence the US government on the Kashmir conflict, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. His arrest came at a time when relations between Pakistan and the United States were strained in the aftermath of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, and while US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was on a visit to India. On 7 December 2011, Fai pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion (both charges); in March 2012, Fai was sentenced to two years' imprisonment by a US court for \\"conspiracy to defraud the US\\" by concealing transfer of funding from Pakistan's ISI for his illegal lobbying efforts on Kashmir. Early life Fai was born in the Wadwan village of Badgam district in Jammu and Kashmir, India. He graduated from Srinagar's Sri Pratap College, then completed an MA from Aligarh Muslim University before studying on a scholarship in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He moved to the U.S. in 1977 and became a US citizen in 1990. He was a member of Jamaat-e-Islami during his college days. During childhood he was friends with Muhammad Yusuf Shah, who grew up to be a Hizbul Mujahideen leader. Fraudulent Academic Credentials For decades, Fai has claimed, as he continues to, to have earned a PhD from Temple University in Philadelphia and constantly referred to himself as \\"Dr. Fai\\", as was echoed in the Pakistani media. After moving to the United States in 1977 he began a course in mass communications at Temple University on 'Television in Saudi Arabia'. He completed less than half the PhD requirements and did not receive a degree, yet constantly referred to himself as \\"Dr. Fai\\" in official correspondence with the FBI and other law enforcement bodies. As of 2019, he continues to use his false \\"Phd\\" credential in his public engagements, and press outlets.https://dailytimes.com.pk/390920/no-alternative-to-self- determination-in-kashmir-dispute/https://www.dnaindia.com/india/photo-gallery- imran-meets-ghulam-nabi-fai-in-new-york-isi-mole-and-convicted-felon-who-was- caught-by-fbi-in-2011-2791906 Kashmiri American Council Fai was the executive director of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC), an ISI module based in Washington, D.C., for the cause of \\"propagating the cause of the right of self-determination of the people of the State of Jammu & Kashmir\\". The KAC was formed by some members of the Kashmiri diaspora,[2] in Washington, D.C. According to the FBI, the Kashmiri American Council - a nonprofit organization - would arrange seminars, conferences and lectures on Kashmir.[4] Officially the KAC denied getting any foreign grants.[5] KAC is best known for annually holding a so-called \\"Kashmir Peace Conference\\" in Washington, D.C. which was presented as \\"an independent forum for Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri voices\\". However, the U.S. Justice Department proved in court that the Pakistan Army, specifically the I.S.I., approved the list of speakers and gave Fai talking points to \\"highlight the Kashmir cause\\". Political access Before his arrest in July 2011 and subsequent electronically monitored house arrest in Virginia, USA, he was a regular visitor to Pakistan and met regularly and openly with the highest levels of the political, bureaucratic and military establishment, including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In the US, Fai's access extended to various mid-level officials in the State Department, as well as a variety of backbenchers including non-ranking Congressmen and a handful of Senators. Typically, his access was limited to those Congressmen to whose election funds the Kashmir American Council (see above) had donated monies, including Joe Pitts (R-Pennsylvania) and Dan Burton (R-Indiana). Fai has never had a meeting with any Secretary of State or with a serving US Ambassador or equivalent rank of official. Since forfeiting his Indian citizenship by taking US citizenship in 1990, he has been denied visas to visit India on account of his now-publicly-reported ties to the Pakistani Military, in particular the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). He has never had a meeting in any third country with any Indian elected official or any senior diplomat. Arrest Fai was charged along with a Pakistani American associate named Zaheer Ahmad for obtaining illegal funding from Pakistan for the KAC. Fai was arrested at his home in Fairfax, Virginia. According to Neil MacBride, the United States Attorney at United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia \\"Mr. Fai is accused of a decades-long scheme with one purpose ‚Äì to hide Pakistan's involvement behind his efforts to influence the U.S. government's position on Kashmir, his handlers in Pakistan allegedly funneled millions through the Kashmir Center to contribute to U.S. elected officials, fund high-profile conferences, and pay for other efforts that promoted the Kashmiri cause in favor of Pakistan to decision makers in Washington.\\" According to prosecutors he was directed by ISI and was in touch with them at least 4000 times in the preceding 3 years. The prosecutors also alleged that Kashmiri American Council was run by elements of Pakistani government including ISI and had Fai had received at least $4 million from the Government of Pakistan. If convicted Fai faces up to 5 years in prison. Zaheer Ahmad was not arrested and was thought to be living in Pakistan. On 8 October 2011, it was reported that Ahmad had died in Islamabad at the age of 63 due to a brain haemorrhage. Bail At his initial court appearance, the prosecution claimed that, after his arrest, Fai had admitted to receiving money from ISI but said that he maintained an independent viewpoint on issues pertaining to Kashmir. FBI agent Sarah Linden stated that previously Fai had denied knowing anyone from ISI. Fai himself said nothing at the trial. He was granted bail and placed under house arrest. His and his wife's passports were confiscated, and Fai was forbidden from making any contact with any foreign government or witness. Guilty plea On 7 December 2011, Fai pleaded guilty in the court of conspiracy and tax evasion. As part of his guilty plea, Fai signed an 81-paragraph \\"Statement of Fact\\" cataloguing his crimes, with specific details as to the instructions and payments he received from his ISI handlers. Court documents revealed his primary ISI handlers to have been Javeed Aziz Khan (alias \\"Brigadier Abdullah ('Khan')\\"; Major-General Mumtaz Ahmad Bajwa, who later became head of the ISI's Security Directorate that oversees Kashmiri militant groups, Lieutenant-Colonel Touqeer Mehmood Butt, and Sohail Mahmood (alias \\"Mir\\"). An attorney submitted in a foot-note to a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, that Fai misled people about possessing a doctorate degree. In March 2012 Fai was sentenced to two years in prison.Matthew Barakat, Kashmir activist sentenced to 2 years in Va., Associated Press, 30 March 2012. Sentence reduction and release On 15 November 2013, the Assistant US Attorney who had prosecuted Fai asked the court to reduce Fai's sentence to 16 months time served. The motion was granted by the original sentencing judge on 22 November 2013, and Fai was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.Aziz Haniffa, US court releases Kashmiri separatist Ghulam Nabi Fai, Rediff News, 26 December 2013. Reactions The Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. issued a statement after the arrest claiming that \\"it had no knowledge\\" of Fai's alleged ties with the Pakistani establishment, though he was a regular visitor to the Embassy. However an unnamed Pakistani official told The Independent that Fai was getting funding from ISI as he was unable to raise money from the Pakistani American community. The Pakistani government lodged its concern over the arrest and accused the US of embarking on a \\"slander campaign\\" against Pakistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan released a statement lauding the \\"contributions made by the Kashmiri American Council and Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai for the cause of Jammu and Kashmir.\\" It further commented that \\"upholding fundamental rights of Kashmiris is the fundamental responsibility of the international community and all conscientious people who value human rights and values\\" and added that \\"campaigns to defame the just cause of the Kashmiri people will not affect its legitimacy.\\" A statement released by the Home ministry of India said \\"The arrest of Ghulam Nabi Fai was long overdue. We had (a) fair degree of suspicion that the money which he received was given by the agencies in Pakistan.\\" Fai donated money to Congressman Joseph R. Pitts over the years. After finding out about Fai's arrest, Pitts donated the same amount to charity. Pitts denied knowing Fai had external financings. In a letter published in Intelligencer Journal Pitt wrote \\"Clearly, much more was going on. Dr. Fai will get his day in court. Before long, we will learn exactly what he was doing behind the scenes. Whatever the ISI hoped to accomplish, it didn't work.\\" U.S representative from Indiana Dan Burton, who frequently supports Pakistan's position on Kashmir, was a major recipient of contributions from Fai. Expressing shock at his arrest, Burton admitted to having known Fai for more than 20 years and stated \\"in that time I had no inkling of his involvement with any foreign intelligence operation and had presumed our correspondence was legitimate\\". He said that funds he received from Fai would be donated to the Boy Scouts of America. Fai's arrest was condemned by separatist Kashmiri leaders including Syed Ali Shah Geelani. His arrest was welcomed by the Kashmiri Pandit community. According to Lalit Koul, the President of the Indo-American Kashmir Forum, \\"It was always clear that this (Fai's) group was following the official Pakistani version of the Kashmir story. In all instances, the truth was obfuscated by misinformation provided by our opponents masquerading as Kashmiri freedom fighters.\\" Post release After being released, as of March 2020, the Sunday Guardian reported that Fai has appeared on media channels across US to highlight \\"Indian atrocities in Kashmir and against Muslims\\", authored articles, collaborated with Indian influencers, and resumed his interactions with members of the US Senate.

They are analogous to (but not at all equivalent to) the Bloch equations which describe the motion of the nuclear magnetic moment in an electromagnetic field. The equations can be derived either semiclassically or with the field fully quantized when certain approximations are made. Semi-classical formulation The derivation of the semi-classical optical Bloch equations is nearly identical to solving the two- state quantum system (see the discussion there). However, usually one casts these equations into a density matrix form. The system we are dealing with can be described by the wave function: : \\\\psi = c_g\\\\psi_g + c_e\\\\psi_e : \\\\left|c_g\\\\right|^2 + \\\\left|c_e\\\\right|^2 = 1 The density matrix is : \\\\rho = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\rho_{ee} & \\\\rho_{eg} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho_{ge} & \\\\rho_{gg}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}c_e c_{e}^* & c_e c_{g}^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_g c_{e}^* & c_g c_{g}^* \\\\end{bmatrix} (other conventions are possible; this follows the derivation in Metcalf (1999)).Metcalf, Harold.

Derivation from cavity quantum electrodynamics Beginning with the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings Hamiltonian under coherent drive :H=\\\\omega_c a^\\\\dagger a + \\\\omega_a \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger\\\\sigma+ig(a^\\\\dagger\\\\sigma-a\\\\sigma^\\\\dagger)+iJ(a^\\\\dagger e^{-i\\\\omega_l t}-a e^{i\\\\omega_l t}) where a is the lowering operator for the cavity field, and \\\\sigma=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\sigma_x - i\\\\sigma_y\\\\right) is the atomic lowering operator written as a combination of Pauli matrices. The time dependence can be removed by transforming the wavefunction according to |\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{e}^{-i\\\\omega_l t\\\\left(a^\\\\dagger a + \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger\\\\sigma\\\\right)}|\\\\psi\\\\rangle, leading to a transformed Hamiltonian :H=\\\\Delta_c a^\\\\dagger a + \\\\Delta_a \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger\\\\sigma+ig(a^\\\\dagger\\\\sigma-a\\\\sigma^\\\\dagger)+iJ( a^\\\\dagger-a) where \\\\Delta_i = \\\\omega_i - \\\\omega_l . As it stands now, the Hamiltonian has four terms. The first two are the self energy of the atom (or other two level system) and field. The third term is an energy conserving interaction term allowing the cavity and atom to exchange population and coherence. These three terms alone give rise to the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of dressed states, and the associated anharmonicity in the energy spectrum. The last term models coupling between the cavity mode and a classical field, i.e. a laser. The drive strength J is given in terms of the power transmitted through the empty two- sided cavity as J=\\\\sqrt{2P(\\\\Delta_c^2 + \\\\kappa^2)/(\\\\omega_c \\\\kappa)} , where 2\\\\kappa is the cavity linewidth. This brings to light a crucial point concerning the role of dissipation in the operation of a laser or other CQED device; dissipation is the means by which the system (coupled atom/cavity) interacts with its environment. To this end, dissipation is included by framing the problem in terms of the master equation, where the last two terms are in the Lindblad form :\\\\dot{\\\\rho}=-i[H,\\\\rho] + 2\\\\kappa\\\\left(a\\\\rho a^\\\\dagger -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(a^\\\\dagger a \\\\rho + \\\\rho a^\\\\dagger a\\\\right)\\\\right) + 2\\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\sigma\\\\rho \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\sigma^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma\\\\rho + \\\\rho \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma\\\\right)\\\\right) The equations of motion for the expectation values of the operators can be derived from the master equation by the formulas \\\\langle O \\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(O\\\\rho\\\\right) and \\\\langle\\\\dot{O}\\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left(O\\\\dot{\\\\rho}\\\\right) . The equations of motion for \\\\langle a\\\\rangle , \\\\langle\\\\sigma\\\\rangle , and \\\\langle\\\\sigma_z\\\\rangle , the cavity field, atomic coherence, and atomic inversion respectively, are :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle a \\\\rangle = i\\\\left(-\\\\Delta_c \\\\langle a \\\\rangle - ig\\\\langle \\\\sigma\\\\rangle - iJ\\\\right) -\\\\kappa \\\\langle a \\\\rangle :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle \\\\sigma \\\\rangle = i\\\\left(-\\\\Delta_a \\\\langle \\\\sigma \\\\rangle - ig\\\\langle a \\\\sigma_z \\\\rangle\\\\right) -\\\\gamma \\\\langle \\\\sigma \\\\rangle :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle \\\\sigma_z \\\\rangle = -2g\\\\left(\\\\langle a^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma \\\\rangle+\\\\langle a \\\\sigma^\\\\dagger \\\\rangle\\\\right) -2\\\\gamma \\\\langle \\\\sigma_z\\\\rangle-2\\\\gamma At this point, we have produced three of an infinite ladder of coupled equations. As can be seen from the third equation, higher order correlations are necessary. The differential equation for the time evolution of \\\\langle a^\\\\dagger \\\\sigma \\\\rangle will contain expectation values of higher order products of operators, thus leading to an infinite set of coupled equations. We heuristically make the approximation that the expectation value of a product of operators is equal to the product of expectation values of the individual operators. This is akin to assuming that the operators are uncorrelated, and is a good approximation in the classical limit. It turns out that the resulting equations give the correct qualitative behavior even in the single excitation regime. Additionally, to simplify the equations we make the following replacements :\\\\langle a \\\\rangle = (\\\\gamma/\\\\sqrt{2} g)x :\\\\langle \\\\sigma \\\\rangle = -p/\\\\sqrt{2} :\\\\langle \\\\sigma_z\\\\rangle = -D :\\\\Theta = \\\\Delta_c/\\\\kappa : C = g^2/2\\\\kappa\\\\gamma : y = \\\\sqrt{2} g J/\\\\kappa\\\\gamma : \\\\Delta=\\\\Delta_a/\\\\gamma And the Maxwell‚ÄìBloch equations can be written in their final form :\\\\dot{x}=\\\\kappa\\\\left(-2Cp+y-(i\\\\Theta+1)x\\\\right) :\\\\dot{p} = \\\\gamma\\\\left( -(1+i\\\\Delta)p + xD\\\\right) :\\\\dot{D}=\\\\gamma\\\\left(2(1-D)-(x^*p+xp^*)\\\\right) Application: Atom-Laser Interaction Within the dipole approximation and rotating-wave approximation, the dynamics of the atomic density matrix, when interacting with laser field, is described by optical Bloch equation, whose effect can be divided into two parts: Optical Dipole Force, and Scattering Force.

A native of Fort Clark, Texas, he was the first United States Ambassador to Iran, serving that post from 1944 to 1945. Earlier he was United States Ambassador to Iceland from 1942. Morris served many other diplomatic posts including American Consul General in Jerusalem in 1936, American Consul General in Vienna from 1938 to 1940 after the German annexation of Austria and the American charg√© d'affaires in Germany during the outbreak of official American involvement in World War II. His mother was Susan Frances (n√©e Reece) Morris and his father was Louis Thompson Morris, a colonel in the United States Army. During his post in Vienna, Morris is credited by the Jewish-Austrian author Felix Salten for ensuring his and his family's protection from persecution by Nazi authorities. Salten and his wife Ottilie Metzl were able to emigrate to Switzerland due to their daughter Anna- Katharina having married a Swiss man. Service in Germany during World War II Morris became the American Charg√© d'affaires in Germany in October 1940. Prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States was officially neutral and retained a diplomatic corps in Berlin. This included diplomat George Kennan. Morris, serving as Charg√© d'Affaires, was the highest ranking American diplomat in Germany at the time (the last United States Ambassador, Hugh R. Wilson, was recalled in 1938 in protest of Kristallnacht). On December 11, after the Pearl Harbor attack, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop summoned Morris to his office and read to Morris Germany's formal declaration of war and addressed him by accusing the United States of violations of neutrality and other acts of war. Upon handing Morris the declaration, Ribbentrop said, \\"Your President has wanted this war, now he has it.\\" Official diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany thus ended. On December 14, most of the American diplomatic corps still in Germany, including Morris, Kennan and Associated Press journalist Louis P. Lochner were detained by German authorities and held at a former resort near Bad Nauheim. In February 1942, through Swiss diplomats, Morris reported conditions of the detainment to his superiors in Washington. While there was relative freedom of movement around the resort grounds, he wrote of food shortages and weight-loss amongst the group. In May, Morris and the other Americans were transferred to Lisbon, Portugal where they departed for New York aboard the SS Drottningholm and exchanged for German prisoners being held in the United States. He died on July 2, 1950, at the age of 64, in Washington, D.C. References External links *U. S.

Influenced by electrotherapy and escharotics ‚Äî the medical application of caustic substances ‚Äî doctors began using radiation to treat growths and lesions produced by diseases such as lupus, basal cell carcinoma, and epithelioma. Radiation was generally believed to have bactericidal properties, so when radium was discovered, in addition to treatments similar to those used with x-rays, it was also used as an additive to medical treatments for diseases such as tuberculosis where there were resistant bacilli. Additionally, because radiation was found to exist in hot spring waters which were reputed for their curative powers, it was marketed as a wonder cure for all sorts of ailments in patent medicine and quack cures. It was believed by medical science that small doses of radiation would cause no harm and the harmful effects of large doses were temporary. The widespread use of radium in medicine ended when it was discovered that physical tolerance was lower than expected and exposure caused long term cell damage that could appear in carcinoma up to 40 years after treatment. The use of radiation continues today as a treatment for cancer in radiation therapy. Early development of radiotherapy (1895‚Äì1905) The imaging properties of x-rays were discovered, their practical uses for research and diagnostics were immediately apparent, and soon their use spread in the medical field. X-rays were used to diagnose bone fractures, heart disease, and phthisis. Inventive procedures for different diagnostic purposes were created, such as filling digestive cavities with bismuth, which allowed them to be seen through tissue and bone. Discovery of the therapeutic potential of radiation During early practical work and scientific investigation, experimenters noticed that prolonged exposure to x-rays created inflammation and, more rarely, tissue damage on the skin. The biological effect attracted the interest of L√©opold Freund and Eduard Schiff, who, only a month or two after R√∂ntgen's announcement, suggested they be used in the treatment of disease. At approximately the same time, Emil Grubbe, of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896, began experimenting in Chicago with medical uses of x-rays. Escharotics by this time had already been used to treat skin malignancies through caustic burns, and electrotherapy had also been experimented with, in the aim to stimulate the skin tissue. The first attempted x-ray treatment was by Victor Despeignes, a French physician who used them on a patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment was followed by a diminution of pain and reduction in the size of the tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments. Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a naevus in order to induce epilation and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of lupus vulgaris. A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies. Thereafter they did a successful treatment of lupus erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly- patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects. Within a few months, scientific journals were swamped with accounts of the successful treatment of different types of skin tissue malignancies with x-rays. In Sweden, Thor Stenbeck published results of the first successful treatments of rodent ulcer and epithelioma in 1899, later that year confirmed by Tage Sj√∂gren. Soon afterwards, their findings were confirmed by a number of other physicians. The nature of the active agent in therapeutic treatment was still unknown, and subject to wide dispute. Freund and Schiff believed it to because of electrical discharge, Nikola Tesla argued they were because of the ozone generated by the x-rays, while others argued that it was the x-rays themselves. Tesla's position was soon refuted, and only the other two theories remained. In 1900, Robert Kienb√∂ck produced a study based on a series of experiments that demonstrated that it was the x-rays themselves. Studies published in 1899 and 1900 suggested that the rays varied in penetration according to the degree of vacuum in the tube. Niels Finsen and phototherapy The Finsen hospital lamp, 1900. The projecting tubes can be adjusted so as to permit the focusing of the light, which is directed through a hollow lens that's kept pressed down upon the part under treatment. The nurses and patients are wearing dark glasses to protect the eyes from the light. Niels Finsen, a Faroese-Danish physician, had by that time already pursued interest in the biological effects of light. He published a paper, Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden (\\"On the effects of light on the skin\\") in 1893. Inspired by the discovery that x-rays could have therapeutic effects, he extended his research to examine directed light rays. In 1896, he published a paper on his findings, Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler (\\"The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine\\"). Finsen discovered that lupus was amenable to treatment by ultraviolet rays when separated out by a system of quartz crystals, and thereafter created a lamp to sift out the rays. The so-called Finsen lamp became widely used in for phototherapy, and derivatives of it became used when experimenting with other types of radiotherapy. Modifications were made to Finsen's original design, and it found its most common forms in the Finsen-Reyn lamp and Finsen-Lomholt lamp . By 1905, it was estimated that fully 50 percent of the cases of lupus were successfully healed by Finsen's methods. Finsen was soon awarded a Nobel prize for his research. R√∂ntgenotherapy X-ray apparatus used for treatment of epithelioma of the face, 1915. The tube is in a localizing shield, and a perforated sheet of metal is securely fashioned to the surface by adhesive plaster. From initial therapeutic experiments, a new field of x-ray therapy was born, referred to as r√∂ntgenotherapy after Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, the discoverer of x-rays. It was still unclear how the x-rays acted on the skin; however, it was generally agreed upon that the area affected was killed and either discharged or absorbed. By 1900, there were four well established classes of problems that were treated by x-ray, based on a set of five classes initially outlined by Freund: 1. in hypertrichosis, for the removal of unwanted hair; 2. in the treatment of disease of hair and hair follicles in which it was necessary to remove hair; 3. in the treatment of inflammatory affections on the skin like eczema and acne; 4. and in the treatment of malignant affections on the skin in cases like lupus and epithelioma. Additionally, x-rays were successfully applied to other appearances of carcinoma, trials were done in treating leukemia, and because of the supposed bactericidal properties, there were suggestions it could be used in diseases such as tuberculosis. Experiments were also done using x-rays to treat epilepsy, which had previously also experimentally been treated with electrical currents. Further development and the use of radium (1905‚Äì1915) Because of the excitement over the new treatment, literature about the therapeutic effects of x-rays often exaggerated the propensity to cure different diseases. Reports of the fact that in some cases treatment worsened some of the patients' conditions were ignored in favor of hopeful optimism. Henry G. Piffard referred to these practitioners as \\"radiomaniacs\\" and \\"radiografters\\". It was found that x-rays were only capable of producing a cure in certain cases of the basal cell type of epithelioma and exceedingly unreliable in malignant cancer, not making it a suitable replacement for surgery. In many cases of treatment, the cancer recurred after a period of time. X-ray experiments in pulmonary tuberculosis proved useless. Aside from the medical profession losing faith in the ability of x-ray therapy, the public increasingly viewed it as a dangerous type of treatment. This resulted in a period of pessimism about the use of x-rays, which lasted from about 1905 to 1910 or 1912. Radium therapy  Small tubes containing radium salts are strapped to a woman's face to treat what was either lupus or rodent ulcer, 1905. Soon after the discovery of radium in 1898 by Pierre and Marie Curie, there was speculation in whether the radiation could be used for therapy in the same way as that from x-rays. The physiological effect of radium was first observed in 1900 by Otto Walkhoff, and later confirmed by what famously known as the \\"Becquerel burn\\". In 1901, Henri Becquerel had placed a tube of radium in a waistcoat pocket where it had remained for several hours; a week or two after which there was severe inflammation of his skin underneath where the radium had been kept. Ernest Besnier, a dermatologist, examined the skin and expressed the opinion that it was due to the radium, leading to experiments by Curie which confirmed it. Besnier suggested the use of radium for therapy along the same purposes as x-rays and ultraviolet rays. Becquerel for this purpose loaned some radium to Henri-Alexandre Danlos of the h√¥pital St. Louis in Paris in 1901. Danlos successfully treated a few cases of lupus with an admixture of radium and barium chloride. Further trials of radium therapy began, though at a much slower pace than did those using x-rays because radium was expensive and difficult to obtain. Methods of application Glass applicators for radium emanation, 1918. Illustration showing a tube for applying radium salts, 1918. Radium was soon seen as a way to treat disorders that were not affected enough by x-ray treatment because it could be applied in a multitude of ways in which x-rays could not. Different methods of applying radium had been tested, which fell into two categories: the use of radium emanation (now referred to as radon), and the use of radium salts. One method using emanation was through inhalation, where it was mixed with air. Radium inhalation had been most studied in Germany, where regular inhalation institutes were established, and the goal was to target the lungs. That was done either to treat lung diseases, like tuberculosis, or to be absorbed through the surface of the lung to the blood, where it could circulate through the body. It was claimed that the beneficial effects produced by radium water baths were the result of inhalation of the vapors. Another method of treatment was to condense the emanation at liquid air temperature on substances such as vasoline, glycerine, and lanoline, to apply externally to the part affected; or on quinine, bismuth, subnitrate, and arsenic, to be consumed or applied internally. Radium emanation was also passed into glass or metal tubes or flat glass-tight applicators and applied in the same way as radium tubes. In other cases was also deposited on metal points or flat surfaces of metal using electrical devices, which had the same level of radioactivity as the parent radium, but lasted a shorter duration. One way of treatment was to then drive the deposits of radioactive material into tissue using galvanic current. It was also a method of applying radium emanation to a specially designed applicator constructed to suit the needs of the patient, who could later take it home. Dilute solutions of radium salts were also made, meant to be used internally. Patients would be prescribed regular dosages. More rarely, the salts were also suspended in liquids to be injected in subcutaneous treatments, which could be applied locally to affected tissues. That was considered the most expensive method, because the radium used was irreparably lost. As with radium emanation, solutions of free radium salts were also placed in tubes; in this case, the tubes were made from platinum. In metal tubes, the radium could be employed in a number of ways: externally; to the interior of the body in places like the mouth, nose, esophagus, rectum and vagina; and into the substance of a tumor through incisions. Radium baths In 1903, the discoverer of the electron, J. J. Thomson, wrote a letter to the journal Nature in which he detailed his discovery of the presence of radioactivity in well water. Soon after, others found that the waters in many of the world's most famous health springs were also radioactive. This radioactivity is due to the presence of radium emanation produced by the radium that is present in the ground through which the waters flow. In 1904, Nature published a study on the natural radioactivity of different mineral waters. Inspired by this, using preparations of radium salts in bath water was suggested as a way for patients to be treated at home, as the radio-activity in the bathwater was permanent. Radium baths became used experimentally to treat arthritis, gout, and neuralgias. R√∂ntgenotherapy vs. radium therapy X-ray treatment of tuberculosis in 1910 X-rays and radium were noted by physicians to have different advantages in different cases. The most marked effects produced with radium therapy were with lupus, ulcerous growths, and keloid, particularly because they could be applied more specifically to tissues than with x-rays. Radium was generally to be preferred when a localized reaction was desired, while for x-rays when a large area needed to be treated. Radium was also believed to be bactericidal, while x-rays were not. Because they could not be applied locally, x-rays were also found to have worse cosmetic effects than radium when treating malignancies. In certain cases, a combination of x-ray and radium therapy was suggested. In many skin diseases, the ulcers would be treated with radium and the surrounding areas with x-rays so it would positively affect the lymphatic systems. Tuberculosis and iodo-radium therapy After using radium in the surgical treatment of tuberculosis, researchers including B√©la Augustin and A. de Szendeffy soon developed a treatment using radioactive metholated iodine, which was patented under the name dioradin (formed from \\"iodine and radium\\") in 1911. Application of this treatment was referred to as iodo-radium therapy, and involved injecting dioradin intramuscularly. It seemed promising to the developers, because in several cases, fever and hemoptysis had disappeared. Inhalation of iodine alone had been an experimental treatment for tuberculosis in France between 1830 and 1870. Commercialization, quackery, and the end of an era (1915‚Äì1935) Advertisement for a scientifically developed radiation emanation activator. This particular device is suggested for use by Augustus Call√© in a textbook on post-graduate medicine. Widespread commercial exploitation of radium only began in 1913, by which time more efficient methods of extracting radium from pitchblende had been discovered and the mining of radium had taken off. Commercial products The Revigator \\"radioactive water crock\\" (1930s) \\"Tho-radia\\" powder, based on radium and thorium, according to the formula of Dr Alfred Curie The radium commonly used in bath salts, waters, and muds was in low-grade preparations, due to the expense, and their usefulness in curative solutions was questioned, since it had been agreed upon by physicians that radium could only be used successfully in high doses. It was believed that even radiation emanation at higher doses than were useful would cause no harm, because the radioactive deposits were found to have been absorbed and released in urine and waste within a period of three hours. Radiation emanation activators Radium emanation activators, apparatuses that would apply radium emanation to water, started being produced and marketed. Scientifically constructed emanators were sold to hospitals, universities, and independent researchers. Certain companies advertised that they would only give them out to others on a medical prescription and would guarantee the strength of radium in each dose. Many products which imitated emanation activators were more broadly marketed to the public. One such product was the Revigator, a \\"radioactive water crock.\\" A dispensing jar made of radium-containing ore, the idea was that radon produced by the ore would dissolve in the water overnight. It was advertised: \\"Fill jar every night. Drink freely . . . when thirsty and upon arising and retiring, average six or more glasses daily.\\" The American Medical Association (AMA) was concerned that the public was being fleeced by charlatans. In response, the AMA established guidelines (in effect from 1916 to 1929) that emanators seeking AMA approval had to generate more than 2 ŒºCi (74 kBq) of radon per liter of water in a 24-hour period. Most devices on the market, including the Revigator did not meet that standard. Patent medicines Many other quack cures and patent medicines were sold on the market. Radithor, a solution of radium salts, was claimed by its developer William J. A. Bailey to have curative properties. Many brands of toothpaste were laced with radium that was claimed to make teeth shine whiter, such as Doramad Radioactive Toothpaste. Ostensibly, this would be because the radium would kill the bacteria in a person's mouth. One item, called \\"Degnen's Radio-Active Eye Applicator\\" manufactured by the Radium Appliance Company of Los Angeles, California, was sold as a treatment for myopia, hypermetropia, and presbyopia. Face creams and powders were sold, with names like 'Revigorette' and 'Tho-radia'. It was also sold as a supplement to smoking cigarettes. Companies also marked radioactive pads and compresses for the treatment of illnesses. Joachimsthal radium spa hotel In light of the supposed curative properties of radioactivity, a spa was opened up in Joachimsthal, the place at which Madame Curie gathered some of her original samples of radium from spring waters. Radon inhalation rooms were set up, where air tubes carried the gas up from a processing tank in the basement; the visitor would then use it through an inhalation apparatus. Baths were set up which were also irradiated, and irradiated air was also filtered through a trumpet-like pipe for inhalation. Public health concerns Concerns about radium were brought up before the United States Senate by California Senator John D. Works as early as 1915. In a floor speech he quoted letters from doctors asking about the efficacy of the products that were marketed. He stressed that radiation had the effect of making many cancers worse, many doctors thought the belief that radium could be used to cure cancers at that stage of the development of therapy was a \\"delusion\\" ‚Äî one doctor quoted cited a failure-to-success rate of 100 to 1 ‚Äî and the effects of radium water were undemonstrated. Around the start of the 1920s, new public health concerns were sparked by the deaths of factory workers at a radioluminescent watch factory. In 1932, a well-known industrialist, Eben Byers died of radiation poisoning from the use of Radithor, a radium water guaranteed by the manufacturer to contain 2 ŒºCi of radium. Cases sprung up of the development of carcinoma in patients who had used conventional radium therapy up to 40 years after the original treatments. Robley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At MIT he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the National Bureau of Standards to establish the tolerance level for radium of 0.1 ŒºCi (3.7 kBq). Coutard method At the International Congress of Oncology in Paris in 1922, Henri Coutard, a French radiologist working with the Institut Curie, presented evidence that laryngeal cancer could be treated without disastrous side-effects. Coutard was inspired by the observations of Claudius Regaud, who found that a single dose of x-rays sufficient enough to produce severe skin damage and tissue destruction in a rabbit, if administered in fractions, over a course of days, would sterilize the rabbit but have no effect on subcutaneous tissues. By 1934, Coutard had developed a protracted, fractionated process that remains the basis for current radiation therapy. Coutard's dosage and fractionation were designed to create a severe but recoverable acute mucosal reaction. Unlike previous physicians, who believed that cancerous cells were more affected by radiation, he assumed that the population of cancerous cells had the same sensitivity for regeneration as normal cells. Coutard reported a 23% cure rate in the treatment of head and neck cancer. In 1935, hospitals everywhere began following his treatment plan. Radiation therapy today (1935‚Äî) Treatments of cancer by x-ray today generally follows Coutard's fractionated process, while radiated rods are used in brachytherapy. The three main divisions of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers. Radioactive iodine, as developed in 1911, survives today primarily in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. Treatment involves the important iodine isotope iodine-131 (131I), often simply called \\"radioiodine\\" (though technically all radioisotopes of iodine are radioiodines; see isotopes of iodine).

After participating in the Mutiny on the Bounty on 28 April 1789, he remained in Tahiti rather than continuing on to the Pitcairn Islands with the inner core of the mutineers, and in 1791 voluntarily turned himself in to the seamen of HMS Pandora to face justice in England. He was court- martialed at Spithead in September 1792, sentenced to death, and hanged on 29 October. Questions continue as to the degree of Ellison's culpability in the mutiny. Mutiny Ellison, although he was only 15 years old when he was mustered aboard captain William Bligh's armed vessel Bounty as it sailed from Spithead for Tahiti, was already an experienced able seaman who had seen service in the merchant navy under Bligh in the West Indies. He was short () and was described as dark-haired and fair-skinned. In records of the outbound voyage, Bligh praised the lad as \\"improving\\" and \\"is a very good Boy and will do very well.\\"Alexander, Caroline (2003), The Bounty: the True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty Bligh also instructed his clerk, John Samuel, to teach \\"Writing and Arithmetick\\" to the illiterate teenager. During the Mutiny on the Bounty on 28 April 1789, Ellison was standing his watch as the ship's wheelsman, which gave him a vantage point to view the personal confrontation between Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian at the heart of the mutiny. Ellison described himself as continuing to obey the captain's orders to \\"clap the helm down\\". However, the young seaman then handed control of the helm to a mutineer, John Mills, and left the scene to ask for advice from a loyal crewman, Lawrence LeBogue. When the time came for Ellison to tell his story at his court-martial, he tried to portray this incident as an attempt to establish his loyalty; but LeBogue ‚Äì who would within minutes be set adrift with Bligh in the ship's boat ‚Äì was less than helpful or sympathetic to the confused youth: > He being wex'd, I believe, answerd me in a Sharp surly manner, told me to go > to hell and not bother him; this Reception from my old ship mate quite > Disheartened me from making an application to any One else. Ellison remained on the ship with the mutineers, but was allowed to remain on Tahiti by Fletcher Christian, and did not accompany Bounty to the Pitcairn Islands. He gave himself up voluntarily when HMS Pandora arrived in 1791, and was placed in irons as a mutineer. He subsequently survived the wreck of his prison ship, and was forwarded, still as a prisoner, to England for court- martial proceedings. Ellison faced his judges in September 1792.Alexander (2003) In his court-martial testimony, the loyal midshipman Thomas Hayward, who had also witnessed the mutiny, recalled seeing young Ellison holding a bayonet and saying of Bligh, \\"Damn him, I will be sentry over him.\\" Hayward also said he saw Ellison in a crowd of mutineers that were jeering their powerless ex-captain and \\"publicly insulting\\" him. Able seaman Ellison was seriously outranked by Hayward, who had been promoted to lieutenant, and had no means to hire counsel for his defence or to impeach this damning testimony. As a forlorn hope, the doomed man wrote out a paper for the Judge Advocate, pleading his case and describing the mutiny from his point of view. In this paper he concluded: > I hope, honorable Gentlemen, yo'll be so Kind as to take my Case into > Consideration as I was No more than between Sixteen and Seventeen Years of > age when this of [sic] done. Honourable Gentlemen, I leave my self at the > Clemency and Mercy of this Honourable Court. This plea appears to be Ellison's own work, as it contains phonetic misspellings characteristic of his Cockney dialect. It did not, however, save the seaman from the gallows. He was convicted of mutiny and hanged at Spithead on 29 October 1792. In popular culture The 1932 novel Mutiny on the Bounty, by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, portrays Ellison as a heroic character. His youthful optimism is depicted as raising the spirits of his fellow mutineer-prisoners, and his conviction and execution are characterised as a miscarriage of justice. In the 1984 film The Bounty his character is played by Dexter Fletcher, who later directed the 2019 film Rocketman.

He currently resides in the Tokyo area.  Education  Eftimiades graduated from George Washington University with a B.A. in East Asian Studies and the National Defense Intelligence College with a M.S. in Strategic Intelligence. He also did undergraduate and graduate work in Asia. He is a Visiting Research Fellow at King's College, War Studies Department, London, United Kingdom.  Government career  Nicholas Eftimiades' 30 year government career includes seven years at the National Security Space Office leading engineering teams designing \\"generation after next\\" national security space capabilities. He was also Senior Technical Officer in the Defense Intelligence Agency, Future's Division, and Chief of DIA's Space Division. He served as DIA's lead for national space policy and strategy development. Mr. Eftimiades has provided numerous briefings and testimony on national security, technology, and space exploration issues to senior policy officials and the U.S. Congress.https://fas.org/irp/congress/1998_hr/eftimiad.htm He testified before the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy He has sponsored and chaired international conferences on U.S. and foreign defense policy issues. He is a frequent lecturer and public speaker on future technology and societal changes and national security issues.  Chinese Intelligence Operations  Eftimiades first came into public view in 1994 with the publication of his book Chinese Intelligence Operations (Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland., March 1994).http://members.authorsguild.net/neftimiades/chinese_intelligence_operations_103786.htm The book is an examination of the structure, operations, and methodology of the intelligence services of the People's Republic of China. The book received worldwide recognition with the Chinese government declaring Eftimiades \\"an enemy of the people\\" in the People's Daily newspaper. To date, the book remains the only scholarly analysis of China's intelligence services and operational methodology. Chinese Intelligence Operations gained worldwide attention when one of the Chinese companies identified as having a relationship with China's intelligence services was identified as a donor to the Bill Clinton presidential campaign through the Democratic National Committee. This revelation resulted in Eftimiades appearing on TV, radio, and being quoted in newspapers. He appeared on CBS Evening News with Connie Chung, Dateline NBC, ABC's Day One, BBC America, National Public Radio and many other television and radio broadcasts. Some organizations protested the CBS news broadcast as being racist.

The story takes place 200 years in the future and centers on a man, his computer friends, a female companion and their quest to communicate with God.  Non-Profit Activity  In 2001, Eftimiades founded a non-profit educational organization entitled the Federation of Galaxy Explorers to inspire youth interest in science and engineering. Students in the Galaxy Explorers program attend after school \\"Mission Team\\" meetings where they participate in hands-on lessons that support National Science Education Standards. Mission Team members are rewarded for participation and achievements with ribbons, patches, medals, and certificates.

It was well above average in the number of tropical cyclones that formed, at 19. Even so, it was the first season on record in which the first eight storms failed to attain hurricane strength. The season officially began on June 1, 2011, and ended on November 30, 2011, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Arlene did not form until June 28\\\\. The final storm to develop, Tropical Storm Sean, dissipated on November 11\\\\. There were 19 named storms altogether during the season, including seven hurricanes of which three intensified into major hurricanes. Overall, 2011 tied 1887, 1995 and 2010 for the third most- active hurricane season since record keeping began in 1851; only 1933 and 2005 were more active. The two most significant storms, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Hurricane Irene was a powerful and unusually large storm that made several landfalls along the East Coast of the United States after peaking with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Tropical Storm Lee was a disorganized tropical cyclone that moved ashore into Louisiana before producing historic flooding in the Northeast United States as an extratropical cyclone. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post- storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

History The professional association began as the American Society for Medical Technology (ASMT) and is now known as the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science (ASCLS). ASMT was organized in 1933 and incorporated in 1936. Early on, members were required to be certified by the Board of Registry (now the Board of Certification) of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) to ensure credibility of the society. During the 1930s, ASMT activities included the inception of a journal, the establishment of a Constitution and Bylaws, the emergence of state charters, and educating the public about the profession. In 1947, ASMT held its first independent convention, compared to earlier national meetings which were held in conjunction with physician groups. During the 1950s, the ASMT Research Fund was established to advance research efforts. In 1962, qualifications for the clinical laboratory scientist (medical technologist) changed to include a baccalaureate degree and a new category of laboratory technician emerged.Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook Also in the 1960s, ASMT joined the International Association of Medical Laboratory Technologists. In the 1970s ASMT grew considerably in numbers (over 30,000 in 1976). The Professional Acknowledgment for Continuing Education (PACE) Program for validating and documenting continuing education was introduced, and the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) was formed as an independent accreditation agency.NAACLS official website Together with Central Michigan University, ASMT provided graduate programs for laboratorians to earn master's degrees in administration or education. The ASMT launched its Future Directions Plan, and Statements of Competence. ASMT initiated the formation of the National Certification Agency (NCA) to advance \\"certification for the profession, by the profession.\\" In the 1980s, the organization sponsored the Clinical Laboratory Educators Conference (CLEC) and the Legislative Symposium. ASMT also moved its offices from Houston, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to become more involved in influencing legislation to advance the profession. During the 1990s, ASMT changed its name to ASCLS and joined forces with the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) to hold one of the largest annual meetings of laboratorians in the country.

Although badly outnumbered, da Nova's bold tactics, better trained and prepared men, and superior weaponry proved decisive for the Portuguese to defeat the blocking force of Calicut, break out of Cannanore, and emerge victorious from the battle. The battle is also historically notable for being one of the earliest recorded deliberate uses of a naval line of battle, and for resolving the battle by cannon alone. These tactics would become increasingly prevalent as navies evolved and began to see ships less as carriers of armed men, and more as floating artillery.

The airport was known as the Klamath Falls Municipal Airport and consisted of gravel runways and one fixed-base operator. In 1942, the airport was selected as a site for a Naval Air Station. Known as NAS Klamath Falls during World War II, the airport was transferred from the U.S. Navy back to civilian use in late 1945. In 1954, the airport was selected as a site for United States Air Force base and the airfield returned to military control. The former naval air station was then placed under the jurisdiction of the Air Defense Command (ADC). The 408th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was activated at Klamath Falls Municipal Airport on 8 April 1956, being assigned to the 28th Air Division. In 1957, the airport was dedicated as Kingsley Field in honor of Lieutenant David Kingsley, who earned the Medal of Honor during World War II. The 827th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (later 827th Radar Squadron) was activated at Kingsley Field in 1957. While the administrative and support sections of the squadron were located on the airfield, the squadrons operational element and radars were located nearby at what was named Keno Air Force Station in February 1959. ADC reassigned Kingsley Field to the 25th Air Division on 1 March 1959; transferred to Portland Air Defense Sector on 15 April 1960; transferred to 26th Air Division on 1 April 1966; reassigned to 25th Air Division on 15 September 1969.

He later became a friar and priest of the Discalced Carmelite Order, who was instrumental in re-establishing his Order in both France and England. He was a popular preacher throughout Europe, and was instrumental in introducing the widespread practice of nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The cause for Cohen's canonization has been accepted for investigation by the Holy See. Life Early life and musical career He was born in Hamburg, one of the four children of David Abraham Cohen and Rosalie Benjamin, part of a large and prosperous Jewish banking family. Although not pious, his parents were members of the Reform Judaism movement there and taught their son Hebrew and the basics of the Jewish faith. A gifted student, at the age of 4 he began to study the piano, at which he soon became accomplished. Praised by his teacher, who had arranged successful concerts for him at the age of 7 in Altona and Frankfurt, he became the spoiled focus of the family's attention. From his teacher, he also acquired a serious gambling habit, which was to plague him for many years. At the age of 12, his mother resolved to take him to Paris to advance his musical training, against the wishes of her husband, who was experiencing financial difficulties. Undeterred, she approached the Grand Dukes George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in order to obtain their financial support for her son. Successful in her quest, she took her children and moved to Paris. The family arrived there in July 1834, only to learn that, as a foreigner, Hermann was denied admission to the famed Paris Conservatory. Franz Liszt Hermann Cohen, young pianist at Paris, 1835.This rejection led to a significant direction in Cohen's life. Rosalie Cohen was able to persuade the renowned pianist Franz Liszt to take her son on as a pupil. Despite his early reluctance, after hearing him play and taken by his good looks, Liszt accepted him as a pupil. Cohen soon became his favorite student. As Liszt himself had been nicknamed Putzig (German for \\"little cute guy\\") by his own teacher, Carl Czerny, he began to call Cohen Puzzi, a diminutive form of the word. Liszt accepted Cohen into his social circle, introducing him to his friends, the author George Sand and the radical priest, the Abb√© de Lamennais, who both also became charmed by the boy. Sand began to dote on the boy and called him Le M√©lancolique Puzzi. Lamennais gave the young Jewish boy an autographed copy of his work, Paroles d'un croyant‚Äîfor which the priest had just been excommunicated by Pope Gregory XVI‚Äîwith the inscription: Souvenirs offerts √† mon cher petit Puzzi. The following June, Liszt left Paris without warning with his new lover, the Countess Marie d'Agoult, and moved to Geneva, where he began to teach at the recently founded Geneva Conservatory of Music. Devastated by the sudden loss of his mentor, Cohen persisted in begging Liszt to allow him to join him there, to which Liszt eventually relented. Cohen's arrival in the Liszt circle in Geneva soon earned him the long-held enmity of the countess. His abilities continued to grow under Liszt's watchful eye. On 1 October 1835 Cohen played in a concert sponsored by the Princess Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso. Together with Liszt and two other pianists, he played in a four-piano Brilliant Potpourri on folk airs by Czerny. That same month Liszt entrusted the boy with 10 students of his own. At age 13, Cohen's career appeared headed for greatness. By then Cohen had become Liszt's constant companion, accompanying him and the countess on their holiday trips through the Swiss countryside. He was with them and Sand on a notorious trip to Chamonix. He later wrote, Circumstances led me into the interior of a family unsanctified by the marriage ties. As dissolute as the circle appeared to the world, Liszt felt himself responsible for the boy's moral as well as his professional development and Cohen was touched when Liszt gave him a Bible. Cohen felt a deep religious experience in the course of one trip, when Liszt played an improvisation of the Dies Irae from Mozart's Requiem on the Grand Organ of the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Fribourg. In 1837 Liszt and his circle returned to Paris, where the princess had arranged for a famed competition between him and his greatest rival of the period, Sigismond Thalberg. She came to know Cohen at that time and became a friend and patron. When his increasing debts threatened to drown him, she arranged for a concert, which was to prove unsuccessful, apparently due to his lack of training from the idle lifestyle of gambling and dissolution he had adopted. The shock of this failure led Cohen to return to Hamburg, where he sought help from his father. Alone and in financial straits himself, the elder Cohen had no interest in helping his son. Cohen then turned to a former patron, Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who sponsored several concerts for him to raise funds. They were successful enough to allow him to return to Paris. There he met a popular Italian singer named Mario, which whom he formed a partnership. The duo traveled to London, where Cohen improved his skills and experienced a number of successes with their concerts. Again saddled with debts, by 1839 Cohen began to be estranged from his mentors, both Liszt and the princess, as a result of his lifestyle. The Countess d'Agoult used an affair he had with a married woman in her campaign in an attempt to discredit him in Liszt's eyes, who nonetheless kept Cohen as his companion for his concert tours around Europe until the end of 1840. His ties to Liszt were not without their own consequences. Friedrich Wieck, father of the future Clara Schumann, began to criticize publicly both Liszt and Cohen in the newspapers in Leipzig. He was furious at Liszt for supporting Robert Schumann in his own lawsuit against Wieck: \\"To show cause why his twenty-year-old daughter Clara should not marry Schumann\\". Liszt shrugged off the charges but Cohen did not and took Wieck to court, where he won his case. The year 1841 saw a final rupture between Cohen and Liszt, when the teenager was accused of embezzling funds from some concerts Liszt had given in Dresden. He was unable to persuade Liszt of his innocence. He felt his life had been wrecked, later calling this experience the result of \\"a plot hatched in hell\\". He spent the next five years traveling around Europe with his mother and his sister Henriette, playing concerts and composing works for the piano. Conversion Cohen settled in Paris in October 1846, where he shared an apartment with an artist friend. The following spring he met and fell in love with a popular circus rider, Celeste Mogadar, with whom he shared a deep love of music. The relationship soon ended, however, when he broke it off abruptly, indicating that he felt called to place his life in the hands of God. Disgusted with his life, he began to seek spiritual guidance, visiting churches of the city, where he would spend hours in prayer. In May 1847, while playing the organ for a Benediction service in the former Church of St. Valerius (), he became overwhelmed by an intense experience of submission, which he again experienced at the same service the next day, at which time the thought came to him that he should become a Catholic. While he was in Ems, Germany, to give a concert, he was again overwhelmed during the services in a local church there and resolved to take this step. Cohen had never known a priest besides Lamennais and was confused as to in whom he could confide. He was introduced to Marie Theodor Ratisbonne, a fellow Jewish convert, who, in turn introduced him to the Abb√© Legrande. Under his instruction, Cohen was trained in the Catholic faith and was baptized, with the baptismal name of Marie-Augustin-Henri, on 28 August, the feast day of his namesake, St. Augustine. The baptism took place in the Chapel of Our Lady of Zion, in the presence of Ratisbonne, its founder, and many Jewish Catholics. At his baptism, he experienced an apparition of Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and a multitude of saints, all bathed in a brilliant light, as well as an overwhelming experience of love. Cohen received Confirmation the following 3 December from the Archbishop of Paris, Denis Auguste Affre. With the support of Jean-Baptiste de Bouill√©, the Archbishop of Poitiers, out of his own experience, he immediately began efforts to popularize the practice of the nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament by the general faithful. Cohen soon felt called to be a priest. He first approached the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Solesmes, who were known for their studies for the revival of Gregorian chant. They declined his application. Next he turned to Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire, O.P., who was in the process of re-establishing the Dominican Order in France, after its destruction during the French Revolution. He counseled Cohen to find an Order more monastic than the Dominicans. Cohen then explored the more austere branch of the Carmelite Order, the Discalced, (or Barefoot) Carmelites, who follow the reforms of the Spanish mystics, John of the Cross and Teresa of √Åvila, who was also of Jewish ancestry. He felt called to this Order, with its claim to having originated on Mount Carmel in Palestine, under the Prophet Elijah. Being a recent convert was a barrier to his admission, however, due to Church law, which required a personal visit to Rome to obtain a dispensation. Discalced Carmelite friar Cohen gave a farewell concert which cleared his debts, required before he could be admitted to the Order, in the days before the Revolution of 1848. Instead of joining the fight in the streets, he was at his favorite devotion, spending the night in adoration before the exposed Blessed Sacrament. He entered the Discalced Carmelite novitiate at Le Broussey, in Rions, France, on 19 July of that year. He received the religious habit on 6 October 1849, being given the religious name of Augustine Mary of the Blessed Sacrament. He professed religious vows as a member of the Order on 7 October 1850. He then began to study theology. In this he faced a major challenge, as his formal education had stopped at the age of ten. Having been granted an exemption from some of the required courses, he was ordained a priest on 19 April 1851. Once ordained, Cohen launched himself into a ministry of preaching, which was to lead him to all the capitals of Europe. He preached to thousands in Geneva, Bordeaux, Lyon, and in Paris before huge crowds in prominent churches, such as Saint-Sulpice and Sainte-Clotilde. The poet, Charles Baudelaire, wrote that he found Cohen's sermons fascinating. His fiery eloquence and the interest caused by his conversion made him a popular preacher, despite his limited studies. He became a main figure in the restoration of the Carmelites in France, taking an active role in the founding of several priories of friars in the south of France: Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre (1853), Lyon (1857) and a hermitage in Tarasteix, near Lourdes (1857). Reconciliation By 1852, Cohen and Liszt, who was known for his generosity of spirit, had renewed their association through correspondence. Cohen invited his former mentor to visit him in France, which Liszt, by then living in Weimar, was unable to do. Several years later, Liszt's daughter with the countess reported to her father that her mother had undergone a change of heart and had come to admire Cohen. Liszt returned the offer in 1857, pleading illness for not being able to travel. In June 1862, both Cohen and Liszt happened to be in Rome. By this time, Liszt was himself a cleric, being in minor orders and a Franciscan tertiary. They met for the first time in years, spending three weeks together, playing music and walking in the Coloseum. By that time, his mother, Maria Anna Liszt, had ceased to view Cohen with the antisemitism she had exhibited all her life prior to that. Mission to England Cohen's fame as a preacher led to an invitation by Cardinal Wiseman to come to England to re-establish the Carmelite Order, after its suppression in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, for which he received a special blessing from Pope Pius IX. He arrived in London in 1862, having ¬£7 (c. ‚Ç§550 in modern funds) to support his work. He opened the new priory with a public religious procession, the first held by English Catholics since the time of the Tudors. He gained further public attention to his ministry in 1864, when he faced a jeering crowd while administering the Last Rites to six Catholic sailors about to be hanged on the gallows of Newgate Prison. He was lauded for his bravery by The Times of London. Final days In 1867 Cohen retired to the hermitage he had founded in Tarasteix, France. During this period, his eyesight began to fail and he was diagnosed with glaucoma. Spurning the surgery prescribed by his doctors, he chose to make a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes. Bathing his eyes there from the miraculous spring attributed to the shrine, his sight was immediately restored. He then returned to his life of solitude in France fully cured, living there in peace for the next few years. Cohen's life was uprooted, however, by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when all German nationals were expelled from France. Even though he was exempted by the French government, and his surviving immediate family were living in France, he chose to go into exile in Geneva, Switzerland that following October. He soon heard of the large numbers of French prisoners being held in Spandau Prison, just outside Berlin at that time. Despite his failing health, he volunteered to minister to them, and moved to Berlin in November. He found a facility crammed with over 5,000 prisoners living in squalid conditions, of whom some ten percent were suffering from serious infectious diseases, including smallpox. As the prison chaplain, Cohen worked tirelessly to alleviate the needs of the French prisoners, distributing relief supplies in addition to his spiritual services. He said daily Mass, regularly drawing 500 attendees, and heard frequent Confessions. He administered the Last Rites to two prisoners with his own hands instead of the prescribed spatula. Within two months, he began to exhibit the symptoms of smallpox himself, dying on 19 January 1871. His remains were buried in St. Hedwig's Cathedral in Berlin. After the destruction of the church during World War II his remains were transferred to the cathedral cemetery. In 2008 his remains were exhumed and transferred to the priory in Le Broussey where he had entered the Carmelite Order.

Characters from other franchises have also been featured in some of the initial games, as well as in the Compati Sports series, such as Mazinger Z, Getter Robo, Devilman and Godzilla. It was the first video game series to involve a crossover between animated giant robots and live action tokusatsu heroes from different established franchises. The series makes this possible by using caricaturized versions of the characters (officially referred as \\"SD\\" or \\"super deformed\\" characters), which allowed the different heroes and villains to co-exist and interact with each other without the need to reconcile their contrasting styles, settings, or sizes. The first game in the series, SD Battle ≈åzum≈ç: Heisei Hero Basho for the Famicom, which mixed franchises that were originally licensed to Popy, was developed as a congratulatory present to Yukimasa Sugiura when he was promoted to president of Banpresto at the time, which was soon followed by series of spin-offs and related games featuring the same cast of characters that developed into the Compati Hero Series. The crossover was also possible due to Banpresto's parent company Bandai holding the merchandising rights for all the properties associated with this series. The series was successful with children thanks to the SD Gundam craze, but after the release of Charinko Hero for the GameCube, there were no new games afterward for nearly eight years. Banpresto released a new game in the series titled Lost Heroes, for the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Portable on September 2012.

Geology While visually striking and unusual, slot canyons are a common occurrence within the northern Rocky Mountains. These canyons show the characteristic of Karst topography and is common in this region due to its easily soluble nature. Flowing out of Medicine Lake, the Maligne River flows about 15 kilometers upstream as a full size river, but as a losing stream, quickly disappears into seeps in the ground and completely vanishes from the surface not far from the lake for most of the year. The smaller streams that feed the valley below that point rebuild the river by the time it reaches the top of the canyon. The river drops down the canyon and intersects the bedrock layers where the underground river flows. Also at this point numerous large underground streams join and greatly amplify the flow. The canyon is constantly being eroded by the churning and swirling of the water. The effect of this has made the width across at some points and a depth of . Limestone is one of the most dominant minerals within the canyon. It was deposited in a shallow tropical sea by plankton which secrete limestone.

Eight tropical cyclones are believed to have formed during the 1861 season; the first storm developed on July 6 and the final system dissipated on November 3. Six of the eight hurricanes attained Category 1 hurricane status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, of which three produced hurricane-force winds in the United States. No conclusive damage totals are available for any storms. Twenty-two people died in a shipwreck off the New England coast, and an undetermined number of crew members went down with their ship in the July hurricane. Based on maximum sustained winds, the first and third hurricanes are tied for the strongest of the year, although the typical method for determining that record‚Äîcentral barometric air pressure‚Äîis not a reliable indicator due to a general lack of data and observations. Four tropical storms from 1861 had been previously identified by scholars and hurricane experts, but three more were uncovered in modern-day reanalysis. Known tracks for most of the systems are presumed to be incomplete, despite efforts to reconstruct the paths of older tropical cyclones. Three systems completely avoided land. They all had an effect on shipping, in some cases inflicting severe damage on vessels. A storm in September, referred to as the \\"Equinoctial Storm\\", hugged the East Coast of the United States and produced rainy and windy conditions both along the coast and further inland. The last storm of the season followed a similar track, and affected a large Union fleet of ships sailing to South Carolina for what would become the Battle of Port Royal. Two vessels were sunk and several others had to return home for repairs. Ultimately the expedition ended in a Union success.

As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path. Judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which three of the eight known storms in the 1861 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos√© Fern√°ndez Partag√°s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag√°s also extended the known tracks of most of the other tropical cyclones previously identified by scholars. The information Partag√°s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete. Although extrapolated peak winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861, estimated minimum barometric air pressure listings are only present for the three storms that directly affected the United States. Two hurricanes during the year made landfall on the mainland United States, and as they progressed inland, information on their meteorological demise was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation is based on an inland decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of inland hurricanes. Systems Hurricane One The first tropical cyclone and hurricane of the 1861 season is believed to have formed on July 6, immediately east of the Leeward Islands. A 1938 publication documented the storm's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts, and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone, modern-day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when it affected those islands.Partag√°s, p. 1 After crossing the northern Leeward Islands, the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest, likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9. The majority of the storm's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based on reports from, and the effects on, three ships in its vicinity. On July 10‚Äîwhen the storm was approaching or at its peak intensity with winds of ‚Äîthe Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of the damage to the three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partag√°s's paper. The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12. Hurricane Two The Key West Hurricane of 1861 Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg A month after the dissipation of the first hurricane, another tropical storm formed north of Hispaniola on August 13. Ludlum (1963) described the \\"Key West Hurricane\\" between August 14 and 16,Partag√°s, p. 2 and it was determined that the system had, in fact, surpassed the threshold for hurricane status based on wind observations from two ships. The storm skirted the north coast of Cuba as it moved west- northwest and passed through the Florida Straits. On or around August 15, Havana, Cuba experienced heavy rainfall. Although the cyclone did not directly make landfall, it delivered hurricane-force winds to southern Florida. It turned more toward the northwest as it entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it began to gradually weaken. It is listed as having dissipated on August 17 in the northern Gulf. The hurricane damaged or wrecked numerous vessels. Six ships were wrecked or grounded in the Bahamas, and the crews of at least two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm, leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding the fate of the Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys. Hurricane Three The first storm to be uncovered in modern-day reanalysis existed in late August, and ties the July hurricane for the strongest system of the season in terms of maximum sustained winds. Its track is known between August 25 and August 30, during which time it progressed generally northeasterly from a point northeast of the island of Bermuda to the central northern Atlantic.Partag√°s, pp. 2‚Äì3 On August 30, the Harvest Queen recorded a barometer of on August 30; this report was a strong indication that the storm had attained hurricane intensity, although the system was likely undergoing its transition into an extratropical cyclone at the time.Partag√°s, p. 3 Hurricane Four The subsequent hurricane was also previously unrecognized until contemporary research, although the majority of its track remains unknown. The only indication that a tropical cyclone existed was the ship David G. Wilson, which was dismasted by a severe storm on September 17. As no other information is available on the hurricane, it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a single point in the central Atlantic (at 28.5¬∞N, 50¬∞W). Hurricane Five The first storm to directly strike the mainland United States was first detected on September 27, off the east coast of the Florida peninsula. The storm is estimated to have been a minimal hurricane based on observations from the ship Virginia Ann. Several other vessels encountered the storm along its track, including the steamship Marion, which experienced hours of violent winds, torrential rainfall, and frequent thunder and lightning. The hurricane curved north, then northeast, striking North Carolina that same day before speeding northeastward as it hugged the United States East Coast. Its track is only known through 1200 UTC on September 28. Ludlum (1963) refers to the hurricane as the \\"Equinoctial Storm\\", and describes its area of impact as the \\"entire coast\\".Ludlum, p. 194 In the aftermath of the Battle of Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia, Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio Infantry was camped south of the battle site, where he wrote about a \\"very cold rain-storm\\" in a September 27 letter to his wife Lucy. Conditions at the time were characterized by leaking tents and temperatures getting \\"colder and colder\\". Hayes wrote, \\"We were out yesterday P.M. very near to the enemy's works; were caught in the first of this storm and thoroughly soaked. I hardly expect to be dry again until the storm is over.\\" Strong winds buffeted the Burlington, New Jersey, area from early evening to midnight on September 27, uprooting trees and causing some damage to property. Further north, Boston, Massachusetts, experienced intense winds and light rainfall for about five hours starting at midnight, with no initial reports of significant destruction. Tropical Storm Six Two tropical systems are known to have existed during the month of October. The first was originally documented by Partag√°s (1995), who detected it based on a faulty report of a violent gale from a ship, the Mariquita. The report was said to have been from October 16, but given her arrival date in New York City four days later and her location at the time of her encounter with the storm, she probably encountered the cyclone much earlier in the month. The violent south-southwesterly gale lasted 15 hours when the vessel was probably located at 20.5¬∞N, 47¬∞W. The storm was initially assigned a single set of coordinates for October 6, and no attempt was made to reconstruct its track due to a lack of certain data on it. However, it was noted that a ship further north on October 9 experienced a heavy gale.Partag√°s, p. 5 Based on the likely correlation between the two ship reports, the storm's track was extended four days to late on October 9 in the Atlantic hurricane database. Tropical Storm Seven A 1960 publication mentioned a tropical storm near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina sometime in October 1861 without specifying a date. Newspaper reports indicate that ships mainly north of the Cape Hatteras area encountered strong northerly gales for several days starting on October 7, and winds in New York City persisted from October 7 to October 10 with a northerly component. Partag√°s (1995) noted, \\"These findings do not seem to support a tropical system but the author made the decision of retaining the storm [...] due to the lack of solid evidence against its existence.\\"Partag√°s, p. 5 However, little is known about the system, and its inclusion in the hurricane database is limited to a single point at 35.3¬∞N, 75.3¬∞W. Hurricane Eight The Expedition Hurricane of 1861 Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 101 The final storm of the season followed a generally north- northeasterly course from the Gulf of Mexico northward along the U.S. East Coast between November 1 and November 3, dissipating over New England. The storm crossed southern Florida, and based on observations from Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, and observations from the ship Honduras, it is believed to have attained hurricane intensity. The hurricane made landfall in eastern North Carolina and proceeded up the coast before crossing eastern Long Island and coming ashore in southern New England. Its demise on November 3 marked the end of the 1861 Atlantic hurricane season; the next tropical storm would not form in the Atlantic until June 1862. Two storm systems affected the region in the week following October 28, both of which influenced a Civil War expedition which was \\"the largest fleet of war ships and transports ever assembled\\".Ludlum, p. 101 The first storm, which is not recognized as a tropical cyclone, disrupted the initial assembly of the fleet on October 28. However, the fleet set sail the next day on its mission to attack Confederate forces (its destination was \\"supposedly a military secret\\"). On November 2, the expedition encountered the second storm‚Äîthe tropical hurricane‚Äîwhich wreaked havoc on the organization of the fleet and sunk two of its vessels. There was knowledge at the time of the series of storm systems, but few details on the condition and fate of the fleet, sparking great concern. Some of the other ships were forced to return home for repairs, but the majority rode out the storm successfully.Browning, pp. 29‚Äì30 The expedition proceeded onward and seized Port Royal Sound at the Battle of Port Royal. As described by Ludlum (1963), the hurricane is known as the Expedition Hurricane due to its influence on the fleet. However, the hurricane also had a significant impact on land. Earlier in the year, Union forces had captured the fort guarding Hatteras Inlet at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. In the early morning hours of November 2, high seas began to overwash Hatteras Island, \\"completely covering all dry land except the position of the fort itself\\". After four hours, water began to subside. Extremely high tides associated with the cyclone continued up the coast as far north as Portland, Maine. Storm tides at various points, including New York City, Newport, Rhode Island, and Boston, reached levels unseen for at least 10 years and up to 46 years. In New York, the storm persisted for 20 hours starting early on November 2; rising waters inundated wharves along the East and Hudson Rivers. Floodwaters flowed up to five blocks inland, and a popular bar located in a hotel became isolated by the flooding. In response, a man transported customers to and from the bar on his private boat at a cost of two cents per ride.Ludlum, p. 102 Strong winds in Brooklyn brought down trees and telegraph wires.Ludlum, p. 102 Infrastructure throughout the Tri-State area suffered. Parts of the New Jersey Railroad line were undermined, and the Shore Line Railway at Bridgeport was inundated. Flooding was also prominent in the New Jersey Meadowlands and along the Newark Turnpike and Plank Road, which was left temporarily impassable. Further east, the hurricane triggered coastal flooding along the shores of Long Island, while northeasterly winds blew several ships ashore along the northern coast of Long Island. The eastern side of the hurricane blasted the southeastern New England coast between November 2 and November 3, damaging over 250 vessels at Provincetown, Massachusetts, and running aground 20 others. Water from the Massachusetts Bay surged into the village of Wareham. In downtown Boston, the storm began late on November 2 and lasted until late the next morning, although the highest tides did not occur until after conditions had already cleared. Twenty-two occupants of the ship Maritania drowned when the vessel sank after striking a rock during the worst of the storm. At the time, she was located east of the Boston Light.

The field has a total productive area of over , most of which is intermingled with agricultural land uses; oil pumps and storage tanks are surrounded with row crops and orchards in much of the field's extent. Discovered in 1928, and with a cumulative production of of oil as of 2008, and having over in reserve, it is ranked 38th among California's oil fields by total ultimate recovery. p. 63. It is a mature field in decline, and is run entirely by small independent operators. As of 2008, there were 40 different oil companies active on the field, one of the most in the state for a single field.DOGGR (2008), p. 112-168 914 wells remained active on the field, averaging only two barrels of oil per well per day from the dwindling reservoirs.DOGGR (2009), p 89 Setting Oil well on the Edison field in an agricultural setting The field lies in the flat bottomlands of the lower San Joaquin Valley, east-southeast of Bakersfield just outside the outlying residential areas. A small portion of the field ‚Äì the Racetrack Hill area ‚Äì extends into the lower foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The active portion of the field is approximately long north to south by across, with the most productive portions to the east and northeast.DOGGR, p. 146 California State Route 58 crosses the field east to west, and California State Route 184, the Weedpatch Highway, runs north to south through the western part of the oil field. Terrain in the vicinity of the oil field varies from almost table-flat, in the valley bottomlands, to rolling hills in the northeast, with elevations ranging from approximately above sea level throughout the productive region. The land rises with a slight gradient to the east and northeast, in the direction of the foothills of the southernmost Sierra Nevada. Climate is typical of the southern San Joaquin Valley, and is arid. Temperatures in the summer routinely exceed on cloudless days. Rain falls mainly in the winter months, and averages annually. Freezes occur occasionally during the winter, and the winter months are also subject to frequent dense tule fogs, limiting visibility to near zero. Drainage from the field is generally into the irrigation canal system, but because of the flat surface gradient most rainfall soaks directly into the ground.Ecoregion description The air quality in the vicinity of the field, as recorded in the town of Arvin to the west, is among the worst in the United States.Thanawala, Sudhin. \\"Calif. Town Is Nation's Smoggiest\\", Associated Press. Geology The Edison field, like the other fields in the bottomlands of the San Joaquin Valley, consists of a series of oil pools embedded in various types of traps within a thick section of Cenozoic sediments lying on top of ancient metamorphic basement rocks of Jurassic age. These basement rocks, which in the vicinity of the Edison field are primarily green schist containing calcite seams, slope from northeast to southwest with a depth of in the northeast part of the field to in the southwest, a distance of about . The basement complex has a weathered surface, from long exposure to the elements tens of millions of years ago, prior to its subsiding into the sea and being covered with the sediments that now contain oil. In places the overlying sedimentary layers buttress against steeper portions of the basement schist, which when fractured may itself be an oil reservoir for hydrocarbons seeping upward from those buttressing units.White, J. Lloyd. Edison Oil Field: California Division of Oil and Gas, Summary of Operations. 1955. Vol. 41 No. 2, p 5-9 The overlying sedimentary layers are a mix of Holocene, Pleistocene, and Pliocene continental deposits and Miocene marine deposits. Oil pools exist both as lenticular accumulations within the units, trapped by stratigraphy, and as pools in structural traps along fault lines. The overall dip of the units within the field is to the southwest. Quality and characteristics of oil varies widely throughout the field, as would be expected given the widely dispersed nature of the reservoirs both in depth and lateral extent. Near the surface, some of the oil is heavy, with API gravity around 13, requiring steam injection in order to be efficiently produced. Some of the deeper pools contain light oil with gravity over 40.DOGGR, 147-164 The deepest well on the field was drilled by J. Ainslie Bell, reaching the Oligocene-age Vedder Formation at a total depth of .DOGGR, p. 147 History, production, and operations Racetrack Hill area of the Edison field, showing dispersed oil wells and steam pipes with expansion loops The Edison field was one of the last fields discovered in California during the boom period of the early 20th century. Unlike other fields alongside the Central Valley which either advertise their existence with tar seeps or with anticlinal hills which serve as a surface expression for the underlying oil- bearing structures, the Edison field is completely hidden underneath the valley floor. The discovery well for the Edison field was drilled by General Petroleum Corporation in July 1928; it produced of oil per day, an acceptable flow but no gusher; nevertheless it was sufficient to establish that an oil field lay below the flat farmland of the valley southeast of Bakersfield. Early well drilling in the area was almost always of a \\"wildcat\\" nature, with numerous failures, as finding oil-bearing units in the hidden structure was mostly guesswork, until enough borehole logs were available to begin to build a subsurface lithologic model.Kasline, Fred A. Edison Oil Field: California Division of Oil and Gas, Summary of Operations. 1940. Vol. 26 p 12-18 During the 1920s the price of oil dropped gradually with new discoveries, including giant fields in the Los Angeles Basin, the Central Valley, and Texas; and with the Great Depression, and the 1930 discovery of the enormous East Texas field, the price of oil dropped as low as ten cents a barrel.James D. Hamilton, \\"Historical Oil Shocks.\\" Prepared for Handbook of Major Events in Economic History, December 22, 2010. University of California, San Diego. Available here. Drilling during this period was greatly reduced, as the cost to open a new well was unlikely to be recouped unless an exceptional reservoir could be tapped, and few drillers were willing to take this risk, particularly in a field where success was so spotty. After the single well that opened the field's Main Area in 1932, no further wells were put into the Edison field until 1934, during which seven new wells became active, and in 1935 that number had risen to 46. Over the next several decades, new reservoirs were discovered and put into production. In 1935, Shell Oil Company successfully completed their first well in the West Area of the field, which would prove to be one of the most productive areas. Also in 1935, the small Northeast Edison field was discovered by Woodward Oil Company. The Racetrack Hill Area came online in 1944, the Jeppi Area in 1948, and in 1950 Richfield Oil Corporation, ancestor of ARCO and BP, found oil in the Edison Groves Area.DOGGR, 149, 151, 153, 157, 160, 163, 167 The field reached its peak production in 1953, a time when oil was flowing from all of these areas: in that year over were produced.DOGGR, 147 In the early 1960s, in an effort to restore declining production, several enhanced recovery methods were employed. The first waterflooding operation began in 1963 in the Portals-Fairfax area, and in 1964 both waterflooding and cyclic steam were in use in several areas of the field, with the steam recovery being used on the heavy oil reservoirs such as Racetrack Hill, where a steam system is still in place.DOGGR, 153, 157, 159 The major oil companies, and companies that are ancestors of today's major oil companies, gradually left the field in the decades following 1950. J. Paul Getty, Standard Oil of California, Richfield Oil Corporation, Shell and Mobil all once had holdings on the Edison field.White, plates following p. 12 and 16,showing lease and land ownership in 1955 Smaller independents absorbed these holdings, and in 2009 there were 40 separate operators on the field. Some of the largest of these at the end of 2008 were Vaquero Energy, with 352 wells; Naftex Operating Company, with 163, and Sequoia Exploration, Inc. with 93.DOGGR 2009, 161ff At the end of 2008, 914 wells remained active on the field, with a field-wide average water cut of 92%.DOGGR 2009, 89 In spite of the declining reserves, some independent operators continue to explore for oil. For example, in 2011 Tri-Valley Corp expanded its operations on the Claflin Lease in the Racetrack Hill area, with intent to drill 22 new wells.Tri-Valley Expansion Project: Business Wire at Bloomberg Notes References * California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III.

The provisions of the bill included a cut in the total amount of federal government spending, a cap on the level of future spending as a percentage of GDP, and, on the condition that Congress pass certain changes to the U.S. Constitution, an increase in the national debt ceiling to allow the federal government to continue to service its debts. The bill had the support of Republicans and much of the Tea Party movement. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 19, 2011,CNN. House passes GOP debt measure; Obama praises compromise plan. July 19, 2011 but was rejected by the President and the Senate. The Senate voted to table the bill on July 22. President Obama had promised to veto the bill had it proceeded further. History The House passed the bill on July 19, 2011 by a vote of 234-190 and the bill was sent to the Senate for consideration. The vote split mostly on political party lines with 229 Republicans and 5 Democrats voting for the bill, and 181 Democrats and 9 Republicans voting against. Two Republican 2012 presidential candidates voted against the bill: Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann. Paul did not support raising the debt ceiling as a matter of principle and Bachmann believed that \\"the motion does not go far enough in fundamentally restructuring the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars ...we must also repeal and defund ObamaCare [the Affordable Care Act].\\". The bill had little chance of becoming law. It was adopted by a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, but both the presidency and the Senate were controlled by Democrats, who strongly opposed the bill. Furthermore, because the bill made an increase in the debt ceiling contingent on the passage of a constitutional amendment, the bill would, in practice, have needed the support of two-thirds of each house of Congress in order to be effective. When the bill arrived on the floor of the Senate, Democrat and Majority Leader Harry Reid called the proposal \\"one of the worst pieces of legislation to ever be placed on the floor of the United States Senate.\\" On July 22, 2011, the Senate voted to table the bill (postpone consideration of the bill indefinitely). Voting precisely followed party lines, with 51 Democrats voting to table the bill and 46 Republicans voting to bring it up for debate. One media commentator stated that: \\"The vote handed conservatives a chance to showcase their strategy for restricting future spending in Washington, but it faced a veto from President Barack Obama, making it more of a symbolic vote for Republicans to put their mark on deficit reduction\\". Provisions The bill provided for an increase in the debt ceiling of $2.4 trillion, the figure requested by President Obama. However it tied this increase to a number of other proposals, including cuts in spending, a cap on future spending, and an amendment of the federal constitution. Cuts in spending The bill proposed to reduce total spending by $111 billion in FY 2012. The savings were divided as follows: * Reduce non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels, which saves $76 billion. * $35 billion cut to non-veterans, non-Medicare, non-Social Security mandatory spending. * Defense budget at President's level. Cap on future spending The bill proposed that federal spending would be scaled back based on the glide path for the fiscal years below as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP): * 2012, 22.5% of GDP. * 2013, 21.7% of GDP. * 2014, 20.8% of GDP. * 2015, 20.2% of GDP. * 2016, 20.2% of GDP. * 2017, 20.0% of GDP. * 2018, 19.7% of GDP. * 2019, 19.9% of GDP. * 2020, 19.9% of GDP. * 2021, 19.9% of GDP. Constitutional amendment Supporters of the bill advocated an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring a balanced budget and permanently restricting the authority of Congress to spend and raise taxes. An ordinary act of Congress cannot alter the constitution or obligate Congress to do so. However the bill was intended to encourage a constitutional amendment by requiring that the debt ceiling could not be raised unless Congress passed an amendment and submitted it to the states for ratification. The constitutional amendment foreseen by the bill was one that would: *Require a balanced budget, *Impose a constitutional cap on federal spending as a percentage of GDP, and, *Require that any future tax increases be supported by a supermajority of two- thirds in each house of Congress.

Hell Town Hell Town, Ohio is a village located on Clear Creek, known today as Clear Fork, near the abandoned town of Newville, Ohio.Case, \\"Description of Mounds and Earthworks in Ashland County, Ohio,\\" in Miscellaneous Papers Relating to Anthropology, 1883, p. 74. The site is on a high hill just north of the junction of Clear Creek and the Black Fork of the Mohican River. The reference to the village sitting on a \\"high hill\\" counters many popular misconceptions that the village was in low lying areas that would later be submerged by the damming of the ClearFork River to create Pleasant Hill Lake. Hell Town was located along a \\"war trail\\" used by Native Americans in the region, which ran from a point about south from Sandusky, Ohio, thence north-northeast into the Cuyahoga River valley. This trail was later used by white settlers and is today known as State Route 95. Rerouted in the 1940s, a portion of this old road and war path are buried under Pleasant Hill Lake.Cherry, The Portage Path, 1911, p. 64. Helltown (actually meaning \\"town of the clear water\\") was situated a mile below Newville, on the Clear Fork of the Mohican, in what is known as the Darling settlement. Helltown was abandoned in 1782, after the massacre of the Moravian Indians at Gnadenhutten and a new village (Greentown) was founded on the Black Fork, where a more favorable site for defense was obtained.

By A J. Baughman. CHAPTER XVI. Monroe Township [However, Baughman's assertions about that location, may have been based upon mere supposition, rather than indisputable fact; the prior historians seem to have been uncertain about its precise location.] Jerometown A village of the Delaware tribe, which (sometime prior to the year 1808, and probably after 1790), was located on the south (and western) side of the present-day Jerome Fork of the Mohican River. It was named for Jean Baptiste Jerome, a French-Canadian fur-trader (who never actually lived directly within the native-village); however, it should perhaps have been more appropriately named \\"(Chief, or Captain) Pipe's town\\". According to the local- histories: by the year 1808-09 early European-American settlers to the area of what is now Jeromesville in Ashland County, Ohio, on the Jerome Fork of the Mohican River found Delaware-tribe people living about three-fourths of a mile south-by-south-west of the present site of Jeromesville. Near that native village of \\"Jerometown\\" was the cabin of \\"Old Captain Pipe\\", (who, with small remnants of a Delaware-tribe, were still living near that village site until 1812.) [see \\"Mohican John's town\\", below.] Mohican Johns town Mohican John's town (or \\"Johnstown\\") was said, by 19th-century historians, to have been the same as the native-village of \\"Jerometown\\", located just south of Jeromesville, Ohio. However, surveys done in the 1760s (etc), located \\"Mohican John's town\\" in the vicinity of present-day Mifflin, Ohio. It is uncertain if the earlier (1760s) \\"Mohican John's town\\" Indian village had perhaps been later moved to the alternate location before the 1800s; or if instead, local- historians merely misinterpreted the earlier \\"John's town\\" (on the Black Fork of the Mohican) to be the same location as \\"Jerometown\\" (on the Jerome Fork of the Mohican). Regardless, the \\"Mohican John's town\\" of the 1760s (which was apparently mainly inhabited by members of the \\"Mingo\\" tribe), was undoubtedly upon the Black ForkHutchins 1760s surveys, and his resulting published maps of the Mohican River (and probably near present-day Mifflin, Ohio). Knapp's History of Ashland County (OH) accurately refers to the native-village near present-day Jeromesville as being named \\"Jerometown\\" by 1808. But Knapp's History errs in attributing the original village of \\"Mohican John's Town\\" (which was recorded in 1764 to be on the immediate 'east' side of the Black Fork) to be the same native village as Jerometown (which was consistently recorded to be on the near 'western' side of the Jerome Fork). The later historians Baughman's History of Ashland County never noticed Knapp's obvious contradiction, and they simply repeated (and expanded upon) his error. [Note: some of the early 'histories' implied that \\"Mohican John\\" (who was presumably of Native-American heritage) was the same person as John Jerome (a Caucasian of French heritage); but John (or \\"Jean\\") Jerome was not yet even born when \\"Mohican John's Town\\" was initially recorded to exist. That confusion about the two different men, may have resulted in the error about the actual location of \\"Mohican John's Town\\" (or \\"Johnstown\\") being the same place as the Native-American-inhabited village of \\"Jerometown\\" (near present-day Jeromesville.] Greentown Greentown was located west of Perrysville, Ohio. It was burned to the ground by Caucasian pioneer-settlers during the War of 1812 in August 1812; but its Native-American inhabitants had already abandoned it for safety, elsewhere. Greentown was said to be named for Thomas Green, a Caucasian, and who was a Tory, who after aiding the Mohawks in the Wyoming massacre of 1778 sought retreat and seclusion with the Indians in the west.Semi-Weekly News (Mansfield, Ohio): 02 August 1898, Vol. 14, No. 64 Coshocton Coshocton was settled in 1778, when Lenape leader, Pipe, and the warlike members of his tribe, departed from the Tuscarawas and relocated on the Walhonding River, about fifteen miles above the present site of Coshocton, Ohio.

He was the commanding officer of the 9th battalion, Maratha Light Infantry. On 31 July 2007, he was killed in action while preventing heavily armed infiltrators from crossing the India-Pakistan border at Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. As a result he was posthumously awarded the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration for peacetime gallantry. Early life Born to Praphulla and N.K. Venugopal in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, Vasanth Venugopal was the youngest of two brothers. His father's work required the family to travel throughout the state of Karnataka and Vasanth went to schools in Udupi, Shimoga and Bangalore. He graduated from MES College, Bangalore in 1988. While in college, he was a member of the National Cadet Corps, through which he participated in the Indo-Canada World Youth Exchange Programme of 1986-87. Military career Venugopal started training at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun in 1988. On 10 June 1989, he was commissioned into the 9th battalion of the Maratha Light Infantry as a second lieutenant. He was promoted lieutenant on 10 June 1991 and to captain on 10 June 1994. On 14 January 2000, Venugopal was promoted major, and was promoted lieutenant- colonel on 16 December 2004. In a military career spanning eighteen years, he served in Pathankot, Sikkim, Gandhinagar, Ranchi, Bangalore and various sectors of Jammu and Kashmir. \\"I go where my men go\\", he told his mother when she asked him if a colonel should participate in all operations conducted by his men. On 28 October 2006 he took over as the commanding officer of the 9th battalion, Maratha Light Infantry. The battalion was at that time posted in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. On July 31 2007, he and his troops surrounded militants in a forest and blocked all their escape routes in the Uri sector in Kashmir. Despite being wounded, the colonel and his men engaged the terrorists in a fierce encounter. The daring officer led from the front and helped gun down the terrorists. Tragically, he and radio operator L/Nk Bachhav Shashikant Ganpat were shot and died in hospital. \\"He ensured that all eight infiltrators were wiped out even as he laid down his life for the nation. He was a true soldier who was dedicated to the country and his force\\", Gen. Joginder Jaswant Singh, Chief of Army Staff at the time, said after Venugopal's death. Honours and legacy Col. Venugopal was cremated with full military honours on 1 August 2007 in Bangalore. He was posthumously awarded the Ashoka Chakra, the peacetime equivalent of the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for gallantry awarded for the \\"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\\" other than in the face of the enemy. Colonel Vasanth is the first person from the state of Karnataka, India to have received this honour.

Communication strategies are strategies that learners use to overcome these problems in order to convey their intended meaning.. Strategies used may include paraphrasing, substitution, coining new words, switching to the first language, and asking for clarification... These strategies, with the exception of switching languages, are also used by native speakers. The term communication strategy was introduced by Selinker in 1972,. and the first systematic analysis of communication strategies was made by Varadi in 1973.Although it was written in 1973, it was published as .. There were various other studies in the 1970s, but the real boom in communication strategy scholarship came in the 1980s. This decade saw a flurry of papers describing and analyzing communication strategies, and saw Ellen Bialystok link communication strategies to her general theory of second-language acquisition. There was more activity in the 1990s with a collection of papers by Kasper and Kellerman. and a review article by D√∂rnyei and Scott,. but there has been relatively little research on the subject since then.  Communication strategies  No comprehensive list of strategies has been agreed on by researchers in second-language acquisition, but some commonly used strategies have been observed: ; Circumlocution : This refers to learners using different words or phrases to express their intended meaning. For example, if learners do not know the word grandfather they may paraphrase it by saying \\"my father's father\\". ; Semantic avoidance : Learners may avoid a problematic word by using a different one, for example substituting the irregular verb make with the regular verb ask. The regularity of \\"ask\\" makes it easier to use correctly. ; Word coinage : This refers to learners creating new words or phrases for words that they do not know. For example, a learner might refer to an art gallery as a \\"picture place\\". ; Language switch : Learners may insert a word from their first language into a sentence, and hope that their interlocutor will understand. ; Asking for clarification : The strategy of asking an interlocutor for the correct word or other help is a communication strategy. ; Non-verbal strategies : This can refer to strategies such as the use of gesture and mime to augment or replace verbal communication.. ; Avoidance : Avoidance, which takes multiple forms, has been identified as a communication strategy. Learners of a second language may learn to avoid talking about topics for which they lack the necessary vocabulary or other language skills in the second language. Also, language learners sometimes start to try to talk about a topic, but abandon the effort in mid-utterance after discovering that they lack the language resources needed to complete their message.  Research  Research in communication strategies reached its peak in the 1980s, and has since fallen out of favor as a research topic in second-language acquisition. Some researchers who have studied communication strategies and their effect on language acquisition include Elaine Tarone, Claus Faerch, Gabriele Kasper, and Ellen Bialystok. Kasper and Faerch proposed a model of speech production that involved a planning phase and a production phase. Communication strategies were seen as belonging to the planning phase; their use became necessary if the learner experienced a problem with the initial plan that they made. In addition to the strategies outlined above Kasper and Faerch also pointed to the possibility of using a reductive strategy such as switching to a completely different topic. Researchers have identified three components of communication strategies: problematicity, meaning that the person recognizes a communication problem; consciousness, meaning that the person is conscious of the problem and is consciously employing a strategy to resolve it; and intentionality, which implies that the person is able to choose between options for overcoming a communication problem. However, Bialystok and other researchers have pointed out that communication strategies may be employed by language learners when there has been no breakdown in communications (no problematicity) and that language learners typically use the same small set of strategies routinely, rather than intentionally and consciously choosing to employ a communications strategy.. Some learners' interlanguages are characterized by communication strategies, and Larry Selinker has noted that they are one of the processes that leads to learner errors. Based on this observation, Rod Ellis suggests that the communication strategies that learners use may be characteristic of the stage of development which they have reached.

Many Lenape had migrated here after the American Revolutionary War from their traditional territory along the Delaware River and coast in the mid-Atlantic states. As a youth, Black Beaver began trapping and trading beaver pelts for the American Fur Company of John Jacob Astor, as the fur trade was still an important industry. Interpreter and scout Known to his own people as Se-ket-tu-may-qua, the young man became fluent in English, French, and Spanish, in addition to his native Lenape and about eight other American Indian languages. He used the common trade sign language to communicate with tribes whose language he did not know. His skills were invaluable to the many white settlers and military expeditions that were traveling west. He served the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition of 1834 and, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), led a unit of Indian volunteers as a captain in the U.S. Army. When Captain Randolph B. Marcy escorted the first 500 emigrants from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Santa Fe during the gold rush days of 1849, he engaged Black Beaver as his guide. On his return, Black Beaver took a shortcut across the prairie that reduced the two-month trip to two weeks. Thousands of emigrants followed this route to the west; it became known as the California Trail. After that Black Beaver settled near Fort Arbuckle, in south-central Indian Territory. He became chief of a Lenape village called Beaverstown. During 1849, 1852 and 1854, Black Beaver guided Randolph B. Marcy's exploration expeditions throughout Texas.Carol A. Lipscomb, \\"Delaware Indians,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed July 8, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In his 1859 guide book The Prairie Traveler, Marcy wrote that Black Beaver > had visited nearly every point of interest within the limits of our > unsettled territory. He had set his traps and spread his blanket upon the > head waters of the Missouri and Columbia; and his wanderings had led him > south to the Colorado and Gila, and thence to the shores of the Pacific in > Southern California. His life had been that of a veritable cosmopolite, > filled with scenes of intense and startling interest, bold and reckless > adventure.

His reputation as a > resolute, determined, and fearless warrior did not admit of question, yet I > have never seen a man who wore his laurels with less vanity. The truth is my > friend Beaver was one of those few heroes who never sounded his own trumpet; > yet no one that knows him ever presumed to question his courage.\\"Black > Beaver\\", in Randolph B. Marcy: The Prairie Traveler. (retrieved 19 July > 2011) By 1860 Black Beaver was the wealthiest and most well-known Lenape in America. He had settled in present-day Caddo County, Oklahoma and lived at Anadarko. The Lenape had been relocated here by the federal government during Indian Removal from east of the Mississippi. In May 1861, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, General William H. Emory, stationed at Fort Arbuckle, learned that 6,000 Confederate troops were advancing toward his forces from Texas and Arkansas. He gathered the soldiers from forts Washita, Cobb and Arbuckle near Minco, but to escape to Kansas across the open prairie he needed a guide. Other Indian guides turned him down for fear of reprisal by the Confederates. In addition, members of the Five Civilized Tribes: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek and other slaveholding tribes, had allied with the Confederates, who promised them an Indian state if they won the war. Emory guaranteed Black Beaver that the federal government would reimburse him for any losses, so he agreed to help. He scouted the approaching Confederate troops and provided information for Emory to capture their advance guard, who were the first prisoners captured during the Civil War. Black Beaver guided more than 800 Union soldiers, their prisoners, and 200 teamsters managing 80 wagons and 600 horses and mules in a mile-long train across 500 miles of open prairie to safety at Fort Leavenworth in eastern Kansas; he did not lose a single man, horse or wagon. He also freed multiple slaves from each of the Five Civilized Tribes. The Confederate Army and allied Native American warriors destroyed Black Beaver‚Äôs ranch and placed a bounty on his head. He stayed in Kansas until after the end of the war, when he returned to rebuild in Indian Territory. The United States government never fully compensated him for his losses. Rancher After the war, Black Beaver and his friend Jesse Chisholm returned and developed part of the Native American path used by the Union Army into what became known as the Chisholm Trail. They collected and herded thousands of stray Texas longhorn cattle by the Trail to railheads in Kansas, from where the cattle were shipped East, where beef sold for ten times the price in the West. The Chisholm Trail was used by other cowboys to drive millions of cattle to Kansas for shipment to the East. Black Beaver resettled at Anadarko, where he built the first brick home in the area. He had 300 acres of fenced and cultivated land as well as cattle, hogs and horses.Note: Jenny says they collected 3 million stray cattle, but since a contemporary account in the Handbook of Texas Online reports a total of 5 million cattle were shipped over the trail during its entire use, the Jenny account appears to be based on an incorrect source. Death and legacy Black Beaver died at his home on May 8, 1880, and was buried on his ranch. In 1976 he was reinterred at Fort Sill, in recognition of his contributions to the Union during the Civi War. His former ranch site has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Black Beaver was the first inductee in the American Indian Hall of Fame, located in Anadarko on part of his former ranch lands.Jenny, Walter, Jr. \\"Black Beaver‚Äôs Oklahoma legacy should not be forgotten\\", The Edmond Sun. 2 July 2007 (retrieved 19 July 2011) Se-ket-tu-may-qua is the name of a character in Mary Kathryn Nagle's play, Manahatta. His image was used in the set of the Yale Repertory Theater production of the show.

In 1988 or 1990 the twin headlights were changed, introducing single, \\"cats-eye\\" headlights (AM815). In 1994 the AM815 Hi-Combi was added to the lineup. For the 1996 model year another modification took place, introducing more modern smaller four-cylinder Hyundai engines with more power as well as a re-designed dashboard. These later models (AM825) also feature twin round headlights. The new inline-four engines included Hyundai's new turbocharged 3.3 L D4AL and 3.9 L D4DA, producing and respectively.

Its name in Chinese, the Huhang Line, is named after the railway's two terminal cities, Shanghai, whose Chinese character abbreviation is hu and Hangzhou. The line is long and was built from 1906 to 1909. Cities along the route include Shanghai, Jiaxing and Hangzhou. The line now forms part of the Shanghai‚ÄìKunming railway. Line history In 1898, the Qing government of China granted to Britain a concession to build a railway between Shanghai and Hangzhou. This concession drew strong domestic opposition against foreign ownership of railways. In 1905, the Qing government's railway construction policy shifted in favor of local provincial governments. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces received approval to build the Shanghai‚ÄìHangzhou railway and raised 4.84 and 3.88 million silver dollars, respectively, for the project through chartered companies. Construction began in September 1906 on the western (Hangzhou‚ÄìFengjing) section and in February 1907 on the eastern (Fengjing‚ÄìShanghai) section. The western section entered into operation in April 1909, the two sections were joined together in June and through-train operation began in July. The line was 186.2 km in length. After the Xinhai Revolution, the national government purchased the railway from the two province-chartered companies, and in 1915, the line was extended in Shanghai to join with the Shanghai‚ÄìNanjing railway at the Shanghai North railway station. During World War II, the line was bombed and rebuilt by the Japanese occupying forces. In the Chinese Civil War, Nationalist forces destroyed 16 bridges on the line to stall the Communist advance on Shanghai in the spring of 1949. Service was restored on August 1, 1949, and the bridges were fully rebuilt in 1950. The line was electrified from 2004 to 2006. In 2007, during the Sixth Railway Speed-Up Campaign, the line was organized into the Shanghai‚ÄìKunming railway.

It is situated near Khurrianwala and away from Lahore Zoo. It is the largest park of Faisalabad. Gatwala Forest Park is a huge compound of more than 100 km2 that houses forest areas, parks, lakes and administrative buildings of the Ministry of Forestry, Government of Pakistan. Situated on the Shiekhupura Road / Lahore Road, its distance from the Clock Tower, Faisalabad is almost 20 km. It is situated next to many residential colonies and towns of Metropolis of Faisalabad as a result of the extreme expansion of residential areas of Faisalabad. The main attractions in Gatwala Park are the huge green parks that house a few rides for children, flowing canals across the park, bamboo growing area, large forest areas and two lakes. Boating is done in one lake, whereas the other lake is the home to many crocodiles. Proper cordoning of the lake with crocodiles has created a safe area for people to view crocodiles from a distance. History The land where Gatwala Wildlife Park is situated belonged to Punjab Forestry Department. In 1985, the then government of Pakistan, declared Faisalabad a division and announced many upgrade projects. One of these projects was the development of a Wildlife Park in Gatwala. The overall development took 7 years and wildlife park was completed with all its facilities in 1992.  Facilities  Gatwala Wildlife Park is equipped with many facilities to make the visit enjoyable yet close to nature. The following recreational activities are available in Gatwala Wildlife Forest Park Faisalabad. Main Lake This lake lies at the northwest end of Gatwala Wildlife Park and is a good example of natural lake. The lake exhibits moss and tulip flowers and it is also possible to take an oar boat ride. Children Area The main attraction for children is the area in the center of the park that houses many rides, however, in order to maintain aura of natural wildlife, no mechanized ride is installed. Bamboo Forest In the east end of Gatwala Wildlife Park lies the Bamboo Forest area next to a flowing stream. It is a major attraction especially in the summer months because of its thick and cold shadows. Bird Sanctuary A large sized bird sanctuary lies on the northeast part of Gatwala Wildlife Park. This sanctuary houses many local birds species as well as a few from other regions of Pakistan. Crocodile Farm In the north end of Gatwala Wildlife Park visitors can visit a crocodile farm which is the home to many crocodiles and alligators.

It was discovered on 18 September 1982, by Belgian astronomer Henri Debehogne at ESO La Silla Observatory in northern Chile.  Orbit and classification  The C-type asteroid belongs to the small Baptistina family. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,254 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In September 2013, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations in the R-band at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. It gave an exceptionally long rotation period of 1917 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.04 magnitude (). However, the fragmentary light-curve has received a low quality rating by the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) which means that the result could be completely wrong (also see potentially slow rotator). CALL assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 5.71 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 14.49.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 28 September 1999. As of 2018, it has not been named.

It is one of the biggest lakes in Arkhangelsk Oblast and the second biggest one in Plesetsky District. The area of the lake is , and the area of its basin is . Lake Undozero is the source of the Undosha, which belongs to the river basin of the Onega and thus to the White Sea basin. The lake has a sophisticated shape and contains a number of islands. The source of the Undosha is in the south-western corner. The main tributary of the lake is the Lopa, which shortly upstream from the mouth accepts from the left a major tributary, the Yonza. There are three villages on Lake Undozero, Skarlakhta, Pogost, and Mezen. Skarlakhta is connected by the railroad to the east via the settlement of Severoonezhsk with the railway station Puksa located on the railway line between Vologda and Arkhangelsk. The same railroad continues west to the village of Yangory. There have been plans to extend it west to Medvezhyegorsk, but these have never been realized. The railway belongs to the Department of corrections, and as a matter of fact, there are settlements around the village of Skarlakhta inhabited by convicted criminals who have previously served a part of their jail term. There is a regular passenger traffic on the railroad. There was an air field in Pogost. There are no all-season roads connecting Undozero with the main road network. Undozero is popular as a starting point for rafting down the Undosha. Almost the whole course of the Undosha is not populated, with the exception of Lake Undozero and a number of villages close to its mouth at Lake Pochozero. (Downstream from Lake Pochozero, the Undosha changes its name to the Pocha and flows to Lake Kenozero). Therefore the rafters start in Skarlakhta and finish at Lake Kenozero. Before the railroad was constructed in the 1970s, the only way to get to Undozero for the rafters was to start in Severoonezhsk, take rafts upstream the Iksa, and them bring them to Undozero by land.

As the electric energy became an essential part of the daily life, its optimal usage and reliability became important. Real-time network view and dynamic decisions have become instrumental for optimizing resources and managing demands, thus making a distribution management system which could handle proper work flows, very critical. Overview A Distribution Management System (DMS) is a collection of applications designed to monitor & control the entire distribution network efficiently and reliably. It acts as a decision support system to assist the control room and field operating personnel with the monitoring and control of the electric distribution system. Improving the reliability and quality of service in terms of reducing outages, minimizing outage time, maintaining acceptable frequency and voltage levels are the key deliverables of a DMS. Most distribution utilities have been comprehensively using IT solutions through their Outage Management System (OMS) that makes use of other systems like Customer Information System (CIS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). An outage management system has a network component/connectivity model of the distribution system. By combining the locations of outage calls from customers with knowledge of the locations of the protection devices (such as circuit breakers) on the network, a rule engine is used to predict the locations of outages. Based on this, restoration activities are charted out and the crew is dispatched for the same. In parallel with this, distribution utilities began to roll out Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, initially only at their higher voltage substations. Over time, use of SCADA has progressively extended downwards to sites at lower voltage levels. DMSs access real-time data and provide all information on a single console at the control centre in an integrated manner. Their development varied across different geographic territories. In the USA, for example, DMSs typically grew by taking Outage Management Systems to the next level, automating the complete sequences and providing an end to end, integrated view of the entire distribution spectrum. In the UK, by contrast, the much denser and more meshed network topologies, combined with stronger Health & Safety regulation, had led to early centralisation of high-voltage switching operations, initially using paper records and schematic diagrams printed onto large wallboards which were 'dressed' with magnetic symbols to show the current running states. There, DMSs grew initially from SCADA systems as these were expanded to allow these centralised control and safety management procedures to be managed electronically. These DMSs required even more detailed component/connectivity models and schematics than those needed by early OMSs as every possible isolation and earthing point on the networks had to be included. In territories such as the UK, therefore, the network component/connectivity models were usually developed in the DMS first, whereas in the USA these were generally built in the GIS. The typical data flow in a DMS has the SCADA system, the Information Storage & Retrieval (ISR) system, Communication (COM) Servers, Front-End Processors (FEPs) & Field Remote Terminal Units (FRTUs). Why DMS? * Reduce the duration of outages * Improve the speed and accuracy of outage predictions. * Reduce crew patrol and drive times through improved outage locating. * Improve the operational efficiency * Determine the crew resources necessary to achieve restoration objectives. * Effectively utilize resources between operating regions. * Determine when best to schedule mutual aid crews. * Increased customer satisfaction * A DMS incorporates IVR and other mobile technologies, through which there is an improved outage communications for customer calls. * Provide customers with more accurate estimated restoration times. * Improve service reliability by tracking all customers affected by an outage, determining electrical configurations of every device on every feeder, and compiling details about each restoration process. DMS Functions In order to support proper decision making and O&M; activities, DMS solutions should support the following functions: * Network visualization & support tools * Applications for Analytical & Remedial Action * Utility Planning Tools * System Protection Schemes The various sub functions of the same, carried out by the DMS are listed below:- Network Connectivity Analysis (NCA) Distribution network usually covers over a large area and catering power to different customers at different voltage levels. So locating required sources and loads on a larger GIS/Operator interface is often very difficult. Panning & zooming provided with normal SCADA system GUI does not cover the exact operational requirement. Network connectivity analysis is an operator specific functionality which helps the operator to identify or locate the preferred network or component very easily. NCA does the required analyses and provides display of the feed point of various network loads. Based on the status of all the switching devices such as circuit breaker (CB), Ring Main Unit (RMU) and/or isolators that affect the topology of the network modeled, the prevailing network topology is determined. The NCA further assists the operator to know operating state of the distribution network indicating radial mode, loops and parallels in the network. Switching Schedule & Safety Management In territories such as the UK a core function of a DMS has always been to support safe switching and work on the networks. Control engineers prepare switching schedules to isolate and make safe a section of network before work is carried out, and the DMS validates these schedules using its network model. Switching schedules can combine telecontrolled and manual (on-site) switching operations. When the required section has been made safe, the DMS allows a Pemit To Work (PTW) document to be issued. After its cancellation when the work has been finished, the switching schedule then facilitates restoration of the normal running arrangements. Switching components can also be tagged to reflect any Operational Restrictions that are in force. The network component/connectivity model, and associated diagrams, must always be kept absolutely up to date. The switching schedule facility therefore also allows 'patches' to the network model to be applied to the live version at the appropriate stage(s) of the jobs. The term 'patch' is derived from the method previously used to maintain the wallboard diagrams. State Estimation (SE) The state estimator is an integral part of the overall monitoring and control systems for transmission networks. It is mainly aimed at providing a reliable estimate of the system voltages. This information from the state estimator flows to control centers and database servers across the network.Yih-Fang Huang; Werner, S.; Jing Huang; Kashyap, N.; Gupta, V., \\"State Estimation in Electric Power Grids: Meeting New Challenges Presented by the Requirements of the Future Grid,\\" Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE , vol.29, no.5, pp.33,43, Sept. 2012 The variables of interest are indicative of parameters like margins to operating limits, health of equipment and required operator action. State estimators allow the calculation of these variables of interest with high confidence despite the facts that the measurements may be corrupted by noise, or could be missing or inaccurate. Even though we may not be able to directly observe the state, it can be inferred from a scan of measurements which are assumed to be synchronized. The algorithms need to allow for the fact that presence of noise might skew the measurements. In a typical power system, the State is quasi-static. The time constants are sufficiently fast so that system dynamics decay away quickly (with respect to measurement frequency). The system appears to be progressing through a sequence of static states that are driven by various parameters like changes in load profile. The inputs of the state estimator can be given to various applications like Load Flow Analysis, Contingency Analysis, and other applications. Load Flow Applications (LFA) Load flow study is an important tool involving numerical analysis applied to a power system. The load flow study usually uses simplified notations like a single-line diagram and focuses on various forms of AC power rather than voltage and current. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation. The goal of a power flow study is to obtain complete voltage angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions. Once this information is known, real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined. Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance. The load model needs to automatically calculate loads to match telemeter or forecasted feeder currents. It utilises customer type, load profiles and other information to properly distribute the load to each individual distribution transformer. Load-flow or Power flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems. Volt-VAR Control (VVC) Volt-VAR Control or VVC refers to the process of managing voltage levels and reactive power (VAR) throughout the power distribution systems. These two quantities are related, because as reactive power flows over an inductive line (and all lines have some inductance) that line sees a voltage drop. VVC encompasses devices that purposely inject reactive power into the grid to alter the size of that voltage drop, in addition to equipment that more directly controls voltage. In the legacy grid, there are three primary tools for carrying out voltage management: Load Tap Changers (LTCs), voltage regulators, and capacitor banks. LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by ‚Äúgenerating‚Äù reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors are connected to the grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high voltage conditions by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment. The plan will give a required tap position and capacitor switching state to ensure the voltage stays close to its nominal value and thus optimize Volt-VAR control function for the utility. Beyond maintaining a stable voltage profile, VVC has potential benefits for the ampacity (current-carrying capacity) of power lines. There could be loads that contain reactive components like capacitors and inductors (such as electric motors) that strain the grid. This is because the reactive portion of these loads causes them to draw more current than an otherwise comparable, purely resistive load would draw. The extra current can result in heating up of equipment like transformers, conductors, etc. which might then need resizing to carry the total current. An ideal power system needs to control current flow by carefully planning the production, absorption and flow of reactive power at all levels in the system. Load Shedding Application (LSA) Electric Distribution Systems have long stretches of transmission line, multiple injection points and fluctuating consumer demand. These features are inherently vulnerable to instabilities or unpredicted system conditions that may lead to critical failure. Instability usually arises from power system oscillations due to faults, peak deficit or protection failures. Distribution load shedding and restoration schemes play a vital role in emergency operation and control in any utility. An automated Load Shedding Application detects predetermined trigger conditions in the distribution network and performs predefined sets of control actions, such as opening or closing non-critical feeders, reconfiguring downstream distribution or sources of injections, or performing a tap control at a transformer. When a distribution network is complex and covers a larger area, emergency actions taken downstream may reduce burden on upstream portions of the network. In a non-automated system, awareness and manual operator intervention play a key role in trouble mitigation. If the troubles are not addressed quickly enough, they can cascade exponentially and cause major catastrophic failure. DMS needs to provide a modular automated load shedding & restoration application which automates emergency operation & control requirements for any utility. The application should cover various activities like Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS), limit violation and time of day based load shedding schemes which are usually performed by the operator. Fault Management & System Restoration (FMSR) Reliability and quality of power supply are key parameters which need to be ensured by any utility. Reduced outage time duration to customer, shall improve over all utility reliability indices hence FMSR or automated switching applications plays an important role. The two main features required by a FMSR are: Switching management & Suggested switching plan The DMS application receives faults information from the SCADA system and processes the same for identification of faults and on running switching management application; the results are converted to action plans by the applications. The action plan includes switching ON/OFF the automatic load break switches / RMUs/Sectionalizer . The action plan can be verified in study mode provided by the functionality . The switching management can be manual/automatic based on the configuration. Load Balancing via Feeder Reconfiguration (LBFR) Load balancing via feeder reconfiguration is an essential application for utilities where they have multiple feeders feeding a load congested area. To balance the loads on a network, the operator re-routes the loads to other parts of the network. A Feeder Load Management (FLM) is necessary to allow you to manage energy delivery in the electric distribution system and identify problem areas. A Feeder Load Management monitors the vital signs of the distribution system and identifies areas of concern so that the distribution operator is forewarned and can efficiently focus attention where it is most needed. It allows for more rapid correction of existing problems and enables possibilities for problem avoidance, leading to both improved reliability and energy delivery performance. On a similar note, Feeder Reconfiguration is also used for loss minimization. Due to several network and operational constraints utility network may be operated to its maximum capability without knowing its consequences of losses occurring. The overall energy losses and revenue losses due to these operations shall be minimized for effective operation. The DMS application utilizes switching management application for this, the losses minimization problem is solved by the optimal power flow algorithm and switching plans are created similar to above function Distribution Load Forecasting (DLF) Distribution Load Forecasting (DLF) provides a structured interface for creating, managing and analyzing load forecasts. Accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of a utility company. DLF helps an electric utility to make important decisions including decisions on purchasing electric power, load switching, as well as infrastructure development. Load forecasting is classified in terms of different planning durations: short-term load forecasting or STLF (up to 1 day, medium-term load forecasting or MTLF (1 day to 1 year), and long-term load forecasting or LTLF (1‚Äì10 years). To forecast load precisely throughout a year, various external factors including weathers, solar radiation, population, per capita gross domestic product seasons and holidays need to be considered. For example, in the winter season, average wind chill factor could be added as an explanatory variable in addition to those used in the summer model. In transitional seasons such as spring and fall, the transformation technique can be used. For holidays, a holiday effect load can be deducted from the normal load to estimate the actual holiday load better. Various predictive models have been developed for load forecasting based on various techniques like multiple regression, exponential smoothing, iterative reweighted least-squares, adaptive load forecasting, stochastic time series, fuzzy logic, neural networks and knowledge based expert systems. Amongst these, the most popular STLF were stochastic time series models like Autoregressive (AR) model, Autoregressive moving average model (ARMA), Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and other models using fuzzy logic and Neural Networks. DLF provides data aggregation and forecasting capabilities that is configured to address today‚Äôs requirements and adapt to address future requirements and should have the capability to produce repeatable and accurate forecasts. Standards Based Integration In any integrated energy delivery utility operation model, there are different functional modules like GIS, Billing & metering solution, ERP, Asset management system that are operating in parallel and supports routine operations. Quite often, each of these functional modules need to exchange periodic or real time data with each other for assessing present operation condition of the network, workflows and resources (like crew, assets, etc.). Unlike other power system segments, distribution system changes or grows every day, and this could be due to the addition of a new consumer, a new transmission line or replacement of equipment. If the different functional modules are operating in a non-standard environment and uses custom APIs and database interfaces, the engineering effort for managing shall become too large. Soon it will become difficult to manage the growing changes and additions which would result in making system integrations non- functional. Hence utilities cannot make use of the complete benefit of functional modules and in some cases; the systems may even need to be migrated to suitable environments with very high costs. As these problems came to light, various standardization processes for inter application data exchanges were initiated. It was understood that a standard based integration shall ease the integration with other functional modules and that it also improves the operational performance. It ensures that the utility can be in a vendor neutral environment for future expansions, which in turn means that the utility can easily add new functional modules on top of existing functionality and easily push or pull the data effectively without having new interface adapters. IEC 61968 Standards Based Integration IEC 61968 is a standard being developed by the Working Group 14 of Technical Committee 57 of the IEC and defines standards for information exchanges between electrical distribution system applications. It is intended to support the inter-application integration of a utility enterprise that needs to collect data from different applications which could be new or legacy. As per IEC 61968, a DMS encapsulates various capabilities like monitoring and control of equipment for power delivery, management processes to ensure system reliability, voltage management, demand-side management, outage management, work management, automated mapping and facilities management. The crux of IEC 61968 standards is the Interface Reference Model (IRM) that defines various standard interfaces for each class of applications. Abstract (Logical) components are listed to represent concrete (physical) applications. For example, a business function like Network Operation (NO) could be represented by various business sub-functions like Network Operation Monitoring (NMON), which in turn will be represented by abstract components like Substation state supervision, Network state supervision, and Alarm supervision. IEC 61968 recommends that system interfaces of a compliant utility inter-application infrastructure be defined using Unified Modelling Language (UML). UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques that can be used to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems. The IEC 61968 series of standards extend the Common Information Model (CIM), which is currently maintained as a UML model, to meet the needs of electrical distribution. For structured document interchange particularly on the Internet, the data format used can be the Extensible Markup Language (XML). One of its primary uses is information exchange between different and potentially incompatible computer systems. XML is thus well-suited to the domain of system interfaces for distribution management. It formats the message payloads so as to load the same to various messaging transports like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), etc. References  External links  * IEEE Power & Energy Society * IEC- International Standards and Conformity Assessment for all electrical, electronic and related technologies * Government of India's multi million dollar Power Development & Reform Program Category:Automation ","title":"Distribution management system"},{"id":"32473017","text":"Losing Sleep may refer to:: Music Albums * Losing Sleep (Axle Whitehead album), 2008 * Losing Sleep (Edwyn Collins album), 2010, or its title track * Losing Sleep (Parachute album), 2009 * Losing Sleep (Chris Young album), 2017 Songs * \\"Losing Sleep\\" (John Newman song), 2013 * \\"Losing Sleep\\" (Chris Young song), 2017 * \\"Losing Sleep (Still, My Heart)\\", a composition by Vangelis Other *Insomnia ","title":"Losing Sleep"},{"id":"32473033","text":"Thomas Basil Humphreys (March 10, 1840 - August 26, 1890) was an English-born miner, auctioneer and political figure in British Columbia.

He was born in Liverpool, the son of John Basil Humphreys and Mary Elizabeth Morgan, and was educated at Walton-on-the-Hill. Humphreys came to British Columbia by way of California in 1858. The following year, he was hired as a constable in Fort Hope, later transferring to Port Douglas. Humphreys resigned this job in 1860, returning to mining until 1864. He then worked as an auctioneer and conveyancer, soon afterwards moving to Lillooet. Humphreys first marriage was to Fanny Cunningham, with whom they had one child, Josephine Virginia Edwards, born in 1868https://missionarchives.com/documents/pandp-bios/1996-Josephine- Edwards.pdf. He later married Caroline \\"Carrie\\" Watkins in 1873. In 1868, he was elected to the Legislative Council of British Columbia for Lillooet. Humphreys supported union with Canada. In April 1870, he was suspended from council after criticizing Joseph William Trutch and other members of the Legislative Council at a public meeting. He was reelected to the council by his constituents in November that same year. Humphreys moved the confidence motion which brought down the government of John Foster McCreight in 1872 but soon joined the opposition after he was not named to cabinet. In February 1876, he was named Minister of Finance and Agriculture in the provincial cabinet but he resigned in July, again joining the opposition. From 1878 to 1882, Humphreys served as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Mines. He was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1882 and again in a by-election later that same year in Yale. In 1886, Humphreys can unsuccessfully in Victoria District and then was defeated again when he ran for a federal seat. He was elected to the assembly for Comox in a December 1887 by-election held after Anthony Maitland Stenhouse resigned his seat to become a Mormon.

The building was previously the main orangery of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium and even as part of the garden had hosted cultural events. In 1958, the National Botanic Garden of Belgium moved to Meise, outside of Brussels. Le Botanique opened in 1984, and the gardens in front are now the Botanical Garden of Brussels. History The first botanic garden in Brussels belonged to the √âcole centrale du D√©partement de la Dyle that was created during the French rule of Belgium at the end of the 18th century. Due to their costs, those French schools were soon dropped and some municipalities, including the City of Brussels, took over the garden that was about to be abandoned. In 1815, Belgium became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Around the same period, the maintenance costs of the garden were regarded as too high by the city administration. A group of local bourgeois decided to create a new kind of botanical garden in Brussels. At the time the bourgeoisie was the new leading-class and since companies were popular financing method the garden was created as a company. The creators thought it would be their contribution to the city's reputation. Although it was rooted on a private enterprise, it was also supposed to be a national institution dedicated to science. Both the City and the Home Office supported it financially. But, the Independence of Belgium (1830-1831) was detrimental to the Dutch-born institution: it was regarded as Orangist, as a mere playground for the local elites, and as not useful for the country's agriculture, among other critiques. From then on, the garden would have to battle to survive. The state and the city did not want to support it anymore unless it proved useful to the whole country, so the Garden was obliged to develop its commercial activities. It sold plants by the thousands, and created several money-consuming attractions and events for the local √©lite, like aquaria, a dance room, fairs, a fish nursery, concerts etc. In the 1860s, the aging buildings required renovation. The board of the Society of Horticulture tried to raise the money, but the costs were just too high for the company. In 1870, the Belgian Government took over the company. The National Botanic Garden was created in the very same year. Barth√©lemy Dumortier (1797-1878), a Belgian politician and botanist, had played a major role in this process. He wanted a \\"Belgian Kew\\" to be created in the capital of Belgium, that is to say a botanical garden dedicated to taxonomy. That is why, some months before the garden was bought by the state, the Belgian Government had purchased the famous von Martius Herbarium that was held in Munich. So, in 1870, Belgium had a great herbarium and an appropriate building. This was the dawn of a new era for Belgian botany. Image:Botanique_Rotonde.jpg|The Rotunda Image:Botanique_-_binnen.jpg|Indoor Cultural centre Since 1984, Le Botanique has been the cultural centre for the French Community of Belgium. Nowadays it features a busy schedule of concerts, most taking place in either the 700-capacity Orangerie, the tall, circular Rotonde with space for 250 or the vaulted Witloof Bar with 200 standing places. Other rooms in the building are typically used for art exhibitions or film screenings. In addition Le Botanique manages the concert agenda for the nearby Cirque Royal, a hall able to hold seated audiences of 2000, or more standing. The annual Les Nuits Botanique ('Botanique nights') festival, held during the spring, sees a large number of musicians performing. In addition to the regular rooms, a marquee is frequently erected in the garden.

It is located in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, on Salonika Street. The College provides a religious and general education for day and boarding students from Year 7 to Year 12. The school was established in 1960 at its site in the central Darwin suburb of The Gardens.  History  St John's College was originally established for boys only by the Bishop of Darwin, John Patrick O'Loughlin, in 1960, on a site adjacent to the Darwin Botanical Gardens. Father John Burford MSC was appointed the first Rector of the college which operated out of buildings next to St Marys Cathedral, whilst building commenced. In this respect the college would continue to be operated by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. By December 1960 enough had been completed to allow the school to move into its site. From 1961 and 1966 the college continued to grow, eventually welcoming the arrival of the first college boarders. In 1972 the Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College for girls was opened on the Mindil beach side of the site, operated by the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. In December 1974, Cyclone Tracy devastated the college buildings and as a result reconstruction became a major focus of the college. In 1975, it was decided that the two colleges would be merged as a co-educational college with two schools, a Middle school and a Senior school. With 1975 being the college's 25th anniversary, it was commemorated by the construction of Jubilee Hall. The 1970s also saw the phasing out of primary schooling and the school head changing from Rector to Principal. In 1989 a College Board was established and St John's was confirmed as an independent school of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. However, with the departure of Principal Father Robert Irvine at the end of the 1990s, the direct association of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart within the college ended and led to the appointment of the first lay Principal, Gerard Keating. Symbols The college crest is emblazoned with an eagle, which alludes to artistic representations of the college's namesake, Saint John the Evangelist, which in turn symbolises the heights to which he rose in the first chapter of his Gospel. The quill held by the eagle represents the word of God. The motto of the College, \\"Strong in Faith\\", reflects the ethos of the college and also the religious foundations of the school.

It has applications in several occupations, sports and recreational activities. Scope Safety at sea Beach safety River safety Swimming pool safety Home safety Occupational safety Associated industries Manufacture of marine and aquatic safety equipment Associated occupations Lifeguard Air-sea rescue A Royal Navy rescue helicopter in action above a boat Auckland Rescue Helicopter in action Air-sea rescue (ASR or A/SR, also known as sea-air rescue ) is the coordinated search and rescue (SAR) of the survivors of emergency water landings and people who have survived the loss of their seagoing vessel or are otherwise in peril at sea. ASR can involve a wide variety of resources including seaplanes, helicopters, submarines, rescue boats and ships. Specialized equipment and techniques have been developed. Military and civilian units can perform air-sea rescue. Air- sea rescue operations carried out during war have saved valuable trained and experienced airmen. Moreover, the knowledge that such operations are being carried out greatly enhanced the morale of the combat aircrew faced not only with the expected hostile reaction of the enemy but with the possible danger of aircraft malfunction during long overwater flights. Coastguard Lifeboat service A rescue lifeboat is a rescue craft which is used to attend a vessel in distress, or its survivors, to rescue crew and passengers. It can be hand pulled, sail powered or powered by an engine. Lifeboats may be rigid, inflatable or rigid-inflatable combination hulled vessels. There are generally three types of boat, inland (used on lakes and rivers), inshore (used in coastal waters) and offshore (into deeper waters and further out to sea). A rescue lifeboat is a boat designed with specialised features for searching for and rescuing people in peril at sea or in estuaries. Where practicable, lifeboats will usually perform minor salvage and towing operations to assist mariners in distress and prevent navigational hazards. Paramedic services Education and training The World Health Organization has reported that drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths. Education and training in water safety is intended to help prevent and raise awareness of accidental drownings and other water related deaths and may include but is not limited to pool, boating, and flood safety. Organizations that offer education and training include the American Red Cross, World Health Organization, and Royal Life Saving Society UK, but can also include for- profit businesses. Educational tools used can include books, songs, and awareness campaigns that are targeted towards high-risk communities. Material can be tailored to the types of most common water related injuries and death that a community will experience, as well as information as to which portion of is at the highest risk. Advice given in educational materials can include content such as safe pool practices, how to avoid boating hazards, and what to do during a flood or flood warning. Examples of campaigns include Weather.gov's \\"Turn around and don't Drown\\" campaign, which educates people on the danger of driving into flood waters. Water safety organisations There are many government and non-government bodies in the field of water safety, including maritime search and rescue organisations, lifeguard associations, and other safety organisations for which water safety is just part of their scope.

'amazingtunes.com' launched as a beta website in 2006. In 2007 it was spun off as a separate company, The Amazing Media Group. In 2009 Amazing Radio launched, a national digital station broadcasting 100% new music drawn from amazingtunes.com. In 2010 it launched Amazing Instore, delivering new music to shops and business premises, and The Amazing Chart, an unsigned chart published weekly by the European music industry journal Music Week.

With the defeated and angry fans waiting for Maurice after the game, the team's physical therapist manages to sneak him and Martine out of the stadium in a van. The couple go to the local studios of FR3 (a fictionalized depiction of the real television channel: France 3) where Maurice takes part in a round table discussing football. Rico and his gang go to a pizza restaurant, where they see Maurice on the television. Hearing what Maurice is saying, they becoming increasingly agitated, shouting insults at his image on the television. Angrily, they set off to the TV studio to find him. Maurice and his girlfriend manage to flee to a shopping center. The gang follow them into the center, then spread out to search, using an alarm signal to keep in touch. During the search Rico accidentally kills B√©ru, a fellow gang member, and blames the murder on Maurice. Determined to avenge their friend, Rico and the gang comb the stadium entrance for any trace of the referee. Their search eventually leads them to Martine's home. When they arrive at her home, they find Martine and Maurice inside. The gang cut the power to the house and set about trying to gain entrance using any means possible, with Rico attacking the door with a blowtorch. Martine alerts the neighbors, and manages to injure Rico's hand. She is then able to flee the house with Maurice, who has managed to stop two of the gang members from gaining entry, and the couple climb to the top of the building to escape the attack. As the assault continues, Martine's sister is attacked, but is rescued by Maurice. One of the supporters dies from a fall after coming to the realization that it was in fact Rico who had killed B√©ru. The gang continues to ransack the neighbors' apartments, going so far as to attack some of them. The pursuit continues into a factory, where the gang beats up a security guard, while Maurice gets rid of two of their supporters. Rico catches up with the couple, in the factory, and threatens them with an axe, but Granowski arrives with other police personnel before he can carry out his threat. One of the supporters, Mayor, is armed with a gun. He shoots at Maurice, then refuses to give himself up and is killed by Granowski. Maurice and Martine flee in a car, with Rico hot on their heels in his gang's bus. After a pursuit around a large construction site, Rico knocks the couple's car off a ledge with his bus. The car falls a few meters to the ground, apparently killing its two occupants. Granowski arrives at the scene moments later in his car. With his mission accomplished, Rico walks away from the scene, gleefully ranting, raving, gesturing, and proffering insults to the excavation workers around him. A police car is seen catching up with him just as the film ends.

In 2006 French newspaper Lib√©ration described the film as a disturbing, and still relevant, satire on the fanaticism of football supporters, and the director Jean-Pierre Mocky as one of the rare French film makers capable of making such a high-caliber, risk-taking social drama.

It was situated in the Abbey Gateway, St Albans, a part of the Benedictine Monastery of St Albans. The name of the printer is unknown, only referred to by Wynkyn de Worde in a reprinting of one of the St Albans books as 'Sometime schoolmaster'. He has sometimes been identified as John Marchall, master of St Albans School; however, a passage written by Worde in 1497 implies that the printer was deceased, and Marchall is known to have lived until 1501. Recent research has produced the name John Haule as a possible candidate for the Schoolmaster Printer. He presented the school with its first printed textbook, the Elegantiolae, which was the first book printed at the press, and he was a printer, probably in St Albans in 1479. However, the historian Nicholas Orme, in his ‚ÄúMedieval Schools, From Roman Britain to Renaissance England‚Äù, states, ‚ÄúBooks were also acquired by schools and institutions. One of the earliest known is a Priscian Major [the first sixteen books of Priscian's Latin grammar, the Institutiones grammaticae] given to St Albans school by John Haule, apparently before 1310.\\" Orme was citing the register of the abbots of St Albans: ‚ÄúItem, Johannes Haule praedictis Scolis dedit Priscianum magnum.‚ÄùHenry Thomas Riley, editor, Chronica Monasterii S. Albani, Registra Quorundam Abbatam Monasterii S. Albani, Qui Saeculo XVmo Floruere, Volume 2, Longman & Co.

During the first phase, from 1479 to 1481, they printed six books in Latin for grammar school and university students, with a high standard of typesetting and printing. Then there was an interval of five years, after which printing resumed in 1486. During the second phase, they printed two books in English for a more general audience, with a lower standard of technical skill. One possible candidate for the Schoolmaster Printer is William Waren.Journal of the Printing Historical Society, New Series, No. 24, Summer 2016, ‚ÄúPrinters, stationers and bookbinders in the plea rolls of the Court of Common Pleas, 1460-1540‚Äù, by Vance Mead, pages 31-32 He was identified as William Waren, Master of Grammar and warden of the Grammar School of St Albans in a case in Common Pleas recorded from 1486 to 1489. He was the plaintiff against the Abbot of St Albans for a debt of 36 pounds. William Waren was awarded Master of Grammar at Cambridge in 1468-9. In his will, written in February and proven in March 1489/90, he requests to be buried in the nave of the Abbey church. There was another printer active in St Albans in the 1530s.Ibid page 16 In cases in Common Pleas in 1535, he is recorded as Richard Baugh, of St Albans, printer, and as Richard Baugh alias Waters, of St Albans, stationer. Works There are eight known printed works which came from the press: * Elegantiolae, Augustinus Datus (Agostino Dati, 1420‚Äì1478), about 1479. This work was a standard school text of the period, printed in very many editions. * De modis significandi, seu Grammatica speculativa, Thomas de Erfordia, 1480. * Margarita eloquentiae, sive Rhetorica nova, Laurentius Gulielmus Traversanus de Saona, 1480. The author Lorenzo Guglielmo Traversagni (1425‚Äì1503) was a Franciscan and humanist, and this work was a shorter version of his book on rhetoric. * Quaestiones super Physica Aristotelis, Johannes Canonicus, 1481. The author was writing in the 1320s. * Exempla Sacrae Scripturae ex utroque Testamento collecta, Nicolaus de Hanapis, 1481. This was a work from the 13th century; the author, a French Dominican, became Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. * Scriptum in logica sua, Antonius Andreae, about 1481-82. * The Chronicles of England, about 1486.

The building served as the superintendent's house for the North Star Mine. Commissioned by Superintendent Arthur De Wint Foote and his wife, Mary Hallock Foote (\\"Molly\\"), an author and illustrator, it was designed in 1905 by the architect Julia Morgan. This was her first significant, large- scale, residential project. The house is notable for its relationship to the literary career of Molly Foote and the master architect, Morgan. Geography The house is located at 12075 Old Auburn Road, near the Nevada County Fairgrounds. Situated on a site, the property is on a hillside that overlooks foothills and a valley. To the south is Quail Valley Golf Club. History The North Star Mine was the second largest producer of gold during the California Gold Rush. The Footes originally lived on the mine property for 10 years with their three children in a cottage. When Foote and his wife decided they needed a home to entertain the investors, dignitaries and celebrities that were coming to the Gold Country, they hired Morgan to design it. Built in 1905, it was one of her first projects. While living in the house Mary Foote wrote her lifetime reminiscences which form her published memoirs, A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West. From the time of construction to 1968, the residence was occupied by the Foote family. In 1968, the property was purchased and served as a private religious school for boarding students during the 1970s, and as a school for troubled youths from 1970 through the early 1980s. It attracted youths as far away as Michigan after it became known as a non traditional Christian church. It was operated by a renegade Baptist preacher called Rev. Bill. By the late '70s rumors were circulating about unorthodox dealings with the youths at the school. The school eventually closed. Rev Bill was never heard from again. Local legend says that there was ritualistic practices going on, locking up children and brainwashing them into occult practices. To the locals this place is known as The Devil's Mansion. Now operated as an event center by a non-profit organization, it is currently the home of the weekly Nevada County Growers Market. The North Star House was the setting for Wallace Stegner‚Äôs Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Angle of Repose. The house eventually became derelict. From the mid-1980s until April 2002, it was owned by Terra Alta Development. During this time Penelope Curtis founded the Julia Morgan Conservancy which began restoration plans for the house. By November 2002, Sandy Sanderson, an Oregon developer, obtained a binding contract on the property. Restoration was begun by the North Star Historic Conservancy after the Nevada County Land Trust hired Bruce Conklin to oversee the site's restoration in 2003. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 1, 2011, it is still undergoing restoration. Architecture and fittings The mansion, with 22 rooms, is an early example of the California Arts and Crafts style. The style, dubbed the First Bay Tradition, included natural materials and site-sensitive design such as local waste rock from the mine, hand-peeled logs and redwood shingles. Exemplifying Morgan's style, the house features exposed beams, strong horizontal lines, the use of shingles, and earth-toned colors. The building is oriented west and u-shaped in plan. An entry courtyard is situated on the east side, while a sprawling stone terrace is on the west side. Framed in wood, the walls are of stone masonry at the first level, and redwood shingle sheathing at the second level. The low pitch gable roof features wide overhangs and eyebrow vents, the original wood shingle replaced in 2004 with fireproof composite shingles. The foundation is of quarry stone and cement, while the chimneys are of brick. There are several entry doors which access the living room, library, study, and dining room. Original features, such as doorknobs and light fixtures, are no longer on the property. On the second level, an open air sleeping porch is situated above the terrace. A courtyard is situated between the building's two wings. A small garage, which was added at the northeast corner of the building ca. 1968, is being removed. Grounds The grounds feature a Great Lawn and other distinct areas for community events. There are giant ponderosa pines, sloping lawns, and plantings that date to the late 1800s. The hybridized fruit trees that resulted from Foote's collaboration with Luther Burbank are evidenced in the surrounding heritage orchard. Historically, the property included hydrangeas, magnolias, and crepe myrtle. There was a fern grove to the south and landscaping to the north included Japanese quince, peonies, cedar, and tulip trees.

The performance is about the local folk hero Jamalo Khoso Baloch, of middle 19th century. In modern times, the song has been repopularized since 1947, and recorded by Abida Parveen, in Sindhi, and Shazia Khushk, in the Urdu language. Mostly this song and dance are performed at the end of a programme which interprets the battles and folk legends of Sindh. It is danced on the occasions of festivity and celebration. The main singer sings the verses praising Jamalo's bravery, and each verse is accompanied with shouts of \\"Ho Jamalo!\\" by the dancers, who go round the main singer, doing simple dance steps. The song picks up speed towards the end. Performances are said to be trance-inducing. History Jamalo Sheedi was born in Sukkur, then in the Bombay Presidency of British-occupied India under the company rule of the British East India Company, but today in the Sindh Province of present-day Pakistan. He was sentenced to execution by hanging, by British East India Company officer John Jacob in Sukkur, probably in 1889, the year Jacob briefly became Acting Commissioner of Sindh before being deployed to Persia later the same year. Jamalo (as he is conventionally called) was held in jail near the Sukkur Bridge, which had recently been built for trains by the English, but was untested. The government of Sindh announced that whoever test-drove a train across the bridge would be given a prize. Jamalo sent a letter to Jacob, offering to perform the train crossing, on the condition that he be released from jail and his sentence if he crossed safely. He did cross safely, was freed, and was given a prize by the East India Company's governor of Sindh. His wife composed the \\"Ho Jamalo\\" song about his exploit, and it has since become famous in the region.Encyclopedia of Baloch, Yasir Khan Baloch{{vs|date=June 2015|reason=No such source seems to exist, and I can't find anything in English about this folkloric/historical character at all.

Che≈Çmno land is named after the city of Che≈Çmno (historically also known as Culm). The largest city in the region is Toru≈Ñ; another bigger city is GrudziƒÖdz. It is located on the right bank of the Vistula river, from the mouth of the Drwƒôca (southern boundary) to the Osa (northern). Its eastern frontier is Lubawa Land. The region, depending on the period and interpretation, may be included in other larger regions: Mazovia, Pomerania or Prussia. Currently in Poland it is classified as part of Pomerania, due to strong connections with Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania in recent centuries, with which it is collectively called the Vistula Pomerania (Pomorze Nadwi≈õla≈Ñskie), although it also has close ties with neighboring Kuyavia. As a result it forms part of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodship, although a small part of the Che≈Çmno Land is located in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Initially it was the westernmost part of Mazovia within medieval Poland, especially after the fragmentation of Poland. According to German historiography, it is classified as part of Prussia, although it did not form part of pre-Christian Prussia and was not inhabited by the Old Prussians, but by Slavic Lechites,Wojciech Chudziak, Stan bada≈Ñ nad wczesnym ≈õredniowieczem ziemi che≈Çmi≈Ñskiej ‚Äì g≈Ç√≥wne tezy i perspektywy badawcze, Studia nad osadnictwem ≈õredniowiecznym ziemi che≈Çmi≈Ñskiej, tom 5, Toru≈Ñ 2003 who in the 10th century became part of the emerging Polish state. History Che≈Çmno, the historic capital of Che≈Çmno Land The first historical account of Che≈Çmno and Che≈Çmno Land dates back to 1065 when Boles≈Çaw II of Poland granted a tax privilege to an abbey in a nearby Mogilno. The document lists Che≈Çmno (\\"Culmine\\") along with other towns which then belonged to the province of Masovia. The area, being closest to the Polans, came to be populated by the Lechitic Kuyavians and tribes from Greater Poland. The Masovians were led by Masos, who left the Polish duke Boleslaw I and sought refuge with the Prussians. When this area was subdued by the rulers of the Polans Che≈Çmno became a local centre of castellany (kasztelania). Che≈Çmno Land was Christianised in the 11th century. According to the will of Duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, Che≈Çmno Land, after his death in 1138 became a part of the Duchy of Masovia governed by his son Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly and his descendants during the feudal fragmentation of Poland. By the 13th century the territory was subject to raids by pagan Old Prussians, who sacked Che≈Çmno, the province's main town, in 1216. In 1220 Conrad I of Masovia, with the participation of the other dukes of Poland, led a partial reconquest of the province, but the project of establishing a Polish defense of the province failed due to conflicts between the dukes. He brought the crusading Knights of Dobrzy≈Ñ to Masovia, where they built a castle at Dobrzy≈Ñ in 1224 as a base for attacks against the Prussians. As a result, the territory was again sacked and devastated by Prussian raids, which led to depopulation of the province. GrudziƒÖdz Granaries, one of the region's most famous landmarks Being involved in dynastic struggles elsewhere and too weak to deal with the Prussians alone, Conrad needed to safeguard and establish borders against the heathen Old Prussians, because his territory of Masovia was also in danger after the Prussians besieged P≈Çock. Conrad awarded the already devastated Che≈Çmno Land to the Teutonic Knights, giving them Nieszawa at first. He also brought in German settlers to P≈Çock. In 1226 Duke Conrad I of Masovia enlisted the aid of the Teutonic Order to protect Masovia and help convert the Prussians to Christianity. In return, the knights were to keep Che≈Çmno Land as a fief. The land constituted the base of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights, and its later conquest of Prussia. Banner of Land of Che≈Çmno in battle of Grunwald (1410) The Teutonic Order obtained an Imperial bull from Emperor Frederick II before entering Prussia. In 1243 the papal legate William of Modena divided Prussia into four dioceses under the archbishop of Riga, one of which was the Diocese of Culm (Che≈Çmno). Coat of arms of the former Che≈Çmno Voivodeship In 1440 the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation was founded, and among its founders were cities of the Che≈Çmno Land, including Toru≈Ñ, Che≈Çmno, GrudziƒÖdz and Brodnica. In 1454 the confederation started an uprising against the Teutonic Order and turned to Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon with a request to include the region to Poland. The king agreed and signed the incorporation act, after which the Thirteen Years' War broke out. It ended in a Polish victory and by the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ in 1466, the return of Che≈Çmno Land to the Polish Crown was confirmed. It administratively formed the Che≈Çmno Voivodeship, located in the Royal Prussia province, later also in the larger Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Its capital was Che≈Çmno, while the largest city was Toru≈Ñ, which as a royal city became one of the largest and wealthiest cities of Poland, and was the site of numerous significant events in the history of Poland. In 1997 the Medieval Town of Toru≈Ñ was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2007 Toru≈Ñ's historic center was added to the list of Seven Wonders of Poland. For hundreds of years, Toru≈Ñ has remained the largest city in the Che≈Çmno Land. In 1772 as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Che≈Çmno Land (with the exception of Toru≈Ñ, annexed in 1793) was seized by the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1807 and 1815 Che≈Çmno Land was a part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw and Toru≈Ñ was even the duchy's temporary capital in April and May of 1809. In 1815 it was annexed by Prussia again, first it became part of the Grand Duchy of Posen, but in 1817 was incorporated into the province of West Prussia. Following the Treaty of Versailles, Che≈Çmno Land was returned to Poland in January 1920, after the Poles regained independence in 1918. In the interwar period it formed the southern part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship with the capital in Toru≈Ñ. It was occupied after the Invasion of Poland in September 1939 by Nazi Germany and unilaterally annexed in October, however, lacking any international recognition. During the occupation, the Germans carried out the Intelligenzaktion, a planned mass murder of the local Polish elites. Already in autumn of 1939, about 23,000 Poles of the pre-war Pomeranian Voivodeship were murdered. In January 1945 it was captured by the Red Army and the German occupation of this part of Poland ended. Cities and towns The region is currently inhabited by around 650,000 people. There are 14 cities and towns in the region.

Teddy-Hermann is one of the oldest teddy bear producers in Germany. Its products are highly valued among collectors.\\"B√§ren Aus Pl√ºsch\\" Products The main products of Teddy-Hermann are teddy bears and other plush animals, including among others cats, dogs, monkeys, and birds. The company groups its products into three main lines: Hermann Teddy Original, Hermann Teddy Miniaturen, and Hermann Teddy Collection. The Hermann Teddy Original line is directed toward collectors and encompasses traditional and designer teddy bears as well as other animals, all of which are produced on premises in Hirschaid. The Hermann Teddy Miniaturen line encompasses teddy bears under 12 centimeters in length and is therefore unique among the offerings of other European teddy bear producers. Meanwhile, the Hermann Teddy Collection line is directed toward children and encompasses the widest range of plush animals. Since its founding, Teddy-Hermann has gradually altered the range, materials, and designs of its products. The company has greatly increased the variety of teddy bears, developing the Hermann Teddy Collection and Hermann Teddy Miniaturen lines in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, and has expanded the representation of animals among its offerings. While Teddy-Hermann continues to use mohair in its Hermann Teddy Original line, it has shifted to the use of synthetic and other fabrics in its Hermann Teddy Collection line. The company has also redesigned its teddy bears to give them a softer, more childlike appearance. History Founding BE-HA Quality Germany,Mullins, Teddy Bears Past and Present, p. 33. later renamed Teddy-Hermann, was founded in 1912 in Sonneberg, Germany,Pistorius, Tales of Teddy Hermann, p. 11. by Bernhard Hermann, who had previously spent several years working with his father Johann in the family business of crafting children's violins and later toys.Pistorius, Tales of Teddy Hermann, p. 8. The ‚ÄúBE-HA‚Äù part of the company name derived from the pronunciation of Bernhard Hermann's initials. During the first years of operation, the company produced its first plush toys. Early Years Bernhard Hermann's wife Ida managed BE-HA Quality Germany when the former was conscripted into the German army to fight in World War I. The loss of labor and expertise the company suffered as a result of Bernhard Hermann's absence was compounded by the shortage of materials during wartime. Though Bernhard Hermann survived the war and returned to run the company, BE-HA Quality Germany continued to face great adversity, now in the form of hyperinflation. While Bernhard Hermann's company did not go out of business as a result of economic hardship, many other toy producers in Sonneberg did. One reason for the persistence of BE-HA Quality Germany was its commitment to quality, as the craftsmanship of other companies‚Äô products sank during this period.Froese and Hentschel, Das gro√üe Teddy-Hermann-Buch, pp. 13‚àí14. During the 1920s, BE-HA Quality Germany primarily produced teddy bears and other plush toys such as dogs.Cockrill, The Teddy Bear Encyclopedia, p. 31. At the same time the company made stuffed dolls typical of the toy industry of Sonneberg, primarily so-called ‚Äúmama dolls,‚Äù which had porcelain heads. It was also during the 1920s that Bernhard Hermann developed close business relations with international toy retailers, including FAO Schwarz, Woolworth, Knickerbocker, and Galeries Lafayette. These contacts greatly profited BE-HA Quality Germany, making the 1920s the company's ‚Äúgolden years.‚ÄùFroese and Hentschel, Das gro√üe Teddy-Hermann-Buch, p. 17. The golden years at BE-HA Quality Germany came to a decisive end with the Great Depression and the start of World War II. The Great Depression was especially bad for the company because of the sharp decline in the purchasing of toys and other such goods. Bernhard Hermann overcame this in part by contracting with toy distributors in Switzerland, which had been less affected by the Great Depression than other Western countries, though sales continued to suffer. The rise of the Nazis and advent of World War II led to new restrictions on BE-HA Quality Germany's operations, though the company was able to increase its sales during the late 1930s, selling its products exclusively in foreign markets in accordance with new German law. In the 1930s, BE-HA Quality Germany began to alter the appearance of the bears, employing the so-called ‚ÄúSonneberger Schnitt‚Äù (‚ÄúSonneberg cut‚Äù), which involved the separation and reattaching of teddy bear snouts to allow mixing and matching of snout and body fabrics.Froese and Hentschel, Das gro√üe Teddy- Hermann-Buch, p. 20. The company also began to give its teddy bears a more childlike appearance, giving the toys larger eyes and placing them closer to center of the face. Move to Hirschaid After the Soviet occupation of eastern Germany, Bernhard Hermann selected Hirschaid in the American occupied zone as the new site of his company to avoid dispossession by the East German communist provisional government. In 1948 Bernhard Hermann sent his son Werner to Hirschaid to develop the company's presence at its new location. By 1953Cockrill, The Teddy Bear Encyclopedia, p. 225. the Hermann family had managed to flee to West Germany and completed the company's move, reconstituting it as the ‚ÄúTeddy Pl√ºschspielwarenfabrik Gebr. Hermann KG.‚Äù From the time after its relocation up until the end of the 1950s, Teddy-Hermann experienced enormous growth, owing in part to the so-called West German Wirtschaftswunder, and adopted the branding ‚ÄúHermann Teddy Original,‚Äù which was borne on the also newly introduced Teddy-seal brand. During this period the company produced as many as 500,000 plush toys a year and began introducing many new series of plush animals, including squirrels, dogs, rabbits, pandas, penguins, and horses. After Bernhard Hermann's death in 1959 and his sons Helmut, Arthur, and Werner's assumption of leadership, the company continued to grow and issue new series of toys throughout the 1960s. Throughout these two decades, the importance of Teddy-Hermann's domestic market overshadowed that of its international one. The company's growth was stemmed in the 1970s by inflation and competition with East Asian imports, which caused the prices of Teddy-Hermann's products to rise and in turn a decline in sales. In response to this decline, the company reduced its workforce and eliminated one of its production facilities. New Leadership In the 1980s and 1990s the company came under the leadership of Arthur and Werner Hermann's daughters, Margit Drolshagen, Marion Mehling, and Traudel Mischner,Pistorius, Tales of Teddy Hermann, p. 23. and began to develop its current three lines of plush toys. A growing market for collectors in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1980s led to the creation of the Gebr√ºder Hermann Fan Club. Collectors‚Äô interest in Teddy-Hermann products remained high throughout the 1990s in the United States, where at the peak of popularity there were over 250 Teddy-Hermann dealers.Froese and Hentschel, Das gro√üe Teddy-Hermann-Buch, p. 35 . In 1991 the company became a limited company, adopting the name ‚ÄúGebr. Hermann GmbH & Co. KG‚Äù;Pistorius, Tales of Teddy Hermann, p. 23. later, the company adopted the name ‚ÄúTeddy-Hermann GmbH.‚Äù Froese and Hentschel, Das gro√üe Teddy-Hermann-Buch, p. 43 . In order to keep prices low for the children's teddy bear market, Teddy-Hermann introduced in 1990 its Hermann Teddy 2000 line, later renamed Hermann Teddy Collection, whose products were manufactured in East Asia. In the mid-1990s the company introduced its Hermann Teddy Miniaturen line. In 2000 Teddy-Hermann introduced its Teddy-Hermann Collectors‚Äô Club.

The 2011 Stepping Hill Hospital poisoning incident refers to a series of deaths at the Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester, which began in July 2011. Background and investigation The investigation was sparked by a nurse on a ward at the hospital, who noticed that several patients on the ward had unexpectedly low blood sugar levels. An investigation suggested that a number of saline ampoules and saline drips had been contaminated with insulin, and this was believed to have lowered the blood sugar levels in the patients. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to allow the uptake of glucose in the blood to be used by the muscles and cells of the body for energy. The brain requires a constant supply of glucose in order to be able to function properly. As insulin lowers the level of glucose in the blood, if too much of it is present in the circulation this can quickly lead to lowered blood glucose levels, commonly known as low blood sugar (or hypoglycemia); which as a consequence negatively affects the functioning of the brain and central nervous system. This can be rapidly and irreversibly fatal if not recognised and treated early enough. At Stepping Hill it was suspected that, due to the increased levels of insulin in the patients' bloodstreams, they quickly became hypoglycemic and three confirmed fatalities occurred. A number of other patients are also believed by police to have been poisoned in this way, though most did not suffer fatal consequences. Two further deaths in the A1 and A3 wards were added to the investigation on 21 July. Three patients' deaths ‚Äì two elderly males, George Keep, 84 and Arnold Lancaster, 71, and a female ‚Äì Tracey Arden, 44 ‚Äì were attributed to the alleged contamination, however it was also reported that each of the patients also had underlying medical conditions that made them weaker. On 21 July 2011, it was confirmed that two more patients' deaths were being linked to the investigation, bringing the death count to five. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) announced that the inquiry into how saline solutions had been contaminated with insulin would form the basis of a murder inquiry. During the investigation, 60 detectives were involved in determining how and when the saline solutions were contaminated. Meanwhile, a number of armed police guards were stationed at the hospital, and staff were made to work in pairs when administering medication to patients. Rebecca Leighton On 20 July 2011, GMP confirmed that they had arrested a 27-year-old female nurse ‚Äì Rebecca Jane Leighton, who worked at the hospital on ward A1 and A3 ‚Äì in connection with the murder inquiry. The Nursing and Midwifery Council opened a fitness to practice investigation after the arrest of Leighton. On 22 July, Leighton appeared at Manchester City Magistrates' court. She was charged with three counts of criminal damage with intent to endanger life, three counts of criminal damage being reckless as to whether life was being endangered, and one charge of theft. She was remanded in custody to next appear at Manchester Crown Court on 1 August. Charges against Leighton were dropped on 2 September 2011. The Crown Prosecution Service said it was \\"no longer appropriate\\" to continue the case against her. Evidence that was expected to appear in support of the charges had not become available. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, said Leighton had been charged on the basis there was \\"reasonable suspicion she had committed the offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the continuing investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable amount of time\\". She subsequently hired celebrity publicist Max Clifford to help clear her name. On 2 December 2011, it was reported that Leighton had been dismissed from her job as a nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital. She had been suspended ever since the allegations were first made nearly five months earlier. An appeal hearing, presided over by Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, against her termination was held on Thursday 2 February 2012 but the appeal was dismissed. The Trust said it was unable to comment because of confidentiality issues and there was no response from Leighton's lawyers. It was also revealed on that day that police were now investigating a total of 19 deaths at the hospital as possible victims of saline poisoning. Victorino Chua On 5 January 2012, it was revealed that a death that had taken place on 31 December 2011 ‚Äì i.e. after Leighton had been dismissed ‚Äì was now being linked to the investigation. 46-year-old Victorino Chua, a nurse at the hospital, had been arrested amid claims that forms had been altered and a patient given extra medication. He was later also questioned on the earlier deaths. He was not charged with any offence and was placed on police bail. By July 2012, the Greater Manchester Police stated that they were making good progress in the investigation, that twenty-two people had been poisoned and that seven deaths had occurred. On 29 March 2014, Victorino Chua was charged with the murders of Tracey Arden, Arnold Lancaster and Alfred Derek Weaver, and 31 other offences including GBH and attempted poisoning. He was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later. The prosecution argued that Chua had decided to take out his personal frustrations on patients \\"for reasons truly known only to himself\\". On 18 May 2015, Chua was convicted on two counts of murder. He was found not guilty of murdering Arnold Lancaster, who had been suffering from terminal cancer, but was convicted of attempting to cause him and twenty other patients grievous bodily harm with intent by poisoning. He was also found guilty of eight offences of unlawfully administering or causing to be taken by another person any poison or destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy, or attempting to do so, after deliberately altering prescriptions. The jury at Manchester Crown Court had deliberated for eleven days. Chua received 25 life sentences and was told that he would spend a minimum of 35 years in jail before he would be eligible for parole.

He is known for the art he made of Mao Zhedong, the then-leader of China. Biography Yu Huiyong was born in Shandong Province in 1925. He was greatly interested in music and learned to play a variety of instruments such as the erhu, the sanxian, and the dizi. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he joined a communist performance group, and in 1949 went to teach at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (while simultaneously studying popular music), helping at turning a Western-oriented institution into a training ground for the communist art of People's China. In the meantime, he joined the Communist Party of China. He graduated in 1950 but continued to work in the field of music. In the same year, Yu Huiyong was transferred to the Research Institute on Ethnic Music, where he wrote many essays on music styles in China's provinces and took part in creating orchestral performances. In later years, he continued teaching and writing, publishing a comprehensive essay on China's folk music in 1959. In 1962 he was promoted to lecturer at the Shanghai Conservatory, and deputy director of its musical theory department the following year. In 1965 he was appointed member of the Drama Reform and Creative Group, and worked on musical embellishment of Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy, one of the \\"eight model revolutionary theatrical works\\" re-elaborated by Jiang Qing. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution broke out, Yu Huiyong and many of the Shanghai Conservatory staff were targeted as bourgeois intellectuals and forced to resign, submit to self-criticism and criticism by students, and do physical labor. Yu Huiyong however took active part at the movement: he was called to Beijing to stage the \\"eight model revolutionary theatrical works\\", then returned to Shanghai where he joined the \\"rebel faction\\". In 1967 he was appointed vice-chairman of the Shanghai Conservatory Revolutionary Committee, chairman of the preparatory committee for the Shanghai Cultural Revolutionary Committee, and put in charge of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre. He worked directly under Zhang Chunqiao, one of the Gang of Four. Taking an ever more prominent role, in 1968 Yu Huiyong chaired the criticism meeting against He Luting, president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 1969 he participated to the CPC 9th National Congress and was appointed standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. In 1970 Yu Huiyong was transferred to Beijing to become a member of the Cultural Group Under the State Council of the People's Republic of China chaired by Wu De. He was in charge of following movie transposition of model operas like The Legend of the Red Lantern, Red Detachment of Women, etc. In 1973 he was elected member of the CPC Central Committee by the Party's 10th Congress, and also appointed deputy head of the Cultural Group; later he was promoted to Minister of Culture in 1975 as the post was re-established by the 1st Session of the 4th National People's Congress. In the last stages of the Cultura Revolution, Yu Huiyong oversaw art production and anti-revisionist works in China, as the film Chunmiao (Spring Sprout), which was criticized by Deng Xiaoping as \\"ultra-leftist\\". All of this led him to be accused of being part of the Gang of Four plot, aspiring to be a vice-premier and CPC Politburo member. For that he was arrested in October 1976. He committed suicide in August 1977. |- Category:1925 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Politicians from Weihai Category:People of the Cultural Revolution Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Shandong Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Shandong Category:Chinese revolutionaries Category:Anti-revisionists Category:Chinese politicians who committed suicide Category:Ministers of Culture of the People's Republic of China Category:Suicides in the People's Republic of China Category:Republic of China musicians Category:People's Republic of China musicians Category:Musicians from Shandong Category:Republic of China essayists Category:People's Republic of China essayists Category:Writers from Weihai Category:Expelled members of the Chinese Communist Party Category:20th-century essayists ","title":"Yu Huiyong"},{"id":"32474118","text":"Dhekelia Power Station is one of three power plants belonging to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus. It is located approximately east of the city of Larnaca and it has a capacity of 460 MW. History The original plant was the first of the company which started building it in the mid-1950s. Completed, it consisted of seven steam turbogenerators with a total capacity of 84 MW. As the machinery grew old and demand rose steadily, a new plant was built next to the old. Built in five phases, the current power plant consists of six steam turbines, each of a capacity of 60 MW and six diesel engines of approximately 17 MW each. All boilers burn heavy fuel oil and were built by Waagner Bir√≥. The first two turbines and generators were supplied by Siemens and came online in 1982 and 1983. Turbines 3 and 4 were made by Toshiba and the corresponding generators by Alstom and came online in 1986. The steam plant was completed with the supply of turbogenerators 5 and 6 from Bharat Heavy Electricals in 1992 and 1993. The six diesel engines run on either heavy fuel oil or diesel oil with the first three being two-stroke MAN ones erected by Mitsui in 2009 and the other three being four-stroke ones manufactured by W√§rtsil√§ in 2010.

Design and development The Sagitta was designed by Alsema between 1957-61 specifically for the then-new FAI Standard Class. Like other early standard class gliders it was quickly surpassed in performance by newer fibreglass aircraft. The Sagitta has a wooden structure. The fuselage is covered with plywood, the wings and tail surfaces with plywood and doped aircraft fabric covering. The span wing features top and bottom air brakes and employs NACA 63-618 airfoil at the wing root, and a NACA 4412 section at the wing tip. The controls are automatically connected on assembly. The bubble canopy slides aft for cockpit access and can be locked open in several positions in flight. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel. In the Netherlands the aircraft was certified for cloud flying and aerobatics, but its US certification does not include these authorizations. The type received its US type certificate on 2 August 1965. Twenty Sagittas were built.

Nydalens Compagnie was a company in Nydalen, Oslo, Norway. It was founded in 1845 as a textile manufacturer, and from 1963 to 1998 it was a real estate company. History It was founded in 1845 by Adam Hiorth, Ole Gjerdrum, Hans Gulbranson and Oluf N. Roll as Nydalens Bomuldsspinderi. The name was changed in 1867, when it also became a limited company. It was listed on Oslo Stock Exchange in 1942. The year 1845 has been called the starting point of early industrialization in Norway. This is because of the founding of Nydalens Compagnie, and in addition the factory V√∏iens Bomuldsspinderi was being built. The textile manufacturing at Nydalens Compagnie began in 1847, and between the 1890s and the 1940s Nydalens Compagnie was the largest textile company in the country with about 1100 employees. The production workers were mainly women and children, with a few men as supervisors and maintenance workers. The company adopted a system of industrial paternalism, offering houses for the employees and social institutions, including a primary school for children. The children typically started working at the factory at the age of nine, normally spending half the day at work and the other half at school. Factory manager Otto Gjerdrum founded a youth club and a ski club, and organized Christmas Balls at the school. Textile production ceased in 1963, whereupon Nydalens Compagnie continued as a real estate company. In 1992 it incorporated Bergen-based Investa Eiendom, and had headquarters in Bergen for one year. It was sold to Anders Wilhelmsen & Co in 1993 and moved back to Oslo. It was incorporated into another real estate company owned by Anders Wilhelmsen & Co, Linstow, in 1998. The former textile production facilities, \\"Nydalen Park\\", had already in 1996 been sold to the estate Avantor.

It is a demersal fish that lives on soft, sandy bottoms at depths of up to , though it is most commonly found at depths of around . Its native habitat is the temperate waters of the northern Pacific, from Korea and the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea and Barkley Sound on the west coast of Canada. Males grow up to in length, though the common length is around . The maximum recorded weight is , and the maximum recorded lifespan is 26 years. Description left The yellowfin sole has a deep body, with a small mouth, moderately large and closely situated eyes, and a slightly pronounced snout. The upper side of the body is olive to brown in colour, with dark mottling, and dorsal and anal fins are yellowish on both sides of the body, with faint dark bars and a narrow dark line at the base. Scales are rough on both sides of the body. Taxonomy The yellowfin sole was originally described as Pleuronectes asper by Pallas in 1814, and subsequently as Limanda asprella by Hubbs in 1915. Role in ecosystem The yellowfin sole occupies a moderately high trophic level in the food chain. The diet of the yellowfin sole consists mainly of zoobenthic organisms, including polychaetes and amphipods such as hydroids, worms, mollusks, and brittle stars. Yellowfin sole are known to be prey fish for sculpin, Pacific halibut, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder. Reproduction Female yellowfin sole reach reproductive maturity when they reach around in length (usually around 10.5 years old), and spawn following migration to shallow waters during spring and summer. Yellowfin sole have high reproductive potential, with females producing 1-3 million eggs. Commercial fishing Yellowfin sole is fished commercially, primarily by demersal trawl fishing. Having recovered from high fishing rates in the 1960s and 1970s, it is currently not considered to be overfished, and the biomass of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea is estimated to be high and stable, above its target level.

Education Ivlev graduated in law from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1993 and later continued his legal studies at Columbia University Summer Law School in Amsterdam and at Queen Mary, University of London. Career Russia In 1997 Ivlev became a partner in a Moscow-based international law firm, ALM Feldmans, which was effectively destroyed by the broader attack on Yukos and its advisers in 2005. A district court in Moscow issued an arrest warrant for Ivlev in 2005 on charges of embezzlement, money laundering and tax evasion, identical to those against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, who were charged with the same in 2007. Ivlev had refused to give (false) incriminating evidence against his clients. On 15 February 2005 the Moscow City Court overruled the Basmanny District Court in favour of Ivlev, but that same court upheld a Basmanny District Court arrest warrant in December 2005. Having witnessed the conduct of the case against Yukos so far, Ivlev remained in New York for his own safety.

The regiment was raised in 1943, by the expansion of an existing airborne artillery battery. Attached to the 1st Airborne Division in 1943, the regiment landed in Italy as part of Operation Slapstick‚Äîpart of the Allied invasion of Italy‚Äîand then, when the division was withdrawn, it stayed behind to support other divisions of the British Eighth Army in the Italian Campaign until the end of the year. In 1944 the regiment rejoined the 1st Airborne Division in England and, in September 1944, took part in Operation Market Garden, which was the airborne assault in the Netherlands. During the battle of Arnhem that followed the regiment was one of the divisional units that formed a defensive ring around Oosterbeek. Reformed after Arnhem, the regiment never fought in another battle. They did, however, take part in Operation Doomsday, the repatriation of the German occupation army in Norway in May 1945. After this the regiment returned to England and was disbanded in December 1945. Formation Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 In September 1941 the 1st Parachute Brigade began forming, comprising three parachute infantry battalions. In keeping with British Army practice at the same time as the brigade's infantry battalions were forming, airborne supporting arms were formed including men from the Royal Artillery.Ferguson, p.6 The origins of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment can be traced to the formation of the 458th Independent Light Battery, Royal Artillery in February 1941. At the time, the battery was commanded by Major Pat Lloyd and, equipped with the First World War vintage 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer, served on the North-West Frontier in India. The 3.7 inch Howitzer could fire a shell and weighed .Hogg, p.91 In 1941, the British airborne forces were being raised and needed an artillery formation, so the battery was renamed the 1st Airlanding Light Battery and it was converted into an airborne unit. Assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, the battery moved to the airborne forces depot at Bulford Garrison in April 1942. Airborne artillery Gun Position Officer, Italy 1943 The battery spent the next eleven months training for their new role. In February 1943, however, it was expanded to a full regiment commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. McLeod. The regiment now consisted of three batteries, each of two troops, with four guns per troop, or twenty-four guns in the regiment. At the same time their 3.7 inch Howitzers were replaced by the newer American 75 mm Pack Howitzer. The 75 mm Howitzer could be broken down into six components. It fired a shell a maximum of and weighed .Kinard, p.274 Being the only field artillery unit in the division, one battery of eight guns could be expected to support each of the division's three brigades.Journal of the Royal Artillery (1963), p.132 At this time the only way airborne forces could transport artillery guns and their towing vehicles by air was by using gliders. In the regiment's case this was normally the Airspeed Horsa, piloted by two men from the Glider Pilot Regiment.Tugwell, p.39 With a wingspan of and a length of , the Horsa had a maximum load capacity of ‚Äîspace for two pilots, a maximum of twenty-eight troops or two jeeps, one jeep, an artillery gun and a half ton trailer or one jeep with up to two trailers.Fowler, p.9 One disadvantage of being transported by the Horsa glider, was that only three artillerymen and the two pilots could be carried with the gun.Peters and Buist, p.65 Operations Italy British 5th Infantry Division, November 1943. The regiment left England for North Africa on 16 May 1943, arriving at Oran in Algeria on 26 May. The 1st Airborne Division as a whole did not take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily. However, the 1st Parachute and 1st Airlanding brigades took part in brigade sized operations, Ladbroke and Fustian, without any artillery support from the regiment. While in Sicily Lieutenant-Colonel Crawfurd, the Division's Commander Royal Artillery (DCRA), was killed. He was replaced by Lieutenant- Colonel McLeod and the second in command, Major W. F. K \\"Sheriff\\" Thompson, was given command of the regiment. In September 1943, they were involved in Operation Slapstick, part of the Allied invasion of Italy. The division in North Africa boarded the ships of the Royal Navy's 12th Cruiser Squadron at Bizerta on 8 September 1943.Chant, p.254Cole, p.52 At 15:00 on 9 September, the flotilla reached the port of Taranto on the heel of Italy. The landings were unopposed and the troops were soon disembarked.Blumenson, p.114 In Italy the regiment not only supported the 1st Airborne Division, but also fired in support of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division at Campobasso. The 1st Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England, leaving the regiment behind. In October they supported the British 5th Infantry Division at Rionero and then Isernia in November. After this, they supported the 2nd New Zealand Division during three unsuccessful attacks on Orsogna. Next they fired in support of the independent 2nd Parachute Brigade and the British 78th Infantry Division from mid-December 1943 to January 1944, at Casoli, Gessopalena and Roccascalegna. The regiment was then withdrawn and sent to rejoin the 1st Airborne Division in Boston, England. England In England the regiment trained for operations in North-West Europe under the supervision of I Airborne Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Frederick Arthur Montague Browning. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, Operation Wastage was a contingency plan drawn up whereby all of the 1st Airborne Division would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if delays were experienced.Peters and Buist, p.10 In early September the regiment prepared for Operation Comet during which the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades were to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem.Peters and Buist, p.28 Planning for Comet was well advanced when, on 10 September, the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation was proposed with the same objectives as Comet but to be carried out by three divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army.Peters and Buist, pp.40‚Äì41 Arnhem Landings by the First Allied Airborne Army's three divisions began in the Netherlands on 17 September 1944. Although the allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, under Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General James M. Gavin, at Grave required two lifts while the British 1st Airborne Division, under Major-General Roy Urquhart, at Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three-quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its capacity for infantry and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.Tugwell, p.241 Map of the Arnhem area showing the planned drop and landing zones. The 1st Airborne Division had the required airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider-borne anti-tank weapons or two of the parachute brigades and the airlanding brigade on day one. Instead however, the vast majority of the division's vehicles and heavy equipment, plus the 1st Parachute Brigade, most of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops were to be on the first lift, with the rest to follow over the next two days. Following the first lift, the airlanding brigade would remain at the landing grounds to defend them for the following day's lifts, while the parachute brigade set out alone to capture the bridges and ferry crossing on the River Rhine.Urquhart, pp.5‚Äì10 On 17 September 1944, the first day of the operation, fifty-seven gliders carried the regimental headquarters and the 1st and 3rd batteries to Arnhem.Peters and Buist, pp.326‚Äì327 The 2nd Battery and the remaining men of the regimental headquarters were on the second day's lift.Peters and Buist, pp.328‚Äì331 With only three of the regiment's men travelling in the gliders, the two pilots stayed with the guns as drivers and to provide local protection, until the rest of the regiment assembled.Peters and Buist, p.96 Immediately after landing the 3rd Battery set up their gun line to the east of landing zone 'Z'.Peters and Buist, p.99 Meanwhile, the 1st Battery set up between the 3rd and the village of Wolfheze. Both were on call to support the 1st Parachute Brigade in their advance to the bridges, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade defending the landing zones.Peters and Buist, p.101 In the morning of the second day, 19 September, in order to support the paratroopers in Arnhem, the guns had to move to a new position beside the church in Oosterbeek. The batteries were set up on the slight high ground that existed to the north-east and north-west of the church.Urquhart, p.121 At the Arnhem road bridge, the 2nd Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and some supporting units, were under attack by the reconnaissance battalion of the 9th SS Panzer Division, which was attempting to force a crossing. The regiment's guns were called into action and caused significant damage to the un-armoured vehicles, armoured cars and half-tracks.Urquhart, p.99 Later they targeted German mortars firing at the 1st Parachute Battalion trying to fight through to the bridge in Arnhem.Peters, p.131 Their guns were also called upon to break up German attacks on the landing zones, still defended by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, which were in danger of being overrun.Peters and Buist, p.127 When the thirty- three gliders of the 2nd Battery that were on the second lift, arrived from around 15:00, one of their guns was damaged on landing and had to be left behind.Peters and Buist, p.141 By that afternoon, the attempt to fight through to the 2nd Parachute Battalion at the Arnhem bridge had failed and the remnants of four battalions involved started arriving at the regiment's position.Peters and Buist, p.189 75 mm gun and crew at Oosterbeek, 20 September 1944. On 20 September the division had been forced into a perimeter around Oosterbeek. The regiment was provided with local protection by five flights of the Glider Pilot Regiment. A group made up from the remnants of the 1st Parachute Brigade known as Lonsdale Force was to their right. While on the left was 'D' Company, 1st Battalion, Border Regiment.Peters and Buist, p.204 All that morning the Germans using tanks, self propelled artillery and infantry attempted to break through the British line and reach the regiment's guns from the east.Peters and Buist, p.208 On 21 September, the fifth day of the operation, the Germans again attacked from the east and got within of the guns. Engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, infantry support was requested and the guns were firing at point blank range.Urquhart, p.170 German artillery attacked the gun line killing and wounding a number of men.Peters and Buist, p.222 Amongst the wounded was the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson.Urquhart, p.125 One of the men defending the guns was Major Robert Cain who was part of Lonsdale force. Cain was wounded disabling a Tiger tank, after which he brought one of the regiment's guns forward to finish it off. Cain was later awarded the Victoria Cross, for this and other actions during the battle. By the end of the days fighting the regiment's stock of ammunition was running out.Peters and Buist, p.232 By 22 September, XXX Corps had advanced close enough to Arnhem for their artillery to participate in the battle.Peters and Buist, p.234 But it was the 1st Airlanding Regiment's guns that broke up a German attack on the glider pilots positions just after 07:00 that morning.Peters and Buist, pp.250‚Äì251 The following days took on the same pattern until the night of 25/26 September, when the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division were withdrawn south of the River Rhine. The gunners fired their remaining ammunition and then disabled the guns, so they could not be used by the Germans.Urquhart, pp.177‚Äì178 Of the regiment's 372 men who went to Arnhem, 136 were evacuated, 200 were reported missing and thirty-eight were killed. Norway After Arnhem the regiment and division was brought back up to strength, but the war ended before they were ready for further operations. Then in May 1945, the 1st Airborne Division was sent to Norway to disarm and repatriate the German occupation army. Code named Operation Doomsday for their part the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment were sent to Stavanger. In June some men left to join the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, part of the 6th Airborne Division. The rest of the regiment returned to England in August and was disbanded on 1 December 1945.
