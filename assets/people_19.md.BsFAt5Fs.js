The monument‚Äîintended to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Caja Madrid‚Äî was donated by the saving bank to the city of Madrid.  History  The obelisk under construction (May 15th 2009). To mark the 300th anniversary of its foundation (1702-2002), Caja Madrid commissioned the architect and sculptor Santiago Calatrava to design a monument that would be donated to the Villa de Madrid. It was conceived as a monument able to describe a helicoidal movement, yet the hefty maintenance costs led to the Ayuntamiento de Madrid's preference for keeping it \\"static\\". According to the initial project, the work would measure 120 meters tall. However, the complex network of tunnels that pass underneath the Plaza de Castilla made this original project unworkable, because of its weight. A decision was therefore made to lower the height to 92 metres. In early October 2007, the Caja contracted construction company Acciona to carry out the project, and in July of the following year building work began, having dismantled the fountain which existed previously at the selected spot. The obelisk was unveiled on 23 December 2009 by Juan Carlos I.  Description  Caja Madrid decided to call the Obelisk construction of the Fund, although given the way pyramid of such a monument, not an obelisk itself. In fact, its design is inspired by the Column of Infinity, a work of 29.33 meters in height by Romanian sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, built in 1938 in T√¢rgu Jiu (Oltenia, Romania). Calatrava described his work as \\"a mobile obelisk participating in the masculinity of the vertical [direction] and the delicacy and femininity of movement.\\" The inner core of the work, 92 meters high, is a cylindrical metal shaft of equal length and 2 meters in diameter, which rests on three metal legs. These, which weigh 50 tons each, are based in turn on three concrete piles 80 inches in diameter and 26 meters long. Instead of supporting the mast directly above its long axis, it was decided to do it this way to not make extreme demands on pre-existing tunnel at the site. By fixing shaft through joints, 462 ribs and 462 bronze strips 7.70 meters in length, lining the entire obelisk. These strips have a tilting movement transmitted through the ribs, giving the appearance of an outwardly moving wave of ascension along the spine.

History There is evidence that the village of Buzice dates back to 1384. Boyars, members of higher Slav nobility, inhabited Buzice, the eldest was Predota (c.1384‚Äì1412). His brother, Pesik (first recorded in 1397) had a son named Busk (or Bohuslav) (c.1401‚Äì1412), then a popular name within the nobility. Omeljan Pritsak concluded in research about the Attila Clan of the Hunnic Empire that the religious suffix ‚Äòsig‚Äô when combined with Hunnic ‚ÄòBuz‚Äô would mean ‚ÄúWild Boar like-man‚Äù, a symbol in the family emblem. In addition she thinks that the movement of the Slavs in Europe is accompanied under the leadership of the ruling class of Huns, whose language is gradually melted into Slavonic. Es latest members were recalled: Jan (c.1446-1480), Vaclav of Buzice, recalls Busek (c.1451-1473) and the younger Busek (c.1463-1498). By the end of the 15th century, the enlarged family could no longer feed the estate and moved to Blatne. The fortress of Buzice was bought by his cousin Zdenek Lev of Rozmital.  The Castle Located on a small hill, some one kilometre southwest of Buzice, the fortress has further decayed and used as a warehouse by fishermen. From the oldest part of the three storey rectangular building only remnants of the tower with the east wall of the body of the palace remain. Two one storey wings to the north and west were added through the 16th and 17th centuries and used as granaries. The courtyard is bounded by walls to the north and west. The original mound to the east and ditch to the south are preserved.  Bibliography  * The Bohemian Lord Leo's Knights of Rozmital, court, and pilgrims travel through the kingdoms of West, 1465-1467.

In 2009, Tin Alley's release \\"Out Of Control\\" reached number 1 on the Australian Music Office charts and was at number 1 on the Australian Independent Record Labels Association charts for five consecutive weeks. In November 2009, \\"Out Of Control\\" reached no.7 on the ARIA Australian singles charts and was in the ARIA Charts top 20 for six consecutive weeks. In early 2010, Tin Alley had a special dance version of \\"Out Of Control\\" mixed by Luke Chable. In February 2010, the Luke Chable Vs Tin Alley \\"Out Of Control\\" dance mix was used on many shows and radio playlisted programs Australia wide. In August 2010, \\"Out Of Control\\" was featured and marketed internationally by the fashion company Billabong as part of the 2010 Designers Closet Series. In mid August 2010, Tin Alley released Monster (Pop), a special pop edit taken from the group's original rock version mixed by David Treahearn and Rob Haggett in the UK. Soon after its release, lead singer and guitarist Jim Siourthas left the band for personal reasons. In July 2011, Stefan Waltersson briefly joined the group and in September Tin Alley released \\"Ride The Wave\\", written by Jim Siourthas, Peter Hofbauer & Paul Siourthas, which was voted by the music network as a top ten release (a song recorded the previous year) in Queensland. \\"Ride The Wave\\" and \\"Bounce Back\\" were later played nationally on commercial play-listed programs. During the \\"Bounce Back\\" release in September 2011, Paul Siourthas signed an endorsement with Australian guitar manufacture Maton. March 2013 saw Andrew Carter join the group to finalise the line up as lead vocalist which then saw the addition of guitarist Kieran Murphy, a member of Carter's previous band. In December 2013 Tin Alley returned to the studio where they recorded The Ghost EP in Queensland.

In 1998 drummer Peter Hofbauer of Austrian descent read an ad in The Sunday Herald and after two auditions joined the band Everything. In 2006, after producing some demo recordings at Melbourne records, Paul invited numerous labels and profile managers to various shows and showcases. In the process, Jim helped facilitate their progression in musical style from Indie rock to the more hard rock approach that is now their trademark. On the strength of these demos, Mark Huxley took the band to meet with executives at MGM Distribution where they were immediately signed to a distribution deal.  2007  Tin Alley's debut album, entitled Everyturn, was released in Australia on 17 October 2007, released along with its lead single, \\"In Your Hands\\". It peaked at number 13 and 17 consecutively in the AIR Charts. Due to the success of Tin Alley's first independent release, another single from the album was released through MGM titled \\"Polar Bear\\". The video clip for Polar Bear was filmed and directed in the United States of America by producer Max Rubitzky and proved to be an underground university hit in the United States. The track Polar Bear was only a digital release through MGM, unlike \\"In Your Hands\\" which was marketed to Australian record stores. In mid-2007, Tin Alley was voted in as 3RRR album of the week and soon found themselves playing on numerous TV shows such as The Breakfast Show and doing guest appearances and acoustic performances on various radio stations. In December 2007 Tin Alley were struck down with the near loss of Drummer Peter Hofbauer from a serious motorbike accident stopping the band in the midst of their first Australian tour.  2008  Tin Alley live at the FUSE Festival in South Australia, 2008. In late 2008, Tin Alley were back and began work on their second release Crossing Paths. The EP was written and recorded in Queensland and produced by Stuart Stuart who has also worked with The Veronicas and Small Mercies and many other Australian artists.  2009  In October 2009, the title track Out of Control was released to national radio as the lead single from the 2010 EP release Crossing Paths. The track Out Of Control was written by Tin Alley and had spawned from drummer Hofbauer's near death experience at the age of 27. The number 27 had led Tin Alley to delve deep into the history of the 27 Club that further led them basing the lyrics in general on that theme and even quoting Kurt Cobain's last words in his suicide note \\"Best to burn out bright than fade into the night\\" in the final seconds of the track. In early November 2009 Tin Alley made the top 100 on the ARIA Charts and in the weeks to follow Out Of Control also made No.1 spots on AIR Charts and AMO \\"Australian Music Office\\" Charts for six consecutive weeks and later peaked at number 7 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart in early December. The track \\"Out Of Control\\" also featured as mover of the month on the J√§germeister AIR Charts and was the fourth most added track to National radio and a week later got inducted into the 27 club hall of fame. Unplugged Session Tour 2009 / 2010 During the bands Out Of Control release Tin Alley were busy on their National Unplugged Sessions Tour. The Media Acoustic Tour kick started in Queensland that spanned across Australia over a four-month period from November 2009 to March 2010. While the band were in Sydney Jim mentioned on the Ugly Phil show on Triple M: In December Tin Alley came back to Melbourne to play a special showcase performance supporting Boom Crash Opera for their Christmas party in Melbourne along with other guests on the night such as Taxiride.  2010  Tin Alley were invited to assist Juke Kartel on their Return To Australia Tour with other special guests Electric Mary. The group's success to date from the Out Of Control release had created landmark achievements and new opportunity's for the band. Following the success of Out Of Control in late December 2009 Tin Alley received notice that Luke Chable was offering to create a special dance version of the band's rock track. In the weeks to follow Tin Alley accepted and the track was later received and backed by commercial and community radio stations in Australia and also received spins on commercial stations in the UK and United States and received a Top Ten review in The Music Network. Lead singer Jim Siourthas later went on to mention in an interview on Nova 969 he was not to happy at first listen with Luke's vocal effects on his voice however he was still very pleased to have Luke collaborate with Tin Alley and liked the dance version. Tin Alley were fortunate enough to showcase on the Friday night at the Melbourne Moomba Festival before bad weather and storms hit the Melbourne districts the following days resulting in headlining act Vanessa Amorosi and other performances being canceled on the Saturday and Sunday.  Band name  Tin Alley's original logo. The name Tin Alley was taken from the name of a laneway at Melbourne University where the brothers studied and regarding how they chose their name, Jim Siourthas states: \\"The name is something we thought about for a long time, and we wanted it to be something that we can relate to and the name Tin Alley was always on the books but Everything seemed to be more punchy at the time,\\" Jim has said. Musical style and influences Compared with the other hard rock bands of the late 1990s, Tin Alley's style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s. Tin Alley has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, The Doors, and Ramones. Tin Alley's success to date has been attributed to its sound, which fuses \\"the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses\\". By early 2006 the band began to incorporate more funk influences into its music. The band's 2007 album Everyturn was a deliberate break from the musical style of Tin Alley's earlier sound. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism which was somewhat of a return to the straight forward rock approach of the band's early work in Everything, when the band dabbled with experimental art rock and folk rock elements on 2001's \\"NYC\\". Some of the band's tracks on the 2007 album Everyturn was cited as a return to the band's early sound. The band's upcoming album, Crossing Paths, contains elements of pop and new wave. Tin Alley's lyrical topics range from personal to social and political concerns (\\"Looking Up\\", \\"Get By\\" and \\"In Your Hands\\"). The band's lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. The dynamic began to change when Paul went from guitar to bass and during the Everything era. Siourthas said in 2007, \\"Even though there is now only one guitar, I think there's maybe more room now, Peter will pull back and play a solid beat and Jim will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.\\"  See also  * Music of Australia  Sources  * Rave Magazine.

The island has an area of and a population of 41,822. Alabat Island comprises 3 municipalities, Perez in the northern tip, Alabat town proper in the center and Quezon in the south. The first inhabitants of the island were the indigenous Inagta Alabat people who are Negritos, the earliest settlers in the Philippines. The indigenous people spoke the Inagta Alabat language, one of the most endangered languages in the world. The island is located in the Lamon Bay and (33 km long) has an extensive mangrove fringe along its southwest shore, with several hundred hectares of intertidal mudflats exposed at low tide. Large portions of the original mangrove forest have been degraded or completely destroyed for the construction of fish and shrimp ponds. Alabat enjoys a humid tropical climate with no dry season, but a very pronounced period of maximum rainfall from November to January. The island is home to the indigenous Alabat Agta people, whose language is critically endangered. Inagta Alabat language In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the Alabat Island Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 30 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as Critically Endangered, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 30 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Alabat Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades. The Alabat Agta people live only on the island of Alabat in Quezon province and a small area is Guinayangan in mainland Luzon. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

Cotzias was born in Chania on the island of Crete, Greece on 16 June 1918. He was son of the two-times (1934 and 1951) mayor of Athens, Costas Cotzias. He started his medical studies at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, but fled to USA with his father when German troops invaded Athens (1941). He was accepted at Harvard Medical School and two years later he graduated cum laude. He then trained as an intern in pathology at Brigham Hospital, as an intern in medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, and was a resident in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital. He then worked in the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and in the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1957 Swedish scientist Arvid Carlsson demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain and not just a precursor for norepinephrine, as had been previously believed. He developed a method for measuring the amount of dopamine in brain tissues and found that dopamine levels in the basal ganglia, a brain area important for movement, were particularly high. He then showed that giving animals the drug reserpine caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control. These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Arvid Carlsson subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 along with co-recipients Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard. Subsequently, other physicians treated human Parkinson's patients with L-Dopa (the metabolic precursor for dopamine) and found it to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's. Unlike dopamine, L-Dopa passes the blood brain barrier. This produced transient benefit after injection of L-dopa. However, because of the severe toxicity associated with the injection, L-Dopa was not of practical value as a treatment. At this point, George C. Cotzias (1918‚Äì1977) made the critical observation that converted the transient response into a successful, large scale treatment. By starting with very small doses of DOPA, given orally every two hours under continued observation, and gradually increasing the dose he was able to stabilize patients on large enough doses to cause a dramatic remission of their symptoms. The first study reporting improvements in patients with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with L-dopa was published in 1968.New England Journal of Medicine [1968] 278 (11) : 630 (Cotzias, G) \\"L-Dopa for Parkinsonism\\" The result was soon confirmed by other investigators and has now become the standard treatment for Parkinsonian symptoms. Dr. Cotzias is the winner of the 1969 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. He received honorary degrees from Catholic University, Santiago (1969); Women‚Äôs Medical College of Pennsylvania (1970); St. John's University, New York (1971); and, the National and Kapodistrian University, Athens (1974). Lewis Thomas called him as \\"one of the great figures in American medical science.\\" Cotzias appears as a minor character in the American poet James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover.

Offices ENS House Cape Town In August 2012, ENSafrica became the first African headquartered law firm with integrated offices across different African jurisdictions, with the opening of offices in Rwanda and Burundi, which office was closed in 2015. This was shortly followed by another office opening in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in December 2012. In December 2013, ENSafrica announced a merger with Mauritius‚Äô largest and oldest firm, De Comarmond & Koenig. On 1 November 2014, the firm announced the opening of two offices in the Namibian capital and town of Windhoek and Swakopmund respectively, with a third Namibian office, in Walvis Bay, opening soon thereafter. This was done through a merger with local Namibian law firm Lorentz Angula. Former CEO, Piet Faber, is quoted (31 March 2014) as saying that ENSafrica will open offices in at least six other African jurisdictions over the next two years. On 1 May 2015, the firm announced the opening of its 13th office on the African continent, following a merger with local Tanzanian law firm, Rex Attorneys. In 2015, ENSafrica closed its Burundi office.https://www.ensafrica.com/contact ENSafrica: locations The most recent office to be opened was formed through a merger with local Ghanaian firm Oxford & Beaumont Solicitors, and formally opened as ENSafrica Ghana on 1 December 2015.

The firm subsequently withdrew from the case, resulting in Malema accusing the firm of racism. Ultimately, on 12 September 2011, Malema was convicted of hate speech. Tax Evasion In a court action brought in the Western Cape High Court in 2018, the South African Revenue Service claimed that ENSafrica created a R3.5 billion tax evasion scheme involving Christo Wiese and Tullow Oil. In addition to pursuing Christo Wiese and Tullow Oil, the South African Revenue Service is also pursuing a former ENSafrica executive.http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2018-07-18-christo-wiese-tullow- oil-and-enss-tax-dodging-services References Category:Law firms of South Africa Category:Companies based in Johannesburg Category:Law firms established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in South Africa ","title":"ENSafrica"},{"id":"24075924","text":"P≈ôechovice is a village and municipality (obec) in Strakonice District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

Notable members have included President Harry S. Truman and others. Founding The club was founded in 1887 by Arthur E. Stillwell as the Fairmount Cycling Club, a bicycling club in Fairmount Park in Kansas City. In 1893, the club changed its name to the Kansas City Athletic Club. In the early 20th century, it was nationally known for fielding championship Amateur Athletic Union teams. Amateur Basketball Beginning in the early 1900s, the club's amateur basketball team, the Blue Diamonds, became a nationally known powerhouse, notably after defeating the Buffalo Germans in 1905 - the de facto national basketball champion who had won the championship at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. Phog Allen was one of the club's team's star players.The Golden Age of Amateur Basketball: The AAU Tournament - Adolph H. Grundman (Author) - 1921-1968 - Bison Books (October 1, 2004) The Blue Diamonds defeated both the University of Kansas in its 1898-99 inaugural season and the University of Missouri in its 1906-07 inaugural season. In the 1920s, at a time when universities, corporate sponsored teams, and private clubs all competed in the same bracket, the club played in six national championship games:http://hoopedia.nba.com/index.php?title=AAU_Men's_Champions *1921 - 1st, 42-36 (defeating Southwest Kansas College) *1922 - 2nd, 42-28 (losing to Lowe and Campbell Athletic Goods of Kansas City) *1923 - 1st, 31-18 (defeating Hillyard, Inc.

In March 1917, the board proposed a merger with the Kansas City Club. But after a joint board meeting of the two clubs, the Kansas City Club's board rejected the proposal. Instead, in 1923, the club acquired an unfinished, 22-story building at Eleventh Street and Baltimore Avenue in Downtown Kansas City. The club hired architect firm Hoit, Price & Barnes, and completed the building.http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&id;=121863http://web2.umkc.edu/whmckc/Collections/IKC0153.HTM In 1932, however, during the Great Depression, the Continental Hotel Company took over the 22-story clubhouse, leaving only the six topmost floors devoted to the club itself. For a period in the 1960s, the hotel contained a branch of the Playboy Club.http://forum.kcrag.com/index.php?action=printpage;topic=14054.0 In 1982, the building was remodeled and renamed as the Mark Twain Tower, an office building. The club retained the rights to the top six floors. On February 29, 2016, the Mark Twain Tower was purchased by National Historic Property Developer Hudson Holdings. Located in Delray Beach, Florida, Hudson Holdings' mission is the acquisition, development and adaptive reuse of significant and large scale retail, residential, hotel and office properties.

His epithet is \\"the heavenly one\\"; he shoes the dead man's horse, thus helping him on his journey to the other side. He is a close friend of the Narts. It is important to note that despite being associated with other blacksmith deities in different Indo-European mythologies (like Vulcan) he does not have the status of a god. Ossetian mythology is considered to be monotheistic, with only Xwytsau being considered God, and all the others (called z√¶dt√¶ and d√¶wd≈æyt√¶) being considered deities of a lower class.  Etymology  Ossetian is a contraction of , where Kurd and Al√¶ are epithets, meaning \\"blacksmith\\" and \\"Alan/Aryan\\", respectively, and W√¶rgon is the original name of Kurdal√¶gon. The whole phrase means \\"Alan/Aryan Blacksmith W√¶rgon\\". Kurd originates from *kur-ta- or *kur-tar-, which is agent noun of *kur- \\"to heat\\", \\"to incandesce\\". Ossetian al√¶ originates from arya-, and originally meant \\"Aryan\\", and later \\"Alan\\". The original name W√¶rgon is derived from Old Ossetic *w√¶rg \\"wolf\\" (see Warg). The linguist Vasily Abaev compares it to the name of the Roman god Vulcan.  See also  * Tlepsh * Vulcan * Kaveh the blacksmith  Notes   References  * Abaev, V.I.

It was triggerred by the death of the sitting Liberal Party MP Charles Seale-Hayne. The election was contested by the Conservative and Liberal parties and won by the Liberal candidate, Harry Trelawney Eve, with a majority of 1,476 votes. Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death on 22 November 1903 of the sitting Liberal Party MP Charles Seale-Hayne, who had held the seat since the 1885 general election.The Times, 23 November 1903 p6 Candidates Liberals The Liberals adopted Harry Trelawney Eve KC, a 57-year-old barrister who practiced at the Chancery Bar. Eve had connections with Devon. He owned land in the county at Yarner Wood near Bovey Traceyhttp://jearnshaw.me.uk/pictures/yarner.htm and farmed it professionally,The Times, 11 December 1917 p12 taking a particular interest in the breeding of South Devon cattle.The British Year Book of Agriculture and Agricultural Who‚Äôs Who; Vinton & Co, 1908 p500 He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the county in 1903 and his wife came from Torquay.Who was Who, OUP 2007 He identified himself as a Radical and a supporter of Free Trade.The Times, 3 December 1903 p5 Conservatives The Conservative candidate was Sir Richard Harrison, a recently retired professional soldier, educated at Harrow School. Sir Richard was aged 66 years, had a home in BrixhamWho was Who, OUP 2007 and owned a farm in Hampshire.The Times, 1 January 1904 p4 Issues Trade Eve, having from the outset adopted the traditional Liberal stance as a Free Trader, made the most of this position to attack government policy on tariff reform and to warn that this would lead to taxes on food.The Times, 7 December 1903 p6 Harrison supported the government line, arguing that this was the only effective way to deal with the unfair competition to which British industry and trade were being subjected by foreign countries and that it would maintain a strong home manufacturing base to guarantee full employment.The Times, 12 December 1903 p12 Harrison received a letter of support from Joseph Chamberlain arguing that agriculture was one of the industries which had suffered most from unrestricted imports and contending that tariff reform proposals would not add a penny to the cost of living while helping farmers and allotment holders.The Times 5 January 1904 p8 It was reported that the arguments concerning cheap food found most resonance among the town-dwellers of the constituency and the agricultural labourers, a traditional source of strength for the Liberal Party in the area.The Times, 1 January 1904 p4 The attempts of the Tariff Reform League to hold a public meeting in Newton Abbott during the election campaign proved a bit of a disaster. The meeting was first disrupted by about a hundred Radicals singing political songs, causing the speakers to delay but then a fight broke out in the hall and the meeting had to be abandoned for fear of violence to the speakers. Once the speakers had withdrawn the fighting got worse and a lot of damage was done.The Times, 4 January 1904 p4 However The Times reported that Newton Abbott had a reputation for rowdyism at times of political excitement and the incident was unlikely to affect the outcome of the election but it did note that the future meeting of the Tariff Reform League had been postponed.The Times, 5 January 1904 p8 Education The Education Act 1902 provided Eve with a campaigning issue to appeal to his traditional supporters. The Act handed over responsibility for education from local school boards to borough or county education authorities. The Act also brought voluntary schools under some control of the government, giving them funding. The nonconformist and dissenting religionists, who were by and large Liberal supporters, resented this funding of Anglican and Roman Catholic church schools from the general rates. ‚ÄòNo Rome on the Rates‚Äô was the rallying cry.David M Thompson (ed.),Protestant Nonconformist Texts: Volume 4, The Twentieth Century, Ashgate, 2006-7 p.219 Eve raised this subject early in the election campaign, at his adoption meeting,The Times, 3 December 1903 p5 realising its resonance for committed Liberals and their traditional constituency of nonconformist church and chapel-goers. The Liberals also hoped to pick up votes from Conservative nonconformists.The Times, 4 January 1904 p4 Harrison took a neutral line on the 1902 Act. He said it had been controversial but was now law and should be given a complete and fair trial, while being monitored for discrimination against particular religious groups.The Times, 12 December 1903 p12 The Armed Forces In the aftermath of the Boer Wars and given his own military background it was not surprising that Harrison felt comfortable dealing with issues around the armed forces. He supported the proposals being contemplated to reform the administration of the War Office and he favoured the introduction of a comprehensive scheme to improve the strength, efficiency and organisation of all Britain‚Äôs military ‚Äì particularly the navy.The Times, 12 December 1903 p12 These measures were the subject of Royal Commissions established in 1902. The Esher and Norfolk Committees eventually bore fruit in certain reforms brought in by the Conservative Hugh Arnold-Foster in 1904-05J K Dunlop, The development of the British Army 1899‚Äì1914; Methuen, 1938 pp. 179-83, 193-4 but ironically major reform had to wait until the new Liberal government of December 1905 and the implementation of the Haldane Reforms.Pat Thane, R B Haldane in Cassell‚Äôs Companion to Twentieth Century Britain; Cassell & Co, 2001 p185 Result Eve held Ashburton for the Liberals with a majority of 1,476. The size of the majority was larger than expected, doubling Seale-Hayne‚Äôs majority at the 1900 general election. The Times commented that the government clearly needed to do more in agricultural constituencies to persuade voters of the value of protectionism.The Times, 9 January 1904 p9 The fact was that the Conservative government re-elected in 1900 and which first came to office in 1895 was by now appearing stale and weary to the electorate. The government would in the year following the by-election give up the ghost and allow the creation of a Liberal administration in December 1905, an administration which would go on in the general election of January‚ÄìFebruary 1906 to secure a landslide mandate from the electorate. In the sixty by-elections between 1895 and 1905 the Liberal poll went up, overall, by 30% and the Unionist poll went down by 7%.

Compassionate release procedures, which are also known as medical release, medical parole, medical furlough and humanitarian parole, can be mandated by the courts or by internal corrections authorities. Unlike parole, compassionate release is not based on a prisoner's behavior or sentencing, but on medical or humanitarian changes in the prisoner's situation. Request process Obtaining a compassionate release for a prison inmate is a process that varies from country to country (and sometimes even within countries) but generally involves petitioning the warden or court to the effect that the subject is terminally ill and would benefit from obtaining aid outside of the prison system, or is otherwise eligible under the relevant law. Compassionate release is most often granted to inmates with terminal illnesses that cause life expectancies of time periods less than between six and eighteen months, depending on the jurisdiction. Other allowable causes for compassionate release may be medical but non-terminal, such as incurable debilitating mental or physical conditions that prevent inmate self-care or a combination of advanced age and irreversible age-related conditions that prevent functioning in a prison setting. Prisoners with illness such as Alzheimer's would be considered eligible for release. Grounds for compassionate release may also be familial, although not all jurisdictions offer this option. Under United States Federal law for example inmates may be released to care for a minor child or debilitated spouse in the absence of other family caregivers. This is intended to be subsequent to the death or debilitation of the child's primary caregiver in the former case or the finding of permanent mental or physical disability of the spouse in the latter. While there are clear advantages to the individual in this type of release, there are many procedural obstacles to this type of petition which lead to it rarely being granted. Arguments Debate as to the relative merits of compassionate release is ongoing, and major arguments are presented below. Proponents Arguments for expansion of compassionate release programs generally address the benefit to terminally ill prisoners as well as cost savings to the state. Terminal illness which requires special care or treatment is a major concern for prison inmates who may be unable to access the same type or quality of care in prison as they would outside of an institutional setting. These illnesses can further shorten the lifespan of the individual while he or she is in prison, a setting that already has poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the general population. The Bureau of Prisons estimates that the United States would save $5.8 million per year by releasing 100 people on compassionate release per year,\\"The Federal Bureau of Prisons‚Äô Compassionate Release Program.\\" and overcrowding would be lessened. Those who are approved for compassionate release have a lower tendency to recommit crime,O'Meara, Gregory. \\"Compassion and the Public Interest: Wisconsin's New Compassionate Release Legislation.\\" Federal Sentencing Reporter 23.1 (2010): 33-38. Print. which is attributed to those being released being in extremely poor health, as well as possibly due to the careful screening process inmates go through for risk of recidivism before approval for compassionate release can be granted. Opponents Compassionate release relies on good faith, requiring that the released inmates do not continue committing crimes after they have been released; while many of these criminals are in very poor health, some are not incapacitated, and their reintroduction into society puts them back into a setting where they would be free to commit crimes. A questionnaire study by Jennifer Boothby and Lorraine Overduin on attitudes towards compassionate release suggested that the general public have negative attitudes towards the compassionate release of prisoners.Boothby, Jennifer, and Lorraine Overduin. \\"Attitudes Regarding the Compassionate Release of Terminally Ill Offenders.\\" The Prison Journal 87.4 (2007): 408-15. Print. This suggests that the community's negative attitudes toward compassionately released prisoners could be an obstacle to those seeking an expansion of this type of resentencing, and that there is a negative attitude in communities over mingling with those convicted of crimes meriting time potentially up to life sentences. Another argument against compassionate release is fairness and concern over justice for time served; for those that were placed in prison justifiably, the question arises of how long they should be forced to serve for their crimes before they are allowed renewed access to their community for health and support, and state and federal laws generally stipulate guidelines that address minimum proportions of sentences that must be served prior to eligibility for compassionate release. The process of obtaining compassionate release on medical grounds has been criticized in multiple states for being highly subjective on a case-by-case basis, relying heavily on specific doctors' opinions and for not having sufficiently clear-cut guidelines as to what defines a patient as being eligible for compassionate release. This often results in calls for reform, fueled by statistics regarding the rate of compassionate release and the illnesses of the patients who do not receive it. Implementation A major roadblock to the implementation of compassionate release is its reliance on medical trial. Because the criteria for medically based petitions for compassionate release are, by necessity, dependent on medicine and doctors, individual medical professionals have an inordinate amount of power in determining each compassionate release case. Because of the high degree of variation among individual medical professionals, the high variation that is translated into each decision is a major issue in many of the current compassionate release systems. The inconsistency of current systems of compassionate release is a common flaw that hinders increased use of compassionate release. Other options For prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses, alternative options include programs that distribute health materials and segregation of affected individualsAldenberg, William B. \\"Bursting at the Seams: An Analysis of Compassionate-Release Statutes and the Current Problem of HIV and AIDS in U.S. Prisons and Jails.\\" New England journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement 24.2 (1998): 541-98. Print. and expanded hospice programs. Hospice programs within the prisons have been used, although this does not address the humanitarian aspect of allowing inmates to die with dignity among family and friends, and the issue of cost to the state still looms large. Specialized medical care in a prison setting is difficult to achieve and is a costly proposition. With the prison population aging and in poorer health than the general population, as previously mentioned, cost may become a prohibitive factor, increasing the attraction of compassionate release where possible. For non-medical cases such as care for a family member in the absence of other available parties, practical alternatives are difficult to identify. A minor child or disabled spouse for whom no other caregiver is available is likely to end up as a ward of the courts or in institutional care if the compassionate release request is not granted. As of 2009, Corrections systems with compassionate release procedures included the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons (often known as the BOP), Scotland, England and Wales, China,^ \\"China Grants Convicted Scholars Medical Parole\\". The Chronicle of Higher Education. http://chronicle.com/weekly/v47/i47/47a04501.htm. Retrieved 2008-01-13. France, New Zealand and 36 of the 50 U.S. state prison systems.https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-13-furloughs_N.htm \\"36 states release ill or dying inmates\\" By country New Zealand New Zealand legislation includes a provision for prisoners to apply for compassionate release from prison. Section 41 of the Parole Act 2002 provides that the Parole board may, on referral by the chairperson, direct that an offender be released on compassionate release on either of the following grounds: (a) the offender has given birth to a child or (b) the offender is seriously ill and is unlikely to recover. The Department of Corrections is not responsible for decisions regarding compassionate release of prisoners. When a prisoner is seriously ill and unlikely to recover, an application will be made to the New Zealand Parole Board where an independent decision will be made.\\"Compassionate Release\\" (17 May 2017) (Obtained under Official Information Act 1982 Request to the Department of Corrections) All prisoners in New Zealand are eligible for compassionate release. The length of a sentence or eligibility for parole are not factors that will affect the prisoner's ability to apply for compassionate release.(18 February 2009) 652 NZPD 1420 In November 2016, a high-profile prisoner, Vicki Ravana Letele was granted compassionate release from prison. Letele was sentenced to three years and two months for ten charges of dishonestly using a document. The application for compassionate release was based on Letele's diagnosis of metastatic cancer. Her illness was terminal with a life expectancy of 6 months. The chairman of the Parole Board, Hon J W Gendall initially declined Letele's release on compassionate grounds, citing that \\"it is quite often the case that prisoners contract or are diagnosed with serious illness but if they can be adequately treated and managed in prison and death is not imminent that compassionate release is not appropriate. It is not the case that family and others may reasonably believe that the prisoner should be in care of his/her family at such difficult times.\\" The serving Prime Minister of New Zealand in 2016, Sir John Key, voiced his opinion on the Letele case following widespread public outcry and protest. Key stated that \\"I would have thought we were a pretty compassionate country. We do need to take on board the criminal activity that the person‚Äôs undertaken but I don‚Äôt think we want to see people dying in prison if, on compassionate grounds, it‚Äôs reasonable they be returned home.\\" Initial conflicting views between the Ministry of Justice and the Parole Board resolved on 10 November 2016, when the Parole Board under s41(3) of the Parole Act 2002 ordered the compassionate release of Letele. The decision factored in that there was no offending history, the prison security classification was low and Letele was plainly seriously ill and unlikely to recover. In the last financial year of 2015/2016 seven prisoners were released on compassionate grounds, all cases determined on the basis that they were seriously ill and unlikely to recover. Figures from the years 2006 ‚Äì 2013 revealed a total of twenty-five applications, with three of those declined. The application process for compassionate release can be difficult to achieve in a timely manner, which is one of the reasons that very few applications are received.Kerryn Lum \\"Palliative care behind bars: the New Zealand prison hospice experience\\" (2004) 17.3-4 Journal of pain and palliative care pharmacotherapy 131 at 135. Other reasons include the likelihood of a prisoner dying in prison before an application is approved, and an absence of reasonable and available support from family if a prisoner is released from prison. Furthermore, long-stay prisoners may not wish to be released; the prison may be regarded as home, and fellow inmates as family. Human rights approach In practice, the Parole Board only releases prisoners on compassionate release if they are seriously ill and unlikely to recover. However, the Act also provides for compassionate release of a prisoner when they have given birth to a child. Prison management first assess the prisoner's suitability, taking account of security classification, the welfare of the prisoner and the child, and the views of the Ministry for Vulnerable Children Oranga Tamariki (formerly Child Youth and Family). A report is then submitted to the Parole Board. Libby Robins \\"Mother and baby prison units: An investigative study\\" (paper presented to Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, Christchurch, May 2012) However, the establishment of mother and baby units in prisons has made this provision practically void. The reason it has not been removed from the Act is because it would violate New Zealand's International Human Rights obligations and be in contravention of s19 of the Bill of Rights Act; Freedom from Discrimination,New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 s19 if it were not available.Sandra Goudie \\"Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill ‚Äì Initial Briefing\\" (29 April 2009) at [18] Comparatively, compassionate release is based on underlying principles of human dignity. Dignity in this sense refers to the right of a human being to have inherent equal and inalienable rights to achieve social progress and better standards of living. Preventing the release of seriously ill prisoners would undeniably violate their human dignity.Universal Declaration of Human Rights http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf The 2004 review of Human Rights in New Zealand stated that the vulnerability of people in detention was one of New Zealand's most pressing human rights issues.Human Rights in New Zealand \\"Rights of people who are detained\\" (2010) at [351] The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child United Nations Convention on the Right's of the Child (UNCROC)Convention on the Rights of the Child 1577 UNTS (opened for signature 20 November 1989, entered into force 2 September 1990) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) \\"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1249 UNTS (opened for signature 18 December 1979, entered into force September 3 1981)\\" are the relevant conventions in relation to compassionate release. In practice, the Department of Corrections supports a child's contact with parents who are in prison when it is in the best interests of the child. Prisoners are encouraged to have positive relationships with their children so they can better reintegrate on release.Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Fifth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2015) These principles uphold New Zealand's obligations under Article 9 of UNCROC: Separation from Parents, and includes several programs including ‚ÄòMothers with Babies Units‚Äô, ‚ÄòMothers and Bonding Facilities‚Äô and importantly, ‚ÄòPrison Activities Centres‚Äô that teach fathers parenting skills. Similarly, under New Zealand's obligations in Article 12 of CEDAW Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1249 UNTS (opened for signature 18 December 1979, entered into force 3 September 1981) improvements were made in women's correctional facilities to include ‚ÄòMothers with Babies Units‚Äô allowing mothers to keep their children with them in prison up until the age of two, where it was previously 9 months. The aim of this is to achieve a reduction in re-offending for the women and increase their children's life chances.Ministry of Social Development United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women: Eighth Periodic Report by the Government of New Zealand (2016) Compassionate release must be available to prisoners following the birth of a child in order to meet the obligations that are specified in these conventions. In practice, the incorporation of units that enable a relationship between a mother and child in prison are consistent with the obligations that New Zealand has in the context of international human rights. This explains the apparent non- existence of compassionate release on the ground that a prisoner has given birth. United Kingdom England and Wales England and Wales allow applications for early release on compassionate grounds for prisoners serving determinate or indeterminate sentences.HM Prison Service Prison Service Order 6000 Parole, Release and Recall (31 March 2005) at [12] Three general principles are applied during the decision-making process: the safety of the public, new information not available to the court, and whether there was a specific purpose for the early release.Gabrielle Garton Brimwood and Pat Strickland \\"Early release from prison in England and Wales: an overview\\" (Home Affairs Section, 15 May 2013) at [6] The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 s10 provides that the Secretary of State may at any time release a prisoner if they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner's release on compassionate grounds.Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (UK) s10 Compassionate release will be considered where the prisoner is terminally ill, bedridden or severely incapacitated. Where terminal illness is the case, no specific timescale is strictly followed, however a life expectancy of three months or less is suggested. Prisoners serving determinate sentences are also eligible for compassionate release based on tragic family circumstances. Prisoners serving indeterminate sentences are excluded from this provision and are subject to further restricting criteria in an application for compassionate release on the basis of terminal illness. They will be assessed on the risk of re-offending, particularly of a sexual or violent nature, whether further imprisonment would reduce their life expectancy, whether adequate arrangements are available outside prison, and whether early release will provide some significant benefit to their family. Where conditions are self-induced, such as a hunger strike or refusal of treatment, an application may be declined. The aging prison population The rates of death from natural causes have doubled in eight years, with 199 deaths occurring in prison in 2016. The age of the prison population is rising because of a shift in major sentencing trends; prison terms are increasingly longer for the older population. The Prison Reform Trust called for a review of the current compassionate release process, commenting on the difficulty that a medical professional will have diagnosing a three-month life expectancy. The Trust recommended that a one-year life expectancy be sufficient for an application of compassionate release from prison. Former Deputy Director of the Trust observed that older prisoners who are terminally ill are unlikely to pose a risk to the public. His belief was that a range of options should be considered, including compassionate release to ensure that people spend their last days with dignity.Tamsin Snow \\"Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?\\"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 13 High-profile cases such as the release of Reggie Kray in 2000 and Ronnie Briggs in 2009 raised issues regarding the term ‚Äòcompassionate release‚Äô.Tamsin Snow \\"Should dying prisoners be given their freedom for a more dignified end?\\"(2009) 23 Health and Medical Collection 12 at 12 The idea that compassion should be exercised in relation to prisoners was a concept that did not reconcile with popular societal views. Costs associated with medical care for the elderly and terminally ill was noted, with acceptance of the costs that are incurred sending prison guards to hospital and providing palliative care within the prison environment. However, early release is largely deemed to be socially incompatible. Human rights of older persons Compassionate release is founded on a humanitarian concern for the dying, and practical reasons such as high costs or the inability to care adequately for such persons in prison.Wiebke Bretschneider et al \\"The collision of care and punishment: Ageing prisoners‚Äô view on compassionate release\\" (2017) 19 Punishment and Society 5 at 11 Prison is generally deemed unsuitable for compassionate end- of-life care due to its punitive purpose. NB Mahon \\"Introduction: Death and dying behind bars ‚Äì Cross-cutting themes and policy imperatives\\" (1999) 27 Journal of Law and Medicine Ethics 213 at 215 End-of-life care exists in prisons in England and Wales, however, the adequacy of the care has been challenged, as the opposing goals of security and compassionate care are said to be mutually exclusive. In May 2016, the Council of Europe European Committee on Crime Problems issued a white paper on prison overcrowding. The paper addressed the root causes of prison overcrowding and supports the wide application for early release for the seriously ill and aged prisoners on compassionate grounds.European Committee on Crime Problems White Paper on Prison Overcrowding (Directorate General Human Rights and Rule of Law, June 2016) A 2011 report to the UN Secretary-General highlighted the difficulties with the aging population, particularly in regard to long-term care of the elderly. This is made worse by the lack of legal framework to monitor human rights violations in long-term care facilities.Officer of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Human Rights of Older Persons (Summary of the Report to the Secretary-General to the General Assembly, 2011) Dying and suffering are not part of a prisoner's punishment.NN Dubler \\"The collision of confinement and care: End-of-life care in prisons and jails\\" (1998) 26 The Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics 149 at 156 Human rights recommendations for aging prisoners advocate that necessary changes should be made to adapt to the older prisoner's physical and mental health. If changes cannot be adequately implemented, then compassionate release of the prisoner should be considered in order not to violate Article 3 on inhumane and degrading treatment of the European Convention on Human Rights.European Convention of Human Rights (opened for signature 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) ;Scotland The Scottish legal system permits compassionate release for terminal illness. There are only a few applications per year, and most are granted. A prominent case was that of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, released on 20 August 2009 because of prostate cancer.  United States  In the United States forms of compassionate release are found both federally and in the laws of thirty-nine states. With the rapid increase in prison populations following the introduction of mandatory minimum sentencing laws in the 1990s, many people have called for the expanded use of compassionate release as a \\"safety valve\\" to relieve overcrowded prison systems and reduce pressure on government budgets as well as to ease suffering of inmates and their families. Some states have recently expanded their own forms of compassionate release, as can be seen in New York's changes to its medical parole laws to include both the terminally ill and chronically ill inmates in the absence of a prognosis of imminent death, although this has not necessarily resulted in more releases. Many who are eligible for compassionate release on grounds of terminal illness and who have applications pending die in prison before their cases are processed due to case backlogs and narrow interpretation of the law. The issue of where and how to best deliver end of life care has been compounded by the sheer number of prisoners now incarcerated in the United States, as well as by the aging of the prison population. Federal laws governing compassionate release include 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)1(A), which came into effect on 1 November 1987 and governs those whose offenses occurred since it was enacted, and 18 U.S.C. 4205(g), the previous version, which still controls release of inmates who were convicted of offenses that occurred on or prior to that date. States that offer compassionate release each have their own laws governing eligibility, and it may differ from the federal versions both in the requirements for eligibility and in the type of release that can be granted, for example medical parole rather than resentencing. To seek compassionate release, federal inmates must file a petition with the warden. Compassionate release is only granted \\"when there are particularly extraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing.\\"Compassionate Release, Procedures For Implementation 18 USC 3582/4205, Notable recipients In 2013, the terminally ill Herman Wallace was released from Angola Prison to spend the rest of his life in a personal care home. He died a few days later. One notable recipient of compassionate release was Lynne Stewart, a criminal defense attorney who was convicted of passing messages from imprisoned terrorist Omar Abdel-Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\") to his followers in al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya. Judge John Koeltl sentenced Stewart to ten years in prison, but on December 31, 2013, Koeltl ordered Stewart released from federal prison due to her terminal breast cancer. Koeltl cited the incurable nature of Stewart's disease and the \\"relatively limited risk\\" of recidivism and danger to the community upon release. She was 74 years old at the time of her release from the Federal Medical Center Carswell in Texas where she had been held, and had served just over four years of her sentence. Stewart died in March 2017.Joseph P. Fried, Lynne Stewart, Lawyer Imprisoned in Terrorism Case, Dies at 77, The New York Times (March 7, 2017). Variation among states Different states have various policies on compassionate release system, varying on details such as the life expectancy required to warrant compassionate release.

A section of the roof of the turbine hall collapsed; all but one of the ten turbines were damaged or destroyed. The entire plant output, totaling 6,400 MW ‚Äì a significant portion of the supply to the local area ‚Äì was lost, leading to widespread power outages. An official report on the accident was issued in October 2009.  Background  Diagram showing a cross-section of the dam The Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station is located on the Yenisei River. Before the accident, it was the largest hydroelectric power station in Russia and the sixth-largest hydroelectric power station in the world, by average power generation. The plant is operated by RusHydro. On 2 July 2009, RusHydro announced the station's all-time highest electricity output per 24 hours.  Turbine 2  A model of a power unit, comprising turbine and generator, of the Sayano- Shushenskaya plant Turbines of the type used in this power plant have a very narrow working band at high efficiency regimes. If this band is exceeded the turbines begin to vibrate, caused by the pulsation of water flow and water strokes. These vibrations and shocks cause the turbines to degrade over time. Turbine 2 had experienced problems for a long time prior to the 2009 accident. The first of these appeared after its installation in 1979. Throughout 1980-1983, numerous problems with seals, turbine shaft vibrations and bearings surfaced. From the end of March to the end of November 2000, a complete reconditioning of turbine 2 was performed. Cavities up to deep and cracks up to long were found on the turbine runner and repaired. Many other defects were found in the turbine bearings and subsequently repaired. In 2005, further repairs were made to turbine 2\\\\. The problems found were similar in several aspects to the defects observed during the previous repair. From January to March 2009, turbine 2 was undergoing scheduled repairs and modernization. It was the first and only turbine in the station which was equipped with a new electro-hydraulic regulator of its rotational speed supplied by the Promavtomatika company. During the course of the repair, the turbine blades were welded, because after a long period of operation, cracks and cavities had once again appeared. The turbine runner was not properly rebalanced after these repairs, following which turbine 2 had increased vibrations, ca for the main bearing during the full load of the turbine. While this did not exceed specifications, the increased vibrations were unacceptable for long term use. The elevated vibration levels compared to other turbines were apparent for turbine 2 before the repair as well. The vibrations exceeded the allowed specification in the beginning of July and continued to increase with accelerated speed. On the night of 16‚Äì17 August, the level of vibration increased substantially, and there were several attempts to stop the turbine. During 16 August up to 20:30, the load of turbine 2 was 600 MW, then it was reduced to 100‚Äì200 MW. On 17 August 2009 at 3:00, the load was increased again to 600 MW; at 3:30, the load was decreased to 200 MW; and at 3:45, it was increased again to 600 MW. During this time, the level of vibration was very high, and was also registered by seismic instruments in the plant. During attempts to shut it down, the rotor inside the turbine was pushed up, which in turn created pressure pushing up on the turbine cover, which was kept in place by 80 bolts, each 8 cm in diameter. During the morning of 17 August 2009, 50 people were gathered around turbine 2\\\\. As the plant general director, Nikolai Nevolko, was celebrating his anniversary, early in the morning he went to Abakan to greet the arriving guests, and none of the workers present wanted, or had the authority, to make decisions about further actions regarding the turbine. It seems they were used to the high levels of vibration. Turbine 2 was started on 16 August 2009 at 23:14 local time. At 23:44 it was running at a full load of 600 MW. During the night, its load varied between 10 and 610 MW. At the moment of the accident, which was 8:13 local time (00:13 GMT), its load was 475 MW and water consumption was . Vibration of the bearing was , which far exceeded the values of the other turbines by more than fourfold. The working life defined by the manufacturer for the turbines was specified as 30 years. At the moment of the accident, the age of the turbine was 29 years and 10 months. On 17 August 2009, the turbines were at a working level of . At this pressure the recommended power band for the turbines is 570‚Äì640 MW (band III) and the allowed band is 0-265 MW also (band I). Band 265‚Äì570 MW (band II) at this pressure is not recommended and output over 640 MW (band IV) is forbidden. On the day of the accident, turbine 2 worked as the plant's power output regulator and due to this, its output power changed constantly. The turbine often operated in the band II regime, which is accompanied by pulsation and strokes in the water flow.  Accident The accident occurred on 17 August 2009 at 08:13 local time (00:13 GMT). There was a loud bang from turbine 2. The turbine cover shot up and the rotor then shot out of its seat. After this, water spouted from the cavity of the turbine into the machinery hall. As a result, the machinery hall and rooms below its level were flooded. At the same time, an alarm was received at the power station's main control panel, and the power output fell to zero, resulting in a local blackout. The steel gates to the water intake pipes of the turbines, weighing each, were closed manually by opening the valves with hydraulic jacks keeping them up between 8:35 and 9:20 hours (9.30 by official report). The operation took 25 minutes, which is near the minimum time (highest speed) allowed for this operation. The emergency diesel generator was started at 11:32. At 11:50, the opening of 11 spillway gates of the dam was started and was finished at 13:07. 75 people were later found dead. Nine out of the ten turbines were operating at the time, with a total output 4,400 MW. Turbine 6 was undergoing scheduled maintenance, but was ready for a restart. Oleg Myakishev, a survivor of the accident, described it as follows: > ‚Ä¶I was standing upstairs when I heard some sort of growing noise, then I saw > the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. Then I saw the rotor > rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It > rose about three meters.

Around 200 people were evacuated. There were no fatalities or injuries. According to RusHydro the fire was extinguished \\"within a few minutes\\". Investigation On 4 October 2009, the official report about Sayano-Shushenskaya hydro accident was published by the Federal Environmental, Technological and Atomic Supervisory Service (Rostekhnadzor) on its website. However, later the report and the press release on the report were removed from the website. Names of people killed and those who bear responsibility for the accident, and other data including a historical and technical review about the plant and plans for its future, are given in the report. The report states that the accident was primarily caused by the turbine vibrations which led to the fatigue damage of the mountings of the turbine 2, including the cover of the turbine. It was also found that at the moment of accident at least six nuts were missing from the bolts securing the turbine cover. After the accident 49 recovered bolts were investigated, of which 41 had fatigue cracks. On 8 bolts, the fatigue damaged area exceeded 90% of the total cross-sectional area. According to this report, on 17 August 2009 at 1:20AM (local time) there was a fire at the hydroelectric power station of Bratsk which broke both communications and the automatic driving systems of other power plants in the region, including Sayano-Shushenskaya. The situation was recovered on 17 August 2009 at 15:03. At 8:12 am local time, turbine 2's output power was reduced by the turbine regulator and it entered into the non- recommended powerband II. Shortly after this, the bolts keeping the turbine cover in place broke, and under water pressure of about , the spinning turbine with its cover, rotor, and upper parts started to move up, destroying machinery hall installations. At the same time, pressurized water flooded the rooms and damaged plant constructions. According to Rostekhnadzor, the automatic shutdown system of the water intake pipes' gates failed after failure of the turbine 2. This accusation was dismissed by Rakurs, the company which designed the automated safety system for the plant. Media speculation According to the newspaper Izvestia, the increased vibration of turbine 2 was going on for some 10 years and was well-known to the plant personnel. According to the former director of Irkutskenergo, Viktor Bobrovski, the accident could have been caused by an incorrect start-up process of the turbine which resulted in a hydraulic pressure surge, or excess load of the turbine caused by peak consumption of electricity. According to Bobrovski, it is common practice in the region to compensate for a peak load by overloading hydroelectric power plants, and the energy system of the region is near collapse, as the main goal of its owners is to take out as much profit as possible, typically by cutting down on maintenance, investment, safety, and educational costs. Since the load for other turbines ceased after the collapse of the turbine 2, they probably started to spin without load at increasing speed until they failed. He said that the former director of Sayano- Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station, Valentin Bryzgalov, had alerted that it is dangerous to operate the plant at its maximum loads when the turbines are starting to vibrate in the axial direction. He said that the accident probably would not have had such catastrophic results if the safety systems had worked and the safety rules had been followed. The former general director of the plant, Alexander Toloshinov, has said that the accident was most likely due to a \\"manufacturing defect\\" in a turbine. According to Toloshinov, the construction of the turbine blades of this type of turbine is not very reliable and cracks are known to develop in them under some working conditions. On 11 September 2009, RusHydro disputed allegations that the dam overwhelmed the machinery hall leading to the destruction of turbine 2\\\\. According to RusHydro, displacements of the dam are seasonal and have been reduced in recent years. The maximum displacement () was recorded in 2006, which was below the allowed maximum of . According to RusHydro, the scope of displacement between the anchor legs and the machinery hall does not exceed , which is less than the width between them (), and therefore the dam cannot overwhelm the machinery hall. On 21 August 2009, a website supporting rebel groups in Chechnya claimed that they were responsible for the blast, part of a new \\"economic war\\" which they were declaring on Russia. These claims were dismissed by authorities as \\"idiotic\\". In November 2010, a peer-reviewed article appeared in International Water Power and Dam Construction magazine by Mr. F.A. Hamill, P.E., Life Member American Society of Civil Engineers, Member US Society for Dams, and Project Engineering Manager of the Hydro and Water Resources group of a major US construction company. This article makes a very strong technical case for a previously unpostulated direct cause for the turbine failures: draft tube waterhammer. The immediate cause of this is proposed to be simply the too-sudden closure of the turbine wicket (flow- control) gates. Quoting from the article: This hypothesis is that the explosion was caused by water column separation in the draft tubes of the destroyed units. This condition can readily be caused by a too-rapid wicket gate closure during unit load rejection. Adjustment of governor times to unsafe values to achieve fast response to operating load changes may have occurred in recent times in response to a need to improve grid frequency control. This, combined with compromised stud connections due to poor maintenance, can explain the extreme violence of this accident. The article gives an extensive discussion of other possible causes, but presents an exceptionally strong and quantitative case for this phenomenon as the most reasonable explanation. https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/features/featuresayano-shushenskaya- accident-presenting-a-possible-direct-cause In another peer-reviewed article in Issue 2/2020 of hydrolink quarterly magazine of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR), Mr. Hamill reviewed the literature from the intervening decade and found that \\"nothing in the literature since the 2010 article has surfaced to cause a change in this conclusion.\\"https://static.iahr.org/library/HydroLink/HydroLink2020_02_Hydraulic_Transients_d9824750k893409.pdf Rescue operation After the accident, the spillway was regulated to decrease the water level of the reservoir by per day. Flood water was pumped out from the engine room by 24 August 2009. On 28 August, the search and rescue operation was completed, and the state of emergency imposed in Khakassia on 17 August 2009, was lifted.  Aftermath  As a result of the accident, 75 people were killed. On 19 August 2009, a mourning day was announced in Khakassia. RusHydro declared 25 August a day of mourning at the company. A festival in the city of Abakan on 22 August was canceled. Due to the accident, the town of Cheryomushki has banned the sale of strong alcoholic beverages. Damage In addition to turbine 2, turbines 7 and 9 also suffered severe damage and were destroyed, while the turbine room roof and ceilings fell on and caused additional damage to turbines 1 and 3, with slight damage to turbines 4, 5, 8, and 10. Turbine 6, which was in scheduled repair at the time of the accident, received only minor damage and was the only one of the station's 10 turbines that did not receive electrical damage due to shorting of the associated transformers. Water immediately flooded the engine and turbine rooms and caused a transformer explosion. Transformers 1 and 2 were destroyed, while transformers 3, 4, and 5 were left in satisfactory condition. Other damage was also severe as the machinery hall was destroyed, including the roof, ceilings, and floor. On 9 September 2009, RusHydro announced the damage caused by the incident: * Turbine 6: Flooded * Turbine 5: Flooding and electrical damage * Turbines 3 and 4: Moderate electrical and mechanical damage. Some damage to the concrete structures around them. * Turbines 1, 8, and 10: Severe electrical and mechanical damage. Some damage to the concrete structures around them. * Turbines 7 and 9: Completely destroyed, with extreme damage to the concrete structures around them. * Turbine 2: Destroyed completely, including the concrete structures around it. Power supply Power generation from the station ceased completely following the incident. The resulting blackout in residential areas was alleviated by diverting power from other plants. Aluminium smelters in Sayanogorsk and Khakassia were completely cut off from the grid before power supplies were replaced using alternate power sources. Power to blacked out areas was fully restored by 19 August 2009. Although smelters continue to work at their normal rate, RUSAL warned that in the longer term it may lose up to of aluminum output due to the power shortage, and called for accelerating the construction of the Boguchany hydroelectric power station to replace the lost generating capacity. Environmental impact The accident caused an oil spill, releasing at least of transformer oil which spread over downstream of Yenisei. The oil, which spilled during the approximately 2-3 hour cutoff of river flow when all the gates of the dam were closed, killed of cultivated trout in two riverside fisheries, with its impact on wildlife as yet unassessed. On 19 August 2009, the -long spill had reached , where it was cordoned off with floating barriers and chemical sorbents. The oil spill was fully removed by 25 August 2009. Financial impact Share prices Trading in RusHydro shares at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange was suspended for two days. After trading resumed on 19 August 2009, the shares dropped 11.4%. On the London Stock Exchange, the share price dropped more than 15%. It is expected that RusHydro's business losses will amount to 16.5 billion roubles (US$523 million) by 2013. The power plant was insured for US$200 million by Russian insurance company ROSNO, part of Allianz group, and re-insured by Munich Re. Compensation The Russian government decided to pay compensation of 1 million rubles (US$31,600) to each victim's family, and 100,000 rubles (about US$3,100) to each survivor, while RusHydro decided to pay a further 1 million rubles in compensation. RusHydro also decided to buy housing for 13 families of killed workers with underage children. There are also programs to support these children in kindergartens and schools and to provide higher education. In addition, a special program is planned for the reconstruction and development of the Cheryomushki settlement, the main settlement where the power plant workers live. Personnel The director of the plant, Nikolai Nevolko, was replaced by Valerii Kjari. Several people were awarded for their heroic actions during the accident. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, awarded Juri Salnikov and Oleg Melnitchuck each with an Official Letter of Commendation.  Repairs  Construction of the station and assembly of turbine 2 Repairs on a turbine, in 2011 At the time, repairs were estimated to take up to four years. Over 2,000 people were involved in the rescue work and liquidation of the consequences after the disaster. According to Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko, the rebuilding of the engine room alone was estimated to cost 40 billion rubles (‚Ç¨880 million, US$1.3 billion). Russia's Sberbank agreed to lend 20 billion rubles (‚Ç¨440 million, US$630 million) for the repair works. RusHydro also is negotiating a loan with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. According to RusHydro, turbines 4, 5, and 6 will probably be repaired. Turbines 7 and 9 were too damaged and are being disassembled. The machinery hall, heating system, electricity supply, and sewage tunnels were under repair. As the spillway works all the time, several methods of preventing the dam from icing were also under consideration. The machinery hall and its heating system is also underwent repairs. The repair work was performed continuously, 24 hours a day. For movement time of the spillway well crane –ö–ë–ì–°-1000 the spillway was reduced to . Near the end of 2009, there was an ongoing battle with icing. All 11 spillway gates were opened to 0.5 from the first step. 70 heat guns with a total output of 1,500 kW were provisionally installed under part of the recovered machinery hall roof to prevent it from icing. Chemical (MgCl2 6 H2O) and mechanical methods are also used against icing. By 27 December 2009, there were on-going or prepared dismantling of turbines 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Only turbines 5 and 6 were to be repaired in situ. The other turbines were to be replaced, repaired in the factory and/or modernized. Turbine 6 was restarted on 24 February 2010. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally switched turbine 6 to the load. Turbine 5 was brought under load on 22 March.–ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ–∞–≥—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ç ‚Ññ 5 –°–∞—è–Ω–æ-–®—É—à–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ì–≠–° –ø—É—â–µ–Ω –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é —ç–∫—Å–ø–ª—É–∞—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—é —Å –æ–ø–µ—Ä–µ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–∞ On 14 April 2010, the process of dismantling turbine 2 and the infrastructure surrounding it was finished.–ù–∞ –°–∞—è–Ω–æ-–®—É—à–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ì–≠–° –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω –¥–µ–º–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∂ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ–∞–≥—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ç–∞ ‚Ññ2 By the year 2014 all turbines in the plant will be replaced with new ones.

The station's broadcast license was held by Paulino Bernal Evangelism. The station began broadcasting in June 2005 and went dark in May 2009 which led to the cancellation of the station's broadcast license in June 2011. Programming KPBD broadcast a Spanish-language religious radio format to the greater Big Spring-Snyder, Texas, area as a member of the La Nueva Radio Cristiana radio network. History In April 1998, Paulino Bernal Evangelism applied to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. After disputes between multiple applicants for the permit were resolved, the FCC granted this permit on June 3, 2002, with a scheduled expiration date of June 3, 2005. The new station was assigned call sign \\"KPBD\\" on May 24, 2005. After construction and testing were completed in late May 2005, the station was granted its broadcast license on January 26, 2006. The station fell silent for the first time on August 12, 2008. In their August 20, 2008, application for special temporary authority to remain silent, the station's owners cited \\"a malfunction with the equipment\\" for the extended lack of broadcasting. The station briefly resumed broadcasting on May 28, 2009, during an attempt to resolve technical issues but shut down the same day after the station's engineer determined the equipment was \\"not able to maintain operation within licensed parameters\\". In their August 20, 2009, application for a new authority to remain silent, the license holder blamed \\"miscommunication\\" for their failure to notify the FCC of the events of May 2009. The new application was accepted for filing on August 21, 2009, and the original application was dismissed on August 26, 2009. In the application, station owner Paulino Bernal, Jr., stated his belief that repairs could be completed \\"within the next month\\" and regular broadcasting resumed. The station never resumed broadcasting, officially falling dark for the final time on May 28, 2009. Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as a matter of law a radio station's broadcast license is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation if they fail to broadcast for one full year. In June 2011, the FCC notified licensee Paulino Bernal Evangelism that the license for KPBD had expired as a matter of law on May 29, 2010. (The license for \\"K231AL\\", this station's broadcast translator, was declared expired at the same time.) After the KPBD broadcast license was cancelled, the KPBD call sign was deleted from the FCC database on June 7, 2011.

History and present  Former spa buildings with the church tower at the back The very first known written reference to the village (in villa Lybnycze) comes from 1394. Silver was mined in several local adits between 1571 and 1801, but after the mining peak at the end of the 16th century it slowly declined. A spa was built and run here since the 17th century thanks to the local resource of water containing sulphur and iron, and continued for 200 years until the spring died out. The village became independent in 1850, which it has been since with the exception of 1943 - 1945 and 1976‚Äì1990, when it belonged under H≈Øry and Rudolfov respectively. It is possible to get to the village by car after turning off the four-lane E49 road, and there is also bus service. A cycle route leading from Hlubok√° nad Vltavou to Li≈°ov runs through the Libn√≠ƒç, there is a volunteer fire department and a sport club SK Libn√≠ƒç.

Our Lady of Caysasay Academy facade.  History and Status  When the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing founded St. Scholastica's College in Manila in 1906, they had just marked their Silver Anniversary as a religious congregation. In 1885, Pope Leo XIII gave his permission and blessing to the foundation of a Benedictine Missionary Congregation of Fathers and Sisters founded by Reverend Andres Armrhein of Beuron. Seeing the need for Sisters to help in the mission work of the Fathers, Father Armrhein started the Sisters congregation in Reichenbach in 1885, with four young women to spread the faith in other lands. When years later, the sisters had so increased in number that their congregation was made independent from that of the Fathers. The first Mother General elected was Mother M. Birgitta Korff, O.S.B. Within 25 years that the Mother General held her position, the Motherhouse was transferred to Tutzing, Germany. In 1955, the Generalate was transferred to Rome but the convent of Tutzing remained the Motherhouse. During those 25 years, the congregation labored in Africa, in spite of repeated native insurrections which more than once resulted in the martyrdom of the Sisters. It likewise answered urgent needs and requests from the Bishops in Brazil and in the Philippines. In 1906, the first group of Sisters arrived from Tutzing and was welcomed by the Archbishop of Manila into his diocese. Since that time, the Sisters have established schools in most parts of the islands. The Benedictine Sisters as war evacuees came to Taal in 1945 and lived in a borrowed house. The Sisters with Sister Caridad Barrion, OSB, taught piano, Math and other subjects and ran a Kindergarten school. After the war, they were asked to return at the invitation of Bishop Alfredo Verzosa, then Bishop of Lipa to run a school. After much consultation, the Mother Prioress and her councilors decided to accept the offer. Sister Superior Agnella Mayer, OSB, was asked to found the school with the help of Sister Caridad Barrion, OSB, and Sister Liboria Kampinan, OSB. The school was first named St. Martin's Academy. Bishop Versoza who was then staying at St. Bridget's College, wanted the school to be named in honor of the Blessed Mother, Our Lady of Caysasay. Thus, renaming it as Our Lady of Caysasay Academy. The Good Shepherd Sisters of St. Bridget's College delivered the books that were first used. They were also the ones who transported the Benedictine Sisters on April 15, 1945. Rev. Fr. Mariano Lasala, the parish priest of Taal that time was still in the convent which he generously vacated the next day for the use of the Sisters. Cleaning the dilapidated convent and preparing for the opening of an elementary school were the first principal tasks of the pioneers who were later joined by a good number of Sisters. The kindergarten equipment and supplies of the erstwhile St. Scholastica's convent became assets in the old convent. Despite poverty and other difficulties brought about by the war, the Sisters continued to carry on their apostolate. The concerned people of Taal, some of whom were relatives of the Sisters took care and helped the Sisters in times of need. After several years, a high school building was erected under the administration of Sister Hyginia Peralta, OSB. This was later converted into the grade school building when a twelve-room high school building was constructed. A convent was also built for the Sisters who lived there while administering the school. With the student population increasing every year, several annex buildings were built. Through all those years, from OLCA's founding in 1945, the Benedictine Spirit and Motto Ora et Labora served as the inspiration and guide to every child, parent and teacher who entered its portals. When the school celebrated her Silver Anniversary in 1970, she had the first two lay principals in the persons of Ms. Mercedes Anorico (HS 1958) for the grade school and Miss Tita M. Alcazar (HS 1961) for the high school department. The grade school department was co-educational from the start while the high school was exclusive for girls. Starting 1983, boys were accepted in the high school department. The first batch of male graduates numbered only 28. On its 48th year, on April 27, 1993, OLCA took a different course of history. The Benedictine Sisters through Mother Prioress, Sister Pia Lansang, OSB turned over the school to the Archdiocese of Lipa in the presence of Auxiliary Bishop Most Rev. Salvador Q. Quizon, who represented Archbishop Mariano Gaviola. Sister Grace Ancheta, OSS, the Mother Superior of the Oblates of the Holy Spirit, the new community of sisters who teamed up with OLCA's first Priest Director, Rev. Father Carlo Magno C. Ilagan, witnessed the turnover ceremony in a simple paraliturgical service. The Oblates of the Holy Spirit (OSS) assisted the Director from 1993 to 1996. The Community of the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart (MCSH) was invited to assist in the school administration and religious formation in 1996. Sister Mary Regina Conti, MCSH was appointed Assistant Directress.

The gang is also active in Sweden, having established itself in the Malm√∂ district Roseng√•rd and the Stockholm suburbs of Tensta, Rissne and Rinkeby. The Black Cobra gang also control a youth gang called the Black Scorpions. Their criminal activity involves drug trafficking, robbery, theft, racketeering, extortion and murder. The police describe Black Cobra as a loose network composed of strong leadership figures. Black Cobra members wear black and white shirts with an emblem on the back of a cobra in attack position. The shirts also have Black Cobra written on them, above the emblem in Old English- style writing.  History  Copenhagen, Denmark The Black Cobra gang has been considered one of the largest criminal gangs in Denmark since 2000, and their gang members are commonly identified as being immigrants from Turkey, Palestine, Iraq and Albania. The Black Cobra gang currently operate in all Danish cities along with parts of Norway, and in 2009, the gang entered into locations of Sweden, specifically the suburbs Tensta and Rinkeby in Stockholm. The Black Cobra gang has been distinguished as an organised criminal gang rather than a criminal youth group, as the European Forum for Urban Security defines a gang to be a 'durable, street oriented youth group whose involvement in illegal activity is part of its group identity. The Black Cobra gang identify themselves by wearing a black and white shirt with a cobra snake emblem on the front, and they hold ties to a youth gang called The Black Scorpions. The Black Cobra gang follow certain rules and conducts on their actions, and have a system of delegated leadership power, if gang members do not comply with their rules, they risk facing membership expulsion, or a fine. Various factors have been found to contribute towards a member's decision to join the gang, such as socio-economic, schooling, family circumstances and immigration. It has been studied that reasons to join a gang are connected to societal marginalisation and exclusion, and often linked to anti-immigration sentiments. One argument on the cause for an individual joining a gang, is that it is believed that individuals of immigration background face negative scrutiny from society. The Black Cobra gang's recruitment process originally involved public advertising to young males. Within this process, 'higher ranking' gang members would explain reasons as to why new members should join. This public approach concluded after police involvement. A new recruitment strategy was adopted in 2010, which involved new members joining via reference from a current gang member., or recruited through close-knit relationships such as family members, or members of an extended social circle  Notable criminal activity  Rinkeby, Sweden The Black Cobra gang identifies with illegal activity including crimes of drug dealing, violence, burglaries, racketeering and manslaughter. In 2010, it was found that there was an increase in crime of 40% from immigrant youths after they joined a gang. It has been found that gang members are substantially involved in illicit drug sales, as cannabis sales contribute highly to revenue generated by Denmark gangs. Drug use within the gang is largely prevalent as a result of low incomes. The Black Cobra gang's street culture is characterised by violence, drug dealing, and conflict with other gangs, as drug dealing provides the material base for their lifestyle, along with creating a more formally organised operation. The conflict between gangs creates violence. This conflict occurs due to territorial disputes. In 2007, Danish and international analysts saw a rise in gang warfare between traditional Danish gangs such as the Hells Angels, and the new immigrant gang Black Cobra. The gangs fought largely over control of the drug, prostitution, and human trafficking trades. According to Candian reporter Rachel Mendleson, approximately 60 people had died over this gang warfare in Denmark in 2007, and that 1,500 members were involved in gang activities by 2008. In 2013, Sky News reported that Denmark police had arrested 32 bikers and gang members suspected of murder and assault. This was conducted in a massive crackdown on organised crime, as Copenhagen had seen a series of drive by shootings and stabbings throughout 2013. These crimes were suspected by police to be conducted by the Black Cobra gang, Hells Angels and Bandidos biker groups over control in the drug market around the area. In March 2009, members of the Black Cobra were arrested in Malm√∂ for extorting a company for protection money and trafficking illegal drugs. The Black Cobra gang stole 120 boxes of almond tarts, punch rolls, apple crowns and brownies from a delivery truck in southern Sweden in March 2010.  Association and rivalry with other gangs  Danish Hells Angels. The Black Cobra gang has been associated with gangs such as the Black Scorpions and Black Army within Denmark, and have seen to have rivalry with Danish gangs such as the Hells Angels and Bandidos motorcycle gangs, and the Vaerebros. The Black Cobra gang's main rival is the Hells Angels, as in 2007 there was a rise in gang warfare between the two gangs, stemming from conflict over control of the drug and prostitution trade. In 2013, Danish police reported there was 232 shootings, 18 deaths and 198 people were wounded suspected to have begun between the Hells Angels and their youth gang AK81, and Black Cobra, the Bloods and Blagardsplads gangs, all referred to as immigrant gangs. Reasons behind the conflict between Hells Angels and Black Cobra have been linked to anti-immigrant, and racist sentiments towards the Black Cobra, along with control over territory, the drug trade, the prostitution trade, and human trafficking trade. Initial police focus towards gang activity was centred on biker gang related crimes, which allowed for the Black Cobra gang to take over 'markets and territories' which they regularly fought over. In response to the Danish gang conflict, police targeted and incarcerated individuals seen to be leaders and driving forces of these street gangs. Police reported that the crimes committed during gang conflicts typically involves homicide, violence, robbery, narcotics crime, smuggling of goods, intimidation and various forms of financial crime. In 2016, approximately 1,400 people were associated with a gang or motorcycle gang in Denmark alone. A war between the Black Cobra and Bandidos erupted in K√∏ge after Oruc T√ºrkoglu, a leading Black Cobra figure in the city, was stabbed and wounded on 29 January 2013. A few days later, shots were fired at the home of another Black Cobra member southwest of Copenhagen, although no one was injured. In the early hours of 6 February 2013, a prospective Bandidos member was attacked by three Black Cobra members and shot in the knee at his home in Herf√∏lge. Later that day, a tattoo parlor in K√∏ge associated with the Bandidos was riddled with gunfire by two young men on a moped. A fifteen-year-old Black Cobra member was charged with attempted murder after police raided twenty-three properties and recovered two firearms during a crackdown on the gang environment on 28 February 2013.Nu giver de h√•nd: Bandefred i K√∏ge Anne-Marie Madsen and Michael Bo Mortensen, Ekstra Bladet (29 March 2013) A truce was reached and the conflict was brought to an end after four representatives from each gang met on 29 March 2013.Nu er der bandefred i K√∏ge Sune Fischer and Jan S√∏gaard, Ekstra Bladet (29 March 2013) In Sweden, the Black Cobra became involved in a conflict with the Chicanos, a Bandidos support club, after the Chicanos attempted to recruit Black Cobra members. On 5 April 2013, members of both gangs engaged in a riot in Trollh√§ttan.Mc-g√§nget Chicanos Trestad vill v√§xa i v√§st Sandra Divinyi, G√∂teborgs-Tidningen (12 April 2013)  Government and police control  Danish police The Government and police have taken various legislative and policy approaches in attempt to suppress gang activity in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The Norwegian penal law definition of organised crime was implemented in 2003, being that 'a structured association, established over a period of time, of more than two persons acting in concert with a view to committing offences which are punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order'. This law allowed courts to increase penalties towards gangs and organised criminal groups and implement heavier sentencing if a crime is proved to be gang-related. The Danish government attempted to ban outlawed motorcycle groups and gangs in both 1998, and 2010, however both occasions were unsuccessful, as the ban was seen to be unconstitutional due to legal tradition preventing laws related to specific organisations of persons. The Danish police has seen to be the principal driver in preventing gang recruitment, and uncovering gang related financial crimes, such as extortion, tax evasion, social security fraud and the infiltration of legitimate businesses. The most recent policy change in Denmark was implemented in July 2014, a strategy called 'A solid grip on gangs', targeting outlawed motorcycle groups, and local gangs such as the Black Cobra. The new legislation increased penalties for the possession of fire-arms, and allowed courts to double the penalties for specific gang related crimes. The legislation also includes the ability to revoke the parole of gang members who actively participate in ongoing violent conflict, in attempt to prevent gang warfare. The 'solid grip on gangs' strategy also focuses on prevention and desistance programs, as the legislative package introduced several programs allowing police to shut down facilities hosting gang activity, specifically, 'buying out' their properties or denying permission to use a particular property if it is suspected to be used for gang related crimes. In 2009 and 2013, the Denmark Government launched three specific legislative packages, the first one aimed at addressing certain crimes such as street shootings and violent incidents related to gangs and conflict between individual criminal groups. Within this package, it introduced a provision of double penalties, including extended prison sentences in attempt to deter gang membership. The package further includes zone restrictions, being that police can issue a ban on entering and residing in areas with a radius of 500 metres. The government further responded towards the gang activity by introducing the 'Stockholm Gang intervention and Prevention Project in 2009 ‚Äì 2012. This project acts to implement barriers to gang activity in Sweden through gathering information and structuring an operational criminal intelligence unit from the backdrop of what was currently known about street gangs, such as the Black Cobra's recruiting process and rivalry with other gangs. In 2007, the Copenhagen police bureau called for international and Danish analyst focus on the rise in gang warfare, to which they found approximately fourteen gangs were operating in Denmark, and estimated one thousand gang members. In 2019, a news article written by The Guardian reported the actions taken by police on gang control following thirteen explosions in and around Copenhagen since February 2019. The Swedish police conducted stop checks at ferry ports, trains and vehicles in Copenhagen areas, to which National police officer, Lene Frank, commented that it aimed at 'preventing serious and organised crime from spreading', and that 'officers will be focused on cross- border crime, including explosives, weapons, and drugs'. The article further includes that the Swedish government has announced a 34-point plan to combat the gang-related violence, introducing policy measures to make it easier for police to search suspect's homes, and read encrypted phone messages.

He won the Best World/Farsi Editor at the 2004 ODP Autumn Editor Awards. As the Persian ODP managing editor, Bahmanpour was behind a big decision to change the URL of the Persian ODP from Dmoz.org/World/Farsi/ into Dmoz.org/World/Persian/. Believing in the fact that employing Farsi instead of Persian across the English Web is betraying Persian language, during a month-long discussion between him and the ODP meta editors, he persisted on replacing the transliterated word Farsi with the more adequate word Persian, but metas on the other hand precluded the change based on the assumption that URLs have been promoted for years, so it will not be a wise choice to change them. Eventually, in March 2007 the URL was changed.  Unicode contribution  Multilingual software and fonts have always been his main interests.

Early life He was born at Beckenham, Kent. While in his first year at Trinity College, Cambridge, the Second World War began; he volunteered the same day. Royal Air Force service Morison joined the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of war in September 1939, and was trained as a pilot (he already knew how to fly a glider). He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 30 November 1940 and assigned to No. 241 Squadron, flying Westland Lysanders. He was soon transferred to a training unit as an instructor, before joining No. 103 Squadron in May 1942. On the night of 5/6 June 1942, while flying a Wellington bomber on his third mission and the first as captain, he was hit by another Wellington X3339 from 156 Squadron, piloted by Sgt Guy Chamberlin RAFVR. He was the sole survivor of the five-man crew. page 119 Coincidentally, Morison had been Chamberlin's instructor at RAF Lossiemouth around the beginning of 1942.According to David Chamberlin (Guy's Son) following a meeting with Walter Morison and with reference to his service log-book. All the crew of X3339 were killed and are buried in the same row at the Reischwald Forest War Cemetery near Kleve in Germany. He became a prisoner of war (POW) and was sent to Stalag Luft III at Sagan. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 30 November 1942 whilst being held as a POW. On 12 June 1943, Morison and 23 or 25 others escaped from the camp during a delousing break. Twenty-two prisoners left the camp with two \\"guards\\", actually two fellow POWs in bogus German uniforms. Once outside, the group split up. The others were quickly recaptured, but he and Flight Lieutenant Lorne Welch, wearing fake uniforms, walked to a nearby airfield and attempted to steal an aircraft, a Junkers W 34. They had to abandon the attempt when the rightful crew appeared to fly away the aircraft. The next day, they returned and tried to steal a biplane, but were caught and eventually sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz. He was liberated from Colditz by the American army in April 1945. Post-war Following the war, Morison qualified as a chartered accountant at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales. He was articled at Morison, a firm established by his great uncle. Morison then worked at Coopers Bros, the firm that became Coopers & Lybrand, before returning to his family firm, Morison Stoneham. He led the firm as a senior partner through a period of great change from 1960 to 1981 before retiring.

It is a Catholic hospital member of the Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System (FMOLHS). The hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission and it serves as a teaching hospital to Our Lady of the Lake College, Louisiana State University, Tulane University and Southern University. OLOLRMC is the dominant institution in health care in the Greater Baton Rouge area and the largest private medical center in Louisiana, with over 800 beds. In a given year, OLOLRMC treats approximately 25,000 patients in the hospital, and services about 350,000 persons through outpatient locations. It has a complement of almost 900 physicians and 3,000 staff members. The Lake also operates two nursing homes, has an affiliated cancer facility adjacent to the main hospital, and operates a number of outpatient services on its campus as well as in outlying locations. History In 1911, Mother de Bethanie Crowley and five Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady traveled to America to serve the sick and needy.https://fmolhs.org/ololrmc/Pages/About-Us/History.aspx Eight years after establishing a hospital in Monroe, Louisiana, Mother de Bethanie was invited to Baton Rouge by Monsignor Francis Leon Gassler of St. Joseph's Cathedral and a group of leading local physicians, to tour the downtown area in search of a suitable location for a hospital to serve the 22,000 residents of the small river town. Mother de Bethanie insisted on a patch across University Lake from the original Louisiana State University campus. In November 1923, the four-story brick structure of Our Lady of the Lake Sanitarium opened its doors to the city. In April 1978, the original hospital was closed and a 460-bed facility on Essen Lane opened to better serve a population that had grown to the south and east of the original location. Throughout the years, the facilities have undergone expansion. There are current plans to build a free-standing Children's Hospital in a nearby area. OLOLRMC is the only Catholic-sponsored hospital in Greater Baton Rouge area and the oldest unbroken ownership and affiliation of any area hospital (since 1923). It is aligned with three FMOLHS sister hospitals across Louisiana (Our Lady of Lourdes in Lafayette; St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe; St. Elizabeth Hospital in Gonzales). Children‚Äôs Hospital OLOL Children's Hospital is a hospital within a hospital that has 90 inpatient pediatric beds, including 60 medical/surgical, 14 Level 1 PICU beds and 10 Hematology/Oncology unit. It has in excess of 6,300 discharges annually and is rapidly becoming the largest pediatric provider in Louisiana. This is the only 24/7 pediatric emergency department in the Baton Rouge area. OLOLRMC also has the only Certified Child Life Specialists department and Pediatric Sedation Service in the area. It has more than 150 Pediatricians and Family Practice doctors on staff. OLOLRMC is affiliated to Woman's Hospital for newborn and neonatal care. Pediatric Hematology-Oncology service is a St. Jude Children's Hospital affiliate. Since 2010, OLOLRMC is also home to the only pediatric residency program in the Baton Rouge area. In late 2019, Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital opened its doors as only the second free-standing children's hospital in Louisiana. This $230 million project began in 2016 and was supposed to be completed in late 2018. Due to fundraising delays. On this new hospital's campus, there will be a medical office building, which will bring many doctors of different specialties under the same roof. The new children's hospital has six floors, and has its own emergency room. Every floor is said to have its own playroom, since the entire hospital is dedicated to children. Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is going to continue its partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and offer hematology/oncology services and chemotherapy within its hospital for St. Jude patients. Although this is a stand-alone hospital from its parent hospital, it will still only have 80 patient beds when it first opens up. However, the contractors on this job have left room for improvement, by possibly adding a seventh and eighth floor which would raise the number of beds within the hospital. The number of beds are sometimes irrelevant, since many patients will be coming in for outpatient procedures. Services OLOLRMC Cancer Center is Baton Rouge area's only peripheral blood stem cell transplantation program, and only high-dose Interleukin II chemotherapy treatment center in Louisiana. In regards to oncology, OLOLRMC also provides access to clinical trials. Overall, more open- heart procedures than any other hospital in Louisiana are done at OLOLRMC. Likewise, more joint procedures than any other Louisiana hospital. It is the only hospital in Louisiana with a Nuclear Medicine department accredited by ICANL (Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Nuclear Medicine Laboratories). The hospital also manages a blood-doning service. OLOLRMC was the first hospital in the world to use an integrated radiology information system (RIS) and PACS to achieve a completely filmless environment.

Service history  World War II Following shakedown training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, William M. Hobby proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia. From 16 May 1945 to 21 May 1945, she conducted an \\"amphibious shakedown,\\" including shore bombardment exercises off Bloodsworth Island in Chesapeake Bay. After post-shakedown repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, William M. Hobby held additional shakedown gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay before she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 June 1945, bound for the Panama Canal Zone in company with her sister ship, the high-speed transport USS Amesbury (APD-46). William M. Hobby reached Crist√≥bal, Panama Canal Zone, on 8 June 1945, completed the transit of the Panama Canal on 10 June 1945, and set course for the California coast immediately thereafter. Arriving at San Diego, California on 17 June 1945, she got underway for the Hawaiian Islands in company with Amesbury and destroyer escort USS O'Reilly (DE-330) on 20 June 1945. Arriving at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 27 June 1945, William M. Hobby trained underwater demolition teams at Ma'alaea Bay, Maui, Territory of Hawaii, in July before she embarked Underwater Demolition Team 29 for transportation to the United States West Coast. Departing the Hawaiian Islands on 2 August 1945, William M. Hobby made port at Oceanside, California, on 9 August 1945. Shifting briefly to San Pedro, California, William M. Hobby returned to Oceanside and disembarked Underwater Demolition Team 29 on 13 August 1945. The following day, 14 August 1945 ‚Äì 15 August 1945 across the International Date Line in East Asia -- Japan surrendered, ending World War II. Postwar On 16 August 1945, William M. Hobby got underway for Hawaii. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 22 August 1945, she got underway on 24 August 1945 for the Marshall Islands, in company with high-speed transports USS Ira Jeffrey (APD-44) and USS Blessman (APD-48), and arrived at Eniwetok on 1 September 1945. Pushing on to the Philippines, she anchored in Manila Bay on 5 September 1945. William M. Hobby cruised in the Philippine Islands‚Äîtouching at Subic Bay, Zamboanga, Mindanao, Bugo, Macajalar Bay, and San Pedro Bay‚Äîuntil she departed for Okinawa, and from thence to Japan. Reaching Wakayama, Japan, on 28 September 1945, William M. Hobby soon got underway for Hiro Wan, Honshu, with Underwater Demolition Team 5 embarked. Daybreak on 1 October 1945 found her entering the Inland Sea. There, she joined destroyer minelayer USS Tracy (DM-19), which led William M. Hobby to her anchorage at Hiro Wan. That morning, William M. Hobby sighted a floating naval mine off her port bow and destroyed it with 40-millimeter, 20-millimeter, and rifle fire. William M. Hobbys embarked underwater demolition team reconnoitered beaches and shore installations at Hiro Wan from 2 October 1945 to 10 October 1945 to prepare the way for the arrival of American occupation troops in the Kure area. On 11 October 1945, William M. Hobby got underway for the island of Shikoku and arrived at the port of Mitsuhama later that day. She disembarked the 15 United States Army officers, 18 enlisted men, and two Japanese officers whom she had carried as passengers and remained at anchor off Mitsuhama while Underwater Demolition Team 5 reconnoitered the beaches there. After returning once more to Hiro Wan, William M. Hobby got underway for the United States on 14 October 1945. Proceeding via Guam, Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the Panama Canal, she arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 December 1945. She subsequently shifted southward via Norfolk to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she arrived on 6 January 1946. Decommissioning and disposal William M. Hobby was decommissioned at Green Cove Springs on 6 April 1946 and placed in reserve there. She remained in reserve until she was stricken from the Navy List on 1 May 1967. Republic of Korea Navy service Transferred to the government of South Korea on a grant-in-aid on 23 July 1967, William M. Hobby was reclassified in Republic of Korea Navy service as a gunboat and renamed ROKS Chr Ju (PG-87).

The tombs are also known as Cubbas (the Sindhi word for tombs). These tombs are located in Hirabad, Hyderabad in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The tombs complex hosts large mausoleums for Talpur rulers while they are several smaller mausoleums for their wives, consorts and infant children. There are several graves in the external area that are uncovered and unmarked, apart from a few exceptions. The graves are mostly made out of marble and usually have Quranic verses inscribed on their surfaces. Once a magnificent burial ground for the Talpur rulers, this place now has several preservation concerns. As of 30 March 2011, the Culture Department, Government of Sindh retained the charge for these monuments, following a devolution of the government to provinces. Since then, there has been slow and steady restoration work on preserving these monuments.  Architecture  Photograph of the tombs complex (c. 1900) The architecture patterns of the tombs in the complex are reminiscent of various Talpur structures, however most of the tombs in this complex are either square or rectangular in shape. These structures follow almost the same specifications as that of the mausoleum of Mir Fateh Ali Khan at New Khudabad. The largest domed structure contains two graves, those of, Mir Karam Ali Khan (d. 1828) and Mir Murad Ali Khan (d. 1833). Behind this building is a smaller building which contains the graves of Mir Karam‚Äôs two wives, the wife of Mir Abdullah Khan and an infant. To the north of these structures is one containing the graves of Talpur rulers, Mir Nur Muhammad Khan, Mir Nasir Khan, Mir Shahdad Khan and Mir Hussain Ali Khan. It is said that the rulers designed their own burial places while alive. The building in front of the last on the east, contains the remains of the wife and child of Mir Nur Muhammad Khan and the wife of Mir Husayn Ali Khan. Other wives of two of these rulers and three young children, repose in the small tomb in the north-west corner. Other Mirs lie within the two small tombs at the southwest corner of Mir Karam Ali Khan‚Äôs mausoleum and the remaining buildings contain the bodies of wives, daughters and children of some of these. In the southern group of tombs, two principal mausoleums that are nearest the entrance on the east and immediately behind it, contain the graves of four Mirs, while the rest are occupied by their wives and children.  Vaulted structures  Interior of one of the tombs The ladies‚Äô mausoleums are peculiar in the sense that they appear to look like vaulted wagon structures. One such mausoleum is rectangular in plan and surmounted by two domes, flanked by kicks on each of its four corners. The fa√ßade containing the entrance door is divided into three arched panels on each side. On the top of each arched panel, there is a rectangular panel covered with tiles in floral patterns. The other sides of the mausoleum contain more or less the same arched panelling and similar decorative colour scheme.  Decorative art  These tombs are renowned for the tile decoration on their outside fa√ßade. The tiles are placed in multiple colours which primarily include blue floral patterns over white background. Some accents of green, yellow and brown are placed in a manner so as to break the monotonous decorative look.  Burial traditions  In typical Talpur fashion, the marble graves have the actual royal turbans of these rulers placed upon a projection at the end of each. The graves are etched with Quranic verses in Arabic, whilst some of the walls inside the mausoleums are decorated with poetry in Persian. Apart from the Arabic inscriptions on the graves, they are largely unmarked and have no names to denote their occupants. The graves are usually covered in marble masonry work.  Purdah for females  The mausoleums of female Talpurs are designed to be closed structures. These are distinctly vaulted structures with jaalis on the door archways to show the dead buried within still observing purdah, as they would‚Äôve in life. To this day, it is forbidden for men to step inside these mausoleums.  Preservation  The visitor is greeted by a board erected by the Department of Archaeology, Government of Pakistan which has since been appropriately modified after the government was devolved to the province. Once a magnificent burial ground for the Talpur rulers, this place now has several preservation concerns. Under the management of the Department of Archaeology, Government of Pakistan, the mausoleums fell into disrepair. As of 30 March 2011, the Culture Department, Government of Sindh retained the charge for these monuments, following a devolution of the government to provinces. The tomb complex is now enclosed in a walled area in order to put a halt to the encroaching residential buildings surrounding the site. Many of the crumbling tombs were ‚Äúused by drug addicts and drifters for resting the night‚Äù whilst ‚Äúlocal youngsters to play cricket during the day‚Äù in wide open spaces around the mausoleums.  Restoration and maintenance  Lately, there have been efforts to restore the tombs of ancient rulers elsewhere, including some of former Talpur rulers. The restoration began in April 2012 and was led by Ishtiaq Ansari. Where there are restoration works actively in progress elsewhere, the site, that is the subject of this article, has since been neglected. The newly devolved Sindh government nevertheless shows a willingness to work towards improving these monuments and ‚Äúmak[ing] right [the wrongs of] the past 63 years‚Äù under the former management.

He has been cited as a pioneer collector of industrial folklore, and according to Michael Taft of the Library of Congress, \\"may very well be considered the father of occupational folklore studies in the United States.\\" In addition to writing and editing a number of influential books, he also issued his field recordings of coal miners on two LP records for the Library of Congress.Profile, loc.gov; accessed January 19, 2014. The first of six children, Korson was brought by his parents Joseph and Rose from Bobrynets , Ukraine to the United States in 1906 when he was seven years old. After a brief time in Brooklyn, New York, the family relocated to the coal-mining city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, when George was thirteen years old. Involved with his high school newspaper, he landed a job after high school as a reporter for the Wilkes-Barre Record. He briefly attended Columbia University to pursue studies in English and history in 1921-1922, but was forced to return home by his family's financial difficulties. Upon his return he joined the staff of the Pottsville Republican. Assigned to cover miners and their families in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, he began collecting songs and stories from them for special features and educated himself in folklore and folk song studies of the period and region. The collection was unprecedented because folklorists previously had concentrated mostly on rural Anglo-American balladry of mountaineers, cowboys, and lumbermen. His collection drew attention for showing emergent folklore of industrial life, labor movements, and immigrant traditions in a mixed-ethnic social context. In 1927, he issued his collections in book form as Songs and Ballads of the Anthracite Miner, followed by publications that included narrative and customary traditions of coal miners, such as Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch (1960, winner of the Chicago Folklore Prize in that year), Coal Dust on the Fiddle: Songs and Stories of the Bituminous Industry (1943), and his essay on \\"coal miners' for Pennsylvania Songs and Legends (1949), which he edited. In 1936, he became director of the Pennsylvania Folk Festival, and he served three terms as president of the Pennsylvania Folklore Society. Korson received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957 to work on Black Rock, and garnered more national recognition for his folklore work with induction in 1960 into the American Folklore Society's honorary circle of Fellows. During the 1950s, Korson worked for the UMWA and the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. and travelled to Pennsylvania to add to his field collections in song and story. In 1965 he donated his collection of papers and recordings to the D. Leonard Corgan Library at King's College in Wilkes-Barre. In 2004, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress announced the transfer of the collection to the Library. His field trips into the coal region were undertaken despite his battles with heart disease for much of his later life. Korson died on May 23, 1967 in New Jersey, aged 67, after suffering his seventh heart attack. Books Korson, George. 1927. Songs and Ballads of the Anthracite Miners. New York: Frederick H.

Built for distant cruising in the heyday of the British Empire, the vessel served as a warship and training vessel until 1922, when it was sold. Originally classified as a screw corvette,A screw corvette was a propeller-driven small cruiser. Calypso was also one of the Royal Navy‚Äôs last sailing corvettes but supplemented an extensive sail rig with a powerful engine. Among the first of the smaller cruisers to be given steel hulls instead of iron, the hull nevertheless was cased with timber and coppered below the water line, as were wooden ships.Archibald (1971), p. 43. Unlike , the more famous member of ths class, Calypso had a quiet career, consisting mainly of training cruises in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1902 the warship was sent to the colony of Newfoundland and served as a training ship for the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve before and during the First World War. In 1922 Calypso was declared surplus and sold, then used as a storage hulk. Her hull still exists, awash in the Bay of Exploits off Newfoundland. Design Calypso and Calliope comprised the Calypso class of corvettes, designed by Nathaniel Barnaby. Part of a long line of cruiser classes built for protecting trade routes and colonial police work,Lyon (1980), pp. 21‚Äì22, 35‚Äì40. they were the last two sailing corvettes built for the Royal Navy. Corvettes had been built of iron since the of 1867, but the Calypsos and the preceding used of steel. Corvettes were designed to operate across the vast distances of Britain's maritime empire, and could not rely on dry docks for maintenance. Since iron (and steel) hulls were subject to biofouling and could not easily be cleaned, the established practice of copper sheathing was extended to protect them; the metal plating of the hull was timber-cased and coppered below the waterline. Under full sail (1898) The Calypsos differed from the ships of the preceding Comus class in armament, including new 6-inch rifles in place of the 7-inch muzzleloaders and 64-pounders that originally armed the first ships of the parent class. Although similar in general appearance to their predecessors, the Calypsos had guns sponsoned out both fore and aft and had no gunports under the quarterdeck and foredeck. They were also slightly longer, had a deeper draught, and displaced 390 tons more.Archibald (1971), p. 49. Calypsos engine produced were of 4,023 indicated horsepower, over 50 percent more powerful than those of its nine half-sisters, which yielded one more knot of speed. This compound-expansion engine could drive Calypso at 13¬æ knots, or 14¬æ knots with forced draught. The vessel nevertheless carried a barque rig of sail on three masts,Published sources state the class had barque rigs, Paine (2000), vol. 799, p. 29, which is shown in some images. Other drawings and photographs show a ship rig, with yards and square sails on the mizzenmast. Archibald (1970), p. 49; J.S. Virtue & Co., lithograph of HMS \\"Calliope\\", 3rd Class Cruiser See Commons images and photographs linked below. including a full set of studding sails on fore and mainmast.Harland, John H. (1985), Seamanship in the Age of Sail, p. 172. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis. . This rig enabled the corvette to serve in areas where coaling stations were rare, and to rely entirely on sails for propulsion. The class therefore was well-suited to its designed role: trade protection and distant cruising service for the British Empire at its Victorian peak.Navy Historical Center, HMS Calliope (1884-1951). Service with the fleet While the class was designed for long-range protection of the trade routes of the empire,Paine (2000), p. 29. and Calypso participated in war games, much of its career was spent in activities appropriate to an empire at peace. The ship served in home waters, and participated in fleet exercises, including a simulated attack on Britain,Tryon's Brilliant Tactics, The New York Times (2 July 1893), p. 16. and visited Kiel,Dodd, Francis (1917), Admirals of the British Navy (1917‚Äì1918), Chapter X. site of a major base of the Imperial German Navy often visited by British vessels. In 1890, Britain gave up the isle of Heligoland in the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, and Calypso was assigned to carry out the ceremony of transfer to the German Empire and bring back the island's last British governor.Hertslet, Edward (1891), The Map of Europe by Treaty, vol. IV, pp. 3288‚Äì89. Harrison and Sons, for HM Stationery Office. HMS Calypso in 1897, by W L Wyllie From the time of first commission in 1885 until was placed in reserve in 1898, Calypso was part of the Sail Training Squadron, the \\"last refuge of the sailing navy\\" apart from a handful of smaller vessels.Osbon (1964), p. 207.Archibald (1971), p. 42. The warship made cruises to the West Indies,Hansard, House of Commons Debate, 24 May 1886, vol. 35 cc 1834‚Äì35 (question to Secretary to the Admiralty on breakdown of machinery while with training squadron on cruise to West Indies) the Canary Islands, and Norway.Papers of Vice Admiral A C Scott, Archives, Imperial War Museum. In 1895 Calypso was part of the squadron which conducted surveys well above the Arctic Circle, and a landfall and cluster of buildings on Svalbard, Norway, now a cultural heritage site, were named in honour of its visits to those waters.Johansen, Bj√∏rn Fossli (ed.); Henriksen, J√∏rn; Overreinand, √òystein; and Prestvold, Kristin; Calypsobyen, Cruise Handbook for Svalbard, Norwegian Polar Institute (May 2009). The site lies within South Spitsbergen National Park. On other occasions it assisted in the salvage of a civilian ship, for which its officers and crew were awarded salvage money,The London Gazette, 6 October 1891, p. 5231 and 11 December 1891, p. 6846. and passed on hydrographic information from waters near Iceland.The London Gazette, 4 Sept 1896, p. 4991. On 26 June 1897 Calypso was present at the Review of the Fleet off Spithead held to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne.The London Gazette Extraordinary, 14 March 1898, pp. 1616, 1621. Paid off into reserve at Devonport in 1898, it was no longer considered a fighting ship by the turn of the century, and it was felt it could best be employed in training naval reservists for service at sea.Hunter, p. 39. Training ship Wharfside at St. Johns. The shedlike structure behind the reservists is a drill hall erected atop Calypso's gunwale. Boat davits are shown on port side of vessel (upper left) and at stern (far right); the aft port gun is sponsoned out from the hull (right of top rows of sailors). On 3 September 1902 Calypso was placed back into commission under the command of Commander Frederick Murray Walker, and was sent across the Atlantic to become a training ship for the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), which trained men for service in the Royal Navy.\\"Newfoundland\\", entry in Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events (1902), Volume 6, p. 384. The Reserve had been founded in 1900 as an experiment to assist the Admiralty in the manning of ships, and to enable the Newfoundlanders to assist in the defence of the empire, training their seafarers in the winter months when the fishery was not worked.Hunter, p. 36. As the result of this trial, the Admiralty agreed to provide a vessel, and the colony agreed to pay for the refit, as well as an annual subvention to support the training programme. The location of the vessel was controversial, with the community of Argentia proferred as a substitute for the colonial capital of St. John's. Reasons for this proposal included both a desire to protect the larger city from the conjectured debaucheries of sailors, and to protect the reservists, many of whom were married, from the temptations (including prostitution) which might be available in the city.Hunter, passim. In a time of tensions between Britain and France, Argentia also had the benefit of being closer to the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and it was felt beneficial to have a British military force in proximity to the French territory in the event of a dispute.Hunter, p. 41. The discussion on location took place only a few years after the Fashoda Incident in 1898 when the two nations came close to war, before Imperial Germany supplanted France as Britain's principal rival and before the Anglo-French Entente of 1904, which resolved colonial difficulties. These objections were felt to be outweighed by cost, convenience, and accessibility of staff to the colonial government, and St. John's was chosen to host the ship. Calypso arrived at St. John's on 15 October. The vessel was hulked;Hunter, pp. 39, 44‚Äì45. the masts were removed, as was the funnel from the boilers, and a drill hall was erected on the weather deck. Without sail or working boilers the vessel could no longer go to sea and was permanently moored wharfside at the western end of the St. John's harbour.Hunter, pp. 39, 44‚Äì45. Prior to the outbreak of war candidates had to be fishermen or sailors, and the RNR maintained a reserve strength of 500‚Äì600 men.Hillier. By 1914, over 1,400 seamen had been trained, and more than 400 answered the call to arms on the outbreak of the Great War.Parsons, p. 147. The Reserve provided crew for ships of the Royal Navy, including over 100 seamen taken aboard a month after the start of the war, the first group of Newfoundlanders to go to war. It also provided home defence, including manning coast artillery at the entrance to the St. Johns harbour,Maple Leaf, p.10 . and the protection of Newfoundland's shore and shipping.HMS Calypso fonds. Calypso and a small, slow armed patrol vessel were the colony's only warships,Jane, p. 100. and Calypso could not go to sea. In 1916, Calypso was renamed HMS Briton, and the former name was given to a new light cruiser laid down in that year, which entered service in 1917.Jane, p. 57. Before the war the owner of the dock where Calypso was berthed had sought the vessel's removal. The matter was held in abeyance during the war years, but after the conclusion of hostilities the subject arose anew. Relocation would have been a significant expense to the Admiralty, and the Colonial Office was informed that the dominion would accept complete withdrawal of the vessel. By 1922 naval estimates were being slashed and the Washington Naval Treaty limited the size of fleets.Hunter, pp. 47‚Äì52. The Admiralty therefore summarily discontinued the Newfoundland RNR, and there being no further need of the ship, Briton was made available for disposition.Hadley, p. 255.

Some thought was given to preservation, but in 1968 it was towed to a coastal bay near Embree, and burned to the waterline.Lewisporte. The hull still is there, awash in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.More precisely, the hull lies in Jobs Cove, off Burnt Bay (an arm of Notre Dame Bay) on the north coast of Newfoundland. Calypso is the larger and northly of the two hulls shown. An image is here (the hull on the left is that of Calypso).

A 12lb deck guns was removed in 1965 and taken to the Royal Canadian Legion Branch #12 in Grand Falls, NL and was positioned on the front of the Legion building. A 12lb shell that was removed from that same gun in 1965 as well as a 5\\" shell from Calypso was turned over to the RCMP for disposal as it has been suspected to still be live. Those two shells from the Calypso sat on a shelf in the Branch 12 Military Museum for over 35 years in plain view and accessible to everyone. (From the Historical Committee, Royal Canadian Legion, Grand Falls Branch #12, NL) These remnants are not the sole remaining legacy. Calypso, created as a ship of war, has given its name another training institution, but one with peaceful purposes.

With the establishment of the George Cross in 1940, the Albert Medal was discontinued. Early life Robin Hoare was born the son of Charles Arthur Richard Hoare, Senior Partner of C.

He then emigrated to New Zealand where he stayed for several years before working his passage home via Valpara√≠so where he collected some polo ponies for delivery to the United Kingdom. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he was commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 7 October 1914, initially for service in the Royal Naval Division.Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve: Records of Service, WW1‚ÄîImage details‚ÄîHoare, Keith Robin, DocumentsOnline, The National Archives (fee usually required to view full pdf of original service record).

In 1917 and early 1918 he made several applications for transfer to the submarine service or to larger craft: these were all refused. He was promoted to acting lieutenant commander on 25 February 1918, and on 6 April 1918, Hoare was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his service in the Patrol during the course of the previous year. On 12 April 1918, the engine room of HM Motor Launch 356 exploded at Dunkirk quay, after a collision with another vessel, and the forward petrol tanks burst into flames.Staunton, Anthony (2005). Victoria Cross: Australia's Finest and the Battles they Fought. Prahran, Victoria, Australia: Hardie Grant Books. . Page 298 Several of the launch's crew were blown overboard by the explosion, while the remainder were driven off by the fire. Flames soon began to issue forth from the cabin, and burning petrol spread on the surface of the water. As others proceeded to flee the scene, Hoare, along with Lieutenant Arthur Bagot, realised the fire was threatening the aft petrol tanks and the depth charges located on board the launch. Jumping in a dinghy, the pair rowed out towards the blaze. On reaching the wreck, Hoare and Bagot removed the depth charges despite the flames; thus preventing any further explosion. For their actions during the incident, both Hoare and Bagot were awarded the Albert Medal. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in the London Gazette on 20 August 1918, reading: Appointed Commander of Motor Launch 283, Hoare was in action at the First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918. Throughout the operation, the launch conducted duties of rescuing officers and men from HMS Sirius and HMS Brilliant. Praised for \\"exercising the utmost coolness and judgement\\" during the engagement, Hoare was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation records that he went alongside HMS Sirius under heavy fire and took off 50 of her crew and then went alongside HMS Brilliant and took off 16 of that ship's crew. The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 23 July 1918. His acting rank was also confirmed as a further reward for his success in this operation. He was invested with his DSO and DSC by King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 31 July 1918.

Hotel consolidators‚Äô seemingly to brokers buy in bulk and then resell at a predetermined discount thus creating a big push search for discounted hotel deals online and passing the savings on to their customers. Global hotel consolidators usually offer discounted rooms in almost every major tourist destination, big city or popular resort while local consolidators focus only on a particular geographic area trying to be most competitive on a key for the company market. Hotel consolidator‚Äôs activity can be separated into two main operations: 1) Buying blocks of rooms at volume discounts in certain major cities 2) Distributing ‚Äúexcess rooms‚Äù offered by hotels not anticipating full occupancy for given dates. The strength in numbers In comparison to individuals who contact hotels directly and ask for discounts, the consolidators are able to achieve deep discounts due to their buying power. Hotels are willing to offer dramatically reduced room rates to consolidators because they know it will yield a greater number of reservations. Many hotels are interested in selling room blocks (allotments) to consolidators, because they know that discounted rooms mean more business in the long run and subsequently a greater profit for them.  Final Client benefits When booking through a hotel consolidator or from hotel consolidator‚Äôs retailer you can either get the least appealing room in the hotel, or you can get a surprising free upgrade to a higher class room if all other standard rooms have been sold out. The key advantage of booking a hotel room through a hotel consolidator is that just one call or just one website visit can get you a room at a 20 to 35% discounted price. The key disadvantage is that prices are not negotiable and the cancellation and amendment charges can be pretty harsh. Additional benefit of hotel consolidators is that they have rooms available when all other hotels are sold out during conventions and trade fairs.

It was written by Russell T Davies and set in a grand hotel in Manchester in the 1920s. There are two series: eight episodes in the first series were broadcast from 4 April 1997 to 23 May 1997 and ten in the second series from 30 January 1998 to 3 April 1998. All 18 episodes were written by Russell T Davies. The cast included Susan Hampshire, Julia St. John, Tim Healy, Michael Siberry, Stephen Moyer and Mark McGann. The two series were novelised by Catrin Collier, under the pen name Katherine Hardy. Characters The series featured the Bannerman family that owned and ran the hotel, the staff that lived in the basement and occasional guests. At the series opening, the very upright John Bannerman (Michael Siberry) has just reopened the Grand, which he inherited from his overbearing father and which he now owns and operates with his staid and steady wife, Sarah (Julia St. John). On opening night of the new, refurbished Grand, their son, Stephen (Stephen Moyer in the first series, Ifan Meredith in the second) returns from service in World War I. Initially a happy occasion, it soon becomes apparent that Stephen is a damaged young man who hides his pain in alcohol. Their daughter, Adele (Camilla Power), a young teenager, feels ignored and finds more in common with the staff than she does her own family. After an unfortunate series of events puts the Grand in financial jeopardy, John's younger brother, Marcus (Mark McGann), a very intelligent but seemingly heartless businessman with shady connections to the underworld, offers to save the day by becoming a partner in the hotel‚Äîbut are his motivations genuine, or does he have an ulterior motive? Also featured are John's stuffy mother, Mary, and Marcus' \\"lady friend,\\" the beautiful Ruth Manning (Amanda Mealing in the first series, Victoria Scarborough in the second) who appears to be every bit Marcus' equal when it comes to cold- hearted calculation. Jacob Collins (Tim Healy) is the all-seeing hall porter, seemingly in total control, yet plagued by demons of his own. Mrs Harvey (Christine Mackie) is the housekeeper who rules over the chambermaids with the iron hand of a prison guard. The most level headed of the chambermaids is the lovely Kate Morris (Rebecca Callard), who fights to convince herself and others that everyone has their place. Another chambermaid, the lively, likable, but unsatisfied and eternally in trouble Monica Jones (Jane Danson) is Kate's polar opposite. Lynn Milligan, Brenda Potter, Monica Jones play the other chambermaids. The ready-steady footman/bartender is Clive (Paul Warriner). Guests that featured in the series were Miss Esme Harkness (Susan Hampshire), a madame and semi-retired prostitute, who takes Monica under her wing; James Cornell (Daniel Casey); Maggie Rigby (Lucy Davis); a troublemaking school friend of Adele's, and her father, Lawrence, John Middleton.

Sometimes the digital barrier increases with the number of years since the trade began. All of the options are active from the start of the trade.  Example  A three-year Commodore Option with annual barriers would have three potential payoffs. The first would pay at the end of the first year and would be dependent on the pre-determined barrier being reached or exceeded. For example, if the Underlying or Basket of Underlyings reached or exceeded 102% of its initial level at the end of year one, a coupon of 6% would be paid. At the end of year two, if the Underlying reached or exceeded 104% of its initial level, another 6% coupon would be paid. The coupon in the final year would be 6% if the Underlying reached or exceeded 106%. The coupon should exceed the performance level of the Underlying, otherwise the investor would achieve the same result by investing directly in the Underlying. The name comes from the original Commodore option that was linked to the performance of a leading UK Stock Index. The coupons were 6% per annum and the barriers were 102% on the initial level of the index at the end of year 1 increasing by 2% per annum for years 2, 3 and 4.

Over the course of the show, Dad (aka Mega Nanny), must complete a series of comedy challenges with the help of Mum and Dave Chapman. For example, in the first challenge '..And a Sausage Roll', he must make a phone call to a shop, as a lady, and order various bizarre things, including a Sausage Roll. In 'Where's Your Wig At?', he must enter the house without his wig on, and rescue it, without the kids spotting him. Each secret challenge, if successfully completed, wins the kids a family day out. During the two days, he will also find out what the kids think of their home lives and how they'd like to change Dad (EG play with them more, not watch telly or talk about soccer all the time). Often the dads are quite shocked at what their kids say. At the end of the two days, Mega Nanny's true identity is revealed, and Dad will face one final challenge, a quiz to prove that over the two days, he has got to know the kids better. If he passes, he'll get to join them on those family prizes - if he fails, he has to help them with their homework for a month. Production and showtimes The show was produced in the UK by Tiger Aspect Productions and airs Sundays 9am on BBC2, with repeats on Saturdays 5:15pm on CBBC.

It is recently discovered and still under research. Its main structures are found on the right bank of Llullan river, West flank of the Cordillera Blanca, 1 km north from the city of Caraz, at an elevation of 2300m above sea level. Recent investigations propose the site belongs to the Late Pre Ceramic (around 2000 BCE), even when upper sediments shows evidences of a later occupations (Mid Early Huaylas Culture), around 300 BCE - 300 CE. The fine stone works forms a circular structure, consisting on platforms, terraces and stairways. The most outstanding product from this culture are the stone head (cabezas clavas) and triangular stones, which clearly tells about an early Chavin civilization. [1] The earliest structures were built, accordingly with chronology, between La Galgada (3,000 - 2,000 b.C) and Chavin (1,200 - 300 BC). The artistic production recalls a lot of those found at the Moxeke complex, on Casma Valley. Around 1873, the Italian explorer Antonio Raimondi described the place as a \\"hill\\", partially destroyed, built with huge stone walls. In 1919, Dr. Julio C. Tello confirms this description by writing that the structure includes platforms and terraces forming inside aisles and stairways. By 1990 some work was performed, removing debris and waste. Importance Accordingly, with the general outline of the buildings, it seems to be a huge monumental center. Etymology Tumshu = Core, center, Kayko = We are. So we could say the meaning is: \\"We are the Center\\" Site description The Tumshukayko culture was set 1 km north from the present-day city of Caraz, and seemed to be a center for those people living in the surrounding areas. The monument is a massive flat-topped circular structure, surrounded by lower semi-circular walls, separated from each other about 2,40m, and this empty space was filled with loose rocks and earth. The outside walls are decorated with geometrical sculptures and carvings. The structure extends approximately 300m in diameter and 25m in elevation.

Lelo or lelo burti (), literally a \\"field ball [playing]\\", is a Georgian folk sport, which is a full contact ball game, and very similar to rugby.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p67 Within Georgian rugby union terminology, the word lelo is used to mean a try, and the popularity of rugby union in Georgia has also been attributed to it.Louis, p39 In 2014, lelo burti, along with khridoli, a traditional martial art, was inscribed by the government of Georgia as a \\"nonmaterial monument\\" of culture. It appears in the 12th century Georgian epic poem The Knight in the Panther's Skin in which the characters play lelo burti. Traditional varieties Lelo was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (\\"Lelo\\") would be selected and :\\"In earlier times, the lelo teams would consist of a few dozen players each, and the field would sometimes have to be crossed by a stream, which the players would have to ford in pursuit of the ball.\\"Lukashin, p24 Sometimes the playing field was between two water courses. The two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighbouring villages, would face each other. The number of players from each side was not set traditionally, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river to the \\"half\\" of the opposing side. :\\"The game took place over a wide area sometimes stretching for several kilometres on very rough ground. The contestants would have to contend with spurs, hills, valleys, woods. cascading streams and marshes. Their task was to get a ball into a certain place, say, over the settlement boundary or to the foot of the mountain. Any means necessary could be employed to drive the ball forward ‚Äî feet or hands. Sometimes they would play the game on horseback.\\" It was believed that the winning team would secure a better harvest for their village. Standardised version During the Soviet Period, lelo became standardised: :\\"Nowadays lelo is played according to strictly defined rules on a proper pitch of 90-135 m in length and 60-90m in width. The match ball is round and made of leather, filled with grass, horsehair or sheep's wool. It weighs 2.5 kg and is 85-90 cm long.\\"Lukashin, 104 This standardised version features fifteen-a-side teams (as per rugby union), and forward passing (in contrast to rugby football).Lukashin, 105 Players are allowed to knock the ball out of opponents' hands, but unlike American football the blocking of opponents without the ball is not allowed. The pushing and tripping (or hacking) of opponents is also disallowed, and players are not allowed to jump on them. The object is to get the ball into the goal mouth, which is known as a mak. Players are also only allowed to carry the ball for five seconds before passing. The game consists of two halves of thirty minutes, with a ten-minute interval. Georgia: the \\"Lelos\\" The Lelos (as they are nicknamed) are the national rugby union team of Georgia. One standard cheer of Georgian rugby union fans is Lelo, Lelo, Sakartvelo (Try, Try, Georgia).

Receiving an assignment to the 1st Artillery, he served on garrison duty in Florida and Massachusetts until May 1876, when he was ordered to the U. S. Artillery School at Fort Monroe. After 1878, he was connected almost continuously with the academic staff of instructors at the U. S. Military Academy, chiefly in the department of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. On 13 January 1880, he was promoted to 1st lieutenant. During 1884, he studied at the Freiberg, Saxony, school of mines, and at the agricultural experiment station at Wiesbaden.

Completed in stages from 1939 to 1941, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Building history Constructed almost twenty years before Alaska became the forty-ninth state, the Federal Building in Anchorage symbolized the U.S. government's commitment to the economic growth and development of the territory. Providing residents with a post office, courthouse, and other federal services, it was the first large federal building constructed in Anchorage. This block of Anchorage was designated on the original 1915 plat for the Federal Reserve Bank. The first building erected on the site was a post office, followed by a U.S. Marshals office and territorial jail, which were demolished to make way for the Federal Building. Gilbert Stanley Underwood (1890‚Äì1961) designed the original 1939‚Äì1940 building and the 1940‚Äì1941 west wing addition under the guidance of the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Underwood was a Los Angeles-based architect best known for designing National Park lodges. He also designed train stations for the Union Pacific Railroad before he began work for the federal government in 1932. While employed by the supervising architect's office, he designed several federal buildings, including the original portion of the Harry S Truman Building in Washington, D.C. He served as supervising architect from 1943‚Äì1949. The building housed every federal agency with an office in Anchorage, and tenants included the Civilian Conservation Corps, the United States Department of the Interior, the Signal Corps, and the Alaska Railroad. In order to accommodate all of them, the building expanded several times. The first wing extension, completed in 1940‚Äì1941, closely followed the original construction and housed the post office. The 1958 courtyard in-fill, a contemporary metal-clad design by Ed Crittenden, housed the Third District Court. The 1991 addition is home to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The building served as an early symbol of the federal government to Alaskans, giving them confidence in their acceptance as part of the United States. During celebrations of statehood in 1958, a huge American flag with forty-nine stars literally covered the facade of the building. One star was covered with a larger star to highlight Alaska becoming a state. Architecture Modern view of the entryway. The building is a 1930s Modern, cast-in-place reinforced concrete building with a flat roof and parapet. The original plans called for the eventual construction of a square building with a large internal courtyard, beginning with the original portion that formed the south side or base of the square. Before completion of the building in 1940, it became clear that it would not be large enough to accommodate all of the federal agencies in Anchorage, so construction began immediately on the first addition. Thus by 1941, both the base and the original portion of the western wing were complete. The western wing was enlarged and the shorter eastern wing was built later. Subsequent additions filled in portions of the courtyard rather than completing the square. Although they have undergone several alterations, the original facade and both wings of the building retain a significant degree of architectural integrity. The majority of the building has two stories and a basement. The east and west ends of the south elevation, above the main entry doors, are topped by three-story penthouses. In addition to providing access to the offices within the building, the southeast entrance originally led to the courtroom in the east wing and the southwest entrance to the post office in the west wing. Both wings have two stories and the elevations retain much of their original appearance. The building has little exterior ornamentation. The tall, narrow windows are the most distinctive element of the exterior. Their slightly recessed window frames emphasize the verticality of the windows and the building as a whole, as do the stepped recesses on either side of the main entry doors. The current windows are not original, but the visual effect is consistent with the original appearance. The interior of the building features many original noteworthy elements, yet displays the same lack of embellishment evident on the exterior. Ceramic tiled wainscoting and quarry tiled floors line the stairwells, entry vestibules, corridors and the original postal lobbies. The stairwells also retain original steel newel posts, wrought iron balusters, and stained wood handrails. The ceramic drinking fountains evident in the corridors throughout the building add to its historic integrity. The entry vestibule ceilings feature stepped cove perimeters. Remaining in place are the light fixtures evident in the original designs for the first floor lobbies and the coffered ceilings original to the first floor corridors. The corridor doors are not original. However, they replicate the original two-panel wood doors with upper panels of glass. The most significant interior space is the original federal district courtroom on the first floor. This room retains its original stained walnut wainscot and benches, and features an oil-on-canvas mural titled Alaskan Landscape behind the judge's bench. The mural was the work of Arthur Kerrick, who secured a Works Progress Administration commission in 1942. The oil-on-canvas painting was not, however, installed until the 1950s. Five murals were planned for the courtroom, but only the Kerrick mural was completed and installed. Art conservator Peter Malarkey restored the mural in 1993.

It was first named as Tryblidium unguis and described by Gustaf Lindstr√∂m in Latin from the Silurian deposits of Gotland in Sweden, in 1880.  Shell description  Drawing of the ventral view of the fragment of the shell of Pilina unguis showing the muscle scars Drawing of the ventral view of the fragment of the shell of Pilina unguis shows details of the muscle scars The length of the shell is 59‚Äì67 mm, width 47‚Äì51 mm and the height of the shell is 15‚Äì16 mm. With is shell size up to 67 mm was at least twice larger than any recent known living monoplacophoran species.Moore J. & Raith Overhill R. 2006. An introduction to the invertebrates, Second Edition. Cambridge, Cambridge University. Press, 319 pp. . Page 126. The shell has an obovate outline, anteriorly acuminate, posteriorly expanded, with the greatest width somewhat behind the median, transverse axis of the shell. It is regularly and moderately convex, being the most elevated near the median transverse axis. The apex is close to the anterior margin and only very little prominent. The surface of the shell is covered with thread-fine ornamental lines parallel to the regular concentric lines of growth, somewhat interrupted by deeper sulci. It is generally even, excepting some wavy, irregular, shallow, longitudinal furrows. The aperture is oval with comparatively thin margins, somewhat reflexed outwards. When seen from the side it forms a moderately elevated arch, being highest near the median line of the shell. The central space of the interior surface is surrounded by an oval ring of six pairs of muscular scars, open anteriorly. The posterior ones are narrow and elongate, the middle ones are transversally broad and much enlarged towards the margin of the shell. The surface of these pairs is smooth or only partially scrobiculated. The uppermost pair is more complicated and consists, as in the kindred species, of a more shallow, elongated interior portion, and of a larger exterior one, from the inner corner of which there projects a narrow sinuous groove, directed obliquely upwards and leaving a small, smooth space between itself and the opposite similar one. The lower, interior part of this upper, muscular scar is pearshaped, wide below, with a narrow, stalklike neck upwards and its surface is finely reticulated by shallow pits and intervening ridges. Some dark, narrow streaks are directed from the enclosed central space of the shell towards the interstices between the muscular scars. The whole central part of the shell inside the scars and to their outer edges is of dark color, while the outer border is lighter. Near the apex there is on the inside a little oval depression or pit, which quite resembles a scar, filled up, as if there had been a foramen. Lindstr√∂m considered this as the mark of the outlines of the initial shell, where now the apex is seen on the outside. The shell is very thin, scarcely exceeding 0.5 mm in thickness and composed of thin, glossy lamellas, which are not perforated by any parasite.  Distribution  This species has nearly the same geographical distribution as Tryblidium reticulatum. It has been found in several specimens in F√•r√∂ at Lauterhorn, Lansa and Norsholm, in Svarvare Huk, the canal near West√∂√∂s √Ñnge in Hall, V√§skinde, H√§ftingsklint, Lummelunda, Stora Vede in Follingbo, the limestone cliffs near Visby and Kyrkberget in Visby. It has only been found in the strata b and c or the upper and lower limestone and never in the shale of a. This is rather unexpected as the same species or at least a nearly allied variety, as mentioned above, has been found in the Lower Silurian strata of Estonia at Borkholm and also in the Upper Silurian at Koik, in the ¬ªJ√∂rdensche Schicht¬ª. These are only a little more elongate and not so enlarged as the specimens from Gotland. References This article incorporates public domain text from reference.Lindstr√∂m G. 1884.

Walsh United States Courthouse, also or formerly named U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, is a historic post office and courthouse building located at Tucson at Pima County, Arizona. It was a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Building history The building was constructed during 1929-1930 as a U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. It was designed in 1928-1929 by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. Planning for the building began in 1910, when the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill authorizing the purchase of a site for a new post office in Tucson. That was the same year that the statehood bill, discussed since Congress deemed Arizona worthy of statehood in 1888, finally passed the House of Representatives. Still, Arizona did not become a state until 1912. It would be another 20 years before the building was constructed. When the Treasury Department failed to act, the city purchased the site recommended by the federal site agent who visited Tucson in 1911, and the city donated the property to the federal government. Delays continued because by this time Congress had instituted a moratorium on construction due to negative publicity surrounding the awarding of building contracts. In the interim, the federal government leased out the land and a gas station and other businesses occupied the parcel. Congress lifted the construction moratorium in 1926. The appropriation for design and construction of the building occurred in 1928. Scheduled for completion in December 1930, the building was completed ahead of schedule, and opened for business on September 19, 1930. The post office operated in the building until 1974. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as \\"U.S. Post Office and Courthouse\\". In 1985, the United States Congress passed a bill renaming the building in honor of James Augustine Walsh, H.R.2698 -- A bill to designate the United States Courthouse in Tucson, Arizona, as the \\"James A. Walsh United States Courthouse\\". who served as a federal district judge from 1952 to 1981. For the first eighteen years of his tenure Walsh was the only judge in the U.S. District Court in Tucson. The U.S. District Court moved out of the Walsh Courthouse in 2000 into the newly completed Evo A. DeConcini Courthouse in Tucson. In 2002, a remodeling project was begun in order to accommodate the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, which would be the new long- term tenant of the building. After the first phase of the project was completed, the Bankruptcy Court moved in and remained in the building during the second phase of construction, completed in 2008. Architecture The building is a well-executed, well-preserved example of the Neoclassical architectural style. The building was designed in 1928-1929 by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, then under the direction of Acting Supervising Architect James A. Wetmore. The Walsh building is a neoclassical arrangement modified by a Mission-style roof. The neoclassical style is characterized by symmetry of plan, frontal arrangement, monumental proportions, and flat, smooth or polished stone surfaces. The Treasury Department favored neoclassicism as the appropriate architectural style for most of the federal buildings constructed during this time period. However, the Mission-style variations on the building are used to moderate the rigid neoclassical lines while acknowledging the local building tradition. The decoration of the building is understated, but the primary (south) facade of the building is the most elaborate in ornament and detail. It is lavishly finished with terracotta sheathing, which is contrasted by small amounts of brickwork in the two end bays. Two tiers of superimposed rows of pilasters dominate this facade. The entablature of the lower tier bears the words \\"United States Court House.\\" Each level features six engaged columns with stylized Composite capitals. There are stylized eagles above each of the fourth floor windows, and other terracotta ornaments are visible on this facade. There are two large entry doors for the building, one at either end of this bay and each featuring a classical surround with a flat pediment. At either end of the central bay are brick-faced bays framed by terracotta quoins (corner elements). The other elevations are relatively unembellished, although the east front gained some significance when the main entry door was moved to this side in the recent remodeling project. The exterior exhibits a high degree of its original character, with only minimal alterations evident. A post office originally occupied the first floor and remained there until 1974. When the post office moved out, the first floor post office workroom was remodeled for use as a courtroom, and the original main post office lobby was converted into a jury assembly room. The original skylight in the postal workroom was covered, and the lobby was broken up into smaller spaces. The recent renovation project restored the main lobby to its original open configuration and preserved many of its original elements and finishes, including the terracotta tiled, basketweave patterned floor, the plaster walls, the marble wainscots and floor borders, and the ceilings with molded plaster crowns. The former postal workroom now serves as an intake area for the Courts. The original postal workroom skylight was enclosed, but two new \\"belvedere\\" skylights, which allow natural light into the space but significantly reduce heat gain, were installed. The second, third, and fourth stories consist of corridors around the light well, each of which contains a mixture of offices and courtroom spaces. The most significant interior space is the main courtroom, located on the southern side of the third and fourth floors. The space retains many of its original elements, including the wood- beamed ceiling with stenciled patterns, original wainscoting, plaster walls, and wooden window and door frames and surrounds. The historic courtroom was a primary focus of the second phase of the recent renovation project. Inappropriate non-historic light fixtures were replaced with more compatible fixtures, the stenciled ceiling received conservation treatment, and the judge's bench and jury box were reconfigured to meet the needs of the Bankruptcy Court. This building is the best-preserved example of Tucson's Depression-era architecture.

Hence, the name ALICE, for ALuminium ICE rocket propellant. Aluminium has a stronger affinity for oxygen than most elements, which is most visible in aluminothermic reactions such as thermite. This allows aluminium to burn with a large release of heat in substances that one normally considers to be inert, such as carbon dioxide and water. However, aluminium combustion is normally hindered by the presence of a durable oxide layer that forms on the surface of aluminium particles, requiring significant heat to overcome. Additionally, aluminium oxide condenses out of the exhaust stream at high temperature, leaving it (and its heat of condensation) unable to contribute to expansion unless there is another gas present to function as a working fluid. This generally has relegated aluminium's role in rocketry to that of being an additive to solid rocket propellants, increasing their density and combustion temperature and stabilizing the burn. The oxide layer in nano-aluminium powder, however, is thinner and easier to overcome than in that of larger particles. This makes the combustion of aluminium with water ice easier to ignite and sustain. Furthermore, as the aluminium consumes the oxygen, it liberates hydrogen which functions as a low molecular mass working fluid to translate the heat of combustion (and subsequently condensation) into expansion and thrust. The high density of the mixture allows for reduced tankage mass and high thrust. The base combustion reaction is: : 2 Al + 3 H2O ‚Üí Al2O3 \\\\+ 3 H2 ALICE has been proposed as a propellant well suited for in-situ production on outer space bodies such as the moon, as both aluminium oxide (a source of aluminium) and water are abundant resources in the universe, while the high propellant density decreases the dry mass of the rocket. Maintaining the propellant in a frozen state is relatively simple on most bodies in the solar system, while other high performance propellants often involve cryogenic fluids that can pose long-term storage problems.

Hobby (1899‚Äì1942), was a United States Navy officer killed in action during World War II for whom a U.S. Navy ship was named. Biography William Matthews Hobby, Jr., was born on 27 July 1899 in Sylvania, Georgia. He was appointed a midshipman from the 1st Congressional District of Georgia on 20 June 1919, attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated in the class of 1923. After initial sea duty in the battleship USS Oklahoma (BB-37) from June 1923 to April 1925, Hobby underwent brief aviation instruction at Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. He then reported to the destroyer USS Kidder (DD-319) on 21 November 1925 and served in Kidder as she earned the Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal. Hobby then underwent submarine instruction at Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, from late December 1927 to June 1928. He then travelled to the United States Asiatic Fleet, where he reported to the submarine tender USS Canopus (AS-9) on 10 August 1928, prior to his joining the submarine USS S-37 (SS-142) on 20 August 1928. After successive tours in the submarines USS S-41 (SS-146) and USS S-30 (SS-135), Hobby returned to the United States for service at the United States Naval Academy from May 1931 to June 1933. He then helped to fit out the submarine USS Cachalot (SS-170) before serving back-to- back tours in the battleship USS Tennessee (BB-43) and training ship USS Wyoming (AG-17) into the summer of 1938. Hobby reported to the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Kearny, New Jersey, on 11 May 1939, to supervise the fitting out of the new Sims-class destroyer and to become her first commanding officer when she was placed in commission. Detached from Anderson on 22 March 1941, Hobby then rejoined the battleship Oklahoma (BB-37) on 26 March 1941 as damage control officer and first lieutenant. After Oklahoma capsized and sank in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Hobby served briefly in the 12th Naval District before he joined the new battleship USS Washington (BB-56) on 3 January 1942. He acted as navigator of Washington until he relieved Commander Walter E. Moore as executive officer of the light cruiser USS Juneau (CL-52) at Espiritu Santo on 2 November 1942. On 12 November 1942, ten days after he reported aboard, Juneau was heavily damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The following afternoon, 13 November 1942, while she was returning to Espiritu Santo, the Japanese submarine I-26 torpedoed her. The torpedo hit detonated Juneaus magazine, and she disintegrated in a massive explosion, leaving only ten survivors. Commander Hobby was among those who perished in the cataclysmic blast that tore the ship apart. Namesakes The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS William M. Hobby (DE-236) was named for Commander Hobby. During construction, she was converted into a high-speed transport, and was in commission as such as USS William M. Hobby (APD-95) from 1945 to 1946.

It is in the Queen Anne architectural style. Its front facade has some classically-inspired ornament, dating it to the \\"Free Classical\\" phase of the Queen Anne style, a precursor to the Colonial Revival style that became popular in the early 20th century. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The house is on a lot on the east side of the street, at the southeast corner of the Wiltwyck Avenue intersection. The neighborhood is residential. It is a two-and-a-half-story building on a stone foundation, sided in clapboard on the first story and shingles on the second. The two stories are divided by a belt course, above which the walls flare. Above the roofline, marked by a molded cornice and denticulated cornice, is a steeply pitched hipped roof pierced by a gabled dormer window on the west (front) elevation. The front facade has a wooden porch on its north section and a projecting bay on its southern third. Broad Doric columns support the porch's shed roof and plain entablature. An offset pedimented gable surmounts the main steps, with laurel and garland in the tympanum, echoed between the two windows above and the dormer gable. Bay windows of three and four units respectively mark the two stories on the south. Above them a projecting pedimented gable has a small Palladian window at its center. The south profile is less decorated, with two groups of windows and a lancet on the first floor comprising its fenestration. On the east (rear) is a small single-story extension covered by a hipped roof. The north side, facing Wiltwyck Avenue, has an unusual six-panel stair light. Above it is more classical decoration, a detailed cornice with a swag-ornamented frieze. It is accompanied by a three- paneled bay window similar to the one on the south of the front elevation and a centrally located gabled dormer in the roof, as well. At the main entrance, paneled entrance doors in a finely crafted floral motif open into a vestibule/stair hall. The stair is the one accompanying the light on the north side, and it has finely crafted balusters and paneling. The central hall is lit by the bay window to the north and a Queen Anne window on the rear. From there an archway leads to the south parlor, with parquet flooring and a period fireplace and mantel. The second floor also retains its original plan and finish, including most of the woodwork. Behind the house is a carriage house built at the same time, now used as a garage. It is considered a contributing resource to the property's historic character and thus is included in the National Register listing. History and aesthetics Like nearby 313 Albany Avenue, built the previous year, 356 Albany reflects the Free Classical phase of the Queen Anne style. One of the most common modes for upscale late Victorian homes, the style was an attempt to evoke the first years of the 18th century in England, when medieval buildings were updated with decorative touches. In the late 19th century, the style was typified by a complex interplay of forms and contrasts in colors and surface textures, all of which are present in 356 Albany. In the last years of the century, architects expanded the style's ornamental vocabulary to include classical elements, such as the house's porch columns and the laurel-and-garland motif on the east facade. The use of Georgian elements, most notably the Palladian window seen both here and at 313 Albany, was another sign of the maturing style. In the U.S., these eventually led to the wider embrace of mid-18th century forms and the Colonial Revival. The original owner of the house is not known, but it was clearly someone of a socioeconomic stature that could afford to build in the most contemporary style of the day, with elaborate interior detailing (also found at 313 Albany). It has remained a private residence since its construction.

It is the first feature directed by an Australian Aboriginal woman. With this film, Moffatt challenges racial stereotypes in Australian society. The film is a trilogy of surreal ghost stories. Inspired by ghost stories she heard as a child from both her extended Aboriginal and Irish Australian families, Tracey Moffatt has constructed a sublime trilogy in which characters are haunted by the past and bewitched by memories. All three stories are set in Moffatt's highly stylized, hyper-real, hyper-imaginary Australian landscape. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Plot  Mr. Chuck  Mr. Chuck is the first of the three-part series featured in BeDevil. It tells the story of a young indigenous boy haunted by the ghost of an American GI who drowned in the swamp around which much of this segment takes place. Various nonlinear events of the boy's childhood are presented through the perspectives of two narrators: the boy as an older man reflecting on his youth and a white woman whose family took part in the colonization of this area of Australia. The film follows the young boy as he observes and interacts with white settlers who are building a cinema on top of the swamp, while simultaneously holding a caretaker position to his two younger siblings, experiencing abuse at the hands of adults in his family, and having episodic interactions with the ghost of the American GI. These clips of memory are framed by the two narrators‚Äô alternating recounting of them, presented in the style of a documentary interview.  Choo Choo Choo Choo  In the desolate plains of outback Queensland, Ruby (played by Moffatt herself) and her family are haunted by invisible trains which run on a track beside their house. The ghost of a young girl killed by a train drives Ruby and her family away. After many years Ruby returns to experience the ghostly presence yet again.  Lovin' the Spin I'm in  Imelda's people are Torres Strait Islanders. When her son Bebe and his love, Minnie, leave their community to escape opposition to their marriage, Imelda follows them to a small town in north Queensland. Tragedy strikes - Bebe and Minnie die, but the doomed couple never find peace. The spirits of Minnie and Bebe dance on a condemned warehouse and refuse to leave. Themes Storytelling is a central concern of beDevil. Creating and sharing stories is a way to make sense of the world, and both encourages and reflects connections between the past and the present, and people and places. Through the process of telling us their stories, each of the narrators in beDevil recount shared tales, a sort of modern folklore. While this brings to mind the importance of storytelling to Indigenous traditions, Moffatt explicitly states that these stories ‚Äúcome from both sides of my background ‚Äì my white relatives as well as my black relatives.‚Äù Yet she also insists that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can call the stories particularly white or Aboriginal‚Äù. The hybrid nature of Moffatt's work reflects the way that she perceives the multicultural make-up of Australian society, and she explains that ‚Äúit is completely natural for me to represent that mixing of races‚Äù. beDevil is very much about her stories, weaving together ‚Äúa personal mythology‚Äù, and presenting images that are ‚Äúso personal that a lot of the time they embarrass me‚Äù.

While a full-time student, she worked as a television soap opera actress and then as a marketeer for one Taiwanese and two European pharmaceutical companies. Predictions as Asian Strategist On May 26, 1989, in the heat of worldwide support for the Chinese students' efforts towards seeking democracy, Chin-Ning gave a speech which was recorded by The Colombian, a Vancouver, Washington newspaper, \\"The students in China must control their passion a little bit and go back to the strategy board because they cannot win as they are doing.\\" On May 29, 1989, in the midst of all the foreign companies frantically pulling out of China, Chin-Ning told The Seattle Times, \\"The political struggle in Beijing is no reason for Americans doing business in China to panic . . . business opportunities for Americans are likely to become more open.\\" Chu described the present confrontation between students and government leaders as \\"just one little turn\\" in a long series of events in China. It is always in the state of becoming. There never are any final consequences . . .\\" On June 14, 1994, Capitol Hill was concerned over the danger of North Korea invading South Korea and their development of nuclear weapons. Appearing on \\"Larry King Live,\\" Chin-Ning predicted the correct outcome‚Äîin opposition to positions taken by General Scowcroft and Senator Kerry of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Speaker and trainer  Chin-Ning's client list reads like a global \\"Who's Who\\" that includes many of the Fortune 500 corporations, governments, universities, and worldwide organizations. She was sought throughout the world as a keynote speaker and corporate trainer.

It is located in the Dhule taluka of Dhule District in Maharashtra. Location Lamkani is located on the junction of Maharashtra State Highway 10 (SH 10) and 12 (SH 12). It is located at 210 05‚Äô17.37\\" N 74034‚Äô08.09\\" E. Lamkani can be reached from Dhule by taking National Highway (NH 3) up to Sarwad village road junction (18 km) and then taking State Highway 12 (SH 12) toward west direction that passes through Nandane, Burzad, and Boris village, finally reaching Lamkani. It is at a distance of 42 km by route, but this road is well maintained. Alternately, Lamkani can be reached from Dhule city by Mehergaon route. One can go straight way from Dhule by State Highway 14 (SH 14) up to Mehergaon (18 km) and then taking SH 10 (15 km) that passes through Lamkani. It is at a distance of 33 km by this route and shorter by 9 km.  Ecological History  Lamkani has total 3000 hectares of village catchment area consisting of gaothan - the village site, agricultural land, forest, fallow or waste land. The forest area admeasures about 400 ha. Prior to 1960, the forest area was reasonably rich in tree and grasses to the extent that it could fulfill the requirements of small size timber for farm implements, fuel wood for cooking, grasses and fodder for cattle, then village population, as told by the village elders living in the village. With the availability of this natural resource and farm grown fodder the villagers practiced animal husbandry and kept milch cattle like cows and buffaloes. The agriculture was irrigated from dug out wells which later on shifted to tube wells. The locality of Lamkani receives average annual rainfall of 400 mm. and therefore falls in the category of \\"Drought Prone Area\\" as defined by the District Administration. However, during last five decades there has been gradual and perceptible erratic rainfall pattern in this locality as experienced by the villagers. This is reported to affect crop yields adversely and so was the impact on the vegetation around that included the forest area. So also with increase in human population from sixties to nineties coupled with cattle population, the biotic pressure on the forest gradually increased which caused the degradation of tree growth and loss of grasses. The heavy grazing by the cattle resulted stoppage of regeneration of new grasses due to no seeding of seeds and trampling of new grasses. The ecological conditions of the village deteriorated over period of time. The number of cattle slowly reduced due to lesser fodder and grass availability. The dairying profession was reduced and finally had to be completely abandoned. The water levels in the wells dropped creating shortage of water for villagers and their cattle which necessitated villagers to search for deeper sources that came from handy in the form of tube wells; thanks to the drilling technology. During 1997‚Äì2000, the village saw drilling of about 200 tube wells to augment the water requirements. So also the villagers saw deeper drilling to reach water table that dropped from average of 350 feet to 950 feet. The water scarcity however could not improve. The village was required to be supplied water by tanker from other places. That was perhaps the worst point of time - the year 2000, in the ecological history of the village. All Information From Ravi Nanabhau Girase  Lamkani's Resolve ‚Äì Joint Forest Management  The villagers in the year 2001 came together and formed Joint Forest Management Committee as per Government of Maharashtra Scheme.  Climate  Lamkani has three distinct seasons during the year: summer, winter, and the rainy season. Summer months are hot and spread over April, May and June. The day time temperature reaches up to 43 0 C. May is the hottest month. Dusty and hot winds of varying velocity are common during summer. Winter is spread over November to mid-February. Winter temperature drops down to minimum 10 0 C. Snowfall and smog are unknown. However hailstorms of mild intensity are occasionally reported. Rainy season starts by mid-June and lasts till September. The average annual rain fall is 350 mm spread over about 45 rainy days. The nearest rain gauge station is at Dhule. Rains are received from the South- West mansion winds. Showers from North ‚Äì East mansion are very rare. Lamkani has very erratic rainfall pattern. During the rainy monsoon season the skies are moderately clouded. For the rest of the year skies are mostly clear. During the South-West monsoon season the humidity is about 60 per cent. The air is dry during the rest of the year. The driest part of the year is of course summer when the relative humidity is about 20 per cent at the mid day.

Biography In 1966, he obtained a master's degree in philosophy and a degree in French literature and civilization. During the next four years, he taught at the French school in Compi√®gne in 1967 and obtained a DES (', roughly equivalent to an MA) in Philosophy and a degree in Ancient Greece. Portrait of Youssef Seddik From 1971 to 1977 he taught philosophy in secondary schools in Tunisia and at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle, before becoming director of a publishing company specializing in books for young people between 1984 and 1987. He was also a reporter of the journal La Presse de Tunisie between 1975 and 1983. Based in Paris in 1988, he obtained a DEA in the Greek language and civilization from the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle (1988) and a doctorate at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (1995). He lectured there and also in modern Islamic philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1995 to 1996. Seddik has published many books and translations based on Ancient Greece and Islamic heritage, including works related to the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Ali, and the Qur'an. He also attempted to publish a Qur'an in the form of seven volumes of comics, but was halted after objections from the Tunisian religious authorities in 1992. In 1999 he published a book entitled Brins de chicane. La vie quotidienne √† Bagdad au Xe si√®cle about daily life in Baghdad in the tenth century. His book, Nous n'avons jamais lu le Coran, released in September 2004 explores the language and symbols that are present in the Koran.

Turek is a recent recipient of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant for research designed to help infertile men become fathers using stem cells. Early life Turek was born in Manchester, Connecticut to immigrant parents. His mother was the administrative secretary in the Manchester public school system, while his father was a sheet metal mechanic and welder. He attended Manchester High School and graduated salutatorian in 1978. Education and Training At Yale College he graduated summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, received the Henry J. Belknap Prize in the Biological Sciences, and co- authored several scientific publications from work in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Handschumacher in the Department of Pharmacology at the Yale School of Medicine. While at Stanford Medical School, he participated in immunology research and developed an interest in the surgical discipline of urology. He pursued his internship and residency training in urology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. During this time, he developed an interest in urologic microsurgery and reproductive medicine and soon after pursued fellowship training in microsurgery and male reproductive medicine under the guidance of Dr. Larry Lipshultz at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. After completing his fellowship, he was recruited to the faculty of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Medical background Turek is a board-certified urologist and microsurgeon, specializing in male fertility. He has performed and published research in men's reproductive health issues including genetic infertility, ejaculatory duct obstruction, immunologic infertility, quality of life issues with infertility, testis cancer and stem cell science, and has developed several techniques for evaluating and treating male infertility. While at UCSF, he was Director of the Male Reproductive Clinical Laboratory, Program Leader of PROGENI (The Program in the Genetics of Infertility), Director of the UCSF Men's Reproductive Health Clinic and Research Program, and the director of a National Institutes of Health grant to train new faculty in men's reproductive health. He has authored more than 175 publications on clinical and scientific issues in reproductive health. Through his published work, he is a proponent of the theory that male infertility is an early marker for other diseases that occur later in life. He became a full professor, with an endowed chair in teaching funded by the Academy at UCSF, a chair he later abandoned in favor of starting his own private clinic.http://www.cpmc.org/providersearch/?sitecfg=49&vs;=detail&action;=providerdetail&masterid;=19709&isLevelOne;=1&recId;=ps99848sp9984838171778&healthplans;=0&physname;=Paul J. Turek, M.D.He is now Director of The Turek Clinics, medical centers in California that specialize exclusively in men's reproductive health care. He was President in 2011 of the American Society of Andrology and the Society of Male Reproduction and Urology in 2013. Research and inventions Turek has designed and led in numerous key research programs, as well as inventing several procedures, that have had significant impact on the science of men's reproductive health. Turek is an advocate for men's general health, and speaks about on the topic on television and at companies such as Google. He is on the medical advisory board for Fertile Hope, a LIVESTRONG Foundation initiative. FNA Mapping Turek is the inventor of Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) Mapping, also known less formally as sperm mapping, testicular cartography, or \\"GPS for the testis.\\" FNA Mapping is a non-invasive office procedure that can be performed in a standardized, template fashion to identify men who qualify for, and assist in the planning of, sperm retrieval for IVF-ICSI.Turek PJ, Givens C, Schriock ED, Meng M, Pederson RA and Conaghan J. Testis sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection guided by prior fine needle aspiration mapping in nonobstructive azoospermia. Fertility and Sterility. 71: 552-8, 1999This technique has been important because it has improved identification of men who are likely to have a successful sperm retrieval while at the same time avoiding costly and unnecessary assisted reproductive techniques. FNA Mapping has become a fundamental procedure in the profession and has been adopted at most reproductive centers around the world.Shefi S, Kaplan K and Turek PJ. Analysis of spermatogenesis in nonobstructive azoospermic and virtually azoospermic men with known testicular pathology. Reprod Biol Med Online. 18: 460-64, 2009.The success of assisted reproductive techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) encouraged reproductive clinicians to look beyond the ejaculate and into the male reproductive tract to find sperm. In men with no sperm count (azoospermia), it soon became clear that sperm could be found in the testes and used with ICSI, but sperm production was characteristically \\"patchy\\" or \\"focal\\" in azoospermic testes. FNA Mapping was designed to diagnose the degree of \\"patchiness\\" of sperm production in azoospermic men and determine, among other things, whether a sperm retrieval would succeed in a specific patient.Turek P.J, I. Cha, Ljung, B-M., and Conaghan J. Diagnostic Findings From Testis Fine Needle Aspiration Mapping in Obstructed and Non-Obstructed Azoospermic Men. Journal of Urology, 163: 1709-1716, 2000.Prior to FNA Mapping, testis biopsy was the major procedure for determining the quality of sperm presence. Testis biopsy is a more invasive procedure than FNA Mapping, and studies have shown that FNA Mapping provides better and more complete information about sperm presence.Turek PJ, I Cha, and Ljung, B-M.

Published online 20 May 2008 Evolving the hypoosmotic swelling test The Hypoosmotic Swelling Test is a laboratory test to measure the functional integrity of the human sperm membrane. In this test, the sperm is exposed to a hypososmotic solution consisting of a 50:50 mixture of 150 mosmol fructose and 150 mosmol sodium citrate. The tails of normal sperm will swell when exposed to this solution, whereas damaged sperm with low motility will not swell measurably. Although a moving or motile sperm was traditionally required for use with this technique, some infertile men have genetically immotile sperm and are unable to take advantage of this technology to become fathers.Turek PJ and Smikle CB. Viability of Non-Motile Sperm. Assisted Reproduction Reviews. 7: 34-38, 1997 In early research in this area, Turek tried to understand more about how sperm \\"viability\\" relates to \\"motility.\\"Bachtell N, and Conaghan J. and Turek PJ.

New approach to genetic testing for male infertility Concerned about the risk of transmitting genetic male infertility or other genetic issues to offspring with the use of modern assisted reproductive techniques such as ICSI, Turek founded a unique, trademarked program called PROGENI (Program in the Genetics of Infertility) at the University of California San Francisco. PROGENI's methodology is based on the classic genetic counseling philosophy that advocates non-prescriptive testing for genetic disease (an approach which is based on informing the patient of risks and then letting the patient decide whether he will undergo testing to delineate risk). Turek has published over a dozen papers on improved patient outcomes and decision making from over 800 patients that have entered the program since inception.,Black LD, Nudell DM, Cha I, Cherry AM and PJ Turek.

To solve the problem of limited embryonic stem cell availability, Turek and his colleagues invented a process by which the early germline stem cells from the normal adult testis, called spermatogonia, can be coaxed into becoming true, embryonic-like stem cells when placed in an appropriate culture environment.Kossak N, Meneses J, Shefi S, Nyugen HN Chavez S, Nicholas C, Gromoll J, Turek PJ and Reijo Pera R.

In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established structural functionalism, yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly. While both maintain the fundamental belief that a social structure is composed of many interdependent frames of reference, biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a social solidarity and collective conscience is required in a functioning system. By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible. Everyday application Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still self-preservation, albeit unsuccessful. An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched cognitive psychological motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals is an historic building originally constructed as a Spanish Colonial Revival style resort known as the Vista del Arroyo Hotel and Bungalows located at Pasadena in Los Angeles County, California. During World War II, it served as the McCornack General Hospital, and was thereafter in use as a general-purpose federal government building for several decades. It now serves as a courthouse of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Building history Set on the crest of a steep hill overlooking the Arroyo Seco River, the Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals Building towers over its setting and dominates the view from across the Arroyo. Originally built as a hotel during the late stages of Pasadena's great resort hotel age, the main building was constructed in two sections‚Äîthe two-story north wing, in 1920, and the six-story bell tower with flanking wings, in 1930. The site's resort history dates to 1882, when Emma C. Bangs opened the original La Vista del Arroyo Hotel, a two-story, wood-frame building, and series of small cottages. In 1919, hotel tycoon Daniel M. Linnard, associated with such elegant Pasadena hotels as the Huntington and Green, purchased La Vista del Arroyo with the vision of developing the property into an opulent resort. Linnard commissioned the architectural firm of Marston & Van Pelt to design a large, two-story Spanish Colonial Revival hotel to replace the original structure. Once the popularity of the Vista had been established, select guests also built bungalows on the property. In 1926, Linnard sold the resort to former business partner H.O. Comstock. Comstock hired architect George H. Wiemeyer to redesign the hotel and add a grand six-story addition that consisted of a central bell tower and flanking wings set at an angle. The new Vista opened in 1931 with iridescent color, entertainment, and social gaiety. In 1936, Linnard repurchased the property and hired landscape architect Verner S. Anderson to improve the hotel's grounds by designing formal gardens and adding fountains, tennis courts, and a swimming pool. In 1943 the U.S. War Department acquired the hotel complex and converted it into the McCornack General Hospital and offices for the U.S. Army. The hospital was named after Brigadier General Condon C. McCornack, Command Surgeon of the Western Defense Command.http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/civilaffairs/chapter4.htm/ In 1949, the hospital was closed and the old hotel, under the care of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), housed a variety of Federal agencies from 1951 to 1974. In 1981 the Vista del Arroyo was placed in the National Register of Historic Places and GSA began design work to restore the building as the southern seat of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1995, the building was renamed to honor Judge Richard H. Chambers, whose concept it was to bring a Federal courthouse to Pasadena. Architecture The courthouse is the largest of several buildings adjacent to a residential district at the western edge of Pasadena. The old hotel was constructed primarily in two sections: a two-story steel and wood frame section built in 1920-21, and a six-story reinforced concrete portion built in 1930-1931. The buildings were joined together at the original main entrance, their first floors aligning on the interior to form a continuous first level. The two sections form a U-shaped plan, oriented to face the Colorado Street Bridge. Only the northernmost portion of the 1920 building remains‚Äîits southern half and central campanile (bell tower) were removed for the 1930s addition. thumb Both the 1920 and the 1930 sections were designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with a skillful interplay of stucco walls, arched openings, and terracotta tile roof. The exterior ornamental detailing is very simple, with bracketed balconies, an arcaded ground level, and Spanish Colonial Revival features such as circular windows and twisted balusters. The most prominent component of the building, the 1930 tower, is richly embellished and capped with a dome covered with patterned dual-toned tiles. Between 1920 and 1937, four architects played significant roles in designing the Vista del Arroyo. Sylvanus Marston and Garrett Van Pelt were responsible for the plans for the 1920 hotel. In 1921, architect Myron Hunt transformed the Vista Hotel into one of the premier resorts in Pasadena, designing several of the hotel's original bungalows. Pasadena architect George H. Wiemeyer designed the elegant six- story addition in 1930. The first floor of the interior was richly ornamented. At the hotel entrance, visitors strolled through a vine-covered pergola to a lobby embellished with decorative pilasters, freestanding columns, and plaster moldings. From the elaborate Morning Room and Sunset Room, guests viewed the gardens and outdoor activities as the day progressed. A number of cottages, including the elaborate Maxwell House remain in privately owned portions of the original property. On the still owned by the Government, GSA continues to maintain the original paths, patios, and gardens. During the 1980s, GSA restored the building exterior, grounds, and ornamental interior spaces to their original appearance under the design direction of J. Rudy Freeman of Neptune & Thomas, earning awards from the American Institute of Architects and National Endowment for the Arts. Suspended ceilings were removed and original plaster decorations recreated in the Spanish Room (now a courtroom), Dining Room (now a library), Lounge (now offices), Morning Room (now a conference room), and foyers. The Spanish Room is particularly lavish; its rich detail includes a highly decorative ceiling with large cast-iron grilles and walls with wrought-iron grilles. The original Dining Room features plaster pilasters and columns, wrought-iron light fixtures, large arched window openings, and a beamed ceiling. The elevator lobby and west foyer also retain significant original elements, such as the decorative elevator doors and original glazed- tile risers of the main stair. A reconstructed rose-covered pergola, restored fountain, and colorful plantings greet today's visitors to the U.S. Court of Appeals. An irreplaceable landmark serves a new public use as a centerpiece of the community. Significant events *1882: Emma C.

Browning U.S. Court of Appeals Building is a historic post office and courthouse building located at San Francisco, California. It is a courthouse for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Completed in 1905 as the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, it was intended to represent the affluence and increasing importance of the United States as it became a world power. The building survived both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. History By the 1870s it became apparent that San Francisco was in dire need of a federal building to house the federal courts and the post office that were located in various downtown buildings. In 1887 a commission delegated to select a site reported that the $350,000 allocated by the U.S. Congress was insufficient and the sum was raised to $1,250,000. The property chosen at Seventh and Mission Streets was more than a mile from the central business district and surrounded by a working-class neighborhood of Irish and German immigrants. Although many disapproved, the lot was purchased in 1891. In 1893 $2,500,000 was appropriated for construction. U.S. Treasury architects worked on designs for the building, with Supervising Architect James Knox Taylor (1857-1929) playing a lead role. Taylor selected a design influenced by Italian Renaissance architecture with magnificent Beaux Arts grandeur. To achieve the high level of craftsmanship specified for the interior, skilled artisans were brought from Italy, who reportedly later worked on San Simeon. Groundbreaking took place in 1897 and the building opened in 1905 to acclaim as \\"a post office that's a palace\\". On April 18, 1906, an earthquake devastated San Francisco. The courthouse and post office building survived the quake with little damage and thanks to the efforts of postal workers, only one room, now Courtroom 3, the Redwood Room, was damaged by the ensuing fire. It and the 1874 U.S. Mint designed by Alfred B. Mullett were the only buildings south of Market Street to survive the earthquake and resulting fires. While repairs were made, the Post Office set up collection points around the city, with the building serving as a symbol of hope in the weeks following the earthquake. Restoration was completed in 1910. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In 1989 the Loma Prieta earthquake severely damaged the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office. Engineering evaluation started immediately and in 1993 restoration work began, including seismic retrofitting to protect against future earthquakes. The building reopened in 1996 as the U.S. Court of Appeals. In 2005, the building was renamed in honor of Judge James R. Browning. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on October 16, 2012 for its architecture. Architecture The building as it appeared in 1905. The building reflects the Beaux Arts classicism adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department for early twentieth-century federal buildings. The stylized building is a steel-framed structure clad in white Sierra granite. The magnificent building, with its opulent ornamentation and surface treatments, was exceptionally lavish even at the time of its construction. The imposing building, echoing the Italian palazzos designed by Bramante and Raphael during the Renaissance, is ornamented with enclosed pediments, balustrades, and rows of arched windows. The beautiful bronze entry lanterns are replicas of the torch-holders designed in 1489 by Niccolo Grosso for the home of Filippo Strozzi, the richest banker in Florence. The building features six lunette mosaics on allegorical themes, designed by artist Earl Stetson Crawford: a group of three representing \\"Columbia's progress in the arts and sciences during the present century\\" and another group of three representing \\"Law and her attributes\\". Crawford won the commission through an open competition. The Great Hall on the third floor of the courthouse. Originally, the building was a three-story structure with a fourth story, or attic level, set back from the facade and partially hidden behind the cornice and balustrade. This main block of the building was U-shaped with an interior courtyard. The courtyard was ornamented with geometric patterns of red, white, and blue glazed brick walls and one hundred pink-tongued lion heads along the cornice. In order to provide desperately needed office space to meet the needs of the expanding federal bureaucracy, noted San Francisco architect George Kelham (1871-1936) was commissioned in 1933 to design a four-story addition for the east side of the building, enclosing the interior courtyard. The addition repeats the design of the original facades, although the third and fourth stories are veneered in terra cotta. Although the building's exterior is impressive in the quality of detail, ornamentation, and material, the elegant interiors are even more exquisite. The post office originally occupied the ground floor with a lobby running the width of the Seventh Street (main) facade. The second floor had offices for court staff and federal agencies, while the third floor contained the ornate courtrooms, judicial chambers, and conference rooms. Rare and exquisite materials on each of the floors of the building include a range of imported marble, such as Carrara and Yellow Siena from Italy, Pacific Coast Salmon Pink, and Red Numidian from North Africa. The grand first-floor hall, accessible through massive bronze doors, is paneled in black-veined white Italian marble trimmed in green marble from Maryland and Vermont. Marble mosaics adorn the groin-vaulted ceiling. The floor is composed of ceramic-tile mosaic. Stained-glass domes ringed with marble-mosaic tile eagles enhance the rotundas at each end of the hall. Courtroom One The Great Hall, located on the third floor, is adorned with white marble walls, Doric order columns, and a vaulted ceiling beautifully ribbed with gold trimmed plaster ornamentation. This hall leads to Courtroom One, the most elaborate interior space in the building. Originally designed for the U.S. District Court, Courtroom One features Marble mosaics, columns with carved Composite capitals, carved fruit motifs, cast-plaster cupids and flowers, and stained- glass windows. In contrast to the opulence of the Beaux Arts designed spaces, the two courtrooms on the second floor of the 1933-1934 addition are designed in the sleek Moderne style. Detailing in these spaces include the labyrinth- patterned ceiling, cork walls, and gilded plaster eagles. Additions and renovations took place throughout its history, including an extensive restoration project overseen by Judge Richard H. Chambers during the 1960s. The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 caused major damage, initiating a $91,000,000 seismic retrofitting and restoration effort. In addition to the installation of base isolators, the project, led by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, included repairs, modernization, and restoration and the addition of of space for a law library and offices in the former Post Office area. The building formally reopened as the U.S. Court of Appeals Building for the Ninth Circuit on October 17, 1996, the seventh anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake.

It is a courthouse for the United States bankruptcy court for the Southern District of California. Building history Fueled by plans to build the Panama Canal, the turn of the 20th century brought aspirations of prosperity and status to San Diego. Civic leaders who lobbied for the construction of the canal hoped that the promise of increased commerce would establish San Diego as an international trade center rivaling San Francisco. A new federal building was commissioned to showcase San Diego's newfound standing and to provide governmental offices in anticipation of a burgeoning population and urban growth. To attract attention to the city, civic leaders began planning the 1915 Panama-California Exposition to celebrate the successful completion of the canal. The U.S. Courthouse was completed in 1913 and opened in time for the Exposition. Originally called the U.S. Post Office and Customs House, the building also housed the U.S. District Court, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the U.S. Weather Bureau. When economic crisis followed the outbreak of World War I, urban development in San Diego decelerated, halting plans to construct additional civic buildings adjacent to the U.S. Courthouse. Instead, the Courthouse's large front lawn was converted to a \\"victory\\" vegetable garden to support the war effort. When prosperity was renewed during the 1950s and 1960s, the Courthouse's caseloads became the heaviest in the nation, requiring a new Federal building complex, which was completed nearby in 1976. Even though the Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, it was abandoned for the following decade. Attention refocused on the building in 1985, when much of the interior was gutted for conversion to INS offices. That same year, however, champions of historic preservation campaigned to restore the building. In 1988, the U.S. Courthouse was renamed in honor of Judge Jacob Weinberger. In 1994, an award-winning renovation and restoration project renewed the historic lobby and main courtroom to their original beauty while creating new offices and courtrooms that evoked the elegant style of the 1913 period. Architecture The Jacob Weinberger U.S. Courthouse masterfully melds two distinct architectural styles ‚Äì Classical Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival ‚Äì in a public building that speaks of San Diego's Hispanic heritage and its American ambitions. James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, described his design for the building as, \\"an adoption of the Spanish Renaissance, a style suitable to the traditions of the country ‚Äì the history of the state, the climate and the desires of the people ‚Äì it would follow the Mission style.\\" Taylor's design resulted in an unprecedented amalgamation that quickly achieved regional prominence. Occupying the northern half of the city block along West F Street, the T-shaped building is constructed of stucco-covered brick masonry walls resting on a limestone base, with steel columns and beams to support reinforced slab floors. The portico, with its grand Ionic order colonnade, stands as San Diego's only surviving Classical Revival facade. The portico's ten concrete columns rise two stories to Ionic capitals sheathed in terracotta, supporting a terra-cotta tiled entablature. Flattened, abstracted classical ornamentation for the frieze draws from traditional Meso-American or Native American designs, featuring stylized arrow and shield motifs. Arched semicircular fanlights surmount first-story windows, and bracketed iron lanterns flank the central entrance. The second-story fenestration is simpler, with rectangular windows and terra-cotta sills. Above the portico, the third-story windows are each framed with low-relief pilasters with stylized motifs and a terra-cotta- tiled stringcourse. The attic windows are capped by an additional tiled cornice and painted wood panels below a bracketed eave to the low-hipped roof clad with terra-cotta tiles. Framing the portico are two square, five-story Spanish towers that are simply treated at the lower stories, with curved corners and colossal low-relief pilasters. A stringcourse above the third story delineates a fourth-story belfry with a tall arched window at each side, flanked by low-relief pilasters and brackets. A terra-cotta cornice and a stucco parapet continue the classical stylization at the top of the tower walls. Through the mahogany entrance doors, the grand public lobby features the 1994 renovation's re-creation of the original post office lobby, which was adapted into the lobby of the U.S. Bankruptcy court. In keeping with the original fabric, the renovation architects worked from original shop drawings to restore missing historic elements. The terrazzo floor, including the Verde Antique marble and Lyonaisse Red marble bands and baseboards, and the Kasota Yellow-colored marble used for the wainscoting were artfully restored. Key features include the twin-globe sconces lining the walls, pendant lighting hanging from the coffered ceiling, and mahogany counters with bronze grilles above. Replicas of the original iron-cage elevators located in both towers are enclosed by the original gray marble stairs. Several pieces of 1930s Works Progress Administration art, with San Diego themes, were installed after the 1994 renovation. These include a ceramic sculpture by T.J. Dixon and James Nelson, titled The Immigrants, and two paintings on the third-floor, San Diego Harbor, by an unknown artist and San Diego Mural, by Belle Baranceanu. The ceremonial second-floor courtroom, where Judge Jacob Weinberger presided, features a 20-foot coffered ceiling with acanthus leaf detailing, pilasters, plastered paneling, oak paneling and marble counters for the judge and clerk benches, and the jury boxes. A new law library was added during the 1994 restoration, using materials and motifs that faithfully recall the original building details. Awards for the skillful restoration project included a prize from the California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In 1995-96, the building was named the Historical Office Building of the Year by the Building Owners and Managers Association.

The building was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and Louis A. Simon, and construction was completed in 1940. It formerly housed federal courts but is now used by Los Angeles Superior Court as the Spring Street Courthouse. The United States Court House initially housed court facilities for the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, until the District was redrawn in 1966. It thereafter functioned as a court house with judges from the United States District Court for the Central District of California. There is another federal court house in the Roybal Building in Downtown Los Angeles. In February 2006, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as U.S. Court House and Post Office. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012, as the site of Gonzalo Mendez et al v. Westminster School District of Orange County, et al, a major legal case in advancing the civil rights of Mexican-Americans, and a precursor to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Building history Built between 1937 and 1940 by the Federal Public Works Administration, it was the third federal building constructed in Los Angeles. The first, constructed between 1889 and 1892, housed the post office, U.S. District Court, and various federal agencies, but it soon proved inadequate. A larger structure was built between 1906 and 1910 at the corner of Main and Temple Streets. The population of Los Angeles grew rapidly in the early part of the twentieth century, and a larger building was needed to serve the courts and federal agencies. The second federal building was razed in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration to clear the site for the existing courthouse.General Services Administration page on the United States Court House (Los Angeles). Gilbert Stanley Underwood was selected to design the building as consulting architect to the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department. The actual plans were prepared by the Supervising Architect's Office. Underwood was acclaimed for his public architecture. His work includes lodges in National Parks, over two dozen post offices, a number of federal courthouses, and the magnificent United States Mint in San Francisco. The original plan specified a fifteen- story building. Even before construction began in May 1937, the Treasury Department realized two more floors would be needed. Congress did not appropriate the additional funding until the initial fifteen-story building was finished in January 1939. The building's top two stories and penthouse were added between April 1939 and March 1940. At the time of its completion, it was the largest federal building in the western United States. The post office, located on the ground and first floors, moved to another site in 1965. The expanding U.S. District Court then took over the space. The U.S. Court House has been the venue for a number of notable court cases, beginning in the 1940s with paternity cases against Clark Gable and Charlie Chaplin, and a breach of contract suit filed by Bette Davis against Warner Brothers. The House Un-American Activities Committee met in the building in 1947 to gather information on Hollywood personalities suspected of Communist involvement. In 1973 the federal government case against Daniel Ellsberg for leaking the \\"Pentagon Papers\\" was heard in the courthouse. In 2016, the Central District moved to the new First Street U.S. Courthouse, leaving the building's courtrooms empty.U.S General Services Administration. Extending the Legacy: GSA Historic Buildings Stewardship 2017. In 2018, the Los Angeles County Superior Court began leasing courtrooms in the United States Courthouse from the federal government for some of its civil and complex civil departments. This meant the building would again be used as a courthouse, but would now host a state court instead of a federal court. Other portions of the U.S. Court House remain in use by certain federal agencies, including the U.S. Attorney's office, and Probation and Pretrial Services. Architecture Located on a landscaped one-acre site bounded by Spring, Main, Temple and Aliso Streets in the Los Angeles Civic Center, the courthouse is a major example of Art Moderne architecture, characterized by its stepped rectangular massing and restrained use of exterior ornamentation. Dark gray granite with pink swirls is used for the steps, retaining walls, and walkway borders. Above a polished granite base, the seventeen-story steel-frame building is clad with a pale pink matte-glazed terra-cotta veneer. It is rectangular in plan, and steps back at the fourth and sixth stories. Above this rises a slab-like tower with a central two-story penthouse. The window openings are organized in vertical strips and set back from the facades. Sandblasted aluminum spandrels separate the paired double-hung windows. The roofs are flat and concealed by tall parapets. The main entrance, which faces Spring Street, is three stories high and recessed behind fluted columns. Each of the five entrance doorways consists of a pair of bronze doors capped by a projecting curved hood bearing a stylized eagle. Above each doorway, an elaborate aluminum grille extends to the full height of the bay. These grilles are decorated with flowers and the seals of five U.S. Government departments: State, Treasury, War, Justice, and Post Office. The opposite elevation, which faces Main Street, is similar, but has an additional lower story due to the slope of the site, and three entry bays rather than five. This elevation bears the seals of five additional federal departments: Navy, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor. The Spring Street and Main Street lobbies have retained most of their original finishes and furnishings. These include polychrome terrazzo floors, ornamental plaster ceilings, and ornate aluminum light fixtures. The Main Street lobby has an oval plan and has walls of Tennessee brown marble with golden Sienna travertine accents and engaged columns of black and gold marble from Montana. The floor contains an inlaid, eight-pointed starburst design, in red, yellow and green terrazzo with Cardiff green marble accents. Two statues stand at opposite ends of the lobby. \\"Law,\\" depicting a young woman with a tablet, is by Archibald Garner. The other titled \\"Young Lincoln\\" is by James Lee Hansen. The Spring Street lobby, which originally accommodated the post office, is larger, with a rectangular plan, and has a higher ceiling than the Main Street lobby. It is similar to the Spring Street lobby in its finishes. Four murals, originally installed in this lobby, were removed when the post office moved out. Two by Lucien Labaudt (Life on the Old Spanish and Mexican Ranchos, and Aeroydynamism) and one by Edward Biberman (Los Angeles Prehistoric Spanish Colonial) have been returned. Eight original courtrooms for the U.S. District Court are located on the second floor. Designed according to four different plans, they are all three stories in height and similarly finished with walnut wainscoting and plaster ceilings bordered by various geometric designs such as stars, waves, and squares. The courtroom of the United States Court of Appeals on the sixteenth floor is also finished in walnut, with a plaster ceiling, but has less elaborate detailing than the second-floor courtrooms. One of Los Angeles' most distinguished buildings, the United States Courthouse is directly on axis with, and complements, the massing of the twenty-eight-story Los Angeles City Hall (1926‚Äì1928), located across Temple Street to the south. It is also across the street from the fourteen-story Classical Revival-style Hall of Justice (1925).

It was built to house offices of the United States Customs Service. Building history Possessing an extraordinary natural harbor and one of the country's finest ports, San Francisco rapidly expanded during the nineteenth century. By the turn of the twentieth century, construction of the Panama Canal, which would dramatically shorten trade routes between the Atlantic and Pacific, had begun. City officials likely anticipated increased commerce and determined that a larger custom house was needed. In 1905, Eames and Young, a St. Louis architectural firm, won a national design competition for a new custom house. The firm was chosen under the auspices of the Tarsney Act (1890‚Äì1912), which allowed the Treasury Department to hire private architects rather than use only government designers. William S. Eames and Thomas Crane Young were the firm's principals. They designed the building in the Beaux Arts Classicism style, which was popular as part of the City Beautiful movement that sought to create more appealing urban centers. An earlier, more modest custom house, located on Battery Street between Jackson and Montgomery Streets, was demolished to make way for the present building. Ground was broken for the new custom house on January 28, 1906. Three months later, a devastating earthquake and subsequent fire decimated San Francisco. Because much of the city was being rebuilt simultaneously, there were severe labor and material shortages. As a result, construction of the custom house was not completed until 1911. The U.S. Custom House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, seismic and other upgrades were made from 1993 to 1997. While the building continues to serve many of its original purposes, the U.S. Customs Service is now the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. Architecture The U.S. Custom House is an excellent example of the Beaux Arts Classicism style of architecture, which is characterized by classical yet exuberant details. Many important federal buildings were designed in this style during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Some elements of Beaux Arts Classicism that are found on the U.S. Custom House include a symmetrical facade and articulated entrances that are highlighted with granite entablatures and carvings. The main entrance on Battery Street has a grouping of sculptural figures over the cornice. The imposing six-story building is faced in pale granite from Raymond, California. The concrete foundation of the building rests on timbers from the hull of the steamship Georgian, a vessel from San Francisco's gold rush days that was abandoned. The building essentially has a U-shaped plan that surrounds an oval, two-story pavilion that contains the post office and Custom Hall. Like many buildings with Beaux Arts Classicism features, the facade is divided into three horizontal zones. The lower zone is a rusticated granite base with deeply recessed joints that extends across the first story. The middle zone is characterized by smooth granite with windows topped with pediments and cartouches (decorative ovals). The upper zone is a recessed fifth story, where stylized eagle motifs separate the windows, and parapet. The interior of the U.S. Custom House contains a variety of high-quality finishes. Oak parquet floors are set in a herringbone pattern. Walls are paneled in oak with applied carved ornaments and inset with panels of green leather and decorated canvas. Other floors and walls are covered with marble. Ceilings are decorated with elaborate molded and painted plaster. The central lobby contains marble stairs and flooring, and a high ceiling with decorative plaster work. The monumental Custom Hall originally functioned as the most important operational and public space. The rich finishes include a marble floor and applied plaster ornamentation such as pilasters (attached columns). The walls and vaulted ceiling of the Custom Hall are finished with plaster and painted with a vibrant color scheme. Three historic skylights were restored to their original appearance as part of a renovation and restoration in 1997. Large, arched windows dominate the space. The curved end walls of the room incorporate two large murals painted in 1915 by Abraham Lincoln Cooper, who also painted murals at the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office in Columbus, Ohio. Building the Panama Canal commemorates the completion of the canal in 1915, and Allegory of San Francisco is a representation of the port city. The paintings were restored in 1938 and 1971. Another significant interior space is the Port Director's Office on the third floor. Originally used as an office suite by the Collector of Customs, the rooms have undergone only minor changes. Walls are paneled in oak with an ornamental frieze and a patterned cornice. The rooms contain stained oak parquet floors and a marble fireplace. The office was used as a set in the movie The Right Stuff in 1983. The U.S. Custom House retains a high degree of architectural integrity. Relatively few changes have been made to the building since its construction. In 1997, a renovation that increased seismic resistance and upgraded electrical, plumbing, and data systems while preserving the historic character of the building was completed. Original historic finishes were restored as part of the project.

Despite financial trouble, he graduated in 1770 and thus became Docteur-R√©gent, and married Marie Claude Leredde shortly after. He then started teaching a public course in chemistry in his own laboratory. Between 1771 and 1773, Bucquet published a manual of chemistry, first on mineral then on vegetal chemistry, destined for the use of beginners in the science who need a coherent overview of the different processes and products in use.Bucquet, (1771) Introduction √† l'√©tude du r√®gne mineral This manual was intended for people attending his course but also for those who could not. Bucquet's public course carried out for several years, and was mentioned in the Journal de M√©decine.Journal de m√©decine, de chirurgie et de pharmacie, Volume 34, 1770, p. 570. In 1775, Bucquet became professor of pharmacy at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris, and the next year, following the death of Augustin Roux, he took the chair of chemistry at the Faculty. He became part of the French Academy of Sciences as a chemist in 1777. During his years at the Academy, he published a few works of chemical analysis, including one in collaboration with the duke of La Rochefoucauld. He eventually acquired the laboratory in rue Jacob which used to belong to the chemist Rouelle and carried out his public courses there. He continued giving public courses until 1779, at which point he became to ill to continue. He was known to be a very good teacher and many attended his courses. He died of his disease in 1780. His most famous pupil was Antoine-Fran√ßois Fourcroy who later carried on Bucquet's work on natural history. Collaboration with Lavoisier In 1777, Bucquet worked with Antoine Lavoisier at his residence of the Arsenal, performed many fundamental experiments of chemistry, with the aim of checking if there results which were widely used in chemistry, could still be considered reliable. Lavoisier had the financial means and necessary laboratory equipment to perform such a task and Bucquet brought his many years of experience in public demonstration and laboratory expertise. Together, they published 26 memoirs at the Academy of Sciences.Kim, Mi Gyung. (2003) Affinity, that Elusive Dream: A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution.

The name of the range has been in use for at least 100 years, though it has been called the \\"Sierra del Ojo\\" and the \\"Sonoyta Mountains\\" on some older maps. A map created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers around 1920 labeled the range the \\"Quitovaquita Mountains.\\" This is in reference to Quitobaquito Springs, which lie approximately nine miles southeast of the range in what are now called the Quitobaquito Hills.

These pools are in contrast to \\"Agua Salada,\\" which is located further downstream on the river and yields only highly mineralized and brackish water. The range also contains a small spring on its southern slope that also bears the name Agua Dulce, though it is likely that the range is named for the pools on the river rather than the spring, since the pools played prominently in the history of the area whereas the spring is small and well away from the historical Sonoyta River travel corridor.Broyles, Bill, Luke Evans, Richard Stephen Felger, and Gary Nabhan. 2007.

Felger, editors. University of Utah Press. The range is home to a number of abandoned mines, most notably the Papago Mine and the Legal Tender Mine, which were worked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Papago Well was drilled nearby during the same period to provide water to the mines.Bryan, Kirk. 1925. The Papago Country, Arizona: A Geographic, Geologic, and Hydrologic Reconnaissance with a Guide to Desert Watering Places. Water Supply Paper No. 499. United States Geological Survey. Washington, D.C. Later the well was used to provide water to cattle that grazed in the area, and now the windmill pumps water to a guzzler for wildlife. The Davidson Canyon area and the associated bajada to the south of the range contain the northernmost populations of senita cactus (Pachycereus schottii). This columnar cactus is very common further south in Mexico, but in the United States it is restricted to small areas of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and this isolated population in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge.

The company is well known for its annual Summerworks festival each May/June. Throughout its history, the company has produced work by Gregory Moss, Madeleine George, Kristin Newbom, Wallace Shawn, Mac Wellman, Charles Mee, Sarah Ruhl, Adam Bock, Gina Gionfriddo, Rinne Groff, Sheila Callaghan, Lisa D'Amour, Anne Washburn, Sigrid Gilmer, Erin Courtney, Karl Gajdusek, Clare Barron, Jaclyn Backhaus, Tanya Saracho, Will Arbery, Heidi Schreck and others. In many cases these productions were the writers first professional and/or first New York production. The company also produces outside of Summerworks, commissions and develops a number of plays each season, and runs various programs for early- career theater artists. The New York Times's Ben Brantley has praised the company, saying \\"To your cherished list of warm-weather city pleasures, you should think about adding Summerworks. Now 23 years old, this staple of the East Village culturescape‚Ä¶allows you to say you knew certain rising playwrights before your friends did.\\" New York Times critic Jesse Green has added \\"A perfect summer show, a trick Clubbed Thumb seems to have mastered. The Summerworks home at the Wild Project in the East Village, with its garage- door entry open to the street, makes seeing the plays seem like a friendly invitation instead of a cultural duty.\\" And critic Helen Shaw has called Clubbed Thumb's Summerworks \\"one of the best ways to see which local playwrights have their fingers on the pulse.\\"  Funny, Strange, Provocative  In 2007, Clubbed Thumb released a volume of produced plays, Funny, Strange, Provocative: Seven Plays from Clubbed Thumb,http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=1131 published through Playscripts, Inc. and edited by Erin Detrick and Producing Artistic Director Maria Striar, which is widely sold and is taught in theater programs across the country. A second anthology is due to release in 2020.  What the Constitution Means to Me  In 2017, Clubbed Thumb developed and produced the world premiere of Heidi Schreck's What the Constitution Means to Me in partnership with True Love Productions, as part of Clubbed Thumb's annual Summerworks festival at the 89-seat Wild Project in New York's East Village, featuring Heidi, Danny Wolohan and Rosdely Ciprian. It ran for 11 sold-out performances. The production went on to have a run at Berkeley Rep, followed by an Off-Broadway run at New York Theatre Workshop where it was met with a great deal of enthusiasm. In 2019 the production transferred to a Broadway run at the Helen Hayes Theater, for which it was nominated for two Tony Awards (including Best Play and Best Actress), and well as winning a number of other accolades and being named a Pulitzer Prize finalist.  Oral History of Clubbed Thumb  Clubbed Thumb‚Äôs first production was dragged fitfully to the stage by the four members of a semi-regular bridge game in the snowbound winter of 1996: Meg MacCary, Maria Striar, Arne Jokela (Joe), and Jay Worthington. The House of Candles (fondly remembered as the ‚ÄòHouse of Firetraps‚Äô) was rented, roles were divvied up (Meg starring, Maria directing, Joe and Jay designing, as it turned out), dozens of friends were enlisted, and what would become Clubbed Thumb‚Äôs provocative and influential Summerworks series was born. Grasping for a name to (more or less) fill in paperwork, without consideration of longevity and with no concept of the allusions, Meg pulled a book of palmistry off Maria‚Äôs shelf, fatefully flipping to a goofy sketch of what looked to be a toe labeled, ‚Äúclubbed thumb‚Äù‚Ä¶ fatefully because in this Victorian pseudo-science (as Clubbed Thumb fans will find appropriate), a clubbed thumb is defined as a digit missing the phalange that represents Reason! Further, possessors of a clubbed thumb are said to be willful and passionate (it has even been referred to as ‚Äúthe murderer‚Äôs thumb‚Äù‚Ä¶ draw your own conclusions). It was a gleefully arbitrary act of naming, but its strange suggestiveness has proved an excellent match for Clubbed Thumb‚Äôs theatrical sensibility. Summerworks‚Äô original structure was similarly born of somewhat arbitrary limitations: The House of Candles was rented for a month, but Clubbed Thumb‚Äôs first play was short and the run limited by Actors‚Äô Equity to sixteen performances. So colleagues and former classmates were asked if they had anything they‚Äôd like to show. Thus, Summerworks. Plural. (Seven shows, in fact, went up that first summer.) To maximize the use of the rental, time slots at 8pm, 10pm, and occasionally midnight were scheduled. Thus, the 90-minute play limit ‚Äì half-an-hour for set change. Clubbed Thumb‚Äôs institutional and seasonal formation also developed ad hoc, ever-adapting to the artistic needs of the work at hand. (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always rearranging our pile of nickels,‚Äù Maria likes to joke.) This flexibility served: Summerworks swiftly established its reputation as a new-play series with an emphasis on formally innovative (even specifically difficult) structures and fully dimensional roles for actors of both genders. Meg and Maria quickly fell into co-directorial roles. In addition to the four founders, major contributions were made by Erich Strom (2000-2002) and Ian Helfer (2000-2003) to the board and creative team, as well as staff members from over the years: Michael Levinton (2004 - 2007; 2018 - Present), Diana Konopka (2006 - 2011), Nora DeVeau-Rosen (2011 - 2014) and Sarah McLellan (2014 - 2018). As mentioned above, Meg and Maria shared responsibilities as co-directors from 1996-2009. Meg decided to move on from her full-time duties with Clubbed Thumb in 2009 to fully commit to acting. Having paused his original professional trajectory for Clubbed Thumb, Jay relinquished his day- to-day involvement to return to the law in 2003. Joe (Arne) carried on in a part-time capacity until 2009, when he officially joined the board, eventually stepping off the board in 2018. Clubbed Thumb is currently run by Producing Artistic Director Maria Striar, Associate Artistic Director Michael Bulger and Advancement Director Quinn Metal Corbin. Michael Levinton serves as a part- time General Manager. Clubbed Thumb was the inaugural Resident Company at Playwrights Horizons beginning in 2014. Clubbed Thumb remains purposely, exuberantly in flux, continually searching for the present way to best serve the work and its broad and ever-growing family of artists. This history was compiled and written by playwright Frank Boudreaux.  Awards & Recognition  Accolades awarded Clubbed Thumb's alumni artists include the Pulitzer short- list, Tony, MacArthur, Steinberg, Kesselring, Relentless Theater Award, as well as numerous Susan Smith Blackburn, Guggenheim, Whiting and Obie Awards. In 2010, Producing Artistic Director Maria Striar was honored at the inaugural Lilly Awards with the Margo Jones Award for Artistic Directorship, citing her efforts as a ‚Äúfierce champion of new works and new writers... who has helped launch and/or develop the careers‚Äù of scores of playwrights, especially women. In 2013, Clubbed Thumb received its 5th Obie Award, this time the Ross Wetzsteon Award for sustained artistic excellence. In 2019, Clubbed Thumb made their Broadway debut and received a Tony Award nomination for What the Constitution Means to Me, which originated in Summerworks 2017.

It is managed by the General Services Administration. History The building was designed by William Pereira, who developed a stepped pyramid silhouette that is rare in American architecture. The unusual form references ziggurats, ancient Mesopotamian temples. The building was originally constructed in 1968 for North American Aviation, a defense and aerospace industries manufacturer, to house the company's corporate offices on the top floors and hold an electronics manufacturing plant on the bottom two floors. The building is located in the heart of a shallow valley surrounded by the San Joaquin Hills. The site was chosen in part because, in the mid 1960s, it was a very desolate and quiet area of southern Orange County, and North American Aviation wanted an area that would be private and secure. Construction took nearly three years, and in 1971 the building was completed. The building's construction came at a transformative time in the defense industry: In the midst of the project, North American Aviation merged with Rockwell International, a manufacturing conglomerate that worked in the defense and space industries. However, Rockwell never occupied the building. There are a couple of stories as to why this happened: The more common story is that as the Vietnam War wound down, Rockwell's defense contract with the federal government fell through, leaving the company with an impressive structure with no work for it to do. The other story is more dramatic. William ‚ÄúArt‚Äù Morris, a corporate architect for North American, who contributed to the building's design, told the Orange County Register in 1993 that the building was deemed too fanciful for its line of work. ‚ÄúThe chairman of the board came to take a tour,‚Äù Morris said of a 1969 visit to the building. ‚ÄúHe got to the fourth floor and he said one thing, a short sentence: ‚ÄòThis is far too nice for an electronics firm.‚Äô And everything came to a screeching halt.‚Äù In any case, the building, which was designed to accommodate 7,000 aerospace employees, sat empty for several years. Rockwell eventually offered to trade the building to the United States government in exchange for three surplus government facilities of equal value located near Los Angeles International Airport. In 1974, GSA assumed control of the building. In 1978, the United States Congress passed a bill to rename the building in honor of Congressman Chester E. \\"Chet\\" Holifield,H.R.12138 -- A bill to name a certain Federal building in Laguna Niguel, California, the \\"Chet Holifield Building\\". who had represented California's 19th District from 1943 to 1974. The new name, though, didn't bring new tenants, and much of the building remained empty for the next decade. After an attempted sale in the 1980s didn't come to fruition, the federal government finally decided to keep the building. Today, the building's primary tenants are the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Internal Revenue Service. Holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration for the Pacific region were once located in the building as well but have since been relocated to Perris, California. Architecture Perhaps innovative for its time, the building has more recently been described as \\"appearing to be one part government building and two parts apocalyptic stronghold.\\" and as a \\"white elephant.\\" https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/09/the-ziggurat-how-a-white-elephant- became-a-county-landmark/ The sculptural Chet Holifield Federal Building is skillfully executed in a stepped pyramidal form that has a similar appearance to ancient ziggurats. Modern master architect William L. Pereira developed the unified design that is unparalleled in the federal government. A large portion of the more than one million square foot building is below grade, effectively diminishing the overall mass. It is located on a parcel of land in Laguna Niguel, California, between Los Angeles and San Diego, and approximately from the Pacific coastline. The building has seven tiers and is constructed of angled, painted, pre-cast concrete panels with reticulation, a textured finish that displays curvilinear forms. The building displays some characteristics of the Brutalist style of Modern architecture, which is distinguished by weighty, massive forms; rough, exposed concrete surfaces; broad, expansive wall planes; and recessed windows. The building has a concrete frame and the lateral force- resisting system consists of concrete shearwalls and single-level concrete moment frames. It was constructed on spread footings and caissons. Anodized aluminum windows, which are separated by slanting concrete walls with triangular forms, are recessed between the horizontal levels. Evenly spaced windows provide a consistent rhythm to the symmetrical building, which has a sprawling horizontal emphasis. The top tier of the building has a large flat roof with attached protruding vertical elements, providing additional texture to the structure. The building also contains large amounts of asbestos that has been detected numerous times over the years, particularly during a water main break in March 2013. The east entrance is trapezoidal in form, referencing the overall shape of the building. A moat of smooth rocks surrounds the building on three sides, alluding to the idea that the massive structure is a modern-day fortress. A formal, classically inspired, symmetrical plaza is located outside of the main entrance. Grass panels, trees, landscaped beds, and planters greet visitors and provide contrast to the massive concrete structure. When the site was developed, more than 2,500 trees and 6,500 shrubs were included in the initial landscape plan. Concrete benches echo the materials and form of the building. In the lobby, both escalators and elevators provide high-speed vertical movement. Pereira's efficient interior circulation system allowed for a maximum travel time of approximately five minutes between any two points in the building. Select walls are covered in wood paneling and some areas contain wooden slat ceilings, several of which are coffered. Vinyl tile and carpet cover the floors. Portions of the interior were redesigned by GSA to accommodate increased office space. Other buildings on the site include a maintenance warehouse; 500,000-gallon water tank that services the fire protection system; energy plant, cooling tower; a 1,000,000-gallon thermal energy storage tank; and security buildings. A heliport is located on the site and additional landscaped areas are found throughout the large parcel. When constructed, the complex had 6,200 parking spaces, which radiate diagonally along the building axes, in anticipation of the thousands of employees that were to occupy the facility. In 2003, state-of-the-art upgrades and modifications to the roofing were completed as part of an energy-saving plan that saves $650,000 per year in utility costs. Elevators, critical to efficient circulation in the building, were upgraded in 2005. ASBESTOS: No extensive remediation has been undertaken by GSA to date despite there being known to be large amounts of asbestos contained above the drop ceiling tiles, many of which had been damaged and/or missing over the years, observed by most during the March 2013 burst water pipe where employees continued to work in affected areas despite oftentimes finding white dust on their desks upon returning to work in the morning. At that point in time employees were not aware/ made aware of asbestos contamination by management or anyone else until April, 2013. Since wider broadcast of asbestos contamination post March, 2013 yearly air sample tests are conducted and as of February 2018 Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) Inspection surveys were sent out in attempts to contact former and current employees in what appears to be the first time compiling data on possible asbestos related illnesses/ deaths on current/ former building staff members.

The 1936 Neoclassical style building, designed by Arthur Brown, Jr., is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing property to the San Francisco Civic Center Historic District, which is a National Historic Landmark. Building In 1906, a major earthquake decimated San Francisco and destroyed more than 28,000 buildings, many as a result of subsequent fires. As the city rebuilt, it adopted a plan for a civic center, first developed in 1899 by English architect B.J.S. Cahill, to consolidate government buildings in a central location. The last building completed for the San Francisco Civic Center, the Federal Building was a critical component of the seven-building complex that included government buildings, a library, and an opera house. The Civic Center design incorporates City Beautiful planning, a concept that relies on Beaux Arts design principles and classically inspired, monumental architecture. San Francisco's Civic Center is one of the nation's most successful examples of the City Beautiful movement.Federal Building, San Francisco, CA, from the General Services Administration. In 1927, the government allocated $2.5 million for the Federal Building's design and construction, although final costs reached a total of $3 million. San Francisco city officials donated a site in 1930. Architect Arthur Brown, Jr. designed the building, which was constructed between 1934 and 1936, under the auspices of Supervising Architect of the Treasury Louis A. Simon. Brown studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the world's preeminent architectural school, graduating in 1901. He was the sole architect of the Federal Building, as well as the Opera House and Veterans Building, both significant components of the Civic Center. Brown and his partner John Bakewell, Jr. designed City Hall, a 1915 Beaux Arts architectural masterpiece. Also located within the Civic Center, the City Hall commission established the partners' careers. In 1975, construction commenced on United Nations Plaza, designed by noted landscape architect Lawrence Halprin and located next to the Federal Building. The one-acre pedestrian area was named to honor the establishment of the U.N., which occurred in the Veterans Building on June 26, 1945. The Federal Building is a contributing element to the San Francisco Civic Center, which the Secretary of the Interior designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The building was vacated in 2007 after the new federal building was constructed in San Francisco. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) took over the building in 2013 after its renovation. Architecture The Federal Building is an excellent example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture, displaying style-defining features such as distinct horizontal divisions, a rusticated base, and classical ornamentation including columns on the exterior elevations. The building occupies the block bounded by United Nations Plaza, and Hyde, McAllister, and Leavenworth streets. It has a rectangular footprint with an interior courtyard that allows natural light into the interior. The six-story steel frame is encased in fireproof concrete with concrete flooring and roof slabs, features that officials and architects agreed were important precautions after the fires resulting from the 1906 earthquake. The street elevation walls are constructed of brick but faced with granite, with the exception of a section of the McAllister Street elevation, which is faced in terra cotta. At the first two stories, the granite is rusticated to articulate the base of the building. The upper stories of the south facade, which faces United Nations Plaza, are covered with smooth-faced granite and dominated by a colonnade of detached two-story Doric columns that are aligned with Doric pilasters on the building. A classical balustrade supports the railing between the columns. Fenestration consists primarily of regularly spaced rectangular windows with multi-pane configurations. The attic story is set back from the wall plane of the building and is surrounded by a classical balustrade and topped by a molded cornice. A corner door The main entrance, consisting of three arched openings, is located at the center of the south elevation. The central arch is topped by a keystone that contains a medallion with a carved shield motif, while the flanking arches each are topped by a medallion featuring an eagle holding olive branches. Secondary entrances are located on the southeast and southwest corners of the building, where the meeting points of the exterior walls have been designed as concave arc configurations. Round arches with ornate medallions placed on the keystones also mark these entrances, and Doric porticos are located above the second story of the corners. Male and female mascarons (carved faces) adorn the exterior. The carvings sport different horticulturally themed headpieces, including corn, wheat, cat tails, and oak leaves. The hipped roof is covered with light grey lead-coated copper. The main entrance vestibule and first-floor lobby are the most grand and richly detailed interior spaces in the building. The terrazzo flooring features a marble border. Grey marble wainscot, rising to a height of more than twenty- seven feet, covers the walls. Above the wainscot, the cast-stone walls spring into the barrel vaulted ceiling, which features molded hexagonal, rectangular, and diamond-shaped decorative coffers and shell motifs. A detailed cornice and doorway surmounted with a triangular pediment add to the classically inspired design of the entry spaces. Cast-stone arches separate the first-floor elevator lobby from the corridors. The original bronze elevator doors remain and bronze is also used on other historic elements of the elevator lobby, including a mailbox, clocks, telephone booths, and building directory and bulletin board frames. The lobby leads to an internal courtyard that is open to the sky. Walkways are interspersed with trees, shrubbery, and groundcover plantings. Several significant interior spaces remain intact. The former Board Room for the U.S. Navy is located on the second floor. Paneled wainscot covers the lower portions of walls, while the upper areas are plaster. The former office of the General Inspector, Supply Corps is a rectangular room with rounded corners. Double-leaf French doors admit natural light and lead to an exterior balcony. A wood and plaster cornice tops the walls. The former Collector of Internal Revenue office contains a similar cornice and paneled wood wainscot covers the walls. Another important interior space is the former naval Commandant's Suite, a circular ceremonial room, twenty feet in diameter, with adjacent offices, restroom, dressing room, and waiting room. The parquet oak floor contains a centrally placed U.S. Navy seal. An original fireplace with an ornate verde antique marble Rococo-style mantel remains in the room.  History  AIDS/ARC Vigil in 1985 In 1977, after frustration that the secretary of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare had delayed signing regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for four years, disability rights protestors marched to this federal building and began a sit-in that became a 26-day occupation. This 504 Sit-in was led by Judith Heumann and organized by Kitty Cone. More than 150 demonstrators refused to disband; this action was the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. Joseph Califano signed the regulations on April 28, 1977. In 1985, when the renamed United States Department of Health and Human Services was in this building, protestors with AIDS and AIDS-related complex chained themselves to the door of the building on October 27, to demand that the U.S. government increase funding for AIDS-related research, care, and social services. They stayed for weeks and began the AIDS/ARC Vigil, which was an encampment that stayed for ten years (until 1995). In November 1985, activist Cleve Jones organized a candlelight march in remembrance of the 1978 assassinations of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, and he asked people to write the names of loved ones lost to AIDS- related causes on signs. At the end of the march, they taped the signs to the walls of this federal building. The signs taped to the building looked like a patchwork quilt to Jones, and he was inspired to start the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt with several collaborators.

Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a historic building on Stout Street in downtown Denver, Colorado, which serves as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Completed in 1965, the building was renamed for Colorado Congressman Byron G. Rogers in 1984. In 1996 and 1997, the criminal case against bomber Timothy McVeigh was conducted there. Additionally, the federal building is home to 11 federal agencies, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office's new Rocky Mountain Regional location that opened on June 30, 2014. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Building history In the years following World War II, the population of Denver, Colorado, grew rapidly as numerous federal agencies located to the city. The existing federal building could no longer accommodate growing space needs, and the government began planning for a new complex to house the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 1959, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) selected the accomplished Denver architectural firm James Sudler Associates as the lead designer, with another skilled Denver firm, Fisher & Davis, assisting. James Sudler designed numerous Modern buildings in the Denver area, including the exuberant Church of the Risen Christ and the Denver Art Museum (with Gio Ponti). In 1961, the federal government allotted $687,000 to purchase the downtown Denver site, bound by Champa, Stout, Nineteenth, and Twentieth streets, adjacent to the existing post office and custom house. Officials appropriated an additional $20 million in 1962 for the construction of the complex, with groundbreaking occurring the same year. The first occupants moved into the building in 1965. In 1984, the complex was named to honor Byron G. Rogers (1900-1983), who represented Colorado in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1951 to 1971. Rogers was instrumental in securing the original funds for the courthouse. The trial of Timothy McVeigh, the bomber responsible for the 1995 attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, was held at the courthouse in 1996 and 1997. To find an impartial jury, the court moved the case to Denver, where McVeigh was tried and convicted. In 1999, GSA initiated alterations to the entrance to accommodate security needs. Local preservationists asked GSA to consider the potential significance of the complex before commencing work that would alter character-defining features. As a result, GSA developed a sensitive design that retained these important elements. The unexpected public interest led GSA to commission a study to better understand the architecture and context of buildings from this era. In 2003, GSA published Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism: GSA Buildings of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. The publication has received several awards and strengthened GSA's reputation as a leader in the preservation field. Architecture The courthouse consists of three distinct components: an 18-story office tower, a low courthouse, and a landscaped plaza. This three-part design combination was typical of Modern architecture and is perhaps best exemplified by the United Nations Headquarters complex in New York. Sudler's design for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is an excellent example of Formalism, a style of Modern architecture that incorporates flat rooflines, columnar supports, symmetry, high-quality materials, and works of art. The tall office building has an unusual, angular footprint. While the center sections measure 103 feet in width, the ends are only 80 feet wide. The street level is clad in white marble panels, as are the narrow unfenestrated elevations of the building. Upper stories of the primary elevations exhibit an alternating rhythm of beige pre-cast concrete panels and projecting windows. Public spaces on the interior have marble wainscoting and terrazzo floors with bronze dividers. The low, rectangular courthouse derives its form from two nearby federal buildings that inspired Sudler: the 1931 U.S. Custom House and the 1916 Byron R. White United States Courthouse (the former main post office). Sudler's design alludes to earlier classical architecture in scale, form, and color of materials. The building is clad primarily in pre-cast aggregate stone panels with a light tan color. On the Champa Street elevation, the panels have profiles that evoke the footprint and windows of the office tower. White marble is visible in bands at the top and bottom of the courthouse. Windows are oriented vertically and in pairs, running in tall bands divided by thin strips of marble. The Stout Street elevation features a metal art screen, a common element of Formalism, over large windows; the screen also serves to control direct sunlight on the interior. Like the office tower, interior public spaces of the courthouse have marble wainscoting and terrazzo floors. The courtroom walls are finished in panels of alternating polished light and dark woods with prominent grain patterns. Public art is a critical component of the complex. GSA allotted $50,000 of the original construction budget for works of art. Pieces include the large bronze Great Seal of the United States and a stylized mahogany carving called Justice, Freedom, and the Release from Bondage, both by Denver sculptor William Joseph. A bronze bas-relief art column entitled Federal Services by Edgar Britton is located within the landscaped plaza. The column resembles a totem pole and contains carvings inspired by Native American art. The cylinder originally acted as a canopy support, but was moved when the entrance was reconfigured. In 2006, Jim Campbell created a dynamic light installation along the Champa Street elevation, with a companion piece in the main lobby. In 1999, GSA initiated a $1.65 million project as part of its First Impressions program. The plaza and entrance configuration were modified to improve security screening and make the facility more efficient and welcoming to employees and visitors. The inviting new plaza skillfully and unobtrusively incorporates security features as well as elements of the architects' design that were never constructed. The existing covered walkway, or canopy, was retained and a new glass pavilion was added at the convergence of the office tower and the courthouse to facilitate security screening. New lighting and a restored water feature were also included in the design. The project received a Standing Ovation Award from Historic Denver, Inc., in 2001 and a 2006 Honor Award from the Denver Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The low courthouse building underwent a full modernization between 2002 and 2006. The project included upgrades to mechanical systems, reconfiguration of interior spaces, and asbestos abatement.

It is a courthouse for the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Building history The Federal Building and U.S. Custom House is part of a complex of four federal buildings located in close proximity to each other in downtown Denver, the others being the Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, the Byron White U.S. Courthouse, and the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse. The federal government acquired the site, which was previously home to the East Denver High School, in three parcels between 1928 and 1930 for just under $300,000. The building replaced Denver's overcrowded 1892 custom house, located at another location in the city. Designs for the original portion of the building, completed in 1931, came from the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, which at that time was led by James A. Wetmore. Both this building and the nearby Byron White U.S. Courthouse are clad in the same Colorado Yule marble used in the Lincoln Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, D.C. Indiana limestone was originally planned for cladding the building, and would have been less expensive. However, members of Congress from Colorado successfully argued for use of local materials. The building was completed in May 1931 at a total cost of $1,260,000. A 1937 addition nearly doubled the size of the building. Denver architects Temple Hoyne Buell and G. Meredith Musick designed the addition. The cladding material was once again controversial. In this case, Colorado Yule marble was substituted for Georgia marble after local officials successfully argued that the materials of the original building and addition should match, and that the revenue from the marble purchase should benefit Colorado. Though it housed various federal agencies, the building's primary occupant was the U.S. Customs Service. Its revenues averaged $500,000 per year, and eventually climbed to $1,400,000 in 1957. In need of more space, the Customs Service moved to the former Stapleton Airport in 1957. The major building tenant is now the bankruptcy court. The building has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. During the 1960s and 1970s, protesters often used the U.S. Courthouse plaza across the street. In 1975, a bomb exploded in a first floor men's room of the building, but there was no significant structural damage. A group calling themselves the Continental Revolutionary Army took credit for the bombing. Architecture The five-story Federal Building and U.S. Custom House is a skillfully executed example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture. The arched first floor window and door openings, detailed cornices, emphasis on the horizontal elements, and stately overall appearance of the building are all characteristic of this architectural style. It has a steel frame on poured concrete footings and a flat composite roof. The base is clad in granite, as are the stairs leading to the entry doors. The remainder of the Nineteenth, Stout, and California street elevations of the building are clad in smooth- rubbed, coarse cut Colorado Yule marble with terra-cotta ornamentation. The fifth floor, which is recessed eight feet, is clad in brick, as are the courtyard-facing elevations of the building. Marble quoins (cornerstones) highlight the transition from marble to brick facade. Terracotta is used for a belt course above the first floor, cornices, and spandrels between the windows of the second and third, and third and fourth stories. Decorative terra cotta swags are located above the ornamental grillwork that flanks the main entry door. The symmetrical plan is E-shaped with a semi-enclosed courtyard at the north end. The windows are spaced evenly and are designed to create a balanced overall look for the building. The tops of the first floor windows and the main entry doorway are arched. Spandrels that separate the second, third, and fourth story windows feature eagles and shields, emphasizing the federal use of the building. The primary entrance is on Nineteenth Street at the midpoint of the south elevation, and a penthouse is located above this central point that rises twenty feet above the parapet coping (decorative capping at the top of the wall). The centered main entry is the focal point of the exterior. In 1972, the original bronze entry doors were removed and replaced with aluminum doors. A terracotta eagle tops a semicircular fanlight above the doorway. Tuscan order columns flanking the entrance support an entablature inscribed with the name of the building and capped by a decorative cartouche. In the lobby, polished Colorado Yule marble surrounds the doors leading from the vestibule and clads the lower portion of the walls on either side of those doors. It also surrounds the elevators and extends for several feet on either side of the elevators, covering the lower portion of the walls. Only one of the light fixtures, which have oval etched-glass domes suspended within brass frameworks and hanging from the ceiling via brass chains, is original; the others were replicated. The bronze and leaded glass doors between the vestibule and the lobby were recently restored. Glass panes allow light to flood the lobby and the bronze surrounds and details reinforce the stately appearance of the building. There are staircases with marble treads at each end of the corridors leading off of the lobby. The layout of each floor of the building is identical, with offices lining each corridor. The wainscoting and baseboards are all marble, as are the bathroom partitions in the 1931 portion of the building. The 1937 addition resulted in extensions to each side of the building that nearly doubled the area and made the central courtyard less visible from the street. Additional penthouses were added at the California and Stout Street ends of the building to house the upper portions of the elevator shafts. The corridors and lobby areas are largely intact, though the offices were modified.

Development and design In 1917, the British Royal Aircraft Factory started design of a night fighter development of its F.E.9, the F.E.12. This used the tailbooms, undercarriage and wing centre-sections of the F.E.9, combining them with new, three-bay outer wings and a larger tailplane. It was to be armed with a shell firing gun and equipped with two searchlights.Bruce 1968, pp. 62‚Äì63. The design was revised to produce the N.E.1 (for Night-flying Experimental), with revised wings, new tailbooms and a new, wide track, undercarriage.Bruce 1968, p. 63. The first prototype N.E.1 flew on 8 September 1917.Bruce 1968, p. 64.

He was regarded as the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1889. Breeding He was bred by Nevadan Theodore Winters at his Rancho del Rio breeding farm near Sacramento, California where he had both El Rio Rey's important sire, Norfolk and his dam, Marian. The outstanding mare of her era in the American West, Marian (1871‚Äì1893) was also the dam of Yo Tambien as a result of Theodore Winters mating her to his stallion, Joe Hooker. El Rio Rey was a full brother to the good racehorse, Emperor of Norfolk and Czar as well as six other horses.Lowe, Bruce, Breeding Racehorses by the Figure System, Libra Books, Canberra, 1977, These colts were inbred to Glencoe in the third and fourth (3m x 4f) generation.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software Racing record El Rio Rey's race conditioning was supervised by the head of the Theodore Winters racing stable, Alfred H. Estell, as well as trainer William H. McCormick. As a two-year-old racing in 1889, El Rio Rey competed at racetracks in Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri before heading to New York City. The publicity surrounding his racing abilities as a full brother to the great Emperor of Norfolk drew a huge crowd to Morris Park Racecourse to see him win the August 25 Great Eclipse Stakes. On the same track, he then won the inaugural running of the six furlong (1,200 meters) White Plains Handicap on August 31, against a field of 14 horses in track record time while carrying 126 pounds (57 kilograms). The next day's issue of The New York Times declared him the best two-year-old in the country, stating that horsemen consider him \\"the greatest colt ever foaled.\\" El Rio Rey followed up with another win in September's Prospect Stakes at the Gravesend Race Track. The colt ended his two-year-old campaign undefeated, having won all seven starts. In 1890, El Rio Rey was scheduled to run, but breathing problems led to the belief that he was a roarer, and his career eventually ended without him making a start at age three. Retirement Later in 1890, Theodore Winters sold his California properties to return to Nevada after he had been selected as the Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of Nevada. He relocated his breeding operations to his Rancho del Sierra in Nevada's Washoe Valley with El Rio Rey and Joe Hooker as his main stallions. El Rio Rey sired some Californian race winners.

He was awarded the medal for rescuing his crewmates during the sinking of his ship, the , in the Mississippi River. Under heavy fire from a Confederate artillery battery, Jenkins and three other men swam back and forth between the riverbank and the sinking ship, helping crewmen who could not swim reach shore. The four men then towed a small boat, carrying wounded sailors and the ship's commander, to the safety of Union forces. Biography Jenkins was born in Australia in 1831, and later immigrated to the United States, enlisting in the US Navy from New York in 1861.http://www.mohhsus.com/lost-to-history During the Civil War, Jenkins served as a seaman on the ironclad USS Cincinnati. On May 27, 1863, during the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, the Cincinnati was ordered to steam down the Mississippi River and destroy two Confederate artillery guns which were impeding the advance of General William Tecumseh Sherman's right flank. Between the Cincinnati and the two guns was a Confederate eleven-piece heavy artillery battery which, from its position atop a bluff, had command over that entire stretch of the river. The Union forces had been aware of the battery, but, shortly before the Cincinnati received its orders, the battery had disappeared and was assumed to have been moved elsewhere. Unbeknown to them, the battery's guns had been removed from view by simply lowering them from their carriages, both to protect them from the fire of ships on the river and to deceive the Union forces. The commander of the battery had discovered the Union signal code, and when he intercepted a message describing the Cincinnati's mission, he had the guns re-assembled during the night and concealed them in brush. On the morning of May 27, the Cincinnati headed downstream and reached its target, the two artillery guns. Just as it fired its first shots, the hidden battery on the bluff also opened fire, completely surprising the Union ship. The first Confederate shell scored a direct hit, passing through Cincinnati's magazine and exiting through the bottom of the ship. Another shell disabled the ship's steering mechanism. The Cincinnati's own guns could not be elevated enough to return fire on the high battery. Knowing his ship was doomed, the commander, Lieutenant George M. Bache, headed the Cincinnati full-steam back up the river in search of a place on which to beach the ship. A suitable spot being found, the Cincinnati was run aground, a hawser tied to a tree, and gangplank laid out. Before the men could evacuate, the hawser came loose and the ship slipped from the bank out into the river, where it began to sink in about of water. Many of the crew, including the commander, could not swim; those who could, including Jenkins, began to abandon ship. Still under intense fire, Jenkins and three others, Landsman Thomas E. Corcoran, Boatswain's Mate Henry Dow, and Seaman Martin McHugh, swam back and forth, helping their crewmates to shore. They then reboarded the Cincinnati, hastily repaired a small boat which had been damaged by the Confederate fire, and loaded it with men who were too badly wounded to be dragged through the water. After Lieutenant Bache also climbed into the boat, they towed it to the safety of a Union flotilla. For these actions, Jenkins was awarded the Medal of Honor a month and a half later, on July 10, 1863. The other three swimmers, Corcoran, Dow, and McHugh, and two more Cincinnati crewmen also received the medal for their part in the action. He was medically discharged on Christmas Day, 1863. On August 21, 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) donated Jenkins' medal to the Congressional Medal of Honor Museum, located on the museum ship at Patriot's Point, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The FBI came into possession of the medal when it was confiscated during an investigation into stolen and counterfeit Medals of Honor. Medal of Honor citation Citation: > Served on board the U.S.S.

Cotter Federal Building is a historic post office, courthouse, and federal office building located at 135-149 High Street in Hartford, Connecticut. It was the courthouse for United States District Court for the District of Connecticut until 1963. Building history In 1882, the federal government completed construction of Hartford's first permanent post office building. By the 1920s, however, Hartford residents were campaigning for a new postal building to replace the overcrowded Second Empire-style structure. In 1928, the government selected a site for the new building, and two years later contracted the local architectural firm of Malmfeldt, Adams, & Prentice to design the building. Although the Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury to hire private architects to design federal buildings, the Hartford project was one of the few times that the Act was actually invoked. Construction commenced in 1931. On April 14, 1932, citizens and officials gathered for a cornerstone laying ceremony, and construction was completed the following year. The new building originally served as a post office, courthouse, and office building. It is one of Hartford's most notable examples of the Neoclassical architectural style, which was commonly used for public buildings during the early twentieth century. Architectural Forum cited the building as an example for private architects to follow when completing Public Works Administration commissions. Major interior renovations to the federal building occurred in 1964 and 1978 after the courts and post office vacated the location. In 1982, the federal government renamed the building to honor Congressman William R. Cotter, who represented the First District of Connecticut from 1971 until his death in 1981. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and currently houses various federal offices. Architecture The William R. Cotter Federal Building is an excellent example of Neoclassical architecture. The architects adopted traditional classical architectural forms while abandoning excessive interior ornament in favor of Art Deco's more stylized decorative components. The building conveys the federal government's dignity and stability, an ideology that was particularly important during the Great Depression. The three-story federal building is situated on a trapezoidal block bounded by High and South Church streets and Foot Guard and Hoadley places in downtown Hartford. The building fills the entire block with its irregular footprint. However, a light court occupies the second and third stories, admitting natural light into the interior. The exterior has remained largely intact since the building's completion in 1933. The steel-frame building rests on a granite foundation. The exterior is faced with Indiana limestone panels. The facade, which faces High Street, consists of a three- story central block flanked by pavilions. Limestone pilasters separate each bay on the central section, which features a projecting cornice topped with decorative cresting. Aluminum spandrels divide each story's casement windows, and spandrels between the first and second stories contain American eagle motifs. Simple recessed panels separate the second and third stories. Projecting pavilions, each containing two modified, Corinthian order columns, frame the two principal entrances located at each end of the High Street elevation. Wisconsin black marble surrounds the entryways. A curved terrace, enclosed by a granite-and-iron balustrade, stretches between the granite entrance steps. Armillary spheres, representing celestial order, are located at each end of the balustrade. A frieze above the facade's third story bears a six-line, two-part inscription that alludes to postal service duties. The quotation is divided by low-relief figures on horse-back transferring a message, recalling the Pony Express and early postal delivery methods. Aluminum eagles with uplifted wings perch at each end of the cornice. Interior spaces are richly ornamented. On the first floor, a principal corridor connects two main lobbies. The lobbies and corridor have their original black terrazzo flooring inlaid with decorative borders and patterns. Most notably, one panel contains Hartford's symbol, which is a hart, or stag, crossing water. Flat panels of polished, Ross Curley Gray Tennessee marble cover the walls and are placed above a red marble base. The first-floor vaulted ceiling is painted blue with metallic gold stars. Aluminum, half-spherical and pendant light fixtures descend from the ceiling. Stylized ornamentation includes chevrons and Greek key patterns. The corridor contains original, Art Deco- style, interior finishes. Each end of the corridor floor is inset with a brass-and-terrazzo panel with an envelope motif. Pairs of engaged black marble columns with aluminum ribs and stylized Doric order capitals flank two murals at each end of the corridor. The murals, painted in 1934 by the Barker Painting Company of New York, depict the eastern and western hemispheres. A decorative frieze lines the top of the corridor walls. The corridor ceiling contains recessed, framed beams bearing medallions with depictions of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln. The two original stairs are adjacent to the two first-floor elevator lobbies. The stairs are made of black soapstone treads and a decorative, aluminum railing. In select locations, the building contains original three-paneled, aluminum doors decorated with stars. Although the federal building has accommodated various functions, it has been continuously occupied since its completion. However, these changes in use resulted in major interior renovations. Most notably, galleries and other postal features were removed when the spaces were transformed into office areas. The corridors, stairwells, and bathrooms retain historic features and finishes.

Lee United States Courthouse is a monumental courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, located on the east side of the New Haven Green. Built between 1913 and 1919, the structure was spared from a planned demolition in the 1960s, and instead renovated to continue its useful life. For many decades, it also served as a post office, although the post office moved to another location in 1979. It is an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Building history In 1910, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and architect Cass Gilbert, two of the most prominent designers working in America at the time, produced a city planning document for New Haven. They advised that the style, materials, and scale of the new courthouse and post office should respect the character of existing public buildings around the Green. James Gamble Rogers designed the building to achieve those goals, and it was constructed between 1913 and 1919. Rogers was also the architect for structures at Yale University, his alma mater. The building was the last to be designed under the auspices of the Tarsney Act (1890 - 1912), which allowed the United States Treasury Department to hire private architects rather than use only designers employed by the federal government. A cornerstone dedication ceremony was held in 1914. Former President William Howard Taft, then a professor at Yale Law School, spoke at the event, and the text of his speech was placed in the cornerstone, along with other mementos.General Services Administration page on the Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse. The courthouse was slated for demolition in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal plan. However, a coalition of federal judges and local historic preservationists rallied to save it. After much negotiation, the landmark was restored in the early 1980s at a cost of $7.3 million. Although some interior spaces were modified, the restoration respected the original character, and many historic components remain intact. In 1998, the building was renamed to honor Richard C. Lee, a former New Haven mayor who was a pivotal figure in the building's preservation as well as the city's revitalization. Architecture The Classical Revival architecture style of architecture chosen for the Richard C. Lee U.S. Courthouse was commonly used for federal building design during the early twentieth century, because officials believed it conveyed the dignity of the federal government. The courthouse displays several hallmarks of the style, including the colossal portico (entrance porch with columns) and pediment (triangular gable end). The columns have Corinthian capitals with carved eagles and leaves. Niches flank the portico. The exterior of the building is clad in Tennessee marble, and the exterior stairs are pink Milford granite. Bronze window sashes, grilles, and the revolving doors provide contrast to the pale gray exterior. Important citizens in New Haven's history inspired the inscriptions on the exterior. The frieze contains words from a sermon delivered by Reverend John Davenport in 1639: \\"Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars\\" (a quote from Proverbs). Davenport was referring to the seven men who were selected to serve as the first General Court, and their names are inscribed on the building. The upper walls of the interior light court were incised with the names of five other prominent New Haven citizens and three military heroes. A carved band tops the building and includes coquillage, which are stylized seashells. An acroterion, the ornament at the apex of the gable, is also a stylized shell. The interior retains many original features and rich finishes. Marble floors and pilasters (attached columns) are found in the ornate entrance lobby. The coffered (recessed) ceiling is intricately detailed with rosettes. The interior wall contains an elaborate bronze screen that led to the original postal workroom. Other original features that remain include writing desks, radiator grilles, and pendant light fixtures, which were specially designed by Rogers. The walls of the main stair and elevator lobbies are clad in the same Tennessee marble as the exterior. However, the marble was finished to reveal more pink tones. Ceilings in this area are vaulted plaster overlaid with gold leaf. Ornate bronze elevator fronts and grilles remain. On the second floor, the courtroom lobby is lined with twenty monolithic, Tennessee marble columns with bronze scrolled Ionic capitals. Marble flooring, wainscot, and benches contribute to the opulent finishes. A plaster cornice and coffered ceiling are painted in tones derived from the marble. In a 1919 article featured in Architectural Forum, the courtroom was described as a \\"dignified, sumptuous room of perfect acoustic qualities.\\" The lavish wall treatments combine fluted pilasters and paneling in quarter-sawn white oak that was stained a light olive color. The ornate plaster cornice and ceiling beams are finished to resemble the oak walls and highlighted with gold leaf. Remarkably, very few alterations were made to the building throughout the years. By 1980, however, it had fallen into disrepair. From 1982 to 1985, it underwent a massive renovation and restoration. The work respected historic integrity while updating spaces to meet the needs of the courts and safety requirements.

It was built originally to house offices of the United States Department of the Interior. Building history The U.S. General Services Administration Building, originally designed for the U.S. Department of the Interior, was the first truly modern office building constructed by the U.S. Government and served as a model for federal offices through the early 1930s. New York architect Charles Butler (1871‚Äì1953) designed the innovative building in his capacity as consultant to the U.S. Treasury Department's Supervising Architect Oscar Wenderoth (1873‚Äì1938). Butler's design, patterned after private office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, allowed for the substantial amount of natural light necessary for the many architects, draftsmen, pressmen, and scientists working in the building. Construction of the restrained Neo- Classical building began in 1915 and was completed in 1917 at a cost of $2,703,494. The Department of the Interior occupied the building from 1917 until 1937, a period significant in the department's history. The activities of the National Park Service were conceived in the sixth floor offices of Interior Secretary Franklin K. Lane. The U.S. Geological Survey, the largest tenant in the building, determined which public lands would be closed to development and conserved for their mineral and water resources. In 1921-1922 the building was the locus of the \\"Teapot Dome\\" scandal involving Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, oversaw construction of dams, fully developed the National Park Service to provide recreational needs, and served as the first Federal Administrator of Public Works. They moved to the Main Interior Building. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) became the building's primary occupant. PWA activities were subsumed into the newly created U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in 1949 and the building was renamed the U.S. General Services Administration Building. In 1986 the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed the construction of glassy, energy-efficient new infill space in the GSA building's East courtyard, and the modernization of half of the rest of the building. This new space, and an open floorplan, allowed employees from previously leased buildings in Crystal City and elsewhere to be moved into this historic building, which saves lease costs and serves as an example for other federal agencies. It continues to house GSA including the Public Buildings Service‚Äîthe largest and most diversified real estate organization in the world. Architecture The U.S. General Services Administration Building, the first government building designed for the specific needs of a designated federal department, was the first federal building to use limestone facing and one of the first buildings in Washington, DC constructed of steel framing. It fills the entire city block between E, F, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Streets. The site was thought by some Congressional representatives to be a poor location for a major federal building due to its distance from Capitol Hill. One Congressman stated in 1913, \\"Every time we build one of these buildings, we get them farther and farther out, after a while they will go to the city limits...it is not a good business policy to scatter these buildings everywhere. The building was designed in an \\"E-shaped\\" configuration, creating open courtyards that provided maximum exposure to natural light and cooling breezes for all offices. This design resulted in glass covering fifty percent of the total wall surface on the street elevations and seventy percent of the total wall surface on the courtyard elevations. The facade was originally to have been built of brick, but substantial cost-savings measures undertaken during construction permitted the use of Indiana limestone for all of the building's exterior. A large building, its exterior is presented without undue ornamentation. The major exterior decorative element is the centrally located F Street entrance. Pilasters and a modillioned cornice frame each of the three entry doors on the F Street facade. An eagle carved by Ernest C. Bairstow, a decorative sculptor from Washington, DC, is located over the central opening. Bairstow also provided the designs for the twenty-eight limestone panels in the frieze at the sixth story and the ornamental work on the F Street entrances. The entrance at the southern end of Eighteenth Street is sheltered by an iron and glass marquee overhanging the granite steps and part of a semi- circular driveway. This unusual entrance treatment was designed originally as a private entrance for the Secretary of the Interior, whose suite of offices was directly above on the sixth floor. This suite on the sixth floor, now used by the GSA Administrator, is the most elaborate space in the building. It includes a private office, a private passage, and a private restroom complete with full bath, as well as a public reception room. Distinguished decorative features in the Administrator's Suite include English oak floor-to-ceiling panels and a relief plaster ceiling. The fireplace of carved French limestone is one of the few working fireplaces remaining in a Federal building in the United States. Beyond this suite, other interior amenities included iced drinking water in the halls, washbasins in each office, and an auditorium, the first such space in a Federal building. A series of improvements have been made to office spaces to meet the evolving needs of the U.S. Department of Interior, Federal Works Administration, and U.S. General Services Administration. In the 1930s a seventh-floor addition was constructed on the roof and air-conditioning was installed throughout the building. Where necessary, extensive remodeling of original corridors was undertaken. In 1999 the U.S. General Services Administration initiated a demonstration \\"First Impressions\\" project in the lobby and on the building's exterior. The goal of the \\"First Impressions\\" program is to change the way people perceive Federal buildings. Initiatives included restoring windows, cleaning exterior masonry, returning public corridors to original paint colors, replicating original corridor lighting, and creating model office space for the twenty-first century.

He is noted for his role in launching the first military procedures in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Military career Seddik graduated from Military Academy in 1933. He was active in the 1948 Palestine War. He joined the ranks of the underground Free Officers Movement in 1951, becoming its most senior member after Muhammad Naguib, and was a lieutenant-colonel of the infantry by 1952. Seddik had been a member of a Communist organisation, the Democratic Movement for National Liberation (DMNL), when the Free Officers requested his membership. On July 23, 1952 was the first to take army action at the beginning of the coup which removed King Farouk and the monarchy from power. He had swiftly moved his forces to occupy the Egyptian Army Headquarters at Kobri al-Qubba an hour before the appointed time. Some attribute this to a glitch in communication. The Minister of War at the time, Haydar Pasha, knew of the Free Officers' plans and had Seddik not set out with his motorized columns from the Hikestep Army Camp prior to the scheduled time of the coup, the minister would have been able thwart their actions.All the Revolution's Men . Al-Ahram Weekly. July 2002. Conflict with the Revolutionary Command Council The leaders of the Free Officers decided to make him a member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council (RCC)‚Äîthe ruling body that ruled Egypt in the aftermath of the coup‚Äîin recognition of his role in the revolution's success. However, Seddik quickly began expressing opposition to many of the RCC's decisions, especially the execution of two Communist workers who incited strikes in factories in Kafr el-Dawwar in August 1952. According to Ahmad Hamrous, a Free Officer himself, Seddik said, \\"any chance I ever had of cooperating with them became impossible. I could not possibly allow myself to go down in history as someone who had remained a member of a Council that abolished civil liberties, sentenced workers to death and placed patriots in jail.\\" He submitted his resignation from the Revolution Command Council in 1953 and later visited Switzerland, disappearing from public life. Seddik was arrested in 1954 after Gamal Abdel Nasser removed Naguib from the presidency, but was released the following year and placed under house arrest for a few months. He went on to join the popular resistance against the British forces in the Suez Canal zone in 1956. In a 1962 speech, Nasser acknowledged the Free Officers' debt to Seddik, saying that without his action \\"all our efforts would have come to nothing.\\" Death Egyptian President Anwar Sadat gave Seddik a state pension when he came to power in 1970 and also sent him for medical treatment in Moscow. When Seddik died in 1975, he was given a full military funeral.

Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2011.), of Lauderdale County, Mississippi, was a conspirator and participant in the notorious murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964. He was a member of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and was sentenced in 1967 by federal district judge William Cox to three years for his role in the crime. Jimmy Snowden had lived in Hickory, Mississippi. While reporting about the death of fellow trial defendant Olen Burrage on March 18, 2013, however, New York Times journalist Douglas Martin claimed that James T. Harris was the only surviving defendant who was tried for the murders, thus implying that Snowden had died by this point in time.  Crime  Klansman James Jordan testified Snowden was among the men who gathered at Akin‚Äôs Mobile Homes in Meridian, Mississippi to meet Edgar Ray Killen, who had instructed Klansmen they had several civil rights workers in jail in Philadelphia and needed to hurry before they were released. Klansman Horace Doyle Barnette said Snowden traveled with him to Philadelphia, where Killen showed the jail where the trio were being held and instructed them on where they should wait behind an old warehouse. After the three civil rights workers were released from jail at 10 p.m., Klansmen pursued them in a high-speed chase. The trio pulled the station wagon over, and Cecil Price ordered them into his patrol car. Barnette identified Snowden as the one who then drove the station wagon to a remote road, where the trio were executed. Jordan identified Snowden as one of those present at the murder scene. Barnette said Snowden rode with him in his car to the dam, where the bodies were buried. Snowden was still with them at about 2 a.m. when the sheriff warned Klansmen not to talk. Barnette said he drove back to Meridian and dropped Snowden off at Akin‚Äôs Mobile Homes. Conviction Snowden was indicted on February 28, 1967. He was later convicted of violating the civil rights of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner on October 20, 1967. On December 29, 1967, Judge William Harold Cox sentenced Snowden to three years in federal prison. However, only two of the three years were spent with Snowden behind bars: he was at FCI Texarkana until December 1971 and then transferred to FCI Lompoc until his release on 29 August, 1972. Snowden was reportedly roughed up in prison by black inmates.  Personal life  Snowden was a truck driver. In fact, when he was released from prison, Snowden returned to trucking jobs in Meridian. Snowden resided in Hickory, Mississippi, during the last years of his life. Snowden was married to Mary Joyce Green (1936-2013).Social Security Administration.

A superhero martial artist, he is associated with Daredevil, and first appeared in Daredevil #112. He was created by Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark. Fictional character biography The man who would be known in the modern age only as Master Izo was a member of the organization The Hand hundreds of years ago in Feudal Japan. Following the death of its founder, Kagenobu Yoshioka, and its transformation from a samurai alliance into a ninja cult in service to a demon, Izo chose to leave. At this time he put out his eyes, which enabled him to see the world, he claimed, as Yoshioka had (and as Daredevil later would).Daredevil #500 Modern Age Izo would later found The Chaste, a rival martial arts association situated atop a sheer cliff known as the Wall. However, his unhindered nature eventually led his students to vote him out, disgusted with his drinking and gambling. Stick took his place as the leader of the Chaste. Izo was revealed to have been present shortly after the accident which gave Matt Murdock his superhuman senses, and reported this information anonymously to Stick. Later still, he became the trainer of the future supervillain and Hand assassin Lady Bullseye, who he promised would one day become the Hand's leader.Daredevil #500 He is mentioned a number of times in the Book of the Iron Fist.Daredevil #114 Much later, following the death of the Skrull posing as Hand leader Elektra, Izo journeyed to New York City, where the four remaining ninja-lords of the Hand were assembling to forcibly induct Daredevil as the new leader. Izo intervened to assist Daredevil in driving them off, which led them to switch their focus to the Kingpin. Izo's purpose was in fact to manoeuvre Daredevil into taking the position, as a means of reforming the Hand away from its corrupted state. He was also revealed to have placed Black Tarantula within the Hand as a mole, unbeknownst to Daredevil. Ultimately, Daredevil accepted the position, and ordered that the Kingpin and Lady Bullseye be banished. Her erstwhile ally's treachery exposed, Lady Bullseye vowed to kill Izo, who told her to \\"get in line.\\"Daredevil #111-119, 500 Subsequently, Izo fakes his own murder at the hands of Daredevil in order to trick the Hand into accepting Daredevil as their leader.Daredevil #501-502 He later shows up in Shadowland to reveal to the heroes involved in the battle against Daredevil and the Hand to explain his discovery that Matt Murdock had been possessed by the Beast.Shadowland #3 Powers and abilities Master Izo is a formidable martial artist, one of the finest anywhere in the world, including being able to wield two katana at once. He has considerable stamina, enabling him to traverse the city by jumping on rooftops. Despite (or rather, as a result of) being blind, he has superhuman-radar senses, much as Daredevil does. He also evidently possesses some form of immortality or at least life-extending capability, as he is now somewhere in the area of 500 years old.

Erminie was the child of Erminie Brooke Wheeler and Roscoe Wheeler. She went to Technical High School in Oakland, California. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1923, and returned there after working for a newspaper in Florida, to pursue a master's degree in anthropology (1930). Her master's thesis was entitled \\"Mythological Elements common to the Kowa and Five Other Plains Tribes.\\" She married linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Voegelin, with whom she jointly conducted fieldwork among Native American tribes. In 1938, fieldwork among the T√ºbatulabal people of northern California led to her first book, T√ºbatulabal Ethnography published by the University of California Press in 1938. In 1933 Eli Lilly, president of the prominent pharmaceutical company in Indiana, created a graduate fellowship at Yale University, to honor Native American history in southern Indiana. Charles Voegelin was the first recipient for the fellowship but it was then given to Erminie. The research she conducted during the fellowship inspired her dissertation. She holds the distinction of being the first woman to receive a doctoral degree in anthropology from Yale University when she received her degree in 1939 with a dissertation entitled \\"Shawnee Mortuary Customs,\\" published five years later by the Indiana Historical Society. In the 1940s, she worked in the upper Great Lakes conducting linguistic and ethnographic fieldwork among the Ottawas and Ojibwe living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. A specialist in Native American folklore, she founded the American Society for Ethnohistory in 1954 and was its first editor of the journal Ethnohistory until 1964. In 1982, the Society created its Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin Prize for best book-length work in the field of ethnohistory. She taught in anthropology, history, and folklore at Indiana University, Bloomington, beginning in the fall of 1943. There she also directed the Great Lakes-Ohio Valley Research Project from 1956 to 1969, the date of her retirement. The research reports on tribes of the region are now housed as the Ohio Valley-Great Lakes Ethnohistory Archive in the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1947 to pursue comparative studies of the folklore and mythology of American Indians and Eskimos. In 1948, she became president of the American Folklore Society, and from 1949 to 1951, she served as secretary for the American Anthropological Association. She edited the Journal of American Folklore from 1941 to 1946. She was one of the original inductees into the Fellows of the American Folklore Society in 1960. Upon retirement, she moved to Great Falls, Virginia, to live with her daughter and son-in-law. In the fall of 1985 she gave her Shawnee field notes and remaining professional books and papers to the Newberry Library in Chicago. She died of cardiac arrest on July 10, 1988.

It specifically lists 15 prehistoric sites in the V√©z√®re valley in the Dordogne department, mostly in and around Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, which has been called the \\"Capital of Prehistory\\". This valley is exceptionally rich in prehistoric sites, with more than 150 known sites including 25 decorated caves, and has played an essential role in the study of the paleolithicum and its art. Three of the sites are the namesakes for prehistoric periods; the Micoquien (named after La Micoque), Mousterian (after Le Moustier), and Magdalenian (after Abri de la Madeleine). Furthermore, the Cro-Magnon rock shelter gave its name to the Cro-Magnon, the generic name for the European early modern humans. Many of the sites were discovered or first recognised as significant and scientifically explored by the archaeologues Henri Breuil and Denis Peyrony in the early twentieth century, while Lascaux, which has the most exceptional rock art of these, was discovered in 1940. The decorated caves in the region were instrumental in ending the debate about the nature of prehistoric art, which was still considered by many to be modern fakes. The late 19th century discoveries of first the Chabot cave (in 1879), Cave of Altamira (in 1880) and Pair-non-Pair (in 1881) were widely discussed, but no definite proof of their ancient origin was generally accepted. The cave of La Mouthe was the first cave in the V√©z√®re region where decorations were discovered, but only with the double discoveries at Font-de-Gaume and Les Combarelles in 1901 was the debate finally settled. The importance of the region as a centre of paleolithic activity and art is explained in the \\"Larousse Encyclopedia of Prehistoric & Ancient Art\\": The same book then lists 7 masterpieces of prehistoric art, including Lascaux, Les Combarelles and Font de Gaume. Twelve of the 15 listed sites are open to a limited number of visitors per day (in most cases less than 100 per day). Two sites (La Mouthe and La Madeleine) are completely inaccessible to the public. In the case of Lascaux, the original cave is closed, but extensive 3D reproductions built nearby are easily accessible. Sites included in the UNESCO listing Decorated caves The \\"swimming deer\\" from Lascaux *Abri du Poisson, a small cave in the Gorge d'Enfer, a small side valley of the V√©z√®re in Les Eyzies; it was discovered in 1892, but the more than 1 metre long engraving of a fish which gives it its name was only found in 1912. Dating to the middle Gravettian, circa 25,000 years ago, it is one of the oldest known depictions of a fish in the world. It is bordered by a few other caves and shelters. *Font-de-Gaume, in Les Eyzies, discovered in 1901: the first time prehistoric paintings were discovered in the region. The paintings of animals (mainly bison and horses, more than 200 in total) date to the Magdalenian and are about 17,000 years old. Font-de-Gaume is the only cave with polychrome prehistoric paintings still open to the public. *La Mouthe, in Les Eyzies, was discovered in 1894. It contains engravings and paintings. A decorated lamp, and a human tooth and backbone were also found here. It is not open to the public. *Les Combarelles, in Les Eyzies, a long () but narrow () cave with more than 600 prehistoric engravings and monochrome paintings. While the entry and a large branch on the right side were already known and excavated, the main branch was only discovered in 1901, just days before nearby Font-de-Gaume. It was inhabited between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. *Lascaux, in Montignac, was discovered in 1940. It is filled with around 600 polychrome paintings from about 17,000 years ago. It was opened to the public in 1948, but closed again in 1963 when it became clear that the paintings were being damaged by fungus and lichen growth caused by the changes in atmosphere brought along by the thousands of visitors. Exact reproductions can be visited since 1983 (Lascaux II, covering the two main chambers) and in 2016 Lascaux IV was opened, showing nearly all the paintings. *Rouffignac Cave, in Rouffignac, is part of the longest cave system in the region. It contains a few hundred engravings and monochrome paintings, mainly of mammoths: most of these are situated about from the cave entrance. An electrical train takes visitors from the entrance to the location of the art. The easy accessibility of the cave lead to it being known much earlier than the other caves in this heritage site; the first mention of the art dates to 1575, and the cave was already a tourist attraction in the 19th century. The distance between the entry and the main groups of rock art here caused their belated discovery in 1956 only. Very few remains apart from the artworks have been found, making dating them difficult; but it is believed that they are about 13,000 years old. *Roc de Saint-Cirq (usually known as \\"Grotte du Sorcier\\") in Les Eyzies, was discovered in 1952. It contains engravings and bas-reliefs, including one of a human called the \\"sorcerer\\" (le sorcier). Other caves *Le Grand Roc is a cave in Les Eyzies close to Laugerie-Basse. It was discovered in 1924 and opened to the public in 1926. It is the only entry in this heritage site without prehistoric elements. Rock shelters Venus impudique (1907 drawing), found in 1864 at Laugerie-Basse *Cro-Magnon rock shelter, in Les Eyzies. The finds date to the Aurignacian. The site was discovered in 1868: remains of 5 humans (4 adults and a child) were found, dated to about 28,000 years ago. Seen as distinct from the recently discovered Neanderthals and as a precursor of modern man, the term \\"Cro-Magnon\\" was soon used to indicate all prehistoric modern men in Europe. *La Micoque, in Les Eyzies. It gave its name to the Micoquien, and was also the first place where the Tayacian was recognised as a separate industry. This archaeological site was discovered in 1895 and has been the location of many excavations since. La Micoque is the site of some of the oldest traces of human presence in the region, dating back to approximately 450,000 years ago. The different layers, together some 10 metres high, are indicative of intermittent habitation here over a period of some 300,000 years. *Laugerie-Basse, a 15 metre deep shelter in Les Eyzies. It has some art from the Magdalenian, and was inhabited from ca. 14,000 years ago.. The first excavations started here in 1863, but a more scientific approach was only taken from 1912 on. It has been completely excavated since, while the nearby contemporary Abri de Marseille (some 40 metres distant) still contains original material. In 1864 Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye found here the V√©nus impudique, the first of many finds of a Paleolithic Venus figurine. *Laugerie-Haute, in Les Eyzies, not far from Laugerie Basse. This 200 metres long shelter was inhabited from about 24,000 years ago until 15,000 years ago, and was first excavated in 1863. Stretching from the rock face to the river, it is one of the largest sites of the region. *Cap Blanc rock shelter, in Marquay; discovered in 1908, this 15 metres long shelter has a 13m long, 2 metres high, and up to 30 cm deep relief frieze of animals, including 10 horses and some bison. It was originally coloured with red ochre and presumably other colours, but due to excavation errors it is now almost completely uncoloured. On the floor a single human skeleton of the so-called Magdalenian Girl was discovered in 1911. *Le Moustier is a group of two rock shelters in Peyzac-le-Moustier. Excavations started in 1863. Many tools found here which were instrumental in defining the Mousterian period, lasting from ca. 160,000 years ago until ca. 40,000 years ago. In 1908 a Neanderthal skull was found here as well: it is thought to be about 45,000 years old. *Abri de la Madeleine, in Tursac, was the type site for the Magdalenian period, ranging from about 17,000 to about 12,000 years ago. First discoevered in 1863 and roughly excavated in the following years, it was in 1921-1922 again studied, more scientifically this time, by Dennis Peyrony. On the site has been found a buried child of around three years old, dating to about 10,000 years ago, with a robe decorated with more than 1,000 small shells, called the Enfant de la Madeleine. Some sculpted reindeer bone spear-throwers have also been found here, including the Bison Licking Insect Bite. Extensive medieval troglodyte ruins remain at the same place but higher above the river. History of archaeological research in the region The 1860s: first scientific explorations The sites cover a period of nearly 400,000 years of human habitation, starting at La Micoque (inhabited from ca. 400,000 years ago until 100,000 years ago) and ending about 8,000 years ago. Excavations in the Dordogne region started in 1810, but only in 1863 were the first scientific researches made by the palontologist Edouard Lartet together with the Englishman Henry Christy; in a period of five months they visited numerous sites in Les Eyzies, including the Grotte Richard, some shelters in the Gorge d'Enfer, Laugerie Basse, Laugerie Haute, La Madeleine and Le Moustier. In 1872 the latter two became the eponymous sites for the Magdalenian and Micoquian cultures, so-called by Gabriel de Mortillet. Lartet previously already had excavated the Cave of Aurignac, which gave its name to the Aurignacian, and had published his finds of a few of the earliest decorated objects from the Upper Paleolithicum. In 1864 they found at La Madeleine an engraving on ivory, showing a mammoth: this was the first definitive piece of evidence that the inhabitants of these rock shelters had lived at the same time as some long- extinct animals. In 1868 the human remains of the Cro-Magnon rock shelter were discovered, and in 1872 a prehistoric skeleton was found at Laugerie Basse. The first decorated cave of the region was found in 1896 at La Mouthe: it was the fourth decorated cave found in Europe, some 20 years after the other three had been discovered. Turn of the century; the first decorated caves Excavations at the Abri du Cap Blanc in 1911 At the start of the 20th century, the excavations in the V√©z√®re valley multiply, with two major effects: the authenticity of rock art is finally established, and a full chronology of the technological cultures in prehistoric Western Europe is developed. In 1895, for the first time a cave with decorations from the Paleolithic is recognised as such in France, when the cave of la Mouthe is investigated by archaeologist √âmile Rivi√®re. Engravings are found some 90 metres of the entrance of the cave. Rivi√®re continues to excavate here for five years, finding many artifacts including a lamp with an image of an ibex. His conclusion that some of the engravings had been covered by stalagmites, thereby showing their great age, was one of the main arguments to get the reality of prehistoric rock art finally accepted. he also produced the first photographs of such art. Most important for the rock art were the discoveries in 1901 of the engravings of Combarelles by Henri Breuil, Denis Peyrony and Louis Capitan, and the first look at the polychrome paintings in Font de Gaume, eight days later, by Peyrony. In 1902, √âmile Cartailhac, the main critic of the notion that Paleolithic humans would have been capable of producing such art, upon seeing the reports about the two caves and La Mouthe, became convinced that the believers had been right all along. He wrote for the journal \\"L'Anthropologie\\" the article \\"Les cavernes orn√©es de dessins. La grotte d'Altamira, Espagne. Mea culpa d'un sceptique\\". Breuil and Peyrony are also behind most of the other major finds in the next few years, including Bernifal in 1902, the abri du Cap Blanc in 1909, and Laussel in 1911. In the same period, major sites permitting to develop the stratigraphic sequence of periods and cultures are found as well, including in 1909 La Ferrassie with its large number of Neanderthal burials, and the site of Laugerie Basse. Peyrony, a teacher from Les Eyzies, became inspector of archaeological sites in 1910, and established the museum of Les Eyzies (later the National Museum of Prehistory) in 1913. The final major find so far is the discovery of Lascaux in 1940.

History The band members are from the Scandinavian region, Denmark and Sweden. The band was formed in 2002 but the members have known one another for many years. The twins Mike (Bass, Vocals) and Christian (Guitars, Vocals) met drummer Bjorn in kindergarten when they were all 4 years old. When the three of them moved from the small town Ringsted to Copenhagen, they quickly met Jeppe (Sax, Percussion, Vocals) and the recent newcomer from Sweden; Niklas (Keys, Samplers, Trombone, Vocals) in the circles of the Copenhagen experimental music scene. The five guys decided to make a band with the aesthetics from Impro, Post-rock and jazz served in an edible form. The result is a sound you could characterize as chamber-pop with a lot of influences from all over the world. Slaraffenland joined the American label Hometapes in 2006, making their debut at CMJ Music Marathon that year.Team Clermont - We're on Your Side Release Details Early Releases The band self-released Slaraffenland (2004) and Jinkatawa EP (2005). The self- titled Slaraffenland debut CD was recorded October 2003 at Sauna Recording Studio in Copenhagen, with production from Magnus Groth. It was released on February 2004. The cover was made by graphic designer Paw Nielsen.Official site description Jinkatawa EP was recorded at Fredrik Mellqvist studio(FM Produktion) and Rumraket studio in Copenhagen. Mixed and produced by Mads Brauer and Casper Clausen from Efterklang. The CD was printed in 500 copies on a 3\\" mini CD. With a hand-made cover decorated with stickers designed by Mette Heide. The inside artwork was made by Mbobo. Both releases were completely instrumental and featured a more jazz-driven style.

It was produced and mixed by Petter Samuelsson, with packaging designed by the world- famous Friends With You.HomeTapes Releases - Private Cinema In 2008, the band toured Denmark and United States with fellow friends and collaborators Efterklang and released the EP \\"Sunshine\\", which included and covers of Radiohead's Paranoid Android, a-ha's Take On Me and three brand new tracks. It featured artwork by Slaraffenland's own Niklas Antonson, packaged in a custom wallet featuring spot-color printing and a full-color insert.HomeTapes Releases - Sunshine EP The album received a very positive review from Pitchfork Media, with the reviewer concluding: \\"The album as a whole is a brave perambulation, drawing on the acidic thunderstorms and gorgeous lullabies of two great Icelandic exports (Bj√∂rk on \\"You Win\\" and Sigur R√≥s for aching closer \\"How Far Would You Go\\"). In music, it's not often that this borderline overindulgence, where structure and uniformity are all but forgotten, works. But here the members of Slaraffenland showcase their virtuoso skills and shared vision, always modestly.\\" Pitchfork Review - Private Cinema We're On Your Side The band debuted songs from their third album We're on your side at SXSW Music Festival, in March 2009, as part of their own showcase titled \\"Danish Dynamite\\". An outdoor party featuring the likes of Efterklang, Murder, and the Choir of Young Believers. It was recorded with production assistance from Danish producer Fridolin.

John Howard has been credited as establishing the practice of single-celling in the United Kingdom and, by extension, in the United States. In 1957, only 15 prisons in the United States practiced single-celling exclusively while 41 prisons employed it with a portion of their cells and 44 housed multiple prisoners in all of their cells. Critics of single-celling suggest that the practice imposes psychologically harmful isolation on inmates, while advocates argue that single-celling alleviates many of the inmates' discomforts. The practice in many prisons of allowing general population prisoners to freely intermingle during normal hours diminishes the critics argument, while single celling gives prisoners a (relatively) safe place to retreat. The majority of cells allow the cell doors to be closed by an inmate and automatically lock. This provides additional security to potentially at risk individuals. Single celling also improves investigations of contraband possession since only a single inmate is assigned to a cell.

It was presented at the photokina in Cologne in 1951, and launched commercially about two years later. The design is by Heinz Kilfitt, who is also known for designing the original Robot camera and the Kowa Six. The camera is equipped with the newly developed Prontor-Compur (PC) reflex shutter, which would pave the way for reputable camera designs such as the 1953 Contaflex, the 1956 Retina Reflex, the 1957 Hasselblad 500, and the 1959 Voigtl√§nder Bessamatic. However, it does not have the built-in eye-level pentaprism finder, which was first seen on 35mm SLR cameras in 1949. Instead, it has a waist-level finder with a central split- image rangefinder complemented by large full frame magnifier incorporating a central loupe that covers the rangefinder central area. Description The complete camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush cover with no protruding controls. When flipped open, it reveals the waist-level finder. On the right- hand side is the single-stroke wind-on lever with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the rewind knob with a film reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the ¬º inch tripod socket, the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back. The Mecaflex is equipped with a unique breech-lock lens mount operated by a lever at five-o-clock at the front. Sliding the lever toward six-o-clock releases the lens. The shutter speed dial surrounds the lens mount. The semi-automatic preset lens diaphragm is automatically closed by a small protrusion at seven-o-clock at the lens mount, but activated manually by an anti-clockwise turn of the aperture ring while depressing a small release button on it and then returned to the required preset aperture value. In this way, the lens is wide open for bright finder image and ready to instantly close down upon shutter release. A focusing lever is situated on the left-hand lens control. A PC sync. contact is situated at the edge of the lens panel. The Metz manufactured cameras also has an M/X synchronisation selector on the opposite side on the lens panel, and the fastest shutter speed is 1/300 sec. The Mecaflex is built of precision cast metal alloy parts with a matte chrome finish and decorated with a striped black body covering material. The camera, at first a Metz product for which Kilfitt was to supply the lenses, was manufactured at the Metz Apparatefabrik in F√ºrth, Germany; but reputedly, due to conflicting interests, the production was taken over by Kilfitt and moved to Monaco in 1958, and manufactured there for another seven years. Apart from the SEROA markings at the top to this effect, these later cameras have a different fine grain body covering material, the shutter speed extend to 1/250 sec. and the M/X flash sync switch is left out, the feature conspicuously missing on the top left of the lens panel. Kilfitt was a reputable lens manufacturer, well known for designs like the 1955 Macro Kilar series and the manufacture of the Voigtl√§nder 2.8 / 32-86 mm Zoomar. He started lens manufacturing in Munich in 1941 and expanded production to Liechtenstein in 1947, but production was later gathered in Munich. However, only a limited number of lenses were made for the Mecaflex: * Kilfitt Kilar 1:2.8 F=40 licensed by Benoist Berthiot, Paris * Kilfitt Kilar 1:3.5 / 40 manufactured by Heinz Kilfitt, M√ºnchen * Kilfitt Tele-Kilar 1:4 /105 The camera came in a small box complete with a zippered case and a metal neck strap.
