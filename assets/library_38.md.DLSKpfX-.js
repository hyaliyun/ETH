The most recognizable national symbols of Saint Lucia are the flag and the coat of arms.  Flag of st.lucia  The national flag of Saint Lucia. The national flag of Saint Lucia was adopted on March 1, 1967, upon achieving self-government. The flag was designed by Dunstan St. Omer. The government of St. Lucia gives the following description of the flag: The blue colour represent fidelity. It reflects the tropical sky and also the emerald surrounding waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The gold represents the prevailing sunshine in the Caribbean and prosperity. The triangles represent the mountains in St. Lucia. The Triangle, the shape of which is the partition isosceles triangle, is reminiscent of the island‚Äôs famous twin Pitons at Soufriere, rising sheer out of the sea, towards the sky -themselves, a symbol of the hope and aspirations of the people.  Coat of arms  The national coat of arms. The coat of arms of Saint Lucia was designed by Sydney Bagshaw in 1967. The coat of arms is made of a blue shield with a stool, two roses and two fleur de lis. The shield is supported by two Saint Lucian parrots. Beneath the shield is the national motto, where as above the shield there is a torch and on ornament. The symbolism of the elements are: *Tudor rose - England *Fleur de lis - st.lucia *Stool - Africa *Torch - Beacon to light the path *Saint Lucia parrot - Amazona versicolor, the national bird * Motto: \\"The land, the people, the light\\"  Anthem  The national anthem of Saint Lucia is Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia. The anthem was first adopted in 1967 upon achieving self-government, and confirmed as the official anthem upon independence in 1979. The lyrics were written by Rev.Charles Jesse, and the music by Mr.Leton Thomas Saint Lucian parrot  The national bird of Saint Lucia. The Saint Lucia amazon (also known as the Saint Lucia parrot) (Amazona versicolor) is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is endemic to Saint Lucia and is the country's national bird. It was first described by Miller in 1776, this beautiful parrot is, and always has been found only in Saint Lucia. It is predominantly green in colour, and a typical specimen has a cobalt blue forehead merging through turquoise to green on the cheeks and a scarlet breast. There are no visible differences between the two sexes. Mating for life and maturing after five years, these long-lived birds are cavity nesters, laying two to three white eggs in the hollow of a large tree during the onset of the dry season between February and April. Incubation commences on the appearance of the second egg and lasts 27 days. The young fledge leave the nest 67 days after hatching. Today the parrot, and most other forms of wildlife are absolutely protected in the country, because Saint Lucia‚Äôs national bird remains an endangered species.  National clothing  According to the government of Saint Lucia the national dress are the Wob Dwiyet and the Madras. The Wob Dwiyrt consists of the following: *A long petticoat made of cotton or satin and decorated with rows of lace and ribbon. *The Dwiyet ‚Äì A full-length outer dress with a trail and narrow sleeves that extend to the wrists. *A Foulard ‚Äì A scarf worn around the neck and shoulders with a triangular apex at the centre of the back and attached to the Dwiyet at the front with a brooch. This scarf is made of satin and is usually of a colour that contrasts with that of the dress. *The Tete Cas√© ‚Äì A folded head piece which is decorated to suit the taste or status of the wearer. In addition, wearers of the Wob Dwiyet adorn themselves with a substantial amount of jewellery including long necklaces and large earrings. The Wob Dwiyet is a style of ladies' dress which began appearing in the French West Indies towards the end of the 18th century. Its design is believed to have originated from Southern France, where women at the time wore a similar outfit.

Its long history places it on the Champs-√âlys√©es before the street's beautification. Situated in a two- storey pavilion with gardens, Ledoyen is considered to be one of Paris' best gourmet restaurants, and boasts three Michelin stars. The building is owned by the City of Paris, and the current operator of the restaurant itself is the company \\"Carr√© des Champs Elys√©es\\".  History  Initially, it began in 1779 as a very small inn named Au Dauphin. It was located near the Place Louis XV (current Place de la Concorde), near the Caf√© des Ambassadeurs (between Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es and the current Avenue Gabriel). At that time it was a country inn on the outskirts and cows grazed in the fields outside. On 4 August 1791, Pierre-Michel Ledoyen, a son of caterers, rented it and established it as a formal restaurant. Scandinavian Artists' Lunch at Cafe Ledoyen, by Hugo Birger, 1886 Ledoyen, a dishwasher in his early years, renamed the restaurant after himself in 1814, and it was owned by the Desmazures for many years. In 1842, architect Jacques Hittorff, responsible for the development of the gardens of the Champs-√âlys√©es, transferred the restaurant to its present location. Six years later, it was repaired and renovated following a fire. Today, the building walls are owned by the city of Paris. Despite its prestige and its three Michelin Star status under Christian Le Squer since 2002, the restaurant is reportedly inexpensive and serves a varied clientele. It is currently operated by Yannick All√©no, who in his first year achieved 3 Michelin Stars. Architecture and fittings Diane's Fountain, next to Ledoyen, was built in 1840 by Jacques Hittorff and decorated by the sculptor Louis Desprez. The original building was , with white walls and green shutters. When the restaurant was relocated in 1784 it was to a two- storey pavilion with terraced gardens, designed in the Neoclassical style. The 1886 oil-on-canvas, Scandinavian Artists' Lunch at Cafe Ledoyen, Paris, on Varnishing Day by the Swedish painter Hugo Birger suggests something of the appearance of the restaurant in the late 19th century. Its features include many huge windows, ornate ceilings, and historic second floor rooms. Dining areas include outdoor seating, interior salons, and a 1950s style grill room. Notable patrons During the late 18th century, it was a haunt of Louis de Saint-Just and Maximilien Robespierre and they dined there on 26 July 1794, two days before their execution. Napoleon and Jos√©phine de Beauharnais reportedly met at the restaurant and the restaurant was also a favourite of artists and writers such as Danton, Marat, Degas, Monet, Zola, Flaubert and Guy de Maupassant. A mid-19th-century account states that the restaurant was also the breakfast place of duellists, who, after shooting at each other in the Bois de Boulogne, reconciled over breakfast at Ledoyen.

The letters were first published in 1746 as Letters and Memorials of State, edited by Arthur Collins. Life and career Whyte was the son of Richard Whyte of Beaumaris, Anglesey. He was born in Anglesey and in 1601 wrote a letter asking to be appointed as muster-master (militia recruiter) for the area. Before that he seems to have travelled on the continent and gained a reputation with the Sidney family for honesty and efficiency in business. He worked for the Sidneys in the 1590s, possibly serving in some military capacity at one point.Lisle C. John, \\"Rowland Whyte, Elizabethan Letter-Writer\\", Studies in the Renaissance, 1961, pp.217-235. In 1595 he was sent to London by Sir Robert Sidney, who had been appointed as governor of Flushing (Vlissingen in the Netherlands). His role was to lobby for resources for Flushing, while also relaying to Sir Robert the latest political gossip from court. Each of his letters, therefore, is essentially a news report with updates on events. Whyte also wrote newsletters to the Earl of Shrewsbury. From 1598 to 1614 Whyte was also employed as \\"postmaster of the court\\", which entailed managing the Royal Mail and organising posting points for horses during royal progresses. In 1599 Whyte married. He and his wife had many children, though the exact number is uncertain. During this period he acquired leases on several properties, including farms and other properties which he rented. He also seems to have used his aristocratic contacts to obtain income by collecting fines. He was made lifetime Constable of Caernarfon Castle, at an annual income of ¬£60, but he later sold the post back to the king for ¬£500. He seems to have left London around 1614, to return to Wales. The date of his death is not known, but his last letter is dated 27 July 1626. Letters Whyte is known for his character sketches of notable people at court, especially the influential aristocrats of the day, such as the Earl of Essex, the Herberts, Cecils (Lord Burghley and his son Robert Cecil) and other lesser figures. After Essex's unwonted return from Ireland, Whyte describes the disorder and uncertainty it created: > His lordship's sudden return out of Ireland brings all sorts of knights, > captains, officers, and soldiers, away from thence, that this town is full > of them, to the great discontentment of her majesty, that they are suffered > to leave their charge. But the most part of the gallants have quitted their > commands, places, and companies, not willing to stay there after him; so > that the disorder seems to be greater there than stands with the safety of > that service.Wyte, in Collins (ed), Sydney Papers, ii. p. 131 While he mentions literature and plays, he generally has nothing to say about them except as occasions for gossip and social networking.

Louis Poulsen Lighting is represented by subsidiaries, distribution offices and agents around the world. Their key sales regions are Scandinavia, Europe, Japan and United States. Some of Louis Poulsen's best designers were Arne Jacobsen and Poul Henningsen. Some of their signature products are the PH- Lamps. History Poul Henningsen's PH-5 lamp. Poul Henningsen's iconic \\"Artichoke\\" lamp. Louis Poulsen PH Kontrast In 1874 Ludvig R. Poulsen sets up a wine importing business under the name Kj√∏benhavns direkte Vin-Import- Kompagni (The Copenhagen Direct Wine Import Company). The firm closed down in 1878. In 1892 Ludvig Poulsen opened his second business, this time selling tools and electrical supplies. In 1896 Ludvig R. Poulsen hires his nephew, Louis Poulsen. Ludvig R. Poulsen dies in 1906. His nephew Louis takes over the business and, two years later, moves it to Nyhavn 11. In 2019 the head quarter moved to Holmen, in Copenhagen, which is company's head office location today. Five years later, Sophus Kaastrup-Olsen becomes a partner in the firm, whose name is changed to Louis Poulsen & Co. In 1914 Louis Poulsen & Co. publishes its first catalogue ‚Äì featuring machines and tools. In 1917, Sophus Kaastrup- Olsen buys Louis Poulsen's share in the firm for 10,000 Danish kroner and becomes the sole owner of Louis Poulsen & Co. Designer Poul Henningsen began working together with Louis Poulsen in 1924, with a view to taking part in an international exhibition for decorative art to be held in Paris called \\"Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs & Industriels Modernes\\". A competition was held to find qualified participants: Henningsen was one of the winners. Next year, Poul Henningsen's lamps earned Gold medals in this exhibition. In 1926 Louis Poulsen and Poul Henningsen are awarded a contract to provide lighting for the newly constructed Forum building in Copenhagen using the now-legendary PH lamp with three shades system. Louis Poulsen starts marketing light fittings, and its first lighting catalogue is published with descriptions in Danish, German, English and French. In 1941, at the time of World War II, Louis Poulsen & Co. A/S acquires the Laurits Henriksen metal goods factory in Copenhagen and becomes a manufacturer of lighting fittings. Henningsen designed a blackout lamp for the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen which allows the Gardens to stay open until midnight: the light from the lamps cannot be seen from aeroplanes flying over the city. The PH5 lamp is launched in 1958: the 5 in its name refers to its 50 cm diameter. The first lighting subsidiary outside Denmark is set up in Western Germany in 1962. Other subsidiaries are established in France, in 1964 and in Sweden, 1975. In 1967 the partnership I/S El-Salg is founded. After 2 years Elpefa A/S moves to a new factory building at Sluseholmen and takes over all production and assembly of fixtures and fittings. In 1977 Elpefa A/S merges with Louis Poulsen. Louis Poulsen class B shares are quoted on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange for the first time. 1985, a lighting subsidiary in the United States, a wholesale electrical supplies business in the Faroe Islands, and JO-EL A/S are set up. In 1987 a lighting subsidiary in Norway is established. Louis Poulsen Group sales pass the 1 billion DKK mark. Subsidiaries in Australia and Netherlands are opened the following year. In 1989, Louis Poulsen purchases Skandia Havemann's El A/S, thereby acquiring 16 wholesale electrical supplies outlets. Poul Henningsen would have turned 100 years old on 9 September 1994. Louis Poulsen & Co. A/S celebrated the occasion by publishing a book on the history of the PH lamp, by recreating the PH table lamp and TREPH pendant of the late 1920s, and by arranging an exhibition of old PH lamps at the Design Museum Danmark (Kunstindustrimuseet) in Copenhagen. In 2004, Louis Poulsen Lighting, Fritz Hansen, Royal Copenhagen and Bang & Olufsen cooperate on an exhibition in Tokyo on the occasion of Queen Margrethe's official visit to Japan in November. The exhibition titled \\"Styling Danish Life\\" is created by the world- famous architect Tadao Ando. In June 2018, an investment subsidiary of Investindustrial VI L.P. (‚ÄúInvestindustrial‚Äù) has acquired Louis Poulsen A/S. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and expected to close in Q3 2018.

Formed in 2005, the group is known for its mix of guitar-based metal with electro influences along with melodic vocal lines and orchestral arrangements. Between 2006 and 2010 they released several records and DVDs and in 2011 they launched their first full-length studio album, \\"Season 3\\" (Daily Rock Records / Musikvertrieb) mixed by the legendary Stefan Glaumann (Rammstein, Within Temptation, Deathstars), which received excellent reviews throughout Europe and the US. Their second album, \\"Awaraxid 7mg\\", followed in 2014. The tracks of this opus revolve around the creation of a brand new drug whose effect is to remind people who they really are, with the consequent realization that, if they are not happy with their life, they bear the privilege and the burden of realizing their true self. The record received tremendous feedback both from the international media and the fans. November-7 open for well-established artists such as Marilyn Manson, Within Temptation, Sabaton, Paradise Lost, Lacuna Coil. In 2012 and 2016 they toured the UK, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Czech Republic and Poland. The band is currently working on their new record \\"Overload 2.0\\" album that is planned to be out in 2021.  History  Formation and EPs (2005-2008) Guitarist St√©phane and Vocalist Anna formed November-7 in 2005 and quickly released their first EP \\"Mesmerised\\" (2006). Recruiting guitarist Yann Berger and drummer Gil Reber that year, they started playing local venues and establishing their reputation as a live act. While \\"Mesmerised\\" established their style, it was 2007's \\"Angel\\" and its eponymous EP that got November-7 their first media attention and local radio airplay, and spread the band's reputation further afield. \\"Alive!\\" (2008-2010) In 2008, a show in Neuch√¢tel gave the band an opportunity to record their live show. The result was the live album/DVD set \\"Alive!\\" which immediately caught the attention of specialist magazines such as Hard Rock Mag, Metal Edge Magazine and Synthetics Mag. Reber left the band in 2009, and was replaced by Sieg. On the back of this lineup change, with positive reviews, a steady stream of gigs across the country, November-7 started work in earnest on their first full-length studio album. \\"Season 3\\" (2010-2012) November-7 performs at Festi'Neuch in 2012 Throughout 2010, live shows throughout Switzerland were well received. Berger was replaced by Matt in January 2010, and recordings for the band's debut album went on throughout the year. In Autumn 2010, St√©phane and Anna went to Stockholm to mix the album at Toytown Studios with producer Stefan Glaumann (\\"Rammstein\\", \\"Clawfinger\\", \\"Within Temptation\\"). The resulting album, \\"Season 3\\" (2011), was released in February 2011 and gathered excellent reviews from magazines and webzines throughout the world.http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=8940http://www.soniccathedral.com/webzine/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=582&Itemid;=35http://www.gryphonmetal.ch/November7_Season3.htmlhttp://www.stalker.cd/index.php?lang=2&content;=62&kat;=cd&id;=2090http://www.femmemetal.net/november7season3rev.htmhttp://www.fit4talent.com/reviews/season-3-by- november-7/13/ The album was released by record label Daily Rock Records and was distributed across Europe (Musikvertrieb/Season of Mist) and in the USA (Sonic Cathedral).

Livingston was appointed Mayor in 1985 by the city council. He won election as Richmond's first elected African American mayor in 1989 for a full term. Biography Early life Livingston was born and raised in rural Oklahoma. In 1952, he moved with his family to Richmond, California, where members of his family found employment in the East Bay shipyards. Livingston graduated from Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He received his bachelor's degree in political science from Antioch University, which had a now defunct satellite campus in neighboring San Francisco. Livingston said that his interest in politics began in the early 1960s, when he met Martin Luther King Jr. at a speech at Contra Costa College. Livingston earliest jobs included positions at a paper factory in Richmond and the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He later worked in the regulatory department of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company for the majority of his nonpolitical career. Political career Before entering local politics, Livingston became active in neighborhood and church groups. Livingston was first elected to the Richmond City Council in 1965, becoming the second African American ever elected to the council (The first was George Carroll). Livingston served three consecutive terms beginning in 1965, before leaving office. In 1973, Livingston was elected again to the city council, where he remained until his appointment to the mayor's office in 1985. Mayor The position of Mayor rotated between city council members until 1981, when it became a popularly elected office. Thomas Corcoran was elected the first elected mayor. Richmond Mayor Tom Corcoran died in office in 1985. According to city law, the city council needed to choose Corcoran's successor from the sitting members of the council. The city council appointed Livingston, a member of the council, to serve out the remainder of Cochran's unexpired term. Contra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia explained the council's decision to appoint Livingston to the mayor's office, \\"They thought George would be the best person to unite the council and the communities in Richmond...If you look at his legacy, he really worked hard at trying to find common ground among City Council members.\\" In 1989, Livingston announced his candidacy for a full term as mayor. He won the 1989 mayoral election, becoming Richmond's first elected African American mayor. As mayor, Livingston oversaw the construction of the city's 23rd Street overpass and the early redevelopment of the Port of Richmond. Livingston was able to attract new offices and businesses to Richmond, including a U.S. Social Security office, a U.S. Postal Service bulk mail facility, and the Hilltop shopping center. In 1993, Livingston was defeated for re-election by Rosemary Corbin. George Livingston died from complications of diabetes at Doctors Hospital in San Pablo, California, on January 7, 2012, at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife, Eunice Livington; daughter, Grace Livingston-Nunley; and son, George Jr. U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-California) called Livingston \\"...a leader and also a coalition builder,\\" saying, \\"He was able to work across the entire community. His goal was the development and growth of Richmond.\\" References Category:2012 deaths Category:Mayors of Richmond, California Category:Richmond City Council members (California) Category:Antioch College alumni Category:Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) alumni Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:1930s births Category:African-American mayors in California ","title":"George Livingston"},{"id":"34432332","text":"Suillia vaginata, is a European species of Heleomyzidae.

Since ancient times, hides have also been used as a writing medium, in the form of parchment. Fur clothing was used by other hominids, at least the Neanderthals. Rawhide is a simple hide product, that turns stiff. It was formerly used for binding pieces of wood together. Today it is mostly found in drum skins. Tanning of hides to manufacture leather was invented during the Paleolithic. Parchment for use in writing was introduced during the Bronze Age and later refined into vellum, before paper became commonplace. Prehistoric and Ancient use The world's oldest leather shoe. A German parchmenter during the 16th century. Ian Gilligan (Australian National University) has argued convincingly that hominids without fur would have needed leather clothing to survive outside the tropics in mid-latitude Eurasia, southern Africa, and the Levant during the cold glacial and stadial periods of the Ice Age, and there is archaeological evidence for the use of hide and leather in the Paleolithic. Simple, unmodified stone flakes could have been used to scrape hides for tanning, but scraper tools are more specialized for tasks such as woodworking and hideworking. Both of these stone tool shapes were invented in the Oldowan,, but direct evidence for hideworking has not been found from earlier than about 400,000 years ago. Examination of microscopic use-wear on scrapers demonstrates they were used to prepare hides at that time at Hoxne in England. The earliest known bone awls date to between 84,000 and 72,000 years ago in South Africa, and their use-wear shows that they were probably used to pierce soft materials, such as tanned leather. Bone awls were later made in the Aurignacian in Europe, west Asia, and Russia, and also in Tasmania during the Last Glacial Maximum., The earliest eyed sewing needles date to between 43,000 and 28,500 years ago, probably at least 35,000 years ago, in southern Siberia, and were used across Paleolithic Eurasia and in North America. Paleolithic hunters are also known to have targeted fur-bearing animals, such as wolves and arctic foxes in Europe, mole-rats in Africa, and red-necked wallabies in Tasmania. As animal husbandry was introduced during the Neolithic, human communities got a steady source of hides. The oldest confirmed leather tanning tools were found in ancient Sumer and date to approximately 5,000 BCE. The oldest surviving piece of leather footwear is the Areni-1 shoe that was made in Armenia around 3,500 BCE. Another, possibly older, piece of leather was found in Guitarrero Cave in northern Peru, dating to the Archaic period. The first written references to leather are documented from Ancient Egypt around 1,300 BCE. Various substances used were tannin obtained from trees, as well as animal brains, or faeces. The odor from tanning separated the tanneries from populated areas. Medieval use During the Middle Ages, leather craft was developed, as turnshoes and welt shoes were invented. Refined kinds of leather such as suede and nubuck were also introduced. Modern use New kinds of tanning chemicals came to use during the Industrial Revolution. Chromium tanning was invented during the 1850s. Patent leather has been manufactured since 1819. Phenol formaldehyde resin came into use during World War II. Fur farming was introduced in the 19th century, and is today the main source of fur clothing. Synthetic fur is an alternative to genuine fur, for cost and ethical reasons. Several kinds of synthetic leather have been invented during the 20th century.

Research has shown that language acquisition and learning is socially constructed and interactive in nature. According to the theory of language socialization, language learning is interwoven with cultural interaction and \\"mediated by linguistic and other symbolic activity\\". From this perspective, the use of technologies that facilitate communication and connection, particularly social media applications and programs, makes a lot of sense. Language learners are able to enhance their language skills due to the different avenues in which new social media have created.  Classroom  A range of social media can be used to facilitate language learning, including blogs, online role-playing games, fan fiction writing, and so on. Outside the classroom A growing body of research is documenting the ways in which primarily young people are learning languages via their social media, on their own, outside of formal language learning classes or programs. Social media studied include: online role-playing games, fan fiction writing, instant messaging, fan websites, virtual worlds, chat, and the like. Online gaming Many MMO (massively multiplayer online) games cross national and linguistic boundaries. They often have built-in chat functions and enable participants to chat with players from all over the world who speak various languages. This can provide players with the opportunity to learn a new language‚Äîat least at a basic level‚Äîso they can participate more fully in the game with the other players. The social interaction these players engage in while playing the game helps with their understanding of the grammar constructions and conversational ways of the language they are using. In short, gamers may well be using a language they are learning much sooner than they otherwise might, given the highly contetxualised nature of the talk typically found within game-play situations and the text-based medium of interaction. Without this social interaction, many students may be less willing to practice their new skills which would enhance their abilities in the language they are learning. Rankin, Morrison, Mckenzie, McNeal, Gooch and Shute found found that English as a second Language (ESL) students were able to acquire more language skills through the social communication that they had with the native speakers of English. Learning language from video games, it is argued, is a contextual process. Gamers playing a game that has text and audio in a language other than their own (e.g., an English-speaking player playing a Japanese game) can draw on the context of the game to help them understand what is being said or written within the game. Many video games use repetition in their commands and this enables the player to recognize these words and come to understand what they mean and represent over time. Games transform the learning process from a passive task to one in which individuals engage actively in the experience of learning by focussing first on meaning. Computer games, researchers' argue, supply authentic environments for language learning, complete with ample opportunities for students to develop and test their emerging target language knowledge. It is important to note that not all people who play these MMOs or video games necessarily start out wanting to learn a new language. Individuals playing MMOs typically want to be able to maintain social relationships with people who speak another language.

Memories of Old Withnell Fold, A Countryside Publication, Brinscall, Chorley. . Three years later a second machine was installed, and the business was so successful that a third machine was installed in 1855. The machines were known as \\"74\\", \\"66\\" and \\"60\\", the widths of the paper produced. The quality and variety of the paper improved, and in 1849, tissue paper was made, followed in 1856 by coloured tissue. Writing papers were introduced in 1863 and had a reputation for being of the finest quality. Cartridge paper came in 1878. The mill supplied newsprint for Preston, Bolton and Liverpool newspapers. The firm continued as a family concern until 1890 when it combined with Wiggins Teape & Co., an old established firm of stationers. Although the merger did not take place until 1890, the mill had supplied paper to Wiggins and Teape from 1847, and in an old diary kept by Mr. T. B. Parke, there is an entry for February of that year, which reads \\"Am now making double cap ordered by Wiggins & Teape\\".

Related concepts Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement \\"Mobile first\\", unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement are related concepts that predate RWD. Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or media queries, so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and Personal Computers, rather than rely on graceful degradation to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones. Progressive enhancement based on browser, device, or feature detection Due to the high volume of internet traffic using mobile devices, they can no longer be ignored. In 2014, for the first time more users accessed the internet from their mobile devices than desktop. Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, browser (\\"user agent\\") detection (also called \\"browser sniffing\\") and mobile device detection are two ways of deducing if certain HTML and CSS features are supported (as a basis for progressive enhancement)‚Äîhowever, these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database. For more capable mobile phones and PCs, JavaScript frameworks like Modernizr, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features (or identify the device or user agent) are popular. Polyfills can be used to add support for features‚Äîe.g. to support media queries (required for RWD), and enhance HTML5 support, on Internet Explorer. Feature detection also might not be completely reliable; some may report that a feature is available, when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is effectively nonfunctional. Challenges, and other approaches Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges, and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns. He suggests that, compared with a simple RWD approach, device experience or RESS (responsive web design with server-side components) approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices. Server-side \\"dynamic CSS\\" implementation of stylesheet languages like Sass or Incentivated's MML can be part of such an approach by accessing a server based API which handles the device (typically mobile handset) differences in conjunction with a device capabilities database in order to improve usability. RESS is more expensive to develop, requiring more than just client-side logic, and so tends to be reserved for organizations with larger budgets. Google recommends responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches. Although many publishers are starting to implement responsive designs, one ongoing challenge for RWD is that some banner advertisements and videos are not fluid. However, search advertising and (banner) display advertising support specific device platform targeting and different advertisement size formats for desktop, smartphone, and basic mobile devices. Different landing page URLs can be used for different platforms, or Ajax can be used to display different advertisement variants on a page.JavaScript and Responsive Web Design Google Developers CSS tables permit hybrid fixed+fluid layouts. There are now many ways of validating and testing RWD designs, ranging from mobile site validators and mobile emulators to simultaneous testing tools like Adobe Edge Inspect. The Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers and the Chrome console offer responsive design viewport resizing tools, as do third parties. Use cases of RWD will now expand further with increased mobile usage; according to Statista, organic search engine visits in the US coming from mobile devices has hit 51% and are increasing. Template for mobile and desktop app design. History The first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was Audi.com launched in late 2001,Kalbach, Jim (July 22, 2012). \\"The First Responsive Design Website: Audi (circa 2002).\\" created by a team at razorfish consisting of J√ºrgen Spangl and Jim Kalbach (information architecture), Ken Olling (design), and Jan Hoffmann (interface development). Limited browser capabilities meant that for Internet Explorer, the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for Netscape, the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized. Cameron Adams created a demonstration in 2004 that is still online. By 2008, a number of related terms such as \\"flexible\\", \\"liquid\\", \\"fluid\\", and \\"elastic\\" were being used to describe layouts. CSS3 media queries were almost ready for prime time in late 2008/early 2009. Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design (RWD)--and defined it to mean fluid grid/ flexible images/ media queries--in a May 2010 article in A List Apart. He described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled Responsive Web Design. Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by .net magazine after progressive enhancement at #1. Mashable called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design. Many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications due to its ability to house all of the code in a single website. Users and developers alike began realizing the benefits and importance of mobile-responsive designs as mobile use continued to rise. This realization of importance was confirmed when Google announced that search engines were going to reward responsive websites with increased rankings.

Biography Baderon succeeded his father, William fitzBaderon, as lord of Monmouth in about 1125, when his father either died or retired to become a monk. Baderon confirmed the possessions of the Priory at Monmouth granted by his predecessors, and extended them. His sister Margaret, whose son Robert became prior of Monmouth, and whose second husband, Hugh fitzRichard, was a landowner in Worcestershire, made further grants of land to the priory. Baderon also became responsible for Goodrich Castle, which he is believed to have developed and extended.Jeremy Ashbee, Goodrich Castle, English Heritage, 2005, , p.29 At some point after 1130 Baderon married Rohese (or Rohesia), the daughter of Gilbert fitzRichard de Clare, and the sister of Gilbert de Clare, who was the lord of Striguil (or Chepstow) and later became Earl of Pembroke. The marriage took place at Chepstow, and brought together the families of the two neighbouring, and sometimes rival, lordships. Baderon and Rohese had two sons, James and Gilbert, and at least one daughter, Rohese of Monmouth, who married Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, before 1155. He was a contemporary and possible kinsman of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who was born in the same town at around the same date. Baderon died in 1176. He was succeeded as lord of Monmouth by his son Gilbert, who was in turn succeeded by his own son, John of Monmouth, in 1190.

After graduation, he worked as financial expert at the Yugoslav National Bank in Belgrade until 1938 when he moved to the United States with a Rockefeller fellowship, \\"availing himself of the rich resources of Harvard University\\". In the United States, he first worked at the Food Research Institute of Stanford University as a member of their scholarly staff. During World War II he was affiliated with the Board of Economic Warfare and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Washington, D.C. After the war he first worked at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. In 1948 he joined the San Francisco State University and he taught there for twenty-five years until he retired in 1973.

The commissioners declared that this execution was illegal, as Hansford had had \\"no tryal or conviction by lawful jury.' In Maryland Digges became a merchant and planter in St. Mary's County. He married Elizabeth Sewall, widow of Dr. Jesse Wharton and a stepdaughter of Lord Baltimore, the Proprietor of Maryland. Immediately following his marriage he was appointed to the Governor's Council. He was also appointed Deputy Governor of Maryland.

In 1899 he joined the Foreign Service and spent the first years in Berlin. In 1901 he was sent as deputy consul to Cairo, Egypt, in 1902 to Cape Town, South Africa, and in 1904 to Maputo, Mozambique. From 1905 to 1908 he was a vice consul in Calcutta, India. From 1908 he worked in the legal department of the Foreign Office in Berlin. During World War I, he achieved the rank of major in the Royal Bavarian Landwehr, but was recalled to the Foreign Office in 1916. After the end of World War I, he was considering to continue scientific work at the University of W√ºrzburg, but was sent by the Foreign Office to the peace negotiations at Versailles. In the summer of 1920 he was sent as a charge d'affaires in Belgrade, where he was promoted to ambassador 18 December 1921. From 1924 to 1928, he served as ambassador to Brussels, Belgium. From 1928 to 1933 he was accredited as charg√© d'affaires of the German Reich government in Buenos Aires. In 1933 he was sent to represent Germany at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. In October 1933, he experienced the withdrawal of Germany from the League of Nations under the newly elected National Socialist government and chose early retirement. In 1935, he was reactivated as ambassador to Ankara, Turkey. He retired in 1938.Tobias C. Bringmann: Handbuch der Diplomatie 1815-1963, Verlag K. G. Saur, 2001, Seite 75f., bzw.

The first analysis of this method, when applied to the problem of minimizing a smooth convex function, was performed by Nesterov (2010). In Nesterov's analysis the method needs to be applied to a quadratic perturbation of the original function with an unknown scaling factor. Richt√°rik and Tak√°ƒç (2011) give iteration complexity bounds which do not require this, i.e., the method is applied to the objective function directly. Furthermore, they generalize the setting to the problem of minimizing a composite function, i.e., sum of a smooth convex and a (possibly nonsmooth) convex block-separable function: F(x) = f(x) + \\\\Psi(x), where \\\\Psi(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\Psi_i(x^{(i)}), x\\\\in R^N is decomposed into n blocks of variables/coordinates: x = (x^{(1)},\\\\dots,x^{(n)}) and \\\\Psi_1,\\\\dots, \\\\Psi_n are (simple) convex functions. Example (block decomposition): If x = (x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_5) \\\\in R^5 and n = 3 , one may choose x^{(1)} = (x_1,x_3), x^{(2)} = (x_2,x_5) and x^{(3)} = x_4 . Example (block-separable regularizers): # n=N; \\\\Psi(x) = \\\\|x\\\\|_1 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i# N = N_1 + N_2 + \\\\dots + N_n; \\\\Psi(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\|x^{(i)}\\\\|_2 , where x^{(i)}\\\\in R^{N_i} and \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|_2 is the standard Euclidean norm. Algorithm Consider the optimization problem : \\\\min_{x \\\\in R^n} f(x), where f is a convex and smooth function. Smoothness: By smoothness we mean the following: we assume the gradient of f is coordinate-wise Lipschitz continuous with constants L_1, L_2, \\\\dots , L_n. That is, we assume that :abla_i f(x + h e_i) - abla_i f(x)\\\\leq L_i |h|, for all x \\\\in R^n and h \\\\in R , where abla_i denotes the partial derivative with respect to variable x^{(i)}. Nesterov, and Richtarik and Takac showed that the following algorithm converges to the optimal point: Input: x_0 \\\\in R^n //starting point Output: x set x := x_0 for k := 1, ... do choose coordinate i\\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, uniformly at random update x^{(i)} = x^{(i)} - \\\\frac1{L_i} abla f_i(x) end for Convergence rate Since the iterates of this algorithm are random vectors, a complexity result would give a bound on the number of iterations needed for the method to output an approximate solution with high probability. It was shown in that if k\\\\geq \\\\frac{2n R_L(x_0)}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{f(x_0)-f^*}{\\\\epsilon \\\\rho}\\\\right), where R_L(x)=\\\\max_{y} \\\\max_{x^* \\\\in X^*} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\|y-x^*\\\\|_L : f(y)\\\\leq f(x) \\\\\\\\}, f^* is an optimal solution ( f^* = \\\\min_{x\\\\in R^n}\\\\\\\\{f(x)\\\\\\\\}), \\\\rho\\\\in(0,1) is a confidence level and \\\\epsilon>0 is target accuracy, then Prob(f(x_k)-f^*> \\\\epsilon) \\\\leq \\\\rho. Example on particular function The following Figure shows how x_k develops during iterations, in principle. The problem is : f(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} x^T \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) x -\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1.5 & 1.5 \\\\end{array} \\\\right)x,\\\\quad x_0=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ cc} 0 & 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right)^T File:Convergence on small problem.jpg Extension to block coordinate setting Blocking coordinate directions into Block coordinate directions One can naturally extend this algorithm not only just to coordinates, but to blocks of coordinates. Assume that we have space R^5. This space has 5 coordinate directions, concretely e_1 = (1,0,0,0,0)^T, e_2 = (0,1,0,0,0)^T, e_3 = (0,0,1,0,0)^T, e_4 = (0,0,0,1,0)^T, e_5 = (0,0,0,0,1)^T in which Random Coordinate Descent Method can move.

It takes its name from the Brianza, an area to the north-east of Milan, and from , a Lombard diminutive of merican \\"American\\". In early 2012 it was the only officially recognised Italian bantam breed. History The Mericanel della Brianza is named after the Brianza, a hilly geographical area which extends to the north and north-east of Milan, in the provinces of Monza e della Brianza, Lecco and Como, with a small part of the province of Milan. It is one of the few dwarf or bantam breeds in Italy, others being the Mugellese and the P√©poi. The Mericanel della Brianza is a traditional chicken breed of Lombardy, and was apparently selectively bred from local dwarf strains in the early 1900s. Recent attention from breeders has led to a phase of recognition, selection and recovery. In early 2012, the Mericanel della Brianza was the only Italian bantam breed officially recognised by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, the Italian federation of poultry breeders; the breed standard was approved in 1996. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 350 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 50 were cocks. Characteristics Eight colour varieties are recognised for the Mericanel della Brianza, including white, black, silver, gold, pyle and white-spotted black. The skin and legs are yellow. The comb is single, with 5 points and a pronounced rear lobe. The ear-lobes are red. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs vary from cream to light brown, and weigh approximately 35 g.

Officially formed in 2010, the group consists of guitarists Juz Cook and Ian Konrad, bassist Mike Radeck, and drummer Matt McRae. The band name is Greek for \\"Three Day\\", though referred to commonly as \\"Third Day\\", as it appears in the movie White Noise 2: The White Light. Tria Mera's musical style is heavy metal, but has been compared to the styles of modern European metal due to the melodicism found throughout their music. Since its formation, Tria Mera have released 2 EPs, been featured on multiple compilation albums, played several local festivals (including Australia's major heavy metal festival Soundwave Festival headlined by Iron Maiden), and won a QMusic Award for their song \\"A Burning Horizon\\". History Formation and early days (2006‚Äì2009) The original lineup. (left to right) Scott Moss. Mike Radeck, Juz Cook, Matt McRae, Ian Konrad The formation of Tria Mera goes back to 2006, where guitarist Juz Cook and drummer Matt McRae started jamming together in Cairns, Australia. After many months of playing together, they had a full lineup and setlist, mostly metal covers, ready to hit the local live scene under the name Deadrise. They played 3 shows and were featured on Channel 9 Local News before Juz was offered to join Echoed Silence, an already established band. While Echoed Silence was Juz's new full-time band, he and Matt continued to jam and write on the side, later pulling together the metal cover band they started for a few more shows. Eventually it became evident that to make it anywhere in the industry they would need to relocate to a bigger city. Matt moved to Brisbane in 2008, and Juz left Echoed Silence and soon followed in early 2009. There were many months of rehearsing new material before they found any new bandmates. Scott Moss, formerly of Brisbane metal band Minus Life, became the band's first frontman. Shortly followed by Mike Radeck on bass, and Ian Konrad on guitar. The lineup was finalised in April, 2010, officially named Tria Mera, the name that the project was given on Myspace by Juz in 2008. Six months of rehearsals followed before the band started tracking their debut EP in September with Ean Redman. The self-titled EP featured four songs; A Burning Horizon, Demonic Shadows, Blind By Reality and The Realm Beneath Us. First live shows and achievements (2010‚Äì2011) Tria Mera performing at an All Ages show in May, 2011 Before hitting the live scene, Tria Mera played a private house party to celebrate Scott and Ian's birthdays. The band's first public show was played on 26 November 2010, supporting the Australian band Lord. The band had pulled the majority of the crowd using the show as a chance to launch their debut EP and break into the local scene. Their efforts were recognised when JJJ stumbled across the band on their Unearthed website, hand- selecting Tria Mera to play the main stage at the Brisbane leg of the Soundwave Festival alongside Iron Maiden, Queens Of The Stone Age, One Day as a Lion, Slash, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Bullet for my Valentine, Stone Sour, Primus, Social Distortion, Feeder and MXPX/The Ataris. Also performing at the festival were Slayer, Dimmu Borgir, Murderdolls, Devildriver, Sevendust and Rob Zombie. Members of Tria Mera with Dez Fafara of Devildriver Performing at Soundwave opened up doors for Tria Mera, allowing them the opportunity to draw bigger crowds to local shows and build their reputation as a live band breaking out of the scene. In June 2011, original vocalist Scott Moss announced he was leaving Tria Mera due to ever-growing family and work commitments. The next day, the band began advertising the vacant frontman position and later organised one final farewell show, which was held in August. The success of the EP continued almost a year after its release when the band were nominated, and then won, a Queensland Music Award for their song \\"A Burning Horizon\\". The award was presented by Costa Zouliou, a former Triple J radio announcer. This helped to keep momentum while the band continued searching for a new frontman.

He was the son of Count Reinhard IV and his wife, Katharina of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg.  Regency  Philipp II of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg was only 11 years old when he inherited the county. A guardian and regent were needed for him and his seven years younger brother Balthasar. A regency council was installed by the Reichskammergericht at the recommendation of their mother, after she had consultad the lower nobility in the county. The council consisted initially of Philipp's mother and his great-uncle Count Johann V of Nassau-Dillenburg. Philipp's mother died in 1514 and Johann V was the sole regent until he died himself in 1516. After Johann's death, the Reichskammergericht appointed, at Philipp's recommendation, Johann's son, Count William I of Nassau-Dillenburg as regent. Wilhelm held the regency for five years, until Philipp was declared an adult in 1521, at the age of 20.  Reign  During the regency, Hanau- M√ºnzenberg joined the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. The start of the Reformation fell during Philipp's reign. However, it hardly effected the county. The German Peasants' War also happened in this period, but it only sporadically came to riots in Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. The Benedictine convent at Schl√ºchtern had to put itself under Philipp's protection, according to different sources either in Hanau or in Steinau an der Stra√üe, when rebellious peasants were approaching from Fulda. There were incidents in other towns in the country, for example in Orb, Partenstein, Preungesheim, Bornheimerberg and Niederrodenbach. The St. Wolfgang monastery in the Bulau forest near Hanau was devastated. In 1528, construction began of a new city wall surrounding Hanau. The city had grown outside its Medieval city wall and a new settlement had sprung into existence arounds today's Hospital street. The new wall would surround these newer parts of the city. It was the first implementation of a new defensive system designed by Albrecht D√ºrer. Construction took nearly 20 years. Simultaneously, the City Castle in Hanau was extended and strengthened. This project would take until 1560 to complete. The potential existed for a dispute between Philipp II and his seven years younger brother Balthasar about whether to obey the primogeniture statue and to give Balthasar only an apanage or to divide the county. When Balthasar's twentieth birthday approached, the regency council decided to opt for primogeniture. A treaty to this affect was drafted. However, Philipp II died before the treaty was sealed. This created a legal problem when Balthasar wanted to take up the regency for Philipp's sons, since his renunciation of his right to inherit and to reign was included in this draft treaty.  Death  Philipp II, Count of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg died on Easter Sunday of 1529, only 28 years old, leaving three surviving children and a pregnant widow. His funeral took place just one day later in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau, without any pump or circumstance, to spare his widow in her condition. The day after the funeral, she gave birth to his posthumous daughter Juliana. During the almost 200 years that Hanau-M√ºnzenberg existed, almost all counts died before their 30th birthday, leaving a minor to inherit the county. This is unlikely to be a coincidence, as it happened in nine successive generations. It suggests that the counts suffered from an inheritable disease, although it is unknown which disease that would be. The first of the nine counts to die early was Reinhard III.  Legacy  The new Hanau city gate was decorated with a portrait, carved in stone, of Philipp and Balthasar.See image at Meise, p. 49 The portrait was later put on display in the museum the Historical Society of Hanau. It was destroyed in a bomb attack on 19 May 1945, during World War II.  Marriage and issue  Juliana of Stolberg On 27 January 1523, Philipp II married Countess Juliana of Stolberg (15 February 1506 - 18 June 1580). They had five children: # Reinhard (10 April 1524 - 12 April 1525) # Katharina (1525‚Äì1581), married to Count Johann IV of Wied-Runkel # Philipp III (1526‚Äì1561) # Reinhard (1528‚Äì1554) # Juliana (1529‚Äì1595), married with Thomas, Wild- and Rhinegrave of Salm-Kirburg, and after his death with Count Herman of Manderscheid-Blankenheim After Philipp's death, Juliana married William I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg and had twelve more children.

The protagonist, Dr. Vincent Morrow, is a maverick doctor who specializes in \\"supernatural medicine,\\" supplementing common medical practices with magic. Dr. Morrow's \\"cases\\" predominantly involve infectious supernatural creatures like vampires, demonic possession, as well as elements based on the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft. In the first Witch Doctor mini-series, Dr. Morrow treats (and battles) a vampire, demons possessing a child, faerie changelings, and Deep Ones (crossed with the Creature From the Black Lagoon), among others. Dr. Morrow is assisted by Eric Gast, a paramedic who is apparently new to the world of the supernatural, and \\"Penny Dreadful\\", a college student who seems to be infected and controlled by a supernatural creature of some sort. While Dr. Morrow demonstrates the knowledge of a practicing medical doctor, his equipment and diagnoses are almost totally supernatural. He wields Excalibur, owns the Holy Grail (used predominantly as an IV or a syringe) and many other magical artifacts. Spellcraft is provided mostly by these artifacts, as well as pills and intravenous infusions (for example, Morrow swallows a \\"sleeping pill\\" in order to cast a spell to put a patient to sleep).  List of major characters  *Dr. Vincent Morrow *Eric Gast *Penny Dreadful  Reception  The first Witch Doctor mini-series was both a sales and a critical success for Skybound, earning praise from comics media sources like IGN, horror publications like Fangoria, and geek culture media sites including Boing Boing, io9, and The A.V. Club. Witch Doctor #1 was number 163 on Diamond Comics Distributors' top 300 chart for June, 2011, selling an estimated 12,592 copies. It was the fifth highest-selling title from Image Comics for that month, behind The Walking Dead #86, Invincible #80, Spawn #208 and Haunt #16. Witch Doctor #1 received a rating of 4 out of 5 from Comic Book Resources, a rating of 7.0 out of 10 from IGN, and a rating of 5 out of 5 from Comics Bulletin. Cory Doctorow gave Witch Doctor Vol. 1 a positive review on Boing Boing, calling it \\"charmingly demented\\" and stating \\"Ketner and Seifert's sensibility is perfectly potty, and their titular doctor is a blend of Doctor Who and Spider Jerusalem. The metaphysics they reveal through the gruesome adventures in this volume has a weird internal consistency, but it's so cockeyed and frankly revolting that I can honestly say it never occurred to me before they scarred me with it.\\" He concluded, \\"This is a fine debut, and I can't wait for future volumes.\\"  References   External links  * Official \\"Witch Doctor\\" Comic Sites:¬∑ Twitter ¬∑ Facebook Category:Skybound Entertainment titles Category:2011 comics debuts Category:Horror comics Category:Fantasy comics ","title":"Witch Doctor (comics)"},{"id":"34433018","text":"Elachista aphyodes is a moth of the family Elachistidae.

The first CASIC modes were interviewer-administered, while later on computerized self-administered questionnaires (CSAQ) appeared. It was coined in 1990 as a catch-all term for survey technologies that have expanded over time. Modes The most common modes of computer-assisted survey information collection, ranked by the extent of interviewer involvement, are: # CATI (Computer- assisted telephone interviewing) is the initial CASIC mode where a remotely present interviewer calls respondents by phone and enters the answers into a computerized questionnaire. # CAPI (Computer-assisted personal interviewing) was enabled by the introduction of portable computers where a physically present interviewer brings the computer with the questionnaire to the respondent and enters the answers into it. # CASI (Computer-assisted self- interviewing) is similar to CAPI but the respondent enters the answers on a computer of a physically present interviewer. Questions can also be presented in the form of audio (audio-CASI) or video clips (video-CASI). # CAVI (Computer-assisted video interviewing) is similar to CATI but the communication between a remotely present interviewer and the respondent is established via video chat. # Disk by mail includes a floppy or optical disk that is sent to the respondent. The interviewer is not present. # Touch-tone data entry (TDE) means that the respondent enters the answers by pressing the appropriate numeric keys on a telephone handset. The interviewer is not present. # Interactive voice response (IVR) includes a wide range of approaches for voice communication with a computer using the telephone. Modern speech recognition enabled IVR systems allow the respondent to provide complex answers through the telephone that are automatically recorded as text. The interviewer is not present. # Internet surveys include a variety of survey modes (e.g. mail, web) where the most widely used are web surveys. The interviewer is not present. # Virtual interviewer surveys are usually carried out via the Internet, where some kind of virtual interviewer introduces the questions to the respondent. Future technological developments will enable increased virtualization and interviewers will probably become completely computerized virtual characters. The interviewer is not present. Benefits Benefits of CASIC include: * Reduced time and costs for data input * Elimination of errors during data transcription * Implementation of advanced features, such as automatic skips and branching, randomization of questions and response options, control of answer validity, and inclusion of multimedia elements * Increased sense of privacy for the respondent * Reduced cost of research * Higher data quality due to the absence of interviewer-related bias.

History FEM was established in 1953 with two main purposes: (1) facilitating cooperation among materials handling manufacturers in Europe through their respective national committees and (2) creating state-of-the-art technical recommendations from the sector on the use of its equipment. 1993 marked an important change in FEM core activity with the establishment of the Internal Market (European Union) and the gradual increase in relevant regulatory requirements (firstly in the area of safety) originating from the EU. Consequently, in 2000 FEM Secretariat was moved to Brussels to be closer to the decision-making centre. Structure It represents 15 National Associations in 13 EU Member States, plus Russia, Turkey and Iran. FEM members represent more than 1,000 companies that employ 160,000 people directly in Europe. The industry has an annual turnover of ‚Ç¨62bn (2016). FEM office is located in the same building as Pneurop, Comit√© Europ√©en de l'Industrie de la Robinetterie or Orgalime, of which it is Associate Member. FEM is one of the sector associations Orgalime offers services to. FEM is organised in Product Groups that reflect the various industries under the materials handling heading: conveyors for bulk handling, crane and lifting equipment, elevating equipment, intralogistic systems, industrial trucks, mobile elevating work platforms, and racking and shelving. The constituent organisations include: * Agoria * VDMA - * The Federation of Finnish Technology Industries * CISMA * AISEM * DMH - Dutch Material Handling * FEM-AEM * TEKNIKF√ñRETAGEN * NRSEA * ISDER * BMHF Since 2018, FEM President is Jos De Vuyst from the company STOW. Function It holds a Congress every two years in the autumn. The last edition took place in Antwerp (2018). It was organised by AGORIA, the Belgian association. FEM is listed in the European Transparency Register.; FEM is organised in working bodies (Executive Committee, Technical & Regulatory Committee, topical working groups) that meet on a regular basis and several times a year. Activities A historical and still substantial part of FEM work lies in the production and update of technical recommendations on the use and maintenance of the various categories of materials handling equipment. FEM thus manages several dozens of recommendations. The other main activity consists in defending and promoting the interests of European materials handling manufacturers towards EU decision-makers in the context of relevant EU legislation. FEM is thus monitoring regulatory developments in several areas such as exhaust emissions of non-road mobile machinery, machinery, noise of equipment used outdoor, energy efficiency, resource efficiency, market surveillance... FEM also organises events (e.g. participation in CeMAT exhibition) and provides statistics on its industry to its members. In 2014 FEM confounded the World Materials Handling Alliance with American (MHI), Chinese (CMES, BMHRI) and Japanese (JIMH) colleagues. The Alliance exchanges information on trends, standards and regulations in the world materials handling industry. It meets once a year in conjunction with a major trade exhibition. Products Materials handling manufacturers produce mechanical equipment related to the movement, storage, control and protection of materials, goods and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption and disposal. Materials handling can be considered as an 'enabling' industry insofar as it fosters the efficiency of the various steps throughout the life cycle of products. Materials handling products are found in almost every manufacturing or distribution company. Materials handling has become more and more automated and integrated into complex systems. Materials handling equipment covers a wide variety of products including cranes, dock levellers, forklift trucks, adjustable shelving and pallet racking, aerial work platform, vertical conveyors, etc. Market surveillance Market surveillance consists in effective control, by responsible authorities, of products' compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Insufficient market surveillance in the EU has been identified as a major risk for the industry. Indeed, whereas a lot of regulations and directives apply to materials handling products, some competitors do not comply with the rules thus creating an unfair market and affecting the environment, workers' health and products'safety. FEM is therefore cooperating with other machinery industries (e.g. CECE ) to raise and address the issue at EU political level. FEM also created an Industry Support Platform together with the other trade associations to assist market surveillance authorities and market operators thanks to centralised technical guidance on conformity with various regulatory requirements.

History Keeley Compressor After graduating in electrical engineering from the University of Oklahoma, Robert Keeley started his company from his home in Oklahoma City in 2001. He initially hoped to build guitar amplifiers (he tweaked his father's Peavey Deuce), but found the market \\"highly saturated and becoming more so every day\\". Instead, while teaching at a small technical college and employing \\"some of his best students\\", he rebuilt and modified old effects units, starting with a Ross compressor. The industry for makers of hand-built effects at the time had few major players (Keeley named Mike Piera of Analog Man and Mike Fuller from Fulltone as his only competitors), and his business soon took off, aided by a reputation for quality and customers such as Brad Paisley. Rebuilt versions of the Ibanez TS9 were used by Peter Frampton, Jon Herington and Ike Willis; Keeley said he got his ideas for improving and tweaking existing effect pedals by reading commentary on various forums for guitar players. Since then, he develops his own pedals, starting with a boost pedal; his most popular effect is a compressor (first built in 2001), selling more than 27,000 copies. According to Guitar World, Keeley Electronics has grown into \\"one of the world‚Äôs top sellers of guitar effects pedals\\". Keeley claims that part of his success is due to carefully selecting electronic components with low tolerance. They opened up a second factory, where they make flight cases and guitar pickups; in 2009, the company briefly moved production of effect pedals there after a fire in the first factory. Keeley still builds custom-ordered and modified effects; assignments include tweaking an MXR Phase 90 for Donald Fagen and building a combined distortion/blues driver/wah for Neil Zaza.

It is a large mound made of shattered limestone blocks on the slopes of the Patom Highlands in an area of dense taiga. Its base diameter is about and its height about ; the cone's crown is ring-shaped, and in its center there is a smaller mound with a height of about . The volume of the crater is estimated as , with a weight of about one million tons. The Patomskiy crater was discovered in 1949 by Russian geologist Vadim Kolpakov. Its origins have been subject of intense scientific interest, with hypotheses including meteorite, volcanic and gaseous origin, but to date no definite proof has been given. It is estimated to be only 300 to 350 years old. Nearby trees seem to have experienced rapid growth that has been theorised to be caused by radiation. Theories of origin Until recently, some scientists believed that the crater presents a large footprint of an ultra-dense meteorite, which had sunk underground upon impact. Another hypothesis was that it is a fragment of the Tunguska meteorite. Others believed that the crater is a result of a breakthrough of a deep pocket of natural gas. Several scientific expeditions have been sent to the crater but the nature of its origin remains a mystery. Astronomers and geophysicists from the Irkutsk State Technical University, geochemists from the Institute of Geosphere Dynamics, RAS (Moscow), still believe that the crater may have a meteoric origin. Patom Crater Conference, 2010 In 2010, Saint Petersburg Mining Institute held a scientific conference \\"Patom Crater 2010\\". Viktor Sergeyevich Antipin, head of a department at the St. Petersburg Institute of Geochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IG SB RAS), stated that \\"Since the 2006 expedition by the Institute of Geochemistry (IGC), RAS came to the conclusion that the Patomskiy crater probably originates from geological processes. An important fact is that no serious argument or evidence of a meteorite crater nature referred to by specialists had been given. There was not any new evidence to support the meteorite hypothesis.\\" Antipin further noted that at the conference, for the first time, all the experts rejected the meteoric hypothesis. \\"Now it has only historical interest,\\" he added. According to studies of Siberian scientists, the crater formed only 300 to 350 years ago. The zoning of the crater was caused by geological processes and intensive introduction of deep gas flows of matter, which led to the transformation of silicate rocks within the crater. \\"An important confirmation of these ideas were the result of geophysics from Saint Petersburg Mining University and Yekaterinburg [Institute of Geophysics, UB RAS]. Performing gravimetric and geoelectrical investigations, they also came to the firm conviction that Patom crater has an origin of an endogenetic nature,\\" said Antipin. According to geophysicists of St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, meteorite impact craters have a very different shape, and Patom crater is not one of them, he added.

It is found only in Kashmir in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. It occurs on the lower abdomen and inner thighs and is due to the use of a kanger, a ceramic pot covered with wicker-work, carried as a source of warmth during cold weather. One of the earliest records of the condition was made in 1881 by surgeons at the Kashmir Mission Hospital and its cause was recognized in the early 20th century by Arthur Neve.Neve A (1900) Indian med. Gaz. 35, 81 Despite current knowledge of the cause of this condition, cases are still being reported. Other conditions associated with prolonged use of kangri in this fashion include erythema ab igne, a reticulate hypermelanosis with erythema.  Signs and symptoms  Most cases (80%) of squamous cell carcinoma attributed to ultraviolet radiation present in areas of the skin that are usually more exposed to sunlight (e.g., head, face, neck). Although a particular form of squamous cell carcinoma, Kangri cancer is more often associated with the abdomen, thigh, and leg regions due to the usage and positioning of kangri pots, which come in close contact with these anatomical features. Over time, the use of kangri pots to keep warm results in erythema ab igne, a precancerous keratotic growth that ‚Äútake the shape of superficial, serpegenous, reticular blackish brown colored lesions.‚Äù Eventually, the cells at the lesion site become more irregular in shape and form; the lesions ulcerate and may become itchy and bloody. The resulting irregular growth is the presentation of kangri cancer.  Risk factors  Use of the kangri pot is the princple cause of kangri cancer. The pot holds hot wood and charcoal, and is put in direct contact with the skin of the abdomen and the thigh areas as a way to keep warm during winter in northern India. Elements that are believed to contribute to the development of kangri cancer are heat, burning wood particles, smoke, soot, and tar of burnt chinar leaves. In one study, researchers found that kangri cancer patients had a history of using a kangri for 5-6 hours a day, 3-4 months a year.  Genetics  Beyond the behavioral risk factor of prolonged usage of kangri pots, researchers have begun to look at genetic mutations that may make some people more predisposed to develop kangri cancer. * In one study, people with kangri cancer were found to be approximately twice as likely as a control group to have a mutation in the TP53 gene (codon 72 polymorphism). Patients with higher grade tumors exhibited more proline amino acid mutations at this site. * Another study confirmed the association of kangri Cancer and TP53, finding substitutions and insertions in 40% of the kangri cancer patients studied. The researchers observed a significant correlation with mutation status and age as well as with the presence of affected lymph nodes in patients. TP53 may, in the future, serve as ‚Äúpotential molecular marker and prognostic tool‚Äù for kangri cancer. Furthermore, PTEN mutations were found in two of thirty patients studied; though due to the small sample size, no useful conclusions could be postulated. * Two polymorphisms of the HSP70 gene were discovered to be correlated with poor prognosis in cases of kangri cancer; the ‚ÄúHsp70-2 A/G or G/G and Hsp70homC/C genotypes‚Äù could potentially be utilized to measure risk of kangri cancer development as well as to predict prognosis. Diagnosis  Treatment   Surgery  In the treatment of kangri cancer, surgery is, most often, the first-line course of action to remove the primary tumor.  Radiotherapy  External beam radiotherapy has been used in one person to prevent the relapse and growth of tumor metastases to the head and neck regions. The prophylactic applications of radiation have been noted as ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù in this one case, reducing some tumors and eliminating others. Another study with a couple of the same authors found that radiotherapy after surgery helped with the reduction and cure of head and neck tumors in additional cases. The researchers suggest that external beam radiotherapy should be part of the treatment course for patients who have or at risk of developing tumors in the head and neck areas.  Prognosis  A research article from 1923 noted that the average life expectancy of those with kangri cancer was about fifteen months, though there have been records of people dying within one year and living for more than twenty years with kangri cancer. Updated life expectancy is not found in more recent scientific publications. However, in 2013, it was noted that the progression from erythema ab igne to squamous cell carcinoma was between one and two decades. It has been reported that about one-third to one-half of patients with kangri cancer show metastasis to local lymph nodes.  Epidemiology  The first case of kangri cancer was reportedly recognized in 1819. The incidence of kangri cancer is higher for those over age 50. There is no definitive predominance of kangri cancer in either males or females. Some studies may point to higher prevalence in males while others observed higher prevalence in females. In scientific literature, kangri cancer has only been attributed to the Kashmir region of northern India due to the traditional use of kangri pots. Kangri cancer is limited to this population, and thus, relatively little is known still, and there is much to be studied about the condition. In 2017, a local Kashmir media outlet,The Kashmir Reader, reported that researchers and health care providers are optimistic about the reduced incidence of kangri cancer, citing the rise of thermal clothing and electric heating sources that are now used in place of kangri pots to keep warm.

Situated on the border of Lowlands and Highlands, its products were generally classified as lowlands whisky. Auchentorlie Estate, along with a brewery call Littlemill, was purchased in 1750 by Archibal Buchanan from his brother Andrew Buchanan. It is unclear exactly when distilling started on this site however the gable end on one of the warehouses has a date stone carved with 1772. That same year accommodation was also built next door to the distillery to house the Excise officers who represented the law - and ensured any distillation was duly recorded and relevant taxes calculated. Justice of the Peace records for Dumbarton show that 'Robert Muir of Littlemiln', an employee, was granted the first ever licence by the Government of King George the 3rd to ‚Äú‚Ä¶retail ale, beer and other excisable Liquors.‚Äù on the 2nd of November 1773. Notably, Littlemill was one of the first distilleries to have a female licensee, Jane MacGregor, in 1823 who worked there under the ownership of Matthew Clark & Co who purchased the distillery in 1817. Later, in 1931, under the stewardship of the American Duncan Thomas, Littlemill was at the forefront of still innovation with technical designs that could create three styles of single malts from full-bodied to light. Around 1840 ownership went to Hector Henderson, who was also shareholder in the Campbelltown distillery in 1837 and founded the Caol Ila distillery. The distillery was rebuilt and expanded in 1875 by Hay, who then was the owner. Littlemill closed in 1929 until it was bought and reopened by Duncan Thomas in 1931, who experimented at the distillery with different new techniques. He used a new design of a Saladin box for malting with two ventilation towers and a single kiln. The copper pot stills were aluminium coated, and used rectifying columns instead of swan necks to have greater control over the distillation process, and production switched from a triple distillation to a double distillation technique. In 1971 the distillery changed hands to Barton Distilling, who had been a shareholder since 1959. Barton was bought by Amalgamated Distilled Products in 1982, which joined the Argyll Group in 1984. In this year the Littlemill distillery closed. It was reopened and bought by Gibson International in 1989, closed down again in 1994 after Gibson International went bankrupt, and was sold to Loch Lomond Distillery. It was dismantled in 1997, and the remnants of the distillery were destroyed in a fire in 2004. A housing development is now on the site. The distillery produced three different kinds of whisky, which was made possible through the rectifying columns on the stills: a heavily peated variety under the name \\"Dumbuck\\", a full bodied whisky named \\"Dunglas\\" and a light traditional lowland whisky under its own name \\"Littlemill\\". Dumbuck and Dunglas were discontinued in 1972. The remaining casks from Littlemill are currently at Loch Lomond Distillery with Loch Lomond Group releasing limited edition bottles. Loch Lomond Group have released four editions: Private Cellar aged 25 years, Private Cellar aged 27 years, 1992 Vintage and the oldest in the collection Celestial Edition aged 40 years. The latest addition to the Littlemill range ‚Äì Private Cellar aged 29 years - will be released in September 2019.

History In May 2010, Kensington-based artist Brian Dwyer, along with Christopher Powell, organized \\"Give Pizza Chance\\"‚ÄîPhiladelphia's first pizza-based art show‚Äîin which pizza served as muse for more than 25 artists who displayed their work at a local gallery. Inspired by the show's success, Dwyer became fascinated with the communal and seemingly boundless reach of pizza, seeking out more pizza- related memorabilia, with the intention of turning the pizza art exhibit into a yearly occurrence. In December 2010, Dwyer connected with Michael Carter, Joseph Hunter and Ryan Anderson via Circle of Hope, a Brethren in Christ church located in the Fishtown and East Kensington sections of Philadelphia. Carter, a business executive, left academic publishing to make meaningful investments in the renewal of his hometown. Hunter, a pizzaioli recently transplanted from South Carolina to Philadelphia, sought a venue where pizza could bring communities together., Anderson, a master carpenter worked on craft projects at the nexus of art and utility. In January 2011, the four formed a business to turn Dwyer's pizza art show into a business model- a pizzeria & museum where members of the community could connect and celebrate a common love of pizza. Together they curated the world's largest collection of pizza related items, earning a Guinness World Record in summer 2011. On September 7, 2012, Pizza Brain opened its doors to the public. (The company's name comes from the frequent misspelling of Dwyer's first name, in which the 'a' and the 'i' are transposed to spell 'Brain.'). Guinness World Record Guinness officially adjudicated Pizza Brain's collection before the company formed as an LLC. On July 31, 2011 Guinness World Records under individual category and Dwyer's name, Guinness certified the collection as \\"the world's largest collection of pizza-related items\\". Pizza Brain's Museum of Pizza Culture Pizza Brain's Guinness-certified collection is the core of its Museum of Pizza Culture, which is increasingly recognized as a food museum., Today, the collection ranges from the familiar (toys, puzzles, magazine ads, comic books, etc.) to the absurd - including a stainless-steel pizza cutter shaped like the USS Enterprise, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pizza Drop plinko arcade game circa 1990, an original Spanish poster print of the film Do the Right Thing and more than 150 vinyl 45s and LPs spanning 6 decades honoring pizza in song and lyric. Pre-open Press In December 2010, Dwyer met Joe Hunter, a pizza chef hailing from South Carolina interested in opening a community-minded pizzeria in his adopted home of Philadelphia. The following month in January 2011, businessman Michael Carter and master carpenter Ryan Anderson teamed up with Brian and Joe. Hunter immediately set to work on Pizza Brain‚Äôs unique pie concepts and flavor profiles. Carter provided curatorial direction to Dwyer‚Äôs collection and developed the business‚Äô strategic model, including its emphasis on content-rich social media. Anderson applied his considerable carpentry talents to the design of Pizza Brain‚Äôs physical space, making creative use of reclaimed and found materials. Dwyer continued to head sourcing of interesting pizza-related items to place on the company's Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram accounts. Collaboratively, the quartet turned an art show into the Pizza Brain museum and restaurant concept: a place that serves delicious artisan pies in a museum-like space that captures and commemorates pizza as a cultural icon. A cascade of additional articles followed as the Museum of Pizza Culture concept gained notoriety, including Zagat, The Huffington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer,Fox News, Food Network Magazine, Metro, Laughing Squid, and the magazine for Australia's national airline Qantas. NPR's All Things Considered also covered the story, as well as TV outlets like NBC 10, and Good Morning Sacramento. In September 2012, The New York Times, Associated Press, Cond√© Nast Traveler, USA Today, TIME, BBC Travel and The Guardian all profiled Pizza Brain during its opening month, garnering further national and international attention. On September 26, 2012, CBS This Morning aired a nationally televised news feature on the museum/restaurant, resulting in Pizza Brain being selected as a topic of discussion on Jeopardy!s Twitter account. Post-open Press Pizza Brain earned its first foodie award before it opened. The Guinness record and enthusiasm for its grand opening led to partner Dwyer being awarded the title of \\"Phoodie of the Year\\" from Philebrity.com, closely beating out candidates ?uestlove, Iron Chef America star Michael Solomonov, Philadelphia foodwriter and Green Aisle Grocery owner Adam Erace, and Tom McCusker aka 'Honest Tom' of Honest Tom's Tacos. Post-opening, under the direction of head chef Joe Hunter, Pizza Brain has established itself as one of Philadelphia's best pizza shops. It has received local, national and international recognition, for its creative pizza pies. Notable awards, reviews and lists include: 3 Philadelphia Magazine \\"Best of Philly\\" awards Business Insider's Best Pizza in Every State, Zagat's 10 Killer Slices of Pizza in Philly Nylon Magazine's 15 Best Pizza Slices in America, The Daily Meal's 10 Best Pepperoni Pizzas In America and Food Network's 50 Top Pizza Deliveries from Coast to Coast.

He was a sculptor, author, educator, Foreign Service officer, and a specialist on Arab and Islamic culture. His particular area of interest was Morocco. He was also an art critic and book reviewer for several newspapers and periodicals, including The Spectator. Life Born of Polish-German parents, Landau studied philosophy, art, and religion at various European schools and universities‚Äînotably in Germany‚Äîand spent his early years travelling and working as a sculptor. In 1922, whilst living in Berlin, he became the pupil of Georg Kolbe, then Germany's leading sculptor.See Landau (1936), Seven: An Essay in Confession (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson Ltd.), p. 69, ‚Äú(Georg Kolbe) was the creator of some of the finest modern statues, and we young sculptors looked up to him with an admiration that was almost religious.\\" During the late 1920s and early 1930s Landau established a minor reputation in Europe as a writer. His themes were art history, Polish biography (notably, Ignacy Jan Paderewski and J√≥zef Klemens Pi≈Çsudski), and comparative religion. Landau's best known book from these years was God is My Adventure (1935). Travels Rom Landau first visited Morocco in 1924. From that time he became a student of Islamic culture. Landau taught himself Arabic and spent as much time as he could afford living and travelling in North Africa and the Middle East. In 1937 he visited King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah I of Jordan, and other secular and religious leaders of the Middle East. Landau subsequently published a book, Arm the Apostles (1938), about his trip in which he advocates arming the Arabs so that they might aid the British and French in the coming war with Nazi Germany. Second World War Landau became a British citizen and served as a volunteer in the Royal Air Force (1939‚Äì41),See Landau (1945), The Wing: Confessions of an R.A.F. Officer (London: Faber and Faber). and subsequently a member of the Arab Committee of the Intelligence Department of the British Foreign Office (1941‚Äì45). During this period he published (with A. J. Arberry) the standard work Islam Today (1943). Following the war, Landau returned to North Africa where he established close personal ties with Sultan Mohammed V of Morocco, and other Arab leaders of liberation movements. Landau discreetly supported these groups although his interest in the cause of Arab independence would seem to have been motivated more by a traditionalist's wish to slow the modernisation and Europeanization of the region than to improve the living standards of the common people. Morocco Beginning in 1948 Rom Landau devoted his writing skills exclusively to Morocco and Moroccan affairs. Over the subsequent five-year period Landau published Invitation to Morocco (1950); Moroccan Journal (1951); The Beauty of Morocco (1951); The Sultan of Morocco (1951); Morocco (for the Carnegle Endowment for International Peace, 1952); Portrait of Tangier (1952); and France and the Arabs (1953). Later he would publish a historical study The Moroccan Drama 1900‚Äì1955 (1956), biographies of King Mohammed V (1957) and King Hassan II (1962), as well as a History of Morocco in the Twentieth Century (1963). Landau also wrote numerous essays and book reviews for The Reporter, the New Statesman, The Spectator, and other British and American periodicals of the day. Academic years Following a lecture tour to the United States (1952‚Äì53) Landau settled in San Francisco where he was employed by Frederic Spiegelberg's American Academy of Asian Studies, headed for a period by instructor Alan Watts. The Academy soon affiliated with the University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA (1954), and Landau subsequently became a professor of Islamic Studies at the university (1956‚Äì68). In 1962‚Äì63 he supervised the Peace Corps training program that prepared volunteers for service in Morocco. Following his retirement (1968), Landau settled in Marrakech, where he lived until his death.Adapted from \\"Biographical History\\" http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=landau-rom-1899--cr.xml God is My Adventure In his earlier career Landau wrote God is My Adventure (1935), a best-selling book in which he recounted his various contacts with leading figures and unusual persons of philosophical, religious, and mystical fame, such as Hermann Graf Keyserling, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Frank Buchman, Rudolf Steiner, G I Gurdjieff, P D Ouspensky, Meher Baba, and others. James Webb relates an encounter that Landau had with Gurdjieff in the latter's New York hotel room in the early thirties while Landau was writing \\"God is my Adventure.\\" \\"The interview went badly. Landau was discomposed by having unwanted cigarettes pressed upon him, and Gurdjieff did not intend to answer his questions. Even worse, the journalist appeared to be falling under some 'hypnotic influence' ‚Ä¶\\"Webb (1987), p. 421, The Harmonious Circle: The Lives and Works of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and Their Followers (Boston: Shambhala). According to Whitall Perry, \\"Explaining that he himself is not at all telepathic, given to mediumship, or subject to hypnotism, Landau says ‚Ä¶ In a few seconds he felt his body from the waist down penetrated with a growing weakness enough to render him incapable of leaving his chair had he tried. Only by mustering all his concentration in talk with the young attendant did he finally manage to extricate himself ‚Ä¶ Upon departing he was presented by Gurdjieff with a copy of his Herald of Coming Good; it was bound in imitation su√®de, but of a grain so abrasive it made the teeth grind at the very touch. Landau realized that this was all part of an effect deliberately calculated by the author‚Äîwhose book reads, moreover, as though conceived in clouds of Armagnac (the opening sentence alone, by Landau's count, contains not less than two hundred and eighty-four words).\\"Perry (1975), \\"Gurdjieff in the Light of Tradition Part III: The Phenomenon‚Äù (Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 9, No. 2., Spring, p. 2). Referring to the event, the Gurdjieffian, James Moore, describes Landau as \\"The lightweight sculptor and writer ‚Ä¶ greedy for copy, primed with sensational hearsay stories ‚Ä¶\\"Moore (1991), pp. 253‚Äì4, Gurdjieff: The Anatomy of a Myth (Longmead, Shaftsbury, Dorset: Element Books Ltd). Before meeting Gurdjieff, Landau recounts, ‚ÄúOne of his pupils said to me one day: ‚ÄòI imagine that Rasputin must have been like Gurdjieff: mysterious, domineering, attractive and frightening at the same time; full of overabundant vitality and of strange knowledge, inaccessible to other men.‚Äô His hypnotic powers were never disputed, yet all his external methods constituted but an insignificant part of his far wider knowledge.‚ÄùLandau (1935), p. 240, God is My Adventure: A Book on Modern Mystics, Masters and Teachers (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, Ltd.).

The duo is currently composed of Rodriguez and his Mexican-American wife, Evelyn Herrera.http://www.tercercielooficial.com/#bio:es:Evelyn Herrera Their biggest hits are \\"El uno para el otro\\", \\"Yo te extra√±ar√©\\", \\"Mi √∫ltimo d√≠a\\", \\"Creer√©\\", \\"Tu amor no es de este mundo\\" and \\"Demente\\". Their album Gente com√∫n, sue√±os extraordinarios, reached number one on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart in September 2009. Their albums have been well received in the Christian music genre in Latin America. They have sold more than 1,500,000 albums, which allowed them to travel to many Spanish-speaking countries to share an inspirational message using positive lyrics with a Biblical message and full of hope and life. Tercer Cielo sings not only Christian music but also includes love songs in their records, which opened doors in the world of secular music. They have received award nominations from around the world, including in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Orlando, and California. Tercer Cielo en otra dimension (23 April 2011) Hoy.com The group was a presenter at the 2011 Latin Billboard Music Awards. They made their Puerto Rico major-arena debut concert called En concierto \\"Creer√©\\" at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos√© Miguel Agrelot on 6 March 2010 and also performed on the Puerto Rican television reality show singing contest Yo Canto. They were nominated for Premio Lo Nuestro 2011, the 2010 Latin Billboard Music Awards and a 2011 Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Christian Album.  History  The group began when Juan Carlos Rodriguez and Marcos Yaroide sang in Christian events in their hometown of Santo Domingo. This then spread to churches and many charity concerts events, in which Tercer Cielo was formed. Through their music, Tercer Cielo supported the many churches financially and helped raise funds for many local ministries. Soon, word spread about this new duo and the group left their hometown, performing all around the country. It is said that one of their earlier concerts was attended by international Christian recording artists Freewill & JBG. The first song the group recorded was called \\"Ella y √©l\\", written by Juan Carlos Rodriguez. It had R&B; influences and told of the story of a young man who abandoned his Christian faith to go a world that offered him nothing but pain and suffering. Soon the song became a hit in their country and the group was showered with invitations to concerts and events like never before, prompting the need to record an album. The group received the support of fellow rookie record label Estribillo Music and recorded the album En ti, which was very successful and was #1 on national Christian radio. Songs on that initial album include \\"El rapto\\", \\"En ti no dejar√© de creer\\", and \\"Contigo estoy\\". Among their other successes are \\"No importa\\", that won in 2007 two AMCL Awards for \\"Song of the Year\\" and \\"Composition of the Year\\". Juan Carlos Rodriguez was given the award for Songwriter of the Year. In 2009, they had two major successes: \\"Creer√©\\" and \\"Mi √∫ltimo d√≠a,\\" both of which were nominated for AMCL Awards in the category \\"Song of the Year\\". \\"Mi √∫ltimo d√≠a\\" was winner of \\"Song of the Year\\". In 2011, they produce \\"Tu amor no es de este mundo,\\" winner of \\"Song of the Year\\" at AMCL Awards 2011.  Change of members  In 2006, Marcos Yaroide decided to leave the group to form a solo career, which caused controversy among the media. Many fans and media thought it was due to disagreements between Yaroide and Rodriguez. Rodriguez and Yaroide later admitted in interviews that he had made his own decision to start a solo career, due to his desire to be a pastor. Juan Carlos then decided to include his wife Evelyn Herrera as a new member of Tercer Cielo, arousing great curiosity in the artistic and Christian world. Many fans wanted to hear the seriousness of the new project.

The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Lithoconus M√∂rch, 1852 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is large, thick and obconic in shape, and the shoulders are subangular. The protoconch is multispiral, and the whorl tops are usually concave in cross section and have just one or two cords. The shell is ornamented with nodules which are obsolete but present. The anal notch is shallow to moderately deep, depending upon the species.

The periostracum is smooth and very thick, and the operculum is large. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth may be shorter or significantly longer than the length of posterior section, and the blade is long and covers most of the anterior section. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has several rows of coarse denticles. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the occur in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on a variety of polychaete worms, including enteropneust, eunicid, capitellid, and nereid worms.

His most famous song is \\"Keep yor feet still Geordie hinny\\". He was a contemporary of George \\"Geordie\\" Ridley. He wrote and sang in the Geordie dialect of Newcastle upon Tyne, his native speech. Biography Joseph \\"Joe\\" Wilson was born just before his twin brother, Tom, in Stowell Street, Newcastle upon Tyne. His father was a cabinet-maker, his mother a bonnet-maker. He enjoyed singing from an early age and had a fine treble voice, which led to his becoming a choir boy at All Saints' Church. At age 14, he went to work as an apprentice printer with Howe Brothers of Gateshead. He started writing songs as a hobby, and by age 17 published his first book, managing to publish and distribute it independently. He later arranged for the printing to be done at Howe Brothers. Wilson started performing professionally in 1864 and became a regular at the Wheat Sheaf in the Cloth Market. He later moved to the newer, larger Tyne Concert Hall. He then toured the North of England, selling his home-produced song-books like most artists of the day (for a halfpenny each). He married in 1869, and two years later tried settling down to a less itinerant lifestyle. In 1871 he became publican of the Adelaide Inn on New Bridge Street, Newcastle. He was a publican for about a year, then he went back on the road, singing and writing. His act now included many \\"teetotal\\" songs, as he had taken the pledge. Commercial Hotel, WinlatonHis health failed when he contracted tuberculosis, as his father had. A friend and colleague Rowly Harrison, publican of The Commercial in Winlaton, allowed Wilson to stay with him, as his pub was at a higher elevation, and therefore thought to have cleaner, more bracing air. Joe Wilson died of tuberculosis in Railway Street, Newcastle, survived by his wife and three young children. He was buried in the Jesmond Old Cemetery where a monument marking his grave was erected sometime afterward. The inscription on the monument is in his own words: \\"It's been me aim t'hev a place i'th' hearts o' the Tyneside people, wi' writin' bits o'hyemly sangs aw think they'll sing.\\" Legacy Joe Wilson was probably the most prolific of all the Geordie songwriters of the time. He performed his own works in the various halls of entertainment around the region until he became too ill. Many of his songs were published in his book Songs and Drolleries, and also in Allan's Tyneside Songs and Readings. Works Wilson's songs were published during his lifetime, as well as after his death. This is a partial list from Songs and Drolleries. *\\"Keep yor feet still Geordie hinny\\" to the tune of \\"Nelly Gray\\"/\\"Maggie May\\" *\\"Come Geordie ha'd the bairn\\" *\\"Aa hope ye'll be kind ti me dowter\\" *\\"The Row upon the Stairs\\" *\\"Dinnet clash the door\\" *\\"The time that me fethur was bad\\" *\\"The Gallowgate Lad\\" *\\"The Lass That Lives Next Door\\" *\\"Narvis Johnny\\" *\\"Sally Wheatley\\" *\\"Through Drinking Bitter Beer\\" See also *Geordie dialect words Notes References External links * \\"Tyneside Song\\", 2009 article by Pete Wood in Music Traditions\\" * Wor Geordie dialect ‚Äì The songwriters * Joe Wilson's grave at Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery * Category:English singers Category:English songwriters Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne (district) Category:1875 deaths Category:1841 births Category:Geordie songwriters Category:19th-century English singers ","title":"Joe Wilson (Geordie singer)"},{"id":"34433755","text":"Brugmansia vulcanicola, ( = \\"the volcanic-soil-favouring angel's trumpet\\" ) is a shrub or small tree belonging to the genus Brugmansia of tribe Datureae in subfamily Solanoideae of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.

According to his hatchment, Fox came from an influential family from Franconia (Germany). As a military commander he became involved in the war between the Vetkopers and Schieringers in Friesland and Groningen. In 1495 he occupied Bolsward and the town of Workum had to pay money to stay safe. Later on Fox and his army sought shelter in Sneek. The Schieringers Bokke Harinxma and grietman Louw Donia tried to flee the city, but were imprisoned by Fox. Fox demanded ransom for these two men. The people of Sneek asked the city of Groningen to help out. Fox left the country in May 1496, after the ransom was paid. In 1498 Fox and his army raided the Westerkwartier in the province of Groningen. He was employed by the duke of Saxony, Albert III, who together with Edzard I struggled for power in the northern parts of the present Netherlands. This led to a battle at Noordhorn between Fox's army and the army of the city of Groningen. This battle was won by Fox's army, but Fox's army officer Jurjen van Reijnsberg was killed. To get revenge, Noordhorn and Zuidhorn were burnt. The Saxon army also occupied the monastery of Aduard. The chieftains of the Ommelanden negotiated with Fox to avoid further destruction and paid ransom. In July 1499 Fox clashed with the Groningers again. This time at the Vrouwenlaan (Women's Avenue) close to the village of Foxhol. According to tradition he got wounded, but continued to fight. He was eventually killed. In recognition of his qualities as a warrior, Fox's body was buried in the church of the Franciscan monastery in the city of Groningen by his opponents. His gravestone contained the following text: The hatchment that was hung at his grave disappeared during or before 1743, but the Latin text has been preserved.

His landholdings around Swanscombe are considered to possibly constitute a feudal barony. Although he was at Stephen's court in early 1136, by 1138 Talbot was supporting Stephen's rival, Matilda. After escaping capture twice, Talbot was captured by partisans of Stephen but was released. In 1139 and 1140, Talbot was engaged in military operations around Hereford, which included fortifying Hereford Cathedral in an attempt to take Hereford Castle. Early life Talbot was the son of Geoffrey Talbot, who owned lands at Swanscombe in Kent. The younger Talbot's mother was Agnes, wife of the elder Talbot. Her ancestry is unclear, with David Crouch stating she was a member of the de Lacy family. The Complete Peerage states she was probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy and Emma, and sister of Roger and Hugh de Lacy.Cokayne Complete Peerage IX pp. 424-425 Note Katharine Keats- Rohan, however, states that Agnes was probably the daughter of Helto Dapifer.Keats-Rohan Domesday People p. 231 Talbot's father is recorded as the holder the lands around Swanscombe in the 1166 Cartae Baronum, which states that the elder Talbot had the lands sometime before his death and that they passed to the younger Geoffrey. These holdings around Swanscombe are considered by some historians as probably comprising the feudal barony of Swanscombe. The family was connected in some way with the de Lacy family, as the younger Geoffrey named Gilbert de Lacy as his relative. According to David Crouch, Agnes was Gilbert de Lacy's aunt, which if true would make de Lacy and Talbot first cousins. He was also a relative of Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn, who was his heiress.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 1122 He probably served as a household knight for Robert, the Earl of Gloucester. Stephen's reign Talbot was present at the Easter court held by King Stephen at Westminster in 1136, along with a number of other nobles, magnates, and ecclesiastics.King King Stephen pp. 56‚Äì60 In April 1138, his force took the town of Hereford from the supporters of King Stephen,Crouch Reign of King Stephen pp. 78‚Äì80 and footnotes 16 and 21 and held it for Stephen's rival and cousin, the Empress Matilda.Chibnall Empress Matilda p. 78 This was part of a concerted rebellion by Matilda's supporters, many of whom were connected with Matilda's half-brother Robert, the Earl of Gloucester. Talbot may have been the chief instigator of the rebellion. By mid-May, Stephen was besieging Talbot in Hereford Castle, a siege that lasted until mid-June, when the castle surrendered. The garrison was allowed to leave unharmed,King King Stephen p. 86 but Talbot escaped, and fled to the de Lacy castle at Weobley Castle, which also was besieged and surrendered. Again, Talbot escaped capture and fled to Bristol, where Matilda's supporters were gathering. Talbot and de Lacy then launched an attack on the town of Bath. While scouting, the two men were attacked by forces from the city, and Talbot was captured by forces under the control of the bishop of Bath, Robert of Lewes. The Empress' forces then arranged a parley with the bishop and offered him a safe conduct, but when the bishop showed up at the meeting, he was threatened with hanging unless Talbot was released. The bishop released Talbot under duress. The release affected the bishop's relations with Stephen, who accused the bishop of supporting Matilda, and was only with difficulty persuaded to accept the bishop's explanation.King King Stephen pp. 87‚Äì88 In October 1139, Talbot was once more in charge of Hereford and withstood an attack by Miles of Gloucester, at that time a supporter of King Stephen.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 112 By 1140, he had lost control of the castle and was attempting to regain control of it. Part of his efforts included fortifying Hereford Cathedral.Davis and Bearman \\"Unknown Coventry Charter\\" English Historical Review p. 535 footnote 2 He was joined in his siege efforts by Miles of Gloucester, who had switched sides and was then supporting Matilda.Marritt \\"Reeds Shaken by the Wind?\\" King Stephen's Reign p. 121 Death and legacy Talbot died in about 1140, and his lands passed to Sybil, and her second husband, Josce de Dinan.Coplestone-Crow \\"Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle\\" Shropshire History and Archaeology p. 181 He was buried in Gloucester Abbey.Marritt \\"Reeds Shaken by the Wind?\\" King Stephen's Reign p. 123 The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son of Miles of Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, but she had no children by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands passed to the heirs of her sister Agnes. Cecily's death without heirs also meant that the feudal barony of Swanscombe passed to her sister's heirs. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out.

Former members Kris, Luhan, and Tao departed the group amid legal battles in 2014 and 2015. The band was formed by SM Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in 2012. Their music‚Äîreleased and performed in Korean, Mandarin, and Japanese‚Äîprimarily incorporates pop, hip-hop, and R&B;, including elements of electronic dance music genres such as house and trap. The band ranked as one of the top five most influential celebrities on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list from 2014 to 2018 and have been labeled \\"Kings of K-pop\\" by various media outlets. The band debuted with twelve members separated into two sub-groups: Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members Kris, Luhan, and Tao). Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively, until the release of their third EP Overdose in 2014. Since 2014, Exo have exclusively performed as one group while continuing to release and perform music in multiple languages. Members Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted as the sub-unit Exo-CBX in 2016, and members Sehun and Chanyeol began promoting as the sub-unit Exo-SC in 2019. Each member also maintains solo careers in music, film and television. Exo's first album XOXO (2013), released alongside breakthrough single \\"Growl\\", was a critical and commercial success; it sold over one million copies, which made Exo the first Korean artist to do so in twelve years. Their later works also had strong sales, with their Korean studio albums each selling over one million copies. Exo's sixth album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo (2018), became their highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200, debuting at number 23, and their best selling album in South Korea, with over 1.9 million copies sold. Exo have won numerous awards throughout their career, including five consecutive Album of the Year awards at the Mnet Asian Music Awards and two consecutive Artist of the Year awards at the Melon Music Awards, and have performed over 100 concerts across four headlining tours and multiple joint tours. Outside of music, the band members have endorsement deals with brands such as Nature Republic and Samsung and participate in philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, an ongoing project by SM Entertainment and UNICEF that began in 2015.  Background  In 2011, SM Entertainment CEO, Lee Soo-man, revealed plans to debut a new boy band that would be divided into two sub-groups, promoting the same music simultaneously in South Korea and China by performing songs in both Korean and Mandarin. After several member changes in December 2011, the group finalized its name as Exo, taken from the word \\"exoplanet\\". The news of an upcoming debut from SM Entertainment attracted substantial media attention from within South Korea and internationally, with many comparing Exo to fellow SM boy band TVXQ. It was also reported that Exo would compete with a new girl group from rival YG Entertainment. History 2006‚Äì2012: Formation and early years Exo at SM Town Live World Tour III in Singapore in November 2012 Exo-K's leader, Suho, was the first member to join SM Entertainment, after a successful audition through the company's casting system in 2006. The following year, Kai, with encouragement from his father, auditioned at the SM Youth Best Contest; he won and received a contract. Chanyeol, who took second place in a Smart Model Contest, and Sehun, who went through four auditions in two years, were the next members to become trainees in 2008. In 2010, Exo-K's D.O. sang for his audition and was eventually offered a contract. The last member of Exo-K to become a trainee was Baekhyun, who joined in 2011 through SM Entertainment's casting system and trained for approximately one year before debut. In Exo-M, Kris auditioned in 2008 at a global SM Entertainment audition in Canada, before moving to South Korea for training. That same year, Lay auditioned in Changsha, China, and subsequently moved to South Korea, while Xiumin attended an audition with his friend and won second place. In 2010, Luhan was scouted by an SM Entertainment representative in Seoul and passed his audition, while Tao was scouted at a talent show. The last member to join Exo-M was Chen, who took part in the casting system in 2011. The band's first televised performance was at the annual SBS Gayo Daejeon event on December 29, 2011. Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single \\"Mama\\" on April 8, 2012, followed by the EP Mama on April 9. The two sub-groups promoted the album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program The Music Trend while Exo-M performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in Shenzhen on the same day. The Korean version of the EP peaked at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and at number eight on the Billboard World Albums Chart, while the Mandarin version reached number two on China's Sina Album Chart and number one on various Chinese streaming platforms. Prior its debut, Exo released two singles, titled \\"What Is Love\\" and \\"History\\", which peaked at number 88 on and number 68 respectively on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number six on the Sina Music Chart. Exo was awarded Best New Asian Group at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards and the Newcomer Award at the Golden Disc Awards. 2013‚Äì2014: Commercial success Exo with South Korean President Park Geun-hye in China on June 28, 2013 The group's first studio album, XOXO, was released on June 3, 2013, in two versions: one in Korean and one in Mandarin. Unlike the EP Mama, for which Exo-K and Exo-M had separate promotions, XOXO was jointly promoted, mainly in South Korea. Exo recorded the album's lead single \\"Wolf\\" together, but the rest of the album tracks were recorded separately. A repackaged version of the album, titled Growl, was released on August 5, 2013, with three additional tracks. New single \\"Growl\\" peaked at number three on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 and at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. All versions of XOXO collectively sold over one million copies, making Exo the first South Korean artists to reach that milestone in 12 years. That December, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December, as a special winter album containing the single of the same name. Prior to the release, the group promoted the album through their first reality show, Exo's Showtime, which premiered on November 28, 2013 on the cable channel MBC Every 1. Following their 2013 releases, Exo won Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards for \\"Growl\\", Disc Daesang at the Golden Disc Awards and Album of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards for XOXO, and the Daesang at the Seoul Music Awards. In addition, Exo-M received the Most Popular Group Award at the 2013 Top Chinese Music Awards. Exo's third EP, Overdose, was released on May 7, 2014. Originally scheduled to be released on April 21, the album was delayed due to the Sewol Ferry accident on April 16. Overdose was promoted similarly to Mama, with Exo-K in South Korea and Exo-M promoting primarily in China. The album had over 660,000 pre-orders, making it the most pre-ordered Korean EP in history. The Korean edition also peaked at number two on Billboards World Albums Chart, and at number 129 on the Billboard 200, making Exo the highest- ever charting male Korean group at that time. Overdose became the best selling release of 2014 in South Korea, and was the first EP to top the yearly charts and win the Album of the Year Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. On December 22, Exo released their first live album, Exology Chapter 1: The Lost Planet The album's single, \\"December, 2014 (The Winter's Tale)\\", peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it Exo's first number one single. By the end of 2014, Exo was Japan's best-selling K-pop artist of the year. On May 15, 2014, Kris filed a lawsuit against Sm Entertainment to terminate his contract and alleged that SM: disregarded his health; maintained unfair profit distributions; restricted his freedom; and treated him like a product rather than a person. On May 24, the group began its first headlining tour, \\"Exo from Exoplanet 1 ‚Äì The Lost Planet\\", at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena. Tickets for the concert sold out in 1.47 seconds, breaking the record for the quickest concert sell-out by a Korean artist. On October 10, Luhan also filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. He cited health problems and alleged he was treated differently than the band's Korean members. 2015: Critical acclaim D.O, Lay, and Kai at the 24th Seoul Music Awards in January 2015 On March 7, 2015, Exo began their second headlining world tour, \\"Exoplanet 2 ‚Äì The Exo'luxion\\", with 70,000 attendees across five nights at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. The group released its second studio album Exodus on March 30, 2015, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album surpassed 500,000 copies within 24 hours, setting a new record for pre-orders. Lead single \\"Call Me Baby\\" was released ahead of schedule, on March 27, because versions of the song had been leaked online. The music videos were released four days later; the Korean version later became the most-watched K-pop music video of the first half of 2015. The album spent a record four consecutive weeks at number one on the Gaon Album Chart4 Consecutive weeks at #1 for Exodus:   and sold over a million copies, making it Exo's second album to do so, after XOXO. Exodus won Album of the Year at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards, giving Exo their third consecutive win. In April 2015, Exodus peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard 200, making the group the highest charting Korean artist. Exo also entered Billboard's Canadian Hot 100 chart at number 98, making them the first K-pop group and second Korean artist to chart there. Tao was absent during promotions for Exodus due to injuries and, on August 24, became the third member to file a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. This followed social media posts earlier in the year from Tao's father on Chinese social network Weibo, expressing his wish for his son to withdraw from the group and return to China due to health issues and a lack of support for individual career development. SM responded to his legal action with a statement: \\"Our company plans to use everything in our power including both Korean and Chinese legal professionals and partners to respond legally both in Korea and China in a multi-faceted manner. We also plan to take legal steps to respond to Tao's illegal promotions and actions.\\" Exo released a repackaged version of Exodus, titled Love Me Right, on June 3, 2015. This edition added four new songs, including the single \\"Love Me Right\\". Due to Tao's absence, the group promoted the song as nine members. That October, Exo became the first artists to hold a dome concert in South Korea; it was called \\"Exo ‚Äì Love Concert in Dome\\", and took place at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. On November 4, 2015, Exo released their Japanese debut single Love Me Right ~romantic universe~, which contains the Japanese version of \\"Love Me Right\\" and an original Japanese song titled \\"Drop That\\". On the day of its release, the album sold 147,000 copies and reached the top of the Oricon chart, becoming the all-time best-selling debut single in Japan by a Korean artist. Five days later, Exo released a special single titled \\"Lightsaber\\" to promote the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens ahead of its release in South Korea, as part of a collaboration between SM Entertainment and Walt Disney. On December 10, Exo released its second winter special release and fourth EP, Sing for You, containing the singles \\"Sing for You\\" and \\"Unfair\\". The album sold 267,900 copies in its first week, breaking the record for the highest first-week sales by a Korean artist. \\"Unfair\\" also became the first K-pop song to be featured in the \\"Best of the Week\\" playlist by Apple Music, and Exo became the first Korean artists to appear on the platform's homepage. Part of the profits from the album were donated to UNICEF's Smile For U campaign, to support the music education for children in Asia. In December 2015, South Korean entertainment industry leaders ranked Exo at number seven in the top ten pop culture leaders of 2015, the highest rank held by a K-pop artist.  2016‚Äì2017: Worldwide success  Exo at Ex'act release press conference in June 2016 On January 5, 2016, SM Entertainment won one of its countersuits against Tao following the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The company sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure; it released an official statement that said: \\"SM has ongoing lawsuits against Exo members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment.\\" Exo's third studio album Ex'Act and its singles, \\"Lucky One\\" and \\"Monster\\", were released on June 9, 2016, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album exceeded 660,000 copies, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album ever at that time. The album broke the record for the highest first-week sales of a Korean album, previously set by the band's own fourth EP Sing For You. \\"Monster\\" became Exo's first number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, and \\"Lucky One\\" debuted at number three. On August 18, 2016, a repackaged edition of the album, titled Lotto, was released; it added four new songs, including the single of the same name. \\"Lotto\\" became Exo's second number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs Chart, and peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. The repackaged edition's Korean and Mandarin versions reached number one and two on the Gaon Album Chart, respectively Within two months of its original release, Ex'Act had sold over 1.17 million copies, becoming Exo's third album to sell over one million copies, earning them the title of \\"triple million sellers\\" from the media. On July 21, contractual disputes between Kris and Luhan and SM Entertainment were settled. The two sides settled during their third court-mandated arbitration; the previous two were held in September 2015 and June 2016, when the court settled the case with a recommendation for reconciliation.

Exo-CBX has released one studio album: Magic (2018) and three extended plays: Hey Mama! (2016), Girls (2017), and Blooming Days (2018). Exo-SC In July 2019, SM Entertainment formed the group's second sub-unit, Exo-SC, which is composed of members Sehun and Chanyeol. Exo-SC has released one studio album: 1 Billion Views (2020) and one extended play: What a Life (2019).  Artistry   Musicality  Exo are considered by many to be a vocal powerhouse in the K-pop industry; the group's three main vocalists D.O., Chen, and Baekhyun have received praise from industry figures and the media. Beginning in 2013, Exo has released special winter-themed EPs in December nearly every year. These EPs feature many classic, emotional ballads, diverging from the dramatic and upbeat singles usually featured on the band's full-length albums. Billboard applauded the band's single \\"Universe\\" from the 2017 EP of the same name, saying, \\"With soaring, emotive vocals courtesy of the Exo members, 'Universe' is a power ballad that showcases the group's strengths.\\" The group has frequently worked with veteran Korean and international producers, including Kenzie, Dean, LDN Noise, The Underdogs, and MARZ Music. Many of Exo's songs ‚Äì especially the singles, which blend pop, hip-hop, and R&B; with electronic dance music genres like house, trap, and synth-pop‚Äì are produced with onstage performance in mind.  Producer Harvey Mason Jr. commented: \\"We listen to their material ... and try and go one step further. We try and do things that are fresh and original but yet still sound like Exo. ...They can sing, they can dance, they have the energy ... It's like a painter having every color to paint with.\\" Early in their career, Exo were described by Billboard as sounding \\"wholly inspired by the late '90s/early '00s sound ... with bigger beats, loads more hooks and adding rap and dance breakdowns.\\" The group explored a more \\"mature\\" and \\"dark\\" sound in 2016 with the release of their third studio album, Ex'Act, featuring an increased use of electronic dance music styles like house and synth-pop. Their fourth studio album, The War, deepened the group's experimentation with genre, including the addition of trap music. With the album's single \\"Ko Ko Bop\\", Exo received praise for unconventionally hybridizing laid-back reggae sounds with heavy electronic breaks.  Songwriting  Exo's members faced criticism early in their careers because of their lack of involvement in the writing and producing of their songs. However, in 2015, Exo released their first song to credit lyrics to one of the group's members on the repackaged version of their second album, Love Me Right. \\"Promise (Exo 2014)\\" was written by Chanyeol, Chen, and Lay and was a \\"special gift\\" to the fans, with lyrics thanking them for their support. Since then, Exo have released multiple songs featuring lyrical contributions from the band's members, including \\"Heaven\\" and \\"She's Dreaming\\" from their third album, the special promotional single \\"Lightsaber\\", and most notably, the hit single \\"Ko Ko Bop\\" among others from their 2017 album The War. In a 2017 interview with Billboard, Chanyeol spoke about his contributions to the lyrics for \\"Chill\\", stating that because he \\"worked on the lyrics with an empty track without demo lyrics\\", the process came more \\"naturally\\" to him. Chen explained the process of writing their single \\"Ko Ko Bop\\": \\"[we] wrote the lyrics separately and worked on putting [them] together for the song afterwards. I don't think I have any regrets [about the song] since it's the best result produced through all the effort that our members and other writers have put into the process.\\" Chen was also credited with writing the Korean lyrics for the track \\"Lights Out\\" from Exo's fourth special winter EP, Universe. Member Lay is also a songwriter and producer, having written and composed all tracks on his solo albums, as well for other artists. Chanyeol participated in writing lyrics for \\"Gravity\\" and 'With You\\", both on Exo's sixth studio album Don't Mess Up My Tempo.  Stage  Exo performance using water on stage in Bangkok during Exo Planet 3 ‚Äì The Exo'rdium in 2016. Exo have been praised for their synchronized choreography and elaborate stage designs. The band was choreographed early in their career by American hip hop choreographers Tony Testa and Nicholas Bass for songs like \\"Wolf\\" and \\"Growl\\", respectively. More recently, Exo collaborated with choreographer Kim Tae Woo. Dazed admired the band's \\"seamless...knife-point choreography\\", saying it has put them \\"at the forefront of pop domination\\". A recurring stage element on the group's world tours has been the use of water in the form of rain and shallow pools. Cleo noted that Exo's \\"winning formula\\" was the incorporation of water into their choreography, describing the water \\"cascading from above during 'White Noise' and 'Lightsaber'\\" that \\"saw some of the members getting drenched.\\" Yahoo wrote that \\"during one segment, the boys stood on an elevated hexagon-shaped stage (modeled after the band's logo), and danced sensually while water rained down on them from above.\\" On their stage design, Music Mind noted Exo's use of \\"not only ... the stage-lights and the lightsticks, but also [a] multitude of special effects like water, flames, and fireworks, not to mention huge screens positioned both on the substage and across the whole perimeter of the venue\\". Rappler journalist Keb Cuevas described Exo's \\"multi- LED screen stage fitted with holographic Exo embellishments and choreographed laser lighting\\", saying \\"the stage was literally on fire as pyrotechnic effects were ignited with the electronic beat.\\" Covering a 2018 concert in Singapore, Bandwagon remarked that after their \\"fourth headlining tour [in] four years ... you might [assume] their setlist and stages would be repetitive and stale. But [that] was not the case at all.\\" Awards and achievements Exo at the 16th Mnet Asian Music Awards in December 2014 Exo have won numerous awards both in South Korea and internationally. The band earned their first- ever music show win in June 2013 for their single \\"Wolf\\" on Korea's Music Bank, a music program that recognizes the week's most popular song in the country based on digital chart performance, album sales and social media popularity. Exo hold the record for the most music show wins for a single song, with 18 for \\"Call Me Baby\\" (2015). The band have won over 100 music program awards cumulatively, becoming the second act to do so after their label-mates Girls' Generation. Exo have also received 23 Daesang (\\"grand prize\\")  awards from various year-end award shows. Exo Daesang Award (Grand Prize) Wins:      These wins include six from the Mnet Asian Music Awards, a feat that was recorded in the 2018 Guinness World Records book. On November 3, 2017, Exo received a Prime Minister Commendation at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards, an honor bestowed in recognition of public service and/or excellence in a given field. When receiving the award, Suho said: \\"We have received such a big award alongside brilliant people ... It's such a huge honor. We will become performers who promote not only K-pop, but also Korea.\\"  Impact and influence  With the release of their debut studio album in 2013, Exo became the first South Korean artist in 12 years to sell over one million copies of an album; the previous artist to reach this milestone was g.o.d, in 2001. In 2018, Exo became \\"quintuple million sellers\\", meaning the band has sold over one million copies apiece for five different albums. Following the release of their fifth studio album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo, Exo became the first South Korean artist who debuted in the 21st century to sell 10 million albums cumulatively. Exo have also contributed significantly to the financial success of their management agency, SM Entertainment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SM Entertainment recorded the largest ever quarterly profit for any South Korean entertainment company at $13.4 million. Exo generated the highest revenue of all SM artists, at 31% of the total $188 million fourth quarter revenue. Exo have been described as \\"the biggest boy band in the world\\". They have also been labelled \\"Kings of K-Pop\\" by international outlets Vogue, Metro, PageOne and South Korean outlets such as OBS,   as well as \\"Nation's pick\\" and \\"Global pick\\" by South Korean media.  * Exo have gained immense popularity in South Korea and were named by Forbes on the Korea Power Celebrity list as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea for 2015 and 2016; within the top five for 2014, 2017, and 2018; and within the top 10 for 2019   * They are considered a prominent force in the Hallyu Wave, which refers to the rise and spread of Korean pop culture around the world. When discussing the significance of Exo in a global context, Bustle described them as \\"the ultimate K-pop sensation\\": \\"there's really nothing quite like Exo.\\" Vulture described Exo as \\"leaders of a K-pop generation\\" when describing the band's ability to consistently release music in the Korean and Chinese markets while continuing to impress in the United States with Billboard chartings and arena tours. Similarly, Dazed considered Exo's success to be that of \\"a continent- straddling pop juggernaut\\". In 2016, AsiaOne said \\"Exo are turning into an omnipresent, unstoppable global force,\\" citing their worldwide popularity, critical acclaim, and large fandom size. In April 2018, Forbes described Exo as one of the two artists worldwide (alongside fellow K-pop band BTS) that dramatically over-perform on social media, even exceeding the reach of American artists such as Beyonce, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Twitter statistics from Next Big Sound showed that Exo recorded 14,000 times more mentions than expected, with 24 million in total. In addition, Exo ranked second on the Billboard Social 50 Year-End Chart in 2018. Exo's work has influenced numerous artists, including MVP, Kim Dong-han, NCT 127, Wanna One, and Kang Daniel. Other ventures Endorsements Exo has maintained numerous endorsement deals throughout the group's career, and has been named multiple times as having the most powerful brand reputation among K-pop artists by the Korean Business Research Institute. Since 2012, Exo has maintained a partnership with Samsung, the largest public company in South Korea, where the group has endorsed the company's electronic products. In early February 2013, Exo began promoting the South Korean clothing brand Kolon Sport, for which they filmed a commercial for a new pair of sneakers named for their collaboration: MOVE-XO. Also in 2013, Exo began a two-year endorsement deal with cosmetics brand Nature Republic, which was later extended and remains active to this day. Their partnership grew in 2015 and 2016 to include autograph events, which drew 30,000 and 50,000 fans, respectively. The 2015 autograph event was held in Busan, with crowds such that the municipal police department tweeted: \\"Currently live from Exo's fan signing in Gwangbukdong. One, two three! We Are One! Busan Police! Everyone, please be in order.\\" These events were followed by the Green Nature Exo Fan Festival in 2017 and 2018; both were concert-style events hosted by Nature Republic with thousands of attendees. In late 2015, Exo officially endorsed Star Wars: The Force Awakens with the release of a collaboration film that featured \\"the nine Exo members in a Star Wars-inspired world where clubs are 'Jedi Only' and they carry lightsabers\\", according to Billboard. In 2016, the group became ambassadors for American footwear company Skechers, endorsing the D'Lites 2 Sweet Monster Collection.

The church is a Grade II* listed building and the cross in the churchyard is both a listed building and a scheduled monument. History The Book of Llandaff refers to the existence of a church, or monastery, on this site in about 735, when it was already described as an \\"old church\\" (henllan). Later charters refer to its fishing rights on the River Wye. At that time, it was dedicated to the Welsh saint Tydiwg, or Tadeocus.Sarah and John Zaluckyj, The Celtic Christian Sites of the Central and Southern Marches, Logaston Press, 2006, , p.329 The Welsh name of the parish, Llandydiwg, and ultimately the name Dixton, derives from that of the saint. Sabine Baring-Gould, The Lives of the British Saints, vol.4, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, p.288 The existing church, now substantially rendered and whitewashed, consists of a nave with a separate chancel, a vestry, a tower to the west, and north and south porches. The oldest parts of the building, including the herring-bone masonry in the north wall of the nave, may have an Anglo Saxon origin or, alternatively, date from the 12th century.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.216 The nave seems to have been lengthened during the 13th century, perhaps when the tower and chancel were built. A small window in the southwest corner dates from the early 14th century; even so, in 1397 the church was described as \\"intolerably dark\\". The exposed Old Red Sandstone walling in the chancel dates from the 14th century; the chancel has a sanctuary window on each side, a priest's door, and an ancient stone bench outside. A royal coat of arms dated 1711 is painted on a board inside the church. Interior of the church after a flood in 1910 The north porch and vestry were added in 1824, and the whole church was restored in 1861‚Äì62. Inside the church are five stained glass windows. The 1862 window on the south of the nave is titled Christ Raising the Daughter of Jairus and Healing the Son of the Widow of Nain. It was designed by John Pollard Seddon, who with John Prichard restored the church. On the same wall is an 1871 window titled The Sermon on the Mount by Ward and Hughes. The last large window is on the east wall of the chancel and is entitled Agnus Dei Adored by St Mary Magdalene and St Tadioc; it dates from 1954.

The church is too low-lying to prevent winter floods from entering the building, and brass plates near the chancel arch record the heights of notable floods. A new balcony has been constructed at the back of the church so that perishable items can be kept above the floodline. This balcony is decorated with a beautiful oak screen. The church had a rectory, which was later known as Dixton Cottage. Diocese right The church remains part of the Diocese of Hereford and the Church of England, despite being in Monmouthshire, Wales. With Monmouth, it was transferred to the Diocese of Llandaff in 1844. However, a vote by the congregation in 1915 decided that it should not join the Church in Wales when it became disestablished, but stay as part of the Church of England; it returned at that point to the Diocese of Hereford.

He was head coach at Toledo from 2011 to 2015. Prior to that, Campbell had been an assistant at Toledo, Bowling Green, and Mount Union. Campbell grew up in Ohio and briefly attended the University of Pittsburgh before transferring to Mount Union, where he played defensive line. Playing career Campbell was born in Massillon, Ohio. Rick, his father, coached football at Jackson High School. Matt played football at rival Perry, which won three conference championships while he was on the team. Campbell initially attended the University of Pittsburgh on a scholarship in 1998, but transferred to the University of Mount Union after a year. At Mount Union Campbell played on the defensive line between 1999‚Äì2002. At Mount Union Campbell played for head coach Larry Kehres, whose teams won three Division III championships during Campbell's career. Campbell himself was twice named to the College Football All-America Team and named Ohio Athletic Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year. Coaching career After college, Campbell stayed within Ohio and took a job as a graduate assistant at Bowling Green State University from 2003‚Äì2004. While at Bowling Green Scott Pioli, then the director of player personnel for the New England Patriots, offered Campbell an interview for a job at the team, but Campbell declined. Campbell returned to Mount Union for 2005‚Äì2006 as offensive coordinator; Mount Union won the Division III championship both years. Campbell then went back to Bowling Green for two years, first as offensive line coach (2007) and then as offensive line coach/run game coordinator (2008). The University of Toledo hired him as the run game coordinator for the 2009 season. This move reunited him with head coach Tim Beckman, defensive coordinator at Bowling Green during Campbell's first stint there.  Toledo  Toledo promoted Campbell to offensive coordinator in 2010. Toledo made Campbell the permanent head coach at the end of 2011 when Beckman departed for the University of Illinois. He was 32 years old and the youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Two weeks into the job, Toledo defeated Air Force in the Military Bowl. Reportedly Campbell passed on a chance to serve on Urban Meyer's staff at Ohio State University. Campbell coached four full seasons at Toledo: 2012‚Äì2015, amassing a record of 35‚Äì15.

The principle was discovered by a Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, in 1940. It attracted interest because it could help to hide ships from submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic, and the research project began early in 1941. The Royal Navy and the US Navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943. The concept behind diffused lighting camouflage was to project light on to the sides of a ship, to make its brightness match its background. Projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull and the prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see service. The Canadian ideas were adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project. Concept The firefly squid uses bioluminescence to counter-illuminate its underside to match the brighter sea surface above. Diffused lighting camouflage was explored by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and tested at sea on corvettes during World War II, and later in the armed forces of the UK and the US. Principle of counter-illumination camouflage in squid. When seen from below by a predator, the animal's light helps to match its brightness and colour to the sea surface. An equivalent strategy, known to zoologists as counter-illumination, is used by many marine organisms, notably cephalopods including the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies the intensity of the light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage by lighting out the animal's shadow. In 1940, Edmund Godfrey Burr, a Canadian professor at McGill University,R.C. Fetherstonhaugh, R.C., 1947, pages 337-341. serendipitously stumbled on the principle of counter-illumination, or as he called it \\"diffused-lighting camouflage\\".Burr, 1947, pages 45-54.Burr, 1948, pages 19-35. Burr had been tasked by Canada's National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate night observation instruments. With these, he found that aircraft flying without navigation lights remained readily visible as silhouettes against the night sky, which was never completely black. Burr wondered if he could camouflage planes by somehow reducing this difference in brightness. One night in December 1940, Burr saw a plane coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish: light reflected from the snow had illuminated the underside of the plane just enough to cancel out the difference in brightness, camouflaging the plane perfectly. Burr informed the NRC, who told the RCN. They realized that the technique could help to hide ships from German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. Before the introduction of centimetre radar, submarines with their small profile could see convoy ships before they were themselves seen. Diffused lighting camouflage might, the RCN believed, redress the balance. Prototyping Royal Canadian Navy HMCS Cobalt began the secret sea trials of diffused lighting camouflage in January 1941. Burr was quickly called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters to discuss how to apply diffused lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors‚Äîneither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed‚Äîon temporary supports on one side of the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.Sumrall, Robert F. \\"Ship Camouflage (WWII): Deceptive Art\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings. February 1973. pages 67‚Äì81 HMCS Kamloops with diffused lighting camouflage fittings on struts around the funnel, September 1941 The second version, with blue-green filters over the projectors, was trialled on board the corvette HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes by as much as 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version. The third version featured a photocell to measure the brightness of the night sky and the ship's side; the projectors' brightness was automatically controlled to balance out the difference. It was tested in September 1941 on the corvette HMCS Kamloops. Royal Navy Parallel trials of the Canadian diffused lighting equipment were carried out in March 1941 by the Royal Navy on the corvette HMS Trillium in the Clyde approaches. The Admiralty report on the Trillium trials stated that \\"Under certain weather conditions, the Canadian trials, in spite of the crude equipment used, gave highly satisfactory results. The experience gained during the present trials indicated that in various other types of weather this same equipment gave a much less conclusive indication of its value\\", and described the technical difficulties that any future version would face. The Admiralty informed the prime minister, Winston Churchill, at the end of that month, stating that the \\"results seem quite promising\\". Churchill replied the next day, suggesting that \\"Surely all this business should be pressed forward on a broader front than the one ship?\\" Accordingly, in April 1941 the Admiralty ordered further development work for \\"full scale trials\\". The British General Electric Company developed a manually operated diffused lighting system, which was trialled on the ocean boarding vessel HMS Largs and the light cruiser HMS Penelope. The Largs surface observation trials were conducted between 25 January and 6 February 1942; air observation trials, using Hudson bombers, took place on the nights of 4/5 February and 25/26 March 1942. They found an average reduction in the range at which the ship could be seen at night from another ship of around 25% using binoculars, 33% using the naked eye; the results from the air were less conclusive. The best case was on the exceptionally clear moonless night of 29/30 January 1942, when Largs could be seen from a surface ship with the naked eye at unlighted, but only with her diffused lighting, a 57% reduction. By June 1942, Royal Navy commanders considered that camouflage was largely unnecessary, given that the enemy would be using RDF and submarine hydrophones. In April 1943, the Admiralty decided that diffused lighting was impractical, and development was halted, though discussions continued with the Canadian Navy.

The US Navy sent its control system and diffused lighting fittings to Canada's NRC, which installed it on the corvettes HMCS Edmundston and HMCS Rimouski in 1943 and carried out further prototyping.Summary Technical Report of Division 16, NDRC.

Both Edmundston and Rimouski were fitted with about 60 light projectors: those on the hull were on retractable supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green. In September 1943, Rimouski, using her diffused lighting system, but also some navigation lights, approached in the Baie des Chaleurs. The intention was to make Rimouski appear as \\"a small and inoffensive ship\\" in an operation to trap the submarine, and this appears to have worked as the U-boat did not detect her. However the attack failed, as a wrong signal sent from shore alerted the submarine's commander, Kapit√§nleutnant Schauenburg; U-536 dived and escaped. Following Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic ‚Äì through long-range aircraft, radar, code decryption, and better escort tactics ‚Äì the need to camouflage ships from submarines greatly decreased, and diffused lighting research became a low priority. The work was halted when the war ended. In aircraft Yehudi counter-illumination system of automatically adjusted forward-pointing lights was trialled in B-24 Liberators from 1943 onwards. Because submarines at the surface could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found that the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics. An American version, \\"Yehudi\\", using lamps mounted in the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, was trialled in B-24 Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945. By directing the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the aircraft's skin), the system provided effective counter-illumination camouflage with an affordable use of energy, more like that of marine animals than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. But the system never entered active service, as radar became the principal means of detecting aircraft.

He also functioned as honorary curator until 1897 when a suitable director was found. Breijer taught natural science and mathematics at the Pretoria Normal College (later the University of Pretoria) and in 1905 was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Johannesburg School of Mines and Technology, which later became the Witwatersrand University. He remained there until 1913 when he succeeded Dr. J. W. B. Gunning as director of the Transvaal Museum. Breijer was often associated with the Dutch-born entomologist Cornelis Jacobus Swierstra (1874-1952) in his collecting done in South Africa and Mozambique, and was succeeded as director by him in 1921.

It was constructed in the 1740s or 1750s on a small hillside along the Saddle River (Passaic River) and is approached from Dunkerhook Road via a roadway that permits access to the park. The National Park Service Heritage Documentation Programs Historic American Buildings Survey took photographs and made architectural drawings of the house in 1938, and the National Park Service added the Naugle House to the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 1983. Since its construction, the Naugle House has been a neighbor to the Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House; Jacob Vanderbeck Sr. constructed both houses. It is typical of the Dutch Colonial architecture of the region in featuring coursed ashlar sandstone block walls, but is unique in having been built into the side of a hill, giving it two and a half stories. The lowest level was a kitchen, and its top floor is wooden frame construction. Its plan and appearance are remarkably similar to the now- demolished Zabriskie Tenant House, which sat a short distance away from the Naugle House across the Saddle River in Paramus. Its small size, unique appearance, and configuration near one of the entrances to the Saddle River County Park have made it a recognizable and beloved landmark building in Fair Lawn. The Naugle House may have a further historical link, having possibly been visited by the Marquis de Lafayette, a close associate of George Washington, in 1784. In 2010, Fair Lawn purchased the Naugle House for $1,700,000, a combination of borough funds and monies from the Bergen County and State of New Jersey Open Space and Green Acres funding programs, in order to protect the house and to create a greenspace of trees and lawns around the house in perpetuity. That purchase followed plans for the construction of town houses on the Naugle House's property. Although Fair Lawn and Bergen County held a dedication ceremony for the house in the fall of 2011, the year that the historic preservation organization Preservation New Jersey placed the house on its \\"Ten Most Endangered\\" List, the Naugle House has come under pressure of demolition or neglect by nature of development plans for the Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House that involve the construction of parking lots and driveways completely around the Naugle House, thereby endangering its structural and historic landscape integrity.

He was the son of Domenico Durante, mayor of Gallodoro (Messina) from 1880 to 1884. The education of Francesco was entrusted to Don Di Blasi; his father wanted to see him graduate in engineering but one day he went to the university of medicine in Messina with his friend, who was studying here. The teacher, amazed at his comments and at his bent, urged him to study medicine. So he started to study medicine in Messina, but he graduated in Naples in 1864. He moved to Rome in 1872 after a lot of travels around Europe. He projected and founded with Guido Baccelli the general hospital Policlinico Umberto I in Rome in 1872. Durante became Senator of the kingdom of Italy in the 16th Legislature. He was one of the first surgeons in Italy and in the world to successfully remove brain tumors. During the First World War, he gave his all and besides avoided the mutilation of thousands of soldiers. In 1908 he moved to Messina, just devastated by an earthquake, with a load of medical materials and with a group of volunteers and developed surgical pavilions. He followed Hippocrates' doctrine; doctor has to heal and soothe without profit purposes. He became president of the Order of Surgeons in Italy. In 1919 he decided to leave Rome and to return definitively to Sicily. He retired to private life in his home in Letojanni where he died on 2 October 1934. The \\"poor\\" in Letojanni, erected a monument, unveiled during a solemn ceremony in honor of Durante himself in 1923.

Often referred to as the \\"father of the health maintenance organization,\\"See, for instance, and Michael Booth, \\"The Latest from the Father of the HMO,\\" Corporate Report Minnesota, Cover Story, October 1991.In \\"New Optimism from the Father of the HMO, An Interview with Paul Ellwood Jr., MD,\\" Managed Care (November 1997), Ellwood reports he coined the term in May 1970 for the Nixon Administration. he not only coined the term, he also played a role in bringing about structural changes to the American health care system to simultaneously control cost and promote health by replacing fee-for-service with prepaid, comprehensive care. The term \\"HMO\\" was coined by Dr. Paul M. Ellwood Jr. in a January 1970 Fortune Magazine article. More recently, he has advanced an agenda for monitoring health outcomes, so that patients, providers, and payers can make health care decisions based on real information about what treatments and providers are actually effective. Ellwood began his career as a pediatric neurologist, specializing in polio at the height of the international polio epidemic in the early 1950s. The epidemic subsided with the introduction of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk. The Sister Kenny Institute, which Ellwood directed, then filled its vacant beds with children suffering from learning disabilities. According to Ellwood, one evening while doing rounds amid crying children, it struck him that they were making decisions for economic reasons (the need to fill hospital beds) that were not in the best interests of patients. His growing conviction that this calculus ‚Äì putting the interests of health care providers over patient well-being ‚Äì characterized the American medical system in general, led him to conceive of and advocate for alternative approaches. Biography Ellwood was born on July 16, 1926 in San Francisco and raised in Oakland, California. He was the son of a nurse-turned-homemaker and a dedicated physician who made house calls much of Paul's young life and served inner-city patients in Oakland into his eighties. After graduating high school, Ellwood enlisted in the Navy and served as Pharmacist Mate Third Class in the Philippines from 1944 to 1946. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1949 and a medical degree from Stanford Medical School in 1953. He worked in the Elizabeth Kenny Institute, later known as the American Rehabilitation Foundation, from 1953 to 1971, as a physician and ultimately the Executive Director. At the same time he served as Clinical Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Minnesota, where he founded the program in Pediatric Neurology. He was co- editor of the Handbook of Physical Medicine, and received the 1971 Gold Key, physical medicine's highest award. In 1973 he founded Interstudy, a health policy think tank based in Minnesota, where he served as Executive Director. He served as the founder and president of the Jackson Hole Group from 1971 to 2002. Health maintenance organizations and managed competition In 1970 Ellwood was invited to consult with President Nixon's staff to reshape national health policy, where he advanced the idea of giving consumers a choice among health plans that would compete on price and quality. He coined the term Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, to describe groups of physicians who were pre-paid on a per-patient basis (capitation) instead of a fee-for-service arrangement. While the term \\"HMO\\" was Ellwood's, this institutional model already existed in the form of the non-profit Kaiser health plan in California. Ellwood argued that creating a system of many competing HMOs would give health providers an incentive to keep patients well while driving down health care costs. Doctors would promote preventive medicine and would be less inclined to order costly procedures that had not been proven to improve health outcomes. Ellwood's work with the Nixon administration culminated in the passage of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. The result was a dramatic change to the landscape of health care in the United States: the proliferation of HMOs, Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), and Independent Provider Associations (IPAs) alongside traditional fee-for-service arrangements. In 1971, Ellwood founded the Jackson Hole Group, a \\"loosely organized but highly regarded\\" group of politicians, providers, and policymakers who came together in the town of Jackson Hole, Wyoming to discuss ideas for changing the health care incentive structure. A key member of the group was Alain Enthoven, a Stanford economist who was instrumental in shaping the concept of \\"managed competition\\" in health care. By influencing policy, as well as the decision-making of some in the health care and insurance industries, he and his colleagues would have a major impact on the changing shape of health care for decades.See for instance \\"Jackson Hole Revisited: How a Group of Health Policy Thinkers Transformed the Nation‚Äôs Healthcare System\\" Health Leaders, June 2001; Richard L. Clarke, \\"Paul M. Ellwood, MD: Reforming Health Care from Jackson Hole,\\" Healthcare Financial Management, November 1994; and Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, \\"Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival\\", American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002. Controversy over HMOs Subsequently, when the Clinton administration was grappling with health care reform, the Jackson Hole Group, according to The New York Times, was \\"one of the most important influences in the shaping of the Clinton plan.\\" The plan was called managed competition, and two of its most prominent advocates from the Jackson Hole Group were Ellwood and Alain Enthoven. In essence, the concept was that groups of health care providers and insurers would compete with each other to get the business of large cooperatives seeking insurance. In the end the Clinton reform plan collapsed. By then, the Jackson Hole Group had distanced itself due to disagreement about the degree of regulation the plan sought to impose, and Ellwood had become a pioneer in outcomes management.See Emling. Also Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, \\"Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival\\", American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002. For Ellwood‚Äôs critique of the Clinton plan, see Paul M. Ellwood, \\"Balance the Health Budget,\\" The New York Times editorial, December 6, 1993, p. 10. The spread of HMOs and other pre-paid health plans has spawned significant debate about the impact on quality of care. From the beginning, critics argued that pre-paid competitive plans like HMOs provided incentives for doctors and hospitals to \\"skimp\\" on care.\\"Health Care: the Cost Crisis is Over ‚Äì But What about Quality?\\" Business Week, October 21, 1985. Many have complained that the plans restrict providers‚Äô autonomy and patients‚Äô choice of doctors. On the left, advocates of a Canadian style government health plan have argued that the Managed Competition approach enriches the insurance industry at patient and taxpayer expense and relies naively on free market forces.Erik Eckholm, \\"On ‚ÄòManaged Competition‚Äô: Primer on Health-Care Idea,\\" The New York Times, May 1, 1993, provides a discussion over managed competition, including critiques from both the left and right. Many proponents of the managed competition approach, including Ellwood, argue that regulations built into the legislation have undermined the market competition that was meant to enable patients and providers to choose among plans based on quality and cost. Ellwood has repeatedly expressed disappointment with the way his concepts played out. \\"What went wrong?\\" he reflected in 2011. \\"Political expediency in the initial plan designed to promote HMO growth led to the inclusion of three mistakes: for-profit plans, independent practice associations, and the failure to include outcome accountability.\\"American Hospital Association interview, p. 16. Ellwood was particularly adamant about the last. Without measures of health outcomes, which he had advocated from the beginning, there was no way to really know how the changes in health care organization were affecting patients. More important, there was no way to ensure that patients and providers were making good decisions. And there was no way to hold health providers accountable, to ensure that they were not reducing costs in ways that hurt patients.For a discussion of the debates over HMOs and the evolution of Ellwood‚Äôs thinking, see Lisa Belkin, \\"But What About Quality?\\" The New York Times Magazine, December 8, 1996. Outcomes management Ellwood's concern about the importance of measuring health outcomes that would hold health providers accountable for quality dated to the mid-1960s. In 1968, as an adviser to the Johnson administration, he devised the plans for the establishment of U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). He would become increasingly vocal about the need for evidence-based medicine and outcomes accountability. In 1988, he was invited by the Massachusetts Medical Society, which publishes the New England Journal of Medicine, to deliver their annual Shattuck Lecture. He called for \\"a national database containing information and analysis on clinical, financial, and health outcomes that estimate as best we can the relation between medical interventions and health outcomes, as well as the relation between health outcomes and money.\\" He envisioned a sort of health plan \\"report card\\" that would allow patients to make informed choices among health plans based on health outcomes for specific conditions and patients‚Äô reports of their satisfaction. He argues that there is extraordinary variation in the quality-performance of different doctors and health institutions, yet patients, insurers, policymakers, and even other doctors have few tools for assessing quality. Similarly, doctors and patients often choose medical interventions with only limited information about the effectiveness of various treatments and how they impact patients‚Äô quality of life; a health outcomes database would vastly improve the information available when making such decisions. Finally, a health outcomes database would guide policymakers and large providers in the overall design of health systems. The Mayo Clinic and some health providers have begun to experiment with outcomes management. Family Ellwood and his former wife, Elizabeth Ann Schwenk, have three children: Deborah Ellwood, who directs a national consortium of community foundations; Cynthia Ellwood, a regional superintendent in the Milwaukee school system; and David Ellwood, Dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard. On December 8, 1996, The New York Times Magazine ran back-to-back stories about Paul Ellwood and David Ellwood under the cover banner, \\"What Have the Ellwoods Done to America?\\" ‚Äì a reference to Paul Ellwood's role in reshaping American health care and his son's role in reshaping the American welfare system.The cover subheading read, \\"The visionary father transformed the American way of health.

Veterinary medicine is normally led by veterinary physicians, normally termed veterinarians or vets. Veterinarians are often assisted by paraveterinary workers including veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants, and in some cases, these para-professionals may perform work on their own. Dependent on the jurisdiction, other professionals may be permitted to perform some animal treatment, through either specific exemptions in the law or through a lack of prohibitive legislation. This can include manipulation techniques such as physiotherapy, chiropractic and osteopathy, or animal-specific professions such as horse and cattle hoof trimmers, equine dental technicians, and technicians who specialize in cattle artificial insemination. Veterinarians Veterinarian's Oath The Veterinarian's Oath was adopted by the American Veterinary Medical Association's House of Delegates July 1969, and amended by the AVMA Executive Board, November 1999 and December 2010. Qualification In order to practice, veterinarians must obtain a degree in veterinary medicine, followed by gaining a license to practice. Previously, veterinary degrees were available as a bachelor's degree, but now all courses result in the award of a doctorate and are therefore awarded a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) at most veterinary schools in the United States of America, or a Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris (\\"Doctor of Veterinary Medicine\\") (VMD) if the degree is earned at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. There is a high level of competition for admission to veterinary schools; there are currently only thirty veterinary schools in the United States which meet the accreditation standards set by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and five in Canada. Entrance requirements vary among veterinary schools, and various pre-professional degree programs have been developed to assist undergraduates in meeting these requirements. Such ‚Äúpre-vet‚Äù programs are thus similar in concept to ‚Äúpre-med‚Äù programs, and are often housed in Agricultural Biology,http://eppws.nmsu.edu/pre-professional-program Agricultural Biology pre-professional option at the New Mexico State University. Animal Science,http://ansci.illinois.edu/content/science-pre-veterinary-and-medical Animal Science pre-vet option at the University of Illinois. or Biological Science Biology pre-vet/pre-med option at Purdue University. programs. Following qualification from the doctoral degree, the prospective veterinarian must receive a passing grade on the North America Veterinary Licensing Exam. This exam is completed over the course of eight hours, and consists of 360 multiple-choice questions. This exam covers all aspects of veterinary medicine, as well as visual material designed to test diagnostic skills.  Salary  The median salary for starting veterinarians in 2018 was $104,690 in the United States according to U.S. Money News, while the lowest paid graduates earned approximately $87,000 annually. Montana had the lowest state average, while Michigan, Illinois and Hawaii had the highest. The average income for private practice associates in the United States was $191,000 in 2017. According to DVM360 most practice owners paid themselves based on production, including a 3-4% management fee plus a 4.5% \\"return on investment\\" fee dependent on the value of their business. We know from industry standards that the average owner of a veterinary practice earned approximately $382,000 per year base salary in 2017. These increased values exceed those of public practice including uniformed services and government. In Australia, the profession wide average income was $167,000 in 2015 and this has declined compared to other professions for the past 30 years whilst graduate unemployment has doubled between 2006 and 2015. Veterinary specialties As opposed to human medicine, general practice veterinarians greatly outnumber veterinary specialists. Most veterinary specialists work at the veterinary schools, or at a referral center in large cities. As opposed to human medicine, where each organ system has its own medical and surgical specialties, veterinarians often combine both the surgical and medical aspect of an organ system into one field. The specialties in veterinary medicine often encompass several medical and surgical specialties that are found in human medicine. Veterinary specialties are accredited in North America by the AVMA through the American Board of Veterinary Specialties. While some veterinarians may have areas of interest outside of recognized specialties, they are not legally specialists. According to a veterinary survey top paying specialties include veterinary anesthesiology ($389,105 median salary in 2008), veterinary ophthalmology ($215,120 median salary in 2009), veterinary nutrition ($202,368 average salary in 2008), and veterinary general surgery ($183,902 average salary in 2008). Veterinary technicians Veterinary technician logo Veterinary technicians are the primary paraveterinary workers in the US and assist the veterinarian in the role of a nurse (and in most other anglophone countries, the equivalent role is called a veterinary nurse), providing trained support. The requirements for technicians vary by state, but in most cases, technicians are graduates of two or four year college-level programs and are legally qualified to assist veterinarians in many medical procedures. Some states choose to license technicians, so that only people with appropriate qualifications are able to fulfill the role, but this is not the case in all jurisdictions. History Veterinary technology as an organized and credentialed career option is relatively young, only existing since the mid 20th century, although it began in 1908 when the Canine Nurses Institute was established in England, and as such is still struggling for recognition in many parts of the world. The first training program for technicians in the United States was established by the Air Force in 1951. The first civilian program was established ten years later in 1961 at the State University of New York (SUNY) Agricultural and Technical College at Delhi. In 1965 Walter Collins, a veterinarian, received federal funding to develop model curricula for training technicians. He produced several guides over the next seven years, and for this work he is considered the \\"father of veterinary technology\\" in the United States. Role and duties Technical skills include: venipuncture; collecting urine; performing skin scrapings; taking and processing radiographs; and performing routine lab procedures and tests in: hematology, blood chemistry, microbiology, urinalysis, and microscopy. They assist the veterinarian with physical examinations that help determine the nature of the illness or injury. Veterinary technicians also induce and maintain anesthesia, and administer medications, fluids and blood products as prescribed by the veterinarian. Tasks in patient care include: recording temperature, pulse and respiration, dressing wounds, applying splints and other protective devices, and dental procedures. They perform catheterizations ‚Äì urinary, arterial, and venous; ear flushes; intravenous feedings and tube feedings. Equipment use includes operating various types of patient monitors and imaging devices to include electrocardiographic, radiographic and ultrasonographic equipment. Larger referral practices and teaching hospitals may also find veterinary technicians operating computed tomography equipment, magnetic resonance imagers, gamma cameras and other advanced medical devices. Veterinary technicians commonly assist veterinarians in surgery by providing correct equipment and instruments and by assuring that monitoring and support equipment are in good working condition. They may also maintain treatment records and inventory of all pharmaceuticals, equipment and supplies, and help with other administrative tasks within a veterinary practice such as client education. Unlike their more specialized counterparts among medical paraprofessionals, the veterinary technician is usually the only paraprofessional found in a veterinary practice and is thus often called upon to be a jack-of-all-trades. Education and credentialing To become a credentialed veterinary technician, one must complete a two- or three-year AVMA credentialed degree, most of which result in the awarding of an Associate of Applied Science in Veterinary Technology degree. Those completing a four- year AVMA accredited school gain a bachelor's degree and are considered veterinary technologists, though the distinction is rarely made, with the term \\"technician\\" being used generally. The education a credentialed technician receives is in-depth and crucial for medical understanding and to give proper health care. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) is responsible for accrediting schools with either associate's degrees or bachelor's degrees, though in some states or provinces this is not necessary. The AVMA also accredits schools that offer distance education. As a requirement of AVMA accreditation, all distance learning programs require a significant amount of practical clinical experience before the student will be allowed to graduate. Specialty certification Beyond credentialing as a veterinary technician specialty certification is also available to technicians with advanced skills. To date there are specialty recognitions in: emergency & critical care, anesthesiology, dentistry, small animal internal medicine, large animal internal medicine, cardiology, oncology, neurology, zoological medicine, equine veterinary nursing, surgery, behavior, nutrition, clinical practice (canine/feline, exotic companion animal, and production animal sub- specialties), and clinical pathology. Veterinary Technician Specialists carry the additional post-nominal letters \\"VTS\\" with their particular specialties indicated in parentheses. As veterinary technology evolves, more specialty academy recognitions are anticipated. Veterinary assistants Non- credentialed personnel who perform similar tasks to veterinary technicians are usually referred to as veterinary assistants, though the term technician is often applied generously. In many states, a veterinary assistant cannot legally perform as many procedures as a technician. Veterinary assistants often have no formal education related to veterinary medicine or veterinary technology; however, NAVTA recently approved the designation of Approved Veterinary Assistant (AVA) for those successfully completing approved educational programs. In larger facilities with tiered hierarchies, veterinary assistants typically assist veterinary technicians in their duties.  Veterinary malpractice  Most states in the US allow for malpractice lawsuit in case of death or injury to an animal from professional negligence. Usually the penalty is not greater than the value of the animal. For that reason, malpractice insurance for veterinarians usually is well under $500 a year, compared to an average of over $15000 a year for a human doctor. Some states allow for punitive penalty, loss of companionship, and suffering into the award, likely increasing the cost of veterinary malpractice insurance and the cost of veterinary care. Most veterinarians carry much higher cost business insurance, worker's compensation, and facility insurance to protect their clients and workers from injuries inflicted by animals.

In a career that lasted from October 1831 to July 1835 he ran eleven times and won five races. After showing little form as a two-year-old, he made marked improvement to win his first three races of 1832, culminating with a highly- controversial success in The Derby. His only subsequent wins came in two minor races in 1835 and he was eventually sold and exported to stand as a stallion in the United States. Background St. Giles was a dark chestnut horse bred by Mr Cattle, a farmer from Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire. He was bought from his breeder by Robert Ridsdale, a professional gambler with a reputation for dishonesty and corruption. Ridsdale owned the colt in partnership with John Gully, a former champion prize-fighter and gambler who went on to become a Member of Parliament. St. Giles was sired by Tramp, who won several important races in 1813 and 1814 and went on to become a very successful stallion, siring important winners including Dangerous (Epsom Derby) and Barefoot (St Leger). St. Giles's dam, Arcot Lass was one of the few mares to produce two Derby winners, being also the dam of Bloomsbury. Racing career 1831: two-year-old season St. Giles was unnamed and ran as \\"Mr. Ridsdale's ch. c. by Tramp out of Arcot Lass\\" when he made his debut in the Two-Year-Old Plate at Newmarket in October 1831. He started favourite at odds of 5/2 but finished unplaced behind the filly Miss Mary Anne. At the end of the month he returned to Newmarket for the Nursery Stakes, a handicap race over one mile in which he carried 104 pounds. Running for the first time as \\"St. Giles\\" he finished fourth of the six runners behind a colt named Gratis. 1832: three-year-old season Spring St. Giles showed much improved form in the spring of 1832. In April he defeated the year older filly Lioness by a head in a ¬£100 match race over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. He carried 112 pounds to the filly's 130, giving him advantage of approximately eight pounds in modern, weight-for-age terms. Three days later he appeared in a handicap race in which he carried top weight of 115 pounds and won \\"cleverly\\" from an unnamed grey filly by Middleton. In these races was described as being a \\"two-year-old\\", as racehorses at this time had their official \\"birthdays\\" on 1 May. From this point on St. Giles began to appear in the betting lists for the Derby. Shortly afterwards Gully purchased one of the Derby favourites Margrave for 2,500 guineas, and St. Giles became the subject of sustained support in the betting, leading to speculation that Gully and Ridsdale intended to manage the result of the race. The Derby At Epsom on 7 June, St. Giles, despite his modest public form, started the 3/1 favourite for the Derby in a field of twenty-two runners. In a series of private trial races, he had proved himself superior to Margrave and Ridsdale's horse Trustee, and both his owners had backed him very heavily. After several false starts, the race got under way with Trustee setting a very strong pace and St. Giles, ridden by Bill Scott, settled in third. By half way, many of the runners were struggling but St. Giles was still going well and turned into the straight in second place. Just over two furlongs from the finish, Scott sent St. Giles past Trustee and into the lead. Although Perion moved strongly into second place, St. Giles was never seriously challenged and won comfortably by two lengths. Trustee held on for third and Gully's Margrave finished fourth. Although the winner was trained at Newmarket, his owner and rider were Yorkshiremen and the race was seen as a victory for the North. Ridsdale, Gully and the bookmaker William Crockford were reported to have taken a combined total of almost ¬£100,000 with Ridsdale alone winning ¬£40,000 in addition to the ¬£2,775 prize money. Controversies The victory of St. Giles was controversial in several ways. His stable companion, Margrave did not appear to have been given a hard race, and both Quarterly Review and the Sporting Review expressed the opinion that he had been held back from winning on Gully's instructions. It was also widely believed that many of the runners had been \\"made safe\\", meaning that their jockeys or trainers had been bribed to ensure they did not win. Immediately after the race, the owners of Perion lodged an official objection to the winner, on the grounds that the details of his dam's pedigree had been incorrectly described on his race entry. They went so far as to have posters printed and displayed with the words \\"ST GILES NOT ENTITLED TO DERBY STAKES!\\". Three senior members of the Jockey Club were called on to adjudicate and found in favour of Ridsdale. The issue, had in fact, been known for some time, and St Giles' eligibility for the race had been in doubt since his wins at Newmarket. It seems that the Jockey Club took the view that the matter was a minor technicality, and that there had been no intent to deceive. As with other Derby winners of this period such as M√ºndig (1835), Bloomsbury (1839) and Little Wonder (1840), there appear to have been rumours that St. Giles was actually a four-year-old at the time of his Derby win. After Epsom On his only other start of the season, St. Giles started 5/2 second favourite in a highly anticipated race for the Goodwood Cup in late July. He looked to be traveling well but weakened in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind the 1830 Derby winner Priam. St. Giles had not been entered for the St Leger and a proposed match race at Doncaster against Lord Kelburne's horse Retainer did not take place. His defeat at Goodwood therefore, proved to be his last race for two years. The partnership between Ridsdale and Gully quickly broke down following a disagreement over money and their relationship ended in a physical altercation at a hunt in November. Gully was eventually prosecuted and obliged to pay damages of ¬£500 for assaulting his former \\"friend\\". Ridsdale, despite his massive gambling wins, became insolvent and was forced to sell all his property in 1836. 1834: five-year-old season St. Giles, by now trained by John Barham Day at Danebury, finally reappeared in the Goodwood Cup of 1834 for which he started at odds of 12/1. He finished fourth of the ten runners in a strong field behind Glencoe. On his only other start of the year, St Giles ran in a race at Plymouth, which was to be decided in the old-fashioned way, with the winner being the first to win two heats. St. Giles sustained a bruised foot in the first heat and was withdrawn. 1835: six-year-old season In either 1834 or early 1835, St. Giles was sold to Thomas Kirkby of York and moved to the stable of John Scott at Malton, North Yorkshire. On April 22, 1835, St. Giles recorded his first win for almost three years by beating seven opponents in the eleven furlong Craven Stakes at Catterick. A month later at York Racecourse he started at odds of 1/3 and claimed the one and three quarter mile Stand Purse by winning the first two heats. In his final race, St. Giles ran in his third Goodwood Cup. On this occasion he started at 5/1 and was among the leaders throughout the race before finishing third to Rockingham and Glaucus. Stud career St. Giles was sold to James Jackson of Alabama in 1835 and exported to the United States in September of that year. In 1836, Jackson leased St. Giles to Colonel George Elliott of Tennessee who offered the stallion's services at a fee of $60. He did not stand for the 1837 season because he was \\"out of condition.\\" While at Elliott's farm for the season of 1837-1838, the normally docile St. Giles developed the habit of biting himself and tearing his own flesh after covering mares. To counteract this problem, sharp prongs were lashed to his sides to prevent him turning his head too far to the side. St. Giles made little impact as a sire and died before 1840.

Members included scientists and professors but also educated laymen interested in the subjects as an avocation. The society was involved in the organization of natural science expeditions, exhibitions of finds from these various missions, public science education, and promoting of funding for science in the Russian Empire and later in the USSR. History The society was founded at Moscow University in 1863 under the name \\"Society of Natural Scientists\\". A department of anthropology was added in 1864 at the initiative of Anatoli Petrovich Bogdanov, Professor of Zoology and Anthropology at Moscow University, and other departments were added in subsequent years. The society's first President was Gregory Ephimovich Shchurovsky and he together with other leading members of the society discussed having a museum. Their first move in this direction was to establish a library this held books documenting the history of science and technology. This became the central polytechnic library but this established their ambitions. In 1871 Moscow council set aside half a million roubles to create a museum. A committee was formed with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich as honorary chair. The formation of a museum was timely as Peter the Great's 200th anniversary would inspire an exhibition that would be used to launch the new Polytechnic Museum.The Polytechnical Museum opened in Moscow, Presidential Library, Retrieved 17 November 2015 An expedition to Turkestan 1872 All-Russian Technical Exhibition (by Ivan Grigoryevich Dyagovchenko) which was organised by this society and which created the Polytechnic Museum In 1868 Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko was recommended by the society to undertake a hazardous mission to recently conquered region of Russian Turkestan. His wife Olga Fedchenko was a full, but unpaid, member of the team. The mission was hazardous because Turkestan was still transitioning to becoming part of the Russian Empire. Fedchenko had been recommended to the first Governor-General Konstantin von Kaufman. Kaufman wanted an investigation of what he saw as a \\"newly and scarcely explored region\\". Kaufman set up a Tashkent outpost of this society. The Fenchenkos made three separate explorations between 1868 and 1872. Kaufman was targeting the 1872 Moscow All-Russian Technical Exhibition as an opportunity to display their research. Alexei died in 1873 in a climbing accident on Mont Blanc Olga buried her husband at Chamonix and at the request of the society continued to publish their work. In 1871 the society changed its name to \\"Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography\\" The society published various journals including Proceedings of the Society of Natural History, Anthropology and Ethnography (1863‚Äì1917), Ethnographic Review (1889‚Äì1917), Geography (1894‚Äì1924), and Russian Journal of Anthropology (1900‚Äì1916). The society took the lead in establishing the Polytechnical Museum in Moscow, opened on December 12, 1872. Society members won numerous awards and medals for their work, For its contributions to Russian science the society was permitted to style itself \\"Imperial Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography\\". In 1931 the society was merged into the Moscow Society of Natural Scientists. Presidents of the society *G. E.

From 1936 onwards, Freeth exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Royal Watercolour Society and elsewhere. During World War Two, Freeth served in the Middle East as an official war artist to the Royal Air Force. The War Artists' Advisory Committee commissioned two lithographs from Freeth. During the War, he also worked on the Recording Britain project. Freeth was one of the first artists to make the people of the Black Country the main subject of his work, as other artists placed greater emphasis on representing the industrial landscape. Freeth won the prestigious Prix de Rome in engraving in 1936 and 1937, for his series of Black Country images. After the war, the National Coal Board commissioned Freeth to produce works about mine-workers due to the success of his representation of the people of the Black Country. Freeth was elected to the Royal Academy in 1965 and taught at St Martin's School of Art and the Central School of Art in London. Freeth's work is held in a number of public collections, including Birmingham Museums Trust, National Football Museum, Royal Academy of Arts and a number of university collections.

The program's most recent date was April 28, 2018.https://takebackday.dea.gov/ This program is coordinated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Drug Take Back Programs are a common and environmentally supportive venue for avoiding the improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals. In 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enough pharmaceuticals were prescribed to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month. Some of these prescriptions and over the counter drugs decay in the home and are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that the majority of teens who abuse prescription drugs obtain them from family or friends for free, including from the home medicine cabinet. Improper disposal methods can pose both safety and environmental hazards. Four days following the DEA‚Äôs first Take-Back Day on September 25, 2010, Congress approved legislation that amended the Controlled Substances Act. This action provided the DEA with the option to develop a permanent process for people to safely and conveniently dispose of their prescription drugs. After October 12, President Obama signed the Safe and Secure Drug Disposal Act of 2010, and the DEA immediately began installing regulations for a more permanent solution. The DEA‚Äôs Take-Back events are also a reflection of the President's prescription drug abuse prevention strategy entitled \\"Epidemic: Responding to America‚Äôs Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis\\" developed and promoted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Ridding medicine cabinets of unused or expired medications in American homes is one of the four main items addressed the strategy for reducing diversion prescription drug abuse. The other action items include educating the public as well as health care providers. In turn, this system establishes prescription drug monitoring programs in all the states.

Geordey, hinny\\" is a famous Geordie comic song written in the 19th century by Joe Wilson, in a style deriving from music hall. Though the words were by Wilson, it is to be sung to the existing tune of \\"Nelly Gray\\" (also used for the Liverpool song \\"Maggie May\\") Topic At the time, many working men, particularly in the building and civil engineering trades, worked away from home. These were the labourers and navvies who built the railways and canals. They arranged for \\"digs\\" wherever the work was, and in most cases, because of the costs and savings available, they slept two or more to a bed. This song features two such Geordies who share a bed in a lodging house. One, Bob Johnson, is very unhappy with his mate Geordie for waking him up when in the middle of a dream about an elusive young maiden from back home, of whom he has high hopes. His dreams are disrupted at the end of each verse by the fidgeting ‚ÄúGeordie‚Äù.  Lyrics  Joe Wilson was probably the most prolific of the Geordie songwriters of the time. Many of his works were published in his book of Songs and Drolleries. This version is as follows: KEEP YOUR FEET STILL, GEORDIE HINNY Air (or Teun) ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Darling Nellie Grey‚Äù Wor Geordey an' Bob Jonsin byeth lay i' one bed, Iv a little lodgjin hoose that's doon the shore, Before Bob had been an' oor asleep, a kick frae Geordey's fut Myed him wakin up to roar instead o' snore.

It originates from the historical Slavic religious beliefs of the early Slavs that settled in Macedonia. The works of these myths are influenced by Greco-Roman mythology. Mythic creatures Narechnici - (Macedonian: –ù–∞—Ä–µ—á–Ω–∏—Ü–∏) are demonic creatures thought to have the power to predict the destiny of a new-born baby. Usually presented as three women, Narechnici arrive on the third night following the birth of a child. Narechnici are sometimes presented as three sisters; two evil ones and one good one. The youngest sister undoes the evil curses of the two older evil sisters. Samovili - (Macedonian: –°–∞–º–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏ ; English: Fairies ) are presented as pretty girls with golden hair and wings who live in the mountains near the water. Samovili were said to have been born from the dew of flowers; either at times when it rained while the sun was shining or under a rainbow. They serve those who steal their clothes. If their wings are removed, they transform into real women. Zmey - (Macedonian: –ó–º–µ—ò) are creatures with human features that have the tail of a snake, golden wings and tremendous physical strength. Zmey live either in caves or mountain tops, and are extremely intelligent. Zmey are attracted to female beauty and capture young women and take them to their remote lairs. Lamia - (Macedonian: –õ–∞–º—ò–∞) is a large creature born from a snake's head stored in the horn of a buffalo. \\"The big Lamia has a god's head with big sharp teeth, four legs with big sharp nails and a tail, and the body is covered with fish scales.\\" Lamia usually live in caves and guard secret treasures. Stia - (Macedonian: –°—Ç–∏—ò–∞) are female creatures with long hair and fish-like tails, much like a mermaid. Stia live in the depths of lakes. Vampiri - (Macedonian: –í–∞–º–ø–∏—Ä–∏ ; English: Vampires ) Macedonia hosted several types of vampires: the vampire-husband or sexual partner comes back to life to impregnate his wife if she had not conceived while he was alive. The vampire- housekeeper returns to help his family through additional cattle or money. There is an evil vampire that damages land and cattle. Vampires-butchers frequently work in a local butchery; vampire-animals transform from a dead man/vampire into an animal, often a dog or similar creature. Other mythological creatures are Talasami - (Macedonian: –¢–∞–ª–∞—Å–∞–º–∏), Giants - (Macedonian: –è–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏), Dwarves - (Macedonian: –è—É—ü–∏—ö–∞), Chuma - (Macedonian: –ß—É–º–∞), Ala - (Macedonian: –ê–ª–∞) and Vrag - (Macedonian: –í—Ä–∞–≥).

Following the war he served in Dutch East Indies, before returning to Europe to work behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe for the United States, which served as an inspiration for Ian Fleming's James Bond series. Resistance In September 1938 he trained to be a midshipman at the Royal Netherlands Naval College. In 1939 he moved to Groningen where he enrolled in the . When war broke out on 10 May 1940, Tazelaar was working for the Dutch Merchant Navy. He tried to escape to England by way of Zeeland and northern France, but he failed to reach England. After returning to Groningen in late May 1940, he came into contact with Midshipman John Birnie. During summer 1940, Birnie had joined a group of cadets and midshipmen that had formed a resistance group called the Ordedienst. Birnie introduced his new friend to the Ordedienst which was based in The Hague and headed by Dutch nobleman , who went by the code name of \\"Uncle Alexander\\". Mission to England Since the resistance had no direct contact with England, Tazelaar was chosen to go to England to make contact with British intelligence forces. In early June 1941 he mustered as a stoker on the Panamanian-flagged, Swiss freighter St-Cergue. The ship was in the port of Schiedam and was voyaging to New York to pick up a supply of corn for the Germans. Two students from Leiden, Bram van der Stok and Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, also escaped to England with Tazelaar. In the Faroe Islands they transferred to a British cruiser and were able to reach England. Contact Holland At first it was difficult to get into contact with occupied Holland. At one point Tazelaar and his friends communicated with Queen Wilhelmina and her son-in-law Prince Bernhard. They were able to live in the apartment at the home of Wilhelmina in England. Van der Stok had devised a plan to pick up people in the occupied Netherlands by boat. After arriving in England, Hazelhoff Roelfzema worked out this plan and was instructed by Queen Wilhelmina and the British secret service to execute the plan under the name . The first officer who was put ashore by boat was Peter Tazelaar. On 23 November 1941, he dressed in a tuxedo in Scheveningen in preparation for landing. He pretended to be a drunk reveller and was able to slip past German sentries guarding the beach by the casino. Together with the parachute which had been previously dropped by radio operator Johannes ter Laak, he would establish radio contact with England. Little progress was achieved, however, because the radio was damaged during the drop. Tazelaar's second assignment was the transportation of two important people to England. Again, this did not work, because they proved too difficult to pick up in a boat. Various arrests made it too dangerous for Tazelaar to stay in the Netherlands. At the end of January 1942 he left with midshipman Gerard Dogger via the to Switzerland. Travelling via France, Spain and Portugal, they arrived in England in April 1942. Military William Order After returning to England, Tazelaar was given a training command in Wales. In February 1943 he moved to Canada to be an instructor for the Dutch troops. At the end of 1943 he returned to England. He joined the National Fire Service and married an English woman . On 9 September 1944, Tazelaar received the Dutch highest military award, the Military William Order, for his role in Contact Holland. Then he joined the BBO. BBO agents parachuted into occupied Netherlands on sabotage and espionage missions. In November 1944, Tazelaar and Lykele Faber parachuted into Friesland. They provided radio contact with England for six months. Peter Tazelaar (light coat) and Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (opposite him) as adjuncts to Queen Wilhelmina on her return to the continent, 2 May 1945 Aide to Queen Wilhelmina In April 1945 Tazelaar was appointed adjutant to Queen Wilhelmina. He accompanied her on her return to the Netherlands. A film shot at the time shows him arriving at Gilze-Rijen Air Base with Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema. For the next six weeks he assisted the queen while residing with her, her daughter Princess Juliana, and two other adjuncts in her temporary quarters at Anneville near Breda. At the time the country north of the rivers was still controlled by the Germans, and it was this portion of the country that had suffered through the Hunger Winter of 1944-45. It was Tazelaar who informed Wilhelmina of the German surrender. Asia In August 1945 Tazelaar transferred to Ceylon to participate in the fight against Japan. He served in the same unit as Raymond Westerling. Tazelaar went independently to the Dutch East Indies. His mother lived there in a Japanese internment camp for women and children, Tjideng, in Java. Tazelaar joined the military police and was involved in the detection and interrogation of Indonesian freedom fighters. In March 1946 he was wounded and returned to the Netherlands. That year he married for the second time. Later life Memorial for Peter Tazelaar in Hindeloopen (2014) Tazelaar led an adventurous life after the war KLM and Shell. In total, he married four times. He became known to the Dutch public after the release of the book Soldier of Orange and the subsequent 1977 film Soldier of Orange. Tazelaar died on 6 June 1993 at Hindeloopen.

The practice of equine dentistry varies widely by jurisdiction, with procedures being performed by veterinary physicians (both in general and specialist practice), specialist professionals termed equine dental technicians or equine dentists, and by amateurs, such as horse owners, with varying levels of training. In some jurisdictions, the practice of equine dentistry, or specific elements of equine dentistry, may be restricted only to specialists with specified qualifications or experience, whereas in others it is not controlled. History Equine dentistry was practiced as long ago as 600 BCE in China, and has long been important as a method of assessing the age of a horse. This was also practiced in ancient Greece, with many scholars making notes about equine dentistry, including Aristotle with an account of periodontal disease in horses in his History of Animals, and in Rome with Vegetius writing about equine dentistry in his manuscript \\"The Veterinary Art\\". In later years, the importance of dentition in assessing the age of horses led to veterinary dentistry being used a method of fraud, with owners and traders altering the teeth of horses to mimic the tooth shapes and characteristics of horses younger than the actual age of the equine. The first veterinary dental school was founded in Lyon, France in 1762 and created additional knowledge about dentistry in horses and other animals. Equine dental technicians Equine dental technicians (also known colloquially as equine dentists, although this is not reflective of their official title) are veterinary paraprofessionals who specialize in routine dental work on horses, especially procedures such as rasping the sharp edges of teeth, also known as 'floating'. Scope of practice may be dictated by statute. For instance, in the United Kingdom, any person, without any qualification may examine and rasp horses' healthy teeth with manual tools, remove deciduous caps (baby teeth) or remove supragingival calculus, whereas only qualified equine dental technicians or vets may remove teeth, rasp fractured teeth and use motorized dental instruments. Relationship between vets and lay practitioners There has been a long history of animosity between fully qualified vets and those lay people performing equine dentistry. This has led in some cases to an increase in voluntary and regulatory schemes in the sector. In the UK in the early 1990s, the veterinary profession engaged with lay practitioners to establish a formal system of examination and a register of qualified professionals. Whilst not compulsory, qualified persons were given an extended scope of practice for procedures normally reserved to vets. In the United States, lay practitioners have been subject to legal action to gain injunctions against their practice, with case law in states including Missouri effectively precluding the practice of equine dentistry by persons other than vets.

He was Duke of Opava from 1433 to 1452 and Duke of M√ºnsterberg from 1443 to 1452.  Life  His parents were Przemko I, Duke of Opava (d. 1433) and his second wife, Catherine of M√ºnsterberg (d. 1422). His father died in 1433, leaving five sons. The oldest brother, Wenceslaus II took up the guardianship for his younger half-brothers William, Ernest and Przemko II, while Wenceslaus's younger brother Nicholas IV styled himself Lord of Zlat√© Hory. Although their father had stipulated in his will that they should rule the ducht jointly, the brothers divided their inheritance around 1435. William and Ernest received shares of Opava; the Duchy of G≈Çubczyce was split off for Wenceslas.According to :cs:V√°clav II. Opavsk√Ω, the split was made around 1420, hence before their father's death The youngest brother, Przemko II, was destined for an ecclesiastical career and did not receive a share of the duchy. The duchy was now so fragmented that the revenue did not cover the Duke's cost of living. William saw no option but to become a robber baron. Hynek Kru≈°ina of Lichtenburg acquired the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg in 1440. The Estates, however, rejected him as their sovereign. After length negotiations, they elected William of Opava as their new Duke. William's claim to M√ºnsterberg was based on two relationships: hiw mother had been the sister of John I, the last Duke of M√ºnsterberg from the Piast dynasty, and he was married to Salome, a daughter of P≈Øta III of ƒåastolovice, who had been the lawful pledge lord of M√ºnsterberg until he died in 1434. William accepted his election and changed from a robber baron into a defender of the peace. Together with Dukes NIcholas V (d. 1452) of Krnov, Przemyslaus II of Cieszyn and Henry IX of ≈ªaga≈Ñ-G≈Çog√≥w he fought as captain of Wroc≈Çaw against highway robbers and robber barons. In 1443, he formed an alliance with Archbishop Conrad of Wroc≈Çaw and the Dukes of Wroc≈Çaw, Jawor and Legnica against Hynek Kru≈°ina of Lichtenburg. Although Hynek had never given up his claims on M√ºnsterberg, the dispute was resolved in 1444 and the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg was granted to William, except the district of ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie. The citizens of that district had fought on Hynek's side during the conflict and Hynek was allowed to retain the district. In 1451, William transferred his ownership of M√ºnsterberg to his brother Ernest, in exchange for a 1/3 share in the ownership of the Duchy of Opava. Since William had received another 1/3 share when his father's inheritance had been divided in 1435, he now owned 2/3 of Opava.Pavel Sedl√°ƒçek: Vztahy mezi Kladskem a Franken≈°teijnskem ve 14. a 15. stoleti, in: Kladsk√Ω Sborn√≠k vol. 2, 1998, p. 119 William died in 1452. His brother Ernest took up the guardianship of William's children. As their guardian, he sold William's 2/3 share of Opava to Duke Bolko V of Opole, in or after 1454. On 8 March 1456, Ernest sold the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg to George of Podƒõbrady, who would be elected King of Bohemia in 1458. George purchased the 1/3 share of Opava after Bolko's death from the latter's brother Nicholas I and in 1464, he purchased the other 2/3 in Opole in 1464 from John II, thereby considerable increasing his political and economic influence in Silesia. William of Troppau died in 1452. He was buried in the Holy Spirit Church in Opava.

Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the league created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball. The league underwent a name change during the season; it began as the All-American Girls Softball League., but midway through the 1943 season, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). The AAGPBL began with a 12-inch softball but incorporated baseball rules. The new league started with four teams, the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The teams competed through a 108-game schedule, while the first Scholarship Series faced first-half winner Racine against Kenosha, second-half champ, in a Best of Five Series.AAGPBL Rules of Play The strong pitching led to low batting averages, as the league hit a collective .230 average with Racine topping the chart (.246). Just one player, Rockford's Gladys Davis, reached the .300 mark. Only 72 home runs were batted for the four teams. Ten of these homers came from the bat of Eleanor Dapkus with Racine.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000.

He was employed by Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where he was the head of the perioperative cardiac care unit. In addition, he was a member of the European Society of Cardiology Committee for Practice Guidelines and he acted as the Chairperson of the Task Force for the European Society of Cardiology. Scientific misconduct: the 2011/2012 investigation Don Poldermans was conducting research for Erasmus when accusations regarding the integrity of Poldermans‚Äô work were brought forward. In order to investigate this case, Erasmus appointed a Committee for the Investigation of Scientific Integrity. The Committee found Poldermans to have committed misconduct on several counts. The primary studies that have been brought into question are four of the Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography (DECREASE) studies, specifically DECREASE VI, IV, III, and II. DECREASE I was too far in the past to be investigated. First, some of the randomized controlled trials did not obtain written informed consent from the participants before randomly allocating them to different strategies. These actions were a serious breach of medical research conduct. Second, the committee determined that the data were not collected according to the protocol described beforehand and reported in the publications. For example, events such as myocardial infarction were not diagnosed by a panel of independent researchers, but by a single person who made no documentation for the reason for the categorisations, which were later found to be contradictory to the patients' own medical records. Third, the committee determined that, in several cases, these trials had fabricated data. Last, the committee found that untrustworthy data had been knowingly submitted for publication, another breach of proper scientific conduct. After the 2011/2012 investigation A project running at the time of the investigation, DECREASE VI, was abandoned, because patients had not given consent to take part. The manner in which previous data was collected, reported, and occasionally fabricated indicates academic misconduct, bringing the legitimacy of the current data into question. The enquiry decided that DECREASE II need not be retracted because it believed that Dobutamine Stress Echo, the subject of the study, was no longer used in hospitals. This belief appears to be incorrect. DECREASE VI led to two publications, which were also not retracted. No other researchers were disciplined in this inquiry. The Committee informed all parties involved in the funding of the project. Poldermans was dismissed from his position at Erasmus Medical Center. Two professors will supervise the research done by Poldermans‚Äô students and will establish whether or not the projects in question can be completed successfully. If this is not possible, then the professors will find new research projects for the students affected. Don Poldermans acknowledged the committee‚Äôs decision but he claimed that his misconduct was unintended. Without Poldermans' trials, the remaining credible trials suggest that the recommendation for initiation of a perioperative course of beta blocker seems to increase mortality by 27%. The 2014 investigation report Erasmus university issued a third investigation report in 2014. This covered DECREASE I which had not been covered in the previous investigations. It stated that the individual patients enrolled in DECREASE I could not be identified for cross-checking against the medical records. It therefore could not conclude on the accuracy or otherwise of the DECREASE I publications. An independent analysis by British researchers listed inconsistencies in the published DECREASE I reports that put their accuracy into doubt.

The episode was competing against 54th Grammy Awards on CBS which was watched by 39.91 million viewers and held 14.4/32 rating in the 18-49 demographic, Family Guy and American Dad!' on Fox which were watched by 5.03 million viewers and held 2.5/5 rating in the 18-49 demographic and by 3.5 million viewers and had a 1.7/4 and Fear Factor on NBC, which averaged 3.7 million viewers and a 1.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic.. With 6.4 million viewers, \\"Is This What You Call Love?\\" is currently the least watched episode in the history of the series in both viewers and in the 18-49 demographic but that was expected because of The 54th Grammy Awards, which received a major boost in viewership, due to the tribute to Whitney Houston who died a day earlier. The episode was also competing with The Walking Dead on AMC which broke cable viewership records at the time, with 8.1 million viewers and a 4.2 in the 18-49 demographic. The episode gained an additional 2.2 million viewers and 1.0 rating in the week following the original broadcast due to DVR recordings.http://thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2012/02/27/abcs-modern-family- surges-ahead-of-the-voice-idol-and-big-bang-to-rank-as-the-weeks- number-1-series-908112/20120227abc02/ Notes *Although credited, Ricardo Antonio Chavira (Carlos Solis) and Doug Savant (Tom Scavo) did not appear in this episode.

The club was formed in 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The dispute over rent resulted in Everton leaving Anfield for Goodison Park, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Not content for his ground to lay idle, he created his own club: Liverpool. Liverpool joined the Lancashire League on their foundation before the 1892‚Äì93 season. They ended their inaugural season as league champions, and were elected to The Football League soon afterwards. The club remained in The Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League. Liverpool's first team have competed in a number of nationally and regionally contested leagues, and its record against each club faced in these competitions is listed below. The team that Liverpool have met most in league competition is Everton, against whom they have contested 203 league matches; having drawn 68 of these, Everton are the side Liverpool have tied with most in league competition.

Later, on the order of the head of the Prussian Gestapo, prisoners were deported from the penal institution of Gollnow in Pomerania to Sonnenburg, bringing the number of inmates to 1,000. Sonnenburg concentration camp was closed on 23 April 1934. The prison heritage building still exists. Since the beginning of the Second World War in 1939 the concentration camp or punishment camp (Straflager) continued as a concentration and labour camp for alleged anti-German people from the occupied territories until 1945. Amongst its inmates were the resistance fighters, Jean-Baptiste Lebas and Bj√∏rn Egge. The French spy, Ren√© Lefebvre, father of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, succumbed in 1944 to the consequences of imprisonment there.  German staff  The first commandant was police lieutenant (Polizeioberleutnant) Ke√üler. After him came: * Police second lieutenant (Polizeileutnant) Bark * Police lieutenant Siegmund * SA- Sturmf√ºhrer Jahr SA-Sturmf√ºhrer Bahr initially commanded the infamous Berlin SA storm troops (St√ºrme) No. 1 Horst Wessel and No. 33 Mordsturm Maikowski, which were responsible for guarding prisoners. They were reinforced by members of the police. In late April, the Berlin SA men were replaced by others from Frankfurt/Oder. At the end of August the SS took over, as they did in many camps, with 150 men from the 27th SS Regiment (SS-Standarte 27) from Frankfurt/Oder.  Notable prisoners  During the early years of their rule, and long before the start of the war, the Nazi regime mainly imprisoned Communists and Social Democrats in Sonnenburg.

Jack Carr was born Frank Carr in Bayonne, New Jersey to James and Bridgett O'Donnell Carr, Irish immigrants. He was one of eight children.Great Nephew, William Lord Carr worked for a number of animation studios and was a credited animator since at least the early 1930s. When, in 1930, Charles Mintz found a cartoon distributor in Columbia Pictures and moved his operations to California, Mr. Carr was amongst his staff;Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic: a History of American Animated Cartoons. Von Hoffmann Press, Inc., 1980. p. 206 whilst working at the Warner Bros. studio of Leon Schlesinger, he provided the voice of Buddy from 1933 to 1935: he is also a credited animator on one Buddy short, Buddy in Africa. Carr is also credited with naming the cartoon characters Tom and Jerry when Hanna-Barbera had a naming contest amongst the staff; Carr won the $25 prize The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity, Ted Sennett. Hanna and Barbera were said to be unhappy to have their characters named after a popular drink of the time, but history later proved that names having dual associations are the most popular as they are easier for the public to remember Carr family lore.

Discrete Chebyshev transform on the roots grid The discrete chebyshev transform of u(x) at the points {x_n} is given by: : a_m =\\\\frac{p_m}{N}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} u(x_n) T_m (x_n) where: : x_n = -\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{N} (n+\\\\frac{1}{2})\\\\right) : a_m = \\\\frac{p_m}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} u(x_n) \\\\cos\\\\left(m \\\\cos^{-1}(x_n)\\\\right) where p_m =1 \\\\Leftrightarrow m=0 and p_m = 2 otherwise. Using the definition of x_n , : a_m =\\\\frac{p_m}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} u(x_n) \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\pi}{N}(N+n+\\\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\right) : a_m =\\\\frac{p_m}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} u(x_n) (-1)^m\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\pi}{N}(n+\\\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\right) and its inverse transform: : u_n =\\\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} a_m T_m (x_n) (This so happens to the standard Chebyshev series evaluated on the roots grid.) : u_n =\\\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} a_m \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\pi}{N}(N+n+\\\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\right) : \\\\therefore u_n =\\\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} a_m (-1)^m\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\pi}{N}(n+\\\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\right) This can readily be obtained by manipulating the input arguments to a discrete cosine transform. This can be demonstrated using the following MATLAB code: function a=fct(f,l) % x =-cos(pi/N*((0:N-1)'+1/2)); f = f(end:-1:1,:); A = size(f); N = A(1); if exist('A(3)','var') && A(3)~=1 for i=1:A(3) a(:,:,i) = sqrt(2/N) * dct(f(:,:,i)); a(1,:,i) = a(1,:,i) / sqrt(2); end else a = sqrt(2/N) * dct(f(:,:,i)); a(1,:)=a(1,:) / sqrt(2); end The discrete cosine transform (dct) is in fact computed using a fast Fourier transform algorithm in MATLAB. And the inverse transform is given by the MATLAB code: function f=ifct(a,l) % x = -cos(pi/N*((0:N-1)'+1/2)) k = size(a); N=k(1); a = idct(sqrt(N/2) * [a(1,:) * sqrt(2); a(2:end,:)]); end Discrete Chebyshev transform on the extrema grid This transform uses the grid: : x_n=-\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{n\\\\pi}{N}\\\\right) : T_n (x_m) = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi m n}{N}+n\\\\pi\\\\right)=(-1)^n \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi m n}{N}\\\\right) This transform is more difficult to implement by use of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However it is more widely used because it is on the extrema grid which tends to be most useful for boundary value problems. Mostly because it is easier to apply boundary conditions on this grid. There is a discrete (and in fact fast because it performs the dct by using a fast Fourier transform) available at the MATLAB file exchange that was created by Greg von Winckel. So it is omitted here. In this case the transform and its inverse are : u(x_n)=u_n =\\\\sum_{m=0}^{N} a_m T_m (x_n) : a_m =\\\\frac{p_m}{N}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2} (u_0 (-1)^m +u_N)+\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} u_n T_m (x_n)\\\\right] where p_m =1 \\\\Leftrightarrow m=0 and p_m = 2 otherwise.

It is the fourteenth episode of the show's eighth season and was broadcast on February 19, 2012. Plot Orson has moved back in to take care of Bree and she reveals everything about the murder and how it destroyed her relationships with Gaby, Susan and Lynette. Later, Orson refuses to let the other women in and lies to Bree about them visiting. He suggests taking a vacation to Maine since he has recently inherited a property from his late aunt, she agrees to go but first tells him she thinks it's time to make amends with the girls because in a way they saved her by sending him to her. Worried, Orson tells Bree that the girls did visit but said cruel things about her and so she agrees to go without seeing them. It is later revealed that after re-learning to drive he began stalking Bree and was not only aware of the cover up but was also behind the notes Bree had been receiving, all in an attempt to get her back. Gaby is having trouble taking care of the girls, running the house and helping out with his business whilst Carlos is away in rehab. To make matters worse Roy invites himself to stay because Karen has kicked him out although he can't figure out why. Although at first Gaby is uneasy about this, when she sees how much the girls listen to him she is keen to have him stay. So much so that she thwarts any attempts by him or Karen to reconcile. It is later revealed that Karen's cancer has returned and she broke up with Roy so he wouldn't have to go through watching her become ill and die as he did with his first wife. Susan is still trying to convince Julie to keep her baby and suggests to Mike that she try and contact the father. When she finds out the father is, in fact, Porter Scavo she is shocked, but later agrees to support him when he decides he would rather raise his daughter alone than have her adopted. Susan divulges this information to Lynette who is furious and tells Susan that her son is not ready to be a father and that the baby would be better off adopted. She also tries to convince Porter of the same thing but he tells her that he is already in love with his baby and will do everything to take care of her, Lynette is left unconvinced. Julie, meanwhile, tells her mother she cannot forgive her for supporting Porter and taking the decision about her daughter out of her hands. Ben tries to set his property development on fire in order to claim the insurance, but is caught by Mike. The stress of the situation puts Ben in the hospital so Mike goes to Renee and tells her about Ben's troubles with the loan shark. She visits him in the hospital and offers to pay off his debt, but he refuses, telling her he wants to fix everything and be a man she deserves. Renee instead pays off the loan shark without telling Ben in the hopes of ending the situation, but after the loan shark comments on how wealthy she is, it appears that she becomes worried. Reception Critical reception This episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Most commented on the lack of storyline for Gabrielle's character as her being unable to discipline her children had been covered in the past. The revelation that Orson was behind the notes to Bree throughout the season however, was universally praised as it was unexpected and opens up possibilities to exciting episodes for the remaining few episodes., Digital Spy, February 20, 2012, TV Overmind, February 20, 2012 Ratings According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Get Out Of My Life\\" was watched by 7.65 million viewers and held 2.2 rating between 18 and 49 years of age.

This problem can be reduced to that of finding univalent holomorphic maps f, g of the unit disk and its complement into the extended complex plane, both admitting continuous extensions to the closure of their domains, such that the images are complementary Jordan domains and such that on the unit circle they differ by a given quasisymmetric homeomorphism. Several proofs are known using a variety of techniques, including the Beltrami equation, the Hilbert transform on the circle and elementary approximation techniques. describe the first two methods of conformal welding as well as providing numerical computations and applications to the analysis of shapes in the plane. Welding using the Beltrami equation This method was first proposed by . If f is a diffeomorphism of the circle, the Alexander extension gives a way of extending f to a diffeomorphism of the unit disk D: :\\\\displaystyle{F(r,\\\\theta)=r \\\\exp [i\\\\psi(r)g(\\\\theta) + i(1-\\\\psi(r))\\\\theta] ,} where œà is a smooth function with values in [0,1], equal to 0 near 0 and 1 near 1, and :\\\\displaystyle{f(e^{i\\\\theta})=e^{ig(\\\\theta)},} with g(Œ∏ + 2œÄ) = g(Œ∏) + 2œÄ. The extension F can be continued to any larger disk |z< R with R > 1. Accordingly in the unit disc :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\|\\\\mu\\\\|_\\\\infty < 1, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mu(z)=F_{\\\\overline{z}}/F_z.} Now extend Œº to a Beltrami coefficient on the whole of C by setting it equal to 0 for |z‚â• 1. Let G be the corresponding solution of the Beltrami equation: :\\\\displaystyle{G_{\\\\overline{z}}=\\\\mu G_z.} Let F1(z) = G ‚àò F‚àí1(z) for |z‚â§ 1 and F2(z) = G (z) for |z‚â• 1. Thus F1 and F2 are univalent holomorphic maps of |z< 1 and |z> 1 onto the inside and outside of a Jordan curve. They extend continuously to homeomorphisms fi of the unit circle onto the Jordan curve on the boundary. By construction they satisfy the conformal welding condition: :\\\\displaystyle{f=f_1^{-1}\\\\circ f_2.} Welding using the Hilbert transform on the circle The use of the Hilbert transform to establish conformal welding was first suggested by the Georgian mathematicians D.G. Mandzhavidze and B.V. Khvedelidze in 1958. A detailed account was given at the same time by F.D. Gakhov and presented in his classic monograph (). Let en(Œ∏) = einŒ∏ be the standard orthonormal basis of L2(T). Let H2(T) be Hardy space, the closed subspace spanned by the en with n ‚â• 0. Let P be the orthogonal projection onto Hardy space and set T = 2P - I. The operator H = iT is the Hilbert transform on the circle and can be written as a singular integral operator. Given a diffeomorphism f of the unit circle, the task is to determine two univalent holomorphic functions :\\\\displaystyle{f_-(z)=a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \\\\cdots,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f_+(z) =z + b_1z^{-1} +b_2z^{-2}+\\\\cdots,} defined in |z< 1 and |z> 1 and both extending smoothly to the unit circle, mapping onto a Jordan domain and its complement, such that :\\\\displaystyle{f_-(e^{i\\\\theta})=f_+(f(e^{i\\\\theta})).} Let F be the restriction of f+ to the unit circle. Then :\\\\displaystyle{TF=-F + 2e^{i\\\\theta}} and :\\\\displaystyle{TF\\\\circ f= F\\\\circ f.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{T(F\\\\circ f)\\\\circ f^{-1} - T(F)= 2F-2e^{i\\\\theta}.} If V(f) denotes the bounded invertible operator on L2 induced by the diffeomorphism f, then the operator :\\\\displaystyle{K_f=V(f)PV(f)^{-1} - P} is compact, indeed it is given by an operator with smooth kernel because P and T are given by singular integral operators. The equation above then reduces to :\\\\displaystyle{(I-K_f)F=e^{i\\\\theta}.} The operator I ‚àí Kf is a Fredholm operator of index zero. It has zero kernel and is therefore invertible. In fact an element in the kernel would consist of a pair of holomorphic functions on D and Dc which have smooth boundary values on the circle related by f. Since the holomorphic function on Dc vanishes at ‚àû, the positive powers of this pair also provide solutions, which are linearly independent, contradicting the fact that I ‚àí Kf is a Fredholm operator. The above equation therefore has a unique solution F which is smooth and from which f¬± can be reconstructed by reversing the steps above. Indeed, by looking at the equation satisfied by the logarithm of the derivative of F, it follows that F has nowhere vanishing derivative on the unit circle. Moreover F is one-to-one on the circle since if it assumes the value a at different points z1 and z2 then the logarithm of R(z) = (F(z) ‚àí a)/(z - z1)(z ‚àí z2) would satisfy an integral equation known to have no non-zero solutions. Given these properties on the unit circle, the required properties of f¬± then follow from the argument principle.See:  Notes References    Category:Theorems in analysis Category:Complex analysis Category:Riemann surfaces ","title":"Conformal welding"},{"id":"34437111","text":"Neossos is a genus of flies in the family Heleomyzidae.

Blackout fabrics are most commonly found in hotel rooms as curtain linings or drapery fabrics, blocking much of the light that would otherwise enter through a window when the curtains are closed. For travelers, third shift workers, and parents of babies, blackout is an essential element in the bedroom. Besides window coverings, other uses for blackout fabrics include wallpaper, movie projector screens and planetarium domes. Manufacture The process of manufacturing blackout was invented by Baltimore-based Rockland Industries, and involves coating a fabric with layers of foam, or ‚Äòpasses‚Äô. A ‚Äò2-pass‚Äô blackout is produced by applying two passes of foam to a fabric ‚Äì first, a black layer is applied to the fabric, then a white or light-colored layer is applied on top of the black. A ‚Äò3-pass‚Äô blackout is produced by applying a layer of white foam to the fabric first, then a layer of black foam followed by the third and final layer of white or light-colored foam. Uses A ‚Äò3-pass‚Äô blackout can be used as a decorative fabric and blackout lining all in one fabric. A ‚Äò2-pass‚Äô cannot be used this way, because the black foam is visible through the fabric side of the material. In addition to blocking light, blackout fabrics also insulate and have noise-dampening qualities, due to their density and opacity.

Traditional folk music is transmitted in performance; as such, it adapts to audience tastes and available technologies. In the study of folklore, the folk process is the way folk material, especially stories, music, and other art, is transformed and re-adapted in the process of its transmission from person to person and from generation to generation. The folk process defines a community‚Äîthe \\"folk community\\"‚Äîin and through which folklore is transmitted. While there is a place for professional and trained performers in a folk community, it is the act of refinement and creative change by community members within the folk tradition that defines the folk process. History The phrase was originally coined by musicologist Charles Seeger, father of the folk singer Pete Seeger, but the underlying concept goes back to 1907, when Cecil Sharp observed that the transmission of folk songs and the forms they took when they were collected and attested was the result of three factors: continuity, variation, and selection. These factors were expanded on in 1954 by the International Folk Music Council, which wrote that: Operation The transformation and reinterpretation of received material is central to the folk process. The traditional Irish lament \\"Si√∫il A R√∫in\\", with its macaronic mixed language Irish and English lyrics: was reinterpreted in the nineteenth century United States and turned into the song \\"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier\\" or \\"Buttermilk Hill\\", which has several variations, which preserve different parts of the original, as in a version collected by Walt Whitman: or another, anonymous variation: Whitman's version preserved a line of Irish-derived doggerel (Shool, shool, shool agrah); the other version is entirely English. The transformation of the material can be quite thorough. The Child ballad \\"Matty Groves\\", a murder ballad that begins with adultery and ends in a duel and the death of the title protagonist, becomes the American love song \\"Shady Grove\\". The basic tune is often kept intact, sometimes transposed to a major key from the original minor, but the narrative of the original song is no longer found in the American version. Mass culture and the folk process Through the folk process, the subjects of folk song and narrative are adapted to better suit the times; lyrics can be added, or removed; parts that are no longer understood can be re-interpreted or discarded. The result is a new bit of folklore that the next generation will continue to preserve in its new form. The folk process started to become problematic, first, when it began to operate on the copyrighted and commercial products of mass culture, and the appropriation and commercialization by mass culture of folk narrative and music which, being distributed by the mass media, become the newly canonical versions of the tradition. One famous example of the conflict between the desire of artists to assert copyright and the folk tradition is the case of the ballad Scarborough Fair. Scarborough Fair is a traditional British folk song with many variations, which was reworked by Simon and Garfunkel for their 1966 album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, however unlike the artists of previous generations, Simon and Garfunkel asserted sole authorship of the song. The Internet and digital media, enabling consumers of culture to copy, alter, and select bits of both folk and mass culture, has tended to accelerate the folk process. The transformation of mass culture by the folk process goes back to the origins of mass culture; many old and traditional poems and ballads are preserved among the printed broadside ballads. Professionally composed music, such as the parlor ballad Lorena by H. D. L. Webster, were transmitted by performance and became subject to the folk process. Folk and mass culture can cross-pollinate each other; a nineteenth-century broadside, The Unfortunate Lad, became the American cowboy standard Streets of Laredo, the jazz standard St. James Infirmary Blues, and strongly influenced the Marty Robbins hit El Paso.

The worship of tutelary deities and sacred flora and fauna in Hinduism is also recognized as a survival of the pre-Vedic Dravidian religion. Dravidian linguistic influence on early Vedic religion is evident; many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo- Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian. The linguistic evidence for Dravidian impact grows increasingly strong as we move from the Samhitas down through the later Vedic works and into the classical post-Vedic literature. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Dravidians and Indo-Aryans that went on to influence Indian civilization. Classification Scholars do not share a uniform consensus on early Dravidian religion. Some scholars believed that the Dravidian religion was a belief system unique to the Neolithic people of South Asia before the arrival of Indo-Aryans. Dr. Pope believes that in the pre-historic period the Dravidian religion was a precursor to Shaivism and Shaktism. While John B. Magee was of the view that native Dravidian religion prior to 1500 BC was unclear. Other scholars define it as a non-Vedic part of Hinduism. Henry O. Thompson's definition of Hinduism included Dravidian traditions as one of the important foundational element. Sjoberg claims that the Dravidian religion influenced Hinduism more than its Aryan counterpart, Elmore suggests Dravidian belief in afterlife was common and is contrary to the reincarnation concept that evolved somewhere in northern India after the Indo-Aryan migration.Grimes, John A.

Early religious and cultural synthesis Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian. The linguistic evidence for Dravidian impact grows increasingly strong as we move from the Samhitas down through the later Vedic works and into the classical post-Vedic literature. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Dravidians and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, traditions, philosophy, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sramana and Charvaka. Scholars regard the modern Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions. Among its roots are the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India, itself already the product of \\"a composite of the indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations\\", but also the Sramana or renouncer traditions of northeast India, and mesolithic and neolithic cultures of India, such as the religions of the Indus Valley Civilisation, Dravidian traditions, and the local traditions and tribal religions. Religion in ancient Tamilakam Sage Agastya, father of Tamil literature. Ancient Tamil grammatical works Tolkappiyam, the ten anthologies PattuppƒÅ·π≠·π≠u, the eight anthologies E·π≠·π≠uttokai sheds light on early ancient Dravidian religion. Seyyon was glorified as, the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent, as the favored god of the Tamils.Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979). Sivan was also seen as the supreme God. Early iconography of Seyyon and Sivan and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization. The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, thinais, based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these thinai had an associated deity such Seyyon in Kurinji-the hills, Thirumaal in Mullai-the forests, and Korravai in Marutham- the plains, and Wanji-ko in the Neithal-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were Mayyon and Vaali who were all assimilated into Hinduism over time. Typical layout of Dravidian architecture which evolved from koyil as kings residence. Throughout Tamilakam, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance. The king was 'the representative of God on earth‚Äô and lived in a ‚Äúkoyil‚Äù, which means the ‚Äúresidence of a god‚Äù. The Modern Tamil word for temple is koil (). Titual worship was also given to kings. Modern words for god like ‚Äúk≈ç‚Äù ( ‚Äúking‚Äù), ‚Äúi·πüai‚Äù ( ‚Äúemperor‚Äù) and ‚ÄúƒÅ·πá·∏çavar‚Äù ( ‚Äúconqueror‚Äù) now primarily refer to gods. These elements were incorporated later into Hinduism like the legendary marriage of Shiva to Queen Mƒ´nƒÅtchi who ruled Madurai or Wanji-ko, a god who later merged into Indra. Tolkappiyar refers to the Three Crowned Kings as the ‚ÄúThree Glorified by Heaven‚Äù, (). In the Dravidian-speaking South, the concept of divine kingship led to the assumption of major roles by state and temple. The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one and was typically associated with Shaktism. Her worship was accepted in the northern parts of India with various names as Devi, Ksetradevata etc.On the original inhabitants of Bharatavarsa or India, Oppert, Gustav Salomon, 1836-1908, page 17 More recent scholarship has been correcting the misrepresentation made by a section of Westerner and Indian Brahmanical scholars in portrayal of the tradition of goddess. Western scholars like Denobili portrayed Brahmin as \\"gentilism\\" and the goddess tradition as \\"idolatarous\\".Visicssitudes of the Goddess, Sree Padma,goddess explained, page 11 The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones ‚ÄúNatukal‚Äô' had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory. Many Hindu sects such as Bhakti movement and Lingayatism originated in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka respectively. In addition to literary sources, folk festivals, village deities, shamanism, ritual theater and traditions, which are unique to the region, are also good indicators of what early Dravidian people believed/practiced. Ayyanar, guardian folk deity of Tamil Nadu villages The most popular deity is Murugan, he is known as the patron god of the Tamils and is also called Tamil Kadavul (Tamil God).Harold G. Coward,John R. Hinnells,Raymond Brady Williams, The South Asian Religious Diaspora in Britain, Canada, and the United States In Tamil tradition, Murugan is the youngest son and Pillayar the oldest son of Sivan, this differs from the North Indian tradition, which represents Murugan as the oldest son. The goddess Parvati is often depicted as having a green complexion in Tamil Hindu tradition, implying her association with nature. The worship of Amman, also called Mariamman, who is thought to have been derived from an ancient mother goddess is also very common. KanÃ≤nÃ≤agi, the heroine of the CilappatikƒÅrÃ≤am, is worshipped as PattinÃ≤i by many Tamils, particularly in Sri Lanka. There are also many followers of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu, mainly in the southern districts.Dr. R.Ponnus, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India, (Madurai Kamaraj University) Ram Publishers, Page 98 In addition, there are many temples and devotees of Vishnu, Siva, Ganapathi, and the other Hindu deities. In rural Tamil Nadu, many local deities, called aiyyanÃ≤ƒÅrs, are believed to be the spirits of local heroes who protect the village from harm. Their worship often centres around nadukkal, stones erected in memory of heroes who died in battle. This form of worship is mentioned frequently in classical literature and appears to be the surviving remnants of an ancient Tamil tradition. The early Dravidian religion constituted a non-Vedic form of Hinduism in that they were either historically or are at present ƒÄgamic. The Agamas are non-vedic in originMudumby Narasimhachary (Ed) (1976). ƒÄgamaprƒÅmƒÅ·πáya of YƒÅmunƒÅcƒÅrya, Issue 160 of Gaekwad's Oriental Series. Oriental Institute, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. and have been dated either as post-Vedic texts or as pre-Vedic compositions.Nagalingam, Pathmarajah (2009). The Religion of the Agamas. Siddhanta Publications. A large portion of these deities continue to be worshipped as the Village deities of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, and their subsequent influence in South-east Asia, examples of which include the Mariamman temples in Singapore and Vietnam. Worship of anthills, snakes and other forms of guardian deities and heroes are still worshiped in the Konkan coast, Maharashtra proper and a few other parts of India including North India which traces its origins to ancient Dravidian religion which has been influencing formation of mainstream Hinduism for thousands of years. A hero stone, known as ‚ÄúNatukal‚Äù by Tamils and ‚ÄúVirgal‚Äù by Kannadigas, is a memorial commemorating the honorable death of a hero in battle. Erected between the 3rd century BC and the 18th century AD, hero stones are found all over India, most of them in southern India. They often carry inscriptions displaying a variety of adornments, including bas relief panels, frieze, and figures on carved stone. Usually they are in the form of a stone monument and may have an inscription at the bottom with a narrative of the battle. According to the historian Upinder Singh, the largest concentration of such memorial stones are found in Karnataka. About two thousand six hundred and fifty hero stones, the earliest dated to the 5th century have been discovered in Karnataka.Chapter ‚ÄúMemorializing death in stone‚Äù, Singh (2009), p48 The custom of erecting memorial stones dates back to the Iron Age (1000 BCE‚Äì600BCE) though a vast majority were erected between the 5th and 13th centuries AD.  Veriyattam  Veriyattam refers to spirit possession of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases. Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.  Nadukkal  Among the early Tamils the practice of erecting hero stones (nadukkal) had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.  Theyyam  Theyyam is a ritual shaman dance popular in Kerala and parts of Karnataka. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors, is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains. The early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence‚Äîa growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners. The layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male guardian deity () has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon. Folk dance rituals *There are multiple folk dance rituals in Karnataka used for the worship of gramadevata. One of these from Tulu areas is Yakshagana, literally meansing the song (gana) of the yaksha, (nature spirits). Yakshagana is the scholastic name (used for the last 200 years) for art forms formerly known as kƒì·∏∑ike, ƒÅ·π≠a, bayalƒÅ·π≠a, and da≈õƒÅvatƒÅra ().

It is operated by Harlem River Yard Ventures, part of the Galesi Group, under a 99-year lease with the State of New York signed in 1991. The yard owes its name to the property's prior and current use as a freight rail yard. However, only a 28-acre portion of the site has been retained for intermodal rail use, with rail traffic to and from the yard limited to municipal solid waste shipment. Beginning in the late 1990s, Harlem River Yards has been the site of substantial commercial development, including a New York Post printing plant, a waste treatment plant, and a FedEx distribution center. History Harlem River Yards was a 96-acre freight rail yard owned by the Penn Central Railroad, which in turn acquired the yard and associated lines in 1969 when it consummated a regulatory-induced, forced merger with the New Haven Railroad.Port of New York Authority; New York Harbor Terminal, July 1943 (Republished in TrainWeb) When the Penn Central went into bankruptcy in the 1970s, the State of New York condemned the rail yard and placed it under the stewardship of the state's Department of Transportation. The yards were a key component of New York's Full Freight Access Program, a multi-decade effort to create manufacturing jobs by modernizing rail freight transportation in New York City and Long Island. This project involved raising vertical clearance on the rail lines along the east shore of the Hudson River from the Albany area into New York City and Long Island to accommodate Trailer on Flatcar (TOFC) intermodal freight transport, and the construction of the Oak Point Link. However, efforts to develop an intermodal rail facility at Harlem River Yards were frustrated due to multiple factors, including a lack of commercial interest and shifting political priorities. The Oak Point Link finally opened in 1998, but connected to a small intermodal facility at Harlem River Yards which used a small 28-acre portion of the site. In 1991, the State of New York entered into a 99-year least agreement with Harlem River Yard Ventures, a subsidiary of the Galesi Group, to develop and operate Harlem River Yards as a mixed-use industrial park. Harlem River Yard Ventures proceeded with industrial development of Harlem River Yards, with a New York Post paper printing and distribution facility built on the site in 1998, and FedEx distribution facility built on the site in 2007. In 2012, online grocery retailer FreshDirect proposed moving its main food distribution hub from Long Island City in Queens to the Harlem River Yards. Bronx Borough President Rub√©n D√≠az, Jr. has said that he expects the new FreshDirect facility to create roughly 1,000 jobs in the Bronx over the next decade. However, some residents in the South Bronx protested the development and organized efforts to promote conversion of the Harlem River Yards into a park space. A lawsuit brought by a South Bronx advocacy group challenged the environmental review process for the FreshDirect facility, and also attempted to void the lease of the Harlem River Yards property to Harlem River Yard Ventures as well as Harlem River Yard Ventures' sublease of land to FreshDirect. This lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by unanimous appellate decision in 2014. Construction on FreshDirect's Harlem River Yards facility began in December 2014. In April 2018, The Related Companies and Somerset Partners announced plans to build a mixed-use complex above the rail yard adjacent to the Willis Avenue Bridge. The development is planned to contain 1,779 apartments and a 26,000-seat stadium for New York City FC.

The past several decades have seen an increasing number of laws and regulations regarding wetlands, their surroundings, and their inhabitants, creating protections through several different outlets. Some of the most important have been and are the Migratory Bird Act, Swampbuster, and the Clean Water Act. Legislation Some of the laws and regulations with notable impact on wetland conservation are: *Migratory Bird Conservation Act, ch. 257, , (1929) ::Established a commission to approve the acquisition of migratory bird habitat. *Rivers and Harbors Act, , (1938) ::Provides that \\"due regard\\" be given to wildlife conservation in planning Federal water projects. *Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, , (1954) *Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (1956) ::Authorizes the development and distribution of fish and wildlife information and the development of policies and procedures relating to fish and wildlife. *Federal Water Project Recreation Act, ,(1965) ::Recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement must be considered by Federal water projects. Authorizes Federal funds for acquiring land for waterfowl refuges. *National Wildlife Refuge Acts (1966, improvement amended 1997) ::Numerous statutes establish refuges, many of which contain significant wetland acreage. *National Environmental Policy Act, , (1969) ::Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement of all major Federal actions significantly affecting the environment *Federal Water Pollution Control, ,(Clean Water Act), Section 404 (1972) ::Regulates many activities that involve the disposal of dredged and fill materials in waters of the United States, including many wetlands. *Ramsar Convention (Treaty), (adopted 1973, enforced from 1975) ::Convention maintains a list of wetlands of international importance and encourages the wise use of wetlands. *Executive Order 11988 & 11990, Protection of Floodplains/Wetlands, (1977) ::Requires Federal agencies to minimize impacts of Federal activities on floodplains/wetlands. *Food Security Act (Swampbuster), , (1985) ::\\"Swampbuster\\" program suspends agricultural subsidies for farmers who convert wetlands to agriculture. *U.S. Tax Code Reform Act, , (1986) ::Eliminates incentives for clearing land.

Capital gains on converted wetlands treated as income. *New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, New Jersey (July 1, 1987) ::To preserve the purity and integrity of freshwater wetlands from unnecessary and undesirable disturbance. *North American Wetlands Conservation Act, (1989) ::Provides matching grants to organizations and individuals who have developed partnerships to carry out wetlands conservation projects in the United States, Canada, and Mexico for the benefit of waterfowl and other wetland-dependent migratory birds. *Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act, , (1990) ::Wetland Reserve Program purchases perpetual non-development easements on farmed wetlands. Subsidizes restoration of croplands to wetlands. National Agencies There are a number of government agencies in the United States that are in some way concerned with the protection of wetlands. The top five are the Army Corps of Engineers (ACoE), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Votteler, T.H. and T.A. Muir. (1996) Wetland protection legislation. In: Fretwell JD, Williams JS and Redman PJ (eds), National Water Summary on Wetland Resources, pp 57‚Äì64. USGS Water-Supply Paper 2425. US Geological Survey, Washington, DC. They each oversee a different aspect of wetlands conservation, from funding other groups or individuals, to regulating wetland use, to establishing new areas for wetlands restoration. State level Most states of the US have their own set of agencies that also oversee some wetland conservation. These are usually in the form of something like a Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or Fish and Game Department. These groups typically control licensing, hunting limits, prairie Private There are many private groups that practice wetlands conservation. The largest of these players is Ducks Unlimited, as they are one of a few focused nearly entirely on wetlands. Their mission statement is: > Ducks Unlimited conserves, restores, and manages wetlands and associated > habitats for North America's waterfowl. These habitats also benefit other > wildlife and people.Ducks Unlimited > Conservation They have conserved more than of wetlands in North America and influenced another . The Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society, and Pheasants Forever are a few more of the large private groups that focus part of their time and resources on wetlands conservation. Individuals should not be overlooked in their contributions, as they are often the most direct route to protecting and restoring wetlands.  Conservation strategies Nearly all wetland conservation work is done through one of 4 channels. They consist of easements, land purchase, revolving land, and monetary funding. Conservation easements can meet the needs of interested owners of working farms, ranches, timberlands, sporting properties and recreational lands, who wish to protect valuable natural resources while retaining ownership of the property.DU > Conservation > How we conserve In locations where wildlife habitat has been degraded & the land is for sale, DU will seek to acquire it. Once purchased, the habitat will be restored and easements will be placed on land to perpetually protect resource values. In special cases, where intact waterfowl habitat is at imminent risk or of high importance, groups or individuals may seek to acquire the property instead. Once purchased, the habitat is restored and can be entered into easements to ensure their continued protection or be kept in their ownership. Monetary funding exists most often as a subsidy, grant, or tax-break from the government. Instead of doing all the work and labor themselves, they seek to encourage others to take on those tasks themselves. All of these methods are important to ensuring protection for wetlands, now and in the future.

In 1984 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The two-story house was built in 1898 in the Queen Anne style of architecture. The exterior walls are of rusticated stone cut from a local quarry operated by Merritt Black himself. The stone is a bit unusual for Queen Anne, but the varied surface finishes, the bay windows, the 3-story corner tower, the asymmetry, and the complex roof are all typical of the style. If the shape of the house looks a bit abrupt for Queen Anne, it may be because it originally had broad porches wrapping around several sides, which have been removed. Inside are oak doors and stairs and maple floors. In the basement are rooms for vegetable and fruit storage. The house was designed by the Smith brothers of Appleton. The carpenter was Gus Keck, the mason Joseph Schwenderman, and the painter Walter Cuel. With Merritt Black's father Andrew was born in Ohio and came to Wisconsin in 1846. He bought hundreds of acres in north Kaukauna and began to farm, and to speculate in farmlands. J. Merritt, the youngest surviving son, helped his father farm and operated a stone quarry. In 1898 he built the house described above. He later drilled wells, farmed and worked as a realtor. After J. Merritt died, his son Merritt A. lived in the house, working in real estate and insurance. The house was known as the Black Castle.

It is a residential area that lies between Beaver Avenue, which is a major north-south artery, on the west and Ashby Park on the east. The historic period of the housing was 1925-1941. with The street layout follows a curving pattern, which differentiates it from the grid pattern of the surrounding area. The streets also feature a mature tree canopy. The historic district has 148 properties of which 99 are houses and 49 are garages. Ninety- one properties are considered contributing properties and 57 are noncontributing. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1992. It is a part of the Suburban Development in Des Moines Between the World Wars, 1918--1941 MPS. Architecture The houses generally follow the conventional Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival styles as well a local variation of the Tudor style called ‚ÄúBeaverdale Brick.‚Äù There are both brick and frame structures that are 1¬Ω and 2-stories and feature intersecting gables. A few of the houses are also constructed of limestone and of concrete block masonry. Some of the houses have a garage integrated into the houses design. Others were not built with garages and they were added at some point after World War II, and therefore do not contribute to the historic nature of the neighborhood. The more modern garages are also located behind the house and do not detract from the historic appearance of the neighborhood. In general, the garages are front gable structures that were built to house one car. Most of the houses are modest in scale, which reflects their construction during the Great Depression, but there are a few examples of the high-style.

They were the first two interred in the Poets' Square. Patea (1894‚Äì1950) Patea composed 55 poems whose lyrics and harmonies expressed deeply traditional Mizo sentiments. His lyrics are mainly about lamentation, praise and heavenly sentiments. Damhauhva (1909‚Äì72) Damhauhva wrote 51 poems highly prized for their literary qualities in Mizo poetry. His poetical words emphasizing natural beauties and its harmonies are well matched. He composed many fine poems. The values of human life with regards to nature are expressed with poetical words. Second phase: 1996 In course of time, there was an attempt to commemorate famous poets and writers whose fame spread throughout Mizoram and its adjoining regions. The process of selecting poets and writers was also strictly carried out. They had, to some extent, imitated what were found in Poets' Corner, the name traditionally given to a section of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey.

The term \\"Nature Reserve\\" (, shmorat tev‚Äôa) was originally IDF slang and refer to the fact that they were primarily placed in the countryside away from habitation and were declared off-limits to the IDF during the war, due to fear of high casualties. Human Rights Watch wrote in an extensive report published about a year after the war that \\"we found strong evidence that Hezbollah stored most of its rockets and missiles in bunkers and weapon storage facilities located in uninhabited fields, forests and valleys,‚Ä¶ and that Hezbollah fired the vast majority of its rockets from pre-prepared positions outside villages.\\" The Israeli special forces unit Maglan stumbled into a Nature Reserve near Maroun ar-Ras and suffered heavy casualties. \\"We didn‚Äôt know what hit us,\\" said one of the Maglan soldiers. \\"In seconds we had two dead including the combat medic.\\" \\"We expected a tent and three Kalashnikovs ‚Äî that was the intelligence we were given. Instead, we found a hydraulic steel door leading to a very well-equipped network of underground tunnels.\\" Original link inaccessible, alternative link Harel, Amos and Avi Issacharoff, 34 Days: Israel, Hezbollah, and the War in Lebanon, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008. P. 132 After the battle of Maroun ar-Ras, the head of IDF Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Udi Adam forbade any further attacks on Nature Reserves. \\"A nature reserve can swallow an entire brigade,\\" he said.Harel and Issacharoff, p. 137 According to Haaretz \\"[t]hroughout the war the General Staff and the Northern Command restricted offensive operations into these areas, following the initial encounter‚Ä¶[at] the \\"nature reserve\\" code-named Shaked near the town of Maroun al-Ras.\\" The well entrenched Nature Reserves were not vulnerable to heavy artillery or airstrikes. The decision not to attack these positions, sometimes only hundreds of meters from the Israeli border, made it possible for Hezbollah to continue firing rockets over Northern Israel throughout the war. Most of the short range Katyusha rockets fired on Israel during the war were fired from Nature Reserves. In December 2007 the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee issued the findings of its investigation into the 2006 war in Lebanon. It condemned the senior IDF command in unusually severe terms and said that the army's methods of fighting \\"played into Hezbollah's hands.\\" It was especially critical of the delay in launching a ground war and refraining from attacking the Nature Reserves. Another Nature Reserve was found at Labbouna, near a forest undergrowth hillside a few hundred meters from the Israeli border and some kilometer from the UNIFIL headquarters at Naqoura. The area was completely sealed off by Hezbollah in 2002 and declared a \\"military zone\\". Neither Israel nor UNIFIL understood what Hezbollah was up to until the 2006 war. \\"We never saw them build anything,\\" a high ranking UNIFIL officer told Nicholas Blanford. \\"They must have brought the cement in by the spoonful.\\" Hezbollah maintained a clearly visible outpost nearby that was immediately shelled by the IDF on July 12, after the abduction of the two Israeli soldiers. This outpost however was only a decoy that was already abandoned and the fighters had relocated to the covered positions in the Nature Reserves. Hezbollah had a commanding view of northern Israel all the way to Acre and Haifa. From the first day of the war this Nature reserve was a source of almost constant Katyusha rocket fire. Israel repeatedly tried to knock out the launch site by the use massive artillery and air strikes, including the use of cluster bombs and phosphorus grenades. But the rockets continued to be fired until the last hour before the ceasefire. Hezbollah fighters completely commanded the terrain to the south and claimed to have destroyed an armored bulldozer and a tank only 6 meters into Lebanese territory, on Aug 8, 2006. The IDF confirmed that Capt.(res.) Gilad Balhasan, 28, of Karmiel, and St.-Sgt.(res.) Yesamu Yalau, 26, of Or Yehuda were killed in the incident. The IDF however bypassed Labbouna and had it effectively surrounded for the latter part of the war but there are no reports of any IDF attempt to capture the area. Instead Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at northern Israel until the ceasefire agreement on Aug. 14.Andrew Exum, Hizballah at War - A Military Assessment, WINEP Policy Focus #63 December 2006, page 12 Hezbollah fighters who were stationed at Labbouna during the war claim to have launched a raid on an IDF position inside Israeli territory, killing and injuring several Israeli soldiers, including an officer. IDF confirmed that an officer, Maj.Colonel (res.) Nimrod Hillel, was killed in the area of Labbouna on August 10. According to Hezbollah all of the resistance fighters at Labbouna survived the war but several fighters reported spitting blood and experiencing prolonged health effects after inhaling white phosphorus. After the ceasefire Hezbollah withdrew from the area in accordance with UN resolution 1701. The IDF then entered the area and destroyed a large bunker system before withdrawing from Lebanon. Towards the end of the war the IDF \\"chanced\\" upon an what was then an unknown well-equipped bunker system overlooking the road where the abduction of the two soldiers took place.Harel and Issacharoff, p. 12 Nicholas Blanford visited an untouched and apparently abandoned Nature Reserve near Rashaf more than six months after the war. The area is about six kilometers from the Israeli border and saw heavy fighting in the last days of the war. The large deserted bunker was accessed through a narrow 6 meter shaft that led into a 60 meters long main passage, with steel doors every 10 meters. Blanford estimated that the main section was 35‚Äì50 meters under the surface. The facility was fitted with a communications room, air condition and electricity as well as a bathroom and a kitchen. It had multiple entrances and exits. After the war UNIFIL searched southern Lebanon and found 33 Nature Reserves scattered across the countryside. In January 2007 IDF found two underground bunkers, connected by a tunnel, on Israeli territory along the Lebanese border. The bunkers contained food and weapons equipment and were destroyed by the IDF.

Discovery Rusingaceros is known from the holotype KNM-RU 2821, an almost perfectly preserved skull and associated mandible and from the paratype KNM-RU 2822, a maxilla and associated mandible. Both specimen were collected in the early Miocene site (Burdigalian stage) of Rusinga located in Lake Victoria in Kenya, from the Kulu Formation, dating to about 17.5 million years ago. Additional specimens described by Hooijer in 1966 from the Songhor and Napak localities, as well as more recently reported occurrences, are highly fragmentary and based mostly on isolated teeth. Rusingaceros represents the earliest rhino \\"of modern type, i.e., with a strong nasal and smaller frontal horn\\". This suggests that Rusingaceros belongs to subtribe Rhinocerotina, within the tribe Rhinocerotini. Etymology Rusingaceros was first named by Denis Geraads in 2010 and the type species is Rusingaceros leakeyi. It was originally described by Hooijer in 1966 as a new species of Dicerorhinus.

Early life O'Reilly was born in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, Ireland. He emigrated with his father to New York City in 1816, where he then changed the spelling of his surname to O'Rielly. With his friend Luther Tucker he went to Rochester, New York, and organized the Rochester Daily Advertiser. He was active in Jacksonian politics. The postmaster, Amos Kendall, appointed him to the Rochester post office. O'Reilly chose a young Scottish immigrant, James D. Reid, as his assistant.Robert Luther Thompson, Wiring A Continent--The History of the Telegraph Industry in the United States 1832-1866, Princeton University Press, 1947 He married Marcia Brooks, daughter of Micah Brooks, in 1830. Civic accomplishments O'Reilly was one of the Rochester citizens advocating the deepening and improvement of the Erie Canal. He could see that revenues from tolls were not sufficient for major improvements. They advocated borrowing at a time when many considered it immoral. He promoted a change in the Rochester city charter in 1841 to support free public education. This was opposed by many who preferred education only for a privileged class. He was elected to the subsequent Board of Education. He promoted and became president of the Young Men's Association that created the first library open to the public in the city.Dexter Perkins, \\"Henry O'Reilly\\", Rochester History, Jan. 1945, vol. vii, no. 1 Publishing O'Reilly was one of the first authors to write a survey of Rochester and its immediate surroundings, first with a fourteen-page tract Rochester in 1835 : brief sketches of the present condition of the city of Rochester. He followed that with a massive publication just three years later, describing in great detail, the Settlement in the West : sketches of Rochester : with incidental notices of western New-York ... (1838, 504 pp., published by William Alling), known colloquially as Sketches of Rochester. Telegraph entrepreneur O'Reilly signed an ambiguous contract on June 13, 1845, with Amos Kendall, agent of Samuel Morse, for a telegraph line from the eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes. With others he formed the Atlantic, Lake & Mississippi Valley Telegraph system composed of six independent units including the Atlantic & Ohio Telegraph Company. Its superintendent was James D. Reid.James D. Reid, The Telegraph in America--Its Founders Promoters and Noted Men, New York Arno Press, 1974 The ambiguity of the contract and O'Reilly's aggressive interpretation led to conflict with Kendall and an acrimonious court action. The subsequent case, O'Reilly v. Morse, has been highly influential in the development of the law of patent-eligibility. When he lost this case, his telegraphy empire declined.

The case was taken over by the Crown Attorney's office, and Z√ºndel was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in jail.

She was one of Scott's most celebrated characters during the 19th century; she was renowned as an example of an honest, upright, sincere, highly religious person. The name \\"Jeanie Deans\\" was given to several pubs, ships, railway locomotives, an opera, a play, a poem, a song, a hybrid rose, an antipodean potato, and a geriatric unit in a hospital. They all take their name from Scott's heroine. There was also a so-called Jeanie Deans' Cottage in Edinburgh. It was demolished in 1965. Plot When Jeanie Deans' sister, Effie, is wrongly convicted of murdering her own child, Jeanie travels, partly by foot, all the way to London. Her plan is to appeal to Queen Caroline and receive a pardon for her sister who languishes in prison awaiting execution. She begins walking on her bare feet to save her shoes but puts them on when she passes through towns and villages.Sir Walter Scott, The Heart of Midlothian, 1818, (Edinburgh: Nelson [c.1900]), ch. XXVIII, pp. 355 & 359. By a series of improbable adventures, involving the true abductors of her sister's baby son, she finds George Staunton alias Robertson who had fathered the child. Thereafter she travels on by coach and on reaching London she seeks out the Duke of Argyll who takes her to meet Queen Caroline at Richmond LodgeRichmond Lodge. She impresses the Queen with her eloquence, spoken in broad Scots.As above, ch. XXXVII, pp. 489‚Äì490. The Queen promises to intercede with King George II, and she ensures that her sister is granted a pardon, on pain of being banished from Scotland for fourteen years. When Jeanie returns to Scotland, she finds that the Duke of Argyll had given her father land to superintend at Rosneath in Argyll.As above, ch. XLII, p. 536. Scott mistakenly refers to Rosneath as an island. It is in fact a peninsula. She is also overjoyed to find that her fianc√©, Reuben Butler, has been appointed Minister at the neighbouring kirk of Knocktarlitie.As above, ch. XLV, p. 579. She subsequently marries Butler and raises three children named David, Reuben and Euphemia. Jeanie's sister, Effie, pays her a clandestine visit to inform her that she had married her lover who was now Sir George Staunton.As above, ch. XVI, p. 588. Jeanie later learns that her sister's child had not been murdered but was sold to a Highland brigand and was reared to a life of robbery and violence. Sir George is later shot by his own sonAs above, ch. LII, pp. 664‚Äì666. who escapes to America, where he gets into trouble, joins a tribe of Native Americans and is heard of no more. As Lady Staunton, Effie takes her place in London society but eventually retires to a French convent, much to her sister's disappointment at her relinquishing her father's religion. Origin Sir Walter Scott wrote that he had learned the story from an unsigned, undated letter, whose writer had learned it in turn from a Mrs. Helen Lawson Goldie of Dumfries. The original of Jeanie Deans was Helen Walker, whose experience was more austere than the fiction Scott wrote. Helen Walker died in late 1791. Sir Walter Scott erected a monument at Helen Walker's grave in the parish of Irongray, about six miles from Dumfries. Jeanie Deans Cottage Plaque above Jeanie Deans Tryst pub, St Leonards, Edinburgh.

The brigade was numbered as 149th (Northumberland) Brigade in 1915 and served with the 50th (Northumbrian) Division on the Western Front throughout World War I. Due to losses suffered in the Ludendorf Offensive in 1918, it had to be comprehensively reorganized. Reformed as the Northumberland Brigade post-war, it was broken up before the outbreak of World War II. History Formation Under the terms of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9), the Northumberland Brigade was formed in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It was Headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne and consisted of four infantry battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers and a Transport and Supply Company: :4th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (T.F.) - HQ at Hexham :5th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (T.F.) - HQ at Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne :6th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (T.F.) - HQ at Northumberland Road, Newcastle upon Tyne :7th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (T.F.) - HQ at Alnwick :Northumberland Brigade Company, ASC (T.F.) - at Newcastle upon Tyne It was assigned to the Northumbrian Division. World War I The brigade was mobilized on the outbreak of the war and posted to the Tyne Defences. The battalions were given fractional designations (e.g. 1/4th Battalion) with the formation of the 2nd Line battalions in 1914. In April 1915, the brigade was posted to France and on 14 May was redesignated as 149th (Northumberland) Brigade (the division became 50th (Northumbrian) Division). The brigade served with the 50th Division on the Western Front for the rest of the war. In 1915, it took part in the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In 1917, it took part in the Battle of Arras and the Third Battle of Ypres. As a result of the losses suffered in the Ludendorf Offensive (First Battle of the Somme and Battle of the Lys), the brigade had to be comprehensively reorganized. On 15 July 1918, the Northumberland Fusiliers battalions were reduced to cadre and transferred to Lines of Communication duties; they were replaced by two battalions from Salonika (3rd Royal Fusiliers ex 85th Brigade, 28th Division and 13th Black Watch ex 81st Brigade, 27th Division) and another (2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers) that had been in France since August 1914. Thereafter, it took part in the Battles of the Hindenburg Line and the Final Advance in Picardy. Order of battle The brigade commanded the following units during the war: *1/4th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (reduced to cadre and left 15 July 1918) *1/5th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (reduced to cadre and left 15 July 1918) *1/6th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (reduced to cadre and left 15 July 1918) *1/7th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (left 10 February 1918 and joined 42nd (East Lancashire) Division as Pioneers) *1/5th Battalion, Border Regiment (joined 5 May 1915, left for 151st Brigade on 20 December 1915) *3rd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (joined 15 July 1918) *13th (Scottish Horse) Battalion, Black Watch (joined 15 July 1918) *2nd Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers (joined 15 July 1918) *149th Machine Gun Company (formed 6 February 1916, moved to 50th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps on 1 March 1918) *149th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 18 June 1916) Post-war The 50th Division had crossed the Sambre and reached Solre-le-Ch√¢teau on 10 November 1918 when it was relieved. Demobilization started in December and by 19 March 1919 the division had ceased to exist in France. The Northumbrian Division was reformed again in England on 1 April 1920 with the same composition as pre- war. The four original battalions were reformed in the Territorial Army on 7 February 1920. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was reorganized as a Motor Division which saw a reduction from three to two brigades. * 4th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was converted to a motorcycle battalion in 1938, assigned to 50th Division. * 5th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was converted to a searchlight battalion on 1 November 1938 as 5th Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (53rd Searchlight Regiment), assigned to 30th (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. * 6th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was converted to 43rd Battalion (6th (City) Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers), Royal Tank Corps on 1 November 1938, assigned to 25th Army Tank Brigade. * 7th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was converted to a machinegun battalion in Northumbrian Area, Northern Command and the brigade ceased to exist.

The company was established in 1943. In the 1990s the company was split into a rolling stock company Nova Sorefame and a dam equipment company Hidrosorefame; Hidrosorefame was acquired by Alstom, the rolling stock business became part of ABB's rail transport division, later Adtranz, and in 2001 part of Bombardier transportation; it was closed in 2005.  Company history  Sorefame was founded in 1943, capitalised using state funds, but run as a private business. The company had two main product lines: railway equipment such as rolling stock, and equipment for hydro-electric reservoirs, such as dam gates. In 1987 Sorefame underwent restructuring with MOMPOR, forming a new company Sociedade de Montagens Metalomec√¢nicas (SMM); in 1990 SMM merged with Sorefame, MAGUE and SEPSA resulting to form Grupo SENETE, in which ABB Group had a 40% share. In the 1990s the company was split into two entities, one rolling stock company, and a dam equipment company Hidro- sorefame, by 1994 ABB had a 70% share of SENETE, and the following year Hidro- Sorefame became ABB-hidro. SENETE was fully acquired by ABB in 1997, and in 1999 ABB's power business was include in a power generation joint venture with Alstom: ABB ALSTOM POWER. In 2000 Alstom acquired ABB's stake in the joint venture, with the former 'Hidro-sorefame' still as a subentity of the firm. ABB merged its rail transportation division with that of Daimler-Benz forming Adtranz, subsequently divesting itself of the interest in 1999. Adtranz was eventually sold to Bombardier Transportation ‚Äî which became owner of the manufacturing facility in Amadora. Under ABB and later Adtranz and Bombardier the rolling stock company became increasing an assembly plant ‚Äî with the resultant loss of many jobs. In 2001 during Bombardier's restructuring after the acquisition of Adtranz the plant in Amadora was decided to be one of Bombardier's seven final manufacturing plants in Europe, with it also being used for assembly in the case of undercapacity elsewhere. Limited demand and overcapacity in rolling stock manufacturing capacity across Europe resulted in the closure of the Sorefame railway factory in 2004. In 2005 part the Amadora plant was expropriated by Refer, with Bombardier being offered approximately ‚Ç¨7million for less than half of the site; the site was to be used for training and development of railway related skills and technology, and the expropriation was justified as being in the public interest. In 2008 the land formally became the property of Comboios de Portugal (CP), to be occupied by CP subsidiary EMEF (Empresa de Manuten√ß√£o de Equipamento Ferrovi√°rio) The remainder of the site was sold to glass container manufacturer Sotancro. An investment of ‚Ç¨500 million is expected to re-establish a rail vehicle business in Portugal, to be built in M√©dio Tejo.  Products   Railway rolling stock  Stainless steel diesel railcar 0614, built by Sorefame, at Porto Campanh√£ station. Corail design, at Braga From the 1960s the company specialised in the manufacture of stainless steel carriages, principally for the Portuguese Railways (CP). The stainless steel carriages were built at the company's factory in Amadora under licence from the Budd Company of the USA. During the years of the Salazar regime (the Estado Novo), Sorefame supplied the vast majority of Portugal's railway rolling stock (as well as for Portugal's then colonies), but the Carnation Revolution of 1974 and economic liberalisation, especially following Portugal's entry to the European Union in 1986, resulted in far greater international competition. Sorefame also assembled diesel and electric locomotives for CP (such as the S√©rie 1900 in 1981), notably using components designed and supplied by the French company Alstom. The firm had also fabricated the shells for Boeing Vertol's 2400 series railcars constructed for the Chicago Transit Authority in 1976.https://scontent- atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19748379_10209178289837249_3345564850997588943_n.jpg?oh=840ad94b62b8742543918f1c24cd8582&oe;=5A0E5834  Dam equipment   References   External links  Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Portugal Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1943 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 2005 Category:2005 disestablishments in Portugal Category:Portuguese companies established in 1943 ","title":"Sorefame"},{"id":"34437970","text":"James Wright (1819-1887) was a notable New Zealand potter.

History Origins A former ward block now converted to residential use seen in 2009. The hospital was designed for the London County Council by George Thomas Hine, consultant architect to the Commissioners in Lunacy to the London County Council), following a Compact Arrow plan first used at Bexley Asylum at Bexley in Kent. It was opened in 1902 and was the second hospital in the Epsom Cluster, a group of five mental institutions on the Horton Estate to the west of Epsom. During the two World Wars the hospital was commandeered as a military hospital and the existing patients were transferred elsewhere. Malaria research For much of the 20th century the hospital played an important role in the development of induced malaria treatment as cure for general paralysis of the insane, a form of advanced syphilis. The treatment involved infecting patients with malaria which caused a high fever meant to kill the spirochetes which caused the disease. A laboratory based in the 14-bed isolation unit became a national centre for mosquito breeding and sent infected mosquitoes to all British hospitals which used the treatment. By the 1970s the unit had become the World Health Organization's Regional Malarial Centre for Europe but was rendered obsolete in 1975 by the increasing use of penicillin to treat syphilitic symptoms. The hospital was also notable for its pioneering work in music therapy in the 1960s. Wolvercote Clinic In 1995 the hospital was chosen as the site of a pioneering treatment centre for sex-offenders. The Wolvercote Clinic specialised in the intensive treatment of convicted child sex offenders and gained an international reputation for effective treatment with non- reoffending rates estimated at 80%. Treatment was carried out in secure accommodation for up to 12 months at a time and involved teaching patients to acknowledge their sexual responses to children and to take control of their own behaviour. The clinic closed in 2002 following news that the Hospital site was to be sold for redevelopment. Decline and redevelopment At its peak in 1971, the hospital had 1,587 beds and treated 1,438 patients. By 1975, however, the number of beds had fallen to 1,200 and patient numbers continued to decline until closure. The hospital officially closed in 1997, although the Wolvercote Clinic and a small psychiatric unit known as Horton Haven remained open. The hospital was sold for development in 2002 and most of the buildings were subsequently demolished. The chapel, administration block, water tower and some wards and villas were retained for conversion and incorporation into a new village development on the site. As of 2009 most of the site had been redeveloped as housing and apartments. The water tower, chapel and former superintendent's residence were empty awaiting conversion while the Horton Haven and original gate lodge remained in use for psychiatric treatment. By October 2012, the water tower had been demolished and a small commemorative plaque stood on the site. The superintendent's residence had become dangerously derelict and the chapel was empty but kept maintained and secured by its owners Epsom and Ewell Borough Council. The Horton Haven continues to provide psychiatric services on the site.

The unit was originally known as Hawthorne's Battalion, but the battalion is most often referred to as Chew's Sharpshooter Battalion. The unit was eventually consolidated with the 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. Organization On October 19, 1862, at Camp Reagan, Arkansas Colonel A. T. Hawthorne was assigned to the command of an unarmed battalion composed of the companies of Dawson, Tumlinson, Perkins and Hailey and the new unit was referred to as Hawthorn's Battalion Arkansas Volunteers. The four companies that made up Hawthorne's Battalion were: *Company A - Captain Elbert Dawson's Company (Madison County) Organized September 3, 1862 on King's River, Madison County. Marched thence to Elm Springs and was mustered into service on September 12, 1862, as Arkansas Infantry. *Company B - Captain Wiley Tumlinson's Company (Scott County) Organized July 4, 1862 and served as cavalry until September 16. *Company C - Captain B.T. Hailey's Company (Marion, Carroll and Benton Counties) Organized in June, 1862 and served as cavalry until August 24. *Company D - Captain Samuel W. Perkin's Company (Scott County) Organized in June/July, 1862 and served as cavalry until September 16. Dawson's Company was the last to be organized and apparently never served as cavalry. The other three companies mentioned above spent approximately two months serving together as cavalry in Gipson's Battalion Mounted Rifles. They were eventually dismounted at the approximate dates mentioned above to serve as infantry. It appears that a portion of Tumlinson's Company was divided and placed into Perkins' Company as two men from the former company show up on the casualty list of Company C at the battle of Prairie Grove. On Oct 23, 1862 an order to Colonel C. W. Adams, (Adams' Arkansas Infantry Regiment) countermanded a previous order assigning Captain Chew as Lieutenant Colonel of Adams' Regiment \\"in deference to the wishes of men and officers of the regiment in their memorandum to the Major General commanding.\\" Two weeks later, Major Hawthorn was elected colonel of the 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. On November 3, 1862 Captain Robert E. Chew was appointed major and placed in command of the battalion which then became known as \\"Chew's Sharpshooter Battalion.\\" On November 5, 1862 an order from Colonel Brooks at Camp Hindman mentioned a \\"memorial\\" of the commissioned officers of Hawthorne's Battalion to have Captain Chew appointed Major to fill the vacancy caused by promotion of Major Hawthorne. It appears that this battalion was a sharpshooter battalion in name only. Had it survived after the battle of Prairie Grove it may have become one in time. Sharpshooters were equipped in the same manner as infantry, with the standard rifle or rifle- musket; some were even armed for a time with smoothbore weapons. There was no difference in the organization of what was called a \\"sharpshooter battalion\\" and a regular light infantry battalion. The term \\"battalion\\" implies that the unit was organized with fewer than the full ten companies required for a regiment. Tactically, these units were specialists in skirmishing. \\"Sniping\\" ‚Äì at least in the manner we think of it today ‚Äì was the main purpose of a \\"sharpshooter\\" unit. Civil War infantry units received little formal instruction in rifle marksmanship; however, skirmishers were expected to deliver individual, aimed fire at targets of opportunity rather than the massed volleys of the infantry line of battle. No known roster of the battalion exists. The casualty list of this unit at Prairie Grove did survive as it was published in the True Democrat newspaper in Little Rock on December 31, 1862. Service On December 1, 1862 Brigadier General James F. Fagan asked for the consolidation of Major Chew's Arkansas Infantry battalion and Hawthorne's 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment both of his brigade. While this order was not approved until after the Battle of Prairie Grove, the battalion and Hawthorn's 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment fought side by side during the battle. It is well documented that all four infantry regiments of Fagan's Brigade sent out their own skirmishers, so Chew's men did not act as skirmishers for the entire brigade. Their primary role was serving as an infantry battalion alongside Hawthorn's Regiment during the fighting at Prairie Grove. In that role, they took part in the charges of Fagan's Brigade driving back the 20th Wisconsin, 19th Iowa, and 37th Illinois and 26th Indiana regiments when these Union troops ascended the ridge. On the day of the Battle of Prairie Grove, only one of the original company commanders was present. The other three are absent, most likely due to illness. At the time of the battle on December 7, the battalion's command was as follows: *Major Robert E. Chew, commanding: *Company A- 1st Lieutenant Willis Greenlee *Company B- 1st Lieutenant Jacob C. Moles *Company C- Captain Samuel W. Perkins *Company D- Lieutenant Samuel L. Hayhurst (specific rank not noted, probably 1st lieutenant) Major Robert E. Chew, was killed during the Battle of Prairie Grove. He was born circa 1822 in Virginia, the son of John Winslow and Ann Thornton (Voss) Chew. The family moved to Humphrey Co., Tennessee and by 1850 they were living in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In the census of that year the father was listed as the postmaster and Robert, 28, was listed as a farmer. Robert's father died in 1855 and at some point the family moved away probably to Missouri. A query in the Confederate Veteran magazine by Chew's nephew stated that his uncle belonged to a Tennessee regiment and was killed at Prairie Grove. The nephew said he was told that his uncle's sword and watch had been recovered from his body and was hoping these items could be reunited with the family. Chew had, in fact, served as a captain in Company H, 2nd Tennessee Infantry (Col. J. Knox Walker commanding). This regiment was formed entirely in Memphis, so Robert apparently had moved to this city sometime before the war started. The Official Records mentioned that Capt. Chew had assisted in the recapture of an artillery piece at the battle of Belmont, Missouri. At Shiloh the 2nd Tennessee Infantry suffered severe casualties and afterwards was consolidated into four companies. This left Captain Chew without a company to command. Apparently through Arkansas connections, he managed to get transferred back across the river to serve as a staff officer for Gen. Thomas C. Hindman. In that capacity, late in September, 1862, he met face to face with General William T. Sherman when he hand delivered a letter to him from General Hindman and returned with a reply. Sometime in October November, 1862 Robert Chew received a promotion to major and was given the assignment of commanding his own sharpshooter battalion. Adding up the numbers in the casualty list that appeared in the True Democrat, Chew's Battalion went into action with 12 officers and 104 enlisted men. They suffered 3 killed, 22 wounded (five of them mortally), and 5 missing for a total loss of 30. Consolidation with Hawthorn's Regiment On December 14, 1862, Major General Thomas C. Hindman endorsed General Fagan's request to consolidate Chew's Battalion and Hathorn's 39th Arkansas Infantry: Major General Hindman mentioned the battalion again on December 23, 1862 in a letter to General Theophilus Hunter Holmes: Chew's Battalion was consolidated into Hawthorn's Regiment in the following manner: *Company A, Chew's Battalion became Company G, Hawthorn's 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. *Company B, Chew's Battalion became Company K, Hawthorn's 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. It appears this also included the members of Tumlinson's Company who had gone over to Perkin's Company. They rejoined their former company and became part of Company K. *Companies C and D, Chew's Battalion became Company H, Hawthorn's 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. Captain Samuel W. Perkins was apparently forced out by this consolidation and does not appear on the roster of Hawthorn's Regiment. From its initial service as Chew's Battalion through its consolidation with the 39th Arkansas Infantry, its members participated in the following engagements: * Battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas, December 7, 1862 * Battle of Helena, Arkansas July 4, 1863 * Battle of Little Rock, Arkansas, September 10, 1863 * Red River Campaign, Arkansas March‚ÄìMay, 1864 * Battle of Jenkins Ferry, Arkansas April 30, 1864 Surrender The survivors of Chew's Battalion surrendered with the remnants of the 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and the rest of the Department of the Trans-Mississippi at Marshall, Texas on May 26, 1865.

Olson in which he examines in depth the non-literary works of Stanley Fish, a critic of 17th century literature.  Summary  The book begins with an analysis of Fish's perspective on English studies as an academic discipline, as developed in Professional Correctness: Literary Studies and Political Change. Chapter 2 examines a principal argument in Fish's writings: that general principles cannot inform specific practice. Olson then explores Fish's contention that rhetoric underlies epistemology. Chapter 4 is the transcript of an interview with Fish that Olson conducted in 1991. Chapter 5 is a transcript of an interview with Fish that Olson conducted in 2000. In them, Fish explores reaffirms his conviction that rhetoric is the ‚Äúnecessary center‚Äù of epistemology.  Foreword and afterword  J. Hillis Miller contributes an afterword to the book in which he reflects on Fish's work and its contribution to contemporary understandings of the interrelationships among rhetoric, epistemology, and belief. Fish himself contributes a foreword.  Bibliography  The book includes a comprehensive bibliography of Fish's works.  Critical reception  A number of scholars have cited and analyzedWalhout, Mark. \\"Rhetorical Faith: the Literary Hermeneutics of Stanley Fish.(and \\"Justifying Belief. Stanley Fish and the Work of Rhetoric\\")(Book Review)\\". Christianity and Literature, January 1, 2003 via Highbeam (subscription required) the contribution of Justifying Belief to rhetorical and literary scholarship. In College Literature, Thomas West praises Justifying Belief‚Äôs exclusive focus on Fish's nonliterary work and its clear explanation of how it articulates a postmodern, antifoundational philosophical position. A Canadian scholar, Greg Maillet, writing in Religion and Literature, judges Justifying Belief to be an informative explication of Fish's antifoundationalist rhetoric. Ulf Schulenberg, a scholar at the University of Bremen in Germany, writes in American Studies that Justifying Belief is a clear explication of Fish's theoretical work, although he criticizes Olson for focusing only on certain representative texts of Fish, and for not being critical of other aspects of Fish's work.

Youth career Frank Mitchell began his football career with Glasgow Friendly Boys in 1908, playing for Milngavie Allander in 1909 and Maryhill in 1910 before signing with Scottish League Motherwell on 24 November 1911. Senior career On 20 May 1913, after a loan spell at Celtic in 1912 where he didn‚Äôt play a first-team game, he joined First Division Everton, making his debut against Burnley that September. He played both sides of the First World War for the Goodison Park team but in each of his three peacetime seasons he was largely back up to Tommy Fern, making only 2 League appearances as they won the League Championship in 1914‚Äì15, and playing 24 matches in total for The Toffees. On 6 January 1921, having had enough of life on the bench, he chose to transfer-list at his own request. In March 1920, the Liverpool Echo reported the Scottish amateur international was, \\"the only goalkeeper of the day to play in spectacles\\".(note possibly an inadvertent reference to another goalkeeping Mitchell, James/Fred of Manchester City, who did play in spectacles). On 4 February 1921, he moved across Stanley Park to Liverpool for ¬£1250, but he was never likely to displace the great Elisha Scott nor Scottish international Kenneth Campbell. However, he did enjoy a run of 15 consecutive first division matches in the second half of the 1920‚Äì21 season, only being on the losing side three times. In 1921, the Derby Daily Telegraph said Mitchell was, \\"quite a dapper figure... this canny Scot from Elgin. The Anfield club think the world of him, and rightly so, for he has a glorious knack of anticipation, and gets to shots in wonderful style\\". He played on just three more occasions, the only games in the 1921‚Äì22 season Scott missed. On 20 January 1923, Mitchell broke his wrist playing for Liverpool reserves against Port Vale and on 23 June, during the summer of 1923, Mitchell had joined his third Merseyside team, Tranmere Rovers. In two seasons at Prenton Park he made 63 appearances. He finished his career with moves to non-league Bangor City in 1925 and Blue Circle Cement a year later. Death Frank spent his last 12 years employed by the Northgate Brewery in Chester, he passed away on Saturday, 18 January 1958 and is interned at Blacon Cemetery.

Shattuck Jr. (2004) The Episcopalians. New York: Church Publishing, p. 253. was a prominent social and religious leader in the Episcopal Church in the United States who helped found the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross as well as the Colonel Daniel Putnam Association. Early life Emily Malbone Morgan, born in Hartford, Connecticut, was the youngest child and only daughter born to merchant Henry Kirke Morgan (1819-1911) and his devout wife, the former Emily Malbone Brinley (1824-1907). Emily Morgan never married and ultimately survived all her brothers: Edward (1857-1874), Henry (1854-1931), William (1850-1936), and George (1848-1908). Her parents could trace their ancestry to colonial times, and her brother George became a prominent Episcopal priest and Rector of Christ Church in New Haven, Connecticut in 1887 (a position he held until his death in an automobile accident two decades later). The house in which she was born and raised had previously belonged to the parents of J. Pierpont Morgan Emily was mostly home schooled by her mother (including via travel to Europe), and throughout her life had many operations for thyroid and other conditions, but became known for her good humor and management gifts. The family belonged to Trinity Church in Hartford, and her mother corresponded with some in the Oxford Movement. Emily briefly attended Miss Haines's school in Hartford. As a teenager, Emily became interested in writing, as well as involved in girls' clubs and an organization called the United Workers. Career In 1883, Morgan's childhood friend, Adelyn Howard, fell ill with a hip disease, which made her a lonely invalid in a town in which she had no friends or family. The following year, Morgan, with Howard and Harriet Hastings of Wellesley, Massachusetts founded the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross, to allow the shut-in Adelyn‚Äîand other religious women who valued thanksgiving, intercessory prayer, and simplicity of life‚Äîto pray and work for social justice. Morgan had a talent for providing hospitality, and considered her \\"greatest desire...has always been to make tired people rested and happy.\\" The group ministered to women working in the nearby textile mills, in part by establishing houses throughout the northeastern United States where such working class women and their children could vacation. In 1889, two years after moving to New Haven, Morgan began her writing career, publishing A Little White Shadow, the proceeds of which she used to fund vacation homes. That same year she established the first of many, Heartsease in Saybrook, Connecticut for \\"tired women, girls and children.\\" As such, Morgan can be considered part of the Deaconess movement in which over 5000 Protestant women participated circa 1890. In 1901, Morgan purchased what became their headquarters and retreat center, in Byfield, Massachusetts, which was named Adelynrood upon its renovation in 1915 (remembering both Howard, who had died in 1898, and an old word for \\"cross\\"). Another home with daily religious services attended by Protestants, Jews and Catholics, was called Beulahland. In 1906, Morgan bought the Putnam Elms, the Windham County, Connecticut home of Morgan's maternal great grandfather Colonel Daniel Putnam from 1791 until his death in 1831. She also helped found the Colonel Daniel Putnam Association in 1910. In her later years, Morgan led a Sunday School class at Trinity Church, Boston. Legacy Emily Malbone Morgan was buried in Hartford's Spring Grove Cemetery. The Episcopal Church (USA) remembers her liturgically on February 26.Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints. New York: Church Publishing (2010), pp. 244-45. Her cousin, Daniel Putnam Brinley (1879-1963), became a well-known muralist, as well as a leading Episcopalian, and her biographer Vida Dutton Scudder is also honored on the Episcopal liturgical calendar (on October 10). The Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross currently has approximately eight hundred members and continues to operate retreat centers.

St. Grigoris led an Armenian mission to convert the Massagetae tribesmen into Christianity. The mission gained true success when the missionaries managed to turn three of Sanesan's own sons into Christianity. Suspicious of St. Grigoris, Sanesan ordered to execute the saint on the plain of Vatnean by tying him to a wild horse. His children fled the royal palace together with St. Grigoris‚Äô missionaries who carried with them St. Grigoris‚Äô body.

The monastery was destroyed by the Hun soldiers and the corpses of the killed were burned. The present-day chapel is a 17th-century structure. It is a single nave basilica constructed from the blocks of local coarse-cut sandstone. One side of the chapel is below the ground while the other is built on bare rock. There are Armenian khachkars near the chapel. The monastery offers a unique panoramic view to the southern part of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, up to the River Araxes.

For his debut season, he was named the Cuban National Series Rookie of the Year. Concepci√≥n defected from Cuba while in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where the Cuban national baseball team was participating in the World Port Tournament in June 2011, the same tournament where Aroldis Chapman defected from Cuba in 2009. Concepci√≥n established residency in Mexico. Major League Baseball declared him a free agent in January 2012. He is working out at a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic for MLB teams in preparation of signing a contract. Minor Leagues Concepci√≥n agreed to sign with the Chicago Cubs in February 2012, pending a physical. The deal, worth $6 million over five years, became official on March 11, 2012. The Cubs outrighted Concepci√≥n to the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League after the 2012 season. Minors The Cubs assigned Concepci√≥n to the Arizona Fall League following the 2014 season. He began the 2015 season with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. He began the 2016 season with the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern League, and was promoted to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Chicago Cubs Concepci√≥n was promoted to the Cubs on June 21, 2016. He struck out the first batter he faced in his major league debut that night. He made three appearances in 2016 with a 3.86 ERA. The Cubs eventually won the 2016 World Series, ending their 108-year drought. Concepci√≥n was not present during the playoffs, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time and won his first World Series title. The Cubs non-tendered Concepci√≥n after the season. He was released on May 6, 2017. Scouting report Concepci√≥n is and slender. He throws a fastball, which registers in the low 90s (miles per hour), and he also features a curveball and a change-up. In his pitching motion, he throws across his body, which creates deception in his delivery, but could prevent him from being consistent.

Life  His parents were Duke Przemko I of Opava and his first wife, Anna of Lutz (d. 1405). Around 1420, Wenceslaus II married to Elisabeth of Krava≈ô. After his father's death in 1433, Wenceslaus II took up the guardianship of his younger half-brothers William, Ernest and Przemko II, while his younger brother Nicholas IV styled himself Lord of Zlat√© Hory. Although their father had stipulated in his will that they should rule the ducht jointly, the brothers divided their inheritance around 1435. William and Ernest received shares of Opava; the Duchy of G≈Çubczyce was split off for WenceslasAccording to :cs:V√°clav II. Opavsk√Ω, the split was made around 1420, hence before their father's death and a palace at Charles Square in Prague. The youngest brother, Przemko II, was destined for an ecclesiastical career and did not receive a share of the duchy. When Nicholas IV died in 1437, Wenclaus II inherited Zlat√© Hory. In late February 1428, during the Hussite Wars, Wenceslaus II managed to stave off the complete destruction of G≈Çubczyce by concluding a treaty with the Hussites. On 27 December 1428, he participated in the Battle of Stary Wielis≈Çaw, in which John I, the last Piast duke of M√ºnsterberg, died. In 1436, Duke Nicholas V of Krnov occupied G≈Çubczyce without giving any justification. Wenceclaus II then occupied the city of ≈ªory in return. In 1437, a compromise was reached. Due to financial difficulties, Wenclaus had to mortgage Zlat√© Hory and Edel≈°tejn Castle to Duke Bolko V of Opole in 1440. Wenceslaus II died between 1445 and 1447. His possessions were inherited by his sons John I and John II. John I died in 1454 and John II inherited his share.

Founded in 2008 by Milwaukee entrepreneurs Josh Fraundorf and James Godsil, Sweet Water's stated mission was to provide fresh, safe food for the community by employing methods of aquaponics and hydroponics that produce a variety of consumables while minimizing its impact on the local environment. History Sweet Water Organics incorporated in 2008 and broke ground on its facility in 2009. Former business partners Josh Fraundort and James Godsil founded the organization in the hopes of creating an urban, sustainable fish and vegetable farm. The first fish were added to the aquaponics system in July 2009, including 2,400 yellow perch and 33,000 tilapia. By mid-2010 Sweet Water was selling about 150 pounds of produce a week and had sold 3,000 perch. This model of production ran into problems however, and an award-winning 2012 investigative story in the Bay View Compass by Michael Timm exposed serious financial and management problems. Sweet Water ceased production the following year and was unable to pay back its loans to the city. Urban Farm Sweet Water's reclamation and revitalization projects were inspired by former basketball player and MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant-winner Will Allen. The farm was situated in a formerly abandoned 6.5 acre building complex and utilized four 11,000 gallon raceways dug directly into the concrete floor to house the fish. Expansions to the facility were to be paid for in part by a $250,000 loan from the City of Milwaukee that would have been entirely forgiven if it had created 45 jobs by the end of 2014. When Sweet Water folded, it was unable to pay back its loans.

SRI International (SRI), originally known as the Stanford Research Institute, is one of the world's largest contract research institutes. SRI, based in Menlo Park, California, was established by the trustees of Stanford University in 1946 as a center of innovation to support economic development in the region. In 1970, SRI formally separated from Stanford University and, in 1977, became known as SRI International. The separation was a belated response to Vietnam war protesters at Stanford University who believed that SRI's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)-funded work was essentially making the university part of the military‚Äìindustrial complex. Sarnoff Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of SRI since 1988, was fully integrated into SRI in January 2011. SRI's focus areas include telecommunication, computing, economic development and science and technology policy, education, energy and the environment, engineering systems, pharmaceuticals and health sciences, homeland security and national defense, materials and structures, video processing, computer vision, and robotics. SRI currently employs about 2500 people, and has an alumni association. SRI has had a chief executive of some form since its establishment. Prior to the split with Stanford University, the position was known as the director; after the split, it is known as the company's president and CEO. SRI has had nine so far, including William F. Talbot (1946‚Äì1947), Jesse E. Hobson (1947‚Äì1955), E. Finley Carter (1956‚Äì1963), Charles Anderson (1968‚Äì1979), William F. Miller (1979‚Äì1990), James J. Tietjen (1990‚Äì1993), William P.

SRI also has had a board of directors since its inception, which has served to both guide and provide opportunities for the organization. The current board of directors includes Marianne Byerwalter (chairman), Charles A. Holloway (vice chairman), Samuel Armacost, Vern Clark, William A. Jeffrey (current SRI president and CEO), Robert L. Joss, Leslie F. Kenne, Henry Kressel, David Liddle, Philip J. Quigley, Wendell Wierenga, and John J. Young, Jr. Many notable SRI researchers were involved with the Augmentation Research Center. These include Principal Investigator Douglas Engelbart, the developer of the modern GUI; William English, who contributed to the design of Engelbart's computer mouse; Jeff Rulifson, the primary software architect of the NLS; Elizabeth J. Feinler, who ran the Network Information Center; and David Maynard, who would help found Electronic Arts. The Artificial Intelligence Center has also produced many notable alumni, many of whom contributed to Shakey the robot; these include project manager Charles Rosen as well as Nils Nilsson, Bertram Raphael, Richard O. Duda, Peter E. Hart, Richard Fikes and Richard Waldinger. Artificial intelligence researcher Gary Hendrix went on to found Symantec. The CALO project (and its spin-off, Siri) also produced notable names including C. Raymond Perrault and Adam Cheyer.

La F√™te villageoise) is an oil-on-canvas by French artist of the Baroque Claude Lorrain (real name Claude Gell√©e), painted in 1639 and given to Louis XIV in 1693 together with its companion Seaport at Sunset, by landscape architect and gardener Andr√© Le N√¥tre. It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. History Claude's Liber Veritatis, a register in which he recorded and drew the paintings he had done, has a note on the back of the drawing for the F√™te (No. 13) that the picture had been painted for Urban VIII. Other sources also state that the artist painted a Village F√™te and a Seaport at Sunset for Urban VIII, but these two paintings were sold by Prince Barberini in 1798.The respective Louvre webpage states: \\"La F√™te villageoise\\" et son pendant, le \\"Port de mer au soleil couchant\\", sont des r√©p√©titions autographes de tableaux peints en 1637 pour le pape Urbain VIII Barberini (Grande-Bretagne, collection Northumberland). (The Village F√™te and its companion \\"Seaport at Sunset\\" are signed replicas of landscape painted in 1637 for Pope Urban VIII Barberini) The Louvre painting must therefore be a replica painted by Claude Lorrain after the lost original. Another copy dated 1669 was in the possession of Lord Yarborough in England, and yet another in the Stroganovs collection, St. Petersburg. Several other replicas and copies exist. This particular painting, painted fairly early in the artist's career, reveals the influence of Flemish art. The composition, with a group of trees in the centre, and openings on either side through which the light appears, was often used by Flemish landscape painters from the time of Bruegel: Paul and Matthew Bril frequently employed it, and Lorrain continued in their tradition in Rome. In accordance with classic 16th century procedure, the bridge harmoniously unites the middle and far distance. Through the opening on the right can be seen a city bathed in a golden mist, more characteristic of the campagna romana (Roman countryside) than of the North. Following the usual practice of studios of the Low Countries, Lorrain often employed other artists to paint the little figures in his pictures; but this does not seem to have been the case here, to judge by the unity of conception between figures and landscape.M.

Musical career After leaving the Peace Corps, Moore mailed Sub Pop Records a four-song unsolicited demo in January 2007 and was signed by the label to record his first album Stray Age, which was co-produced by Joe Chiccarelli. In 2010, Moore joined with fellow Kentucky musician Ben Sollee to record an album titled Dear Companion, which was produced by and also features Jim James of My Morning Jacket and Monsters of Folk. Dear Companion aims to create awareness of the problems surrounding mountaintop removal coal mining in Appalachia, with Moore and Sollee donating their artist profits from the album to Appalachian Voices in support of the organization's national campaign to end mountaintop removal mining. In 2010, Moore toured with Ben Sollee and Jim James with stops in Brooklyn and at the Newport Folk Festival where Moore also performed with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. In January 2011, Moore released a gospel album, In the Cool of the Day, which was inspired by an old in-house Steinway piano he played during a studio session at WVXU Radio in Cincinnati. To promote his new album, Moore toured the UK and Ireland with Iron and Wine in March 2011. Also in 2011, Moore founded the record label Ol Kentuck Recordings. The first Ol Kentuck release was Maiden Radio's Lullabies. In May 2012, Moore released Farthest Field on the Ol Kentuck Recordings label. The album is a duo-project between Moore and frequent collaborator, Joan Shelley, a Louisville, Kentucky-based singer and songwriter.

A member of the family of Spani, which ruled Drivast, in the mid-15th century he settled in Venice and served as a diplomat of the republic in the Ottoman Empire.  Family  A member of the Spani family he claimed that he was descended from several imperial Byzantine families. In Gjon Muzaka's 1510 work Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi he is mentioned as a descendant of Emperor Theodosius, although it is unclear to whom it refers as there were three Byzantine emperors named Theodosius. The Byzantine author Andreas Angelos Komnenos mentions Alexios III Angelos as his great-great-great grandfather in his work Constitutio Ordinis Constantiniani Equestris. According to that account his father was Michael, Duke of Drivast and his mother Helena Span. The surname Span or Spani probably derives from the Greek word spanos (beardless). In Muzaka's work Miliza Brankovic, daughter of Djuradj Brankovic is mentioned as his wife. Span's progeny included: Demetrio, Costantino, Adrianna, Angela, Demetria and Lucia Span. Karl Hopf has also included another son named Alessandro.  Relations with Venice  Span's activities were closely related to the Venetian ones in Albania. Gabriel Trivisano, proveditor of Venice in Albania, includes Span in the group of the Albanian nobles that were favourable to Venice and informed him about the political conditions in Albania. Span played an important role as an intermediary during the peace negotiations between Venice and the Ottoman Empire represented by Mahmud Pasha in the late 1460s. For his services he received a stipend of 200 ducats per year and eventually incorporated a castle mentioned as Chiro into the Venetian area of control (Venetian Albania).

A remaining stretch on the border between Drenthe and the districts Emsland and Betheim is now a nature reserve, the Internationaler Naturpark Bourtanger Moor-Bargerveen. Shape and size The Bourtange Swamp had the shape of a V. The western leg covered the valley of the Hunze and ranged towards the city of Groningen. The western part was bordered by the Hondsrug. The eastern leg was located in the valley of the Ems. Between these two legs lays Westerwolde. At its greatest extent the swamp was about 3000 km¬≤. History The swamp arose around 5000 BC. The area was already inhabited before this happened, as shown by archeological finds such as the one at Hoetsmansmeer in Groningen. These finds are attributed to nomads from the Mesolithic. Eventually these people left because of the growing swamp. Near Valthe - Ter Apel and Nieuw-Dordrecht remnants of roads through the bog were found, dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. From a military point of view the swamp had an important function as a protective barrier, especially between 1580 and 1850. The swamp played an important role during the wars between Groningen and M√ºnster In places with passages through or along the bog, strongholds were built. Bourtange, Oudeschans, Nieuweschans, Valtherschans and Emmerschans are examples of these places. Cultivation Initially cultivation only occurred at the edges of the swamp. The harvested peat was a source of fuel. During the second half of the Middle Ages the monasteries of Aduard and Essen played an important role in cultivating the bog. In the Middle Ages some places at the edges of the bog were drained for growing rye. The drainage caused soil settling and the area became more vulnerable to floodings. Between 1360 and 1500 parts in the northeast were washed away by the Dollart. In the 16th century large-scale peat harvesting began. The Frisian method, using canals, was introduced. At first most peat harvesting was done at the river Hunze near the city of Groningen. The peat could be transported to the city via this small river. In the 17th century, Westerwolde came under control of the city of Groningen and the peat harvesting became more large-scaled Johan de la Haye and Johan Sems designed a line right through the western 'leg' of the bog, de Semslinie. De Semslinie is a straight line between Wolfsbarge (a village near the Zuidlaardermeer) and Ter Apel. Nowadays it is the border between Drenthe and the Province of Groningen. The Stadskanaal (City canal), which was dug in the 18th century, largely follows the Semslinie. This canal played a significant role in the large-scale peat harvesting. The areas that were cultivated were called veenkoloni√´n (peat colonies). Due to peat harvesting and drainage the remaining swamp became a lot drier. This was bad for the military function of the eastern branch. Therefore, dikes were built near Bourtange to keep water there. Also colonists from Germany, who grew buckwheat, arrived in the Dutch part of the bog. In order to make the soil suitable to grow buckwheat the peat had to be burned. Because of the inconvenience it brought, it was banned in 1925. During the 19th century peat as a fuel, got competition from coal and peat harvesting became less profitable. In the second half of the 19th century de another important canal was dug, the Verlengde Hoogeveensche Vaart. This resulted in more peat harvesting in the southern points of the bog. In the 20th century peat was no longer the main product from the bog, but activated charcoal, turfstrooisel (a sort of compost) and potting soil became important products. No new canals were dug and products from the bog was being largely transported to factories via narrow gauge railways. From there it was transported by ship, tram engine, train or truck. After the Amsterdamse Veld in southeast Drenthe was stripped of its peat, the harvesting of peat and other products from the bog stopped. A remaining part of the bog and surroundings including the Amsterdamse Veld are now part of the Bargerveen Nature Reserve, a Ramsar site. In Germany peat harvesting continued in the 21st century. Bog bodies Roter Franz Several bog bodies were found in the bog, including the Weerdinge Men (found near Weerdinge in Drenthe), Aschbroeken Man, also from Drenthe, Roter Franz (Neu Versen in Emsland) and the Kibbelgaarn body (Kibbelgaarn in Groningen) References * Category:Landforms of Groningen (province) Category:Bogs of the Netherlands ","title":"Bourtange moor"},{"id":"34438487","text":"Ba'ath Party is a pan-Arab political party.

Eligibility and Benefits  CalWORKs provides cash aid to parents, as well as a variety of services intended to help them find and prepare for employment. The most current requirements, and application instructions, can be found on the CDSS CalWORKs website; the main requirements are: * residing in California, * being either pregnant or responsible for a child under 19 years of age, * being a U.S. national, citizen, legal alien, or permanent resident, * having low or very low income and other resources, and * being either under-employed (working for very low wages), unemployed, or about to become unemployed. To receive benefits, parents must fulfill requirements such as working 30 hours per week and/or applying for a specified number of jobs per week and/or participating in training and readiness programs. This makes CalWORKs a form of workfare. There is also a lifetime cap of 48 months of benefits received, with some benefits restricted to 24 months. Only 50% of CalWORKs recipients are still enrolled one year after they first entered the program, and only 33% remain past two years. Two years after they first enrolled, the average recipient has used only 9 months of benefits.  Effects  While the long- term effects of CalWORKs on California as a whole are complex and multi- faceted, some immediate effects on those receiving aid are easier to quantify. The resources available to each Californian (i.e. their income, accounting for taxes and benefits such as medical care) can be compared to an estimate of the resources required to meet their basic needs (a poverty threshold varying based on factors such as family size and local cost-of-living) to label them as ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù of poverty, and thus determine a poverty rate for the state. Several such measures are calculated, including the Census Bureau‚Äôs Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and the Public Policy Institute of California‚Äôs California Poverty Measure (CPM). The current CPM poverty rate in is 20%, but it is estimated it would be 21% without CalWORKs benefits. That 1 percentage point reduction corresponds to about 380,000 Californians kept \\"out\\" of poverty by the program. Of all welfare programs in the state, only CalFresh and earned income tax credits (the federal EITC and the new CalEITC) are responsible for larger reductions (2 percentage points each). This is a larger reduction than the nation-wide average for TANF programs, but by other metrics CalWORKs performs on-par with other states. As far as can be determined from Census (CPS) data, CalWORKs achieves similar effects for low- income families as programs in comparable states. Specifically, no significant differences were found in poverty rates, unemployment rates, TANF (CalWORKs) enrollment rates, or education/training enrollment rates when comparing likely CalWORKs-eligible families. Looking beyond this binary in-or-out of poverty type of effect, CalWORKs' welfare-to-work nature is important for understanding how it affects Californians participating in it. Conditioning the provision of welfare benefits on work requirements increases the burdens on families trying not to 'fall through the cracks' between safety net programs. Even without work requirements, families face application processes for the various separate welfare programs in California that require considerable time, effort, and diligence‚Äîand often yield one or more rejections. Work requirements are an additional burden in that process as well as barrier rejecting more families from receiving CalWORKs aid, whether intentionally (e.g. for a parent who is choosing not to work) or unintentionally (e.g. for a parent that is unable to meet the requirements). Workfare policies also add burdens to those who do receive aid, which again are unintentional in some cases, such as parents left unemployed by a contraction in the labor market being required to apply for weekly quotas of (scarcely available) jobs or attend job-readiness classes. These differences between welfare programs without work requirements and workfare programs like CalWORKs that are inter-connected with the labor market make workfare programs less able to aid parents that are already doing as much as they can to secure jobs that would provide sufficient income. This creates what Eva Bertram describes as \\"a three-sided trap, defined by a lack of assistance for the nonworking poor, inadequate support for those in low-wage jobs, and few exits from the low-wage sector to middle-class jobs.\\" Other researchers have identified as a cause for concern the decreased time CalWORKs participants are able to spend parenting their children due to increased time working in the formal sector instead. Despite these hardships associated with welfare-to-work programs, CalWORKs is generally viewed favorably by participants. In particular, the job search components are viewed as helpful in obtaining a job for unemployed participants. Indeed, 91% of those leaving the program in 2001 were currently employed, and 97% had been employed at some point while enrolled. The majority of those staying in the program or returning after a brief period not enrolled had been employed while in the program as well. While CalWORKs seems to be effective at getting participants some employment, the quality of that employment is a bigger challenge. The large number of participants who are employed and receiving benefits at the same time illustrate that neither CalWORKs' benefits nor their wages are alone sufficient to meet their family's needs. Indeed, most of those with jobs have extremely low wages (well below their poverty thresholds on average) and little opportunity for advancement. Participants identified a lack of support from CalWORKs for improving inadequate employment or for maintaining employment once hired. In short, unemployed parents in search of jobs are often able to gain employment through CalWORKs, but that does not translate directly to earning sufficient income to meet their family's needs.  Administration  It is managed by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS), but is operated and administered locally by the 58 counties of California. In Los Angeles County, the county Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) administers CalWORKs. It has a caseload larger than any other jurisdiction except the States of California and New York and an annual budget of over $3 billion.  First Nations and CalWORKs  Federally recognized native tribes are also eligible to receive federal TANF funding to administer TANF programs (\\"Tribal TANF\\"). The State of California also provides funding to supplement the TANF grants received by tribes located within the State. This is allotted based on the number of families receiving benefits from each Tribal TANF program. For Federally recognized tribes that do not implement TANF programs, county CalWORKs administrators are required to make CalWORKs benefits available. Members of unrecognized tribes are treated by the counties as residents, and so can receive CalWORKs as well.  History  CalWORKs was created by the Welfare-to-Work Act of 1997.Assembly Bill 1542. It replaced the former Greater Avenues to Independence (GAIN) program, the California implementation of the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. At the Federal level, AFDC was replaced with TANF in 1996, bringing work requirements that were stricter than those of the AFDC program, and a new cap on individuals' lifetime benefits. While these requirements for participants were stricter, TANF did give more freedom to states to design their implementations of the program than they had with the AFDC. The California Legislature initially created CalWORKs to be more generous than many other states' TANF implementations, but has since reformed it to be generally more austere. The lifetime benefit cap, for example, was initially set at 60 months but was reduced in 2011 to 48 months, and split in 2012 so that partial restrictions applied after 24 months.  Federal Influence  Although states have broad freedom in the design and implementation of their TANF programs, they must meet certain requirements to receive Federal funds. This puts the generosity or austerity of CalWORKs to some degree under the control of Federal legislation, and it has lately been growing more austere, as described above. The effects of such reductions in benefits are of course varied and complex. California conducted a controlled experiment of a 15% reduction in maximum benefits (as well as other reductions) of the AFDC program beginning in 1991 that illustrates some of these impacts. After 7 years, the employment rates and average wages were somewhat higher for AFDC recipients who had been placed in the reduced-benefit program than in the control group. This could be explained by participants having a greater need for employment income when their benefits are smaller. The average disposable incomes (including wages and benefits) for the reduced-benefit group stayed approximately equal to that of the control group, however, as increases in wages made up for decreases in benefits. This disposable income (for both groups) remained well below the poverty line. A key way the Federal government exerts its influence is by threatening a reduction in funding unless at least 50% of families receiving monthly payments meet work or job training requirements. Specifically, to be counted toward this Work Participation Rate (WPR), parents must perform 30 hours per week (20 for single parents with a child under 6) of work, or work-related activities such as job training, job search assistance, or community service. In 2017, California had a WPR of 61%, thanks mainly to the 52% of recipients of federal money who had un-subsidized employment. The State has responded to accountability to Federal work participation requirements in several ways. Governor Jerry Brown proposed reforms‚Äîenacted in 2012‚Äîto require recipients to be engaged in Federally- approved work activities after the first 24 months of aid (during which time a more flexible set of work activities is available). This change was also intended to decrease the time recipients spend in the program, hence cutting costs at the same time as guarding against a reduction in Federal funding. The State also extends this accountability to the counties through a policy of decreasing funding to counties that don't meet the Federal rate in the event that the State as a whole receives a penalty. The State further requires CalWORKs recipients, along with their caseworker, to construct plans for beginning work-activities as soon as possible.

She was instrumental in establishing nursery playcentres in the early 1940s, which later developed into the present-day playcentre movement. Early life Wood was born Joan Walter in South Weald, Essex, England on 11 January 1909. She grew up in England and South Africa and was Dux of Durban Girls' College in 1926. She then moved to Sydney and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Sydney in 1926. She met and married Fred Wood while in Australia. Wood taught music at a girls' boarding school in Armidale, New South Wales for two years. In 1935 her husband was appointed Professor of History at Victoria University of Wellington and Joan, Fred and their son moved to Wellington. She became friendly with other women married to academic men who had given up their careers and together worked on projects such as the development of the playcentre movement. Public life Wood, together with Beatrice Beeby and Inge Smithells, established nursery playcentres in Wellington, New Zealand in the early 1940s. The aim of the playcentres was to give mothers some relief from single parenting while their husbands were absent fighting in World War II. Two groups were initially established in Karori and Kelburne. On 22 July 1941 an inaugural meeting was held at Joan Wood's home and the thirteen women who attended agreed to establish a playcentre association. Beatrice Beeby was elected first President, Joan Wood Recording Secretary and Inge Smithells Organising Secretary. All three women were anxious to be independent, however they were still able to benefit from the connections of their husbands (all three were married to influential men in the education field). The original two centres established in 1941 were still in operation in 2015. Parent education was needed to help the fledgling organisation thrive, and Wood continued her own education, graduating with a Diploma of Education in 1942. She also lectured on child development at the Wellington WEA. In the 1950s Wood returned to music and studied singing in Paris and London, returning to Wellington to teach singing to private students and at Victoria University.

Kissi penny, also seen transcribed as kissy or kisi penny or known as guenze, koli, and kilindi, was an iron currency made in Sierra Leone that circulated widely in the immediate vicinity of its production among Gbandi (Bandi), Gola, Kissi, Kpelle, Loma, Mandinka and Mende and other people of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea- Conakry. Origin West Africans from the region of modern-day Liberia and Sierra Leone have used iron as a trading good and standard of value for a long time. Iron working had developed in the region by ca. 600 B.C.E. and was of extremely high-quality. Even in the Early modern period, West African iron and steel easily exceeded the quality of European steel. However, the relative lack of fuel available meant that West African iron was expensive compared to European iron. Portuguese records indicated that sailing voyages in the early sixteenth century carried iron bars among the trade good going farther north. During the period of the slave trade in the region, iron bars were a standard of payment and wealth.Facinet Beavogui, \\"Circulation mon√©taire en l'Afrique de l'Ouest: Le cas du guinz√© (Guinƒóe, Liberia),\\" in Yasmine Marzouk, Christian Seignobos, Fran√ßois Sigaut, eds. Outils aratoires en Afrique: innovations, normes et traces. Paris: Karthala, (2000), pp. 175, 178-81. There is no reason to believe that these items were shaped as the kissi penny was. Rather it seems that the currency began being manufactured in the specific form of the kissi penny around 1880. Circulation Thanks to the trading and nautical activities of the people of the region, especially the Kru kissi pennies circulated widely along the coast of West and Central Africa. Historical records do not note the use of this currency before the last years of the nineteenth century (c. 1880) and they continued in use as money until gradually replaced by colonial currencies, but as late as 1940 in Sierra Leone and even as late as the 1980s in Liberia. Production Individual kissi pennies from the Mus√©e des Confluences in France Kissi pennies were made by smiths in the form of long rods, with a \\"T\\" on one end (called nling or \\"ear\\"), and a sort of blade, not unlike a hoe on the other end (called kodo or \\"foot\\"). They ranged in length from about 6 (15 cm) to as long as 16 inches (40 cm). A score of oranges could be bought for two, or a bunch of bananas.Allison Hingston Quiggin, A Survey of Primitive Money: The Beginning of Currency (London: Taylor and Francis, 1949) p. 92 Because each one had relatively small value, they were often gathered into bundles (usually of 20). Prices compiled in the early twentieth century, for example put the cost of a cow at 100 bundles, while bride price might be 200 bundles, and slaves, while the domestic slave trade was still working, might sell for 300 bundles. Religious use Even after they were discontinued for use as currency, kissi pennies continued to be employed in the society of the region, for example, as tokens of completing rituals in the Poro and Sande Societies; as bridewealth,E Doris Earthy, \\"The Social Structure of a Gbande Town,\\" Man 36 (1936): 203 (Earthy calls this money \\"iron bar currency\\"). and also to be placed on tombs and graves, where they were believed to channel the souls of the dead. At some point, the currency acquired spiritual aspects, perhaps because of its use in graves, and as a result, when a penny broke it was considered without value until a Zoe, or religious practitioner, repaired it in a special ceremony. It was this feature that led to it being called \\"money with a soul.\\"\\"Kissi Money or \\"Money with a Soul\\" http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/kissi.htm European travelers regarded them as a curious form of primitive money, and as a result many were collected and deposited in museums. They continue to be sold on art and curio markets, as well as among numismatists to the present day.

Early Life He passed the London General School Examination in 1933 and in 1935 obtained the science qualification necessary for him to enrol at the London Hospital Medical College that October. He qualified with the Conjoint diploma (LRCP London, MRCS England) in 1939. After resident posts in medicine and surgery he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served during the Second World War in North Africa, where he was taken prisoner at the fall of Tobruk. In 1943 he managed to escape from captivity in Italy and after what his BMJ obituarist calls \\"a period of considerable hardship and excitement\\" he reached the allied lines. He was demobilised in 1946 with the rank of captain. Postgraduate Training He passed the University of London's examinations for the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB BS) in 1946 and in 1948 those for Membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London (MRCP) Having taken up psychiatry in 1951, he obtained a Diploma in Psychological Medicine (DPM) in 1952. He was a trainee in the university department in Newcastle-upon-Tyne before moving to the professorial unit of the Maudsley Hospital in London where he came under the influence of Sir Aubrey Lewis. Taking an interest in the continental schools of psychiatry, he worked with Karl Leonhard in East Germany and Christian Astrup in Norway. Fish was appointed assistant psychiatrist at the Carlton Hayes Hospital, Narborough, in 1954 and consultant psychiatrist at St. Nicholas Hospital, Gosforth, in 1955. Academic Work Fish moved to the University of Edinburgh as a senior lecturer in psychological medicine in 1956, and became a member of the Royal College of Physicians there (MRCPE) in 1964. That year he became the first professor of psychiatry at the University of Liverpool. He set up professorial units of psychiatry at Rainhill Hospital and Walton Hospital, Liverpool. Apart from undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and research, and writing several textbooks, his main contribution has been to bring German descriptive psychopathology to the attention of English-speaking psychiatrists, in particular the works of Carl Wernicke, Karl Kleist and Karl Leonhard, which stand apart from the Anglo-American tradition dominated earlier by psychoanalysis and now by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. This serves to balance the earlier uncritical acceptance of psychoanalytic theory. His Clinical Psychopathology: Signs and Symptoms in PsychiatryPatricia R.

Born to Chinese immigrants in Dunedin, he received his education at schools in Hong Kong and Dunedin. He became known in Otago and Southland as a trader, but also as a translator. He permanently moved to Hong Kong at the age of 30, and had a prominent role with many organisations there. He was a member of the Urban Council of Hong Kong on two occasions. Early life He was born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1875 after the arrival of his parents in the country. His father was Forsigh Wong Tape, a merchant from Sunning in the Taishan county, Guangdong province, China, and his mother was Hie Toy. His father was leading a group of Chinese diggers to Otago for prospecting gold. His parents were married by the minister of Knox Church, Donald Stuart, on 20 March 1875. Due to his occupation as a trader, his father travelled frequently between New Zealand and Hong Kong, and Wong Tape often accompanied him. He received his education at Victoria College in Hong Kong and, after his father's death in 1891, at Otago Boys' High School. He lived in Hong Kong from 1894, where he married Emma Kwai-Chun (born 1874), but returned to Dunedin in 1898 without his wife. Wong Tape joined the firm of Hip Fong Tie, importers of Chinese goods and lending agent. Whilst he was often absent due to travel in Southland and Otago, he became well known for his business connections and as an interpreter. Later life in Hong Kong When he left Dunedin for good in 1905, he received testimonials from many of the leading people in Dunedin. He became general manager of an insurance company, a job that he held until his retirement in 1934. He came out of retirement in 1945 to open the firm's Hong Kong office. Wong Tape was a founding member of the Hong Kong chapter of Rotary International, and of the University of Hong Kong. He was appointed onto the Urban Council in 1936 and again in 1949 (he retired in the following year). He was awarded an OBE in 1948. His wife died on 30 June 1953, and Wong Tape died on 16 June 1967.

Van Herpen opened her own label Iris van Herpen in 2007. In 2011, the Dutch designer became a guest-member of the Parisian Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, part of the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de la couture. Since then, Van Herpen has continuously exhibited her new collections at Paris Fashion Week. Van Herpen's work has been included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Career Iris van Herpen graduated from the ArtEZ University of the Arts in Arnhem in 2006 and interned at Alexander McQueen in London, and Claudy Jongstra in Amsterdam before launching her own label in 2007. The Dutch designer debuted her first Couture collection 'Chemical Crows‚Äô, at the 2007 Amsterdam Fashion Week. 3-D printed neckpiece by van Herpen, 2011. Van Herpen designed and shown her first 3D-printed garment at the 2010 Amsterdam Fashion Week. The ‚ÄòCrystallization‚Äô top was inspired from the phase transition water undergoes when it crystallizes. The garment was 3D printed from white polyamide. Van Herpen‚Äôs work can be described as interdisciplinary as she draws inspiration from professions outside of fashion and the arts. Therefore, the designer creates much of her work in collaboration with professionals working in fields of science, technology and architecture. For example, her SS 2020 collection, Sensory Seas', drew inspiration from both marine ecology and the work of Spanish neuroanatomist Ram√≥n y Cajal. In 2010, Iris van Herpen undertook her first collaboration outside of fashion, when she collaborated with the Dutch architectural firm, Benthem Crouwel Architekten to create her ‚ÄòWater‚Äô Dress. Critics describe Iris van Herpen‚Äôs work as both organic and innovative. With New York Times journalist Vanessa Friedman stating: \\"It‚Äôs not that she rejects the heritage of the couture, she just redefines it with modern tools. Once upon a time the sewing machine did the same.‚Äù Van Herpen was one of the first designers to adopt 3D-printing as a garment construction technique. Her design process utilises technologies such as rapid prototyping as one of the guiding principles in her work. Van Herpen is known for using radical materials such as dragon skin, synthetic boat rigging or the whalebones of children‚Äôs umbrellas. Since 2009, pop star Lady Gaga has been wearing Iris van Herpen‚Äôs designs on several occasions. In 2012, Gaga wore a custom shiny black Couture dress for the launch of her perfume Fame. The shape of the perfume bottle served as the inspiration of the dress, which Van Herpen constructed from laser-cut strips of black acrylic. Collaborations Because of van Herpen's multidisciplinary approach to creation, she has collaborated with various artists such as Jolan van der Wiel and Neri Oxman and architects such as Philip Beesley and Benthem and Crouwel Architects. The designer's interest in science and technology has led to ongoing conversations with CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Winkelmann's photographs covered a wide range of topics, but he is best known for his yachting photographs. Early years Henry Winkelmann was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England on 26 September 1860, one of eight children of Peter Winkelmann a stuff and yarn merchant and Louise Sch√ºller. He spent parts of his childhood in nearby Gomersal, Bramley and Manningham. His older brother, Charles, immigrated to New Zealand in 1875, where he became first a schoolteacher then a chemist and later a photographer. In Henry Winkelmann immigrated to New Zealand arriving at Port Chalmers in October 1878 on the sailing ship Calypso.Elliott, Kidd & Wilson. Page 9. As his father had died in 1877, his mother, Louise, and five sisters followed him to New Zealand in the mid 1880s. Jarvis Island By 1881 he was living in Auckland and unemployed. He and Harold Willey Hudson, a fellow boarder at the place he was staying were hired to claim uninhabited Jarvis Island near the equator (valued for its guano), for Thomas Henderson junior partner of Henderson and MacFarlane. Henderson would provide passage and provisions plus a salary, payable upon return of ¬£2 10s for every month spent on the island. They were to stay a minimum of three months, a maximum of five; and they were to resist any attempts at dispossession. They left Auckland aboard the schooner Sunbeam on 8 June 1881. In order to prevent other Auckland business rivals knowing what they were doing, their advertised destination was given as the Kingsmill (Gilbert) Islands. The schooner reached Jarvis Island on 2 August 1881 which dropped them off in August 1881, intending to return at the end of the three- month period necessary to validate their claim. The island was small, consisted mostly of white coral and guano, had no trees and was home to three graves and a number of rundown buildings built by the American Guano Company. They explored the island and removed a foreign flag, finding evidence of a recent caretaker who had left the island because of sickness. A notice stated he would return. Winkelmann and Hudson made their own declaration, signed it and hoisted the British flag. However, when the ship failed to return, the men struggled to survive. They built a still, caught turtles and preserved and ate birds' eggs. They were finally rescued on 23 March 1882 by a ship sent by Henderson, nearly eight months after their arrival on the island. Before leaving the island, the ship tried to load up with guano, but she was unable to safely anchor. A man named Squire Flockton was left behind to retain ownership, together with Hudson's revolver. Several months later, deranged and full of gin, he shot and killed himself. Upon their return to Auckland, Henderson paid them their wages and not a penny more. Bank clerk In 1882 Winkelmann joined the Bank of New Zealand. He worked in branches in New Zealand and Fiji, supplementing his income by teaching the zither and playing in concerts. In 1889 he was transferred to the bank's Sydney branch, returning to Auckland in 1891. Photography In April 1892 Winkelmann purchased a Lancaster Instantograph camera and soon recognising its commercial potential began to supplement his earnings as bank clerk with photography. He created a darkroom in his mother's house in Dock Street (now Huia Street), Devonport. He continued to work at the Bank of New Zealand, which by 1896 had relocated him to Blenheim. He remained there until 1897 when after his mother's death he left the bank and returned to Auckland.Elliott, Kidd & Wilson. Page 12. Back in Auckland he began a customs and indent agency on Queen Street wharf, Auckland working for the steamer SS Kawau. He also sold insurance for the Magdeburg Insurance Company, and acted as a debt collector. All the time he continued to supplement this income with photography. In July 1898 Winkelmann was appointed secretary of the Coastal Steamship Company. He travelled throughout New Zealand, recording sights and scenes through the camera lens. As a result, Winkelmann built up an impressive collection of photographs of many subjects. In 1899 Winkelmann became a member of the Auckland Yacht Club (later the Royal New Zealand Yacht Club). By 1893 his interests in photography and yachting began converging as he was becoming well known for his yachting images. He would often climb the masts while sailing, to take aerial pictures. To assist him in taking better images he purchased a Thornton-Pickard Ruby No.4 half-plate camera and a half plate enlarging lantern from Ross of London. His photographs were by this time being published in New Zealand periodicals and overseas publications, most notably the Auckland Weekly News, due to his friendship with Henry, Robert and Charles Horton, who had an interest in the publication. In 1895 he won the New Zealand Graphic photography competition. In August 1901 Winkelmann set up a photographic studio at 316 Victoria Arcade, at the corner of Shortland and Queen Streets.Elliott, Kidd & Wilson. Page 13. In 1903 he accompanied a New Zealand Parliamentary visit to New Zealand's Pacific islands territories. In 1906 he exhibited at the Christchurch International Exhibition. He was photographer on the 1908 scientific expedition on the Union Streamship ship Taviuni to view the solar eclipse at Flint Island in 1907-1908. This lead him to also accompanying the 1910 scientific expedition on the Talune to the Cook and Society islands. In 1908 he won the Auckland Weekly News photography competition. In 1915 he won the grand prix award at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Decline In late 1913 Winkelmann purchased a farm at Kaukapakapa and he spent much of World War I there, a period that saw him retreat from most social life except for the yachting race days. Retirement Upon his retirement in 1928 Winkelmann sold his collection of Auckland city negatives to the Auckland Public Library.Elliott, Kidd & Wilson. Page 7. He spent his retirement in Swanson where he had purchased land in 1917 and also Ponsonby. He died at Mount Eden on 5 July 1931. In his will he left the balance of his glass-plate negatives to the Auckland Museum. In 1972 his nephew Eric Fox gifted to the Auckland Museum more of Winkelmann's negatives, a large number of lantern slides, two photo albums, as well as a large number of original prints. Personal life Winkelmann never married. Winkelmann was a member of the Canterbury Freehold Land Association, the Victoria Cruising Club, Auckland Yacht Club, the New Zealand Power Boat Association the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts and the Auckland Savage Club.

It was written in response to the publication of an English translation of the Histoire critique due vieux testament by the French cleric Father Richard Simon. Simon's book applied detailed criticism to the textual history of the Bible and argued that, given the compromised nature of much of the Bible, Christians would do better to base their faith on the history and traditions of the Roman Catholic Church. The tendency of Simon's book was to undermine Protestantism, which prioritises the authority of the Bible over the traditions and rituals of the Catholic Church, and so Dryden set out in Religio Laici to address the issues raised by Simon's book, along with other religious issues of his times such as Deism, in order to assert the validity of the teachings of the Church of England.  Sections  Religio Laici consists of 462 lines of consecutive rhyming couplets. Although it is not divided by breaks or headings into parts or sections, Dryden added notes in the margins to indicate the topics and issues addressed in each section of the poem. These are (in the original spelling): * Opinions of the several sects of Philosophers concerning the Summum Bonum * System of Deism * Of Reveal'd Religion * Objection of the Deist * The Objection answer'd * Digression to the Translator of Father Simon's Critical History of the Old Testament * Of the infallibility of Tradition, in General * Objection in behalf of Tradition; urg'd by Father Simon * The Second Objection * Answer to the Objection Excerpt Dryden concludes the poem with a plea for moderation in all things including religious debate. On this subject, more than all others, it behoves each citizen to 'curb' their 'private Reason' (or opinions) rather than disturb 'the publick Peace'. It is notable that the climax of this long series of complex religious arguments is social rather than religious: 'Common quiet is Mankind's concern'.  The Hind and the Panther  Five years after publishing Religio Laici Dryden drastically changed his position and converted to Roman Catholicism. He published a long and complex allegorical poem in three parts, The Hind and the Panther (1687) to explain his conversion. The fact that he converted a few years into the rule of the Catholic king, James II, prompted much scorn and derision from contemporaries.

Hoover (born April 14, 1951) is a Professor of Media Studies and Professor Adjoint of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is the founder and director of the Center for Media, Religion and Culture. His research interest centers on media audience and reception studies rooted in cultural studies, anthropology and qualitative sociology. He is known for his work on media and religion, particularly in the phenomenon of televangelism, and later in religion journalism. His most recent work involves household-level studies of media audience practices of meaning-making and identity. Supported by a series of grants from the Lilly Endowment and the Ford Foundation, this work investigates the extent to which the media sphere as a whole and the various media which comprise it constitute a central site of meaning practice (including religious meaning practice) in contemporary domestic and global life. Through the center he directs, he has also become influential in scholarly discourses about the public understanding and role of religion globally and the ways those are rooted in its mediation.  Biography  Hoover was born in Impirial, Nebraska, but he grew up in Rocky Ford, Colorado. His father, Wilbur R. Hoover, was a Minister at the Church of the Brethren in Rocky Ford, and he was thus raised in a religious environment in a small town of 4,000 people. Under the influence of his father, Hoover developed an interest in media and religion early on his life. Rev. Hoover used to subscribe to a variety of local and national newspapers, including New York Times Sunday and Denver newspapers, and often discussed his insights on media and religion with his family. After high school, Hoover left his hometown to get a B.A in Philosophy and Religion at McPherson College, a liberal arts college founded by the leaders of the Church of the Brethren, in McPherson, Kansas. He graduated in 1973 then he moved to California to pursue an M.A in Ethics from Pacific School of Religion/Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. While he was there, he participated in its Religion and Society Seminar, organized by Robert N. Bellah. During two years of his M.A training, Hoover studied under John Coleman, SJ., Karen Lebacqz, and George Conklin. After he graduated in 1975, he moved to Elgin, Illinois to work as a consultant for Media Education and Advocacy for the Church of Brethren General Board. For four years Hoover and his wife, Karen Woody Hoover, stayed in Elgin where he also did a media reform work and participated in the creation of a nationally known media literacy curriculum, Television Awareness Training. In 1979, Hoover began his studies toward the M.A and PhD degrees in Communications at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania. As a graduate student he worked under George Gerbner (who was Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at that time) on the Cultural Indicators Project Gerbner directed along with Professor Larry Gross. Gerbner later served (along with Carolyn Marvin) on Hoover's dissertation committee, which was chaired by Larry Gross. His dissertation, a qualitative study of the audience for Pat Robertson's 700 Club program, was later published, in revised form, as Mass Media Religion: The Social Sources of the Electric Church (Sage, 1988), in a series edited by Robert White. After he received his Ph.D in 1985, Hoover was hired as an Assistant Professor by School of Communication and Theater, Temple University, Philadelphia. He stayed there for six years, becoming Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in Temple's School of Communication and Theater, before he moved to University of Colorado at Boulder in 1991.  Theoretical contribution  Hoover's scholarly work has built on ‚Äìand expanded‚Äî theoretical convergences between the fields of media studies and religious studies.http://www.patheos.com/blogs/poptheology/2008/03/religion-in-the- media-age-a-review/ In particular, his book Rethinking media, religion and culture (co-authored with Knut Lundby) is a foundational text at the intersection of these two fields.http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39886711 In media studies, he is identified with culturalist and interpretivist turns that have deepened and nuanced prior, more objectivist and quantitative directions, demonstrating that such approaches are essential to understanding the complex and layered phenomena circulating around the idea of \\"the religious.\\" His work on household media use studies have demonstrated helpful directions and results from such approaches to understanding the audience.https://www.jrmdc.com/journal/article/view/93 In the field of religious studies, he has been active in \\"new paradigm\\" religion research which stresses practice over structure or function, opening a wide field of contemporary religious phenomena in media and commodity culture to scholarly view.

Written by co-creator Ian Brennan and directed by Paris Barclay, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on February 7, 2012. It features special guest star Ricky Martin as a night-school Spanish teacher whom Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) introduces to McKinley High, and shows several of McKinley's teachers competing for a promotion when a tenured position unexpectedly becomes available. The episode received mixed to positive reviews, and many critics considered Martin to be a highlight. Reaction to the music as a whole was less enthusiastic than for the episode itself, though \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" were given a generally favorable reception. The former song charted on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Canadian Hot 100; of the remaining four singles, \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and the other three singles did not chart. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.81 million American viewers and received a 3.3/9 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was down significantly from the special tribute episode, \\"Michael\\", which aired the previous week. Plot The retirement of a history teacher opens a tenured position at McKinley High. Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) both want the promotion, but anonymous students have registered complaints about the pair. Determined to polish up his language skills, Will goes to night school for a refresher course and meets instructor David Martinez (Ricky Martin), who points out that kids learn better through music. Will assigns a Spanish-themed week to New Directions and David helps by singing \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" partially in Spanish. Santana (Naya Rivera) suggests that Will now has a rival and needs to defend his honor. Rachel (Lea Michele) tells Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) that she has accepted Finn's (Cory Monteith) marriage proposal. Kurt later tells Finn that he would be lucky to have Rachel some day, but he believes Finn is considering matrimony because he has given up too early on his own dreams. Mercedes is torn between her feelings for Sam (Chord Overstreet) and her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker). Guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) recommends that Mercedes and Sam stop speaking to each other for a week so they can hear what their hearts are telling them. Mercedes sings \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" and Sam reciprocates by singing a mash-up of \\"Bambol√©o\\" and \\"Hero\\". Sue's position as coach of the Cheerios is challenged by the synchronized swim coach, Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes). Roz is also pursuing the tenured position, and she views herself as a serious competitor for tenure and for replacing Sue on the Cheerios. She believes Sue's coaching style and cheerleading choreography is old-fashioned, and plans to update the team if she becomes the new coach. Sue reveals her desire to become a mother and asks Will to be the sperm donor. When Will's fiancee, Emma, confronts her about this request, Sue admits that she wants Will's capacity for kindness for her child. Emma and Will's relationship becomes strained as he focuses on impressing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to win tenure, and denigrates her newest set of counseling pamphlets. He is surprised when Coach Beiste (Dot- Marie Jones) enthusiastically praises Emma for her recent pamphlet on genital sanitation, which has just been adopted by the Big Ten football teams. Santana and David duet with \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and Will responds with a bilingual rendition of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" while dressed as a matador, which offends Santana. Will accuses her of complaining about him, and she says she did so because of the negative Latin stereotypes he has been perpetuating. Sue discovers that Cheerios co-captain Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) was the one who complained about her coaching. Becky believed that Sue had become less focused on the squad, to its detriment, and Sue praises her devotion to the team. Will arranges with Figgins to become the new history teacher, and successfully proposes David to be his replacement as Spanish teacher. Ultimately, Emma is the one who is given tenure. Production Ricky Martin (pictured) sent a tweet about applying to be a Spanish teacher at Glee McKinley High School On November 29, 2011, the day news broke that Ricky Martin had \\"closed a deal\\" with Glee to guest star in an early 2012 episode, Martin himself tweeted, \\"I hear McKinley high has an opening for a Spanish teacher... Maybe I‚Äôll apply. ;o)\\". It was rumoured he would be a recurring character and a romance would begin with recurring character from season 1 April who was rumoured to appear in season 3, but this did not happen. He turned out to be only a guest. The episode was written by co-creator Ian Brennan and directed by Paris Barclay, and began filming on January 5, 2012, with Martin in attendance; he had recorded his songs the day before. He finished filming his scenes that week, ending early in the morning of January 7, 2012. The previous episode‚Äîthe Michael Jackson tribute‚Äîhad not yet completed, and the two episodes continued in parallel until the final Michael Jackson number was shot on January 13, 2012, the same day that the thirteenth episode commenced filming. One of the songs Martin performs is a Spanglish version of LMFAO's \\"Sexy and I Know It\\", as part of a competition with Morrison's character, who sings an Elvis Presley song in Spanish, \\"A Little Less Conversation. Martin's other musical number, Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita\\", is a duet with Rivera. The two remaining numbers performed in the episode include a mash-up of \\"Bamboleo\\" by the Gipsy Kings and \\"Hero\\" by Enrique Iglesias, performed by Overstreet with the other New Directions males, and Gloria Estefan's \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" performed by Riley. The six cover versions have been released as five singles for digital download, with the two-song mash-up in one single. The brief, flashback performance of \\"La Cucaracha\\" was not released as a single. Recurring guest stars who appear in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), synchronized swimming coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes), cheerleading co- captain Becky Jackson (Potter), football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker), football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones) and tenured history teacher Mrs. Hagberg (Mary Gillis). Reception Ratings \\"The Spanish Teacher\\" was first broadcast on February 7, 2012 in the United States on Fox. It received a 3.3/9 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 7.81 million American viewers during its initial airing, a significant decrease from the 3.7/10 rating/share and 9.07 million viewers of the previous episode, the Michael Jackson tribute \\"Michael\\", which was broadcast on January 31, 2012. Viewership also decreased significantly in Canada, where 1.57 million viewers watched the episode on the same day as its American premiere.

Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"much of this episode felt like a very deliberate throwback to season one, in some very good ways\\", and IGN's Robert Canning said that \\"the overarching storylines on Glee have become far more engaging than what we saw in the first half of the season\\". John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode \\"does a lot of things right when it comes to the plot\\", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as \\"consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around\\". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode \\"brought more narrative developments that didn‚Äôt make sense\\", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, \\"the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory\\". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as \\"the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment\\". The introduction of Ricky Martin as David Martinez was welcomed by most reviewers. Futterman wrote that \\"Ricky Martin carried on the Gwyneth Paltrow tradition of pretty great guest teacher cameos\\", and TVLine Michael Slezak said that the episode was good \\"at least whenever Ricky Martin appeared on screen\\". VanDerWerff called him \\"fun and infectious\\", and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide said he \\"showed himself to be a guest star with mucho potential\\". Kubicek, though he said Martin was \\"great at singing\\", found him \\"kind of dull as an actor\\", and Canning said Martin \\"felt out of place\\" in the episode. Reviewers were surprised that Will (Morrison, pictured), a Spanish teacher, \\"hadn't even mastered the basics of the language\\". Although Canning wrote that \\"the writers did a fine job of incorporating the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines\\", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not \\"seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1\\", and Slezak expressed surprise that \\"he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!\\", as did Chaney. Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his \\"La Cucaracha\\" rendition for his class, was \\"suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head\\", and Chaney commented, \\"Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this.\\" VanDerWerff wrote of \\"the weird, dark despair at the heart of Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't know what else to do.\\" He added, \\"I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one.\\" Canning stated that \\"the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change\\", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and \\"celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner\\" with the conclusion, \\"sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode\\". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure \\"when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets\\". The scene between Sue and Roz was singled out by many reviewers. Bell wrote that she was \\"really loving the feisty dynamic\\" between them, and that it was \\"about time that Sue had a proper sparring partner\\". Flandez called Roz \\"the delightfully colorful synchronized swimming teacher\\", and said her \\"scathing remarks were expertly delivered\\" and that there were \\"too many good lines to savor\\". Futterman said Roz reminded her of \\"what an entertaining spitfire Sue was during season one\\", and that Sue is \\"a shadow of [her] former self\\" as evidenced by the fact that Roz has not been a victim of Sue's \\"evil planning\\". Lynch described the encounter as \\"one of the episode highlights\\", though he felt that \\"the writers overdid it a touch\\" when Sue \\"barely got in any retorts\\" against Roz. Reiter called Roz \\"a great addition to the cast of characters\\" and Leakes \\"spot-on\\" in the role, also hearkening back to the early Sue. Kubicek said he \\"might like this subplot\\" if Leakes did not mistake \\"shouting for acting\\", and Slezak commented on Roz's \\"particularly abhorrent assessment of Sue‚Äôs reproductive abilities\\". Votta, however, declared that the show \\"should never let NeNe go\\", and said she \\"delivers some of the best lines ever\\". Chaney and Slezak thought that Sue should have been fired immediately for requesting sperm donations from New Directions males, while Lynch merely deemed it a possible detriment to her tenure bid. Kubicek thought the pregnancy storyline should move forward \\"because Sue becoming a mommy has comedic potential written all over it\\". A \\"highlight\\" for Lynch was the scene where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were watching Twilight together, not only because the \\"friendship between Kurt and Mercedes\\" has been \\"sadly downplayed\\", but because it was \\"nice to see the Glee kids just being kids sometimes\\". The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as \\"one of the truest moments of the season so far\\". Votta wrote, \\"Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception.\\" Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting \\"its scope too wide\\", credited their storyline as the \\"only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song\\". Votta stated that \\"Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner\\", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence \\"helped build their relationship into something we care more about\\". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her \\"to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane\\". Music and performances The musical performances received a mixed response from reviewers. Votta said that \\"the songs were mostly forgettable and generally useless to advancing the plot\\", and Canning maintained that \\"the music this week was just okay\\". Although VanDerWerff called the musical numbers \\"mostly superfluous\\", he described many of them as \\"pretty fun\\", while Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle said he \\"wasn‚Äôt incredibly moved by this week‚Äôs Spanish-flavored selections\\". \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" was reviewed positively by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell, who cited Martin's \\"incredibly sexy performance\\". Slezak gave the number an enthusiastic \\"Oh dear God, please yes\\", \\"bonus points\\" and an \\"A\\" grade. Chaney declared that \\"Martin did what he does very well: dance and sing with high intensity\\", though she wished \\"they had chosen a better song\\" and gave it a the latter sentiment was echoed by Lynch, who called the song \\"idiotic\\" and gave it a slightly lower \\"C+\\". Futterman characterized it as a \\"rousing number that toes the line of being too risque for a high school classroom\\", though Kubicek thought that having \\"a teacher grinding with students\\" was \\"wildly inappropriate\\" if \\"hot and pretty entertaining\\". MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan, however, called it \\"one of the most eye-brow-raising musical numbers\\" in the show's history, \\"bizarre\\", and \\"a Rory-dancing, Finn-flailing fail\\". VanDerWerff was also critical, and described it as \\"dumb and stupid and wrong\\". \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" was the latest \\"really strong\\" number sung by Mercedes (Riley, pictured) in the third season. Slezak stated that \\"Mercedes' musical moments in Season 3 have been really strong\\" and that \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" was \\"no exception\\"; he gave it a \\"B+\\" grade. Lynch gave an and wrote, \\"It's been a treat to hear her develop the softer side of her voice.\\" Chaney said that \\"the number was fine, just not particularly interesting\\" and gave it a \\"C\\", but Futterman declared that Mercedes \\"brings a richness and power and commendable Spanish pronunciation to Gloria Estefan's song\\". Lynch called the \\"Bamboleo\\" / \\"Hero\\" mash-up \\"another Samcedes winner\\" and gave it a \\"B\\", and Chaney said it was a \\"fun choice\\" that \\"would have been a fun number\\" without the \\"constant\\" focus on the hipster boots, and graded it \\"C+\\". Sullivan agreed that the boots were better not seen, but that \\"the song actually worked\\"; he also noted that \\"Sam can sound a hell of a lot like\\" Iglesias. Futterman also heard the resemblance between Sam and Iglesias, though she said \\"the performance lacks the fire and sex appeal of the originals\\". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"the corniest number in several seasons\\". Futterman called \\"La Isla Bonita\\" the \\"best number of the night\\". She added that it \\"mixes slick dance moves and spot-on singing with perhaps a touch too much sexual tension for a student/teacher pairing\\". Slezak said that \\"the harmonies were sweet, and the dancing was sexy without crossing the line into disturbing April‚ÄìOctober territory\\" and gave it an Votta wrote that \\"the pair don't have any chemistry\\", but that \\"they're both very pretty to look at and listen to\\" and \\"their interpretation of Latin culture is modern and sexy\\". Both Chaney and Lynch noted what she called \\"inexplicably high production values\\"; the fact that \\"these two looked great together\\", danced the merengue \\"beautifully\\" and \\"sounded smooth\\" drew a \\"B+\\" grade from her, while his \\"B\\" was given because \\"the dancing wowed but their voices just didn't connect for me on this empty club version\\". The two songs performed by Will Schuester received the most negative reviews. Chaney described \\"La Cucaracha\\" as \\"mercifully brief\\", and Slezak gave it an \\"F\\" for being not only \\"intentionally awful\\" but \\"awful- awful\\". Chaney was more generously inclined toward \\"A Little Less Conversation\\". She wrote, \\"Matthew Morrison managed to give his all to this Spanish-infused Elvis Presley cover, even though he looked pretty ridiculous in that matador outfit\\", and gave it a \\"B\\". Futterman stated that the performance reached \\"a new low\\" with the appearance of \\"Mike and Brittany as his bulls\\", and Lynch said that the number \\"was supposed to suck\\" and \\"did its job well\\"; even so, he gave it a Slezak gave a one-word summation to accompany his \\"D\\" grade: \\"No.\\" Chart history Two of the episode's five released singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" debuted at number eighty-three and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" at number ninety-nine.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" The second of those songs, \\"La Isla Bonita\\", also debuted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 at number ninety-three, and was the one song from the episode to appear on that chart.

A Jacobi ellipsoid is a triaxial (i.e. scalene) ellipsoid under equilibrium which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. It is named after the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. History Before Jacobi, the Maclaurin spheroid, which was formulated in 1742, was considered to be the only type of ellipsoid which can be in equilibrium. Lagrange in 1811Lagrange, J. L. (1811). M√©canique Analytique sect. IV 2 vol. considered the possibility of a tri-axial ellipsoid being in equilibrium, but concluded that the two equatorial axes of the ellipsoid must be equal, leading back to the solution of Maclaurin spheroid. But Jacobi realized that Lagrange's demonstration is a sufficiency condition, but not necessary. He remarked, \\"One would make a grave mistake if one supposed that the spheroids of revolution are the only admissible figures of equilibrium even under the restrictive assumption of second degree surfaces\\" and further adds that \\"In fact a simple consideration shows that ellipsoids with three unequal axes can very well be figures of equilibrium; and that one can assume an ellipse of arbitrary shape for the equatorial section and determine the third axis (which is also the least of the three axes) and the angular velocity of rotation such that the ellipsoid is a figure of equilibrium.\\" Jacobi formula The equatorial (a, b) and polar (c) semi- principal axes of a Jacobi ellipsoid and Maclaurin spheroid, as a function of normalized angular momentum, subject to abc = 1 (i.e. for constant volume of 4œÄ/3). The broken lines are for the Maclaurin spheroid in the range where it has dynamic but not secular stability - it will relax into the Jacobi ellipsoid provided it can dissipate energy by virtue of a viscous constituent fluid. For an ellipsoid with equatorial semi-principal axes a, \\\\ b and polar semi- principal axis c, the angular velocity \\\\Omega about c is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{\\\\pi G\\\\rho} = 2 abc \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{udu}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\\\\Delta}\\\\ , \\\\quad \\\\Delta^2 = (a^2+u)(b^2+u)(c^2+u), where \\\\rho is the density and G is the gravitational constant, subject to the condition :a^2 b^2 \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{du}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\\\\Delta} = c^2\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{du}{(c^2+u)\\\\Delta}. For fixed values of a and b, the above condition has solution for c such that :\\\\frac{1}{c^2}>\\\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\\\frac{1}{b^2}. The integrals can be expressed in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals. In terms of the Carlson symmetric form elliptic integral R_{J}, the formula for the angular velocity becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^{2}}{\\\\pi G \\\\rho} = \\\\frac{4 a b c}{3 (a^{2} - b^{2})} (a^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - b^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2})) and the condition on the relative size of the semi-principal axes a, \\\\ b, \\\\ c is :\\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\frac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2} - a^{2}} (R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2})) = \\\\frac{2}{3} c^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},c^{2}). The angular momentum L of the Jacobi ellipsoid is given by :\\\\frac{L}{\\\\sqrt{GM^3\\\\bar{a}}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt 3}{10}\\\\frac{a^2+b^2}{\\\\bar{a}^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{\\\\pi G\\\\rho}} \\\\ , \\\\quad \\\\bar{a}=(abc)^{1/3}, where M is the mass of the ellipsoid and \\\\bar{a} is the mean radius, the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the ellipsoid. Relationship with Dedekind ellipsoid The Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids are both equilibrium figures for a body of rotating homogeneous self- gravitating fluid. However, while the Jacobi ellipsoid spins bodily, with no internal flow of the fluid in the rotating frame, the Dedekind ellipsoid maintains a fixed orientation, with the constituent fluid circulating within it. This is a direct consequence of Dedekind's theorem. For any given Jacobi ellipsoid, there exists a Dedekind ellipsoid with the same semi-principal axes a, \\\\ b, \\\\ c and same mass and with a flow velocity field of :\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\zeta \\\\frac{- a^{2} y \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} + b^{2} x \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{y}}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}, where x, \\\\ y, \\\\ z are Cartesian coordinates on axes \\\\hat{x}, \\\\ \\\\hat{y}, \\\\ \\\\hat{z} aligned respectively with the a, \\\\ b, \\\\ c axes of the ellipsoid. Here \\\\zeta is the vorticity, which is uniform throughout the spheroid ( abla\\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\zeta \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{z}}). The angular velocity \\\\Omega of the Jacobi ellipsoid and vorticity of the corresponding Dedekind ellipsoid are related by :\\\\zeta = \\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{b} + \\\\frac{b}{a}\\\\right) \\\\Omega. That is, each particle of the fluid of the Dedekind ellipsoid describes a similar elliptical circuit in the same period in which the Jacobi spheroid performs one rotation. In the special case of a = b, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids (and the Maclaurin spheroid) become one and the same; bodily rotation and circular flow amount to the same thing. In this case \\\\zeta = 2 \\\\Omega, as is always true for a rigidly rotating body. In the general case, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids have the same energy, but the angular momentum of the Jacobi spheroid is the greater by a factor of :\\\\frac{L_{\\\\mathrm{Jac}}}{L_{\\\\mathrm{Ded}}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{b} + \\\\frac{b}{a}\\\\right).

Kesterson was next hired as a reporter for the now defunct Henderson Home News, a local community paper, for nearly thirty years before launching a career in politics. She later became the managing editor of the Henderson Home News as well. Kesterson sold the newspaper's articles to larger publications, including the Deseret News and the Las Vegas Sun. She continued to work as a reporter while serving on the Henderson City Council from 1977 to 1985. She retired as managing editor of the Henderson Home News upon her election as Mayor of Henderson in 1985. Political career Kesterson did not enter politics until she was 49 years old. She was appointed to the Henderson City Council in 1975. Kesterson was named as Henderson's woman of the year in 1975, the same year as her appointment. Two years later, in 1977, Keterson won re-election to the Henderson city council, and served on the council until 1981. She remained a newspaper reporter and editor while serving on the council until her retirement from the newspaper in 1985. In 1985, Lorna Kesterson was elected Henderson's first female mayor, becoming the first woman to hold that office. She was re-elected to a second, four-year in term in 1989. Henderson experienced unprecedented population growth during Kesterson's eight-year tenure as mayor, ultimately becoming Nevada's second largest city after Las Vegas. Kesterson and the city council planned the city's new infrastructure, neighborhoods, city parks and recreational facilities to accommodate the needs of the new residents. She left office in 1993. In recognition, Henderson named her the \\"Henderson Woman of Distinction\\" in 1985. In 1991, the state of Nevada named her \\"Nevada Public Official of the Year.\\" Lorna J Kesterson Elementary School, dedicated in her honor in February 2001, and a Henderson recreational area are named for Kesterson. She also served on a number of boards of directors within the Las Vegas Valley, including the Henderson Development Association, the Nevada League of Cities and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. She held a seat on the Clark County Board of Health throughout the 1980s. Death and legacy Lorna Kesterson collapsed and died unexpectedly during a routine visit to her doctor's office on January 16, 2012, at the age of 86. She was survived by her two sons, Don Kesterson of Henderson and Roger Kesterson; seven grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren; and two siblings, Venus Marriages and Donal Jolley. She was predeceased by two sons, Ross Kesterson and Jim Kesterson, and her husband of nearly 40 years, Robert Kesterson. Andy Hafen, Mayor of Henderson from 2009 to 2017, also served in the city council during Kesterson's eight-year tenure as mayor and paid tribute to his predecessor saying, \\"Lorna Kesterson was one of the finest ladies I've had the privilege of working with during my career in public service,\\" said Hafen in a statement. \\"She was a Henderson icon and a pioneer both in politics and in our community.\\" In 2012, the Lorna J. Kesterson Elementary School was named in her honor.

Biography  Born in Socorro, New Mexico, he was the son of Julius Caesar Sanchez and Priscilla Fortune, whose ancestors included the first Spanish colonists in the region, then part of New Spain. As a teenager Sanchez felt a religious calling to the Catholic priesthood and entered the Immaculate Heart Seminary of the Archdiocese to this end, completing his college studies at St. Michael's College, now the Santa Fe University of Art and Design. Showing great promise, he was sent to study theology at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. At the completion of these studies, he was ordained to the priesthood there for the Archdiocese of Santa Fe on 20 December 1959, by the Rector of the College, Archbishop Martin John O'Connor. After his ordination, Sanchez returned to New Mexico. He was then assigned by Archbishop Edwin Byrne to a parish in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He also served in several positions in a local Catholic high school, for which he earned a teaching certificate from the University of New Mexico in 1964. Sanchez earned a degree in canon law as well from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He went on to serve in various positions of leadership in the Archdiocese, including that of Vicar General. Pope Paul VI appointed Sanchez to head the Archdiocese on 1 July 1974. He was the first Hispanic to be named an archbishop of the Catholic Church in the United States. He was consecrated on the 25th of that same month by the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Archbishop Jean Jadot. He was assisted in this by Bishop Patrick Flores of San Antonio, the first Hispanic bishop in the country. The service was attended by 14,000 people. Sanchez became a noted spokesman for the Latino community within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the United States and spoke out often on political issues affecting this population. He established models for outreach to ethnic minorities of use throughout the county. He offered an official apology to the Native Americans of the Southwest for how both his Spanish ancestors and the Catholic Church had treated them. He ordained the first Native American to be named a bishop in the Catholic Church, for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup, Donald Pelotte. Many new pastoral plans to meet the needs of the people of the Southwestern United States were developed by Sanchez to meet the challenges of a new era. He was a leading participant in the Committee of the United States bishops writing a letter on the Hispanic presence in the American Church. Pope John Paul II named him to the Pontifical Commission on Immigration Affairs. He also wrote what was considered to be the most comprehensive Pastoral Letter on HIV/AIDS at that time. In the early 1990s, several women came forth, accusing the archbishop of having been sexually involved with them. Sanchez admitted to the affairs. He was also criticized for alleged failures to act on priests of the Archdiocese who were accused of abusing children. This led him to resign his post on 6 April 1993. Later in 1993, Archbishop Sanchez moved to the midwest and then specifically to Minnesota where he helped on a farm run by the Sisters of Mercy near Jackson, MN.Archbishop Living in Minnesota In 1995, it was reported that he returned to New Mexico to visit family and, in 1997, he led a retreat for priests in Tucson, Arizona.Archbishop Living in Minnesota Later, he moved back to the southwest to live with the retired Friars Minor of the region, not making any public appearances, until 2009 when he was transferred to a facility for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

The building, one of the best examples of its type in San Francisco, is also known as Malloch Apartments, Malloch Apartment Building, and simply by its address: 1360 Montgomery Street. Some have called it the \\"Ocean-Liner House\\", though other Moderne buildings have also been known by that nickname. Designed by Irvin Goldstine for father/son architects John \\"Jack\\" S. Malloch and John Rolph Malloch, the building was used as a filming location in 1947's Dark Passage, a noir work starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Design and construction The building was intended as a home for Jack Malloch and his son, John Rolph Malloch. Both men were partners in a father/son architectural firm based in San Francisco, and both wanted to live on Telegraph Hill with a view of the San Francisco Bay. They determined to build an apartment which would provide them with fine dwellings and also with income from the rental units it held. Irvin Goldstine (sometimes written Irving or Irvine) designed the building for them; he had recently graduated from l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts but had not yet earned his architect's license, so he was not listed as the architect of record. Instead, the Mallochs were listed. Goldstine obtained his license in 1940, four years after he first sketched the Malloch Building. The building site is on a steep hill, so the street-level entrance at the upper edge of the property is not the lowest floor. Four stories of apartments start at the ground floor and go up, and two more floors consisting of a 10-car garage and a sub-basement storage space are below grade, jutting out to the east because of the slope. A manager's apartment was added in 1947 by extending steel beams from the garage and suspending a two- floor unit with steel cables. Structural engineer W.S. Ellison oversaw construction of the primarily wooden frame structure, built atop a foundation and two utility floors made of reinforced concrete to meet exacting state requirements for stability. Open-air lobby showing curved stairs and glass brick Muralist Alfred Du Pont (also known as Dupont) was hired to design images to decorate the exterior. Du Pont produced two high silvery figures in sgraffito, or raised plaster, on the western facade of the building, and a third on the north side. Du Pont applied colored concrete to the exterior and carved it into shape. Flanking the main street entrance are two male figures. The image on the right facing left is a Spanish explorer with a telescope raised to one eye. The image on the left facing right is a bare-chested worker holding a globe, towering above the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, with sleek aircraft flying above and below him, and ships moving in the bay. The actual bridge can be seen from the house; it had been completed the previous year when the Malloch Building was under construction. Around the corner from the main entrance, the third silvery mural shows a robed woman, the spirit of California, standing in front of California represented as a map. The building's elevator was designed and added to the foyer after the building was occupied. It is encased in a backlit glass brick shaft at one edge of the open-air lobby. Scalloped steel railings line the central staircase which is anchored by a glass brick column. Sandblasted designs are featured in glass plate windows above the entrance. The interiors were streamlined as much as possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. Indirect lighting was used throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with indirect lighting and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material. The city of San Francisco notified the Mallochs that they were in violation of a building code prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above the garage. The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the garage. No part of the building was in violation of the code. Use Before the building was completed, it was fully rented. In 1937, the two Malloch men moved into the two penthouse suites in the 12-unit apartment building, collecting rent from the other 10 tenants. The Malloch Building was featured in the 1947 film noir work titled Dark Passage. In the film, Humphrey Bogart, playing an escaped prisoner, is invited by Lauren Bacall into her apartment unit, Number 10 on the third floor of the Malloch Building. In the apartment, Bogart hides out while he heals from plastic surgery, and plots to clear his name. Bogart wearily ascends the nearby Filbert Steps in one scene, on his way to the Malloch Building. Modern-day residents have been known to put a cutout of Bogart in the street-facing window of Number 10.Goldstine, Gary (March 27, 2008). Picasaweb photo album. Owner/occupant John Rolph Malloch died in 1951 at the age of 39. In the early 1980s the building was converted from rental apartments to condominiums. The original plans had been lost to fire, so the renovating architects had to form new plans taken from measurements of the building. A six-page writeup about the building appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed the owners and the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building was thought to be designed by the Mallochs.

It was released in theatres in February 2012, on DVD, February 27, 2012 in UK and March 6, 2012 in US. The film also marks the return of Kelly Sheridan as the voice of Barbie since the first film. Plot A year after the events of the previous film, Merliah Summers is competing in the heats of an invitational surf-meet. Merliah wins first place, narrowly beating her rival, Kylie Morgan, though both ladies get to compete in the finals in Australia. Merliah uses her magical necklace to transform into a mermaid and tell her mother, Queen Calissa, the good news. Calissa is preparing for the Changing of Tides Ceremony to be held at the city of Aquellia deep in the waters of New Zealand, which is performed every twenty years to make the next princess of Oceana an official member of the royal family. Calissa expects Merliah to attend, but the surfing competition is on exactly the same day, causing them to argue, after which they part ways. The next round of heats take place in Australia, and Kylie beats Merliah when she deliberately brushes Merliah's surfboard and causes her to wipe out. Despite Kylie's win, Merliah's handstand maneuver attracts the attention of reporters, and she's approached by Georgie Majors, who asks Merliah to be a spokesperson for Wave Crest surf gear. That night at a luau, Merliah has a photoshoot with Georgie. Kylie is approached by a fish named Alistair who tells her that Merliah has powers that give her an advantage with surfing. Alistair convinces Kylie to steal Merliah's necklace, which Merliah has taken off for the photoshoot because Georgie thinks that it is too distracting. Kylie gets the necklace, and following Alistair's instructions, puts it on and turns into a mermaid. Alistair then lures Kylie underwater to the deep trench where Eris is still trapped in a whirlpool. Snouts, the sea lion, who witnessed Kylie's transformation, secretly follows them. Alistair and Eris trick Kylie into entering the whirlpool, taking Eris' place and freeing her. Snouts returns to the surface to Merliah, who has been searching for her necklace. Even without her necklace, Merliah can still breathe underwater, so she follows Snouts to the trench and frees Kylie from the whirlpool, causing it to destabilize and self-destruct. Kylie is grateful to Merliah and apologizes for stealing her necklace, but when she takes it off to return it, her mermaid tail turns back into legs and Kylie loses the ability to breathe underwater. Merliah quickly hands the necklace back to Kylie to prevent her from drowning. Kylie then promises Merliah to help her stop Eris. Eris and Alistair travel to Aquellia so that Eris can perform the Changing of Tides ceremony herself. Along the way, they meet a group of large, powerful fish called Stargazers. Eris threatens them with her new spell to bring people's worst fears to life, and they agree to follow and obey her. They reach Aquellia while Calissa and the ambassadors of the ocean: Mirabella, Kattrin, Selena, and Renata, are waiting for the midday sun for the ceremony to begin. A fight ensues, and Eris manages to cast her spell on Calissa, whose tail becomes heavy and drags her down to the bottom of the ocean. Eris also casts the spell on all the ambassadors and puts them in a trap. Merliah, Kylie, and Snouts meet up with Zuma and Calissa, and Calissa and Merliah apologize to each other. As Calissa is unable to move because of the spell, Merliah decides to perform the ceremony in her place, accepting that in doing so she will have a tail permanently. Merliah, Kylie, Zuma, and Snouts go to Aquellia, where they manage to get past the Stargazers and free the ambassadors. Merliah manages to get on the throne at the right time, but because she has legs, it doesn't work. Kylie passes the necklace to Merliah in time, and the ceremony is completed, undoing all of Eris's spells and giving Merliah a new tail. Eris tries to stop Merliah by entrapping her in her worst fear, but Merliah blocks the spell and rebounds it back to Eris, giving her legs, her worst fear. The ambassadors then take Eris away to imprison her for good. Merliah, Calissa, and Kylie swim to the surface in time for the surf meet finals. Calissa gives Kylie the magical necklace since she has proven herself in keeping it after helping them. Although Merliah has accepted her duty, she wishes that she could be human again and her legs magically return by themselves. Calissa explains that the ceremony turns whoever does it into their true self, and Merliah's true self is both mermaid and human. Kylie and Merliah join the competition together, but when they surf, Merliah is distracted by her newfound ability to create Merillia when she touches the water. Kylie wins the competition and is offered to become a Wave Crest spokesperson by Georgie. Kylie brings Merliah up on stage, and they hold the trophy together.

It originates in, and is named for, the city and surrounding province of Padua, in the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy. Despite continuing discussion surrounding its true origins, it is recognised in Italy as an indigenous Italian breed.  History  The early history of the Padovana is unclear, and the subject of continuing discussion, as is its relationship to the Polish and the Dutch crested () and Dutch bearded crested () breeds, which are variously considered to have originated in the Netherlands, in Poland, in Russia, or elsewhere. It is often reported that the Padovana was brought from Poland to Italy by the \\"Marquis\\" Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio (1330‚Äì88). However the Dondi who was ennobled was the soldier Francesco Dondi, created Marquis by King John III Sobieski in 1676; no journey to or contact with Poland by Giovanni Dondi in the fourteenth century is documented. Two sources provide evidence of crested chickens in Europe in Roman times: the two marble statuettes of crested chickens observed in the Sala degli Animali of the Vatican Museums in 1927 by Alessandro Ghigi date from the first or second century AD; a chicken skull excavated at West Hill, Uley, in Gloucestershire in England, shows the typical cerebral hernia of the crested breeds and dates from the fourth century. Early iconographic evidence of the breed in Padova is the fresco of the Annunciation by Jacopo da Verona, painted in 1397 in the Oratorio di San Michele in Padova, which shows a peasant woman feeding a crested hen and her chicks. The Padovana is described and illustrated as gallina patavina, or Paduan hen, by Ulisse Aldrovandi in the second part of his work on ornithology, Ornithologiae tomus alter cum indice copiosissimo variarum linguarum, published in Bologna in 1600. In the twenty-first century, breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 1200 for the total breeding stock, of which some 300 were cocks.  Characteristics  Nine colour varieties are recognised for the Padovana, of which six are well-known and documented in older treatises: white, black, silver-laced, gold-laced, buff-laced and \\"sparrowhawk\\". The skin is white and the legs slate-coloured or black. The comb is absent and the wattles vestigial, the ear-lobes are small, whitish and completely covered by the crest. Average weight is for cocks, and for hens.

The center of the family was Drivast, which it ruled holding the titles of Duke and Count. In the late 15th century, a large part of it settled in Venetian territories, primarily Venice itself and Dalmatia. Members of this family lived in a wider region ranging from northern Albania and Montenegro to western Kosovo. History The Spani family was of Albanian origin.; The surname Span or Spani probably derives from the Greek word spanos (beardless). In Croatia and Serbia, the surname is transliterated as Spaniƒá and Spanoviƒá. Serbian historians including J. Erdeljanoviƒá and Petar ≈†obajiƒá linked the surname with the descendants of the Romanized Illyrian population of Montenegro, although that is considered unlikely as the name is neither related to a particular population nor are all its bearers related. As a family with noble status, the Spani first appear in 1304‚Äì1305 as part of the nobility of the Angevin Kingdom of Albania.. The territories the family ruled varied from time to time, but Drivast seems to have been their center.. In the 1380s, the Bal≈°iƒái had taken over Spani territory, along with much of the rest of northern Albania, all the way to Mirdita and Alessio. After Alfonso V (r. 1416‚Äì1458) signed the Treaty of Gaeta with the Albanian leader Skanderbeg in 1451, he signed similar treaties with other chieftains from Albania: Gjergj Arianiti, Gjin Musachia, George Strez Bal≈°iƒá, Peter Spani, Paul Dukagjini, Thopia Musachi, Peter of Himara, Simon Zenevisi and Carlo Tocco who were all, like Skanderbeg, recognized as vassals of the Kingdom of Naples. In the early subdivisions of Albania during the Ottoman era, the region ruled by Pjet√´r Spani was known in Ottoman Turkish as Petrishpani or I-shpani. Of the branches that migrated to Venetian territories, the one in Venice became extinct by the late 16th century, while the Dalmatian branch mainly found in Korƒçula was elevated into the ranks of local nobility. In 1455, during the Ottoman conquest of Novo Brdo, Alessio Spani () was the last Serbian despot's voivode in the town.. Members A branch of the family claimed descent from several imperial Byzantine families. In Gjon Muzaka's 1510 work Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi, Alessio Span is mentioned as a descendant of Emperor Theodosius, although it is unclear to whom it refers as there were three Byzantine emperors named Theodosius. Marin and his descendants At the beginning of the 15th century, most notable members of Span family were Marin and his son Peter.. Peter's father Marin is mentioned in 1409 as already dead.. In 1415, Peter did not have any sons so he decided that he will be inherited by his nephew Marin, a son of his brother Brajko, and ceded several fortresses to him.. When the Venetians recaptured Drivast in 1442, Peter Span lost all of his possessions. Peter's brother, Stefan, was appointed by Venetians as the lord of village Podgora in 1406. After Podgora was given to Hoti, Venetians compensated this lost to Stefan and gave him two small villages (Bistriola and Charochi). When Bal≈°a III died in 1421, Stefan joined Serbian Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá who recognized his rule over three villages in Drivast. Marin Span was commander of Skanderbeg's forces which lost fortress Baleƒç to Venetian forces in 1448 during Skanderbeg's war against Venice. Marin and his soldiers retreated toward Dagnum after being informed by his relative Peter Span about the large Venetian forces heading toward Baleƒç..

Biography Early childhood Kowalski learned how to play the violin at the age of four from his father, who was the conductor in a regimental orchestra. By the age of seven, he had already given many violin recitals in various Polish cities, and was widely considered to be a child prodigy. When he was ten, Kowalski appeared as a soloist with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, performing music by Niccol√≤ Paganini. He began to study music at the Warsaw Conservatory under Professor Joseph Jarzebski‚Äîa former student of the famous Leopold Auer‚Äîand traveled to Paris to continue his studies with violinist Jacques Thibaud. Early career In the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II, Kowalski was noted for his performances with Polskie Radio, the national broadcasting organization. Performances he made on the radio were broadcast live across the country, and reached audiences in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Russia, and Lithuania. He was also engaged in popular music, and composed popular songs. When war finally began in 1939, Kowalski was arrested by Germans in Wƒôgr√≥w while on his way to join his family in Brest-Litovsk. He managed to escape to Brest-Litovsk, which had been occupied by Soviet troops. There he met the great Russian violinist Miron Polyakin, who wrote a letter recommending him as a very talented artist. Polyakin's approval helped his admittance to the Moscow Conservatory, where he continued his studies with Abram Yampolsky, a well-known violin teacher. Hiding Kowalski continued to perform in Soviet-occupied territory, which now included areas of Poland as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. In 1941, Germany launched an invasion of the Soviet Union. At the time, Kowalski was in the city of Lvov with a group of other Polish musicians, and he was again arrested. Members of the Gestapo tortured him in captivity, and he was sentenced to death. While being transported to the place of execution, Kowalski and another inmate attacked their guard and escaped. After wandering for a long time, he found refuge with a family of peasants near Drohobych, now part of modern Ukraine. He spent 20 months hiding during the day in a shelter dug under the peasants' pigsty. After this long period of hiding, he joined a group of Russian partisans, with whom he remained for the rest of the war. Post-war At the end of the war, Kowalski traveled to Vienna, where he again took up a career as a soloist. The Austrian press hailed him as a great violinist. He was admired not only for his virtuosity, but also for his ability to perform two violin concertos in a single performance. He performed mainly with the Viennese Great Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Carl Ettie.For example, \\"Radio Wien (Osterreichische Rundfunkzeitschrift)\\", Heft 8 02/22/1947; Heft 18 05/03/1947; \\"Welt Illustrierte\\" No.9 03/02/1947; \\"Weltpresse\\" (British Zone) No.58 03/12/1947; \\"Wiener Kurier\\" (US Zone) No.60 03/13/1947; \\"Osterreische Zeitung\\" (Soviet Zone) 03/14/1947, 05/07/1947; \\"Die Steffel-Post\\" No.12 Vienna 1947 Before returning to Poland, he embarked on a very successful concert tour in Czechoslovakia, and was compared by his reviewers to the most prominent violinists of the era.\\"Svobodn√© Noviny\\", Brno No.243 10/17/1947, No. 285 12/07/1947; \\"Slovo N√°roda\\", Brno No.293 12/17/1947; \\"N√°≈° Pozhlas\\", Brno No.45 11/9/1947; \\"G≈Ços Ludu\\", Czeski Cieszyn No.131 11/06/1947, No.1 01/01/1948, 01/13/1948; \\"Tep Nov√©ho Zl√≠na\\" 12/02/1947, 12/09/1947; \\"Rovnost\\" No.243 10/17/1947, No.269 11/19/1947, No.293 12/17/1947; \\"Prace\\", Prague No.291 12/14/1947; \\"Cin\\" Brno, No.293 12/17/1947; \\"Narodni Obroda\\" 10/05/1947 When he arrived in Poland once again, his return was heralded by enthusiastic articles in the Polish press.\\"Tydzie≈Ñ\\" No.19 05/16/1948; \\"Radio i ≈öwiat\\" 05/24/1948, No.48 11/29/1953, No.41 10/10/1954, Nos.52-53 on 12/23/1956; \\"S≈Çowo Ludu\\", Kielce No.101 04/28/1952; \\"≈ªycie Radomskie\\" No.99 04/25/1952; \\"≈ªycie Warszawy\\" 05/29/1954, \\"Express Wieczorny\\" No.126 05/28/1954, No.294 12/14/1956; \\"S≈Çowo Powszechne\\" No.131 06/04/1954; \\"G≈Ços Olszty≈Ñski\\" No.215 09/08-09/1956, No.219 09/13/1956; \\"Kurier Szczecinski\\" No.31 02/05-06/1956 He began to perform again for Polskie Radio, and gave many concerts around the country.

There, he worked for the Netherlands Radio Union Orchestra in Hilversum. After this period, he again moved to Israel, but the outbreak and aftermath of the Six-Day War convinced him and his family to emigrate to the United States. In April 1971, he settled down in Providence, Rhode Island, and took up a position at the music department of Brown University as a violin instructor. He and his family received American citizenship on the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the United States, on July 15, 1976. He continued to receive recognition for his talents in America, and on February 6, 1978, he was invited with his wife and other distinguished Americans of Polish descent to the White House by President Jimmy Carter.Rhode Island Herald No.34 10/22/1971, No.39 11/26/1971, No.5 03/31/1972; The Providence Journal 11/10/1973, 11/12/1973; Cranston Herald No.5 04/26/1978 Kowalski died suddenly due to hemorrhage of the upper intestinal tract, at the age of 70, on January 24, 1982, in Providence, Rhode Island. Family During WWII, Kowalski lost almost his entire family. Both of his parents, Abram and Dora, his three sisters, Lonia, Genia, and Danusia, and his brother David were all killed by German soldiers in Brest Litovsk in 1942, when the Jewish ghetto there was liquidated. Only his fourth sister Halina (a renowned cellist) and her two daughters, Lucyna and Henryka survived. Her non-Jewish husband, violinist Henryk Trzonek, was executed by Germans in Warsaw in 1943. Her younger daughter, Henryka Trzonek, is a well- known violinist, and lives in Frankfurt, Germany. She still performs in Germany and abroad. Henryk Kowalski was married to Polish physician Stanislawa Maria Rossa, who was thirteen years his junior. According to his sister Halina, this marriage was the most fortunate event in his life, as it brought him stability, and helped heal many of the wounds left over from the war. He was a devoted father to his two sons, Henryk Mariusz and Michael Adam, and was deeply involved in their musical education. Henryk Mariusz (b. 1956) is a neuroradiologist, who lives and practices in Greenville, NC. He is married to pediatrician Elizabeth Figueroa (b. 1957). They have three sons: Henryk Matthew (b. 1990), Jacob Marek (b. 1996), and Nicholas Andrzej (b. 1996). Michael Adam (b. 1961) is a computer programmer and artist, who lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. He is married to Jane Kowalski (b. 1959), psychotherapist.

The company was formed in 2010 by private equity firm TDR Capital, after it purchased 333 pubs from Mitchells & Butlers. Originally trading from rented offices near Birmingham airport it then moved its operations office to Capability Green in Luton in June 2011 when Stonegate bought the Town & City Pub Company who were in receivership, creating the largest privately held managed pub operator in the UK and acquiring the Yates's and Slug and Lettuce brands in the process.

Synopsis Ivanova documents 10 men from the United States, Canada, France and Sweden as they travel to Odessa, Ukraine, on a romantic tour, arranged by an online dating company AnastasiaDate, to look for possible wives. While there, the men go to several social events, including a beauty pageant at a nightclub, where they meet large numbers of attractive, single women. The interactions at the socials and on the dates the men go on are facilitated by translators. The 84-minute movie is broken into 10 segments or chapters, one for each day of the trip, and each with its own subtitle. It uses a framing device of footage of Michael Lau, a Chinese man living in Richmond, British Columbia, who states he has never had 'real girls' in his life, at the beginning of the film. He says that after 30 years in Canada, he is under family pressure to get married. Other men include Calvin, a Marine veteran; Ramon, a doctor; and Ernie, a man from Minnesota. Except for Lau, the other men who don't reveal their last names, cite bad experiences with women, including divorces, as their motivation for joining AnastasiaDate, an online dating site, and going on the trip. They believe that Ukrainian women have more traditional values when compared to the values of non-Ukrainian women. At the end of the movie, Lau is shown back in his apartment, using his computer to explore the AnastasiaDate.com website after having gone on 10 dates during the trip but failing to find a woman who returns his interest. The film closes with superimposed text that states only one relationship resulted from the trip: one of the interpreters, Lilya, divorced her husband six months after filming, and moved to Minnesota with her daughter to marry Ernie.

The Edo State is also called Benin, though it is not to be confused with the country. The Kingdom of Ugu originated out of Igodomigodo in Nigeria.  Origin  \\"Sometime in the thirteenth century A.D., a period that was probably one of dynastic crisis and transition, The Ogiso dynasty collapsed due partly to internal feuds and the tyranny of Ogiso Owodo. Alongside Igodomigodo polity (later known as Benin) were Udo to the west and Iguobode in Iyekorhionmwon area to the east, and possibly other Edo-speaking polities. What immediately followed the collapse of Ogiso rulership was decentralized political authority. Many autonomous principalities emerged with leaders struggling to establish their own dynastic hegemony over surrounding areas. How long this situation lasted is not clear but oral historical sources and archaeological data soundly indicate that centralized political authority and a new kingship dynasty were re-installed in sections of Benin area during the thirteenth century. The name associated in oral traditions with this period of renewal is Eweka I. Yet, Eweka I's ambition to reunite the polity met with fierce opposition and competing claims. His success was limited as competing polities mushroomed around Benin area. Hence his son or grandson is even credited with establishing another polity known as Ugu in Iyekeorhionmwon, east of Benin and styled himself as Oba n'Ugu or king of Ugu.\\"\\"Precolonial Nigeria: Essays in honor of Toyin Falola\\" Africa World Press. 2005. Retrieved January 20, 2012. The rightful heir and successor to Eweka I, Prince Idu established himself as the king of Ugu after he lost the throne in Benin City due to manipulation orchestrated by the Uzama.  Oral Tradition  The foundation of the Kingdom of Ugu, with its capital at Umoghumwun has been traced to prince (sic) Idu, the eldest son of Oba Eweka I.[\\"Evolution of Benin chieftaincy titles (pages 124-125)\\".] Eweka, E. B. The Uzama who regulated and influenced succession to the throne did not accept Prince Idu as successor to the throne but favoured his younger brother Prince Uwakhuahen. The Uzama conspired and requested Prince Idu 'to provide a cow with a bird's nest built upon its head for the purpose of their father's royal funeral ceremonies.' The Prince was persuaded to go to Umoghunmwun, his mother's village to procure the cow. Meanwhile, 'his rival brother remained in Benin where a cow was procured and a bird's nest planted upon its horn', and 'the cow was then presented before the elders who immediately declared Uwakhuahen successor to the throne.' After Uwakhuahen was crowned Oba, Prince Idu protested vigorously the attitude of the Benin elders towards him, and threatened to declare war. He had the sympathy of his mother's people and most elders in Iyehorhionmwon, who also vowed to go to war to avenge the injustice. Benin elders were panic- struck, and 'to appease Prince Idu, the kingdom was divided.'[\\"Evolution of Benin chieftaincy titles (pages 124)\\".] Eweka, E. B. The whole of south east was ceded to him. This was how the kingdom of Ugu was founded. Because the people were very warlike, the kingdom of Ugu rivalled Benin.  Modern Period  The Kingdom of Ugu still exists today and is still considered a kingdom in its own right. Descendants of the Ugu kingdom live in parts of Nigeria, Europe and the United States.

Stage, also known as William Stage (born June 30, 1951) is an American journalist, author, and photographer, with a focus on the area and history of the American Midwest and St. Louis, Missouri. From 1982-2004 he worked for the weekly newspaper The Riverfront Times, producing three columns, with the best known being Street Talk, where over the years he photographed and interviewed more than 8,500 random individuals about miscellaneous topics. He is also known for his documentary work on a special kind of historical outdoor advertising: vintage brick wall signs. As of 2016, he has authored 11 books, a combination of photography, non-fiction, and fiction, including Ghost Signs: Brick Wall Signs in America (1989), Mound City Chronicles (1991), and Litchfield: A Strange and Twisted Saga of Murder in the Midwest (1998). His photographs have appeared in multiple works, including the cover photograph on the Oxford University Press book, For the Common Good (2002). In 2001, Stage, who had been adopted as an infant, tracked down his biological family, a search which led to a Canadian television documentary and formed the basis for his 2009 memoir Fool for Life. In 2007, Stage was a guest commentator on the St. Louis NPR affiliate, KWMU-FM. Stage also defeated the dreaded cinder beast of Yhar using an enchanted broadsword. Said broadsword was called Ghirahem, and when wielded told jokes. When Sir stage approached the dreaded beast for battle, the defiler cackled, and Stage drew his sword. Ghirahem told an inappropriate joke about goblins breastfeeding, and this confused the beast. While pondering this strange sword, Wm. Stage swung with all his might, and the dreaded beast from Yhar was decapitated. To this Stage keeps the head of that foe mounted above his fireplace, gazing at it, and longing to return to the days when he slew many terrors. Early life Wm. Stage was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and immediately given up for adoption by his 19-year-old unwed mother. For three months he lived under the care of Catholic sisters in the St. Agnes Foundling Home, also in Kalamazoo, until he was adopted and taken to Grand Rapids, becoming the only child of Bill and Virginia Stage. The Inverness [Nova Scotia] Oran - August 25, 2004 - \\"American man finds new friends and family in Inverness County¬Å\\" As a boy, he took a keen interest in zoology and botany, roaming the woods and farmlands near his home. In 1969, he graduated from Catholic Central High School, and two weeks after his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to Germany as a medic / ambulance driver. It was there he attended the University of Maryland Evening Division, studying English composition and German language. After the Army, he began natural history studies at Thomas Jefferson College, the now-defunct \\"hippie college,\\" located on the campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan; he graduated four years later with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree [B Ph]. Epidemiologist In 1978, at the age of 26, while working as an ambulance driver in Grand Rapids, he was recruited by Atlanta's Centers For Disease Control and assigned to the St. Louis City Health Department as a public health officer / STD epidemiologist. He was charged with interviewing those infected with STDs, primarily gonorrhea and syphilis, identifying others that they had been in contact with, and ensuring that all were properly treated. His work involved identifying which diseases were in the population, and when/if other new diseases were appearing. It was during this period, the early 1980s, when HIV/AIDS first appeared, so Stage and his colleagues saw from a clinical perspective the damage done by this disease. This exposure became the basis for his 2015 novel, Creatures on Display. Writing and publishing Stage began his journalist work in college, where as part of a work-study program, he wrote for the City of Grand Rapids Newsletter. After his move to St. Louis to work as a public health office, he began freelancing as a feature writer for local newspapers and magazines. In 1982, when his medical supervisors wanted to transfer Stage to work at a federal penitentiary, he left his position with the CDC to devote himself to journalism and photography. by July 1982, Stage had been hired full-time with The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis-based alternative newsweekly which was founded by Ray Hartmann in 1977. He stayed with the paper until 2004, producing three different regular columns over a 22-year period, plus numerous magazine-style features. Have A Weird Day: Reflections and Ruminations on the St. Louis Experience, is a collection of expository writings that appeared in The Riverfront Times under a column titled \\"Mississippi Mud.\\" From 2003 to 2013, he was a columnist with the St. Charles County [MO] Business Record. He has taught feature writing at the Defense Information School, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana; and photojournalism at Saint Louis University School for Professional Studies. He is a 1995 alumnus of the week-long Missouri Photo Workshop, offered since 1949 by the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Journalism and held in a different Missouri town each year. For three years [2005-2008] Stage and his pre-teen daughter Margaret E. Stage produced a monthly for-profit newspaper, Black White & Read All Over, which they distributed in the Lafayette Square neighborhood of St. Louis.Suburban Journal ¬Å- September 13, 2006 - Neighborhood Paper Chronicles Lafayette Square¬ÅThe [Washington] Missourian ‚Äì June 15, 2011 'Painted Ad' Authors to Hold Booksigning Here In 2010, father and daughter collaborated again with the publication of The Painted Ad: A Postcard Book of Vintage Brick Wall Signs. This work followed the lead of his first book, Ghost Signs: Brick Wall Signs in America, which was the first commercially produced and distributed book on the subject. The authorship of Ghost Signs earned Stage a seat on the board of The Society For Commercial Archeology, at the time based in the Smithsonian Institution and later based in Madison, Wisconsin. Stage founded two publishing companies. Cumquat Publishing Company,The St. Louis Post-Dispatch Sunday Magazine - September 28, 1986 St. Louis in Postcards which wholesales art and novelty postcards to bookstores and museum gift shops, while Floppinfish Publishing Company Ltd. is a small-scale book publisher. In 2001, at the age of 50, Stage found his natural family, first making contact with his biological mother and her children, and later making contact with the children of his late biological father. His lifelong identity as an only child was suddenly altered; he now had a \\"new family,\\" a second set of relatives including a mother, seven half-brothers and sisters as well as numerous aunts and cousins scattered throughout the eastern United States and Nova Scotia. In 2004, Stage was the subject of an episode of \\"Past Lives,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch - March 5, 2004 - Deb Peterson column a documentary-style show on Canadian TV that focuses on people in search of their roots. The half- hour program, filmed on Cape Breton Island, ran Canada-wide and was seen in re-runs for four years. These events were humorously chronicled in a December 2003 cover story in The Riverfront Times and formed the core of Stage's comic memoir Fool For Life. Five years in the writing, Fool was well received by both the reading public and critics alike and bolstered Stage's reputation as a prose humorist.The Columbia [MO] Daily Tribune - May 3, 2009 - \\"You're Served By A Hilarious New Memoir\\"The Inverness [Nova Scotia] Oran - March 11, 2009 - \\"Fool For Life is a great read with Cape Breton Connections\\"St. Louis Beacon - January 30, 2009 - \\"Review: 'Fool For Life' moves quickly\\" In 2007, Stage began voicing guest commentaries on KWMU-FM, the NPR affiliate in St. Louis. Topics ranged from the folly of Daylight Saving Time to the joys of ice skating. In 2010, Stage's prose turned from creating nonfiction to fiction. He published a collection of short stories, Not Waving Drowning (2011), and then Creatures on Display (2015), his first full-length novel, based on his experience as an STD epidemiologist during his years of working for the CDC. Photography As of 2016, Stage has authored four books on photography, largely falling into the genre of street photography. While doing a popular column for The Riverfront Times, \\"Street Talk,\\" Stage posed quirky or philosophical man-on-the-street questions to unwitting subjects, of whom he also obtained a photo. Overall, he captured more than 8,500 faces on film, featuring people from every walk of life, including celebrities and notables such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Dick Gregory, Jimmy Carter, Kurt Vonnegut, Ken Kesey, Queen Ida, Sir Edmund Hillary, and Jerry Seinfeld. A select collection of those portraits became a book, Pictures of People. Some of his photos have been widely exhibited and purchased for inclusion in various private collections. Starting in the mid-1970s, Stage began documenting a bygone form of advertising where signs were painted on walls of brick buildings, and then faded over the years. Some of these wall signs, dating back to the 1800s, have become known as ghost signs. In 1989, he published a book of his photographs, Ghost Signs: Brick Wall Signs in America, then in 2011 The Painted Ad: A Postcard Book of Vintage Brick Wall Signs, and in 2013 under The History Press, Fading Ads of St. Louis, a collection of vintage advertisements found on brick buildings around St. Louis. In 2014, a major exposition of his 36 years of work in photography, Pictures of People, was presented at the Sheldon Concert Hall & Art Galleries in St. Louis. Personal Wm. Stage lives in St. Louis with his wife, Mary, and their six daughters.

Personal life Murphy is a resident of the Sacred Heart neighborhood, and a fifth-generation Lowell resident. The youngest son of longtime Lowell teachers Joan and Dan Murphy, Patrick was born eight minutes behind his twin brother Daniel and four years after his sister Gr√°inne. Like his brother and sister, Patrick graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover on a four-year scholarship, and has continued his education at Tufts University. He works throughout the Merrimack Valley as an independent brick- and stonemason with his cousin. Running for Congress *See Massachusetts's 5th congressional district special election, 2007 On June 2, 2007, Murphy announced he was running as an independent in the special election to fill the seat formerly held by Marty Meehan, who resigned to take the position of Chancellor at UMass Lowell. On October 16, 2007, Murphy placed third out of five candidates, receiving 2,170 votes or 2.05%, finishing behind the major party nominees, Democrat Niki Tsongas and Republican Jim Ogonowski. Lowell City Council On July 1, 2009, Murphy returned to politics, announcing his first candidacy for the Lowell City Council. As in his Congressional run, Murphy promised not to raise campaign money and suggested that anyone wishing to donate to his campaign could contribute instead to one of many local organizations that could be found on his website. In November 2009, Murphy placed eighth among the twenty-one candidates vying for nine seats. Mayor of Lowell In 2011, Murphy ran for reelection. He finished fourth of seventeen candidates, earning another term on the Lowell City Council.http://www.lowellma.gov/depts/electioncensus/election- results/11-8-11%20ELEC%20RESULTS.pdf On January 3, 2012, the City Council voted 5 to 4 to name Murphy Mayor of Lowell. At 29, he was youngest Mayor in Lowell history. Legislative accomplishments Murphy introduced a motion requesting that the city look into implementing a variant of the data-tracking and management tool CitiStat. The motion was approved unanimously. The LowellSTAT program was implemented in 2010. As of June 30, 2013 the program has achieved a net savings of $1,393,363.51. Murphy championed the push for Lowell to become more environmentally friendly. On May 25, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick announced that Lowell would become one of the state's 35 \\"Green Communities\\", which made the city eligible for clean-energy grants and additional federal funds. In 2010, Murphy introduced a motion that expanded the eligibility requirements for the city's homebuyer program to allow veterans who are not first-time homebuyers to receive assistance purchasing a home. City officials expanded the program in July 2011 for fiscal year 2012. Murphy also started an initiative to erect new bus shelters across the city, urged the City Manager to launch a prescription-drug discount program for Lowell residents, and requested that the city invest more of its money in local banks. Controversies During the 2013 Lowell St. Patrick's Day breakfast, Murphy was criticized for making jokes about his colleagues that were considered to be \\"too personal\\". He also upset leaders of the city's Greek community by using a bust of Pericles as a prop during his performance. On March 26, 2013, City Councilor Rita Mercier announced that she planned to file a motion of no confidence against Murphy. According to City Councilor Rodney Elliott, who had lost to Murphy in the 2012 Mayoral vote, Murphy's removal was sought because she felt that his attitude towards the other councilors was antagonistic and questioned his commitment to serve. On April 2, 2013, in the face of public support for Murphy by over a dozen registered speakers, the council voted 8 to 0 on a compromise proposal that tasked Murphy with meeting with the city's Greek community to apologize for his actions instead of pursuing the no-confidence vote.http://www.lowellsun.com/local/ci_22932485/council-mayor-apologize References External links * Official City of Lowell bio * Official Campaign Website Category:Mayors of Lowell, Massachusetts Category:Lowell, Massachusetts City Council members Category:Phillips Academy alumni Category:Tufts University alumni Category:Living people Category:1982 births Category:Massachusetts Independents Category:Politicians from Lowell, Massachusetts ","title":"Patrick O.

This enzyme is mainly located within the lysosome, where it cleaves sphingomyelin to ceramide and sphingosine, the latter of which is then phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate. These metabolites, and subsequent inhibition of the enzyme, influence the balance between cell death (apoptosis) and cell growth (proliferation). A lack of regulation of this sensitive equilibrium can lead to serious clinical consequences.  Mechanism of action of FIASMAs  FIASMAs inhibit the ASM via an indirect, functional mechanism. They insert into the inner leaf of the lysosomal membrane and subsequently cause membrane-associated enzymes, such as ASM, to detach. Upon detachment from the membrane, these enzymes are cleaved and degraded within lysosomes. Inhibition of ASM by certain drugs has been known about for a long time, but systematic studies which characterize the pharmacological group of FIASMAs are relatively recent. ASM is not completely inhibited by FIASMAs and a low residual activity remains, allowing sufficient metabolism for cellular survival to occur. Application of FIASMAs therefore do not result in a clinical condition like Niemann-Pick disease, where ASM-activity is completely lacking because of genetic mutations. In contrast to FIASMAs, a screen of over 346,000 small molecules found only 20 that where direct inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase. These 20 included amiodarone and etidronic acid.Inhibitors of Secretory Acid Sphingomyelinase (S-ASM): qHTS https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=504937  Properties of FIASMAs  FIASMAs are structurally diverse, but have common physicochemical properties. All hitherto identified FIASMAs share a basic nitrogen atom and lipophilic part, which characterizes them as ‚Äúcationic amphiphilic drugs‚Äù. Additionally, they also violate Lipinski's Rule of Five more often than non- FIASMAs. Still they are highly bioavailable and reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. In general, they also show high blood‚Äìbrain barrier permeability. Ceramide and sphingomyelin are important in some clinical disease: * In patients suffering with Major depressive disorder elevated ASM activity has been observed. * In cystic fibrosis, accumulation of ceramide can be lowered using FIASMAs such as amitriptyline.  Known drugs acting as FIASMAs  Cell culture-based experiments identified the listed compounds as FIASMAs (antidepressants are in boldface). These experiments used the human cell line H4. The ASM activity was measured using a radiolabel assay. In case of absent experimental data a chemoinformatic prediction system has been proposed, which enables identification of FIASMAs based on molecular properties.

Zion is within the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, and is one of the oldest churches in Queens, standing at the top of the hill overlooking Douglaston and Little Neck. History Wynant Van Zandt donated land for the building of a church in what was then known as Little Neck, New York, and the cornerstone was laid in 1829. The church opened for worship in 1830. A fire destroyed the original church building in 1924, and Zion was rebuilt and was ready for the Christmas 1925 service. The church building (designed by Aubrey B. Grantham) the extensive grounds including a cemetery, and the 1890 rectory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as contributing buildings and sites within the Douglaston Hill Historic District. In the late 1860s, bandits harassed the communities on the north shore of Long Island, and when one gang leader, Jefferson Knight (who had worked as a coachman for the Rev. Beare), was captured in 1869, he led authorities to the \\"secret bunker\\" where his booty was hidden: the Zion Church belfry. Among the colorful characters who were members of the church were Bloodgood Cutter and the family of Thomas Merton.; Dave Kansas, \\"Zion Episcopal Church Keeping the Faith Intact for 161 Years: Before Cars, or Radios, or the 20th Century, There was the 'White Church on the Hill,'\\" Newsday (Queens ed.), Mar. 17, 1991. Merton, whose father had once been the organist at Zion and who later converted to Catholicism, made some unflattering comments about Zion and Protestants in his book, The Seven Storey Mountain. The church has held a Strawberry Festival every year since its founding in 1830. The event serves as both a fundraiser and an important outreach event to the wider community. Since 1998, Zion has presented the Van Zandt Award to a local person for outstanding community service; the event is usually held at the Douglaston Club. Every October, the church holds a special outdoor (weather permitting) St. Francis \\"blessing of the animals\\" service, where many pets are brought to Zion from both parishioners and non- parishioners. Many community organizations, self-help groups, and 12-step groups meet at the church, including AA, the Douglaston Community Theater, and the Great Commission Church of New York, a Korean congregation. When Northern Boulevard (Route 25A) was being widened and straightened in the early 1930s, the graves of numerous Matinecoc Indians were disturbed. The remains were re- buried in the churchyard of Zion Church in 1931 beneath a monument consisting of a tree growing between a large boulder that had been split in half. The inscription reads: \\"Here rest the last of the Matinecoc.\\" Among the Civil War veterans buried in the Zion Churchyard is Sergeant John H. Starkins, who was awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor for his valiant service against Confederate forces at Campbell Station, Tennessee, on November 16, 1863. Zion Church adopted a mission statement that reads in part: \\"Zion Parish is inclusive not exclusive. We call everyone to follow Christ. We respect each other and have no second-class members.\\"A History of Zion Episcopal Church, booklet produced in celebration of the 175th anniversary of Zion Church in 2005.

The concept of soft support is one that is used to discredit any recorded measures of support for a candidate, including preference polls, campaign infrastructure, media and fundraising strength, which may or may not be reflected in an election by hard votes.The Green Papers Election 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 Glossary The term soft supporter, also known as a swing voter, refers to a person who states support for a candidate but is likely to change their mind. The reasons for a candidate's support to be called \\"soft\\" is due to many factors. In general, voters are not equally engaged or interested in politics or an election and do not share the same exposure to information or political advertising; even many well-engaged voters change their preference for a candidate or remain undecided during a race. No voter commitment exists for any candidate on a ballot; voters are free to change their minds and may develop their voting decisions up to and including on election day.MinnPost - Poll: Romney holds large, but soft, lead in New Hampshire In opinion polling, voters are frequently asked for their choice from among a list of candidates; a candidate who is not listed as a choice may be less likely to receive unprompted support during a political poll, and methods of push polling can persuade a voter towards choosing a certain candidate from a list. Surveys and opinion polling is made less reliable by social desirability bias, whereby respondents will report answers in public that may not share their personal views if they believe they are in the minority. Voters are also subject to stating support for candidates that are well-known and recognizable, although they may not have the enthusiasm and commitment to the candidate necessary to generate a vote. Ronald Reagan was noted as having soft support because his 1980 presidential campaign enjoyed leads in opinion polling because he was a famous actor; his campaigning during the early months was casual and infrequent, and was vulnerable to a more aggressive candidate.Middlesboro Daily News - Google News Archive Search During the 1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Walter Mondale had notoriously soft support among voters, and his opponents Reubin Askew and Gary Hart scored several upset victories over him despite political polling showing Mondale as a definite frontrunner.The Telegraph - Google News Archive SearchLakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search At one point in the campaign Askew told reporters, \\"The support Mondale has in Florida and frankly throughout the nation is still very soft.

Early life Williams was born in London, England in 1837, the eldest son of the late Joshua Williams, Q.C., author of treatises on the law relating to real and personal property and other works, by his marriage with Lucy, daughter of William Strange, of Upton. Williams was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. (Chancellor's Medallist for legal studies, first class law tripos, third class mathematical tripos) in 1859, M.A. in 1862, and LL.M. in 1870. Williams entered at Lincoln's Inn in January 1857, and was called to the English Bar in November 1859. New Zealand He arrived in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1861 on the Derwentwater, moved to Christchurch almost immediately, and in the following year went into partnership with Thomas Smith Duncan, then provincial solicitor, an office which he himself subsequently held for several years. Williams sat in the Canterbury Provincial Council representing the Heathcote electorate in 1862 and 1863 and from 1866 to 1871. He was on the provincial executive council in 1863, in 1866, and in 1867‚Äì1868. On 9 July 1873 at the first meeting of the Board of Governors of the Canterbury College, he was voted chairman after Charles Bowen had declined the role in advance of the meeting. Williams held the chairmanship until 1875, when he moved to Otago. In January 1871 he gave up practice and was land registrar of the Canterbury district until 1872 and Registrar-General of Land for the whole of New Zealand from the latter year until 1875, in which year he was appointed puisne judge for Otago. He was created a knight bachelor in 1911.

They are an important breeding spot for seabirds, especially penguins and albatrosses, and for fur seals. The islands are free of introduced species and are thus covered in dense subantarctic vegetation up to about 200 m. Human visitors are rare.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: √éles Nuageuses and √éle Clugny. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-01-20. Geography The group is located in the northwestern area of the archipelago. It lies about north-west, across the Jean-Baptiste Charcot Channel, from the tip of the Loranchet Peninsula, the northernmost extension of Grande Terre, the principal island of the Kerguelens. The islands are of volcanic origin. The main islands of the Nuageuses are √éle de Cro√ø, √éle du Roland, √éle d‚ÄôApr√®s and the √éles Ternay, with the small √éle Clugny some to the south of the others. Far to the north lies the √élot du Rendez-vous. The highest point in the group is just over 500 m above sea level and the coastlines are mainly sheer cliffs. There is one lake on the archipelago, Lac Claudine, measuring 400 sq m. History The √Æles Nuageuses were first sighted during Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr√©marec's second expedition in 1773. They were so named after the frequently mist-covered tops of their cliffs and were referred to as the Cloudy Isles by James Cook in 1776.Toponymie des Terres australes, Commission territoriale de toponymie avec le concours de Gracie Delepine, ao√ªt 1973 Important Bird Area The √éles Nuageuses, including √éle Clugny, have been identified as a 240 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. At least 25 bird species breed on the islands. Penguins include 7500 pairs of gentoos, 35,000 pairs of northern rockhoppers and up to 50,000 pairs of macaronis. There are 1800 pairs of black-browed, 7800 pairs of grey-headed, 50 pairs of Indian yellow-nosed, about five pairs of wandering and some light-mantled albatrosses. Other birds breeding on the islands include Antarctic prions, Kerguelen, white-chinned, Wilson's storm and common diving petrels, as well as black-faced sheathbills. There are also small numbers of northern giant petrels, Kerguelen shags, Eaton's pintails and Kerguelen terns.

Similar protests affecting wider areas of Italy broke out in December 2013.BBC News The code name of the blockade refers to the Sicilian Vespers, the successful thirteenth-century rebellion against Angevin rule.  Organizers  Shock Force (in Italian Comitato Forza d'Urto) is a Sicilian political grouping, which organized Operation Sicilian Vespers, the 5-day blockade of roads and seaports that brought Sicily and its economy to a standstill in January 2012. Under the Shock Force umbrella other organisations are also represented, such as the Pitchforks Movement (in Italian Movimento dei Forconi), an informal grouping of farmers, shepherds and breeders, and the Sicilian Trucking Association (in Italian Associazione Imprese Autotrasportatori Siciliani, AIAS), an association representing truck drivers and small logistics business interests. The founder of the Pitchforks movement was Martino Morsello, a 57 y.o. former Socialist councillor of Marsala. From the very first day, the blockade was strengthened and widely supported by workers and small businesses in other sectors, such as the fishing industry, the building industry and also by Sicilian students. The Pitchforks Movement presents itself as \\"non-political\\" and \\"against party politics.\\" Unusually, the protest was joined by members of both far-right and far-left political organisations.  Reasons  The events are generally linked with the European sovereign debt crisis and the ongoing world economic crisis, but the last straw that precipitated the blockade and its widespread support were the excessively steep rise in fuel costs experienced in the weeks immediately following the increase in excise duty on fuel, which had been decided upon by the technocratic cabinet of the Prime Minister of Italy Mario Monti.  Blockade events  The blockade started on 16 January, when roads, motorways and the gates of the major ports all around Sicily were blocked. A strategic target for the protesters were Sicilian refineries, which are responsible for 42% of Italian fuel production. A fuel shortage on the island soon followed. On 16 January 2012, the Pitchforks Movement joined Operation Sicilian Vespers, which, while blockading most of the main roads and seaports of the island, led to the suspension of most economic activities in Sicily. There are reports of the blockade gaining a foothold in mainland Italy, in Calabria and even as far north as Pescara. The blockade is having a negative impact also for the economy of the neighboring Malta. The other main association involved in the blockade, the Sicilian Trucking Association (in Italian Associazione Imprese Autotrasportatori Siciliani, AIAS) must suspend the blockade after the fifth day, January 21, as per the Italian law, but the Pitchforks Movement, as other members of the Shock Force, may decide to continue indefinitely. Accidents *On January 17, in Lentini a protester was slightly injured in the face by a small truck driver who was not joining the blockade. *On January 19, near Catenanuova, one protester was left with his foot stuck under the wheel of a truck that had tried to break the blockade. Allegations about links with the far right and the Sicilian autonomists  While the Pitchforks Movement has declared itself apolitical and politically agnostic, there have been allegations it has as a closer relationship with the far-right party Forza Nuova, or with the Movement for Autonomies, the party of the Sicilian head of government, Raffaele Lombardo. However, also organisations close to the far left have joined the operation Sicilian Vespers protests.

It was commissioned by the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain, and first performed by them at City Hall, Salisbury in April 1990.\\" The work was composed during the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. Wilby saw the Book of Revelation as forcefully reflecting the turbulence and optimism of contemporary political events. The title of the work is thus derived from Revelation 21:1-2, which is quoted at the top of the score:\\" :And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. : :And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. Wilby saw his work as representing \\"a sure triumph of the human spirit over oppression, a sense of liberty and resurrection drawn out of sorrow and pain\\". The off-stage solo cornet fanfares and the dynamic nature of the composition as a whole are designed to convey this sentiment.\\" Contest version The original version of The New Jerusalem was for a large group of players. Wilby revised the work for a conventional number of brass band musicians and this version was used as the contest piece for the final of the 1992 National Brass Band Championship of Great Britain.

Design and development In 1967 Fairchild-Hiller sought to develop their own regional jet, the FH-327. Fairchild elected to leverage their relationship with Fokker aircraft in building F.27 aircraft, with a similar arrangement. The plan was to purchase sub-assemblies for the then new F.28 regional jet and assemble them in America into a shortened configuration aircraft with different engines. The Fairchild 228 was to be a 50-passenger twin-engine turbofan regional aircraft. The engines were mounted on the rear of the fuselage, with a swept T-tail arrangement. The wings were equipped with triple-slotted flaps for short-field operations. A new thrust Rolls-Royce RB.203 Trent turbofan was selected to power the aircraft. Fairchild estimated orders of 260-460 aircraft for the US market and 600-800 Internationally. The first sub-assemblies were shipped to Hagerstown, Maryland in 1967 with two prototype aircraft assembled for testing. The first order was placed by West Coast Airlines of Seattle, Washington. Tests of the F.28 aircraft's short field performance was better than expected with simpler flap construction. The Trent engines performance uncertainty and delayed certification of the 228 compared to the F.28 led to the 1968 announcement that the project would be halted. Fairchild wrote off nearly $30 million in expenses in 1968 relating to canceling the F-228 program. The losses contributed to Fairchild's canceled plan to acquire Douglas aircraft. The tail sections were shipped back to Fokker and used in production F.28 aircraft.

As a junior officer he served with Montgomerie's Highlanders (77th Regiment of Foot) in the French and Indian War in North America, primarily in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. During the American Revolutionary War he served as a junior officer of the Royal Highland Emigrants (84th Regiment of Foot), and also as colonel of the militia of Queens County, Nova Scotia. He was, in large part, responsible for ensuring that southwestern Nova Scotia remained loyal to the King during the Revolution. The district now known as the Municipality of the District of Argyle was named by MacKinnon in reference to his homeland in western Scotland. French and Indian War Ranald MacKinnon was born in the Isle of Mull in 1737. His ancestry can be traced to Ian Na Mishnish, chief of the MacKinnon clanBrown, George S.; Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: A Sequel to Campbell's History; reprinted 1995, Argyle Municipal Historical and Genealogical Society, Tusket, NS, p. 269 On September 21, 1758, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 77th Reg't. of Foot. He served with the 77th in several campaigns during the war, including Gen. John Forbes' expedition against Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburgh, PA, in 1758.Dictionary of Canadian Biography, http://www.biographi.ca/EN/009004-119.01-e.php?&id;_nbr=2543 He was wounded in battle against the Cherokee Nation in North Carolina during the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1760,Brown, p. 269 but recovered to join the expedition to retake St. John's, NL from the French in 1762.Dictionary of Canadian Biography At the end of the war in 1763 he went on half-pay, and soon found a job as part of a surveying party in southwest Nova Scotia.Brown, p. 270 Between the Wars MacKinnon took a liking to an area of southwest NS known by the Mi'qmaw people as Abuptic. With its seacoast islands and rivers it reminded him of his home in the Inner Hebrides.Dictionary of Canadian Biography He applied to the Assembly of Nova Scotia for a grant of 2,000 acres, which was given on 1 April 1766.Dictionary of Canadian Biography MacKinnon's grant extended to the north of what is now called the Argyle River, including Robert's Island and Ste. Anne du Ruisseau.http://www.grassroutes.com/yarmouth/villages/argyle/history/mack1.htm MacKinnon chose to call this area Argyle, after his native home. On 20 November 1766, he married Letitia Piggot, the daughter of a British Army officer, in Halifax. The couple had five sons and eight daughters over the coming years.Brown, p. 270 One son, John, went on to represent the County of Shelburne in the provincial Legislature from 1820 to 1832.http://www.grassroutes.com/yarmouth/villages/argyle/history/mack1.htm MacKinnon settled on what is now called Sargent's Hill, just north of the Argyle River in Glenwood.Ricker, Jackson; Historical Sketches of Glenwood and the Argyles, Yarmouth Co., NS; reprinted by Sentinel Printing Ltd., Yarmouth, NS, 1994, pp. 122 - 23 The lands he sub-divided to John are now known as MacKinnon's Neck. The remains Ranald MacKinnon's home, Sargeant's Hill in Glenwood, Nova Scotia. The pear trees are likely his original plantings. During the 1760s the government of Nova Scotia encouraged New Englanders to emigrate. Many of these Planters moved to established townships, such as Yarmouth. Others chose to take up lands where townships had not been established, like Argyle. In 1763, Jeremiah Frost and fifteen other families arrived from New England and settled on the Abuptic River,Campbell, Rev. J.R.; A History of the County of Yarmouth Nova Scotia; reprinted by Mika Studio, Belleville, ON, 1972, p. 67 south of the lands that would be granted to MacKinnon. With the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the British government allowed Acadians who had been expelled from Nova Scotia in 1755 and afterwards to return if they chose to do so. Many did so choose, but as most of their former lands had been seized by New Englanders they were forced to re-settle to other areas, such as Pubnico. MacKinnon was willing to lease some of his lands to Acadians in the area of Ste. Anne du Ruisseau,Ricker, p. 128 much to the disgust of the New Englanders, who were prejudiced against the Acadians as Papists. In general, MacKinnon did not get along well with his Planter neighbours and they were sometimes openly hostile to him. \\"McKinnon was alien to them in many other ways: he was an Anglican among dissenters, a customs official among inveterate smugglers, and an aristocrat among levellers.Dictionary of Canadian Biography\\" American Revolutionary War News of the outbreak of war in Massachusetts, specifically the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, arrived in Argyle in the early summer of 1775. Most of the Argyle Planters were sympathetic to the rebellion; the Rev. John Frost preached a sermon in which he \\"expressed his hopes that the British forces in America might be returned to England 'confuted and confused'\\".Campbell, p. 69 Jeremiah Frost, his brother, a captain of the militia and the acknowledged leader of the Planters, went so far as to erect a Liberty Pole, openly announcing that the community had broken with the Crown. Nathaniel Ricker, another officer of the militia, chopped the Liberty Pole down.Ricker, p. 95 Meanwhile, MacKinnon had traveled to Halifax to get support from the Council to suppress the rebellion in Argyle. The Governor in Council proposed: > That Mr. McKinnon do, without loss of time, proceed to Argyle with twenty > men of the recruits now raising here for the King's service, and be > furnished with four barrels of gunpowder and ball in proportion, to be by > him accounted for.Campbell, p. 69 MacKinnon returned to Argyle with his twenty armed men (probably from the Royal Fencible Americans) along with a commission as Colonel of the Militia of Queens County,Campbell, p. 69 which at that time stretched from Liverpool to Yarmouth. The presence of these armed men suppressed the attempted rebellion in Argyle, and essentially throughout southwest Nova Scotia. MacKinnon's commission also recommended him for a place as an officer in the raising Royal Highland Emigrants. He became the captain of the light infantry company of the 2nd Battalion, where he remained for the duration. In November 1776, the light company (along with the grenadier company) of the 84th was sent to Windsor from Halifax for the relief of Fort Cumberland, and made a remarkable forced march of 50 miles (80.5 km) in two days, but both companies were becalmed in the Minas Basin and had to return to Windsor.Clarke, Ernest; The Siege of Fort Cumberland, pp 159, 162, 175, 187 On September 4, 1778, MacKinnon led his company in the Raid of Cape Sable Island, surprising the crew of an American privateer, taking and burning the ship. For his aggressive action, MacKinnon was praised highly by Brigadier General Eyre Massey. In response, one of his friends, Cpt. MacDonald, wrote to Major John Small, \\"McKinnon was embarrassed by the praise of the General and requested it not be inserted in the record since he only did his duty.Kim Stacy (1994). No One harms me with impunity - the History, Organization and Biographies of the 84th Highland Regiment (Royal Highland Emigrants) and Young Royal Highlanders during the Revolutionary War 1775-1784. Unpublished manuscript. p. 29\\" MacKinnon and his company took part in the Siege of Charleston and eventually stationed in Charleston. His company saw action around South Carolina as a detachment of the 84th at Wiggin's Hill near Augusta in 1781.https://www.carolana.com/SC/Revolution/revolution_wiggins_hill_1.html Later years With the arrival of the Loyalists following the war, Shelburne became the leading town in southwest Nova Scotia, and MacKinnon relocated there sometime before 1791. According to poll tax recordshttp://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/polltax/results.asp?Search=shelburne&SearchButton;=Search+Poll+Tax&Start;=326 he had gained a civil service position as an impost and excise tax collector, and was sufficiently well-to-do to be paying ten pounds sterling per year in poll taxes. His feud with the Frost family of Argyle went on, at least in his mind. In December 1804, a few months prior to his death, MacKinnon wrote his daughter, Penelope, out of his will, \`\`thus for her unnatural and perfidious conduct some three years back.\`\`Ranald MacKinnon's last will and testament, copy from Shelburne County Genealogical Society, probated at Shelburne, 25 May 1805 Penelope had married a Frost. Ranald MacKinnon died 28 April 1805, in Shelburne, at the age of 68. Slaves At some point after receiving his grant in 1766, MacKinnon brought in a number of African slaves whom he had purchased, probably in North Carolina, where he had served during the French and Indian War. The number of people he held in slavery is unknown, but as the lands they worked for their sustenance was referred to as a \\"Slave farm\\"Ricker, p. 125 there were likely 2 - 3 families. However, there is no mention of slaves in MacKinnon's will (dated 1801),Ranald MacKinnon's last will and testament which leads to the conclusion that the slaves were liberated or sold sometime before that date.
