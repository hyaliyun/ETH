It was formed in 1924, when Count Stefan Tyszkiewicz, an inventor and mechanical engineer, started a small automotive firm \\"Automobiles Ralf Stetysz\\" in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris. The name was an acronym in Polish of the name \\"Rolniczo Automobilowo- Lotnicza Fabryka Stefana Tyszkiewicza\\" - \\"Agricultural-Automobile-Aero Factory of Stefan Tyszkiewicz\\"). Stetysz car and Stefan Tyszkiewicz (1926) Advertising of Stetysz cars Tyszkiewicz designed several prototypes, drawing heavily on contemporary French car designs, but better suited for the dismal Polish roads of the time. A single prototype was completed, with a strengthened suspension, a locking differential and a powerful Continental engine. It was presented at the 1926 and 1927 Paris Motor Show, where it received positive reviews as a good \\"colonial car\\".\\"Automobilia\\". Toutes les voitures fran√ßaises 1927 (salon [Paris, Oct] 1926). Paris: Histoire & collections. Nr. 78s: Page 57. 2006. The prototype proved interesting and in 1927 Tyszkiewicz was able to secure cooperation with the Warsaw-based K. Rudzki i S-ka company to start serial production, under the Stetysz brand. The company produced all the mechanical parts and assembled the vehicles while the bodywork was manufactured by Plage i La≈õkiewicz of Lublin, the aeronautical company. Eventually, Ralf-Stetysz launched two models for the 1929 model year, both available in several configurations: * Stetysz TA, with a 4-cylinder Continental engine of 1500 ccm displacement * Stetysz TC, with a 6-cylinder Continental engine of 2760 ccm The initial batch of roughly 200 cars of both models proved durable, and their sales looked promising. The cars were featured at the Pozna≈Ñ International Fair and marketed as \\"the first Polish-made car\\" and as a vehicle \\"ideal for bad roads\\".http://polskie-auta.pl/stara/ralf.htm Zdjƒôcia samochod√≥w Ralf- Stetysz - Photographs of Stetysz cars. The car took part in numerous rallies, including the 1929 Monte Carlo Rally where it initially fared very well, arriving in Paris first. However, near Lyons, the co-driver was taken ill and had to be admitted to hospital, which cost so much time that the car was obliged to drop out of the race. On 11 February 1929 the Stetysz Warsaw factory was completely gutted by fire, along with a number of already completed vehicles awaiting delivery. Tyszkiewicz wanted to rebuild the factory, but the move was blocked by shareholders of K. Rudzki & S-ka, a firm specialising primarily in bridge construction. Eventually, Stefan Tyszkiewicz resigned himself to discontinue his own brand and focused instead on importing and producing, under licence, FIAT and Mercedes models.

Early life Hassan graduated from the Sapienza University of Rome. He initially worked on the Somali film Dan iyo Xarago. Between 1979 and 1983, he served as a representative of the Somali Film Agency in Rome. The SFA had been established a few years earlier in 1975 as an adjunct to the Ministry of Information and National Guidance. Hassan directed and produced educational films and facilitated life skill programs for higher education. In this capacity, he produced films about sustainable agricultural policy projects such as the ‚ÄúKu Baahi baxa Beeraha‚Äù or ‚ÄúKa Faa‚Äôideyso Kaluunka‚Äù. The film was about agricultural and livestock farming, important sources for developing cultivation. The project was initiated in 1980 and jointly funded by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Fishery among other institutions to have a positive impact on the nation's agricultural sector. Biography Throughout his work in the film industry, Hassan oversaw regional and district film programs to ensure the quality of film publications. He also worked with the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. In 1980-1981, Hassan was among the filmmakers that participated in the annual Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) in Mogadishu. The film festival was organized by the Somali Film Agency and brought together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as Asia and Europe. In 1984, Hassan initiated and invested in Somali visual art posters. He personally designed/printed a number of the high quality posters, as well as Somali postal stamps. One of his posters was dedicated to Istunka, a traditional pre-Islamic festival held annually in the southern town of Afgooye, situated near Mogadishu. In 1985 to 1987, Hassan became the Somali Airlines manager for advertisement, promotion and marketing. In 1987, he was the head of a photographic exhibition on Somali history, which roughly translates as \\"Somalis should be cognizant of the history of Somalia\\". Part of the photographs were taken in Ras Aseyr to Ras Kiyanboni, northeastern coastal areas flanking the Indian Ocean. In addition, Hassan was the creator and sole proprietorship of the Golol Art Gallery, He collected and preserved more than thirty years worth of Somali history. These valuable audio-visual records included the historical lives of the founding fathers of Somalia (the Somali Youth League), as well as the history of Somali arts and crafts. Present After a coalition of clan-based armed opposition groups ousted Siad Barre's military regime in 1991, Hassan embarked on recording events during the ensuing civil war. In 1999, he left Somalia, moving to Frankfurt, Germany, where he continued to preserve Somali documents. Hassan also started to work for the Deutsches Filmmuseum, Germany's national film museum department. Additionally, he organized the Golol Art Gallery, a cultural exhibition on the traditions of Somalia. In 2010, Hassan started the Keydmedia Online news and audiovisual service.

He continued his career in Australia as player and coach. Life and career Lees was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He began his football career as an apprentice with Hull City, and made his first-team debut for the club on the last day of the 1966‚Äì67 Football League season, in a 4‚Äì1 defeat away to Crystal Palace in the Second Division. Over the next three-and-a-half years, he made just five more senior appearances for Hull, and in December 1970, he joined Fourth Division club Hartlepool on loan. He scored Hartlepool's first goal in his debut match, a 2‚Äì1 win at home to York City, and played regularly for the remainder of the season, finishing with 20 appearances, all in league competition. In the 1971 close season, Lees moved on to Darlington, also a Fourth Division club. He was involved in one potentially disastrous incident while playing in a floodlit match at the Darlington's Feethams ground. While retrieving the ball, which had gone out of play, he noticed that rubbish beneath a wooden stand had caught fire. Fortunately the fire had not taken hold and was quickly extinguished. Over six seasons he scored 5 goals from 120 league appearances before his contract was cancelled in 1977. Lees continued his football career with 15 years in Australia, first as a player and later, after taking courses under the auspices both of the Australian Soccer Federation and the English Football Association, as a coach. After coaching amateur team Parafield Gardens, he was appointed head coach of South Australia State League team Beograd-Woodville in December 1986, but was dismissed in mid-season after the club committee disagreed with his selection policy. After his successor resigned early the following season, Lees was offered an apology and his old job back. He was by then committed to a junior coaching role at West Adelaide Hellas, but a couple of months later was appointed head coach of Modbury, newly promoted to the State League. Ahead of the 1990 season, he was appointed assistant to Arthur Ruttley at Port Adelaide; three months later, Ruttley was sacked and Lees \\"resigned in protest\\", again over a matter of team selection. Appointed head coach of Cumberland United ahead of the 1991 season, Lees resigned his post in March 1992 and returned to England.

A number of local artists and hunters were involved in the creation and the development of museum's dioramas. In the early 1960s a fire destroyed the Museum's exhibitions \\"Wolves attack the elk\\" and \\"Snowy owl\\", which were restored in 1964-1965. The famous \\"Flora and Fauna\\" exhibition was divided to the 4 seasons. In 1965 the department of nature became the most popular part of the Museum and in 1966 it was organized to display Ivan Rubinsky collection of over 4500 insects from the Russian Empire. The Nature department was transformed in 2001 to the independent Kostroma region Museum of Nature and was transferred to a separate building in the central part of city.

During his five years in Italy, Daoud Corm studied the works of Renaissance artists whose influence was evident throughout his works. He gained official recognition when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of Pope Pius IX (reg 1846-78). Upon his return to Lebanon in 1875, he painted portraits of many Arabs including Abbas II of Egypt (reg 1892‚Äì1914) in 1894. Daoud Corm was a religious painter and there are many of his paintings in churches across Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Palestine.Daoud Corm, The Concise Grove Dictionary of Art In 1912, Corm expanded his artistic enterprise and its public appeal when he opened Maison d'Art, an art supply store and art studio centrally located near Beirut's post office. Its significant commercial success indicated a growing public interest not only in art viewing but also in art making. Corm exhibited his work abroad in Egypt and Europe, most notably at the 1889 Versailles Exhibition in France and at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, where he received the Prize of Honor of Excellence. Additional recognition of his career includes receipt of the Lebanese Order of Merit and the Ottoman Medal of Glory. In 1930, Daoud Corm died in Beirut at age 77. Early life Daoud was born in the town of Ghosta, Mount Lebanon in 1852. He was one of three children born to an affluent family of scribes and clerks.Salameh 2015, p.76 His father Sham'un Hokayem, also known by his court title al-Chidiac, was a child prodigy, an accomplished polymath and a polyglot.Salameh 2015, p.77 His mother was from the village of Ghazir.Salameh 2010, p. 129. The teenage Sham'un was enlisted as a clerk to Emir Bashir Shihab II and as a tutor to his children. The young princes were contemptuous of their adolescent teacher who lost his temper because of his pupils' constant defiance and slapped the eldest of them in the face. When confronted by Emir Bashir, Sham'un exhibited courage and rectitude and justified his act by saying that it was his duty to tutor and educate the princes so that they become worthy of their father's standing. The impressed Emir Bachir replied to Sham'un \\"by God, you are truly one valiant spirited steed!\\" and rewarded him with a large purse of gold coins and a permanent appointment as court clerk and instructor which Sham'un would occupy for the next eighteen years of his life. From then on Sham'un was known as Al-Corm, a title that stuck to him and eventually replaced his Hokayem surname. Daoud's mother, Marie Hani, was maid of honor to Emir Bachir's second wife. Early biographersMalouf 1944, p.3 relate that friars from the Jesuit College of Ghazir discovered Daoud's drawing skill when he was only nine years old. Corm's talent was furthered in his apprenticeship in the Jesuit college,Kaufman 2015, p.88Rogers 2010, p.49Sheehi 2006, p. 77 where the friars pushed him to pursue painting studies in Rome's fine art academy.Salameh 2015, p.79 In Europe (1870-1878) Corm sold a number of paintings to a local Maronite church to pay for his travels to Rome.Rogers 2010, p.51 In 1870, after several days of foot travel, the eighteen years old Corm arrived in Beirut where he boarded a French ship headed to Naples.Kaufman 2014, p.88Lahoud 1974, p.8 He traveled by train from Naples to Rome and resided in the Maronite seminary along with his future patron and Maronite patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek. Corm sought to study under Roberto Bompiani, professor and director of the Accademia di San Luca; he repetitively visited Bompiani's house but the latter's servants did not allow him an interview. Frustrated after weeks of failed attempts, Corm threw down his portfolio and quarreled with the professor's servants. Bompiani was alerted by the commotion and came out to find the foreign looking man disheveled and his paintings scattered on the floor. The professor picked up one of Daoud's paintings and recognizing the young man's potential, he took him under his tutelage. Corm spent the next several years studying at the academy and visiting museums and churches and copying the works of the Renaissance masters.Rogers 2010, pp. 52, 56Salameh 2015, p.80 On 24 July 1874, Daoud dispatched a letter to his family informing them that his travel companion to Rome, father Rukoz, promised to introduce him to pope Pius IX.Rogers 2010, p.74Mohasseb 1998, pp. 56‚Äì57 Corm's request to paint the pope and send the portrait back to his parents in Mount Lebanon was met with refusal. Despite this setback, Corm drew the pope the same night from memory. Bompiani was impressed by his student's feat and presented the finished portrait to pope Pius who blessed the painting. The portrait is now part of Vatican Library collection. After his training in Rome, Daoud moved to Belgium where he served as one of the official painters to the Belgian royal family under Leopold II.Civantos 2015, p.304Sheehi 2006, pp. 77‚Äì78 In Beirut (1878-1930) Khalil Bey Sursock, a Beiruti aristocrat and philanthropist, 1882. oil on canvas, 130 x 100cm, Emile Hannouche Museum collection, Chtaura|alt= portrait of a middle aged mustached man wearing an Ottoman fez and dark formal aristocratic attire. Between 1839 and 1876 the Ottomans issued a series of reforms (the Tanzimat) that brought changes to Beirut's political and administrative roles. The reforms, along with low import duties for foreign merchants,Low import duties applied for foreign merchants was a result of the Treaty of Balta Liman. the establishment of the Ottoman Imperial Bank in 1850, the building of the new wharf, the construction of the Beirut- Damascus road and the population surge following the 1860 Lebanon conflict made Beirut the unrivaled port city of the Levant. The flourishing city attracted a host of families migrating from Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, Acre, Sidon and Mount Lebanon to join the growing community of Beirut's merchant families.√ñzt√ºrk 2006, pp. 56‚Äì72 Corm sought the favors and patronage of this class of bourgeois merchants when he settled back in Beirut in 1878. To appeal to the Beiruti nobility, Corm engaged F√©lix Bonfils' studio to take a photograph of him applying the finishing touches to Pope Pius IX's portrait and used this photograph as his calling card. By using a business card of him portraying the pope, Corm aimed to sell for a bourgeois artist whose artistic aptitude and western education was endorsed by the foremost potico-religious leader of the time.Rogers 2010, p.53 Among Corm's first aristocratic Beiruti clients were the Sursocks a rich Greek Orthodox merchant family that demonstrated its cultural capital by investing in art patronage. Corm was commissioned portraits for Khalil Bey Surscok in 1882, Mahjet Sursock in 1892, Moussa Sursock and his wife Anasthasia Dagher in 1897. Other clients were no less notable and included Hussein Beyhum, the president of the Syrian scientific association and deputy in the Ottoman house of representatives; Jurji Zaydan, novelist and journalist, most noted for his creation of the al-Hilal magazine; viscount Philippe de Tarazzi (1917), a polymath, philanthropist, the founder of the National Library of Lebanon and the curator of the National Museum; Butrus al-Bustani a leading figure in the al-Nahda literary movement,Rogers 2010, p.67 and Ibrahim al- Yaziji an illustrious philologist and journalist.Sheehi 2016, pp. 38‚Äì39 Corm benefited from the growing interest in art in Beirut and facilitated the spread of the craft by opening an art supply shop in the center of Beirut in 1912. His shop, called Maison d'Art (House of art) was a commercial success and later included a darkroom for developing pictures of the first handheld cameras. Corm himself took interest in the newly introduced technology and took photographs of his family.Rogers 2010, p.69 Style and influence During his formative years in Rome, Corm spent much of his time in the city's museums copying the facial expressions and hand gestures of the Renaissance masters' works. This emphasis on human anatomy and the formal traces of Renaissance masters is apparent in Corm's portraiture.Rogers 2010, pp. 56‚Äì57 Corm painted his subjects in a three-quarter view in soft light against a dark background. He paid particular attention to the details of his subjects' social and professional standing. In addition to portraits, Corm painted few landscapes and genre scenes on spec because of the limited market for these types of paintings; in contrast to his portraits, Corm's genre scenes are described as theatrical and overly staged as evident in his Bedouin woman with her child 1900 painting.Rogers 2010, pp. 67‚Äì68, 77 Along with artists, Mustafa Farrukh (1901-1957), Omar Onsi (1901-1969), C√©sar Gemayel (Qaisarr Jumayil) (1898-1958), Saliba Douaihy (Saliba Duwaihi) (b. 1915) and Rachid Wehbi (Rachid Wahbah)(b. 1917), Corm is regarded as a pioneer, having laid the foundations for a modern Lebanese arts movement. This group of artists defied the imposed emphasis on religious works, and instead established an originality and freedom of expression that had never before been seen in Lebanon. Zuhur, S. (ed.), Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East, American University of Cairo Press, 2001, p. 369 =Religious paintings= Corm's first client was the Maronite church especially under the patronage of then- Maronite patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek, his once travel companion to Italy. He painted a great number of religious works that are found not only in his native Lebanon but also in neighboring Syria, Egypt and Palestine. According to Lahoud, Corm rid Lebanese religious art from a traditionalist, local neo- gothic style and, by introducing classical painting, started a movement of academic art-making in Beirut.Lahoud 1974, pp.1‚Äì2 Notes References Bibliography *Abillama, Nour and Tomb, Marie (2012).

Each 473L site included a Data Processing Subsystem (DPSS), Integrated Console Subsystem (ICSS), Large Panel Display Subsystem, and Data Communications Subsystem (Automatic Digital Network interface: \\"AUTODIN Data Terminal Bay\\"). The \\"System 473L\\" was an \\"on-line, real-time information processing system designed to facilitate effective management of USAF resources, particularly during emergency situations\\" e.g., for: \\"situation monitoring, resource monitoring, plan evaluation, plan generation and modification, and operations monitoring\\". In 1967, the 473L System was used during the \\"HIGH HEELS 67\\" exercise \\"to test the whole spectrum of command in a strategic crisis\\". Background In early 1952, the Pentagon's USAF Command Post (AFCP) \\"arranged\\" to receive Air Defense Command (ADC) exercise data such as for planned mock attacks into defense sectors by faker aircraft (e.g., in 1955 on Amarillo, Denver, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, San Antonio7th WING OPERATIONS HISTORY, 1955-1958 . 7bwb-36assn.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-18. and Phoenix.) An Experimental SAGE Subsector\\" for testing a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) was created using a July 1955 prototype air defense computer ADC's 1955 command post blockhouse was completed at Ent AFB, and \\"in September 1955, the Air Force‚Ä¶replace[d its] command post's outmoded telephone system with a modern switchboard with 100 long-distance lines and room for more, so that 20 people in various parts of the country could hold as many as four conferences at a time\\". The Alternate Joint Communication Center in the Raven Rock nuclear bunker was equipped by the end of 1955, and ADC broke ground in 1957 for deploying the Burroughs 416L SAGE Air Defense System (the BMEWS 474L General Operational Requirement was specified in 1958.) After President Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed concern about nuclear command and control, a \\"1958 reorganization in NCA relations with the joint commands\\" was implemented, and the \\"AWCS 512L\\" system was deployed by June 1958. The GOR for a computerized 465L SAC Automated Command and Control System was issued in 1958 for Strategic Air Command's nuclear bunkers (1957 Offutt AFB bunker & 1958 at The Notch). A Joint War Room was activated at the Pentagon in 1960 and in December 1960, the AFCP reverted to a USAF-only mission when its \\"joint and national responsibilities\\" ended. (cited by Wainstein Study S-467 p. 119) After a \\"Quick Fix\\" program completed in the fall of 1960 and NORAD's Alert Network Number 1 was providing data from the Ent AFB command post in Colorado Springs, the AFCP had several rear projection screens, DEFCON status boards, and a display with colored regional blocks for the Bomb Alarm System (work had started in May 1959 for transmitting BAS data to \\"six command centers\\".) In January 1962, the Deep Underground Command Center was planned as a nuclear bunker beneath the Pentagon (the Raven Rock bunker would be phased out.) The Air Force Command Post Systems Division was activated in 1960 for handling AFCP equipment issues (cf. AFSC's Electronic Systems Division which had the SPO) and in October 1962, DoD Directive S-5100.30 \\"designated 473L as the ‚ÄúAir Force service headquarters subsystem‚Äù of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) established the same month.\\" OTC phase The \\"Operational and Training Capability\\" (OTC) phase by IBM Federal Systems was the first stage of development for the 473 program. Each \\"Computer Communication Console\\" by TRW Space Technology Laboratories for OTC was part of the \\"DC400B/DIB display and interrogation system\\" that had 2 \\"10-inch CRT displays together with a sophisticated keyboard\\" This \\"temporary 473L system\\" had an IBM 1401 computer and IBM 1405 Disk Storage Unit. On January 1, 1963, ESD's 473L System Program Office was expanded (473L/492L SPO) with the added 492L responsibility for developing the United States Strike Command's Joint Airborne Communications Center/Command Post (SPOs were separated on June 15, 1965). OUR phase As an upgrade before the IOC phase, an IBM 1410 was leased in February 1964, and the IBM 1401 computer was phased out by April‚Äîrevision of OTC software for the 1410 computer was by Project OUR (OTC Update and Revision). IOC phase The Librascope AN/FYQ-11 Data Processor Set was \\"a configuration of the L-3055\\" computer that Librascope manufactured at Glendale procured for the Initial Operational Capability phase with limited FYQ-11 equipment (e.g., without OA-6041 Control-Indicator Console). (webpage transcription at MarksMath.com) and only \\"4 integrated consoles\\". FYQ-11 had been accepted by the USAF Electronic Systems Division in late March 1965 to replace the IBM 1410 (each FYQ-11 was \\"234 cu ft [and required] 500 sq ft\\" area). The FYQ-11 had been proposed on February 19, 1962, for the Complete Operational Capability (dual AN/FYQ-11 sets with only a single OA-6041.) COC programs planned for the L-3055 included the \\"Deployment Monitor\\", \\"ACE- Tactical\\", and \\"ACE-Transport\\" (Computer Based Training on the FYQ-11 was also planned.) After FYQ-11 problems, the USAF Chief of Staff in 1966 cancelled the AN/FYQ-11 and the Comptroller was directed to dispose of \\"the L-3055 system's equipment\\" (1977 lawsuit claims by the 1968 Librascope parent--The Singer Company‚Äîwere denied.) Complete operational capability A second IBM 1410 computer was installed by December 15, 1966, and the entire 473L System included: ;AN/FYA-2 Integrated Data Transfer Console: The AN/FYA-2 (\\"473L Integrated Console\\"http://bitsavers.trailing- edge.com/pdf/informatics/antaccs/ANTACCS_Final_Report_Phase_One_Volume_V_Technology_Part_1_Jan65.pdf |Consoles tied to a core memory buffer which is connected to an IBM 1401 or 1410 at the Air Force Command Post (OTC of 473L). ‚Ä¶ Data Display Central 465L ‚Ä¶ LTV 7000 High Speed Display System with Logic Keyboard Display (LKB) provided the fully equipped 473L operator environment‚Äîcf. AN/FYA-3 didn't have a Hard Copy Device (HC) for the Multicolored Display (MC), nor a Console Printer (CP); while the AN/FYA-4 only had an Electronic Typewriter/Display (RT) and CP. The console was run by a Monitor Program in the DPSS, and \\"operational capabilities [were] exercised via operational capability overlays; that is, via plastic masks fitting over the logic keyboard portion of the operator console.\\" The original COC plan was for DPSS output for 11 MCs and 15 CPs (i.e., 4 of the simplest AN/FYA-4 consoles for printing reports). ;Query Language (473L Query):https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai- repository/ai/areas/doc/bib/langs.txt (cites \\"Sammet 1969, p.665.\\") Query Language was \\"very similar to the COLINGO query language and was \\"a constrained English language‚Ä¶for man-machine communication in System 473L. ‚Ä¶to retrieve data from any file in the system or to perform certain other functions.\\" For example, the code for airfields both within Brazil and within a 2000-mile great-circle distance of Brazilia is: ::Retrieve airfields with country > Brazil, GCD (Brazilia ¬ª 2000) ;Large Panel Display Subsystem: IT&T; was awarded the May 1965 contract for the large 473L display which was to present information in both black and white and in color.

It closed down on 21 March 2014 after being in existence for over a century due to persistent losses suffered by the owners. History New Empire originally opened in 1908 as a live theatre and hosted plays. It was then known as the Empire Theatre. In 1948, it was completely overhauled by British architect M.A. Riddley Abbott and reopened as New Empire with a seating capacity of nearly a thousand. The New Empire Cinema was taken over by 20th Century Fox Corp. in 1955 and was the Bombay showcase cinema for their films. New Empire was one of the oldest single-screen cinema halls in Mumbai and the first in Asia to have a cantilevered balcony. Similar cinema halls that were built in the Art Deco style and opened subsequently in the south Mumbai area were Regal (opened in 1933), Metro (opened in 1938) and Liberty (opened in 1949). The first film it screened was in 1930 ‚Äì the talkie Vagabond King. Ownership It was originally owned by the Bombay Improvement Trust, which used to carry out civic works in the city. The theatre was bought by Mr. Keki Mody in 1935 who is the father-in-law of the current owner Mr. Burge Cooper. Architectural style Empire Theatre was built as an elaborate Victorian structure. It was made in the Baroque style by architect Arthur Payne with the interiors done by O‚ÄôConnor and Gerard. In 1948, it underwent a complete overhaul and was rebuilt in the then-prevalent Art Deco style of architecture. Current state New Empire suffered major losses owing to stiff competition from multiplexes. Another reason for the losses was the steep entertainment tax of 45 percent imposed by the Maharashtra government from which the multiplexes were exempt. The cinema suffered losses every month for 7 years with an accumulated loss of nearly Rs. 26 million. It closed its operations on 21 March 2014.

Built about 1914 as part of the large Amory summer estate, it is a distinctive local example of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Foothill Farm is located in a rural setting southwest of Dublin Pond and north of Mount Monadnock, on the west side of Old Troy Road a short way south of Old Marlborough Road. It is a -story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof in the Dutch Colonial style, and a sloping shed-roofed dormer on the front facade, topped by a smaller gable roof dormer with balcony. The house is attached by a -story gambrel roofed ell to a similarly-styled barn. The house was built c. 1914 for Mrs. William Amory as a replacement for an older farmhouse, whose foundation stands nearby. It was probably designed by John Lavalle, who also designed the Amory House that served as the seat of the Amory family's country estate in the early 1900s. The estate extended up the northern flanks of Mount Monadnock between Pumpelly Ridge and Old Troy Road. This property was sold out of that estate in the 1930s.

He is at present (2014) Senior Professor Emeritus at the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona and coordinator of a Research Group on States, Nations and Sovereignties, linked to the UPF. Early life and education He is the son of Eduardo Guerra Da Cal and Margarita Ucelay, Spanish exiles from the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, and the nephew of Matilde Ucelay. Between 1965 and 1969 he studied at Bard College in New York City (now Bard University), graduated with a BA in 1969 and was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship. Accepted at the Graduate School of the University of Columbia in New York City, he studied with Arno Mayer and Robert O. Paxton (with whom he worked briefly as \\"research assistant \\"). He completed his Ph.D. in 1979 with a dissertation titled Catalan State : Strategies of Separation of Catalan Radical Nationalism and Revolution (1919-1933) ( Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States: University Microfilms International), a thesis initially directed by Paxton and then by the scholar on Spanish politics Edward Malefakis. This thesis was largely based on systematic interviewing, and the location of Catalan printed materials, as much of the archival sources were still inaccessible in the 1970s. In 1972 he moved to Spain to research his dissertation. He was soon offered an instructorship at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), beginning in 1974. As Spanish legislation required citizenship for tenure status, Ucelay-Da Cal somewhat disingenuously maintained his situation as professor by obtaining a degree in Contemporary (i.e. Modern) History at the University of Barcelona in 1980 and, in 1983, a doctorate in history at the UAB with a new thesis, written in Catalan, re- researched and with a slight change of temporal focus, El nacionalisme radical catal√† i la resist√®ncia a la Dictadura de Primo de Rivera, 1923-1931, directed by Josep Fontana. To document this new text, Ucelay-Da Cal worked in numerous archives of France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal and of course, Spain, which, because of standard time access clauses (usually fifty years), were previously closed to investigators working on the 1920s. The documentary research did not produce significant changes in the narrative previously established by oral and press sources. In 1983 he obtained Spanish citizenship, and was granted tenure. University teaching Accordingly, between 1983 and 1995, Ucelay-Da Cal was tenured ‚ÄúTitular Professor‚Äù of Contemporary history at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona. After the corresponding ‚Äúopposition‚Äù or public contest for promotion characteristic of the Spanish University system, he became Senior Professor (‚Äúcatedr√°tico‚Äù) of contemporary history at the same university from 1995 to 2006. Since 2006, he has been senior professor of contemporary history at the Pompeu Fabra University, also in Barcelona. From 2009 to 2013 he participated in the Advanced Grant Project from the European Research Council (ERC) State Building in Latin America, at the UPF.State Building in Latin America Although he has not been particularly active in teaching abroad, he was ‚Äúvisiting professor \\" at Duke University between February and April 1994, taught also at Venice International University (Italy) in the spring semester of 2002, and received as \\" visiting scholar \\" at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (√âcole des Hautes Etudes de Sciences Sociales) in Paris in April 2004. He directed the dissertations of historians, some whom have since gone on to very distinguished investigatory careers: as examples, one can cite Xavier Casals, who has become unquestionably the major specialist in Neo- Nazism in Spain; David Martinez Fiol, who pioneered research on the impact of the First World War in Catalonia; Joan Maria Thom√†s, a top specialist on the Spanish Falange movement; and Joan Esculies, a rising figure among scholars of Catalan nationalism; among others. He has been open to work with researchers younger than himself. For many years, he collaborated closely with , the main Spanish researcher on Eastern Europe. More recently, he has also prepared books and projects on politically controversial topics in Catalan history together with Arnau Gonz√†lez i Vilalta, a younger Catalan historian specializing in the diplomatic contacts of Catalan nationalism. Historical Work Ucelay-Da Cal has focused on his career production on the contemporary history of Spain and Catalonia, Spanish nationalism and Catalan nationalism, as well as specific issues such as the role of Catalan independence (the Estat Catal√† movement, in particular) before and during the Second Spanish Republic, as well as during the Spanish Civil War. In broader terms, he has called for greater attention to regional dynamics in the explanation of 'national' history. He has insisted on themes such as the analysis of populism in SpainVid. his article \\"El pueblo contra la clase: populismo legitimador, revoluciones y sustituciones pol√≠ticas en Catalu√±a (1936-1939)\\" in Ayer, num. 50, 2003. and its connections or analogies with Latin America. As regards the Spanish Civil War, he has called the use of the anthropology of religion as a means to interpret many trends considered usually as exclusively ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù. He has evinced a strong skepticism regarding many of the suppositions that govern the leading interpretations in contemporary Spanish history. Publications Enric Ucelay-Da Cal has published over two hundred articles in academic journals and other history serial publications, as well as in books in Spanish, Catalan, English, French, and Italian.

Candace Wheeler: The Art and Enterprise of American Design, 1875‚Äì1900. Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 January 2001. p. 100-101  Biography  Smith was born in Britain in 1836, and graduated at the South Kensington School of Art in London. After graduation, Smith settled in Leeds, where he became headmaster of the Leeds, Holbeck and Keighley School of Art. He also became headmaster of the drawing department of the Leeds Grammar School; Principal Art Master in Huddersfield College in Huddersfield, and superintendent of drawing in schools for the poor in the district of Leeds, Huddersfield, Keighley etc.Smith (1864, title page). The early 1860s commissioned by the British Lords of the Committee of Council on Education Smith made a comparison of the French and English systems of art education to suggest improvement and modification of the latter. This resulted in the 1864 publication of Report on the works of pupils, in the French schools of design, recently exhibited in the Palais de l'Industrie, Champs-Elys√©es, Paris. At the age of thirty-five, in 1871, he emigrated to the United States. In Boston, he became appointed Professor of Art Education in the City of Massachusetts Normal School of Art, and Massachusetts State director of Art Education.Smith (1872, title page). The City of Boston later also appointed him director of drawing for the city, where he had the responsibility to provide art instruction and supervision to classroom teachers in the city of Boston.Diana Korzenik (1985, p. 155). In his years in the States, he wrote a series of books on art education, and instructional works for teachers, and a drawing book for students of public schools and art schools. He also wrote a work on the Decorative arts, shown at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 in Philadelphia, Pa.. The late 1870s he gave a series of lectures to the Massachusetts Teachers Association and other National Associations on Art and technical education, which were later published. In 1882 he returned to England,Diana Korzenik. Drawn to Art: A Nineteenth-Century American Dream, University Press of New England, 1985. p. 240 where he died in four years later.  Work  Title page American text books of art education, 2nd ed. 1875 Smith was known by the larger audience for his \\"American textbooks of art education,\\" published the early 1870s, which considerably influenced American art education.Maurice Rickards, Michael Twyman (2000) The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: : A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian. p. 127 For the Massachusetts public schools he had developed an elementary curriculum of drawing, which would \\"set the standard for art education throughout the Northeast.\\" Another of Smith's accomplishments was a drawing technique, \\"based on a drawing technique developed by the English designer Christopher Dresser, his method emphasized regular ornament consisting of simple geometrical forms arranged symmetrically.\\" = Art education = Smith wrote one of the first American textbooks of art education, published in 1873. In the preface he declared, that the intention of the work was to cover the whole field of art education: : The plan of the books is the first systematic effort made in this country to cover the whole field of Art Education for schools, by embracing every subject included under the head of Elementary Drawing. Pupils going through the course in all the subjects will be thoroughly grounded and prepared either for practical industrial art or the further professional study of the fine arts.Smith (1873, Preface) = Industrial design = Smith was an early proponent of industrial design. In his 1880 American Text-books of Art Education: Drawing-books 1 and 2, he predicted their importance, stating: :The subject of industrial design is one of three important practical co-related subjects which should be taught in public schools, and to which practice and skill in drawing should be applied. Satisfactory results in this subject, however, depend entirely upon the manner in which it is taught. Instruction in industrial design means a clear presentation of the principles which obtain in the construction and harmonious arrangement of geometric form for decorative purposes, the proper use of plant forms in ornamental arrangements, and the principles of good taste to be found in the great history styles of art.Smith (1880, p. 70)  Selected publications  * 1864.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is now home to the Fairwood Bible Institute. Description and history The former Frost Farm property is located in a rural setting west of Dublin Pond, on the north side of Old Marlborough west of Charcoal Road. It is a rambling -story wood frame structure, with a clapboarded exterior and a variety of rooflines. Covered porches line some portions of the building, and some of its roofs are pierced by rows of gabled dormers. The property includes a number of later 20th-century outbuildings, including a chapel and barns. The oldest portion of this farmstead was a vernacular rectangular farmhouse built c. 1855 by Silas Frost. In 1910 it was transformed into a much larger Georgian Revival summer house by Charles Aldworth, under the auspices of architects Densmore, LeClear and Robinson of Boston, Massachusetts. It was for two seasons the residence of the polar explorer, Admiral Richard E. Byrd. In 1951 it was acquired by The Kingdom Inc., which adapted it for its present use as a bible study school.

Joseph Smith, portrait by James Maubert Early life The fifth son of William Smith, rector of Lowther, Westmorland, and younger brother of John Smith (1659‚Äì1715), he was born at Lowther, on 10 October 1670. On his father's death when he was five years old, his mother moved to Guisborough in Yorkshire, where he attended Guisborough grammar school. He went on to Durham School, and on 10 May 1689 he was admitted a scholar of The Queen's College, Oxford. In 1693 he was chosen a tabarder and graduated B.A. in 1694. Smith proceeded M.A. by diploma in 1697, having accompanied Sir Joseph Williamson, his godfather, who was one of the British plenipotentiaries, to the negotiations for the Treaty of Ryswick as his private secretary. On 31 October 1698, in his absence, he was elected a fellow of the college. Soon after his return in 1700 he took holy orders and obtained from the Provost Timothy Halton the living of Iffley, near Oxford. In 1702 he was chosen to address Queen Anne on her visit to the university. In 1704 he was elected senior proctor, and dubbed \\"handsome Smith\\" to distinguish him from his colleague Thomas Smith of St John's College. In the same year Halton died, and friends proposed him as a candidate for Provost; but Smith backed William Lancaster, his former tutor, who was elected. London positions The new Provost presented Smith to London posts: Russell Court Chapel and the lectureship of Trinity Chapel, Hanover Square, which he held until 1731. He became also chaplain to Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey, who introduced him Queen Anne, gave him opportunities of preaching before her, and obtained for him the promise of the first vacant canonry in St George's Chapel. In 1708 he took the degrees of B.D. and D.D., and on 29 November was presented by the college to the rectory of Knights Enham and to the donative of Upton Grey, both in Hampshire. In 1716 he exchanged Upton Grey for the rectory of St Dionis, Lime Street, London. On the accession of George I, Smith was again introduced to court, by the Earl of Grantham, and was made chaplain to the Princess of Wales. In 1723 Edmund Gibson, Bishop of Lincoln, an old college friend, appointed him to the prebend of Dunholm, and on Gibson's transfer to the see of London he gave him the donative of Paddington. In 1724 he was appointed to the lectureship of the new church of St George's, Hanover Square, and on 8 May 1728 Gibson gave him the prebend of St. Mary Newington in St Paul's Cathedral. Provost in Oxford Queen Caroline by Henry Cheere, The Queen's College, Oxford In 1730, on the death of John Gibson, Smith, without doing any canvassing, was chosen Provost of The Queen's College. He was a reforming head of house. Through the good offices of Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and of John Selwyn, Queen Caroline's treasurer, Smith obtained a benefaction of ¬£1000 towards adorning the college; he then had the queen's statue placed over the gateway. He induced Lady Elizabeth Hastings to settle several exhibitions on the college. He obtained an order in chancery which forced Sir Orlando Bridgeman to pay over a donation from his son Francis Bridgeman. He also arranged the foundation of eight additional fellowships as well as four scholarships by John Michel of Richmond, Surrey. Smith died in Queen's College on 23 November 1756, and was interred in the vault under the new chapel. Works Smith was the author of: * Modern Pleas for Schism and Infidelity Reviewed, London, 1717. * A Modest Review of the Bishop of Bangor's Answer to Dr. Snape, London, 1717. An early pamphlet in the Bangorian controversy, and unlike others of January 1717, under a real name. * Some Considerations offered to the Bishop of Bangor on his Preservative against the Principles of the Nonjurors, London, 1717. * The Unreasonableness of Deism, London, 1720. * Anarchy and Rebellion, 1720. * A View of the Being, Nature, and Attributes of God, Oxford, 1756; besides several sermons. To Smith has also been attributed The Difference between the Nonjurors and the Present Public Assemblies, 1716. It provoked the reply, Joseph and Benjamin; or Little Demetrius tossed in a Blanket, London, June 1717, an anonymous farce printed by John Morphew. In 1731 he drew up a statement of the architectural conditionof Queens's with an ichnography, an expansion of a statement first issued in Provost Gibson's time; and ordered cuts of the buildings by Michael Burghers (died 1727) to be re-engraved in quarto. Family In 1709 Smith married Mary Lowther, youngest daughter of Henry Lowther of Ingleton Hall in Yorkshire and of Lowther in Fermanagh, and niece of Timothy Halton. She died on 29 April 1745. By her he had three children: * Joseph, an advocate of Doctors' Commons; * Anne, married, first, to Prebendary Lamplugh, a grandson of the archbishop Thomas Lamplugh, and, secondly, to Captain James Hargraves; and * William, who died young.

South of the road is the barn, which was renovated in the second half of the 20th century, using recycled and period wooden materials. The oldest portion of the farmhouse is a small Cape-style portion that was built in 1806 by Benjamin Frost. Frost, a native of nearby Jaffrey, attempted to operate a grist mill nearby, but failed due to a lack of adequate water power. The property was sold out of the Frost family in 1852. The house was purchased in 1913 by Konstu Korpi, a Finnish immigrant, who substantially enlarged it in 1914 and in the 1950s. It became a meeting point for the small local Finnish-American community, and as a boarding house for Finnish-American woodworkers.

Wealthy and handsome Cleophas and rabbi's son Abner are both in love with Mary but she loves only Joseph, the son of a carpenter. Despite their age difference and the objections of Mary's mother, Hannah, the love between Mary and Joseph prevails, and they are betrothed. Soon after the ceremony, Mary is visited by an angel, who tells her that she will become the mother of the Messiah, whom she shall name Jesus. Mary is then faced with the responsibility of impending motherhood as well as proving to Joseph that she has not betrayed him. Meanwhile, Mary's aunt Elizabeth is also pregnant (with John the Baptist). After telling her parents and Joseph the truth, Mary's family arranges for her to come to Jerusalem to stay with Zechariah and Elizabeth temporarily. Joseph remains behind in Galilee, tormented by jealousy, until an angel visits him. Joseph's father Jacob dies and, afterwards, Joseph goes to Mary as the angel instructed. After they are married, Joseph takes Mary with him to Bethlehem, where taxes must be paid. Unable to find other accommodations, they stay in a stable, where Mary gives birth to Jesus. They are visited by wise men who bring gifts to the newborn Messiah. The wise men originally came on behalf of King Herod, who has ordered the execution of all male babies in Jerusalem to prevent the Messiah from coming to power. The wise men are warned to flee from Herod and Joseph is warned to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. The book ends with them on the journey to Egypt.

The film is directed by Aejaz Gulab and scripted by Nilesh Girkar. The film stars Nana Patekar in the lead role. It also stars Gul Panag, and Ashutosh Rana. The film is a sequel to Ab Tak Chhappan. The film was released on 27 February 2015 and met with mixed to positive reviews.RGV‚Äôs sequel to Ab Tak Chhappan - Worldnews.com The story revolves around Inspector Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) from the Mumbai Encounter Squad. It is inspired by the life of Police sub-Inspector with Mumbai Police force Daya Nayak. Plot Ab Tak Chhappan 2 opens to encounter specialist Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) proclaiming what he did was right. The film then goes into flashback, where we are shown what happened a few months back. Away from Mumbai, with a few cases pending against him, Sadhu now leads a peaceful life in his village (Goa) with his son Aman, mourning the loss of his wife. He cooks, lives in a house by the river and listens to his son playing the piano. However, his retired phase comes to a halt, when ex-police commissioner (Mohan Agashe) convinces Sadhu to get back on the job on the home minister's (Vikram Gokhale) request to tackle Mumbai's escalating crime scene. Sadhu is hesitant but his son talks him into accepting the offer, which brings him back to Mumbai. While Sadhu's encounter squad is happy to see him, Thorat (Ashutosh Rana), Sadhu's junior is not too pleased with the decision as he hopes to become the chief. Sadhu senses the rivalry and makes it clear to Thorat that he will have to follow orders. The squad begins their mission by reconnecting with their sources and targeting lower-level gangsters of two gangs (Rauf's and Rawale's gangs). Meanwhile, crime reporter Shalu Dixit (Gul Panag) becomes a regular visitor at Sadhu's residence, since she wants to finish the book on 'encounter cops', which her journalist father wasn't able to complete before he was shot by a gangster. As the encounter squad goes on a shooting spree, Sadhu starts getting threats from unknown parties. Soon, Sadhu's son is targeted by the gangsters and is shot while walking on the beach. Rawale informs Sadhu that Rauf has done it. Sadhu nabs Rauf. He initially denies being the culprit but later accepts it. However, he also warns Sadhu that Rawale has been assigned the job of killing the righteous CM (Dilip Prabhawalkar) by someone, whom Sadhu trusts a lot. Before Rauf could give away the name, he gets shot by Thorat. The latter says he was ordered to do so. It is soon announced that Rawale would be returning to Mumbai and may join politics soon. Both Sadhu and Shalu suspects that the home minister is involved in the CM's assassination and was the one who took Rawale's help to plot the murder. Sadhu confronts the home minister and the later admits it, saying his political career wouldn't have taken off in the presence of the CM, who didn't favour him and his devious activities. He also dares Sadhu to expose him, having a firm opinion that no one would believe Sadhu. Sadhu decides to give up but Shalu tells him that she has found evidence against the home minister, a video proof of his meeting with Rawale but before she could pick up the CD, she gets shot by Thorat, who is now revealed to be the home minister's henchman. Sadhu arrives at nick of time and shoots Thorat dead before he can kill Shalu. Sadhu goes to an event, where the home minister is to pay tribute to the late CM. Sadhu steps on stage, requests he be given an opportunity to speak. After appreciating the Home Minister, he quickly moves towards him and stabs a sharp pen into his shoulder, thus killing him. The film continues at present time, where Commissioner Pradhan is shown interrogating Sadhu. As he leaves the room, Sadhu asks Pradhan to take care of Aman and it is implied that Aman is still alive. His death was merely faked to eliminate the underworld. An epilogue is shown where we are told that Sadhu was given life imprisonment for also killing Rawale in the same jail where both were imprisoned together.

He became the wealthiest cotton planter in the South prior to the American Civil War, and also invested in railroads and Midwest lands. He owned thousands of acres of land and more than 1,000 slaves in the 1850s , cultivating both cotton and sugar cane as commodity crops. In 1830 he and James Brown, a wealthy planter and US Senator from Louisiana, paid for the purchase of land in Canada to aid American free blacks from Cincinnati, Ohio found a new community, which became known as the Wilberforce Colony. In the 1830s, Duncan was also among the co-founders of the Mississippi Colonization Society in the 1830s, and helped purchase land in West Africa to create a colony as for relocation of free people of color from the state.

He moved from Natchez to New York City in 1863, where he had long had business interests. Ultimately, Duncan was what many of the northern planters from this time aspired to be, and was essential in perpetuating the connection between northern success and growth with southern networks of slavery.

Duncan sold his crops through the merchant firm Washington, Jackson & Co. in New Orleans, instructing them to sell it through their subsidiary Todd, Jackson & Co. in Liverpool, England. The revenue derived from the cotton and sugar sales was sent to Charles P. Leverich & Co., his bank headquartered in New York. His plantations yielded returns of US$150,000 annually. As a result of these financial transactions, Duncan became the richest cotton planter. In the 1850s, Duncan owned more than 1,000 slaves, making him the largest resident slave holder in Mississippi.'Plantation Economy', American Cotton Planter, N. B.

Colonization efforts  In 1830, Duncan, along with planter James Brown, a former sugar planter, US Minister to France and US Senator from Louisiana, purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) of land in the Huron Tract in Ontario, Canada, for a community of free American blacks.

In the 1830s, together with major slave owners Isaac Ross (1760-1838), Edward McGehee (1786-1880), John Ker (1789-1850), and educator Jemeriah Chamberlain (1794-1851), president of Oakland College, Duncan co- founded the Mississippi Colonization Society. Their goal was to relocate (repatriate) free blacks and newly freed slaves to the developing colony of Liberia on the African continent.Mary Carol Miller, Lost Mansions of Mississippi, Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2010, Volume II, pp. 53-54 The organization was modeled after the American Colonization Society, but it focused on freedmen from Mississippi. They bought a portion of land for the colony. Free blacks were thought to threaten the stability of slave societies, and Mississippi's population had a majority of slaves, outnumbering whites by a three-to-one ratio. Ross offered freedslaves in his will if they would relocate to Africa; after challenges, in the late 1840s about 300 of his slaves were relocated to Mississippi-in-Africa, as the colony was called. The Mississippi colony eventually became part of what developed as Liberia.  American Civil War and postbellum career  During the Civil War, Duncan opposed secession and the Confederate States Army. As a result, he was ostracized by other Southerners. With investments worth $1 0 unrelated to his plantations, he would be able to live comfortably regardless of the outcome of the war. In 1863, Duncan left Natchez, moving to New York City.  Personal life  Duncan married Margaret Ellis, and they had two children together, John Ellis and Sarah Jane Duncan. After his wife died, Duncan married again in 1819, to Catherine A. Bingaman. They had four children: Stephen Jr.; Charlotte N., M. L., and Henry P. Duncan.

She has worked as a journalist and anthropologist and is also known for her active philanthropy in social work, humanitarian issues, and the applied arts. right Early career Stahl spent her childhood in Los Angeles, California and later moved to New York where she attended the Dalton School. She then studied painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1968-1972); the Institute Allende in San Miguel, Mexico (1978); and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine (1979). In 1979 she returned to New York and in 1982 joined COLAB (Collaborative Projects) a movement dedicated to furthering the critical social function of art in opposition to the galloping forces of commercialization and urban gentrification. She transferred her paintings and drawings to small ‚Äúmultiples‚Äù such as plastic shopping bags, gravestone-rubbing placemats, and jigsaw puzzles that became part of an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúThe A. More Store.‚Äù The exhibit parodied the senseless commodification of the fine arts and appeared from 1982‚Äì84 at Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Artists Space, ABC No Rio, and the Jack Tilton Gallery, and Printed Matter in New York. This exhibition featured inexpensive works by some 150 artists, including then unknowns Tom Otterness, Kiki Smith, Jenny Holzer, and Barbara Kruger.Alan W. Moore and Marc Miller, eds., ABC No Rio Dinero: The Story of a Lower East Side Art Gallery, (Collaborative Projects (Colab), NY, 1985). Painting \\"The Genie's Out of the Bottle\\" (2002) Watercolor & Collage on paper Stahl's early paintings were large oil portraits of her friends and fellow artists. Some canvases depicted bathers on Atlantic coast beaches. Other paintings attested to a fascination with books as objects that would recur in her Polaroid photography. The oils were exhibited in one-woman shows: ‚ÄúArtists Choose Artists‚Äù at Artists Space (New York), ‚ÄúPaintings in Praise of Joan Didion‚Äù at Atlantic Gallery (Boston) and ‚ÄúSeated Bathers‚Äù at Merrimack College (Massachusetts). Beginning a period of extensive travel and journalistic work in 1985 Stahl took up aquarelle and collage as a more portable medium suitable for recording the variations of color and light in distant lands. While conducting ethnographic fieldwork in West Africa in 1991, she began collecting colons, vernacular wooden sculptures depicting African men and women in non-traditional jobs as seamstresses, dentists, attorneys, medical doctors, soldiers, filmmakers, race car drivers, and colonial administrators.Eliane Girard and Brigitte Kernel, Colons, Statuettes Habill√©es D‚ÄôAfrique De L‚ÄôOuest, (Paris: Syros Alternatives, 1993). Originally, these tribal objects embodied a ritual negotiation of the political and social vicissitudes of early 20th century colonial life in French West Africa.Fritz Kramer, The Red Fez, Art and Spirit Possession in Africa, (New York: Verso, 1993). They symbolized the growing secularization of modernist development and a vested, yet ever ambiguous indigenous power versus the global cash economy.Philip Ravenhill, Dreams and Reveries, Images of Other World Mates Among the Baule, West Africa, (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1996).Robert Farris Thompson, Flash of the Spirit, (New York: Vintage, 1984). Once discovered by foreign travelers the colons entered into circulation ironically as commodities for tourists seeking ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô African souvenirs,Christopher B. Steiner, African Art in Transit, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.) hence Stahl's fascination at discovering an organized artistic dissidence evoking themes similar to those she explored in Colab's ‚ÄúA. More Store.‚Äù \\"House Call, Bellevue Ave.\\" (2011) Plywood, Pittsburgh paint, molding and colon figure Her watercolors amplified these ironies by inviting the colons into the spaces and narratives of European Renaissance art. The startling juxtapositions were a trenchant commentary on global inequalities ‚Äì virtual African tourists at the celebrated monuments of Western arts and culture, consuming their exploiters‚Äô food and wine, appropriating their religious icons, meeting them face-to-face on the level playing field of artistic imagination. In exploring these themes Stahl resuscitated the moribund still-life painting style. She often embellished her paintings with collage and encaustic to secure a tactile bond among disparate compositional elements against background simulacra of Dutch wax print cottons, fusing modern & traditional motifs. Her extraordinarily dense works were the subject of a series of exhibitions from 1999-2006 including ‚ÄúColon Watercolors‚Äù at the Museum for African Art, NY; ‚ÄúMise en Place‚Äù at Lori Bookstein Gallery, NY; ‚ÄúTuscan Travelogue and Other Watercolors‚Äù at the Palazzo Pretorio, San Donato, Italy; ‚ÄúThe Genie‚Äôs Out of the Bottle‚Äù at Lori Bookstein Gallery, NY; ‚ÄúBricolage‚Äù at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Greenwich, CT; ‚ÄúPrima Luce‚Äù at Hudson Guild Gallery, NY; and ‚ÄúWatercolors‚Äù at Lori Bookstein Gallery, NY. Responding to the Great Collapse of the housing market in 2008 Stahl began contemplating ideas of home in depictions of single-family houses and high-rise urban apartments. She created this new subject matter appropriately with latex house paints on wood scraps retrieved from housing construction sites. In several instances her colons reappear, visiting the Gilded Age mansions of Newport, Rhode Island as witnesses to the destructive havoc of overwrought economic speculation. This time, however, the African carvings are literally hewn and glued to the scene, presumably to add materiality to the ephemeral luxuries of the super-rich. These paintings debuted in a 2014 exhibition entitled ‚ÄúHome Economics‚Äù at the Hudson Guild Gallery part of New York's oldest settlement house. The show also featured sculpture by Tom Otterness and photographs by Todd Hido. In early 2016 Stahl exhibited her newest collection of painting assemblages entitled \\"Wayfarers and Warblers\\" at the [Hudson Guild Gallery.\\"Barbeque at the Temple of Athena\\" (2015) Reclaimed wood, Pittsburgh paint, mosaic, fabricPerhaps her most daring work yet, \\"Wayfarers and Warblers‚Äù is an artistic coup, a flight of fancy, taking the viewer on a space-time detour to improbable yet possible dimensions of history and geography. Her assemblages tell stories by fusing particular (archaeological) fragments, fictive moments, and other heterogeneous elements into an act of narration that invites us to escape present circumstances without, for all that, ignoring their deeper origins. Stahl's painting employs the creative techniques of quotation and inversion by mediating a catalog of Greco-Roman ruins, the perambulations of modern tourists, the politically incorrect fantasies of hobbyists, and finally the practice of bird watching (ornithology). The resulting compositions are an unending summation of places and cultures merged into fictional ‚Äòevents‚Äô in uncertain futures or alternative pasts. Native American tourists, Ancient Egyptian jet-setters, globe-trotting Bedouins. Why not! Their messages mimic the cryptic postcards of mid-century travelers, too busy like real ornithologists absorbing the fleeting movement of a rare bird to worry much about the kids back home. In each tableau the artist executes her painterly gestures while fidgeting with odd wooden scraps as the decisive interventions needed to harmonize the scene. These scraps organize our memory by providing a framework for the art- historical knowledge that reveals itself in an instant when the right strokes are completed. This is the instance of art, the moment when talent and a sense of intellectual tactics converge to balance the real with the imagined. Sculpture \\"Cezanne Smoker\\"(2010) Terracotta During the first decade of the 21st century Stahl carried her interests in narrative into the realm of terracotta reliefs where she revisits classical and modern depictions of Bible stories and myths. Sometimes using glazes or oil paint she reanimates the works of C√©zanne, Chardin, Durer, Degas, Beckmann, Balthus, Gauguin, Picasso, Piero della Francesca, Titian, and Mantegna. The collection recapitulates the narrative of Western art history while demonstrating a simultaneous command of mixed media in a burst of hues, colors, and fired textures. Examples appeared in 2011 alongside the reliefs of Natalie Charnoff, Jock Ireland, and Cynthia Harmon in ‚ÄúRelief: Drawing in Depth‚Äù at the Hudson Guild Gallery. Prints and textiles Her earliest silkscreen prints were part of a COLAB project and also printed original inserts for the East Village literary publication, Between C & D Magazine in 1984.Joel Rose, Between C & D: New Writing from the Lower East Side Fiction Magazine, (New York: Penguin, 1987). With Andrea Callard, a New York artist and filmmaker, she co-founded the Avocet Portfolio printmaking studio at Art Awareness in the Catskill Mountain town of Lexington, New York. With a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, Avocet ran a two-year summer retreat (1985‚Äì86) where visiting artists, Becky Howland, Kiki Smith, and Richard Tobias contributed to a portfolio of fine art prints. Stahl's own prints were made from rubbings of early American gravestones and featured many classical motifs. In addition to making paper silkscreen prints, she experimented with cotton textile productions, the results of which were presented to the annual meeting of the American Gravestone Society in early 1987. Later Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, an avant- garde Parisian designer purchased these textiles for his collection, commenting, ‚ÄúYou Americans are so preoccupied with finality.‚Äù Stahl's fascination with West African arts extended to textiles, principally the syncretic, profane, and whimsical motifs featured in wax print cottons. She turned examples from her collection into apparel and also incorporated them into her paintings. Photography Many of her early oil portraits were made from Polaroid SX-70 photos of her friends, fellow artists, and others. Some of these works were acquired by the permanent collection of the Polaroid Corporation. From that moment she became a devotee of this medium making abstract photos of books exhibited as ‚ÄúBooks: The Physical Evidence‚Äù in 2012 at the Hudson Guild Gallery. Polaroid went bankrupt in 2001 and stopped producing its instant film in 2009, yet Stahl continues to experiment with the medium using SX-70 compatible film manufactured by Polaroid Originals. Stahl began work as a documentary photographer in 1985 using 35-mm black & white and color film in SLR and Rangefinder cameras. She worked as freelance photojournalist covering the armed resistance to the covert American military operations in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and the U.S.-backed fascist contras in Honduras; the popular rebellion against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines; the Moro National Liberation Front separatist movement in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago;‚ÄúBangsa Moro!

This case is still currently ongoing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is the latest in a series of attempts by CW to revoke one of the three patents held by WARF on hESCs. Background On January 20, 1995, James Thomson filed an initial application for patent rights based on his pioneering work in isolating and maintaining long-lived culture of primate and human embryonic stem cells.Thomson JA, Kalishman J, Golos TG, Durning M, Harris CP, Becker RA, Hearn JP. ‚ÄúIsolation of a primate embryonic stem cell line.‚Äù Proc.

As a result of this filing, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) eventually issued three patents to Thomson, which were all later assigned to WARF: U.S. Patents Nos. 5,843,780 (December 1, 1998),Thomson, JA. ‚ÄúPrimate Embryonic Stem Cells.‚Äù U.S. Patent 5,843,780. 1 December 1998. 6,200,806 (March 13, 2001),Thomson, JA. ‚ÄúPrimate Embryonic Stem Cells.‚Äù U.S. Patent 6,200,806. 13 March 2001. and 7,029,913 (April 18, 2006).Thomson, JA. ‚ÄúPrimate Embryonic Stem Cells.‚Äù U.S. Patent 7,029,913. 18 April 2006. These patents are commonly referred to as the ‚Äò780, ‚Äò806, and ‚Äò913 patents, respectively, and are all entitled ‚ÄúPrimate Embryonic Stem Cells.‚Äù Timeline of Events On July 18, 2006, CW (then known as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights) along with the Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) filed formal requests with the USPTO to revoke the ‚Äò780, ‚Äò806, and ‚Äò913 patents on the grounds that the patents are overreaching and ‚Äúsignificantly undermine research and waste taxpayer money‚Äù.\\"Groups Challenge Stem Cell Patents That Loot Taxpayer Funds and Force Research Overseas.\\" PUBPAT News. 18 July 2006. Web. 08 Apr. 2014. The main impetus for these appeals was that CW, which is a nonprofit advocacy group based in Santa Monica, California, claimed that the patent unfairly drove up the cost of research by requiring companies and academic institutions to pay a licensing fee for use of any human embryonic cell lines. Many believe that the timing of this appeal was a direct response to the increasing licensing costs paid by California taxpayers with the rise of state-funded stem cell research programs, specifically the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM).Golden JM. ‚ÄúWARF‚Äôs Stem Cell Patents and Tensions between Public and Private Sector Approaches to Research.‚Äù Journal of Law Medicine & Ethics. 2010; 38 (2): 314‚Äì331. In October 2006, the USPTO granted the request for re-examination of all three patents due to ‚Äúsubstantial new questions‚Äù regarding the validity of WARF‚Äôs claims. In response to the re- examination proceedings, WARF eased their licensing restrictions by allowing academic researchers to now freely share WARF hESCs without incurring fees and removing the licensing requirements for companies funding research at universities and other nonprofit institutions.Gulbrandsen, C. ‚ÄúWARF's licensing policy for ES cell lines.‚Äù Nat Biotechnology. 2007; 25, 387. On April 2, 2007, the USPTO released its decision to uphold the challenges for all three stem cell patents, agreeing with CW‚Äôs original claim that Thomson‚Äôs work was ‚Äúobvious in light of previous scientific research.‚Äù In response to the USPTO findings, WARF further narrowed their patent claims to only include stem cells derived from ‚Äúpre-implantation embryos.‚Äù This narrowed claim was eventually granted by USPTO in February and March 2008 for all three patents.Vanden Plas, Joe. \\"Patent Office Upholds Remaining WARF Stem Cell Patents.\\" WTN News.

Since the re- examinations of the ‚Äò780 and ‚Äò806 patents were both ex parte (in contrast to the re-examination of the ‚Äò913 patent which was inter partes), this final decision on the ‚Äò780 and ‚Äò806 patents could not be appealed.

Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. 13-1377. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 2013. In this appeal, CW reiterated their previous arguments, that the work done was too similar to earlier research on mouse embryonic cells and applying it to human cells was an obvious next step to anyone skilled in the field. Furthermore, they referenced the June 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics that determined human genes can‚Äôt be patented because they are a ‚Äúproduct of nature.‚Äù CW argued that hESC culture falls within this ‚Äúproduct of nature‚Äù clause. On January 17, 2014, the USPTO responded to a request by the Federal Circuit panel concerning CW‚Äôs standing in this case. The USPTO argued that CW had no actual standing to appeal the USPTO‚Äôs decision to uphold the patent as CW lacks any ‚Äúconcrete or particularized interest‚Äù in the issue at hand and failed to show any ‚Äúinjury or harm‚Äù to justify an appeal. As such, the USPTO concluded that the federal court has no judicial power to render judgment in this case because it does not satisfy the requirements for jurisdiction as specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. On January 27, 2014, WARF filed a statement in support of USPTO‚Äôs arguments. On the same day, CW responded to the USPTO‚Äôs conclusions by re-asserting their standing even in the absence of specific injury by citing several court cases as precedent. On June 4, 2014, the Federal Circuit dismissed CW‚Äôs appeal. In 2015 all 3 patents expired. Implications and Future Outlook Ultimately, the impact of this case on hESC research remains hard to determine. There does not currently seem to be much concern in the scientific community regarding this case, with no real strong national push either for or against this appeal compared to other scientific issues. One of the most vocal supporters of this appeal has been Jeanne Loring,Loring, J. \\"A Patent Challenge for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research.\\" Nature Reports Stem Cells. 2007. a prominent stem cell researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. One possible reason for this apparent lack of concern within the scientific community is that WARF has eased its licensing fees and restrictions to such an extent that most don‚Äôt find the overall cost of hESC lines exorbitantly high compared to other cell lines. Also, work on human embryonic stem cell research has been mitigated to a certain extent due to uncertainty about future federal funding and ongoing ethical concerns of such research. Moreover, with the recent discovery of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells,Takahashi K, Yamanaka S. ‚ÄúInduction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.‚Äù Cell. 2006; 126: 663‚Äì676. many scientists in the field have shifted towards iPS cells for precisely the reasons just stated. Finally, with all of the WARF patents due to expire in 2015,Decker, S. \\"Gene Patent Case Fuels U.S. Court Test of Stem Cell Right.\\" Bloomberg.com. Bloomberg, 6 Jan. 2014. Web. 26 Mar. 2014. it seems unlikely that the resolution of this case, or any possible future litigation about the ‚Äò913 patent in particular, will have a significant effect on hESC research. Perhaps more significantly, the ruling of this case may set an important precedent on determining intellectual property rights for biological entities and the extent to which the term ‚Äúproduct of nature‚Äù can be applied. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics established that ‚Äúproducts of nature‚Äù such as human genes, despite the tremendous research efforts made to isolate them, cannot be patented. If the challenge to WARF‚Äôs ‚Äò913 patent were to succeed, this could lead to more widespread invalidation of other bio-related patents. From an economic standpoint, this could have broad implications in the biotechnology area by scaring away venture capitalists and other investors who may feel they don‚Äôt have adequate protection for their investments, possibly resulting in an overall decline in innovation in the field.Marshall, E. \\"Historic Patent on Embryonic Stem Cells Faces Scrutiny.\\" Science. 2014; 343.6169.359.

Children fought on both sides of the conflict. Nearly half of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and a quarter of the governmental armed forces consisted of children aged 8‚Äì14 years old.  Background  During the decade-long civil conflict which took place in Sierra Leone between 1991 and 2002, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), state forces and state-supported militias conscripted children for use in combat. Although the use of children in combat is not new to Sierra Leone, the use of child soldiers became widespread during the civil war. The RUF kidnapped and forced children to fight from when the civil conflict began, and up to eighty percent of their numbers were aged from seven to fourteen and served in the Small Boys Unit. The state's armed forces, and the militia groups which supported them, also recruited children, which led to an estimated 10,000 children taking part in the conflict. According to Myriam Denov, up to 30 percent of the children in the RUF were girls. These girls were subject to rape, gang rape and other forms of sexual violence. The memories should be their punishment, Radio Netherlands Archives, January 12, 2000 The RUF used alcohol and hallucinogenic drugs on children during training, according to a former RUF commander: > We were very much aware of the effects of drugs on children. Drugs and > alcohol were prevalent and served as [a] prerequisite for combat activities. > Fighting with a gun is not an easy task because it puts so much pressure on > the mind. So we needed to free the mind by taking drugs, and it worked. The RUF was known for being exceptionally brutal; beheadings, maiming, and mutilation of victims was commonplace. The group has been heavily criticized by human rights groups for their forced conscription of children to use as combatants, their sexual exploitation of children and using children for forced labor. These children were forced to commit murders, rapes, sexual slavery, mutilations and other forms of human rights abuses.Innocence Lost, Radio Netherlands Archives, February 16, 2000  Causes Leading to Child Soldiers  The rise of the child soldier in Sierra Leone is a product of both socio-economic conditions prior to the war, and the growth of human rights violations during the war. Initial recruitment of children was possible because of the acceptance of children in the workforce, and then grew to a crisis as the RUF and state militias abducted children into conscription. Economic conditions in Sierra Leone are traditionally poor. Primary agrarian, many families enlisted the help of their children to provide income for families. = Youth In Sierra Leone = In her book, Childhood Deployed, Susan Shepler argues the concept of youth in Sierra Leone is distinct from idealized western distinctions of childhood. Specifically, given the generally poor and agrarian economy in Sierra Leone, youth labor is normalized. Many children are forced into the labor market as a condition of necessity, working for their families or for others as a means to collect income for their family. Beyond the family unit, the concept of apprenticeships, or fostering of young children by people other than their biological parents is common. Children were often hired by adults to assist them in their trade, or act as helpers: cooking, cleaning, and running errands. Political conditions also amplified the prevalence of children in the workforce as child services were underfunded and often non-existent, leaving children with a lack access to education. Street children, or children with no family unit or apprenticeships, were a primary target for early recruitment by the RUF. Early tactics included the promise of education and provisions such as food and clothing to street children. Shepler argues that cultural acceptance of youth in the labor pool was a catalyst for children's recruitment into the RUF. Children first acted as workers within military units, carrying out non-combative tasks, and later, acceptance of children in the ranks grew due to their inconspicuous nature. Children were used to bypass enemy lines and relay messages across battle zones. = Coercion and Abduction = Early in the war, recruitment focused on those children whose family structures were poor or absent, promising protection and a sense of community. Much effort was given to play to the resentment children had about their situations, or about loss of family they may have endured due to the war. This resentment was exploited by the RUF who promised retaliation for lost family members and an opportunity to be part of something. The coercive effects of adults in recruiting children to violence has parallels to broader patrimonial structures within the armed forces. Children are recruited and socialized as clients of \\"big men.\\" However, as ranks depleted, the RUF resorted to forced abductions. Children were taken from their homes, often their families were assaulted or murdered. Fear became a primary means of enlisting children to fight. Reintegration of Child Soldiers Article 39 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that \\"parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child of victim of...armed conflicts. Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child\\"., UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 39. Reintegration programs are facilitated within a human rights framework by non-governmental and governmental organizations. They primarily focus on the needs of the child and often fail to adequately prepare families for receiving and facilitating reintegration of the victim. =Primary Organisations Facilitating Reintegration Programs= The United Nations The United Nations (UIN) was influential in ending the hostilities in Sierra Leone. They established the peace-keeping mission, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), who assisted the Government of Sierra Leone in implementing the Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) method. The objective of the DDR is to \\"contribute security and stability in post-conflict environments so that recovery and development can begin\\". , Integrated Disarmament, Demobolization and Reintegration Standards. This system is used in coordination with other political and reconstruction mechanisms to ensure that long-term sustainable reintegration support is provided and to prevent Sierra Leone returning to violent conflict. In March 2004 the Secretary-General of the United Nations proposed that UNAMSIL's mandate be extended to December 2005 due to the fragile nature of the state's Government and concern that they were not ready to assume responsibility for the country's security. , The Child Soldiers Global Report 2004.

UNICEF provided protection for demobilized children within their interim care centres (ICC) whilst they conducted family tracing exercises to achieve reunification. 5038 demobilized child soldiers passed through these centres before their closure. They also assisted in tracing the families of 2166 children who had not been associated with armed conflict. , The Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration of Child Soldiers: Social and Psychological Transformation in Sierra Leone.

Where ex-soldiers were not able to be reunited with their families or communities, UNICEF was able to provide them with foster homes., UNICEF Fact Sheet on Child Soldiers. GOAL Goal is a non-governmental organisation based in Ireland which is funded by UNICEF. GOAL. It operates specifically in Freetown and its reintegration approach is focused on providing informal education, social work, advocacy and health care initiatives to male ex-combatants who are under 18 years old and female victims of sexual abuse. In some cases they have been confronted with difficulty in attracting female victims to attend informal educational classes. To address this issue, GOAL started distributing food packages to those who attended these programs. Forum for African Women's Educationalists Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) provides education for females across Africa, including in Freetown Sierra Leone. Their first project was established in 1999 and offered victims of sexual exploitation access to medical and psychological clinics. They further expanded this program through establishing community sensitisation services focused on enabling the reintegration of females with babies who were the product of sexual violation during conflict. These services were implemented through ensuring the accessibility of health care, education and skills training.War rape in Sierra Leone, Radio Netherlands Archives, January 12, 2000 National Commission for Social Action The National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) is a mandate of the Government Sierra Leone. It provides for reconstruction and relief and focuses on providing development which enables sustainable reintegration. It has established three specific programs: a community based program, public works program and micro finance program. It has played a pivotal role in re-establishing local governments. =The Focus Of These Facilitators= These organisations primarily include access to:, Community Based Psychosocial and Economic Reintegration in Sierra Leone. *Psychosocial support and care *Family reunification *Skills based training *Health care *Education *Vocational training These programs focus on establishing long-term support networks and reintegration schemes which can continue to sustainably function without the long-term assistance from the third party organisations previously discussed. This long-term vision requires political, economic and social support. =The \\"DDR\\" Method= The process of DDR is broken down into four stages: * Disarmament: involves collecting, controlling and disposing of weapons and ammunition associated with civilians and combatants. It also creates responsible arms management mechanisms. *Demobilization: is the process of formally discharging active combatants from the armed forces or other armed rebel groups they have been associated with. This is a two part journey; part one being the processing of soldiers and part two involves reinsertion of combatants. This process concerns providing assistance to ex-soldiers during the demobilisation phase prior to reintegrating them into society, which is the long-term goal. This assistance is crucial as it satisfies their short-term needs; it predominantly comes in the forms of: clothing, shelter, food, education, employment and health care. *Reintegration: is the final stage which enables ex-soldiers to obtain civilian status within the community through reintegrating them economically and socially. This involves entering into sustainable income and employment opportunities which will enable these individuals to support themselves. The Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration method has been facilitated by 17,500 peace-keepers., United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone Factsheet. The initial program was concluded on the 31st of December 2003 and it was estimated that 6,845 ex-soldiers had been demobilised by 2002 and reunified with their families. Female victims equated to an estimated 529 of these children. In February 2004, the Sierra Leone Government stated that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone program was complete. It had processed over 75,000 combatants, which included 4,651 women., United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone Fact Sheet. It was estimated that nearly 55,000 ex-fighters were given access to the integration benefits previously discussed. Another 3000 children were involved in community programs organised by UNICEF and 12,000 ex-fighters were processed through formal education schemes. The 'DDR' program was adapted in 2006 to formally become the Integrated DDR Standards (IDDRS). =Issues Arising During Reintegration= Psychological Issues Militant groups including the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) subjected these child soldiers to training methods which hardened them through making them immune to violence. They were taught that this type of heinous behaviour and ideological thinking was a normalised process and they were not allowed to demonstrate remorse for their actions. The RUF instilled the notion that the soldiers should never return home because of the violent atrocities they had carried out against their families and communities. , The Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration of Child Soldiers: Social and Psychological Transformation in Sierra Leone. This invoked severe psychological effects including: anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, hostility and aggression on many of the victims., Child Soldiers in Sierra Leone: Experiences, Implications and Strategies for Rehabilitation and Community Reintegration. However, not all ex-combatants have suffered from these medical issues; some have demonstrated resilient social and mental health functions. Communication Issues Concerning The Victim's Family In some cases victims struggled to communicate their feelings due to the guilt, shame and stigma attached to their experiences. In these situations the severity of their communicative problems were dependent on the victims age, gender and role in the conflict. Issues relating to the communication between victims and their families concerning the severity of the soldiers adolescent experiences were evident during the reintegration process. This issue stemmed from the failure of reintegration programs to successfully prepare and provide caregivers with sufficient preparation for the victims return. These programs tended to focus primarily on the child. It was evident that where caregivers were unable to monitor and understand the severity of the victims exposure to violence, it heavily affected the child's ability to reintegrate into the community. \\"Re-Victimization\\" Re-victimization was prevalent within communities in post-conflict Sierra Leone, particularly during support processes and within community reintegration. It is widely recognised that it was more prevalent for females to be subjected to community rejection. Social and economic marginalisation between former female and male combatants was rife. An estimated 1000 women and girls were excluded from DDR programs and are believed to have been living with former rebel combatants., The Twenty- First Report of the UN Secretary-General on the UN Mission in Sierra Leone. Females were commonly denied access to DDR programs because of the requirement to hand in a weapon to qualify for assistance. In a UNICEF survey, 46% of those surveyed referenced this as their reason for being excluded from assistance. , US AID Reintegration of Child Soldiers in Sierra Leone. Females often did not have access to weapons when they were recruited for roles involving: sexual labour, cooking and porter assistance. Negative stigma and alienation within communities was frequently experienced by girls who were victims of brutal sexual encounters including Gang rape, violence and \\"AK-47 Marriages\\" or \\"Bush Marriages\\". These females were labelled as \\"unmarriageable\\" because of their exposure to sexual exploitation which often resulted in them losing their virginity before marriage. These girls were also associated with being carriers of HIV and STI's. This label forced females to be excluded socially and economically. As a result of this \\"re-victimization\\" it was common for these females to have no choice but to stay with their rebel \\"husbands\\" in order to survive or choose prostitution to generate disposable income to support themselves. In response to this exclusion, UNICEF established the 'Girls Left Behind Project' which focused on: appropriating services to 1000 females, tracing 65% of their families, educating communities to ensure they did not suffer from further exploitations. Avoidance of DDR Programs Some ex-RUF children have evaded the DDR process because they fear that they will be criminally prosecuted for their involvements with the atrocities committed by the RUF and be victims to the negative stigmatisation attached to their actions. Where children avoid assistance they are often left with no newly acquired skills or financial benefits and are forced to support themselves. Often these individuals become involved with commercial sex labour, crime and drug exploitation to ensure survival.  Legal proceedings  According to legal scholar Sandesh Sivakumaran, the special court has provided needed clarification over the use of children in combat, and had identified certain actions which could be deemed as illegal with regards to the use of children in combat. In 2007 the special court passed the first convictions for war crimes during the conflict. Three members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) were found guilty of various human rights abuses, which included the recruitment of children for use in combat.

The Trade Directories for Devonshire from 1851 to 1939 state that Charles Dunn was followed by Henry Passmore, then Henry Alford, then John Nicholas Reed and just before World War II, the Bowden Brothers. All of these were farmers at Ash Barton.North Devon Record Office (NDRO): Land Tax Records 1780‚Äì1832 Document: 48/25/9/4 The chapel A 16th century mural monument (see image above) to the Bellew family of Ash survives on the south wall of St Brannock's Church in Braunton and is said to have been taken from the old chapel at Ash.Coulter, J. 1993: Ancient Chapels of North Devon, Barnstaple. In the mid-19th century, the local historian Harding mentioned in his notes regarding Ash ‚Äòan ancient chapel still standing‚Äô. Coulter says Coulter, J. 1993: Ancient Chapels of North Devon, Barnstaple ‚Äòthe large, detached building to the rear of the main residence is thought by some to be the old chapel, but there is no particular evidence or architectural feature to support this.‚Äô Although it would not be at all unusual for a high status residence at some distance from the parish church to have a private chapel, no licence for a chapel here has been found. Furthermore, despite local belief, the respondent to Dean Milles‚Äô questionnaire of c. 1750 West Country Studies Library (WCSL): Dean Milles Questionnaire. Ordnance Survey Surveyor‚Äôs Draft 1805. Ordnance Survey First Edition map at 1:2500 1889 Devon sheet 8:12 made no mention of any chapel here either extant or ruined. Harding‚Äôs words are at present the only historic documentary reference, and so without more positive evidence, the question of a former chapel must remain open. Surroundings The Ash Barton Estate lies beyond the boundary of the extensive area of long, narrow fields seen on the Braunton tithe map. These represent the engrossment and enclosure of the plough strips of medieval open field agriculture of which the Braunton Great Field is a rare surviving example. The system appears to have been bounded by Buttercombe Lane, which may represent a ‚Äòtranshumance‚Äô route taking livestock to graze on the high ground of Fullabrook Down. To the south and east of Buttercombe Lane is an area of probably late medieval enclosure of what may have been the occasionally cultivated outfield. The Devon County Historic Landscape Characterisation survey describes the fields around Ash Barton as 15th- to 18th-century enclosures possibly based to an extent on medieval boundaries. The occurrence of the term ‚ÄòGratton‚Äô in the names of two fields - tithe map numbers 1136 and 1138 - immediately to the east of the Ash Barton Estate may confirm this. The term is interpreted by Gover, Mawer and Stenton Gover, J., Mawer, A. & Stenton, F. 1932: The Place-Names of Devon, Part 2 as ‚Äòstubble field‚Äô, but it is so common across Devon that it seems to have greater and more permanent significance than the seasonal ‚Äòarish‚Äô. More likely it is descriptive of the outfield onto which stock would be turned to graze in between brief periods of cultivation. This would suggest that the settlement at Ash was established when the infield-outfield system had fallen away, perhaps relatively late in the pre-Conquest period. To the north west is a field numbered 1133 on the tithe map and called in the tithe apportionment ‚ÄòLower Forches‚Äô. This belongs within a group of ‚ÄòForches‚Äô field names here centring on a small triangle of land beside Buttercombe Lane called ‚ÄòForches Green‚Äô. Here in the medieval period would have stood the gallows. Today The estate is now owned and operated as a multi-purpose self-catering venue for hire by the Daukes family including weddings, parties, family holidays and corporate gatherings. www.ashbarton.com References External links The Ash Barton Estate Website Grade II* listed houses Houses in Devon Grade II* listed buildings in Devon Historic estates in Devon Braunton ","title":"Ash, Braunton"},{"id":"42446453","text":"The Old Brethren are a group of Schwarzenau Brethren who split from the Old German Baptist Brethren in Carroll County, Indiana (Deer Creek), in 1913, and in Stanislaus County, California, in 1915. They are a believer's church made up of those who voluntarily choose to follow Jesus as His disciples, and are baptized at this time, during their teen or adult years.  History  The issue which is often given as cause for division in the early 1900s was the changes brought by quick acceptance of telephones and automobiles among the Old German Baptist Brethren. Generally, the more conservative Old Brethren originally wanted more uniform adherence to Annual Meeting decisions. Ultimately the Old Brethren chose to uphold the older form of Annual Meeting, which was simpler and more Scripture based than the legislative business model which had recently developed among the Old German Baptist Brethren. Attempts in 1929-30 to reunite the Old Brethren and Old German Baptist Brethren were not successful. After 1930, the Old Brethren placed less stress on Annual Meeting authority than did the parent body, believing it to be a simple gathering more for edification, fellowship and teaching, than for legislation. Personal conviction and moral persuasion to follow the Bible are now the basis for adherence to the church's order, rather than legislative decisions of Annual Meeting. In 1939, those Old Brethren who wished to stress following legislative decisions of Annual Meeting and also to maintain the rejection of automobiles, telephones, electricity and tractors formed a more conservative traditional group, called the Old Brethren German Baptists.The Brethren Encyclopedia, Vol. II, Donald F. Durnbaugh, editor (1983) The Brethren Encyclopedia Inc. pages 964/5.  Religious practice  The Old Brethren do not use the German language in worship any longer, neither a German dialect in everyday life nor High German for Bible and church readings, because they had already given up the everyday use of the German language when the first split of conservatives from the main body of German Baptist Brethren occurred in the 1880s. They have given up horse and buggy transportation and accepted the use of automobiles, while they have retained plain dress. The Old Brethren prefer to allow time and space for the Holy Spirit to guide a person's life. Brotherly counsel according to Matthew 18 and other Scripture is also followed. Teachings of the New Testament are interpreted and applied literally, especially those in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7.) They have less rules than the German Baptist Brethren, preferring to let the Holy Spirit convict hearts and lead people to live holy lives, according to the Scriptures. Old Brethren are more plain in dress and more conservative in lifestyle than their parent group, the Old German Baptist Brethren; but are similar to them in many other aspects such as nonresistance, using the Trine Immersion mode of baptism and the three-part communion service including feetwashing and a love feast.Donald B. Kraybill, C. Nelson Hostetter: \\"Anabaptist World USA\\", Scottdale PA, 2001, page 155.  Members and congregations  In 1980 the Old Brethren numbered about 230 adult members.

Alex Hribal, a 16-year-old sophomore at the school, used a pair of eight-inch kitchen knives to stab and slash 20 students and a security guard. Four students sustained life-threatening injuries, but all survived. Details At around 7:13 a.m., minutes before classes began, Hribal, wearing black clothing, began stabbing and slashing students in the school's first- floor science hallway. After stabbing several people, Hribal pulled a fire alarm, attempting to bring more students out into the hallway, according to witness testimony and surveillance footage. Hribal, who witnesses said looked \\"emotionless\\" during the attack, wounded 20 students and a security guard before he was subdued by Sam King, the school's assistant principal, with the help of student Ian Griffith. While he was being restrained by King, Hribal reportedly refused to drop the knives, saying, \\"My work is not done. I have more people to kill.\\"School Stab-Spree Suspect Alex Hribal Planned to Kill, Cops Say, NBC News, April 25, 2014.\\"Teen stabs 22 at Pittsburgh-area high school\\" Aftermath A total of 22 people, including Hribal, were injured during the rampage. Officials said Hribal did not appear to have targeted any specific person. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) treated twelve patients. UPMC officials stated that two boys were in critical condition, two boys were in serious condition, and a boy and two girls were in fair condition. One victim was placed on a ventilator after a knife pierced his liver, while another suffered an open wound to the face that required 11 stitches. The teenage victims ranged in age from 14 to 17.Begos, Kevin. Police: Pa. student flashed 2 knives, injured 20, Associated Press, April 9, 2014. Eight other patients were taken to Forbes Regional Hospital in nearby Monroeville. Several of those victims had suffered serious injuries, including \\"deep wounds to the abdomen\\", according to hospital officials. In addition to the stabbing victims, two other students suffered unrelated injuries while fleeing the school. Hribal was treated for injuries to his hand. On May 18, 2014, Greg Keener, the last of the victims, was discharged from Forbes Regional Hospital. Franklin Regional High School was closed for several days while workers from a restoration company cleaned up. On April 14, classes resumed at the school. On April 9, 2015, Murrysville marked the one-year anniversary of the stabbing rampage. Several local churches held worship services that night. Perpetrator Alex Hribal (born October 1, 1997), a sophomore who has been described as \\"really shy,\\" was taken into custody after the stabbing as the suspected perpetrator. He has also been described as \\"quiet,\\" \\"smart\\" and as having \\"a good future ahead of him.\\" He alleged that he was depressed, had suicidal thoughts during the fifth grade, and that those emotions returned while he was attending Franklin Regional High School. He was believed by police to have threatened at least two students by phone prior to the rampage, but neither student was one of the victims. Officials have declared that Hribal was responsible for the stabbing, that he stabbed people in multiple classrooms, and that he used two \\"straight knives\\", measuring 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.4 cm), to carry it out. According to testimony, Hribal had begun planning the attack on September 22, 2013. Several items belonging to Hribal were seized from his home, including a notebook with writing in it and a knife holder assumed to have held the two knives used in the attack. A cellphone was also seized from Hribal's school locker, as was a note dated April 6, which read, \\"I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that isn't a plebian .\\" On June 10, 2014, a warrant was unsealed which stated that Hribal had written a document about the Norse legend Ragnar√∂k, as well as his dissatisfaction with society. The warrant also stated that two students had received threatening phone calls on the day before the stabbing, which were suspected to have been from Hribal. On September 26, 2014, psychologist Bruce Chambers testified that Hribal was inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, that he identified with the perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and that he had originally planned to carry out the stabbing on April 20, the fifteenth anniversary of Columbine, but changed the date to April 9, the birthday of Eric Harris, because April 20 fell on a Sunday that year. Prosecution, guilty plea, and sentencing Hribal was initially charged as an adult with four counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault, and one count of carrying a weapon on school property.Continuing Coverage of the Franklin Regional High School Stabbings, WTAE, April 9, 2014. On April 25, 2014, Hribal's charges were upgraded to 21 counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault, after investigators discovered a note written by him that declared his intention to take lives during the attack.New charges filed against Franklin Regional stabbing, Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, April 25, 2014.McClam, Erin. Alex Hribal Is Not 'a Loner or a Weirdo,' Lawyer Says, NBC News, April 11, 2014. In June 2014, Hribal pleaded not guilty to all charges. He waived a formal arraignment. The Westmoreland County Common Pleas Judge Richard E. McCormick, Jr. ordered a mental health assessment for Hribal. In September 2014, while leaving a mental health hearing, Hribal told a news reporter that he was sorry for committing the attack. He was expected to be transferred to Southwood Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after passing a medical examination and psychiatric evaluation, but the hospital refused to admit him, reportedly due to safety concerns. Three psychiatrists testified for the defense, saying that Hribal had major depressive disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. They all agreed that he was responding to treatment. A trial date was postponed several times. A hearing was held to determine whether the case would be transferred to juvenile court; victims of the rampage testified about their injuries and urged the judge to try Hribal as an adult. In September 2015, a judge ruled that Hribal must be transferred from a juvenile detention center to Westmoreland County Prison when he turns eighteen years old. In October 2015, this transfer was carried out, and the judge refused to set bail for Hribal, citing public safety concerns. In June and November 2015, testimony statements were given by victims and defense experts in regards to the decision whether Hribal's case should be moved to juvenile court. The prosecution argued that Hribal planned the attack in advance and traumatized his victims and the community, while Hribal's lawyer argued that no one was killed during the stabbings despite the serious injuries inflicted, and that the victims' testimonies indicated they appeared to have moved on. In May 2016, Judge Christopher Feliciani ruled that Hribal would be tried as an adult. On October 24, 2017, Hribal, then 20, pleaded guilty in the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas to 21 counts each of attempted homicide and aggravated assault. Defense attorney Thomassey said that the Hribal family wished to spare victims from having to testify and relive the attack at trial. The plea came after Judge Feliciani denied the defense's requests to allow Hribal to plead guilty but mentally ill. District Attorney John Peck stated that he planned to push for a prison sentence of 30 to 60 years, while Thomassey said he will argue for \\"as light a sentence as I can.\\" On January 22, 2018, Judge Christopher Feliciani sentenced Alex Hribal to serve 23 1‚ÅÑ2 to 60 years in prison. School security The school was not equipped with metal detectors. Since February 2013, the school district has had 130 video cameras from various schools live streamed to police, explained as a precaution against violent incidents. On May 5, 2014, the school distributed clear backpacks to all of its students, courtesy of Monroeville car dealership, #1 Cochran. School district spokeswoman Mary Catherine Reljac said in a statement that the measure was intended to \\"bring an added sense of safety and security during the school day as the school community continues to heal\\". Reaction Following the incident, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett visited Murrysville and held a press conference, giving a speech praising the heroes of the rampage, saying, \\"There are a number of heroes in this day. Many of them are students. Students who stayed with their friends and didn't leave their friends.\\" He also called April 9 another \\"sad day\\" in the country and asked if schools should have metal detectors. Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. released a statement on the incident, saying, \\"I am stunned by the senseless tragedy at Franklin Regional High School. Our schools should be places where children can learn and grow without fear of violence. I am inspired by the bravery of the school personnel and students, and I am grateful for the heroic work of the first responders, emergency and medical personnel who cared for those injured. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the entire Franklin Regional School District.\\" On April 10, U.S. President Barack Obama called Franklin Principal Ron Suvak to tell him that the FBI would continue to assist in the investigation of the attack.

A chromatography column contains the stationary phase, allowing the mobile phase to pass through it. Chromatography columns of different types are used in both gas and liquid chromatography. Materials * Liquid chromatography: Traditional chromatography columns were made of glass. Modern columns are mostly made of borosilicate glass, acrylic glass or stainless steel. To prevent the stationary phase from leaking out of the column interior a polymer, stainless steel or ceramic net is usually applied. Depending on the application material- and size-requirements may change. * Gas chromatography (GC): Older columns were made of glass or metal packed with particles of a solid stationary phase. More recently, narrower diameter (capillary) columns have been made using fused silica coated on the inside with a film of the stationary phase material. GC columns are typically very long to take advantage of their low resistance to the flow of carrier gas. The materials of the column and the stationary phase must be suitable for GC operating temperatures, which may range as high as 300¬∞C or more.Agilent Technologies. Capillary GC Columns Sizes While small-scale columns range from inner diameters of 0.5 cm and withstand pressures of up to 130 MPa,UHPLC in Life Sciences, Davy Guillarme, Jean-Luc Veuthey, Roger M. Smith, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012 industrial large scale columns reach diameters of up to 2 m and operate at considerable lower pressures (below 1 MPa). While it is favorable to view the packed bed of a column large scale columns are manufactured from steel due to its superior resilience. Chromatography columns can be used as stand-alone devices or in combination with manual or automated chromatography systems. Medium to large columns are almost exclusively operated together with automated systems to decrease the risk of process failure and loss of product. Different columns for different scales =Small scale= Transitions between scales are always fluent. There is no sharp cut that defines the end of small- and the beginning of medium/pilot scale. However, chromatography columns with an inner diameter (ID) of up to 5 cm are generally considered small scale or laboratory scale columns. Small scale chromatography columns are mostly intended for design of experiments (DoE); proof of concept; validation (drug manufacture) or research and development experiments. Columns of this scale category are distinguished by their small dimensions in comparison to chromatography columns intended for larger scales as well as relatively high pressure tolerance and selection of materials in contact with the liquid phase.

The mission of the office is to hold state and local governments accountable for the use of public funds.  History  = Territorial Auditors = In 1854, one year after Washington left the Oregon Territory and became a territory in its own right, the Washington Territorial Legislature established the position of Territorial Auditor. The territorial auditor was tasked with \\"maintaining records of all receipts and disbursements, a 'pre-audit' settlement of all claims and the issuance of warrants\\". In 1864, the Legislative Assembly tasked Territorial Auditor Urban E. Hicks with \\"...the duty...to report such plans as he may deem expedient for the support of the public credit; for lessening the public expenses; for using the public money to the best advantage and for promoting frugality and economy in regard to the fiscal affairs of the territory.\\" Hicks  Territorial Auditors and their years of service  Urban E.

He established many values that still form a core part of the Washington State Auditor's Office mission, such as placing the public welfare before personal interests and the welfare of the state before partisanship. He added several key tasks to the auditor's duties, including investigating discrepancies in the accounting and reporting of budgets. He was succeeded by Leban R. Grimes from 1893 to 1895, who continued Reed's agenda ensuring that the public good was placed before partisan interests. Grimes died suddenly in office, and Governon John H. McGraw appointed J.E. Frost to serve out Grimes' term from 1895 to 1897. Frost used many of the same financial models as his predecessor's and was optimistic about the overall solvency of the state despite the recession of the late 1890s. Neal Cheetham replaced Frost in 1897, serving as auditor until 1901. Cheetham belonged to the Populist Party and believed that \\"a man has no more right to use powers delegated to him by the people, while he holds an official position, for selfish or personal ends than he would have to use public funds committed to his trust for similar purpose.\\"Political and Legislative Manual = Auditors in the 20th Century = Support for the Populist Party waned and Cheetham lost the next election to John D. Atkinson who served from 1901 to 1905. During his term, Atkinson, a Republican, addressed a wide range of issues, from banking to liquor license taxes and employee reimbursements. Perhaps his greatest successes were in state fund management; his recommendations regarding military taxes and lending from school funds saved taxpayers‚Äîand the state‚Äîmoney. Republican Charles Clausen succeeded Atkison in 1905 and became Washington's first long-serving State Auditor. During his 28-year term, he greatly expanded the duties of the Office, adding \\"the Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices\\" to his responsibilities. This bureau's role was to \\"establish a system of uniform financial accounting and reporting by counties, cities, towns, townships and school districts\\". Following Clausen, the first Washington-born State Auditor Cliff Yelle served terms from 1933 to 1965. The Democrat was notable for refusing to pay 13 vouchers that lame-duck officials submitted for purported vacation pay. The officials protested Yelle's decision all the way to the state Supreme Court, but Yelle won the case and set the stage for cracking down on wasteful government spending. In 1941, the Legislature expanded the Office's authority to conduct annual audits of every state agency. Yelle also developed the investigative role of the Auditor's Office, probing the Highway Department's use of public funds to purchase luxury vehicles and accumulate other unnecessary costs. While government officials criticized Yelle for these investigations, the public retained him as auditor for 32 years, during which time the number local governments and state agencies audited by the Office more than doubled to 1,950. Robert V. Graham took office from Yelle in 1965 and served seven terms until his retirement in 1993. Graham, a Democrat, would describe the role of the State Auditor as a \\"window into state and local government for Washington citizens.\\"Graham To that end, Graham endeavored to bring audits of government performance into his Office's responsibilities, but legislative action in 1971 prevented him from doing so. Among his successes were the establishment of a fraud unit designed to detect and prevent fraud, the development of a uniform Budgeting Accounting and Reporting System (BARS) that applied to all local government, and the consolidation of the statewide, federal Single Audit Acts (also known as the SWSA). In 1982, the Legislature authorized the Whistleblower Program, allowing public employees to report waste of public resources to the Office. Graham died in April 2014. Brian Sonntag became Washington's ninth Auditor with his election as a Democrat in 1993. Sonntag prioritized raising the public profile of the Office, and championed government compliance with open meeting and public records laws. Under his tenure, the State Auditor's Office saw significant expansion of its powers to conduct performance audits. Initiative 900, approved by 57% of voters, authorized the state auditor to conduct independent performance audits of state and local governments. Sonntag did not seek re-election in 2012 and was succeeded by Troy Kelley.

Biography  = Early life = Lil Picard was born Lilli Elisabeth Benedick October 4, 1899 in Landau, Germany. She was the only child of Jakob, a wine producer and merchant, and Rosalie Benedick. She spent her childhood and adolescence in Strasbourg, Germany, which is now in France. Seeking solace from her parents, Lil found meaning in books. Westermann's Monashefte introduced her to art and inspired her to draw at an early age. = Marriages and Life in Berlin = Upon completing high school, Lil studied literature and art in Berlin. In 1918, at the age of 19, Lil met Fritz Picard, an antiquarian bookseller and intellectual with whom she lived in Berlin against her parent's wishes. Surrounded by dynamic artists, writers, composers, and filmmakers who moved to Berlin after World War I, the couple married in 1921. Lil Picard became a cabaret performer, acting in a small part in the film Vari√©t√©. Picard also became involved in the Berlin Dadaist movement, associating herself with Dadaists George Grosz, Hugo Ball, and Richard Huelsenbeck and artists Bertolt Brecht, Otto Dix, and Hans Hoffman. In 1926, she separated from Fritz Picard. Struggling with the skin condition shingles, her career in show business ended and Picard turned her attention to journalism. She wrote feuilleton for the Berliner B√∂rsenkurier and worked as a fashion designer and model. In 1933, the year of Hitler's accession to power, she became fashion editor of Zeitschrift f√ºr Deutsche Konfektion, and a cultural reporter for the fashion and women's supplements of the Berliner Tageblatt, among other publications. In 1935, Picard married banker Hans Felix J√ºdell. Due to the persecution of Jews and Hans' career pursuits, he changed his name to Henry Odell or O'Dell. = New York = In November 1936, Picard and her husband immigrated to New York City following the revocation of Picard's press credentials due to her Jewish heritage and growing anti-Semitic policies. In New York, Picard began to paint and exhibit works, and also worked as a journalist for over three decades, writing for Arts Magazine, East Village Other, and Interview. In the 1960s, Picard produced painting, collage and assemblages, and was known as a frequenter of Andy Warhol's Factory. Her 1967 performance, \\"Construction-Destruction-Construction,\\" at the Judson Church Gallery, was filmed by Andy Warhol.

Prevalence According to a report that recorded the types of child abuse reported in Australian states and territories in 2011‚Äì12, there were 48,420 substantiated cases of child endangerment, of which 5,828 were cases of sexual abuse. Recent relevant cases include Madden v Callanan [2016] FCCA 59;Madden v Callanan [2016 FCCA 59] Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330;Hughes v R [2015 NSWCCA 330] R v Maurice Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1. R v Maurice Van Ryn [2016 NSWCCA 1] Evidence from reports indicate that the majority of sexual assaults in Australia are undertaken by perpetrators known to the victims. According to a 2009 report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 42% of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement agencies in Australia that year took place against children under the age of 14; this statistic includes sexual assaults that adults said were committed against them when they were under the age of 14. The percentage of cases in which the child had a familial relationship with the perpetrator were: 26% of cases in southern Australia, over 20% of cases in the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, 39% of cases in New South Wales, and 30% of cases in Queensland. In March 2014, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that police had identified about 30 to 40 children under the care of the Department of Human Services of Victoria who have been abused by paedophile gangs. In March 2006, the ABC aired a show that contained allegations of large amount of child sexual abuse with Aboriginal communities. As a reaction, the government commissioned a report into child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory, which developed a report with recommendations. From this, there were a series of legislation passed that came to be known as \\"the intervention\\", as the government was intervening with these Northern Territory communities. However, this received widespread criticism and has been largely unsuccessful. Other studies Child sexual abuse has been connected to later emotional and behavioural problems in victims, and to an increased tendency toward alcoholism, depression, mental illness, and suicide. In 2007 the Queensland Children's Commission reported that \\"[s]ome 70% of psychiatric patients are known to have been sexually abused as children\\". A study carried out in 27 prisons in New South Wales found that 65% of male and female prisoners had been sexually and physically abused as children.\\"Child Sexual Assault: Facts and Statistics\\" (2012), p. 31.

The JACC is an agency within Australia's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, headed by Judith Zielke. It does not perform any search, recovery, or investigation activities, but coordinates the search effort and serves as a primary point of contact for information about the search for media and families of Flight 370 passengers. Background On 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China with 239 persons aboard; a search in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand was promptly initiated near the aircraft's last voice contact with air traffic control and final contact with secondary radar (the type of radar used by air traffic control). A week after the disappearance, Malaysia announced that military radar determined that the aircraft had traveled west across the Malay Peninsula after being lost by air traffic control. They also announced that communications with a satellite indicated that the aircraft continued to fly for several hours and was last located along one of two corridors‚Äîarcing northwest and southwest from Malaysia. The northern corridor was soon discounted and the focus of the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia and within Australia's concurrent aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) regions that extend to 75¬∞E longitude. On 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean; the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), Australia's search and rescue agency, initially coordinated the search within Australia's SAR region, correlating information with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and officials in Malaysia. History =Establishment= Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the creation of the JACC on 30 March 2014 to coordinate the search within Australian waters; the JACC became operational the following day, assuming from AMSA the coordination of the search effort and communications with the media, foreign governments, and between Australian government agencies. Initially based in Perth, Western Australia, the JACC offices were relocated in May 2014 to Canberra, although they can be quickly relocated to Perth if necessary. =Search= alt=A bathymetric map of the southeastern Indian Ocean and western Australia, with the locations of search zones, sonobouy drops, and calculated flight paths. An inset in the upper left shows the path of the ADV Ocean Shield which towed a Towed Pinger Locator and where it detected acoustic signals; the same inset also shows the seafloor sonar search performed in April‚ÄìMay 2014. After the establishment of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft. After the initial search efforts through May, active searching ceased as plans and preparations were made for a new phase, called the \\"underwater search,\\" which would be preceded by a bathymetric survey. Plans for the new phase were announced in late June and the underwater search commenced in October 2014. Organisation The JACC is a division of the Australian government's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. The Australian government has budgeted A$2 million over two years to the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development for costs related to the JACC. At the time of its establishment, retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston‚Äîformer head of Australia's military (2005‚Äì2011)‚Äîwas appointed to head the JACC by Prime Minister Abbott. After the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, in July 2014, Houston left the agency when he was appointed as Australia's special envoy in Ukraine to recover and repatriate bodies of Australian victims, assist relatives of Australian victims, and ensure that a proper investigation of the crash was initiated in accordance with international standards. In January 2015, Houston was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia for his military service and for his \\"continued commitment to serve the nation in leadership roles, particularly the national responses to the [Malaysia Airlines Flight 370] and [Malaysia Airlines Flight 17] disasters.\\" As of March 2015, Judith Zielke is the Chief Coordinator of the JACC. Zielke is also the Executive Director of the JACC's parent division, the Surface Transport Policy division, within the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Activities Angus Houston speaking at Joint Agency Coordination Centre press conference in Perth on 14 April 2014 The JACC does not perform any search, recovery, or investigation activities, but provides a single point of contact for affected parties, including relatives of the missing passengers and crew, and communication between agencies and organisations involved in the search. The JACC also provides information to the public about the latest developments in the search and recovery operation. =Search coordination= The JACC is responsible for coordinating the search efforts for Flight 370 within Australian waters. At the time of the agency's creation, the search effort involved China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States as well as several agencies of the Australian government: the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the Department of Defence, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The search activities also involved analysis of the flight's satellite communications by Inmarsat, the AAIB (UK), the NTSB (US), and other organisations. After the initial search efforts through May, the agency has worked primarily with Australian government agencies, Malaysia, and China to plan and carry out the bathymetric survey and underwater search. The JACC works closely with the ATSB, which is the agency responsible for defining the search area and carrying out the tenders for the underwater search and, if possible pieces of Flight 370 are located, the recovery effort. Geoscience Australia works closely with the ATSB to perform the bathymetric survey and underwater search. The JACC also works with Malaysia and China, which have both sent representatives to work at the JACC offices. =Media= The JACC is the primary source of information from Australian government concerning the search. Since September 2014, the JACC has issued weekly updates‚Äî\\"Operational Search Updates\\"‚Äîhighlighting the week's key developments, search progress, ship movements, and weather. The updates also mention and link to newly released images, interviews, videos, media statements, and reports concerning the search and released by agencies involved in search activities. The agency's website maintains press releases, transcripts of press conferences, communiqu√©s of the tripartite meetings (between Australia, China, and Malaysia), and photos, videos, maps, and reports published by several agencies that are related to the search. =Relatives of passengers= The JACC serves as a single point of contact for the relatives of Flight 370 passengers. The agency's weekly search updates are provided in both English and Mandarin Chinese (the majority of Flight 370's passengers were Chinese). In addition to search information, the JACC serves as a liaison with the passengers' families to provide visas, counselling, accommodation assistance, and interpretation services.

The focus of his work has been on achieving a molecular-level understanding of polymer structure and dynamics in multicomponent systems and mixtures, and to understand how these are affected by the thermodynamic interactions amongst the components. Polymer chain dynamics: Lodge's early work focused on the chain dynamics of polymers in solution and in miscible blends. In particular, Lodge and McLeish (2000) discussed the effect of local composition on the dynamics of polymers in a miscible blend. Their model was based on two simple assumptions. First, that dynamic heterogeneity occurs over a length scale on the order of a Kuhn length of the chain. Second, that each polymer in the blend experiences a ‚Äòself-concentration‚Äô that is higher than the bulk (average) composition, due to chain connectivity over this length scale. The impact is that the local dynamics of the two polymers in the blend may exhibit different dependencies on temperature and overall composition due to differences in local composition. This leads to a breakdown in time- temperature superposition, and the appearance of two distinct glass transition temperatures in the mixture. Block copolymer solutions: Lodge's research group has maintained long-standing interest in the self-assembly of block copolymers in solutions. Studying the phase behavior of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene in solvents of varying selectivity, the concept of phase trajectories was introduced to explain the phase sequences observed as a function of concentration in neutral and selective solvents connecting the solution behavior to that seen in block copolymer melts. From this foundation, the thermodynamics and kinetics of polymorphic order-order transitions were investigated. One paper of note demonstrated the thermoreversible, epitaxial face-centered cubic to body-centered cubic transition in highly ordered, micellar block copolymer solutions and its similarity to transitions observed in atomic systems (e.g. metals and alloys) supporting the general nature of the occurrence of this phase transition in materials. Miktoarm Star Polymers: In 2004, Lodge published the seminal paper on the self-assembly of miktoarm star terpolymers in solution; a paper that has been cited over 600 times. Using ABC miktoarm star polymers the first example of multicomponent block copolymer micelles was shown, driven by the mutual incompatibility of the hydrophilic A and hydrophobic B and C blocks. In a subsequent paper the simultaneous, segregated storage of two different chromophores in the different micelle domains was demonstrated, offering potential for use in chemical delivery in fields such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and foodstuffs. Polymers in Ionic Liquids: Lodge's recent work has focused on the self-assembly of block copolymers in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are considered by many to be ‚Äúgreen‚Äù solvents due to their vanishing vapor pressure, fire resistance, as well as their excellent chemical and thermal stability over wide temperature ranges. Besides elucidating the assembly properties of block copolymers in ionic liquids, Lodge has used these materials to produce molecular shuttles, gas separation membranes, and ion gel gate dielectrics for use in polymer thin film transistors. Education in Polymer Science: Lodge is a co-author of Polymer Chemistry, 2nd Edition, written with Paul Hiemenz (2007). In 2012 he was elected to the University of Minnesota Academy of Distinguished Teachers, and he received the Postbaccalaureate, Graduate, and Professional Education Award. Lodge is the co-holder of four patents.

He was a member of the Alpine Club and editor of the Alpine Journal. Much of his climbing and exploration was conducted with volcanologist Tempest Anderson and he published reports of his exploits and produced introductory books on Latin for scholars. Yeld received the Victoria Medal of Honour from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1925. Education and family life Yeld was born in 1845 and educated at Hereford Cathedral School. He continued his education at Brasenose College Oxford where he was awarded the Newdigate Prize for his poem \\"Virgil reading his √Üneid to Augustus and Octavia\\". In April 1877 he married Emily Elizabeth Adams (1852‚Äì1921) the niece of Professor John Couch Adams and sister of the Reverend Thomas Adams MA, mathematics master at St Peter's School in York, at which Yeld also taught. He had four sons who all attended St Peter's. In retirement, he appears to have lived in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Teaching career St Peter's School, York as it would have been during Yeld's career Yeld taught at St Peter's School from 1867 to 1919 (52 years). He appears to have been a popular teacher and involved in many aspects of the school. In particular, he organised well-regarded annual school plays. These appear to have always been Shakespeare and he began in 1879 due to the illness of another master with The Twelfth Night. Latterly, these gained higher profile and were sometimes attended by William Maclagan (Archbishop of York) and journalists from the Yorkshire Herald. Each year Yeld wrote an ‚Äì often lengthy ‚Äì epilogue or prologue to the plays summarising the achievements of its students or graduates ‚Äì known as Old Peterites. Yeld himself was a member of the Old Peterites despite not having been a student at the school: in 1911 he became a vice-president. In December 1917 Yeld was presented with a purse and given plaudits from colleagues and alumni in celebration of his 50th year at the school (see inset quote). It's not clear whether Yeld had a subject specialism or which of his interests beyond literature made it into his teaching. Alpine Journal Yeld served as Editor of the Alpine Journal for 30 years, initially virtually alone, later with John Percy Farrar. His solo editorship began in 1896 with Volume 18 and ended with Volume 24 in 1909. During this period climbing standards were improving and climbs in north and South America, the Himalaya and the Caucasus were being explored. Farrar became Assistant Editor in 1909. His vibrant and outgoing temperament proved a stimulus to the Journal; though Yeld was nominally Editor, Farrar seems to have done much of the work. The period covered by their joint editorship was a significant one for British climbers: Himalayan peaks were tackled, climbers became more competent using guides less, equipment and techniques improved. Their joint editorship ended in 1926 with Volume 38 with a message of farewell from both of them. Alpine excursions In August, during the school summer holidays, Yeld indulged his passion for climbing. His preference was for the eastern group of the Graian Alps as they did not attract the number of tourists that other alpine areas did. Scrambles in the Eastern Graians 1878 ‚Äì 1897, published in 1900, is his account of these visits, many of which had previously been included in the Alpine Journal. The book is dedicated to Dr. Tempest Anderson, York resident and photographer who accompanied him a number of times, and includes 12 of his photographs. Most of the routes Yeld climbed and described were new and he pioneered two new ascents: Aiguille de Tronchey and Pointe du Piolet. He considered local guides indispensable and he looked on them as friends and employed the same men year after year. The use of ropes and axes was routine, but he describes his amazement in 1895 when one of the guides made use of wedges to climb a difficult face before pulling up the others. Yeld frequently mentions the generosity of the local people in providing accommodation or food. On a climb of more than one day an overnight stay in a mountain refuge was not always possible. Local people then obliged but the shelter could be a shed shared with domestic livestock or a hayloft, or even a bed made with rhododendron branches. A number of times he dined on chamois or bouquetin (alpine ibex), which he preferred, given by local hunters. He regularly saw bouquetin and chamois on the slopes. Once he was delighted by the activities of a very close group of 40 chamois. As a keen gardener he regretted he could not visit the mountains in June to see the alpine flora at its best, but he still found time to botanise and make plant lists. There are numerous references in the accounts to the glory of alpine flowers. He seems to have been fond of Ranunculus glacialis (the glacier buttercup) from the number of times it is mentioned and his delight in finding it. Yeld comes across as extremely hardy, energetic and indefatigable. A lover of the mountain, its people, flora and tastiest fauna. Plant breeding and hybridising thumb Hemerocallis flava and Hemerocallis middendorfii the parent's for Yeld's first cultivar daylily: Apricot Yeld was an amateur breeder and hybridiser of the garden plants Hemerocallis (daylily) and Bearded Iris. He was one of the early pioneer breeders of Hemerocallis when there was very little material available. He was the first to introduce a hybrid, 'Apricot', which won the Royal Horticultural Society's Certificate of Merit in 1892 and is still available today. The 'Apricot' cultivar was bred from Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus L. (syn. flava) and H. middendorffii. Subsequently, he obtained further species including low-growing ones such as H. minor. The lemon yellow hybrid 'Francis' was created from one of these smaller species winning the RHS Award of Merit in 1895. During his lifetime he created and named over 30 hybrids including 'Gold Dust' which is still widely available. Yeld also produced some well-known irises. In 1923 he became the first President of the Iris Society, now the British Iris Society, founded in 1922. He was a friend of another iris breeder, Sir Michael Foster, naming one of his plants 'Sir Michael'. This iris, and another called 'Lord of June', were famous for some time.

He owns the only laser vision correction center in the US specializing in Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA, comprising LASEK and epiLASEK), which unlike LASIK is a newer, safer way to correct refractive errors that does not involve cutting a flap into the cornea. Dr. Chynn has been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, on CNN and Discovery Channel, in Time Magazine online, as well as on ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox News for LASEK as well as platinum \\"Eye Jewelry\\" and corneal tattoos. Dr. Chynn has also appeared on the Howard Stern Show as one of NYC's most eligible bachelors, as well on \\"Millionaire Matchmaker\\" with abrasive reality TV matchmaker Patti Stanger. Early life and education Emil Chynn was born in New York City to Kuo York (York) and Marie Noelle (Noelle) Chynn, a neuroradiologist and social worker, respectively, who had emigrated separately from Shanghai, China, and met in New York City. Chynn then grew up in Tenafly, New Jersey and graduated from Tenafly High School. In 1987 he received his B.A. degree in Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH and graduated cum laude. He received his MD with honors in numerous rotations, including General Surgery from Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons in 1992. He completed his transitional internship at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Greenwich Village, where he helped treat the victims of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. Chynn completed his residency in ophthalmology at Harvard University‚Äôs Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary in 1996, and his fellowship in Corneal Transplantation and Refractive Surgery at Emory University in 1997 under the surgeons George Waring III, MD, the \\"father of American refractive surgery\\" who headed the influential PERK study, the 1st FDA-sponsored study about laser vision correction, and Doyle Stulting, MD, PhD, a future President of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS). He received his MBA in management with a Certificate in Entrepreneurship from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2004. Career Chynn was Director of Refractive Surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and then Director of Refractive Surgery and an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at SUNY Brooklyn/Long Island College Hospital. In the late 1990s he worked as a LASIK surgeon for TLC Manhattan, part of the TLC Laser Eye Centers, which was then the largest laser chain in North America, and listed in NASDAQ. In 1999, he became the 1st LASIK surgeon in New York City to get LASIK himself. In 2000, he opened his own laser vision correction center, IWANT2020.com, Inc. He was a Resident Instructor and on the clinical faculty of Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital, and New York Eye & Ear Infirmary. He served as an expert in ophthalmology, cornea, and visual science for Coleman Research Group and Gerson Lehrman Group, which are \\"expert networks\\" and as an equities analyst for various Wall Street firms. He hosted his own cable TV show about refractive surgery on Manhattan Neighborhood Network, as well as a live call- in AM radio show on WEVD in New York City. In 2001, Chynn was the first physician to arrive at Ground Zero on 9/11, where he set up the first emergency room and triage center at a Burger King across the street from the former World Trade Center. In 2005, Chynn became the first laser vision correction surgeon in the New York Tri-State area to adopt exclusively Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA), which is an advancement on the older photorefractive keratectomy or PRK procedure, involving the non-cutting techniques LASEK and epi-LASEK, which have faster healing and recovery than PRK, but by avoiding cutting into the cornea, are safer than LASIK. In 2010, Dr. Chynn successfully performed the highest ASA procedure ever performed in the US, -22.00, on a patient from China. In April 2017 Dr. Chynn has given several lectures in Ukraine to ophthalmologists in order to share the experience and provide a scholarship. The scholarship has been provided by The Chynn Family Foundation. Dr. Chynn visited a few medical institutions and medical centers in the following cities of Ukraine: Lviv, Kiev, Kharkiv and Sumy. Lectures were given to ophthalmologists, MBA students, English school teachers and post graduates. The winner of the scholarship was able to join the Park Avenue Lasek Center of Dr. Chynn for 1‚Äì2 months. Media coverage Chynn was interviewed about consolidation in the laser vision correction industry and how that may impact future research by the combined companies by the Wall Street Journal, and about how today's physicians and surgeons are adopting social media and other alternative marketing techniques to communicate directly with the consumer by the New York Times. In 2013, Chynn was featured on CNN and the Howard Stern Show, where he discussed both laser vision correction and his single dating life, and offered his $100,000 Ferrari to any matchmaker, amateur or professional, who introduced him to a \\"nice girl if she became his wife\\". He was also featured as one of the single millionaires on Bravo TV‚Äôs Millionaire Matchmaker with Patti Stanger in March 2014. Chynn has been interviewed on CNN, ABC, and NBC, and was featured on CBS news as the only center they visited in New York City which did not use \\"tiered pricing\\" (which is also known as \\"bait-and-switch\\" pricing, where the center or doctor advertises \\"LASIK for $399/eye\\" when that price only holds true for people with prescriptions so low that they might not even wear glasses). In 2016, Chynn was featured on Discovery Channel and Fox News as the first eye surgeon in the Americas to insert a cosmetic platinum implant into the eye, known as \\"eye jewelry\\". Authorship and research Chynn is the co- author of over a dozen papers in peer reviewed journals about laser vision correction, including first-author articles in Ophthalmology, Archives of Ophthalmology, the American Journal of Ophthalmology, and the British Journal of Ophthalmology. He is also author of over 100 non-peer-reviewed articles about a wide variety of ophthalmology topics. He has authored book chapters and is a peer-reviewer for the journal Ophthalmology and American Journal of Ophthalmology. Chynn was Principal Investigator for the FDA trial for the 1st solid state excimer laser in the world, by the company Novatec. He has presented his research on LASIK, PRK, and the Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) techniques LASEK and epi-LASEK both in the US and internationally, including in China, Russia, Spain, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Mexico, and Egypt, and is a co-investigator at the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy in Ukraine. He is Medical Director for the only pure Refractive Fellowship program in the US that is affiliated with the San Francisco Match Program. =Peer-Reviewed Publications= Chynn EW.

The bill was introduced during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill The bill eliminates a variety of reports that federal agencies are required to prepare for Congress or the general public. An example of an eliminated report includes \\"annual summaries of airport financial reports.\\" Another example is a report \\"on the waiver of certain sanctions against North Korea.\\" Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on March 12, 2014, with a subsequent amendment in the nature of a substitute provided on April 21, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4194 eliminates requirements for 18 federal entities to prepare specific reports for the Congress. Based on information from the Office of Management and Budget and some affected agencies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would reduce costs that are subject to appropriation by about $1 million over the next five years. Enacting H.R. 4194 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4194 eliminates the requirement to prepare 85 reports that are produced by numerous federal agencies, including: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Executive Office of the President, the Government Accountability Office, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. By reducing the number of reports that must be prepared and printed, implementing H.R. 4194 would reduce the administrative costs of those agencies. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and imposes no costs on state, local or tribal governments. Procedural history The Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 11, 2014 by Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R, CA-49). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. On April 28, 2014, the bill was passed in the House in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Rep.

Between 2005 and 2010 he sailed double handed twice around the world in Berrimilla II, a Brolga-class 33 ft sailing boat. The first circumnavigation was around Cape Horn from Sydney to England and back around Africa, during which he communicated with Astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, the commander of Expedition 10 on the International Space Station. The second, via the North West Passage, evolved from Whitworth‚Äôs contact with the Space Station and a later meeting with Dr. Pascal Lee who runs NASA‚Äôs Haughton Mars Camp on Devon Island. Dr. Lee invited Whitworth to rendezvous at the Camp for the total solar eclipse of 1 August 2008. Berrimilla started and finished the first circumnavigation with a Sydney ‚Äì Hobart race and sailed double handed in the Fastnet Race on both. Whitworth posted daily logs on his website which were followed widely by people around the world and reposted or reported on other websites and in the press. Berrimilla's co-skipper for the first circumnavigation and the return half of the second was Peter Crozier. Corrie McQueen sailed the Pacific leg of the second and was joined by Kimbra Lindus from Dutch Harbour to Falmouth. As far as it is possible to ascertain, amongst other achievements Berrimilla II was the first vessel ever to sail from Australia to England via the North West Passage and the first to circumnavigate via the North West Passage under sail. Whitworth received several awards for these voyages, including, in 2009, the Ocean Cruising Club Barton Cup and, in 2010, the Cruising Club of America's Blue Water Medal for a circumnavigation of the world via the North West Passage West to East. When not at sea Whitworth teaches safety and sea survival to offshore sailors. During his professional career, he worked both in the Public Service and in private industry. He is a Fellow of the University of Wollongong. He has run about 30 marathons, including Stanley Marathon in the Falkland Islands during the first circumnavigation. His best time was 2hr 41min. in 1985.

The group is best known for featuring future King Crimson members Michael Giles and his brother Peter.  History  Trendsetters Limited was a beat group created in early 1964 by Bournemouth businessman, Roy Simon. Prior to engaging a local music agent to find suitable local musicians, Simon claimed to have carried out extensive market research to identify the key characteristics desired by young, mostly female, record-buyers.Bournemouth Times 24 February 1964\\"Humour first, music fifth, in Pop groups\\": Daily Telegraph 13 March 1964 Although musicianship had scored lower than a sense of humour, sex-appeal and personality, the members actually selected were all experienced musicians and included drummer Michael Giles and his brother, bassist Peter, later of Giles, Giles and Fripp and King Crimson, who had already recorded with Joe Meek. As a lover of big band music, Roy Simon had also decided to add trombone to the line-up to give the band a distinctive sound, and local jazz trombonist Mike Blakesley was recruited. The original line-up was completed by guitarist and songwriter Geoff Robinson and pianist Al Kirtley, formerly of Zoot Money's Big Roll Band, who had previously worked with the Giles brothers as lead guitarist in Dave Anthony and the Rebels. All members of the band were required to have at least some vocal ability. At an early stage Robinson decided not to pursue a full-time musical career (although some of his original songs were subsequently recorded by the band) and was replaced by Bruce Turner, a guitarist/vocalist from Andover. Trendsetters Limited released their first single, \\"In a Big Way\\", on 26 March 1964 on Parlophone Records, but despite widespread publicity, including an appearance alongside Henry Mancini on Southern Television's \\"Three-Go-Round\\", airplay on BBC Television's Juke Box Jury and subsequently four 15-minute shows on Radio Luxembourg, the record failed to enter the charts.Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles, 15th Edition Al Kirtley left the band shortly afterwards and was replaced on piano by a local club-owner, Allan Azern. The band's second single, \\"Hello Josephine\\" also failed to make the charts, as did a third single, \\"I'm coming Home\\", released in 1965. Trendsetters Limited continued to tour England and Germany but in 1966 Bruce Turner left. They continued for a short time as a four-piece under the name \\"The Trend\\" and later \\"The Brain\\" and recorded a number of tracks at Abbey Road, for some of which former band-member Al Kirtley was brought back on piano and piano-accordion.

Arden dedicates her efforts to ensure that older lesbians have access to community resources and that their unique life stories are recorded and celebrated. Eversmeyer realized and accepted her love for women while still a teenager. Because it was a time when women suspected of being lesbians were routinely expelled from college and fired from their jobs, she led a very closeted life. She met her first partner, Tommie, early in her career and they were together 33 years. Born to Herbert and Audrey Eversmeyer in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in 1931, Eversmeyer graduated from Texas State College for Women in 1951; she later completed graduate work at Sam Houston University. She worked in Texas public schools, primarily in Houston, as both an educator and counselor for over 30 years. After Tommie's death in 1985, Eversmeyer began to volunteer openly for lesbian rights. She started Lesbians Over Age Fifty (LOAF) in 1987 to encourage a safe environment, meeting places, and a social network for mid-life and older lesbians. She also served on the steering committee of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, a national network of women over 60 confronting ageism and improving the lives of lesbians everywhere. After being with her second partner, Charlotte, more than 25 years, the couple legally married in California. (Charlotte died on April 14, 2018). Today Eversmeyer is proud to live in a time when she can be her true self with acquaintances, friends, family, medical professionals, and everyone. In 1997 Eversmeyer, realizing that many of her friends were reaching the end of their lives, founded the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project \\"to collect and preserve our life stories (focusing on lesbians aged 70 and older), to honor the lives of old lesbians.\\" OLOHP offers outreach by sharing Herstories with isolated old lesbians and via education of senior care providers and the general public, to create environments that improve the lives of all old lesbians.. The project quickly grew by word of mouth and friends of friends to become more than a personal project. Eversmeyer began training others to extend the project's reach. Project volunteers have documented over 500 diverse life stories recording the sacrifices and obstacles faced by lesbians of that era. The collection is now archived, and continues to grow, as part of the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College (see WorldCat record). OLOHP has published two books of collected interviews: A Gift of Old Age (2009; Purchase from OLOHP or borrow from a library (see WorldCat holdings); and Without Apology (2012; Purchase from OLOHP or borrow from a library (see WorldCat holdings). In August 2011, a room in the Montrose Counseling Center was dedicated to Eversmeyer, ‚Äúwhose achievements are too numerous to list.‚Äù During National Women's History Month, March 2014, Eversmeyer was one of twelve honorees recognized for their contributions by the National Women's History Project.

Every one of these stories is important and interesting.‚Äù Mary Speegle, creator of The Lesbian Story Project, combines two interviews with Arden into a single 45-minute podcast published on 17 October 2016. In The Lesbian Story Project with Arden Eversmeyer, Arden talks about the motivation for, development of, and benefits from the Old Lesbian Herstory Project. In June 2017, Arden was selected to join Tony Carroll and Marion Coleman as Grand Marshals of the Houston Gay Pride Parade.

After graduating with an MFA from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1982, he was a fixture for over three decades in New York City's art scene. Since leaving New York for Travelers Rest, South Carolina in 2006 he has been featured in numerous magazines, newspapers and online articles some of which focus on his art and others on his home and studio. The Fire Inside, 1995 Biography Born in Columbus, Ohio, on February 5, 1955, Matt graduated from Upper Arlington High School in 1973. Some of Matt's fondest childhood memories were exploring nature while living in wooded Bernardsville, New Jersey. His love of nature and its four elements- fire, air, earth and water- permeated his life and art. Inspecting insects with his microscope, tending his grounds laden with flowers and edible plants, swimming in the Caribbean with his daughters or laps in the pool at his studio, lighting fireworks or a burn pile of pruned branches, and contemplating beautiful sunsets in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains were his simple joys that inspired his work. Deeply spiritual, Matt articulated, embraced and expressed through his art the transcendent issue \\"My work imparts a transformative experience that resonates with my longings to channel universal and spiritual planes; I want to transport the spirit, to remind us all that we are perfect beings passing through a transient world. My soul craves expression through poetic and timeless art that beckons the viewer to return time and again to find renewal and fresh experiences.\\" Matt earned his MFA from University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1982, under Peter Plagens. Previously, he studied under eminent South Carolina artists Carl Blair, Emery Bopp and Darell Koons at Bob Jones University, graduating in 197-, and then taught art to grade schoolers at Bob Jones Academy until 198-. During this time in the Carolinas, Matt received purchase awards from the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC (‚ÄúBiennial Exhibition of Piedmont Painting and Sculpture‚Äù), and the Spartanburg Art Museum, and had a painting chosen by renowned New York Times art critic, Roberta Smith, for the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston for its ‚Äú30th Annual GSCA Exhibition‚Äù. His work was exhibited in curated shows, including at the Reston Fine Arts Center in Virginia; Auckland Art Museum in North Carolina; Huntington Museum of Art in West Virginia; Greater Birmingham Fine Arts Exhibition in Alabama; Greenville County Museum of Art (‚ÄúFifth Annual Curator‚Äôs Choice Exhibition‚Äù) and Clemson University Lee Hall Gallery in South Carolina (‚ÄúFive South Carolina Artists‚Äù) and (‚ÄúSC Arts Commission Annual Exhibition‚Äù). Matt lived in New York City from 1982 through 2004, where the majority of his body of artwork was created, at studios in Red Hook, on Columbia Street and East Second Street, as well as in Trenton, NJ. His archives from this period include paintings and works on paper in all scales from the abstract expressionist pieces bursting with the electric energy of the 1980s NYC art scene, to his reductive work reflecting appreciation of the grid beginning in the late 1990s. During this phase of his career, his work was exhibited in 15 solo and over 30 group shows, including galleries in NYC, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Scottsdale, Omaha, and Zurich, Switzerland. In 1993, Matt was awarded the highest honor for an individual artist bestowed by the National Endowment for the Arts, a Visual Arts Fellowship in Painting, for his birch plywood series, representing the beginning of his signature technique of embedded glyphs in multiple layers of pigmented gypsum. This series also earned him a solo show in 1993 at the prestigious Charles Cowles Gallery in NYC, concurrent with a solo show for Dale Chihuly. Matt raised his four daughters in Manhattan with his former wife Heather Evans, sharing his studio with his daughters creating artwork to their favorite music as he painted were his most treasured memories. In 2006, Matt relocated to a rural setting between Greenville, SC and Asheville, NC. In 2009, he designed and contracted to build a live/work studio on an acre of land, and began to paint again in December after a 5-year hiatus. He was honored that the Greenville County Museum of Art offered him a major exhibition from November 2011 to January 2012. The Museum showcased 63 of Matt's artworks spanning 27 years, published a color plate catalogue and acquired a painting for its permanent collection. Since his move to South Carolina, Matt met many devoted collectors whom he considered friends, and collaborated with Eric Brown Design for placement of his work. In late 2015, Matt exhibited at Art San Diego, winning the Director's Choice Award for a 72 x 72 inch triptych, and at Spectrum Miami. He has been represented by Forre & Co. Fine Art in Aspen, Colorado since 2016. Matt's studio continues as a venue for showing his work to collectors, gallerists, designers and museum staff. His work may also be experienced at nearby Hotel Domestique, with which he has collaborated since 2014, and at Forre & Co.

Tropical Languor #3, 2004 Artist Statement My work imparts a transformative experience that resonates with my longings to channel universal and spiritual planes; I want to transport the spirit, to remind us all that we are perfect beings passing through a transient world. My soul craves expression through poetic and timeless art that beckons the viewer to return time and again to find renewal and fresh experiences. What distinguishes my work is the synthesis of two disparate approaches - free-form mark-making and a formalized grid based on spatial frequency. Developed and refined over 26 years, my unique fusion of process and materials plays a vital role in delivering this vision. My inspiration has evolved from a wellspring of sources, from petroglyphs to the concept of cubism. Since the late 70's I have devoured the brilliant and awe- inspiring masterpieces of Mondrian. I resonate with Paul Klee's belief that many other realities are open and that his work was a way to access those realms. I am also moved by Klee's respect for nature and childlike spirit, expressed through colorful pictoral symbols and experimentation with materials. I am transported by Miro's constellation pieces with their dance of amazing color and perfectly located glyphs celebrating humanity and the heavens. An integral element in my work is free-form drawing. The freedom in my drawing relates to Pollock's drip paintings and Marden's paper pieces‚Äîboth used sticks to disconnect from the surface, allowing for serendipity. My drawing also evokes the esoteric asemic scribbles of Cy Twombly and his gifted palette. The other primary thrust of my work, the innate use of geometry with a reductive aspect, was influenced by studying several artists, including Mondrian. I have enjoyed and gleaned from the solid Matt Baumgardner colored architecture of Marden's panel paintings. I have the utmost respect for Robert Ryman's entire body of work. Alfred Jensen had a significant impact on my gravitation towards the formal grid. Carl Andre's purity of simplicity and materials appeal to my sensibilities. I am impressed by Donald Judd's architectural basis built on intuitive mathematics, the perfection of his spatial frequency and the bravery of his reduction. The zen-like peace and ethereal subtlety of Agnes Martin's work inspires me. Like James Turrell and Robert Irwin, I am fascinated by the interplay of space with light. My paintings are created from multiple layers of ‚ÄúMud‚Äù‚Äî gypsum pigmented with Golden Acrylics or powder pigments. Into each thick wet layer I draw with graphite pencils on the canvas horizontally propped on paint cans on the floor. The physicality of the mud interrupts my drawing, akin to the ancients cutting into earth or stone to make their marks with sticks and other tools. Prior to drawing, I allow my mind to let go and be transported to a meditative state, flooded with simultaneous thoughts ranging from the sacred to the profane. The primitive simplicity and childlike freedom of the resulting glyphs yield pure, honest, unadulterated discovery and expression. Raw and visceral, the marks convey mysterious asemic meanings unique to each observer. Many of these etched strata are then heated to create cracks alluding to natural decay, or sanded to excavate hidden and unexpected treasures of glyphs buried in the alchemy of the pigmented Mud. These multiple layers of drawings, whether ultimately visible forms or invisible buried ghost marks, affect the resolved piece and represent the teeming stream of fractal human thoughts unfolding each nanosecond. In contrast to this subconscious free-form drawing is the formalized spatial frequency of the grid, i.e. the intuitive use of geometrical forms. Since the late 70's, I have often structured works with an underlying architectural armature to anchor the infinitely available directions that then unfold as I approach each painting. Then in 1999, after studying this aspect of Piet Mondrian and Alfred Jensen and meeting Donald Judd, I appreciated the virtues of the formal grid and enjoyed the challenge of using it. I later realized that there were other influences contributing to this refinement of my vision, such as the need to release the overwhelming power within the grids of streets and skyscrapers that surrounded me for 22 years in NYC. The grid is based on intuitive mathematics; it is dictated in each piece by finding the perfect relationship among the scale and number of elements to the field and to each other. The grid tends to be either superimposed on the surface of the painting or inlaid, a pattern of squares, lines or triangles. Once the grid is intuited, its execution requires a workmanlike process with excruciating attention to the detailed geometry. The pattern is first mapped out, followed by the meticulous application of multiple layers of paint and finished with pearl iridescence. I really don't fully see what has been created until the piece is saturated with Lascaux matte varnish, which intensifies and further activates the excavated colors from the various strata. Light is absorbed through the rugged and uneven layers of Mud, like a bas relief, casting shadows and highlights. Contrasted with this earthiness is the pearlescent grid, shimmering with kinetic energy. Reflective pearlescent elements become figures or windows or portholes ushering the observer into the depths of the painting's mystical asemic messages imbedded in the Mud. The experience is both an intimate, internalized view of the cosmos while at the same time an expansive one.

ISAs have gained prominence as an alternative to the traditional student loan system in American higher education, and a number of private companies now offer ISAs for a variety of purposes, including as a funding source for college tuition. ISAs are often considered to be less financially risky to a borrower than a traditional private student loan. In the UK this type of agreement received final FCA (UK financial regulator) approval, under a unique regulatory framework. So far StepEx is the only firm to operate as a regulated ISA provider, underwriting the credit with funds from large UK financial institutions. ISAs are only currently available in the UK for post-graduate degrees in professional fields from top universities. This presents a more widely available and affordable alternative to debt for post-graduation student funding. Characteristics Income share agreements are characterized by a percentage share of future income for some specified period of time. They can function like non-voting shares in a company where the individual student is treated like a company. In the American system, this usually involves the investor transferring funds to an individual in exchange for a fixed percentage of their future income. Other features of income share agreements may include a) a fixed duration of time for the income sharing b) an income exemption where the borrower does not owe anything below a certain income, and/or c) a buyout option, where the borrower may pay some specified fee to exit the contract prior to the full duration of the term. Some ISA investors offer different terms to different students based on their predicted likelihood of success, while others offer the same terms to all students. Potential groups of investors could include for-profit companies, altruistic non-profits, alumni groups, educational institutions, and local, state, or federal governments. History Milton Friedman originally proposed the concept in 1955, in his essay \\"The Role of Government in Education\\", in which he argued that students might beneficially be funded through an \\"equity investment\\" such that:The Role of Government in Education, 1955, Milton Friedman, Economics and the Public Interest, ed. Robert A. Solo, Rutgers College Press, New Jersey, accessed 30 January 2019. In the 1970s Yale University attempted a modified form of Friedman‚Äôs proposal with several cohorts of undergraduate students. At Yale, instead of making individual contracts for a fixed number of years, all members of the cohort agreed to pay back a percentage of earnings until the entire cohort‚Äôs balance had been paid off. However, the system left students frustrated that they were paying more than their fair share, by being forced to make payments on behalf of peers unwilling or unable to pay back their loans. In 2013, Oregon legislators passed a bill that would investigate Pay It Forward as a college financing scheme. The model would allow students to attend college tuition-free, and then pay a proportion of their incomes post-graduation to finance the cost of their studies. However, unlike the income share agreement model, Pay It Forward would be publicly funded, and it would offer fixed percentage repayments across all institutions. Public debate over the Oregon plan led to renewed interest in equity-based funding models, including a prominent summit on income share agreements at the New America Foundation and a policy paper from the American Enterprise Institute. On April 9, 2014, Senator Marco Rubio announced the introduction of legislation in the US Congress that would 'broaden the use' of income share agreements. Advantages Proponents of ISAs argue that they provide significant benefits over existing models of college financing: Efficient allocation of resources Since investors have an incentive to allow students to pay lower shares of their income when they enroll in high quality, low-cost educational programs, ISAs lead to a more efficient allocation of financial resources between colleges. This allows students to go to universities and educational institutions with higher placement and completion rates. A significant problem right now is that students frequently \\"underplace\\", i.e. prefer to go to a less expensive school, even if career outcomes from such schools are worse. ISAs allow a way to reward going to schools that provide more value and better career outcomes. Insurance and downside protection ISAs reduce risk for students, and therefore act as an insurance policy for graduates with low earnings: This is a non- trivial benefit, since we know, based on current studies that student loans can impact both short term career outcomes and long term wealth. For instance, recent articles indicate that student loans make it difficult for individuals to participate in the stock market to build long term wealth: > \\"My money is spent servicing student loans,\\" said Marcus Wallace, a 25-year- > old waiter in Washington, D.C. Until that debt is reduced, he explained, the > great stock market bull run will have to go on without him. Lower job search costs Research indicates that income based repayments make students' career outcomes more efficient by making the job search process less costly. If you are not worried about how to make your next repayment immediately, you are free to search for a job that is a better fit for your skills and can help you grow your career. Career development augmentation Income share agreements align the incentives of investors to that of the student‚Äîi.e., both would like the student to do well in the job market. This creates an opening to combine ISA financing with career enhancement tools like career mentoring and networking support. Students that need education finance the most (including low income, minority, and first generation students) also typically have limited social capital like family-based networks and career mentors that are frequently critical to success in the job market. ISAs augmented with career development provide a nice way to overcome such limitations. Relevant laws by country =US= The US allows its citizens to have income sharing agreements. Common concerns =Indentured servitude= One of the most frequently cited concerns with Income Share Agreements is that they are a form of indentured servitude. Critics argue that because students owe a percentage of their income, the investor therefore own a piece of the student. For instance, Kevin Roose wrote in New York magazine that ISA companies give \\"young people in the post-crash economy the chance to indenture themselves to patrons in the investor class.\\" However, advocates of ISAs contend that since students have no legal obligation to work in a particular industry, and since it is illegal for investors to pressure them into a certain career, students are no more ‚Äúindentured‚Äù than those with a student loan. In fact, someone with a traditional student loan has less choice than someone with an ISA, because the student with a loan needs to be in a career where they make at least enough income to cover their monthly payment, whereas someone with an ISA can choose to never make any money, and would never owe the investor a dime. =Uncaptured positive externalities= Since Income Share Agreements are priced based on likely economic success, critics argue that programs that are not economically viable but still valuable to society may not receive ISAs. For instance, a Masters of Social Work is an expensive degree, but social workers often are not paid very much. Therefore, investors may not offer Income Share Agreements for social workers given current tuition rates. However, the same argument could be made for those with certain majors in the liberal arts. This risk is mitigated so long as other financing options are available, such as subsidized loans and grants from the federal government. =Discrimination= As of now, there are no documented cases of discrimination based on race or gender with ISA agreements, but some worry that should ISAs become a more popular model, the potential for discrimination could increase. While there are already anti-discrimination laws in most financial markets that would likely apply to ISA investors, the question, as of now, has not been completely resolved. Some advocates argue that ISAs are less discriminatory as compared to loans: =Creaming= Some worry that ISAs would have the effect of \\"creaming\\" the best students and only fund elite institutions. However, ISAs should theoretically fund all economically viable programs (that is the future income of their graduates proportionately aligns with the cost of the degree), so the only way that could be true is if the vast majority of institutions are not economically viable. = Institutions That Offer Income Share Agreements = Income Share Agreements are steadily gaining traction among professional investors, skills training programs, accredited colleges and universities, with many prominent programs offering Income Share Agreements as a part of their tuition options. Institutions offering ISAs include:  Edly  Edly is an ISA marketplace that funds both private Income Share Agreements directly to students as well as partners with schools to help them fund their ISA program.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a one step nucleic acid amplification method to multiply specific sequences of RNA. It is used to diagnose infectious disease caused by RNA viruses. It combines of the LAMP DNA-detection with reverse transcription, making cDNA from RNA before running the reaction. RT-LAMP does not require thermal cycles (unlike PCR) and is performed at a constant temperature between 60 and 65 ¬∞C. RT-LAMP is used in the detection of RNA viruses (GroupS II, IV, and V on the Baltimore Virus Classification system), such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Ebola virus Applications RT-LAMP is used to test for the presence of specific RNA-samples of viruses for the specific sequence of the virus, made possible by comparing the sequences against a large external database of references. = Detection of the COVID-19 virus = The RT-LAMP technique is being supported as a cheaper and easier alternative to RT-PCR for the early diagnostics of people that are infectious for COVID-19. There are open access test designs (including the recombinant proteins) which makes it legally possible for anyone to produce a test. In contrast to classic rapid tests by lateral flow, RT-LAMP allows the early diagnosis of the disease by testing the viral RNA. The tests can be done without previous RNA-isolation, detecting the viruses directly from swabs or from saliva. = Detection of non-human viruses = One example of use case of RT-LAMP was as an experiment to detect a new duck Tembusu-like, BYD virus, named after the region, Baiyangdian, where it was first isolatedAnother recent application of this method, was in a 2013 experiment to detect an Akabane virus using RT-LAMP. The experiment, done in China, isolated the virus from aborted calf fetuses. Methodology = Reverse transcription = A specific sequence of the cDNA is detected by 4 LAMP primers. Two of them are inner primers (FIP and BIP), which serve as base for the Bst enzyme copy the template into a new DNA. The outer primers(F3 and B3) anneal to the template strand and help the reaction to proceed. As in the case of RT-PCR, the RT-LAMP procedure starts by making DNA from the sample RNA. This conversion is made by a reverse transcriptase, an enzyme derived from retroviruses capable of making such a conversion. This DNA derived from RNA is called cDNA, or complementary DNA. The FIP primer is used by the reverse transcriptase to build a single- strand of copy DNA. The F3 primer binds to this side of the template strand as well, and displaces the previously made copy. = Amplification = This displaced, single-stranded stranded copy is a mixture of target RNA and primers. The primers are designed to have a sequence that binds to the sequence itself, forming a loop. The BIP primer binds to the other end of this single strand and is used by the Bst DNA polymerase to build a complementary strand, making double-strand DNA. The F3 primer binds to this end and displaces, once again, this newly generated single-stranded DNA molecule. This new single strand that has been released will act as the starting point for the LAMP cycling amplification. This single-stranded DNA has a dumbbell-like structure as the ends fold and self-bind, forming two loops. The DNA polymerase and the FIP or BIP primers keep amplifying this strand and the LAMP-reaction product is extended. This cycle can be started from either the forward or backward side of the strand using the appropriate primer. Once this cycle has begun, the strand undergoes self-primed DNA synthesis during the elongation stage of the amplification process. This amplification takes place in less an hour, under isothermal conditions between 60-65 ¬∞C. = Read out = The read out of RT-LAMP tests is frequently colorimetric. Two of the common ways are based on measuring either pH or magnesium ions. The amplification reaction causes pH to lower and Mg2+ levels to drop. This can be perceived by indicators, such as Phenol red, for pH, and hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), for magnesium. Another option is to use SYBR Green I, a DNA intercalating coloring agent. Eppendorf tubes. Advantages and disadvantages Vienna BioCenter. This method is specifically advantageous because it can all be done quickly in one step. The sample is mixed with the primers, reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase and the reaction takes place under a constant temperature. The required temperature can be achieved using a simple hot water bath. PCR requires thermocycling; RT-LAMP does not, making it more time efficient and very cost effective. This inexpensive and streamlined method can be more readily used in developing countries that do not have access to high tech laboratories. A disadvantage of this method is generating the sequence specific primers. For each LAMP assay, primers must be specifically designed to be compatible with the target DNA.

A member of the Association of Research Libraries, the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library is ranked among the top 120 research libraries in North America and is a significant educational and cultural resource in the community. Howard Tilton Library NOLA History The Howard-Tilton Memorial Library was founded in 1938, when the collections of three pre-existing, smaller libraries were merged. The most significant of these early library collections was that of the F.W. Tilton Memorial Library, dedicated in 1902 in honor of New Orleans businessman and philanthropist Frederick William Tilton. The Howard Memorial Library dated to the 19th century, and was a private collection of manuscripts accessible to the public at a location in downtown New Orleans. Once merged, the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library was first located in Jones Hall before moving to its current, five- story building in 1968. Collections In addition to its general collections, which provide millions of print resources in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural and applied sciences, the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library also is home to many special collections. The library houses the Louisiana Research Collections, the William Ransom Hogan Jazz Archive, the Southeastern Architectural Archive, and University Archives. In addition, the Latin American Library at the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library is among the world's foremost library collections for Latin American Studies, containing rare books, manuscripts, maps, images, and rubbings of Mayan stelae, as well as a large circulating collection. Hurricane Katrina When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans on August 29, 2005, the 40,000 square foot basement of the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library was flooded with more than eight feet of water. Four feet of water filled the basement of the library annex in Jones Hall. These areas housed the library's special collections, the Maxwell Music Library, and a very large collection of government documents. More than 700,000 print volumes and recordings, 700,000 manuscript folders and archival items, and 1.5 million individual pieces of microform were submerged. Due to serious flooding and damage to nearby neighborhoods, the library was inaccessible to reconnaissance teams for several days. In that time, the standing water in the basement, combined with the lack of electricity (and, thus, lack of temperature control and air circulation), led to high humidity and temperature and thus the development of mold in the library at large. The disaster management company BELFOR was called to the scene as quickly as possible to begin recovery work. A temporary air circulation system run by generators was installed just 10 days after the storm and within a month, all of the water had been pumped out of the basement. The damage from the flooding was significant. Basement walls were coated in slime and muck. Furniture and shelving had floated to the corners of the space, dislodging the materials that they once had housed, and subjecting them to submersion. The Maxwell Music Library had held more than 43,000 titles including books, scores, journals, and many rare and historic sound recordings on CD and LP. More than 70 percent of the printed books and scores were salvaged for restoration, but no recordings could be saved. The Government Documents Archive, which had held over 500,000 volumes, lost 90% of its collection. Nearly all of the salvaged government documents were trapped in storage-unit containers that had to be ripped apart to access the saturated material inside. A very large Microforms area on the north side of the basement had held more than 30,000 titles of facsimile collections of rare or scholarly material and newspaper archives. Less than five percent of these materials could be salvaged because of the damage that lengthy immersion in dirty water can do to microforms, especially in formats such as fiche or microcard. None of the materials from the original 19th-century Howard Collection could be salvaged, due to structural wreckage and especially dangerous conditions in that area of the library. Recovery Despite the significant obstacles to success, more than 300,000 important print volumes, 18,000 reels of microfilm, and 629,711 archival items affected by the storm were salvaged and restored through a highly technical and elaborate process. Tulane University established the Libraries Recovery Center in 2008 to sort the restored items, check them against the library's historic catalogue, create an inventory of materials unaccounted for, and return the materials to the library's collections. In 2013, this task was still ongoing. The Howard-Tilton Memorial Library reopened in spring 2006 for the start of the first post-Katrina semester. At that point, a battery of temporary HVAC units were being used to combat mold and humidity by distributing air throughout each floor by long semi-inflated tubes hung from the ceilings and attached through the windows along the back of the building to eight galvanized metal towers. In August 2013, plans were announced to replace these climate control systems with a more permanent solution, as well as to add a 5th and 6th floor to the library. The completion date is scheduled for Fall 2015. The basement of the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library remains gutted and empty, as does the basement level in Jones Hall.

Life Son of William Smith, who married in 1657 Elizabeth, daughter of Giles Wetherall of Stockton, he was born at Lowther, Westmorland on 10 November 1659, one of 11 brothers, who included Joseph Smith and others well known in their time. He was educated by his father at Bradford, Yorkshire, under Christopher Ness, and then at Appleby grammar school. Smith was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge on 12 June 1674 as a sizar, graduating B.A. 1677, and M.A. 1681. On leaving he was ordained deacon and priest of the Church of England by Archbishop Richard Sterne; in July 1682 he was admitted a minor canon of Durham Cathedral, was shortly afterwards collated to the curacy of Croxdale, and on 1 July 1684 to that of Witton Gilbert. From 1686 to 1689 he acted as chaplain to Lord Lansdown, the English ambassador at Madrid. In 1694 he was appointed domestic chaplain to Nathaniel Crew, who in the following year collated him to the rectory and hospital of Gateshead, and on 25 September 1695 to the seventh prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral. In 1696 Smith was created D.D. at Cambridge, and three years later was made treasurer of Durham, to which the bishop added in July 1704 the rectory of Bishop-Wearmouth. Here he rebuilt the rectory and restored the chancel of the church, but In 1713 his health began to fail, and he died at Cambridge on 30 July 1715. He was buried in the chapel of St John's College, where a monument was erected, with an inscription by his friend Thomas Baker. Works Smith undertook his major work, an edition of Bede's Historia, under the influence of Thomas Gale, encouraged by Ralph Thoresby, and with assistance of Humfrey Wanley on Old English. He spent the majority of his time residing in Cambridge, and working on it, but did not live to complete the preparation. His son George brought out in 1722 the Histori√¶ Ecclesiastic√¶ Gentis Anglorum Libri Quinque, auctore Venerabili B√¶da ‚Ä¶ cura et studio Johannis Smith, S. T. P., Cambridge University Press. This edition is described by David C. Douglas as \\"an enormous advance\\" on previous ones, adding that textual criticism of Bede hardly then changed until 1896, when the Christopher Plummer edition appeared. He also calls Smith one of \\"the founders of English medieval scholarship\\". It contains also the preface to The Reckoning of Time, and a world-chronicle. It also had the Old English version of the Historia ecclesiastica. Smith also furnished materials for Edmund Gibson's edition of William Camden, and to James Anderson for his Historical Essay in 1705. Family Smith married in 1692 Mary, eldest daughter of William Cooper of Scarborough, who gave his daughter a portion of ¬£4,500; they had, with four other sons, George Smith the nonjuror.

In the centre are Tintin and Snowy (From The Castafiore Emerald) This is the list of fictional characters in The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©. The characters are listed alphabetically, grouped by the Main characters, the Antagonists, and the Supporting characters. Before the list, there is an Index of characters for each of the 24 albums. The supporting characters Herg√© created for his series have been described as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with a strength of character and depth of personality that has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens. Herg√© used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters recur throughout the series. During the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, and the subsequent restrictions this imposed, Herg√© was forced to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. The public responded positively. Colourful main characters, villainous antagonists, and heroic supporting cast were all introduced during this period.

From left to right: Hans Boehm and Spalding are against Captain Haddock and Tintin =Al Capone= Al Capone is a Chicago crime boss and the main villain in Tintin in the Congo and Tintin in America. In Tintin in the Congo, he runs a criminal diamond smuggling operation, trying to gain control of African diamond production. He orders thugs to face Tintin in Tintin in America. Capone's main rival in Chicago is Bobby Smiles. Tintin arrests 355 members of Capone's Central Syndicate of Chicago Gangsters. Capone himself is tied up by Tintin and arrested, but he escapes. The character Al Capone is based on the real-life Al Capone of Chicago. Al Capone was alive in 1931 when Herg√© depicted him in his comics. It would be the last real-life individual to appear as a character in the Adventures under their real name. =Allan Thompson= Allan Thompson, commonly Allan, is a British-American criminal henchman and merchant seaman, often involved in smuggling and other criminal activities. His complete name is Allan Thompson in the original French, but English translations leave out his surname to avoid confusion with Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson. Originally, Allan was the treacherous first mate of Captain Haddock in The Crab with the Golden Claws, keeping him drunk and running the ship to smuggle opium, Allan takes orders from Omar Ben Salaad. He appears retroactively when Herg√© redrew the earlier adventure Cigars of the Pharaoh, as he was not in the original. The following year, Herg√© featured him in The Red Sea Sharks in league with Rastapopoulos, where his ship is used in slave trading. In Flight 714 to Sydney, he is Rastapopoulos' main accomplice. He is shown savagely beaten after escaping the Sondonesians, causing him to suffer a loss of all his teeth. He escapes a volcanic eruption and flees in a rubber raft with the other criminals, but he and his accomplices are hypnotised and compelled to board a spaceship, whisking them away to an unknown fate. Allan is portrayed by Daniel Mays in the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. =Alonso P√©rez and Ram√≥n Bada= Alonso P√©rez and Ram√≥n Bada are the chief antagonists in The Broken Ear. They discover that a diamond is being concealed in a fetish and do anything to possess it. P√©rez, an engineer, is the leader of the two. Bada, the follower, is a knife thrower, and uses more Spanish in his speech than P√©rez. While fighting with Tintin in hand-to-hand combat for the diamond, Ram√≥n and Alonso fall into the sea, each clutching whom they believe is Tintin, and drown. We see them taken to Hell by smiling winged demons. =Colonel Alvarez= Colonel Alvarez is the polite aide-de-camp to General Tapioca who appears in Tintin and the Picaros. He is the one who receives Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus when they arrive in San Theodoros and takes them to their apartment. When he is first introduced in the adventure, he seems to be friendly and good-natured, which impresses the Captain. However, it is then revealed that Alvarez is a part of the plot orchestrated by Colonel Sponsz to eliminate Tintin, the Captain, and the Professor, and Alvarez is enraged when his men fail. When General Tapioca is overthrown, Alvarez shifts over to Alcazar's side, even expressing disappointment that Tapioca will not be executed. He then assists Tintin and the Captain in rescuing Thomson and Thompson and also freeing Bianca Castafiore and her entourage. =Bab El Ehr= Sheikh Bab El Ehr is an Arab insurgent who fights Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, ruler of the fictional Arabian state of Khemed; though overall he comes across as a villain rather than a noble fighter. In Land of Black Gold, he is shown allied with Dr. M√ºller and his Skoil Petroleum Company and fighting a guerrilla war against Ben Kalish Ezab, the Emir. Bab El Ehr's men mistake Tintin for a weapons smuggler working for the sheikh, and rescue him from Ben Kalish Ezab's soldiers. After discovering the mistake, Bab El Ehr accuses Tintin of being a spy for the Emir and makes him a prisoner. Tintin collapses from thirst after a long march on foot through the desert, and is left behind by Bab El Ehr. Bab El Ehr plays a major behind-the-scenes role in The Red Sea Sharks, having used Mosquito fighter planes provided by Mr. Dawson to carry out a successful coup d'√©tat and overthrow the Emir. After Dawson discovers Tintin spying on his arms dealership, he warns Bab El Ehr, who puts out a reward for the capture of Tintin and Haddock. At the close of The Red Sea Sharks, Bab El Ehr's regime is overthrown. His name is derived from the Brussels dialect word babbelaar or \\"tattler\\". =Barnaby= Barnaby is the man hired by the antique dealers, the Bird brothers, to acquire the three parchments from the three model ships of the Unicorn‚Äîthe first of which he finds in the Brussels Place du Jeu de Balle old market in The Secret of the Unicorn. When he failed his employers and Tintin purchased the ship instead, first he stole Tintin's Unicorn, then ransacked Tintin's flat after he broke the mast and did not find the parchment. Later, he chloroforms Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine and breaks the mast of his ship, acquiring a parchment. When he brings it to the Bird brothers and then asks them for more money to get the other two, then threatens to expose them when they refuse, he is shot and wounded outside Tintin's flat. He turns from his employers and tries to warn Tintin of them but could only point to feeding birds. =Basil Bazarov= () Basil Bazarov (formerly Mazarov in an early edition) of the Korrupt Arms Company (Vicking Arms Company in the French edition) is a German arms dealer who appears in The Broken Ear. He sells weapons to both sides of the conflict between San Theodoros and neighbouring Nuevo-Rico. He also works with his associate Mr. Trickler in an attempt to bring an end to their mutual enemy Tintin. Herg√©'s Basil Bazarov was \\"characterised in every detail\\" by the real life Greek Vickers arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who profited by selling weapons to both sides of the conflict between Bolivia and neighbouring Paraguay during the War of the Gran Chaco (in The Broken Ear, Bazarov fuels the \\"War of the Gran Chapo\\"). Sir Basil Zaharoff enjoyed a good reputation at the time The Broken Ear appeared; he was made a Grand-officier de la L√©gion d'honneur and made member of the Order of the British Empire. =Big Chief Keen-eyed-Mole= Big Chief Keen-eyed Mole is the sachem of the Blackfoot Native Americans in the United States and is convinced by crime boss Bobby Smiles that Tintin is attempting to steal their land. He addresses Tintin as \\"paleface\\" and plans to execute him using a tomahawk. Tintin then flicks resin at the Chief, who believes that it was done by other members of the tribe using slingshots, and escapes while they all exchange blows. After coming around, Keen-eyed Mole realises that Tintin discovered the secret cave after Smiles speaks with him. He decides to leave the reporter in the hole, and is last seen being forced to leave by the military after an oil discovery in the area. =Bird brothers= () The Bird brothers, Max and G. Bird () are the main adversaries in The Secret of the Unicorn. They are antique dealers who learn about a treasure left by the pirate Red Rackham, and are willing to kill in order to possess it. In the original French, their names are Loiseau (French for \\"the bird\\"). Maxime is renamed Max in the English version. In the Golden Books edition (American English), their name is spelled Byrd. The Bird brothers, like Tintin, are looking for the three parchments from Sir Francis Haddock that hold the secret of Red Rackham's Treasure. They operate from their manor, Marlinspike Hall, where at one point they hold Tintin prisoner to force him to surrender the parchments. Furthermore, they threaten him with torture while refusing to accept Tintin's explanation that a pickpocket had earlier stolen his wallet containing the parchments. Amongst their other crimes is the attempted murder of their helper, Barnaby, just before he can tell Tintin of their plot. The Bird brothers are eventually captured by Thomson and Thompson. Max escapes, but is later caught while trying to flee the country. In Red Rackham's Treasure, Max Bird is said to have escaped again and is spotted near the Sirius, a ship about to set sail with Tintin and Haddock in their search for the treasure. Thomson and Thompson are thus sent as part of the expedition in order to look out for him, but he never appears. The detectives conclude at the end of the adventure that he was discouraged because of their presence. At one point of the early development of what became Tintin in Tibet, Herg√© originally considered bringing back the Bird brothers in a story in which they frame Nestor for a crime he did not commit. However, Herg√© dismissed the idea. The Bird brothers have not been seen since, though they were depicted in sketches for the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art, in which they are at the inauguration of Ram√≥ Nash's art exposition. The Bird Brothers are appear again in The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn Game (Console Version). In the game, they are appear in Marlinspike Hall. =Bobby Smiles= Bobby Smiles is a Chicago crime boss whose rival is Al Capone (Tintin in America). Smiles flees Chicago into America's wild west, and even manages to convince the Native Americans to turn against Tintin. He is eventually captured and brought to justice. In the animated series, Smiles works for Capone, rather than against him. =Bohlwinkel= Mr. Bohlwinkel is a financier from the fictitious South American country S√£o Rico, who appears in The Shooting Star. As the owner of a major banking concern and a petroleum firm called Golden Oil, he uses his wealth and resources to attempt to beat Tintin and his friends in the race to find a recently fallen meteorite. Apart from financing the exploratory vessel Peary, he unsuccessfully attempts to sabotage the competing expedition's ship Aurora, helmed by Captain Haddock. This includes depositing lit dynamite onto its deck (which Snowy puts out), instructing another ship under his control to ram the Aurora during a storm, refusing to allow the Aurora to refuel at a Golden Oil depot (only to have Haddock's old friend Captain Chester fuel the Aurora by siphoning oil being pumped into his tanks), and sending a fake S.O.S. to throw the Aurora off course (Tintin contacting multiple shipping agencies to determine that the ship and company that sent the distress call do not exist). The Shooting Star ends with a dismayed Bohlwinkel listening to a radio announcement that reveals that the police are onto him. Bohlwinkel has physical traits reflecting a stereotypical Jew in Nazi propaganda. In the original edition of The Shooting Star published during World War II, he was named Blumenstein, an American Jew from a bank in New York. For the later edition of the book, Herg√© altered the financier's antecedents by relocating him to the fictitious South American country S√£o Rico and changing his name to a Brabantian dialect word for \\"sweet shop\\": bollewinkel, also modifying the spelling of the new name. After the edition was published, Herg√© subsequently learnt that Bohlwinkel is a Jewish surname. =Chiquito= Chiquito, or Rupac Inca Huaco, is a full-blooded Peruvian Quechua and one of the last descendants of the Incas. He is first seen as the sidekick to General Alcazar in The Seven Crystal Balls and is ultimately seen as a leading member of the Incas in Prisoners of the Sun. He assists General Alcazar in his knife-throwing act, but this serves as a cover since Chiquito, unknown to the General, is out to punish the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members who violated the tomb of his ancestors. He does so by breaking into the homes or offices of the explorers and breaking crystal balls in their presence. The balls contain a coca-derived drug that plunges them into a deep sleep. One night, at the home of Calculus's friend Professor Tarragon, Chiquito breaks the final crystal ball in Tarragon's room after climbing down his chimney. He also seizes the jewellery of Rascar Capac, the Inca mummy whose tomb was violated by the expedition members. As he escapes, he is shot and wounded by a police officer and hides in a tree. In the morning, Calculus finds a bracelet that belonged to Rascar Capac and puts it on. He is promptly kidnapped by Chiquito and his men for sacrilege. To get past a roadblock, he and his accomplices switch cars. Chiquito takes the professor to Peru and Tintin and Captain Haddock go after them. He reappears in Prisoners of the Sun on the Pachacamac and catches Tintin who has swam aboard and found Calculus. When Chiquito calls for assistance, Tintin takes the opportunity to jump back into the water, swimming back to safety as Chiquito shoots at him. Their next meeting is at the Temple of the Sun, high in the mountains, where he and the Incas perform the ceremony of burning Tintin and his friends at the stake, only to be interrupted by a solar eclipse. He eventually releases his control over the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members by order of the Prince of the Sun. =Dawson= Mr. J.M. Dawson is the corrupt British Chief of Police of the Shanghai International Settlement in The Blue Lotus. In revenge for Tintin's rebuking of his American friend, businessman Mr. Gibbons, Dawson has sikh prison guards assault Tintin. Dawson then plots with Mr. Mitsuhirato and turns Tintin over to the Japanese, who have put a price on his head, calmly dismissing Tintin's protest that he is on neutral ground. Dawson is ultimately forced to attend the ceremony in honour of Tintin. Appearing in a more sinister role in The Red Sea Sharks, Dawson sells weapons to both General Alcazar and General Tapioca using the pseudonym Mr. Debrett (), and is being patronised by Rastapopoulos. He has Tintin and Captain Haddock denied entry to Khemed and plants a bomb on their return plane. Dawson's plan ultimately fails. Although he does not reappear after this, Dawson is depicted in some sketches of the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art, in which he is at the inauguration of Ram√≥ Nash's art exposition. In the animated series, Dawson's role is highly reduced. He speaks only briefly with first Mitsuhirato (by phone), and then Thomson and Thompson (in person). He does not appear to have anything more than an informal alliance with Mitsuhirato, as he only agrees to help arrest Tintin on trumped-up charges. =Corporal Diaz= Corporal Diaz was a colonel for General Alcazar until Alcazar demoted him to corporal, replacing him with Tintin, after Diaz complained to the general that San Theodoros had too many colonels and too few corporals (The Broken Ear). In revenge, Diaz engaged in repeated, unsuccessful assassination attempts against Alcazar. Diaz expired in the last attempt when the bomb he planted exploded prematurely. Alcazar had just arrested and sentenced Tintin to death due to faked evidence, and had just promoted Corporal Diaz back to colonel. =Endaddine Akass= Endaddine Akass is a guru and main antagonist of the unfinished book Tintin and Alph-Art, the last of The Adventures of Tintin by Herg√©. An odd-looking man with a large nose, long hair, beard, moustache, and large spectacles, Endaddine Akass holds a conference on \\"Health and Magnetism\\" for crowds of followers including Bianca Castafiore. Tintin recognises his voice. He could be Dr. M√ºller or Max Bird, but more than likely he is Rastapopoulos in disguise. His name, like many in the series, is based upon the Brussels patois marols. =The fakir= The fakir is the loincloth-wearing ascetic appearing in Cigars of the Pharaoh as a high-ranking member of an opium smuggling ring. He shoots darts soaked in the dangerous Rajaijah juice that drives people mad. Among his talents are hypnosis, the Indian rope trick, and escapology (to the point where he is offended by Tintin thinking he could tie him up). He is eventually captured when the leader accidentally knocks him out with a rock that had been intended for Tintin. When the Blue Lotus was originally published in black-and-white, the fakir tells his boss on the phone how he intends to bribe an asylum guard into arranging Tintin's \\"suicide\\". It is also later hinted that he is the chairman of the meeting of the hooded leaders of the drug cartel. In the sequel The Blue Lotus, the fakir escapes from prison and again uses his darts to poison a Chinese man sent to warn Tintin against Mitsuhirato, another leader of the drug smugglers. In that title's original black-and-white version, the fakir can be seen escaping through the forest with his blowpipe after shooting the dart at the Chinese man. Not taking any chances, Tintin tells the Maharaja of Gaipajama he will not leave until he knows the fakir is unable to do him any harm. The next day they receive a telegram from the police announcing the fakir had been recaptured. =Gibbons= Mr. W.R. Gibbons is an American steel trader in The Blue Lotus. Gibbons is portrayed as an overweight, loud-mouthed, racist bigot. He is rude and abusive to a Chinese rickshaw driver, prompting Tintin to intercede. Gibbons also physically assaults a Chinese waiter at the \\"Occidental Private Club\\". He reports Tintin to the Japanese authorities in retaliation only to be arrested as a liar when his information is found inaccurate. He is a friend of the Shanghai police chief Dawson who arranges for Gibbons to be released in return for expelling Tintin from the International Settlement into Japanese hands. In the unfinished adventure Tintin and Alph-Art, Haddock and Tintin visit Bianca Castafiore at an island villa. There they meet a number of guests, including Mr. Gibbons; \\"He's in import-export\\", Castafiore says. =The gunrunner= The gunrunner, who appears in Cigars of the Pharaoh, is an arms trafficker who rescues Tintin from a storm at sea, then turns him over to his enemies when Tintin discovers his weapons of contraband. After he and his men learn that Thomson and Thompson are about to board his ship, he escapes. He is based on the real life French gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, a writer and adventurer whom Herg√© initially admired. When Herg√© learnt that Monfreid was providing guns for war, his attitude about him changed. =Hans Boehm= Hans Boehm, who appears briefly in Flight 714 to Sydney, is one of the pilots and hijackers of that flight. Rastapopoulos planned to eliminate him and the other conspirators. =Huascar= Huascar, in Prisoners of the Sun, is one of the last descendants of the Incas, who worship the Sun in a hidden city in the mountains. Wearing a hat and poncho, Huascar watches Tintin and Captain Haddock when they arrive in Peru to rescue Professor Calculus. He listens in on their conversation with the chief of police and follows them through the streets of Callao. At Santa- Clara, he arranges a train \\"accident\\" that nearly gets them killed by threatening a guard with the consequences of disobeying the orders of the Inca. At Jauga, however, he sees Tintin defending a young orange seller named Zorrino from two white men. Surprised that a white foreigner such as Tintin should do such a selfless act, he advises him to stop searching for Calculus since he will be risking his life. Tintin states he will continue anyway, so Huascar gives him a talisman that he claims can keep danger away. Later captured by the Incas, Tintin gives the talisman to Zorrino. The Incas, who intend to kill them for treachery, see the talisman and spare the younger boy's life. Present at the scene, Huascar is revealed to be a High Priest of the Sun. He uses a large magnifying glass to set fire to the stake used to burn the westerners, but is thwarted by a solar eclipse that leads to their release. Prisoners of the Sun, originally published in Tintin magazine with additional panels not included later in book form, included a scene with Huascar. In the magazine version, Tintin and Haddock are at the bridge waiting for an unknown guide when they meet Huascar, who tells them that their guide has gotten sick. He smiles at Haddock's insults and walks away. Zorrino then calls them over to the bridge. He claims that Huascar took him prisoner but that he escaped. Huascar is not to be confused with the more ruthless Chiquito who bears a close resemblance to him. =Ivan= Ivan is a character who appears in The Black Island. He is a chauffeur and henchman of the villainous psychiatrist Dr. M√ºller, involved in counterfeit money trafficking. He is knocked out, tied and gagged by Tintin at the Black Island, but is later released by Puschov to plot against Tintin, then is finally taken into custody by the police. =Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (2011 Film)= He is the main Antagonist of \\"The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn\\" who work with Tom and Allan =Colonel Jorgen= Colonel Boris Jorgen is a sworn enemy of Tintin. They first meet in King Ottokar's Sceptre, where he is known as Colonel Boris and is a relatively minor character, supposedly in the service of King Muskar XII as his aide-de-camp. In fact, Jorgen is one of a number of Syldavian conspirators seeking to overthrow the king, in collaboration with the neighbouring republic of Borduria. As such, the colonel is in direct contact with the Central Committee of the revolutionary Iron Guard movement. Tintin delivers a humiliating knockout punch to him shortly before the Bordurian plot is foiled. Colonel Jorgen returns in Destination Moon and confronts Tintin again in Explorers on the Moon, having stowed away on the moon rocket that Tintin and his friends are piloting. Frank Wolff was told he would be a journalist; Jorgen reveals his true plan to steal the rocket when on the moon. When most of the group leaves on the moon-tank, Jorgen knocks Tintin out from behind, ties him up, and leaves him on a lower deck. He forces Wolff to help him maroon the others on the moon, but is prevented from doing so by Tintin, who severs the wires to the engine and holds Jorgen at gunpoint. Jorgen escapes custody during the return flight and attempts to kill the rocket crew. Wolff turns on Jorgen for this, and in the ensuing struggle, Jorgen is inadvertently shot, dying instantly. His body is subsequently ejected into space. =Jumbo= Jumbo is a henchman of Allan while aboard the Karaboudjan in The Crab with the Golden Claws. Allan asks him to watch for Tintin to return through a porthole window, while Tintin emerges instead from his hiding place under the bed. Allan returns to find him tied up with ropes. Jumbo was a black African man in the original serialisations, but Herg√©'s American publishers objected to any depiction of the mixing of races. Herg√© redrew Jumbo and another sailor as Arab but kept the accompanying text intact, which resulted in Haddock continuing to refer to the Arab man as a \\"Negro\\". =Dr. Krollspell= Dr. Krollspell is a German doctor and associate of Tintin's enemy Rastapopoulos in Flight 714 to Sydney, but he later changes sides when it is in his best interest to turn from his employer. Krollspell is an ex-Nazi scientist, probably based on Josef Mengele or Adolf Hitler's personal doctor, Theodor Morell. In an interview, Herg√© himself suggested that Krollspell had worked in a concentration camp‚ÄîFlight 714 to Sydney having been published some 20 years after the war. The name \\"Krollspell\\" is Brussels dialect for krulspeld, which means \\"hair curler\\". Dr. Krollspell is the head of a psychiatric clinic in New Delhi (Cairo in the English version). He developed a truth serum that Rastapopoulos intends to use on kidnapped millionaire Laszlo Carreidas in order to learn where Carreidas had left a large part of his personal fortune. However, when Rastapopoulos was injected with the serum by accident and \\"confessed\\" that he planned to eliminate Krollspell rather than pay him for his assistance, Krollspell joined forces with Tintin and his allies to try to escape from the island. Before the eruption of the volcano, Krollspell is taken away by the aliens along with Rastapopoulos and his gang. By the end of the adventure, a news programme announces that Krollspell was found near his clinic with no memory of how he got there. Krollspell is depicted in some sketches of the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art. =Kr√¥nik and Kl√ªmsi= () Kr√¥nik and Kl√ªmsi are inept Bordurian ZEP Secret Police agents ostensibly assigned by Colonel Sponsz to ensure Tintin and Captain Haddock's safety and well-being during their visit to the Bordurian capital Szoh√¥d in The Calculus Affair. Their real objective is to prevent the two visitors from making indiscreet inquiries in their hunt for Professor Calculus. Tintin and Haddock neutralise the agents by plying them with drinks at dinner and then locking them in their respective hotel rooms. Their names are undoubtedly puns on \\"chronic\\" and \\"clumsy\\". They appear to be the Bordurian equivalents of Thomson and Thompson. =Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch= () Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch is dictator of the fictional regime of Borduria. Although he never appears as a character in the series, he is mentioned by name and glimpsed in statues and portraits in The Calculus Affair and Tintin and the Picaros. His English name is an allusion to his curved moustache, which also appears as a stylised circumflex mark in the Bordurian language (an example can be seen in his name). Bordurians are often heard swearing \\"by the whiskers of K√ªrvi-Tasch\\". The original French name is an allusion to plexiglass. K√ªrvi-Tasch's Bordurian government closely resembles the Nazi regime. The usage of the country's national insignia (naturally resembling the marshal's moustache) on badges and armbands is similar to the swastika. The greeting \\"Ama√Øh K√ªrvi-Tasch\\" (meaning \\"Hail K√ªrvi-Tasch\\") is similar to \\"Heil Hitler!\\" =Miller= Miller is the calculating spymaster from an unnamed power who masterminds the plot to hijack the Syldavian rocket programme in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. He was the man who offered to help Frank Wolff out of his gambling debts in exchange for information on the rocket programme: Miller is shown in one panel checking a list of personnel at the Centre and finds Wolff's name among them. Miller is first seen on the plane to Syldavia in Destination Moon. He was seated in the row ahead of Tintin and Captain Haddock and was astonished to hear the Captain mention the name \\"Calculus\\", showing that he was already planning to take over the moon programme that Calculus was working on. He discreetly followed Tintin and Haddock through Klow airport but pulled back when he realised that they were being escorted by Zepo, the local secret police. With an associate known as the Baron, he then set about parachuting agents into the area of the Centre and obtaining the plans for the experimental unmanned rocket X-FLR6. When X-FLR6 was launched, Miller's technicians were able to intercept it and divert the rocket to their own territory. However, Tintin and Calculus had expected this and destroyed the rocket before it could land. Miller threatened to have Wolff killed, as he suspected him of double-crossing him, but refrained when it was announced that a manned rocket was to go to the moon. Miller arranged for Colonel Jorgen, an old enemy of Tintin's, to be smuggled aboard. Ultimately though, his attempt to control the rocket failed‚Äîhis agents Jorgen and Wolff both perishing in the process. Miller is last seen cursing the rocket's crew and his agents' bungling, wishing that they would all perish in the last stage of the return journey. Like any good spymaster, Miller designated various codenames to his targets and operations: the Centre was referred to as the \\"Main Workshop\\"; Calculus and Haddock were \\"Mammoth\\" and \\"Whale\\"; and the operation to hijack the manned rocket to the moon was called \\"Ulysses\\" (after the Greek hero who also goes on an epic journey and is himself a master of intrigue and deception). =Mitsuhirato= Mitsuhirato is a Japanese double agent who appears in The Blue Lotus. He owns a women's clothing shop on the Street of Tranquility in Shanghai and appears friendly to Tintin, but Mitsuhirato also plots with Dawson and is involved in a drug trafficking cabal with Rastapopoulos while working for the Japanese government. Mitsuhirato is characterised as an evil, scheming person, exploiting political turmoil in China to his and his country's advantage. He is depicted as unscrupulous and militaristic, with stereotypically rectangular teeth. After his subsequent capture at the end of The Blue Lotus, he committed suicide by hara-kiri. =Dr. M√ºller= Dr. J. W. M√ºller is the evil German psychiatrist whose position and qualifications serve as a cover for more villainous activities, including mistreatment of patients, counterfeiting, and later criminal mercenary. Herg√© considered M√ºller \\"a Rastapopoulos figure prepared to risk his own life.\\" M√ºller frequently uses profanities such as \\"Kruzit√ºrken\\" that are of Bavarian origin, suggesting his background to be Bavarian or Austrian, but he could also be Swiss or South-Tirolian. As with Rastapopoulos, his true nationality is never revealed. M√ºller's first appearance is in The Black Island where he is in league with English and Scottish counterfeiters. He tries to send Tintin to his psychiatric clinic, but Tintin defeats him and M√ºller accidentally burns his own house. He and his henchman Ivan manage to recover some of the counterfeit money and fly away to the Black Island. Once there, Tintin knocks out and gags M√ºller, but he is subsequently released by his employer Puschov and the other members of the counterfeit gang. M√ºller is ultimately taken into custody. Dr. M√ºller also appears in Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. In both, he helps the rebel Bab El Ehr in his attempts to overthrow the Emir, Ben Kalish Ezab. He designed Formula Fourteen, which increased the explosive properties of petrol, and sabotaged the pipelines of Arabex, the Emir's preferred petrol company. While in his initial appearance he wore a goatee and moustache and had a plump physique, in later appearances he wears a full-grown beard and is leaner, enabling him to pose as an Arab. In The Red Sea Sharks, he had changed his name to Mull Pasha (shown in the pile of newspaper clippings near the end of the adventure, and a clear reference to Glubb Pasha, the idiosyncratic British commander of the Arab legion who operated out of Jordan during the Second World War). Once Bab el Ehr is overthrown, Dr. M√ºller is also captured. Dr. M√ºller is based on Dr. , a Nazi counterfeiter of Scottish descent whom Herg√© had learnt about from the February 1934 issue of Le Crapouillot, a source of information for him at the time. Dr. Bell was linked to the Nazi party at its highest levels and was involved in a plot to destabilise Soviet Russia through counterfeiting Russian roubles. =M√ºsstler= M√ºsstler is the unseen powerful despot in King Ottokar's Sceptre; a Syldavian political agitator and leader of the \\"Iron Guard\\", cover for the ZZRK (Syldavian Central Revolutionary Committee). He plots the deposition of the Syldavian king and the annexation of the country by Borduria. Herg√© arrived at the character's name by combining the surnames of Italy's National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. M√ºsstler's group, the Iron Guard, is named after a Romanian fascist group. Bordurian officers wear uniforms based on those of the German SS. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid√®s of Stanford University asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel Fran√ßois de La Rocque's Croix-de-Feu, noting that the figure of M√ºsstler was \\"the Evil One without a face\\". =Omar Ben Salaad= Omar Ben Salaad is a wealthy Arab merchant based in the fictional port city of Bagghar in French Morocco, who appears in The Crab with the Golden Claws. A shopkeeper claims he is the wealthiest man in Bagghar. He is seen to own a palace with servants, horses, cars, huge amounts of land, and a plane. Tintin, however, discovers him to be behind an opium trafficking ring, which uses tins of crab to smuggle the drug. When Tintin was captured early in the adventure, it was Salaad who wired the initial order to have Tintin thrown overboard, but Tintin's escape prevented it. Later, Tintin discovers the base where the opium is stored is in Salaad's cellar, with an entrance behind a bookcase. Salaad tries to shoot Tintin but is knocked out when Snowy bites him, causing him to shoot a chandelier onto himself, and is arrested. It is later revealed that his activities went all the way to the Far East. Omar Ben Salaad's city Bagghar sounds like bagarre, the French word for \\"fight\\" or \\"brawl\\". \\"Omar\\" is a common Arabic name, but Omar Salaad also sounds like homard salade (\\"lobster salad\\"). Omar Ben Salaad is portrayed by Gad Elmaleh in the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn; however, in the film he has no part in any conspiracy, merely owning a palace at which Bianca Castafiore performs. =Pablo= Pablo is a native of San Theodoros and lives in the capital Los Dopicos. His first appearance is in The Broken Ear, in which the adventure's villain Mr. Trickler hires him to bring an end to Tintin. Pablo's attempt fails; Tintin captures Pablo, who begs for mercy, and Tintin lets him go. Trickler then frames Tintin for espionage and the young man is soon sentenced to death. Pablo, grateful that Tintin spared his life, assembles a gang of men, breaks into the prison, and frees Tintin and Snowy. In the 1935 serialised version, Pablo's full name was given as Juan Paolino, the Terror of Los Dopicos and best shooter in the country. Pablo returned in Tintin and the Picaros, where he appeared to help Tintin and his friends escape their current captivity, but really putting them in a position where they could be shot while trying to escape. When Tintin discovered his treachery, he allowed Pablo to go free, as he remembered Pablo once saved his life. =Paolo Colombani= Paolo Colombani, is Skut's Co-pilot and hijacker of that flight. Rastapopoulos planned to eliminate him and the other conspirators. =Puschov= () Puschov is leader of the international gang of banknote counterfeiters in The Black Island, handler of Ranko the gorilla and superior to Dr. M√ºller. He is a cunning and deceptive figure, framing Tintin for the assault on the train, tricking Tintin when he \\"returns from the dead\\" (he falls on his knees and begs the \\"ghost\\" for mercy, only to trip him and acquire his gun). He wields Ranko against his pursuers. He is handcuffed by Tintin, but he manages to escape and release the other members of the counterfeit gang. He and his allies are ultimately taken into custody. =Ranko= Ranko is a gorilla who is used by Puschov, employer of Dr. M√ºller, to frighten inquisitive intruders away from The Black Island, where forgers are printing counterfeit banknotes off the Scottish coast. At first, Ranko seems very fierce and bloodthirsty, but he is easily controlled by Snowy's barking, which terrifies him. He develops an affection for Tintin after receiving first aid from him for a broken arm. He is later sent to a zoo to be cared for. =Rascar Capac= Rascar Capac is the Incan mummy in The Seven Crystal Balls. He is an ancient Incan monarch dug up by the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members. Professor Tarragon displays the mummy in his home. When lightning strikes into the chimney, it sends a fireball hurtling through the living room and into Rascar Capac, vaporizing him. That night, Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus all have the same nightmare: Rascar Capac climbs into the room carrying a crystal ball and smashes it onto the floor. The mummy is not seen again. =Red Rackham= () Red Rackham is the pirate who attacks the Unicorn, the ship captained by Sir Francis Haddock (Captain Haddock's ancestor). Rackham engages Haddock in battle, resulting in the almost total destruction of Rackham's ship. As his ship is sinking, Rackham and his men board the Unicorn and manage to gain control of the vessel. Haddock is captured and tied to the ship's mast and the crew is cast overboard. Rackham intends to have Haddock tortured by his men the following day, but before he can, Sir Francis frees himself and they engage in single combat using cutlasses. Rackham is killed in the duel and Sir Francis manages to blow up the Unicorn and get away safely. The character Red Rackham was based on the 17th century buccaneers John \\"Calico Jack\\" Rackham, Blackbeard, and Montbars the Exterminator. In the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, it is revealed that Red Rackham is the ancestor of Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine. Red Rackham is portrayed by Daniel Craig (who also portrays Sakharine). =The Sondonesians= The Sondonesians are the fictional Southeast Asian people who appear in Flight 714 to Sydney. The name sounds similar to \\"Indonesians\\" and may also refer to the Indonesian Sunda Islands. Rastapopoulos hires the Sondonesians as mercenaries to collaborate in his scheme to steal the fortune of Laszlo Carreidas, explaining that he will help them in their war for independence. They assist in capturing Carreidas' plane and diverting it to an Indonesian island, keeping the passengers and pilot imprisoned in old Japanese WWII bunkers. Rastapopoulos has mined the Sondonesians' junks so that they will be eliminated. When Allan corners Tintin and his entourage in a cave, the Sondonesians refuse to enter, pointing to signs the gods have left on the cave threatening punishment for anyone who enters. In fact, these \\"gods\\" are extraterrestrials who have been visiting the island for years, and a landing of theirs had occurred just the previous night, as signified by strange lights in the sky that frightened the Sondonesians. When the main characters meet Mik Kanrokitoff, he explains that he has hypnotised and freed the Sondonesian guards (whom Tintin and Captain Haddock had bound and gagged) and let them spread fear among their compatriots. When an earthquake occurs shortly afterwards, the Sondonesians' nerves are finally stressed beyond their breaking point. Allan frantically attempts to stop them, but they assault him and flee the island. Herg√© depicts the Sondonesians using the real Indonesian language. While on duty, two of Tintin's captors talk about a particular Indonesian dish that originated in Java: sambal ulek (ground chili sauce with shrimp paste). =Spalding= Spalding appears in Flight 714 to Sydney; he is the British secretary for millionaire Laszlo Carreidas and is one of the hijackers of that flight. Captain Haddock mistakes him for Carreidas when they first meet. Rastapopoulos planned to eliminate him and the other conspirators. He is finally seen being abducted by the aliens and brought to an unknown fate. In an interview with the Sunday Times in 1968, Herg√© is quoted as saying that Spalding was \\"a British public school man, obviously the black sheep of his family\\". Spalding has a formal manner, stiff upper lip, and fashionable clothes. =Colonel Sponsz= Colonel Sponsz is the monocle-wearing military official and Chief of Police of the Bordurian capital Szoh√¥d, as well as head of the ZEP Secret Police, which operates on behalf of the country's dictator Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch. He first appears in The Calculus Affair; he is the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Professor Calculus by ZEP to force Calculus to use his research on ultrasonic waves to create a weapon of mass destruction. He also arranges for Tintin and Captain Haddock, who are attempting to rescue Calculus, to be shadowed by ZEP agents Kr√¥nik and Kl√ªmsi, who pose as translators. After Tintin and Haddock escape from Kr√¥nik and Kl√ªmsi and hide in the Opera, Sponsz orders the police to surround the Opera while going to hear Bianca Castafiore sing. Unbeknownst to Sponsz, Tintin and Haddock are hiding in Castafiore's closet when Sponsz visits her in her dressing room. The two protagonists thus hear the entirety of the Bordurian plan for Calculus. Tintin and Haddock also manage to steal passes for two Red Cross representatives and a release order for Calculus from Sponsz's coat; they use these and some disguises obtained from the Opera to sneak Calculus out of the fortress of Bakhine, into neighbouring Syldavia, and home. Sponsz reappears in Tintin and the Picaros. In this adventure, he has been assigned by Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch as a technical adviser to General Tapioca, the new ruler of San Theodoros, and is tasked with reorganising the Secret Police there. In San Theodoros, he takes the Spanish spelling of his name, Esponja. Sponsz plants false documents in Bianca Castafiore's luggage, which provides \\"proof\\" of a conspiracy led by her against General Tapioca, justifying the arrest of Castafiore. Sponsz later arrests Thomson and Thompson as well. Humiliated by Tintin in The Calculus Affair, Colonel Sponsz aims for the entrapment and capture of Tintin and Captain Haddock, whom he knows will come to the rescue of Castafiore. He then uses Pablo, Tintin's ally in The Broken Ear but now a double agent for Tapioca in the camp of General Alcazar and the Picaros, to set up a second trap for Tintin, Haddock, Calculus, and General Alcazar. Sponsz appears again in the end of the adventure, as he is captured by the Picaros along with General Tapioca and is exiled and sent back to Borduria. Herg√© used his own brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim. =Mr. and Mrs Snowball= Mr. and Mrs. Snowball are members of the secret organization Kih-Oskh, a gang of international opium-smugglers in Cigars of the Pharaoh. During the evening-party at the Major's Indian country house, the lady faints, thinking she saw a ghost. But it is actually Sophocles Sarcophagus, wrapped in a white sheet. Mrs. Snowball is the only woman among the seven persons who meet in the secret hiding-place of the organization. The lady, with her characteristic haircut, may appear anonymously in the albums The Calculus Affair (pages 45, 46, 49 and 52), The Red Sea Sharks (p. 1) and Tintin in Tibet (p. 2), but the resemblance can be fortuitous. Her husband looks different in these cases. =General Tapioca= General Tapioca is the arch-rival of General Alcazar. Tapioca and Alcazar are both generals in their armies in the banana republic of San Theodoros during The Broken Ear. He and Alcazar depose each other and assume dictatorial leadership of the country with comedic frequency. In The Seven Crystal Balls, Tapioca has exiled Alcazar from San Theodoros, taking his role as the dictator of the country. By The Red Sea Sharks, Dawson is selling planes to Tapioca and to Alcazar. At the end of the adventure, a newspaper clipping reports that Alcazar has again ousted Tapioca. In Tintin and the Picaros, Tapioca is now being helped by Colonel Sponsz of Borduria, an old foe of Tintin and Captain Haddock, who was assigned by Marshal K√ªrvi-Tasch to San Theodoros and serve as Tapioca's technical adviser. General Tapioca's regime is overthrown by Alcazar with the help of Tintin and Captain Haddock. Although Tapioca approves of Alcazar's plan to execute him, he and Alcazar both submit to Tintin's petition to spare Tapioca and exile him to Borduria. =Trickler= () Mr. R.W. Trickler is an unscrupulous American businessman in The Broken Ear who represents General American Oil in the South American republic of San Theodoros. Trickler attempts to engineer a war in order for San Theodoros to seize total control of the supposedly oil-rich Gran Chapo region from neighbouring Nuevo-Rico and hand it over to his company. He further seeks to profit even more through the sale of arms by his associate Basil Bazarov to both countries. Trickler tries unsuccessfully to bribe Tintin into convincing General Alcazar to start a war against Nuevo-Rico. When that fails, he tries to have Tintin assassinated and bribes Alcazar in person, then has Tintin framed as a spy and nearly executed. At the end of the adventure, it turns out the Gran Chapo region has no trace of oil. He appears anonymously in The Calculus Affair (page 47), staying in hotel Zsnorr; presumably he is in arms traffic. In the unfinished adventure Tintin and Alph-Art, Haddock and Tintin visit Bianca Castafiore at an island villa. There they meet a number of guests, including Mr. Trickler; \\"Director of an important oil company\\", Castafiore says. Supporting characters A panel from The Castafiore Emerald, showing some of the supporting characters of The Adventures of Tintin. From left to right: Irma and Igor Wagner being introduced by Bianca Castafiore to Captain Haddock and Tintin =Abdullah= Abdullah is the spoiled, mischievous young prince of the fictional Arabian state of Khemed, whose father is Ben Kalish Ezab, the Emir. He first appears in Land of Black Gold, then in The Red Sea Sharks when the Emir entrusts his son to Tintin's care. Prince Abdullah is based on the young King Faisal II of Iraq. Abdullah is a serial practical joker whose favourite victim is the short-tempered Captain Haddock. He is doted upon by his father. Abdullah has a tendency to dislike people and promise punishments from his father to everyone who annoys him‚Äîeven as he is playing pranks on them. He begins to heavily like Captain Haddock, however, as he finds his tantrums and general behaviour hilarious. =General Alcazar= General Alcazar is a friend of Tintin and is the occasional dictator of the fictional banana republic of San Theodoros. He is involved in a never-ending struggle for power with his arch-rival General Tapioca. Both men claim leadership of the country and rename its capital after themselves upon arriving in power. Alcazar controls the Presidential Palace of Los Dopicos in The Broken Ear, but loses power and becomes a cabaret act in Europe under the stage name Ram√≥n Zarate by the time of The Seven Crystal Balls. In The Red Sea Sharks, Alcazar is discovered to be buying weapons from Dawson in an illegal arms deal. Finally, in Tintin and the Picaros, Alcazar has returned to his country and is finding it difficult to lead the Picaros on a guerrilla operation in the tropical forest while married to a harridan who bullies him. Tintin, though uninterested in his cause, devises a stratagem to return him to power in order to rescue his friends. Alcazar is once again in charge of San Theodoros, but it is suggested that he and Tapioca are interchangeable. =Peggy Alcazar= Peggy Alcazar is the wife of General Alcazar in Tintin and the Picaros. Appearing first in hair curlers and later with an age-inappropriate high ponytail, she dominates General Alcazar and makes him do the housework. =Professor Alembick= () Professor Hector Alembick is a sigillographer: an expert on seals used to authenticate state documents. He appears as a bespectacled, chain-smoking academic in King Ottokar's Sceptre when Tintin meets him when returning a briefcase the professor had left on a park bench. Professor Alembick tells Tintin of his desire to visit Syldavia to research an ancient seal belonging to the Syldavian monarch King Ottokar IV. Tintin offers to be Alembick's secretary on his journey. On the day before the trip, Alembick calls Tintin by telephone; in the midst of the conversation Tintin hears a struggle and a cry for help before the connection is cut short. When Tintin rushes to the professor's apartment to investigate, he is startled to find the professor calmly packing his bags. Although Alembick's appearance seems unchanged, subtle changes in his behaviour, such as no longer requiring cigarettes or eyeglasses, lead Tintin to suspect that something is amiss. At the end of the adventure, Tintin discovers that Professor Hector Alembick had indeed been kidnapped and impersonated by his twin brother Alfred. Professor Alembick's name is a pun on alembic, an alchemical still. =Alfredo Topolino= Alfredo Topolino is a Swiss expert in ultrasonics residing in Nyon, Switzerland, who appears in The Calculus Affair. An acquaintance of Professor Calculus, he survives first an assault on his doorstep then the destruction of his house by Bordurian agents interested in Calculus's work. His manservant Boris works for the secret service of that country. His last name means \\"little mouse\\" in Italian. =Aristides Silk= () Aristides Silk is a pickpocket who becomes a pivotal character in The Secret of the Unicorn, inadvertently collecting the parchments leading to Red Rackham's Treasure. Silk claims he is not a thief, but admits he is a kleptomaniac. He explains he adores wallets and displays his large collection, none of which have been emptied of their contents. He is first seen in the market near the beginning of the adventure, moving away from Thomson and Thompson just before they discover that their wallets have been stolen. He later steals Tintin's wallet containing the parchments of Sir Francis Haddock that hold the location of Red Rackham's treasure. He is among the invited guests at the end of that adventure in the Maritime Gallery at Marlinspike Hall. Aristides Silk is portrayed by Toby Jones in the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. =Arturo Benedetto Giovanni Giuseppe Pietro Archangelo Alfredo Cartoffoli da Milano= Arturo Benedetto Giovanni Giuseppe Pietro Archangelo Alfredo Cartoffoli da Milano is the expert Italian driver of a Lancia Aurelia GT in The Calculus Affair. He eagerly helps Tintin and Captain Haddock pursue Syldavian agents who kidnapped Professor Calculus in the adventure's car chase. While speeding through a built-up area in the French Haute Savoie on market day, he was stopped by a gendarme who wanted to record his name. The flabbergasted gendarme meekly let him off with \\"Don't do it again.\\" When they finally stopped the Syldavian car and did not find Calculus inside, Cartoffoli accused Tintin and the Captain of making up their story to get a free ride before zooming away. As an Italian driver, he has great pride in Italian cars, which he claims are the best in the world. =The Arumbayas= The Arumbayas are an indigenous people living in the South American rainforest along the fictional river Coliflor. They first appear in The Broken Ear where, investigating the theft of an Arumbaya fetish with a broken ear, Tintin and Snowy venture into the San Theodoros jungle. The British explorer Ridgewell lives with them. Despite a reputation for ferocity, the Arumbayas prove to be relatively civil when Tintin encounters them. They casually explain that their bad reputation may be due to the actions of their neighbours, the Rumbabas, who behead anyone who passes their way. =Mr. Baxter= Mr. Baxter is the Director General of the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre, appearing in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. He is humble, refusing to go to the Moon in Captain Haddock's place when it is offered it to him, and he works well with Professor Calculus, whom he supports completely. He misses most of the excitement of the Moon journey, having to stay and man the Centre, but acquires some of it when the returning Moon rocket nearly lands on his car. =Bill the cook= Bill, a ship's cook, is the cook on board the Aurora during The Shooting Star. He then returned as cook on board the Sirius during Red Rackham's Treasure and was the first character seen in that adventure, meeting a friend at a pub before sailing. His indiscreet talk of treasure hunting was overheard by a newspaper reporter, which, after that story was published, caused Tintin and Captain Haddock to be besieged with more newspaper reporters. Bill was beleaguered by both Snowy and Professor Calculus, the former who stole a chicken and the latter who stole a box of biscuits. =Blessed Lightning= Blessed Lightning is a Tibetan Buddhist monk with psychic powers. He occasionally goes into a trance, floats into the air, and is able to see events from the future. In Tintin in Tibet, he foresees Snowy's journey to bring the monks a distress message from Tintin, leading to Tintin's rescue. =Mr. Bolt= () Mr. Bolt is a stonemason who appears in The Castafiore Emerald, hired by Captain Haddock to fix the broken step in Marlinspike Hall, but who repeatedly fails to arrive and instead offers a continuous sequence of excuses. Later, Mr. Bolt is one of the people who send the Captain a telegram when his engagement to marry Bianca Castafiore is erroneously announced. He is also a member of the band that plays outside Marlinspike as part of the \\"celebrations\\". At the end of the adventure, Mr. Bolt finally arrives to fix the broken step, but it is immediately broken again. By the time of Tintin and the Picaros, Mr. Bolt appears to have finally fixed the step. =Bunji Kuraki= Bunji Kuraki is a Japanese detective of the Yokohama police force appearing in The Crab with the Golden Claws. He was investigating a powerful gang of drug smugglers in the Far East and followed their trail to Europe, but was kidnapped from the street outside Tintin's flat before he could warn him. He was finally able to meet Tintin at the end of the adventure after he had been freed by police. =Captain Chester= Captain Chester, an old friend of Captain Haddock, is a gruff merchant skipper with red hair and a bushy red moustache. He first appears in The Shooting Star in Iceland, where he bumps into Captain Haddock at the docks and launches into a bizarre greeting ritual with Haddock that Tintin at first interprets as the build-up to a fight. However, Haddock and Chester warmly clasp hands and take Tintin to a local bar to reminisce over a bottle of whisky. Chester is captain of the Sirius, a merchant trawler, and uses it to secretly refuel Haddock's research vessel in Iceland when their competitors block the supply, allowing his friend to continue his voyage. Chester later lends the Sirius to Haddock when he and Tintin set off to find Red Rackham's Treasure. Chester is briefly mentioned in The Seven Crystal Balls‚ÄîTintin and Haddock attempt to visit him while he is docked at a port‚Äîbut he departs before they arrive. He is one of the people to send Haddock a telegram in The Castafiore Emerald. =Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto= () Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto are a writer and photographer working for the magazine Paris Flash. They first appear in The Castafiore Emerald where, to the fury of Captain Haddock and the amusement of Bianca Castafiore, they write a sensational article for their magazine announcing that the Captain and the Diva are engaged. They later appear briefly in Tintin and the Picaros. They make a cameo appearance in the redrawn version of The Black Island; Willoughby-Drupe is shown interviewing the old man in the pub while Rizotto is in the crowd of reporters welcoming Tintin at the docks (page 61). Herg√© created the pair after being interviewed for Paris Match and finding the resulting piece dubious. =Coco= Coco is a Congolese boy who is Tintin's assistant in Tintin in the Congo. He speaks in an old- fashioned pidgin dialect. Fiercely loyal, he is the one person whom Tintin can fully rely on during his travels there. =Cutts the butcher= () Cutts the butcher runs the local butcher's shop whose phone number of 431 is frequently mistaken for 421 to Marlinspike Hall. As a result, the mansion's inhabitants are endlessly plagued by orders for lamb chops and sausages. The irony is that when making calls himself, Captain Haddock usually ends up getting put through to Cutts' shop, rather than the place he was actually calling. The unseen delivery man from Cutts' butcher shop plays a vital role in The Calculus Affair by offering Professor Calculus a lift to the village just in time to save him from a Bordurian kidnapping attempt. It would appear that Cutts is also the local mayor, since he can be seen dressed very formally along with the local municipal band congratulating Haddock and Bianca Castafiore on their \\"engagement\\" in The Castafiore Emerald. He had one last reference at the start of Tintin and Alph-Art, where a call for him was made. In the original French, the name of the butcher's shop Boucherie Sanzot is a pun. Sanzot sounds like sans os, which means \\"without bones\\". The English translation uses Cutts to make a different pun. Cutts also appeared in a French TV ad for cooking oil with Professor Calculus in 1979. =Lieutenant Delcourt= Lieutenant Delcourt is a character who appears in The Crab with the Golden Claws. He is in command of the outpost of Afghar, in the Sahara desert. He assists Tintin and Captain Haddock on their way to find the missing freighter Karaboudjan. =Professor Euclide= Professor Euclide is an absent-minded professor appearing in The Broken Ear who forgets his glasses, wears his cleaning-lady's overcoat, holds his cane upside down as if it were an umbrella, mistakes a parrot for a man, and leaves his briefcase next to a lamp post. In the original edition published in 1935, his name is given as Professor Euclide (after the Greek mathematician). He is one of Herg√©'s many prototypes for Professor Calculus. =Mrs. Finch= () Mrs. Finch is Tintin's landlady at , where Tintin lived before joining Captain Haddock at Marlinspike Hall. A simple soul, she was badly frightened when Bunji Kuraki of the Yokohama police force was kidnapped from the street outside Tintin's flat during The Crab with the Golden Claws. The address 26 Labrador Road () is also the real-life address of the Mus√©e Herg√©. =Sir Francis Haddock= () Sir Francis Haddock is an ancestor of Captain Haddock. He is a knight and a Ship-of-the-Line Captain in the Royal Navy, commanding the Unicorn under the Union Jack in 1676. In the original French version, he is Chevalier Fran√ßois de Hadoque of the French Royal Navy, commanding la Licorne for King Louis XIV. He was rewarded by the king with the estate of Marlinspike Hall (Moulinsart) in 1685. Sir Francis was forced to scuttle the Unicorn when it was taken by pirate captain Red Rackham. After the Unicorn sank, Sir Francis lived for two years among the natives of the nearby tropical island. Upon returning home, Sir Francis concealed a treasure stolen from Red Rackham in the cellars of Marlinspike Hall, hiding clues to its location in three model ships of the Unicorn that he gave to his three sons. He is mentioned obliquely in Flight 714 to Sydney by the Captain, who says \\"one of my ancestors went in for naval warfare.\\" There are hints that Sir Francis Haddock is an illegitimate son of the French Sun King, Louis XIV, a possible reference to Herg√©'s own family history‚ÄîHerg√© liked to believe that his father was the illegitimate son of the Belgian king Leopold II. Sir Francis Haddock is portrayed by Andy Serkis (who also portrays Captain Haddock) in the motion capture film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. =Frank Wolff= Frank Wolff is the rocket engineer who assists Professor Calculus during the Syldavian expedition to the moon (Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon). In an interview, Herg√© described him as clever, stating he had a PhD in Mathematics with Mechanics and a BEng in Chemical Engineering, but also described him as feeble and quiet. Wolff is ultimately exposed as a spy who was coerced into helping an unnamed foreign power hijack the moon rockets he had helped build, after they learnt of his former compulsive gambling and heavy debt. After refusing to allow the enemy agent Colonel Jorgen to shoot the rest of the rocket crew, his struggle for Jorgen's gun resulted in the agent's accidental death. As the rocket ship is returning to Earth without enough oxygen for Tintin and his friends, Wolff, still overcome with guilt over the way he had betrayed his companions, redeems himself for his past mistakes and sacrifices himself for the survival of the group by throwing himself into space. Even the cynical Captain Haddock, who had, until the last moment, still suspected Wolff of treachery, was moved by his selfless act. =Grand Abbot= The Grand Abbot is head of an order of Tibetan Buddhist monks in Tintin in Tibet, who rescues Tintin and Captain Haddock from the mountains after they succumb to an avalanche. At first discouraging Tintin from his quest, he later presents Tintin with a khata scarf in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang Chong-Chen. =Henri Fourcart= Henri Fourcart is director of Fourcart Gallery that hosts the Alph-Art exhibihion of artist Ram√≥ Nash in Tintin and Alph-Art. When he is introduced to Captain Haddock, he recognises him as the friend of the famous Tintin and requests to meet him. He is killed in a car accident under suspicious circumstances before the meeting can take place. =Igor Wagner= Igor Wagner is the quiet pianist working for Bianca Castafiore. He is driving with his employer when she first encounters Tintin in King Ottokar's Sceptre. He does not contribute to a plotline until The Castafiore Emerald, when he is discovered to be a gambler who bets on races in secret. He has a small moustache and dresses formally in black. After the thievery of Castafiore's emeralds, his attempts to help only incriminate him, as it was his footprints found near Castafiore's window, it was him suspiciously rummaging in the attic, and it was he who broke a step on the staircase. He tries to sneak out of his practice sessions (dictated by Castafiore) and, instead of practising, is caught using a playback tape recorder. He was imprisoned along with Castafiore and Irma in Tintin and the Picaros, before being freed by Tintin. His name is made up of a humorous reference to two well-known composers: Igor Stravinsky and Richard Wagner. =Irma= Irma is the maid of Bianca Castafiore. Irma first appears in The Calculus Affair before appearing in The Castafiore Emerald. Castafiore describes her as a faithful, loyal, and honest servant. Despite giving a meek impression, she has a strong sense of personal pride: when Thomson and Thompson accuse Irma of stealing Castafiore's emerald, she becomes angry and assaults them with a walking stick. In Tintin and the Picaros, she is arrested and put in jail along with Castafiore and Igor Wagner. She also appears in Tintin and Alph-Art as a background character and is the person who informs Castafiore of Tintin and Captain Haddock's arrival to Endaddine Akass's villa. =Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine= Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine lives in Brussels and is a collector of models of ships, among which, one is the Unicorn. He appears in The Secret of the Unicorn, in the old market. Noticing another model of the Unicorn, he and another man Barnaby try to buy it, only to find that it has already been claimed by Tintin. Tintin declines all the offers made by Barnaby and Sakharine to buy the model off him. Tintin's Unicorn is later stolen and he suspects Sakharine of the theft. Visiting Sakharine, he discovers the other Unicorn model. Sakharine is later attacked by Barnaby who steals the parchment from the model ship. It is one of three parchments that lead to a treasure. The Bird brothers are later arrested and claim that the parchments they obtained have since been stolen. Tintin thinks Mr. Sakharine stole the two parchments, but he soon discovers they were pickpocketed by Aristides Silk and recovers them. At the end of Red Rackham's Treasure, Mr. Sakharine can be seen attending the exhibition held at Marlinspike Hall, together with his landlady, showing off the various items recovered from the actual ship itself. He appears to have offered Captain Haddock his Unicorn model, which is shown in the display with the other two. In the unfinished Tintin adventure Tintin and Alph-Art, the surviving drafts of the story suggest that Haddock and Tintin notice Sakharine at a meeting hosted by mystic Endaddine Akass. In the film adaptation The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, Sakharine is reimagined as the main antagonist. The film portrays him as the descendant of the pirate Red Rackham, seeking vengeance on behalf of his ancestor against Sir Francis Haddock, who killed Rackham. Sakharine is portrayed by Daniel Craig (who also portrays Red Rackham) in the motion capture film. =Ben Kalish Ezab= Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab is the Emir of the fictional Arabian state of Khemed. His son is the spoiled prince Abdullah. After first appearing in Land of Black Gold, the Emir reappears in The Red Sea Sharks when he has been temporarily overthrown by his rival, Sheikh Bab El Ehr. Ben Kalish Ezab then appears in Tintin and Alph-Art, announcing during a television interview that he will build a museum of art in Wadesdah. Ben Kalish Ezab is depicted as kind and jovial to his friends and vicious and cruel to his enemies. On one occasion, Dr. M√ºller attempted suicide rather than be handed over to him. More than anything else, he dotes on his son Abdullah. Kalish Ezab is a wordplay; in Brussels dialect, kalisjensap means \\"liquorice juice\\". =Laszlo Carreidas= Laszlo Carreidas, a wealthy aircraft manufacturer tycoon, becomes embroiled in the adventure Flight 714 to Sydney. While Tintin and his friends are travelling in Indonesia on their way to Sydney, Captain Haddock mistakes Carreidas sitting in the Jakarta airport for a tramp. Meanwhile, the criminal mastermind Rastapopoulos kidnaps Carreidas to take his Swiss fortune. He is drugged by Dr. Krollspell to reveal his Swiss bank account number, rescued then bound by Tintin and Captain Haddock and marched as a hostage, and hypnotised by Mik Kanrokitoff to think that he still wears his hat. Kanrokitoff hypnotises him again and leaves him with the others in the motorboat, and later, Carreidas is on the flight to Sydney with Tintin and his friends. His unassuming figure notwithstanding, Carreidas is revealed to be a cunning individual with a long history of unscrupulous behaviour not limited to the business world; he is not above cheating Captain Haddock at a game of Battleships with the help of closed- circuit television. An aircraft industrialist, Laszlo Carreidas naturally travels in a prototype supersonic business jet, the Carreidas 160. Despite the caution he appears to take with his money, refusing to pay any ransom and keeping his accounts secret, Carreidas generally appears to have a random attitude about his finances, ordering the purchase of multiple paintings simply because a rival (\\"Onassis\\") is after them, and appearing more concerned about the loss of a rare hat (\\"a pre-war Bross & Clackwell\\") than the loss of his prototype aeroplane. Carreidas' name is a pun: carr√© d'as means \\"four aces\\" in French. Accordingly, the logo on the tail of his business jet consists of four aces. Herg√© based Carreidas on Marcel Dassault, the French aircraft industrialist, who possessed a similar combination of wealth, aeronautical engineering genius, and quaint notions of fashion (Dassault's wardrobe remained frozen in the mid-1930s). Carreidas is depicted in some sketches of the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art, in which he is seen at the inauguration of Ram√≥ Nash's art exposition. =Maharaja of Gaipajama= The Maharaja of Gaipajama is the monarch of a fictional princely state of India. He is kind and immediately trusting of Tintin, whom he meets in Cigars of the Pharaoh. The Maharaja explains that his family have long been fighting a criminal opium-smuggling gang. The Blue Lotus opens in the Maharaja's palace, where Tintin has been his guest. In reality, there is no place in India called Gaipajama; the name is a nonsensical mix of two Hindi words: Gai (cow) and pajama. The original French name is Rawajpoutalah. =Martine Vandezande= Martine Vandezande is the assistant of Henri Fourcart at his art gallery in Tintin and Alph-Art. She wears large glasses and is a follower of Endaddine Akass. Due to a listening device hidden in her necklace, she is made an unwitting informer of Akass and his henchmen. =Mik Kanrokitoff= () Mik Kanrokitoff is a Russian writer for the magazine Space Week. His name is Ezdanitoff in the original version, another example of Herg√©'s Bruxellois wordplay; is dat niet tof in Dutch means \\"isn't that nice\\". His fortuitous appearance in Flight 714 to Sydney helps Tintin, Captain Haddock, and their friends escape from an Indonesian island after Rastapopoulos and his cohorts set off an explosive charge, stirring up the island's volcano. Kanrokitoff wears a small antenna and transmitter that enables him to communicate telepathically with other people and even subject them to mass-hypnosis. He maintains close touch with an unseen race of extraterrestrials and it is their spaceship that enables Tintin and the others to escape the island. Although he was never seen by Tintin and his friends after this, Kanrokitoff is depicted in some sketches of the unfinished Tintin and Alph-Art, in which he is at the inauguration of Ram√≥ Nash's art exposition, apparently recognizing Tintin. =King Muskar XII= King Muskar XII is the monarch of Syldavia. He appears in King Ottokar's Sceptre. A keen motorist who drives his own car and keeps his own gun for protection, he is married to an unnamed queen consort. Because the Crown's sceptre once saved the life of King Ottokar IV in 1360, every year on Saint Vladimir's Day, 15 July, the current king must show the people that he has the sceptre; otherwise he will be forced to abdicate. Tintin discovered a plot to steal the sceptre and set out to warn King Muskar XII, though traitorous elements in the king's entourage, led by his aide-de-camp Boris (Colonel Jorgen), were ready to stop him. Upon hearing of the plot, the monarch was fair-minded enough to investigate Tintin's claims, which turned out to be true: the sceptre had been stolen, a constitutional crisis was imminent, and Syldavia was about to be plunged into an invasion by its long- term enemy Borduria. Muskar then orders his ministers and generals to prevent the invasion. The revolutionary party in the adventure, called the Iron Guard, may have been inspired by the Fascist paramilitary groups widespread in Europe between the wars. The abdication crisis was very similar to that of the Anschluss in Austria in 1938, though the conclusion was not the same. King Muskar XII and his country do not appear to have been based on definitive models; both were inspired by various Eastern European and Balkan states. Many of these states were monarchies ruled by Carol II of Romania, Zog I of Albania, Alexander I of Yugoslavia, and Boris III of Bulgaria. The king's costumes may have been inspired by the portrait of Spanish King Alfonso XIII and the Romanian prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza. The king bears a striking resemblance to Zog of Albania, a man who also carried a gun and confronted violent conspiracies. He is sometimes shown wearing a military uniform, holding the rank of Colonel of the Royal Guards. The king's military service is similar to members of other real European royal families, who have members that have served in their nation's militaries. King Muskar XII is noticeably absent from the post-war stories set in Syldavia: he does not appear at the launching of the moon rocket in Destination Moon and Tintin does not call on him for help when his friend Professor Calculus is kidnapped by Bordurian and later Syldavian agents in The Calculus Affair. The post-war Syldavia may no longer be a monarchy; the latter Adventures set after World War II came at a time when various Balkan models for the fictional Syldavia had now been overthrown and their rulers exiled. =Oliveira da Figueira= Senhor Oliveira da Figueira (or Oliveira de Figueira) is the friendly Portuguese salesman who can sell even the most trivial of items. He and Tintin first meet in Cigars of the Pharaoh. Tintin and Snowy have been cast adrift in the Red Sea when they are picked up by a dhow; Figueira is a passenger. He quickly talks Tintin into buying a variety of superfluous objects. He later appears in Land of Black Gold, where he plays a valuable role in helping Tintin infiltrate Dr. M√ºller's headquarters, taking Tintin there disguised as his nephew while keeping the guards distracted with an elaborate story. In The Red Sea Sharks, he hides Tintin and Captain Haddock in his house so they can speak to the Emir. He gets a brief mention in The Castafiore Emerald, when he sends good wishes to Captain Haddock following news claiming that he and Bianca Castafiore are engaged. Oliveira de Figueira is the form used by Herg√© in the later appearances of this character. He is named Oliveira da Figueira (lit. \\"Olive- tree of the Fig-tree\\") in his initial appearances. For The Red Sea Sharks Herg√© changed his name to Oliveira de Figueira. (Both spellings are correct in Portuguese: \\"de\\" means \\"of\\", while \\"da\\" means \\"of the\\".) =Dr. Patella= () Dr. Patella is a ginger bearded osteopathic doctor who appears briefly in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. His model skeleton is arrested by Thomson and Thompson, and later he attends to an unconscious Captain Haddock after his arrival back on Earth. He also sent a congratulatory telegram to Haddock when (incorrect) news of his engagement to Bianca Castafiore was announced in The Castafiore Emerald. In 2000, on one episode of the French- language version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, 73 percent of the voting audience correctly identified Dr. Patella () as the doctor who treated Captain Haddock in Explorers on the Moon. This led to allegations that the show was rigged: one Tintin fan questioned how such a large portion of the audience could pick from four options the correct answer, especially given Dr. Patella's very minor role in the series. A psychoanalyst postulated that children remember proper names much better than adults, hence its retention by members of the audience who read Tintin in their youth. The name Patella (and Rotule) has a medical origin. It means \\"kneecap\\". =Patrash Pasha= Sheikh Patrash Pasha is an Arab sheikh appearing in Cigars of the Pharaoh and a big fan of The Adventures of Tintin. He arranges for Tintin to be kidnapped, but when Tintin is brought before him, he recognises him from his adventures, frees him, and sends him on his way with fresh supplies. His servant shows Tintin an Adventures of Tintin book that Pasha owns. The book title shown to Tintin has changed over the years; it was originally Tintin in America, it became Tintin in the Congo at one point, and eventually settled on Destination Moon‚Äîthe most recently published title at the time but, confusingly, takes place after the events in Cigars of the Pharaoh. In The Red Sea Sharks, when Emir Ben Kalish Ezab was overthrown by Bab El Ehr, the Emir temporarily took refuge with Patrash Pasha's tribesmen, who remained loyal. =Professor Philippulus= Professor Philippulus, or Philippulus the prophet as he calls himself, is an astronomer who appears in The Shooting Star. After observing a ball of fire making its way towards Earth, Philippulus goes insane, dresses himself in white sheets, and goes around town beating a gong while claiming to be a prophet tasked with announcing the end of the world. The madman also decides that Tintin is a spawn of the Devil, and takes to harassing him at his home. Philippulus later escapes a mental asylum and makes it to the expedition ship Aurora, eventually taking refuge up the main mast and nearly setting off a stick of dynamite in the belief that it is a firework. Tintin tricks him into climbing down by using a megaphone to shout supposedly heavenly instructions for him; Philippulus relents and is taken back to the asylum. Philippulus represents the dilemmas some face over religious belief and scientific research. In his case, the conflict took a toll on his mind when the end of the world appeared to be imminent. =Professor Phostle= () Professor Decimus Phostle is an astronomer, observatory director, and expedition leader in The Shooting Star. Tintin consults him about a large bright star he saw in Ursa Major. Professor Phostle claims that it is a ball of fire that will hit the Earth and cause the end of the world the following morning, and actually looks forward to this, thinking that predicting the end of mankind would make him famous. Initially disappointed that the meteor has missed the Earth, Phostle consoles himself by naming an unknown metal fallen from the meteor after himself: \\"phostlite\\". He then leads an expedition of scientists to follow Tintin and Captain Haddock to attempt to retrieve the fallen phostlite from the sea. Phostle was to return in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon as a villain, but that early draft by Bernard Heuvelmans was abandoned by Herg√©. =The Picaros= The Picaros are a band of guerillas in the country of San Theodoros, supposedly under the control of General Alcazar in Tintin and the Picaros. Alcazar has returned to his country and is attempting to command the Picaros to mount a guerrilla operation over of his arch-rival General Tapioca. However, the Picaros have become corrupt drunkards since Tapioca started dropping copious quantities of alcohol near their camp. Tintin offers to cure the Picaros of their alcoholism if Alcazar agrees to refrain from killing Tapioca and his men. Alcazar reluctantly agrees. Moments after the Picaros are cured, a musical troupe called the Jolly Follies arrives, intending to perform at the upcoming carnival in San Theodoros. Alcazar, with a little advice from Tintin, launches an assault on Tapioca's palace during the carnival by dressing the Picaros in the troupe's costumes and sneaking them into the capital. =Piotr Skut= () Piotr Skut, an eyepatch-wearing Estonian pilot, appears in two albums: The Red Sea Sharks and Flight 714 to Sydney. In The Red Sea Sharks, Skut flies one of the DeHavilland Mosquitoes used by Sheikh Bab El Ehr to seize power in Khemed, and his squad strafes the boat Tintin and Haddock are using to cross the Red Sea. Tintin shoots down Skut's plane with an assault rifle in self-defence, but later rescues Skut from the waters onto a hastily assembled life raft. Grateful for his rescue, Skut becomes a faithful friend and later refuses to betray Tintin and Haddock, instead sharing the rest of the adventure with them. He repairs the sabotaged radio of the S.S. Ramona and steers the Ramona to outmaneuver torpedoes while Tintin calls for help, which arrives just in time to save the boat from a submarine's attack. In Flight 714 to Sydney, Skut has become a supersonic business jet pilot of the Carreidas 160, the prototype jet for millionaire Laszlo Carreidas. The aircraft is then hijacked by his own crew, who were under the pay of criminal mastermind Rastapopoulos. Skut aids Tintin and Haddock in rescuing the other captured passengers and, after an adventure involving extraterrestrials, returns with them to civilisation. Neither Piotr, Skut, nor Szut (in the original French) are plausible Estonian names. Piotr is Polish for Peter while the correct Estonian version would be Peeter. The name Skut was rather an excuse for a gag, as Captain Haddock believes he is telling him to \\"scoot\\" rather than introducing himself. In the original French, the Captain mistakes the name \\"Szut\\" for \\"zut\\", the French exclamation of frustration. In other international versions, his last name is changed to entail a rudely dismissive or slightly offensive term befitting the language in question. The Skut character is based on , an Estonian pilot who escaped to Sweden from Estonia in an Arado floatplane. =Prince of the Sun= The Prince of the Sun is the reigning monarch over a lost, sun-worshipping Incan civilisation in Prisoners of the Sun. When Tintin's party invades his temple, the Prince plans to burn them at the stake, but change his mind when a solar eclipse occurs just before the sacrifice. Convinced that the Sun God favours Tintin, the Prince releases him and provides him with generous gifts of gold and jewels. In return, Tintin and his friends promise never to reveal the location of the Temple of the Sun. =Ram√≥ Nash= Ram√≥ Nash is an artist and the creator of Alph-Art that Captain Haddock purchases at Fourcart Gallery in Tintin and Alph-Art. Tintin learns that Nash is under the control of Endaddine Akass to fabricate paintings of the masters in an art forgery ring. =Ridgewell= Ridgewell is a British explorer who travelled into the South American rainforest occupied by the Arumbayas. He first appears in The Broken Ear and appears later in Tintin and the Picaros. Ridgewell settled down with the Arumbayas and decided to stay, not caring if the outside world knew if he was dead or alive. When Tintin ventured into Arumbaya territory, Ridgewell initially fired darts at him in order to scare him away, but later agreed to take him to the Arumbaya village for information. Ridgewell did bring some of Western civilisation to the Native South Americans, such as introducing them to the game of golf. However, the players do not appear to have mastered it well‚Äîon one occasion hitting Tintin rather than the hole in the ground. Ridgewell's influence on the Arumbayas resulted in him gaining an enemy in the local witch doctor. When Ridgewell was captured by an enemy nation called the Rumbabas (Bibaros in the original version), the witch doctor kept this from the other Arumbayas, hoping to be rid of his rival. When one Arumbaya expressed concern for Ridgewell, the witch doctor threatened to turn him and his family into frogs. But Ridgewell got away and fired a dart into the witch doctor's bottom as punishment. Fortunately, unlike the Arumbayas, Ridgewell did not use poisoned darts. Ridgewell is also a ventriloquist and has a sense of humour, shown on occasions such as in Tintin and the Picaros when he fired a dart into the cigar of General Alcazar. In that adventure, he reestablished ties with Tintin, and was shown to lament changes in the behaviour of the Arumbayas, namely the spread of alcoholism. The character of Ridgewell is strongly reminiscent of the real-life British explorer Percy Fawcett who disappeared in the Amazon in 1925 under similar circumstances. =Sanders- Hardiman expedition members= () The Sanders-Hardiman expedition members brought the Incan mummy Rascar Capac back to Europe in The Seven Crystal Balls. The members of the expedition are: Professor Sanders-Hardiman (, head of the expedition), Professor Reedbuck (), Peter Clarkson (, expedition photographer), Mark Falconer (), Professor Paul Cantonneau (who also made an appearance in The Shooting Star), Dr. Midge (, director of the Darwin Museum), and Professor Hercules Tarragon (, who has the Rascar Capac mummy in his possession). They were hospitalized while cursed by the Incas as punishment for the theft of the mummy, put into comas and made to suffer nightmares. Tintin visited the Incas' hidden temple in order to save Professor Calculus, who had been kidnapped by them. He persuaded the Prince of the Sun to lift the curse, assuring the Incas that the expedition's purpose was not to steal from their people but simply to teach others about them. The Prince of the Sun releases his control over the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members and they awaken from their curse. =Sophocles Sarcophagus= () Sophocles Sarcophagus is an absent-minded professor and Egyptologist in search of the tomb of the Pharaoh Kih-Oskh, whom Tintin meets on a cruise ship at the beginning of Cigars of the Pharaoh. He is a bit of an eccentric: rowing a boat while unaware that it is not even in the water, saying goodbye to Snowy as if he was a little boy, and bumping into things and people. He is distracted, dresses Edwardian, and has an unusual beard. He is the first of a number of eccentric scholars that would culminate in the character Professor Calculus. Sophocles leads Tintin to the tomb hidden under the sand, but disappears soon after finding it. He, Tintin, and Snowy end up floating in sarcophagi in the middle of the Red Sea. Sophocles is then picked up by a ship captained by Allan, a drug smuggler, whose gang uses the tomb of Kih-Oskh as a base. With Sophocles as a prisoner, the ship sets off for India. When Cigars of the Pharaoh was first published in the 1930s, Sarcophagus was an unnamed and beardless scholar who wore sunglasses. When Tintin explored the tomb, he found sarcophagi for himself and Snowy but not for the scholar, who does not even turn up in the Red Sea incident‚Äîthus, how he ends up in India is unexplained. Tintin finds Sophocles in the Indian jungle completely by chance in a string of absurd coincidences, painting the symbol of Kih-Oskh on palm trees. Tintin even speculates that the scholar is a member of the gang of drug smugglers that he finds himself pitted against. Sophocles is now completely mad because he has been given poison called Rajaijah, imagining himself to be Pharaoh Ramesses II. He is eventually committed to a sanatorium in India for treatment. In The Blue Lotus, an antidote for Rajaijah was developed, but it was never revealed whether Sarcophagus was cured. =Studios Herg√© members= Herg√© and other Studios Herg√© members were not above drawing themselves and other characters into the action of some of the Adventures as cameo appearances. Herg√©, Edgar P. Jacobs, and Jacques Van Melkebeke appear in Tintin in the Congo (page 1, frame 1) as a man in a brown jacket, a dark-haired man in a grey suit, and a fair-haired man with glasses; in the same panel, also making a cameo appearance, are Thomson and Thompson.

Herg√© and Jacobs appear in King Ottokar's Sceptre (page 38, last frame) as men to the left in red and green dress uniforms, and later in the same book, Herg√©, his wife Germaine, Jacobs, and Van Melkebeke appear (page 59, last frame) as a man on the right in a green uniform accompanying a woman in mauve, a monocled man on the right with black hair and breastplate, and a fair-haired man in evening wear on the left near the window.

Jacobs and Jacques Van Melkebeke appear in The Seven Crystal Balls, the first (page 16, frame 4) as a man in brown suit and black bow-tie in the middle box on the left, and the other (page 57, frame 2) as a man standing behind General Alcazar. Studios Herg√© member Bob de Moor does not appear. Other cameos in the Adventures include Auguste Piccard, whom the character Professor Calculus is based on (appearing in The Shooting Star, page 21, frame 2, as the scientist on the far right) and Quick & Flupke, characters in a separate Herg√© series (appearing in Tintin in the Congo, page 1, frame 1, as two boys in the group, and also appearing in The Shooting Star, page 20, frame 8, as two boys running ahead of Thomson and Thompson, who are also making a cameo appearance in that book). =Professor Tarragon= () Professor Hercules Tarragon hosts a mysterious evening for Tintin and his friends in The Seven Crystal Balls. He was one of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members and displays the mummy of Rascar Capac in his home. He had previously been a classmate of Professor Calculus and this connection enables Calculus, Tintin and Captain Haddock to visit him at home one evening while he is under heavy guard during a summer rainstorm. Professor Tarragon is a large, strong, and ebullient character, whom Calculus formally called \\"Hercules\\". Tarragon seems fearless until a fireball bursts through his chimney and vaporises the mummy; he then becomes very shaken and fears that an ancient prophecy is coming true. That same night, he is the last to be attacked by means of the crystal balls. =Tharkey= Tharkey is a Sherpa guide who helps Tintin locate the ill-fated Patna-Kathmandu flight carrying Chang Chong-Chen in Tintin in Tibet. Although reluctant to risk the perilous attempt to find Chang, whom he believes to be dead, Tharkey leads Tintin and Captain Haddock to the crash site of the aircraft. After initially leaving the site to return to his village, he feels guilty for leaving them alone and returns just in time to help Tintin and Haddock out of a dangerous situation. However, he subsequently breaks his arm from an avalanche and must return to the plains after partly convalescing at a Buddhist monastery while Tintin and the Captain continue their search for Chang. Tharkey was based on Ang Tharkay, a Nepalese mountain climber and explorer who acted as sherpa and later sirdar for many Himalayan expeditions. He was \\"beyond question the outstanding sherpa of his era\\" and he introduced Tenzing Norgay to the world of mountaineering. =Wang Chen-Yee= Wang Chen-Yee is the Chinese leader of the Sons of the Dragon brotherhood featured in The Blue Lotus. He serves as Tintin's host during his stay in China, and later adopts Chang Chong-Chen. =Zorrino= Zorrino is an indigenous Peruvian boy who makes a living by selling oranges in the mountain town of Jauja. In Prisoners of the Sun, he leads Tintin and Captain Haddock on the trail of their kidnapped friend Professor Calculus to the Incan civilisation in the mountains. At the end of the adventure, Zorrino is invited to stay in the Inca city and follow their way of life, an invitation which he accepts.

History The project to create a new facility at Batilly, Meurthe-et-Moselle, was begun by Renault's subsidiary Saviem in 1972. It was continued when Saviem was merged with Berliet to form Renault V√©hicules Industriels (RVI). The factory was constructed between 1976 and 1979. In 1980 Renault took from its subsidiary RVI a 25% stake of the factory's capital to form SOVAB. At the same year the factory started to manufacture the first-generation Master. The first- generation Trafic was introduced in 1981 and the Renault B in 1982. During the following years Renault collaborated with General Motors and in 1997, they launched the Master II which was also marketed as Opel Movano. From 1995 onwards the Batilly factory became the sole assembler of the Trafic I, after the Chausson's Creil factory was closed down. The model was discontinued in 2000. Renault kept Batilly when sold RVI to Volvo in 2001. In 2010 was introduced the Master III. Facilities The SOVAB complex comprises 101 hectares of which 181,838 m2 are covered. There is a single production line. The vehicles assembled by the company are sold by Renault, Opel, Vauxhall, Nissan and Renault Trucks. On 13 June 2013, SoVAB produced its 2,000,000th unit.

WAIR allows birds to run up steep or vertical inclines by flapping their wings, scaling greater inclines than possible through running alone. The WAIR origin-of-flight hypothesis proposes that the nascent wings of theropod dinosaurs were used to propel the animal up slopes, such as cliffs or trees, in a similar manner to that employed by modern birds, and that powered flight eventually evolved from this usage. During its proposal, it was suggested that WAIR might have plausibly been used by feathered theropods like Caudipteryx to develop aerial flight. WAIR in living birds An adult chukar running on a horizontal plane Wing-assisted incline running has been studied extensively in chicks of the chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), and has been observed in juveniles and adults of other species of Galliformes as well as the rock dove (Columba livia). In chukar chicks, WAIR was experimentally demonstrated by comparing maximum inclines ascended by normal chicks to those with wing feathers trimmed or plucked entirely. On both smooth and rough surfaces, normal chicks were able to run up much steeper slopes than the other two groups, reaching maximum angles of 105¬∞ from the horizontal. Chicks used running alone at slopes up to 45¬∞, then employed wing-flapping at greater slopes, and maximum slope successfully scaled increased with age. When baby chukars hatch, they have not yet developed their flight feathers. As the babies develop, it takes approximately one week for feathers to appear, and about three weeks for the ability to fly. As the baby chukars grow and before flying for the first time, they use WAIR as a transition to adult flight. WAIR has also been studied in the Australian brushturkey (Alectura lathami), although maximum slope decreased with age, such that hatchlings could scale greater slopes (up to 110¬∞) than adults (up to 70¬∞). In rock doves, adults employ WAIR at angles greater than 65¬∞. =Explanation of using WAIR over normal flight= These galliformes might use WAIR instead of normal flight to reach tree branches because WAIR uses less energy than normal flight. Fewer muscles are used in the process of WAIR than normal flight, specifically pectoral and shoulder muscles which contribute to wing flapping. This provides an additional explanation as to why birds continue to use WAIR: it is faster than normal flight take-off, and running requires less energy than does flying. Therefore; the hindlimbs, in conjunction with the wings, may produce quick bouts of energy which may allow the bird to catch prey. This strategy also allows energy to be stored for use in a fight-or-flight situation such as to escape becoming eaten or caught. WAIR imposes less aerodynamic and physical forces than normal avian flight on the bird, an advantageous trait which may increase fitness. WAIR could have been used for balance purposes. Many theories propose that the manifestation of WAIR in birds is for predatory escape purposes, in that they are able to run up extremely steep and past vertical slopes (such as the trunk of a tree) to escape from a ground-dwelling predator. Another reason for the manifestation of WAIR may be for dispersal or to find food or resources, but this idea is mostly proposed as a survival strategy. Whether it is to evade predation, catch prey, enhance reproductive success, or simply a variation imposed for dispersal, flight among avian creatures has evolved to be a highly successful trait. Origin of flight hypothesis The WAIR hypothesis for the origin of flight is a version of the \\"cursorial model\\" of the evolution of avian flight, in which birds' wings originated from forelimb modifications that provided downforce, enabling the proto-birds to run up extremely steep slopes such as the trunks of trees. The hypothesis was prompted by the observation of living young chukar chicks using WAIR, and proposes that dinosaur wings developed their aerodynamic functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, possibly to escape from predators. Originally, it was thought that birds need downforce to give their feet increased grip in this scenario. However, a study found lift generated from wings to be the primary factor for successfully accelerating, indicating the onset of flight ability was constrained by neuromuscular control or power rather than by the shape of the wing itself, and that partially developed wings not yet capable of flight could indeed provide useful lift during WAIR. Additionally, when both the power and work needed for WAIR were examined, it was identified that the need for pectoral muscles in flight increases with the angle being scaled. Thus, WAIR is a hypothesis providing a model for an evolutionary transition from terrestrial to aerial locomotion as birds skeletally adapted to meet the requirements to scale steeper and steeper inclines by flight. This might have allowed smaller, potentially juvenile maniraptorans to scale the sides of trees to escape predators that were too big to climb. WAIR may have been present in oviraptorosaurs and therizinosauroids, but as the adults, especially of therizinosauroids, would probably break the trees trying to climb, their hatchlings or chicks would have made it up easily. Because of this way to escape predation, early maniraptorans might have evolved their long arms, true feathers and fused wishbones. =Response= One possible problem with the WAIR origin of flight hypothesis was noticed by Philip Senter. He argued that early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce on which WAIR depends is generated by upstrokes, Senter argued that early birds were incapable of WAIR or flapping flight. Evidence has been proposed against the WAIR hypothesis, stating that it is too simplistic and does not take additional information into effect. There have been additional mechanisms suggested, such as climbing claws, that would have provided an advantage for the birds, but are absent in fossil records or extant birds. Other arguments against WAIR include a lack of fossil evidence and no additional intermediate or transition stages available for study which would provide supplementary evidence for WAIR.

Despite the similarities in name and appearance, the grape has no close genetic relationship with the Piedmont wine grapes Barbera or Barbera bianca or the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda and is, instead, more closely related to the Campanian varieties Casavecchia and Catalanesca and the Apulian grape Nero di Troia.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 88 Allen Lane 2012 In Campania, Barbera del Sannio is often used as a blending variety that adds color and aroma notes to the wine but it is also permitted to be made as a varietal wine in Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Sannio. History and relationship to other grapes Despite similarities in their name, Barbera del Sannio has no close genetic relationship to the Barbera grape (pictured) grown in Piedmont and elsewhere in the world. Ampelographers believe that the first documented account of Barbera del Sannio was in 1844 by Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini in his account of native plant life in southern Italy. Gasparrini used the old synonyms Lugliese and Lugliatica to describe the grape with Luglio being the Italian word for the month of July, a potential reference to the color change of veraison during the growing season when the hard white berries of the vine start to turn dark red. By 1875, the grape was known as Barbera, being described by ampelographer Giuseppe Froio as similar in appearance to the Piedmont variety. For most of the 20th century, Barbera del Sannio was thought to be a local clone of the Piedmontese Barbera which created confusion in the DOC wine laws and regulations for regions where the two grapes were grown. It wasn't until the early 21st century when DNA analysis showed that the two grape varieties were distinct and that Barbera del Sannio shared no close genetic relationship with any Piedmontese variety (even the similarly named Barbera bianca). Instead, Barbera del Sannio appears to be closely related to several southern Italian varieties such as Nero di Troia (also known as Uva di Troia and Summariello) grape of Apulia and the Campanian varieties of Casavecchia and Catalanesca. However, since Barbera del Sannio (or its close relations) do not appear to be closely related to older Campanian varieties, such as Aglianico, Piedirosso, Falanghina, Fiano, Greco and Coda di Volpe,J. Bastianich & D. Lynch Vino Italiano pgs 300-301 Crown Publishing 2005 ampelographers believe that the vine was a relatively recent introduction to Campania. Viticulture Barbera del Sannio is a very vigorous vine that can be prone to producing a large, leafy canopy if not kept in check by pruning and canopy management techniques. The vine produces berries with very thick skins, rich in phenolics and color compounds, that also gives the vine some resistance to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot. Wine regions The Sannio Hills runs through the center of the province of Benevento. Most plantings of Barbera del Sannio can be found in province of Benevento in Campania, particularly around the village of Castelvenere. The grape can be used as a minor blending component for several Campanian DOC wines but can also be produced as a varietal in the Sannio DOC which covers the Sannio Hills that run through the heart of Campanian in the Benevento province. Barbera del Sannio grapes destined for DOC red or ros√© production in Sannio must be harvested to a yield no greater than 12 tonnes/hectare. The generic DOC red and ros√© wines (non varietal) are made from a blend of at least 50% Sangiovese with Barbera del Sannio and other local red grape varieties, such as Piedirosso and Sciascinoso, permitted to fill in the remainder. For both varietal and blended wines, the finished alcohol level must be at least 11%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 199-200 Firefly Books 2004 Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Barbera del Sannio tends to produce medium-bodied wines that are deeply colored and highly aromatic. It is most often used a blending component but some producers in the Sannio DOC have been producing varietal style wines from the grape. Synonyms Over the years, Barbera del Sannio has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Barbetta, Lugliese and Lugliatica. However, the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) currently doesn't recognize any synonyms for Barbera del Sannio.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Barbera del Sannio Accessed: April 9th, 2014 References Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Barbera del Sannio"},{"id":"42447394","text":"Kuttanellur Heliport is a Government of Kerala owned heliport located in Kuttanellur, in Thrissur city of Kerala, India.

The documentary captures Gloria Merriex‚Äôs transformation into an educational innovator and shows her engaging her math, reading, and science students at the most effective levels through her innovations, which included hip-hop and dance routines.  Background  Gloria Jean Merriex grew up in Gainesville, Fla. on the east side of the city. She earned an education degree from the University of Florida, and would spend her entire career at Duval Elementary School. In 2008, she died of a diabetic stroke, one day after receiving a W.K. Kellogg Foundation grant to share her teaching breakthroughs on a national level. Dvir decided to make a film about the school after talking with Don Pemberton, director of UF‚Äôs Lastinger Center for Learning, who had previously sent professors and doctoral students to watch Merriex's teaching methods. While Dvir never personally met Merriex, he had over 150 hours of footage to use for his project. While Steve Whitney contributed as well as a co-producer, most of the funding for the film came from the Kellogg Foundation itself, with Dvir being permitted final cut on the project. \\"I never had even one conversation with Kellogg about the making of the film,\\" Dvir said. \\"I interviewed a Kellogg rep as part of the filming process, but he never asked me about what I was doing. He simply answered my questions. I‚Äôve never even screened the rough cut for Kellogg!\\" Dvir admitted that after working on the film, his own thinking had shifted: \\"[Discovering Gloria] made me feel quite differently about standardized testing.\\"  Synopsis  The film focuses on Merriex‚Äôs transformation by way of archival footage and interviews with her students, family, and colleagues. In one of those interviews, Prof. Elizabeth Bondy ‚Äì director of the University of Florida College of Education‚Äôs School of Teaching and Learning, who studied Merriex's methods ‚Äì described how and why Merriex broke vital new ground. \\"She didn't move to using music because she studied Howard Gardner's work about multiple intelligences,\\" Bondy says in the documentary. \\"She moved to using music and movement and the other strategies that she used because she studied her students.\\" Discovering Gloria shows how Merriex helped Duval Elementary leap from an F on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test in 2002 to an A the following year.  Reception  Nearly 500 people ‚Äì including many of Merriex's former students ‚Äì attended a screening of a rough cut version for it in September 2013 at her home community of East Gainesville. The post-screening panel discussion featured Bondy along with University of Texas Assistant Prof. Emily Bonner, Alachua County School Board Member Leanetta McNealy, and UF College of Education Associate Dean for Research Thomasenia Adams. In her book Unearthing Culturally Responsive Mathematics Teaching, Emily Bonner described the documentary as \\"compelling\\". In her op-ed in the St. Augustine Record, Pam Thor called Discovering Gloria a \\"fabulous documentary\\" and urged all teachers and policymakers to watch it. In her article in The Gainesville Sun about the documentary‚Äôs first screening, Aida Mallard wrote that Discovering Gloria brings Gloria Jean Merriex \\"to life\\".

Regenerative Sciences, LLC, 741 F.3d 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2014), was a decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit filed on February 4, 2014 concerning more than minimally manipulated cell therapies and whether they are considered part of medical practice or a drug, the latter subjecting it to regulation under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regenerative Sciences LLC marketed a therapy procedure called Regenexx-C for the treatment of arthritis and orthopedic injury that involved extraction and culture of mesenchymal stem cells from the same patient which were later reinjected. In 2008, The FDA notified Regenerative Sciences LLC that the procedure may not be in compliance with their regulation using an Untitled Letter, which began a series of suits and counter suits, leading to the 2014 decision upholding the FDA‚Äôs regulation of more than minimally manipulated stem cell therapies. Regenexx-C Procedure The Regenexx-C Procedure was developed by Regenerative Sciences LLC and offered as a treatment for arthritis and other orthopedic conditions. The procedure involves extracting mesenchymal stem cells from a sample of the patient's bone marrow or synovial fluid. These cells are then cultured in the patient's autologous platelet lysate, allowed to proliferate, and mixed with an antibiotic before being reinjected into the same patient at the site of orthopedic injury. This is quite different from the medical procedures the company now offers, which are all fully 21 CFR 1271.15(b) compliant. History In the late 1990s FDA proposed regulating more than minimally manipulated (MAS Cells) cells as drugs. Public hearings were held which led to significant opposition from industry, professional groups, and academia. For example, the American Red Cross submitted written testimony that it opposed the FDA's position that cells should be regulated as drugs, instead proposing they be regulated as medical devices. The American Society of Clinical Oncology stated in their written testimony, \\"ASCO objects in the strongest terms to FDA's proposed regulation of stem cell transplants. This misguided proposal is unnecessary, would jeopardize the proper treatment of cancer patients and impede the development of new therapies, would substantially increase the cost of stem cell transplants, and exceeds FDA's legal authority.\\" Northwestern University also opposed this new regulatory schema, as did other groups such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization, Reprogenesis, Osiris Therapeutics, and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. In 2005-6, Regenerative Sciences obtained multiple legal opinions that their planned use of autologous, cultured bone marrow in their own patients was the practice of medicine. In 2006, the FDA made a one word change in its 21 CFR 1271 regulations, changing the wording from \\"into another human\\" to \\"into a human\\", thereby extending its regulatory authority over autologous stem cell therapies. In 2007 Regenerative began offering the cultured stem cell service to patients. In July 2008, Regenerative received an Untitled letter from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Biological Evaluation and Research which stated the Regenexx-C Procedure may not in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act et seq. and the Public Health Service Act. et seq. Regenerative responded in writing and asked for an administrative hearing with the FDA on the issue, which was denied. In 2009, Regenerative sued FDA in Denver District Court over the issue of whether the FFDCA allowed the FDA to regulate a small medical practice like a drug manufacturer. FDA claimed in court documents that it had not yet taken \\"final agency action\\" on the matter. As a result, judge Wiley Daniels ruled that the case was not ripe for judicial review. In August 2010, The FDA filed for an injunction that would prohibit Regenerative Sciences from continuing to provide the Regenexx-C Procedure. Regenerative advanced a counterclaim holding that the Regenexx-C Procedure should not be subject to FDA regulation because, as a medical procedure, it is not a drug but part of the practice of medicine. Further, they argued that if it was found to fall within federal regulation, then it would still be found exempt of manufacturing and labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the counterclaim and upheld the injunction. Regenerative Sciences appealed. Controversy Several former FDA chiefs did not believe that it was in the best interest of patients and the FDA for the agency to regulate autologous cells as drugs. Notably, former FDA chief Andrew von Eschenbach opined that, \\"The FDA alleged that the cells the firm used had been manipulated to the point that they should be regulated as drugs. A resulting court injunction halting use of the technique has cast a pall over the future of regenerative medicine.\\" In addition, former FDA deputy chief Scott Gottlieb voiced a similar opinion that \\"A recent decision by a federal trial court gave the Food and Drug Administration the latitude that the agency has long sought to regulate our cells as drugs. It could put the brakes on one of the most promising areas of medical research.\\" Boston College legal scholar, Mary Anne Chirba, writing in the Journal of Health and Biomedical law, opined that while FDA would likely prevail in the Regenerative case, the agency needed to revisit its attempts to regulate autologous cells as prescription drugs. Finally, NYU law professor Richard Epstein produced a policy statement entitled, \\"The FDA‚Äôs Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation\\" where he opined that FDA should have no regulatory authority over medical procedures including those involving cells. One of the issues cited by FDA in court documents was that Regenerative had failed to seek approval for its biologic drug and that it was not manufactured according to pharmaceutical company cGMP guidelines. Regenerative had published two safety papers on the procedure. The first was a 227 patient experience and the second was based on 339 patients. In addition, Peeters, et al. had published an independent review of the Regenerative source data on safety and concluded that the procedure was safer than commonly used Hyaluronic Acid injections. Decision On February 4, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs injunction against Regenerative Sciences‚Äô use of the Regenexx-C Procedure and also dismissed the counterclaims. The court found that the stem cell mixture used in the procedure fell well within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act‚Äôs definition of a drug and, by extension, a biological product, thereby triggering federal regulations. The counterclaim holding that the procedure was not a drug but part of the practice of medicine was rejected by the court, who emphasized that the mixture itself was the subject of the case, and that it is still considered a drug and biological product even when used in the practice of medicine.USA v. Regenerative Sciences, LLC. No. 12-5254 p. 6-7 The court also found that the mixture used in Regenexx-C could not be exempted from manufacturing and labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as a compound drug because mesenchymal stem cells have not been FDA-approved as components for use in compound drugs.USA v. Regenerative Sciences, LLC. No. 12-5254 p. 13-14 Having rejected the counterclaims and establishing that the Regenexx-C mixture is both a drug and subject to FDA regulation, the court then found that these regulations had been violated, and upheld the injunction. Impact It remains to be seen what the long term impacts of this ruling will be. However, there is worry that this case will reinforce the FDA‚Äôs ability to regulate cell therapies in the future, discouraging clinics and other companies interested in working with more than minimally manipulated stem cells from operating in the United States.

Mills joined the BBC before World War II as a sound effects operator, and served in the Free French Navy, on secondment from Royal Navy, during hostilities where he undertook revue-type shows. In 1947, he returned to the BBC, as a light entertainment producer. Yvonne Littlewood, then his personal assistant, recalled one live production of the three act Vivian Ellis musical Jill Darling in February 1949 which used both studios at Alexandra Palace, the set being changed in one while the second act was being broadcast. Mills served as the BBC's Head of Comedy for a period of five years from 1967-1972. While Head of Comedy at the BBC in 1968, it was Mills - according to creator Jimmy Perry - who suggested that a forthcoming series should be titled Dad's Army instead of The Fighting Tigers, and that John Le Mesurier should play the Sergeant and Clive Dunn, Corporal Jones. It was Mills who thought Frankie Howerd's role in the British stage production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum could be the basis for a series. This became Up Pompeii! (1969‚Äì70). He was also responsible for commissioning the sitcom The Liver Birds in 1969. While the first series of Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969) was still being transmitted, he wrote to John Cleese: \\"The shows seem to be getting better and better and this a view shared by most people who see it.\\" Offering him a role in the second series, he had been told by Barry Took that Cleese was unsure about continuing: \\"I do hope you will be able to take part both as a writer and performer because the show would lose a great deal if you are not one of them.\\" Last years Mills was the original producer of television series Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em (1973-1975), and briefly supervised Wodehouse Playhouse (1976). Mills joined Thames Television around this time, where he remained for the rest of his career. At Thames, he was responsible for the production of such series as Get Some In! (1975-1978) and Chance in a Million (1984-1986). Personal life From 1974, Mills was married to the actress Valerie Leon.

He was a keen amateur painter, largely of landscapes. His most important work was probably the restoration of Castle Toward. Life He was born in Haslar in Hampshire. He was the son of Margaret Hepburn and Sir David Deas, a naval surgeon. His grandfather was Francis Deas, provost of Falkland in Fife.Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Deas When his father died in 1876 his father‚Äôs brother, Sir George Deas took over the role of organising his education and sent him to Charterhouse School then to the University of Edinburgh. From that point onward he remained in Scotland. In 1890 he was articled to Robert Rowand Anderson and also began attending the new Edinburgh College of Art under Prof Frank Worthington Simon where he studied for three years. From 1896-97 he made a study trip undertaking many measured drawings. This was partly in the companionship of Robert Lorimer (who was a lifelong friend), who apparently swayed him from his original intention of being an interior designer to instead be an architect. He returned to Edinburgh late in 1897 and set up an office at 63 Frederick Street which he shared with Victor Daniel Horsburgh (but not as partners). In 1902 he set up in a grander office at 15 Rutland Square, leased from Robert Rowand Anderson (now the headquarters of the RIAS). Deas never married, and may be safely assumed to have been homosexual. In 1908 he built an impressive home in Aberdour which he called The Murrel. This has a strong Arts and Crafts flavour and its garden is allegedly laid out by Gertrude Jekyll. He invested in property in both Austria and Turkey and losing them both as a result of World War I. Due to the financial pressures he sold The Murrel in 1915. Thereafter he resided at a villa at Greenhill Gardens in Edinburgh. His finances improved with a major commission in 1921 to extend and restore Castle Toward which provided six years of work. At the conclusion of this work he went into semi-retirement and worked with Christopher Hussey on studying the work of Robert Lorimer. This culminated, in part, in a paper published in the RIBA Journal in February 1931 on the life and work of Lorimer. He retired completely in 1937. He died in 1951 and left his collection of art and Chinese pottery to the Royal Scottish Museum. He is buried with his father in Warriston Cemetery near the sealed east gate.

He appeared in vaudeville, burlesque, film, radio, and television. Cameron was best known for his vaudeville performances, first as part of the Kammerer & Howland musical comedy act, and later as a principal comedian on the Keith-Albee circuit. He appeared in several motion pictures and could be heard on WPRO (AM) radio as the ‚ÄúSinging Salesman.‚Äù Early life and career Early publicity photograph taken by Smales Studio in Providence, RI. Circa 1910. Kammerer was born as Jacques Kammerer on November 2, 1883, in Troyes, France. In 1897, he emigrated to Providence, Rhode Island with his father, Joseph Kammerer, and grandmother, Victorine Kammerer. As a teenager, Kammerer worked in a hat factory and trained as a gymnast at the Providence Boys‚Äô Club. He began performing as an acrobat at Rocky Point Amusement Park‚Äôs Forest Casino in 1903. He appeared in local minstrel shows and with The Newman Comedy Four. In 1904, Kammerer married Clara Montgomery Higgs. They had three children and divorced in 1911. After the divorce, the children lived with Kammerer‚Äôs grandmother, Victorine, and uncle on a dairy farm in Rehoboth, MA. Kammerer & Howland Kammerer entered Providence vaudeville as a performer of illustrated songs. In 1910, Kammerer and Edna Howland, a classically trained pianist, began appearing together at the Bijou theatre as ‚ÄúKammerer & Howland -- Classical Comedy Singing and Talking Act‚Äù. The Bijou was specifically designed as a venue for illustrated songs, which were performed between films, and an act like Kammerer & Howland would offer an upward of nine song programs per day at six days per week. The duo joined Fred Homan's Musical Stock Company at the Scenic Temple on Matthewson Street in 1911. Homan's company also included Eddie Dowling. Though it disbanded after only two years, the company was remembered fondly by Rhode Island theatregoers. Kammerer & Howland appeared on Marcus Loew‚Äôs national circuit for the first time in 1913. They toured North America on the Loew‚Äôs circuit for four years, and were known for comedic songs, clever banter, acrobatic dancing, and for Kammerer‚Äôs impersonations of Ford Sterling, Charlie Chaplin, and Bert Williams. Kammerer & Howland were billed alongside celebrated entertainers, such as Will Rogers and Marie Stoddard. In 1914, Kammerer joined the White Rats of America, a labor union organized by theatre employees in an effort to destabilize the Vaudeville Managers Association. Toward the end of the decade, Kammerer & Howland appeared together in American burlesque. They married and had one child, Donald L. Kammerer, born in Missouri during Kammerer and Howland‚Äôs tour with the 1919-1920 season of Pat White‚Äôs Gaiety Girls. The cast included Joe Yule and Nell Carter, who welcomed their only child, Mickey Rooney, while on the same tour.1915 publicity photo signed: \\"From Kammerer & Howland, Who are going to the top.\\" The Gaiety Girls‚Äô tour was the last for the duo of Kammerer & Howland. Howland returned to Providence, RI, with their son shortly after his birth. In 1923, she sued Kammerer for divorce on grounds of neglect and extreme cruelty. Howland was awarded custody, as well as a provision of ten dollars per week. Jack Cameron In 1921, Kammerer adopted the stage name Jack Cameron. Around this time, he was offered a string of lead roles in New York City burlesques. He appeared in Sliding Billy Watson's World of Frolics, Eddie Dowling's Hello Miss Radio, and Fred Clark's Let‚Äôs Go. In 1923, Cameron was cast as a principal in Charles Waldron‚Äôs Bostonians. The show earned mixed reviews, but Cameron was a stand out. Alfred Nelson, theatre critic for Billboard, referred to Cameron as ‚Äúa singer, dancer, and versatile actor of remarkable ability.‚Äù Variety noted that the audience \\"couldn't get enough\\" of Cameron's baritone. Bostonians also marked the first artistic collaboration between Cameron and the youthful singer, Leo Lee. After Bostonians, Cameron was cast as the principal comedian in vaudeville producer Charles B. Maddock's Tramp, Tramp, Tramp: A Song of the Road, book by Ballard MacDonald. Tramp paired Cameron once again with Leo Lee, along with six supporting male performers. The men played singing hobos, thrown together by fate in a camp beside a railroad track. The show was a hit and toured nationally on the Keith-Albee Circuit between 1925 and 1927. Cameron followed Tramp, Tramp, Tramp with lead roles in three other C.B. Maddock productions: Sidekicks (1927-1929), Style Shop (1930), and All Wet (1931).Cameron in Tramp, Tramp, Tramp. 1925. In 1929, Cameron starred alongside Helen Morgan in the Rouben Mamoulian motion picture, Applause. Cameron's character was true to life: he played an aging burlesque clown by the name of ‚ÄúJoe King.‚Äù During the opening scenes of Applause, Cameron's comedic and acrobatic abilities are on full display, with shots of Cameron clowning-around and backflipping across the sound stage.

Heroes  ; / : : Sponsors: Apollon Media, S.H. Figuarts, SoftBank, FamilyMart, Lotte : One of the main protagonists and a veteran superhero past his prime whose total disregard for private property when fighting against crime earned him the nickname \\"Crusher for Justice\\". Originally, he was the least popular among the heroes of Stern Bild City and his company (a fictional publication known as \\"TopMag\\") had been taken over thanks to the high costs of his collateral damage. He was then forced by his new employers, \\"Apollon Media,\\" to become Barnaby's partner. His wife died from a disease five years prior to the series, and his daughter Kaede lives with his mother in \\"Oriental Town\\" out in the country. Like most people outside of Hero TV, Kaede is initially unaware of her father's secret identity. Kotetsu possesses the power to increase his physical abilities hundredfold for five minutes (known as the \\"Hundred Power\\"), requiring an hour-long cooldown period before using it again. Later on in the series his ability starts to change, at first becoming more potent at the cost of a shorter time limit, signified by red-orange eyes and an orange aura instead of the normal blue. Tiger's old employer Ben Jackson, working as a cab driver, finds out about Tiger's power boost and informs him that it is actually a precursor to his powers fading away for good, a rare condition among NEXT. The Hundred Power's potency then returns to its original strength, and its time limit grows shorter with each activation, lasting about three minutes and 45 seconds by the end of the series. Kotetsu keeps a journal to track his decreasing power, each entry showing a decrease of two to five seconds per use. After defeating Albert Maverick, Kotetsu retires from heroics, but returns a year later now calling himself \\"Wild Tiger 1 Minute\\" and working with the \\"Second League\\" heroes, vowing to continue being a hero even after his powers disappear for good. During Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, it is implied that Kotetsu's identity is now public to some degree, though he continues to wear a mask and insist on a secret identity due to his traditional beliefs. : His Apollon Media suit includes advertisements for Bandai's S.H. Figuarts toy line and telecommunications company SoftBank. The SoftBank logo on his shoulder in the series is replaced by a different ad in the films: FamilyMart in Tiger & Bunny: The Beginning and Lotte in Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. Tiger also possesses a motorcycle called the \\"Lonely Chaser\\", which is able to combine with Barnaby's own bike as a sidecar in a combination known as \\"Double Chaser.\\" Tiger's suit also includes a pair of wire guns known as the \\"Wild Shot\\". Having been inspired by a hero named Mr. Legend, who helped him to accept his powers, Kotetsu has traditional ideals of justice, always relying on his instincts, putting lives over ratings, and prioritizing hero work over publicity stunts. After helping Barnaby defeat Jake Martinez and finally earning his partner's trust, Kotetsu becomes far more popular and gains much more respect from the public, his employers, and his fellow heroes. In the first Drama CD for the series, it is revealed that Kotetsu and Antonio \\"Rock Bison\\" Lopez were punks in their high school days, and it was Kotetsu's class representative Tomoe (who later became his wife) who came up with the name \\"Wild Tiger\\". The next episode previews suggest that Kotetsu has a very poor grasp of the English language, as he often struggles to read out the next episode's title. ; / : : Sponsors: Apollon Media, Bandai, \\"Crusade System\\" Card Series, Amazon.com : The other protagonist, known as the \\"Super Rookie\\", who is nicknamed \\"Bunny\\" by Kotetsu because of his armor's earpieces and his penchant for long jumps and kicks. Barnaby is a 25-year-old rookie hero who does not conceal his appearance or identity and is the newest addition to Hero TV. Partnered with Wild Tiger, he has the same power, though Barnaby relies more on strategy than outright brute force, saving his Hundred Power for the most dire of circumstances. His powered suit displays advertising for Amazon.co.jp as well as Bandai and its \\"Crusade System\\" Card Series. He is also equipped with a motorcycle called the \\"Lonely Chaser\\" that is able to use Tiger's own bike as a sidecar, a combination known as \\"Double Chaser.\\" When he was four years old, his parents, robotics engineers and the inventors of \\"nano-metal\\", were assassinated by someone originally thought to be Jake Martinez of the crime syndicate \\"Ouroboros\\". Barnaby was taken in by Albert Maverick and dedicated his life to investigating Ouroboros and its connection with the death of his family. The trauma of seeing his parents murdered hardened Barnaby's heart and consumed him with thoughts of revenge, making it impossible for him to trust anyone until he began his partnership with Kotetsu. According to Barnaby, he took his real name, also his father's, as his hero name as a declaration of war against Ouroboros. After defeating Albert Maverick, Barnaby retires from heroics thinking his entire career was for nothing, but when Kotetsu returns as \\"Wild Tiger 1 Minute\\" a year later, Barnaby returns as well to assist his partner. :After defeating Jake Martinez and learning to trust Kotetsu as his partner, Barnaby adopts a positive outlook on life, becoming more open and willing to work with others. He starts addressing Kotetsu by name instead of as \\"Old Man\\", and accepts \\"Bunny\\" as his nickname. Though when his memory is altered by Maverick, Barnaby is snap out of the mental conditioning when he's called Bunny, showing he still hates the name to a degree. His successful partnership with Kotetsu soon leads Barnaby to rank first in Hero TV's rankings, earning him the \\"King of Heroes\\" title in his debut season. Barnaby eventually surpasses Mr. Legend's points-per-season record, and dreams of a \\"Hero World\\" envisioned by his surrogate father, Albert Maverick, where all NEXT are accepted and heroes protect the innocent. ; / : : Sponsors: Titan Industry, Pepsi & Pepsi NEX : Nicknamed the \\"Super Celebrity of the Heroes\\", Blue Rose is a highschooler with freezing powers who still lives with her parents and makes use of her heroic feats to boost her career as a singer.

Her revealing costume, which her father disapproves of, includes advertising for Pepsi NEX, a zero calorie Pepsi available in Japan developed by Suntory, a company who took part in the experiment which successfully produced the first true blue rose through genetic engineering, hence her alias and rose-themed uniform. The costume also makes Karina's bust look bigger than it actually is. She is also equipped with a monowheel-snowmobile vehicle, which she propels using her powers. Despite claiming to dislike Kotetsu, Karina develops feelings for him, which causes her much internal conflict considering the age difference. After the one year timeskip, Karina is seen reading a book about how to win a single dad's heart; seems she hasn't given up. At the insistence of her sponsor company and to her distaste, Blue Rose always tells criminals \\"my ice is a little bit cold, but your crime has been put completely on hold!\\" upon apprehending them. Karina has a habit of comically retreating from fights if they get too difficult for her, an act Hero TV's announcer dubs the \\"Cutie Escape\\".

His overly dramatic and optimistic personality is actually his main selling point, with his catchphrases being a cheerful to his fans and his own name when he launches an attack. He, by his own admission, struggles to make his feelings and intentions clear to others, hence why he often repeats himself and gestures dramatically, and does not understand why people find him funny. Sky High is able to fly with the assistance of a rocket backpack and has the power to control the wind and air currents. During Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, Sky High is once again the King of Heroes. His uniform includes advertising for Bandai's subsidiary Tamashii Nations and streaming website Ustream.tv. In the films, he also sports ads for Movix and T-Joy, Japanese movie theater chains.

Nathan struggled to come to terms with their sexuality and gender identity during their childhood, and is implied to have been disowned by their parents because of it. They eventually comes to accept themselves by saying that they, and by extension all people like them, possess both the courage of a man and the love of a woman, making them invincible. They are also the owner of their sponsor company, \\"Helios Energy,\\" and their costume displays advertising for FMV of Fujitsu and anime/manga retailer Animate.

Pao- Lin's parents did not go with her to Stern Bild City and stayed behind in China. They did, however, leave her a purple flower hairpin that she was originally against wearing, claiming it was \\"too girly\\", despite her caretaker's insistence. However, after learning the flower's symbolic meaning was \\"thinking of you always\\", she makes a habit of wearing the hairpin whenever she is in civilian attire. During Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, she develops the ability to briefly shape her lightning into various forms, such as a large Chinese dragon.

After ranking last in Hero TV's standings behind Origami Cyclone, he was in danger of losing his job as a hero before helping to catch a backstage thief. By the time of Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, Rock Bison is easily the least popular and effective hero in the First League. Throughout the film, he desperately tries to find a new gimmick to boost his popularity by mimicking another hero's catchphrase or behavior.

His suit in Tiger & Bunny: The Rising also features ads for Japanese gy≈´don restaurant chain Sukiya. His sponsor company is \\"Kronos Foods\\". : In the first drama CD for the series, it is revealed that Antonio and Kotetsu were both punks in their high school days. Antonio, then the leader of a different school's gang, had repeatedly challenged Kotetsu to fights because of his reputation, and was turned down until Tomoe, Kotetsu's class representative and future wife, was kidnapped. Kotetsu, believing Antonio to be the kidnapper, finally accepted the challenge and the two fought after discovering their opponent was a NEXT. After the fight, Antonio insisted he did not know of a kidnapping, and the nearby warehouse where Tomoe was being kept burst into flames. Kotetsu, not using his Hundred Power up to this point, activated his powers and saved Tomoe, inspiring Antonio to only use his powers to protect people from that day forward. ; / : : Sponsors: Helperidese Finance, .ANIME, Takasu Clinic, Livedoor, Namco & Namco Namja Town, MiniMini, DMM.com, ≈åedo Onsen Monogatari : The young \\"Hidden Hero\\", clad in a ninja/samurai-themed costume and known to act much like a kabuki performer. Ivan rarely takes action and engages himself more in advertising than in actual crime-fighting, appearing in the background of photos and broadcasts to please his sponsors. His shapeshifting ability allows him to copy the appearance and voice of other people, but not their abilities or powers, and change into various inanimate objects such as a poster on a wall. Ivan is initially a very reluctant hero, only acting as he does because of insecurities regarding his \\"useless\\" power and guilt over becoming a hero over his former friend, Edward. After helping Edward (who had broken out of jail to kill Ivan in jealousy) escape Lunatic's judgement, Ivan vows to become a more active hero and move out of the background, quickly rising out of last place in Hero TV's rankings for the first time. However, he still engages in the occasional \\"photobomb\\", with a running joke having him appear hidden somewhere in the background of a scene, even ones not broadcast on Hero TV. His sponsor company is \\"Helperidese Finance\\". In the epilogue of the series, it is revealed that Ivan regularly visits Edward in prison to tell him about his exploits as Origami Cyclone. : Origami Cyclone's involvement in the Ouroboros incident tremendously boosts his popularity and reputation as a true hero and not just a walking billboard. His costume contains advertising for anime goods website \\".ANIME\\" and eventually gains other sponsors: internet service provider Livedoor, Namco's NAM-Chara Cheer Squad, and Katsuya Takasu's beauty clinic, likely because of his newfound popularity. In the films Tiger & Bunny: The Beginning and Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, his suit also displays ads for Bandai Visual Club. To offset Origami's power being little use in combat, he has various weapons to assist him. The large shuriken on his back can be thrown and ridden, and he has an arsenal of normal sized shuriken. The swords on his back can also be used, and are able to project energy to use as a shield or distraction. By the time of Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, Origami has been training himself to be a more aggressive hero, making more use of his suit's various weapons. ; / : : Sponsors: Apollon Media, Banpresto, Tantia, Dartslive :A hero from overseas, nicknamed \\"Gravity Prince,\\" who appears in the movie, Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, serving as Kotetsu's replacement as Barnaby's partner. Ryan displays a boisterous, showboating personality, caring far more about being in the spotlight and earning points than saving lives, the complete opposite of Barnaby's former partner. He possesses the power to create a strong localized gravity field, immobilizing anyone within a certain radius. He is also shown he is able to alter the shape of the field by thinning the width to increase the length to subdue an enemy further away. However, using his powers makes him incredibly vulnerable to attack, as it requires him to remain stationary with his hands on the ground. He possesses a golden motorcycle with a lion motif (a play on his name in Japanese, as Ryan [„É©„Ç§„Ç¢„É≥] shares the same pronunciation as Lion [„É©„Ç§„Ç¢„É≥]), which is able to combine with Barnaby's Lonely Chaser. He eventually leaves Stern Bild after an overseas company offers him a larger salary than Apollon Media did. Ryan's catchphrase is \\"kiss my boots,\\" typically said whenever he uses his power to immobilize someone. He also has a habit of making a roaring noise whenever he uses his powers, though it is unknown if he has to do so, or if it is just part of his egotistical nature.

He can also use his flames to teleport, pass through solid objects, or encircle his target to prevent their escape. Lunatic is obsessed with his personal idea of justice and order based on an eye for an eye philosophy. He believes that criminals and wrongdoers should receive punishment equal to their sins, cleansing the world of evil through killing violent and unrepentant criminals. To that end, he questions the effectiveness of Hero TV's heroes, who simply capture criminals regardless of their crimes. Yuri adopted his idea of justice and hatred of heroes after killing his father, Mr. Legend, unintentionally with his power when he defended his mother from his father's beatings. The handprint design on Lunatic's mask is a reminder of the burn he got in the process, and he covers the disfiguring scars with heavy cosmetics when in public, giving his face a pale tone. Yuri cares for his senile mother, who usually believes Mr. Legend is still alive and Yuri is still a child, only to launch into a hateful rage directed towards Yuri when he insists otherwise. Lunatic's appearances are marked by a giant red moon hanging in the sky. Lunatic often tells his victims to \\"hear the voice of Thanatos\\" before killing them. ; : :A NEXT who leads a small sub-faction of the Ouroboros criminal organization, Jake is initially thought to be the man who killed Barnaby's parents. He was captured by Legend 15 years before the start of the series and was serving a 250-year-long sentence in prison, but in the present day his comrades stage a large scale terrorist attack, threatening to bring down Stern Bild City unless he is released. His main objective is to have NEXT take over the world with him as their leader, believing NEXT to be intrinsically superior to normal humans almost to the point of godhood. He appears to have some appreciation for art, since he is first seen using his powers to make a mural of a forest landscape on his cell wall; however, it also contains a hidden picture of a skull. :He has the ability to produce force fields of various sizes, which he can use both defensively and offensively. It is later discovered that he has a previously unheard of second power, telepathy. Jake's left leg was lost in an accident at some point in the past, and is replaced by a mechanical prosthetic by the present day. He is eventually defeated in his fight with Barnaby thanks to Tiger's help. While trying to escape via helicopter, he is restrained by Tiger. In retaliation, he fires off an offensive barrier, misses, and hits his own getaway helicopter, which falls on him and kills him, a fate Lunatic found appropriate and ironic. Unlike other NEXT, whose eyes and body glow blue when using their powers, Jake's aura and eyes shine orange. Later in the series, Kriem reveals that Jake had kidnapped her on the very day that Barnaby's parents were killed and was with her at the time that the murders took place. Despite Barnaby initially dismissing these claims, Kotetsu later reveals that Jake had no Ouroboros tattoo on the back of his right hand, a feature Barnaby recalled in his memories. The revelation that Jake was not the true murderer of the Brooks family sent Barnaby into a depressed, enraged stupor. ; : :Another NEXT member of Ouroboros whose ability is to control inanimate objects (typically dolls) with needles made from her hair. She is Jake Martinez's most loyal follower and is implied to have been romantically involved with him. During Tiger and Barnaby's confrontation with Ouroboros, Jake accidentally shoots down the escape helicopter she is piloting, causing her to fall out onto the stadium roof. After the conflict, she falls into a coma and is hospitalized, her head shaved to prevent her from using her powers should she awaken. Ten months later, Kriem comes out of her coma, only to reveal that Jake had kidnapped her on the day that Barnaby's parents were murdered, and therefore could not have been the murderer. :Kriem was harassed by people for being a NEXT throughout her childhood, which made her feel worthless and inferior to humans. When she was kidnapped by Jake, her parents, ashamed and afraid of their daughter, did not bring the ransom. Urging Jake to kill her and end her worthless life, Jake instead taught her that she was superior to humans and that they only ostracized her because they were afraid of her. From that day on, she joined Jake in the fight to create a world where only NEXT existed. Upon revealing her past, she rips out the IV lines in her body and starts convulsing, telling Barnaby that he would live the rest of his life in doubt as punishment for killing Jake before finally dying, happy that she'll be reunited with him in the afterlife. She also reveals in her final moments that Jake only controlled a small portion of Ouroboros, and the organization is far bigger than anyone could comprehend. ; : :A member of Jake's Ouroboros faction, serving under Kriem. He has no NEXT powers, but he is a firm believer in the organization's cause. The heroes kidnap him, so Origami Cyclone can take his place. However, Jake discovers the ruse; Hans thought he would be rescued, but Jake killed him instead as he lost all respect from him since he was easily captured. ; : : The President and CEO of Apollon Media, the company responsible for Hero TV and sponsor company for Wild Tiger and Barnaby. He was a good friend of the Brooks family and often took care of young Barnaby when his parents were working. After Barnaby's parents were killed, Maverick took him in and became his adoptive father. It is later revealed that Maverick is a NEXT with the power to alter memory, and is the true murderer of Barnaby's parents. Over the years, he intentionally shaped Barnaby's memories and life to cover his tracks and, seeing great potential in the boy, inspire him to become the perfect hero. In order to get Hero TV's ratings up from their initial slump thanks to public distrust of NEXT, Maverick had worked with Ouroboros to set up extravagant crimes for heroes like Mr. Legend to thwart. Maverick was forced to assassinate Barnaby's parents when Barnaby Sr. threatened to publicly reveal the whole operation because the family's \\"nano-metal\\" hero suit compound was being given to criminals. As Kotetsu and Barnaby get closer to discovering the truth, Maverick sets up an elaborate ploy to continue covering his tracks, framing Kotetsu for the murder of Barnaby's Aunt Samantha and wiping the heroes' and Hero TV employees' memories of Kotetsu, but not of Wild Tiger. He also commissions the creation of a new, more advanced black and red hero suit for Barnaby and several androids dressed in a similarly colored version of Tiger's suit. When confronted by all eight heroes, Maverick admits defeat and uses his powers on himself, wiping his memories completely and leaving him in a catatonic stupor. While being transported via police convoy to prison, Maverick is killed by Lunatic, who tells him that \\"no one can escape their sins.\\" ; : : A mad scientist who worked under Barnaby's parents and greatly despises NEXT, believing them to be monsters. He is a genius in robotics, having created a very powerful android by the name of Cis that was capable of overwhelming both Kotetsu and Barnaby with their powers active. He is later employed by Maverick to build a more powerful android, the \\"H-01\\", clad in a red and black version of Wild Tiger's armor and armed with a powerful laser rifle. H-01 was constructed to defeat the heroes and eventually replace them with more H-01 model androids, as Maverick believes them to be more useful for Hero TV since androids would not have personal lives and would not tire. Rotwang is a cold man who believes things such as human emotions and relationships to be nonsense, greatly favoring what his androids can do. Rotwang falls to his death from the top of the Apollon Media statue after Maverick claims he has outlived his usefulness. ; : :An internationally-wanted thief who appears in the movie, Tiger & Bunny: The Beginning. He is a NEXT who has the ability to instantly switch locations with anybody he can see. His outfit is fitted with an assortment of wheels and roller-blades in order to travel quickly on foot. In the movie, he steals a symbolic statue and uses his power to confuse the heroes. However, he is thwarted when Barnaby, having gotten an idea from Kotetsu, uses his suit as a decoy and traps Robin so he cannot see and switch places with anyone. ; : :A former professional boxer who appears in the movie Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, seeking revenge on Mark Schneider for ruining his boxing career. He is a NEXT with the ability to amplify his voice to create destructive waves of sound. He wears a special mask to control his abilities. ; : :A NEXT with the power to create duplicates of herself, appearing in the movie Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. Kasha seeks revenge against Mark Schneider for closing down the theater she once performed in as a dancer. She utilizes chakrams as her weapon of choice, using her NEXT ability to disorient opponents. Her duplicates disappear if struck, though are just as capable of attacking as the real Kasha. ; : :An elderly NEXT who appears in the movie Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. Johnny seeks revenge against Mark Schneider for destroying the temple at which he once served as a monk. Johnny has the ability to induce a deep sleep in anyone who comes into contact with him. While asleep, the victim will be trapped in a nightmare of their worst fears until they either overcome the fear or Johnny is defeated. Johnny also possesses enhanced healing abilities from a cellular regeneration belt he wears and is an accomplished martial artist armed with a three-section staff. ; / : :Mark Schneider's aide, appearing in the film Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. As Virgil Dingfelder, he is a calm, quiet, reserved man who loyally works under Schneider. His real name is later revealed to be Andrew Scott, the son of a single father who founded a small technology firm. Andrew's father entered a business deal with Schneider and was later bought out. This left the Scott family with nothing and eventually led to Andrew's father's suicide. Andrew blamed Schneider for his father's death and concocted a plan to take on a new identity and get close to Schneider and get revenge. To that end, he enlisted the help of Richard Max, Kasha Graham, and Johnny Wong, who all similarly wanted revenge on Schneider for their own reasons. Andrew is also revealed to be a NEXT himself, with the power of technopathy, giving him the ability to control and shape technology in various ways. Supporting characters ; : : Tiger's old employer at the start of the series, the hero division director of TopMag. Because of the ever-rising repair costs of Tiger's antics, TopMag goes bankrupt and is bought out, causing Jackson to lose his job. He becomes a cab driver for Poseidon Line later on in the series and remains a good friend of Kotetsu, having total faith in him as a hero. He later appears to Kotetsu when his powers get a boost, telling him that is a sign that they will eventually fade and that his idol, Mr. Legend, faced the same problem. Jackson appears once more to provide support to Tiger when he is framed for murder by Maverick. He provides Kotetsu with his old TopMag Wild Tiger costume, declaring he was always a big fan and that he will always support Wild Tiger. One year after the events of the series, Jackson becomes a high-level employee at Apollon Media. ; : : The producer for Hero TV, having been recently promoted before the first episode; Mr. Maverick would later admit he was wrong to have doubted the decision to promote her, since she does an amazing job. Her top priority is to increase the show's ratings and please her boss and the sponsors, regardless of the impact on the heroes' work. She always greets the heroes with the phrase, \\"Bonjour, Heroes\\" (\\"Hello, Heroes in the English dub.) ; : : Albert's subordinate at Apollon Media, responsible for managing Kotetsu and Barnaby's career. At first, he quiets any protests made by Kotetsu by presenting resignation as an alternative, but after Kotetsu and Barnaby's fame increases thanks to defeating Jake Martinez, his attitude becomes much friendlier. ; : : An engineer working for Apollon Media in charge of developing equipment for the company's superheroes. He normally speaks respectfully in a barely audible voice, but shouts loudly and brazenly over radios and intercoms. He also has a penchant for adding new upgrades to the heroes' suits that have very little usefulness in the field, such as a complicated clock on the left arm of Tiger's suit for checking the time, and \\"Good Luck Mode\\". Good Luck Mode consists of flashy add-ons to Tiger and Barnaby's armor that create a giant fist and leg, respectively, when their power is close to running out. Good Luck Mode is initially thought to increase Tiger and Barnaby's strength, but Saito reveals that the parts and their special effects are just for show and it is actually the pair's excellent teamwork that helps them. Saito also develops a special sleep chamber for Barnaby that allows him to access his memories more clearly in his dreams by depriving him of outside stimuli. Saito displays an almost sadistic level of glee whenever tests must be done on Kotetsu or his suit, seemingly making them agonizing for Kotetsu on purpose. ; : : Kotetsu's ten-year-old daughter, who lives with her grandmother in Oriental Town since her mother died and her father became Wild Tiger and moved to Stern Bild. She is initially unaware of her father's life as a hero, and resents and distrusts him for always being tied up with \\"work\\" and not understanding her more mature needs and fears of being left alone. Ironically enough, she is a huge fan of Barnaby, her father's partner, since he saved her from falling debris early in his career. She keeps dozens of pictures of Barnaby in her desk drawer, usually cutting out Wild Tiger whenever he is present in them. Kotetsu's one dream in life is to make his daughter think he is \\"cool\\", and he tries his hardest to balance his roles as hero and father with varying degrees of success. Kaede eventually awakens as a NEXT, with the power to copy the abilities of any NEXT she touches, usually exhibiting little control over their activation. Kaede treats her new abilities with distaste, as they cause her and her family much stress. After learning of her father's true identity when he is framed for murder, Kaede travels to Stern Bild alone to prove her father's innocence, having a run-in with Albert Maverick upon reaching the Apollon Media building and inadvertently copying his power. When she finally meets up with her father, she tries to prove his innocence to the other heroes, and when the try to apprehend him she uses her absorbed memory-alteration power to give them their memories back, only missing Barnaby because Sky High claps her shoulder in congratulation (thereby overwriting the previous ability) immediately before he arrives. Kaede becomes a key player in the final conflict with Maverick, assisting the heroes in escaping Dr. Rotwang. : Kaede's prodding and complaints that Kotetsu has become an \\"uncool\\" couch potato are part of the reason he returns to being Wild Tiger one year after quitting. She finds it annoying that she can no longer watch her father's exploits as a Second League hero on Hero TV, as the show only covers the First League. Even after accepting and coming to terms with her father's life as a superhero, she still routinely refuses his attempts at fatherly affection, albeit in a playful manner. ; : :A powerful android created by Dr. Rotwang with the appearance of a young woman, whose databanks contain information about the active heroes. While being transported, the truck carrying her is struck by lightning and she escapes. Keith later finds her sitting on a park bench. Despite only being able to respond in a few basic phrases, Keith's conversations with Cis help to boost his confidence after losing the King of Heroes title to Barnaby, eventually leading to him falling in love with her. Cis is programmed with an automatic attack system whenever heroes are seen or mentioned, leading her to attack and almost overwhelm Kotetsu and Barnaby, losing her outer skin in the ensuing fight. Keith as Sky High soon arrives and destroys the android. After the battle, Keith returns to the now empty bench where he met Cis with a bouquet of roses intending to confess his feelings to her, not realizing that the android he destroyed earlier and the girl he fell for are one and the same. ; : :Barnaby's childhood caretaker and aunt. When Barnaby asks her about what she was doing on the day his parents were murdered, she claims that she was sick in bed that day. However, she then discovers a photo of herself with Barnaby at a Christmas festival instead of Maverick as Barnaby remembered. She plans to reveal it to Kotetsu, but Maverick, using his influence with Ouroboros, orchestrates a crime to keep the heroes occupied and uses the opportunity to kidnap her. Maverick quickly murders Taylor and burns the picture, framing Kotetsu for the crime as he had gone to Taylor's house the night before to meet with her. ; : : Stern Bild City's first superhero and father of Yuri Petrov, better known as the vigilante NEXT Lunatic. He was the one who inspired Kotetsu to accept his powers and become a superhero himself and taught his son to never turn a blind eye to evil. After his death, other NEXT follow his example, leading to society's current acceptance of NEXT and heroes. His power seemed to be increased strength and durability, which contrasted with his out-of-shape appearance. Mr. Legend faced the same fading power problem Tiger faces, and turned to alcohol to drown his sorrows, pressured by the public's expectations. In addition, the other heroes of his time would put up a ruse, apprehending criminals then falsifying police records to give Mr. Legend credit, which kept him at the top of the rankings. Mr. Legend was killed by his son after he beat his wife in a drunken rage, the emotional strain causing Yuri's powers to awaken for the first time. His spirit continues to torment Yuri many years later, questioning the validity of his actions. ; : : The new president of Apollon Media during the events of Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. Schneider is a cold, arrogant, and corrupt executive, seeing NEXT as inhuman and wanting to replace Hero TV with a program where NEXT fight to the death against dangerous animals. He has stepped on a number of people over the years to get to his current position, causing a group of NEXT to seek revenge against him for ruining their lives. His numerous crimes are eventually exposed by Yuri Petrov after a failed execution as Lunatic. Second League Heroes The Second League is composed of heroes in training meant to be the next generation of heroes, who do not get exposure on Hero TV and who are not sponsored by companies. The Second League featured in the series is shown to be fairly incompetent and ineffective compared to their First League superiors. The Second League typically deals with very minor crimes such as purse-snatching. Kotetsu \\"Wild Tiger\\" Kaburagi and Barnaby Brooks Jr. are briefly members of the Second League as their during the events of Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. ; : : One of the Second League heroes, the green-haired Ms. Violet dresses in a purple and green outfit with a visor. She possesses the power to fire her fingernails, which she claims are coated in a highly potent paralytic agent, but the most they have ever been shown to do is give criminals a slight itch. ; : A heavy- set Second League hero styled after a samurai. He possesses the power to spray high volumes of sweat from his hands, which is considered more of a nuisance than a hindrance to criminals. He appears to be equipped with a large katana, but is never seen using it. ; : : A Second League hero wearing an orange and white outfit, Bombeman has the ability to breathe underwater, severely limiting his effectiveness in the field. ; : Dressed in a white and blue outfit with a translucent purple helmet, Chopman possesses the ability to grow his hands to enormous sizes, which causes them to sometimes get stuck in narrow spaces.

Personal life  William Stafford was born in Patna, Ayrshire, Scotland, on November 15, 1842. He was the only son of William Stafford, an English mining engineer and geologist, and Margaret Findlay Stafford. On December 31, 1863, he married Jane Gibb of Auchinleck, Ayrshire, Scotland, whose brother David Gibb became a prominent contractor in British Columbia. While residing in Auchinleck, William and Jane Stafford had three sons: William, Jr., Henry, and John. They then emigrated to Westville, Nova Scotia, in 1871, where they had five additional sons (Richard, Alexander, George, David, and James) and two daughters (Agnes and Margaret). In 1883, the family moved to the area that later became Lethbridge, Alberta, where they had an additional son (Elliott) and two additional daughters (Henrietta, the first white child born in the area, and Annie Laurie). The Staffords constructed a large ranch house on the bottomlands of the Belly River which became a major community and social center.  Career After an education in Scotland, William Stafford became the manager of coal mines operated by the Acadia Coal Company of Pictou in Nova Scotia, and he continued in that capacity until 1882. In that year, he was hired by Sir Alexander Galt as manager and mine superintendent for the North Western Coal and Navigation Company to assess coal mining opportunities in the West. After investigating a number of possibilities, Stafford and his companion Captain Nicholas Bryant focused on Coal Banks on the Belly River due to the high quality of coal in that region. It was William Stafford who made the final decision as to the location of Drift Mine No. 1, which ultimately determined the location of the City of Lethbridge. In 1894, Stafford became Inspector of Mines for the company but then later resigned to pursue ranching and real estate interests. In order to provide accommodations for the increasing number of miners who were coming to the area, William Stafford purchased an area of land that became known as Staffordville, which he developed into lots for miners' houses. Stafford maintained an interest in coal mining, and at the time of his death, he was operating a private coal mine near Carmangay, north of Lethbridge.  Death and legacy  William Stafford died on May 12, 1907, and was buried in the family plot in Mountain View Cemetery in Lethbridge. Following his death and the Belly River flood of 1908, the Stafford family moved into the city of Lethbridge. A collection of historic photographs, documents, and personal items of William Stafford and his family is currently housed in the Galt Museum & Archives in Lethbridge. The section of north Lethbridge known as Staffordville (built around the No. 3 coal mine) as well as Stafford Drive and Stafford Place (a 10-story residential building) in Lethbridge were named in William Stafford's honor. A plaque honoring William Stafford and other coal pioneers, donated by the Lethbridge Miner's Library Club in collaboration with the Lethbridge Historical Society, was unveiled in Indian Battle Park on September 2, 1963. Entitled \\"Here We Begin to Mine the Coal,\\" the plaque reads in part: \\"In 1882, William Stafford chose this place for the North West Coal and Navigation Company to begin mining coal, thus determining the location of Lethbridge.\\"  References  1842 births 1907 deaths Coal miners History of Lethbridge Scottish emigrants to Canada Scottish people of English descent Scottish mining engineers People from East Ayrshire ","title":"William Stafford (mining engineer)"},{"id":"42447866","text":"' (), officially titled To amend the Act entitled An Act to regulate the height of buildings in the District of Columbia to clarify the rules of the District of Columbia regarding human occupancy of penthouses above the top story of the building upon which the penthouse is placed, is a United States Public Law that amends the Height of Buildings Act of 1910 in order to allow some penthouses to be built on the tops of buildings in District of Columbia. Background Current DC code allow things like air conditioners to be up to 18.6 feet taller than the roof of the building they are on. This bill would increase the height limit to 20 feet, tall enough to allow structures that humans can inhabit. The United States Congress started limiting the height of all buildings in DC in 1899. These height restrictions allow major monuments to be visible from a distance. The change made by the bill was recommended by a study conducted by the National Capital Planning Commission and the D.C. Office of Planning. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill would amend the District of Columbia Code to permit the construction or use for human occupancy of a penthouse which is erected to a height of one story of 20 feet or less above the level of the roof of the building upon which the penthouse is placed. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on March 12, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4192 would have no effect on the federal budget. The legislation would amend the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, which limits the height of buildings in District of Columbia The legislation would allow human occupancy of certain building penthouses that are currently limited to mechanical uses (such as climate control or elevators). Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4192 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The bill H.R. 4192 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 11, 2014 by Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R, CA-49). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The bill passed in the House on April 28, 2014 in Roll Call Vote 178 by a vote of 367-16. On May 6, 2014, the United States Senate voted with unanimous consent to pass the bill. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on May 16, 2014. Debate and discussion D.C.'s delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) supported this bill, saying that \\"this bill is not a mandate directing the city to make any changes to penthouses or to its existing comprehensive plan or local zoning laws more generally.\\" Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) said that he favored the bill, acknowledging that \\"the District of Columbia has a unique visual requirement.

British key type revenue stamps with an appropriate inscription were issued on the island until 1966, when revenue stamps showing various scenes and symbols of the island began to be issued. The last set of stamps was issued in 1976. From around 1920 to the 1970s, hundreds of contribution stamps were issued for National Insurance and related schemes. Revenue =1889‚Äì1966= Since the Isle of Man was politically separate from the United Kingdom, it had a different fiscal system and did not use British revenues (although it used British postage stamps). Revenues were needed to pay fees connected to transfers of land and property. The first series came out in 1889, and they were British key types portraying Queen Victoria with the inscription ISLE OF MAN in the bottom tablet. From 1894 some stamps were surcharged with the same face value in black in order to make the denomination easier to see. Similar key types were used for many years, with stamps bearing the portraits of the following monarchs: *Queen Victoria (1889‚Äì95) *King Edward VII (1903‚Äì15) *King George V (1921) *King George VI (1951) *Queen Elizabeth II (1960‚Äì61) Most of these stamps are hard to find, and some of them command high prices for collectors. In fact, the Isle of Man's rarest stamp is the King George V ¬£5 from 1921. According to Barefoot, only seven used examples exist. =1966‚Äì1976= A new set of revenue stamps was issued on 5 July 1966. Unlike the previous issues, these were not key types, but each value had a different colour and design: *6d ‚Äì Peel Castle *1/- ‚Äì Tynwald Hill (commemorating Godred Crovan) *2/- ‚Äì The Nunnery (commemorating Sir George Goldie) *2/6 ‚Äì Bible in Manx (commemorating Rev Philip Moore) *5/- ‚Äì Lifeboat (commemorating Sir William Hillary) *10/- ‚Äì HMS Victory (commemorating Captain John Quilliam) *¬£1 ‚Äì William Christian *¬£2 ‚Äì Castle Rushen *¬£5 ‚Äì Queen Elizabeth II, and a triskelion superimposed on a Celtic cross Although the Isle of Man switched to decimal currency in 1971 along with the United Kingdom, the first decimal series of revenues was not issued until 15 October 1974 as the previous issue remained in use. The new issue had four values: *5p ‚Äì Old Grammar School, Castletown *10p ‚Äì Tynwald Hill *25p ‚Äì St German's Cathedral *50p ‚Äì Lady Isabella, a waterwheel These replaced the 1/-, 2/-, 5/- and 10/- values of the previous issue. Meanwhile, the pound values remained in use. With the exception of the ¬£5 stamp of 1966, none of the above stamps bore an inscription indicating they were revenue stamps. To prevent people from attempting to use them for postage, on 18 June 1975 the four decimal stamps issued in 1974 (5p, 10p, 25p and 50p) and two of the pound values from 1966 (¬£1 and ¬£2) were issued overprinted REVENUE. On 1 November 1976, a new set inscribed ISLE OF MAN REVENUE was issued. It consisted of seven values (5p, 10p, 25p, 50p, ¬£1, ¬£2 and ¬£5), which depicted coins, heraldic symbols, ships or castles. This was the last set of Isle of Man revenues ever issued. Unlike the keytypes, the 1966‚Äì76 issues were sold to collectors in presentation packs or as singles in mint condition, and therefore unused stamps are more commonly found. However they are still harder to find in used condition. National Insurance The Isle of Man also issued contribution stamps for National Insurance and its predecessor schemes. In around 1920, British National Health Insurance stamps were overprinted for use on the island, and these were replaced by overprints on British Health & Pensions Insurance stamps in around 1930. After National Insurance was established in 1948, British issues were once again overprinted. From 1969 onwards, a new design depicting the triskelion was issued, although overprints on British issues also continued. Hundreds of National Insurance stamps were issued until the 1970s, and many of them are rare.

Voevodin (; born 13 May 1949) M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., FRCPath is Russian-born biomedical scientist and educator. He is considered one of the leading early pioneers of HIV/AIDS research. As Head of the AIDS Control Center of the Russian Federation in the early 1990s, Voevodin advocated for targeted voluntary testing among high risk groups, pushing back on the then- standard practice of mandatory testing. He is currently a private biomedical consultant (Vir&Gen;, Toronto, Canada).  Early life  Voevodin was born on May 13, 1949, in Kharkov in what was then the USSR. In his high school years he was successful in sport, but later, during his undergraduate studies, his focus changed from sports to science. After graduating high school in 1966, Voevodin entered medical school (currently Dnepropetrovsk Medical Academy, Ukraine). In 1972 he graduated as M.D. and was recruited by the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. He did his postgraduate studies in the research institutes of the academy in Moscow and Sukhumi. In 1977, Voevodin defended his Ph.D. thesis \\"Antigenic characterization of primate oncogenic viruses\\" at the Ivanovsky Virology Institute, Moscow. His mentor was Prof. Boris Lapin ().  Academic career  In the late 1970s-80s, Voevodin worked at the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Sukhumi. His research focused on the oncogenic viruses, mostly of non-human primates. In 1984 he defended his D.Sc. dissertation \\"Immunology of Primate Oncogenic Viruses\\" at the Herzen Oncology Institute, Moscow. While being Head of AIDS Control Center of Russian Federation in the early 1990s he advocated targeted voluntary testing of high risk groups as opposed to universal mandatory screening. After collapse of the USSR, Voevodin worked at the Karolinska Hospital/Institute, Sweden. In 1993 he joined the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine. Working there he published a number of papers in research journals, most notably on the identification of the Middle Eastern lineage of human retrovirus HTLV-1, genetic resistance to HIV/AIDS and interspecies transmission of retroviruses in non-human primates. The latter contributed to establishing the origin of HIV-1. In 1999 the Royal College of Pathologists, London, UK awarded Voevodin a title of Fellow (FRCPath) by virtue of his published research.

Biography  = Early life = Brauchitsch was born in 1911 as the eldest son of the future Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, and his first wife Elisabeth von Karstedt, a rich heiress in Pomerania. = Military career = In 1931, Brauchitsch joined the pilot training at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Air Transport School) at Schlei√üheim. He and 29 other trainees attended what was called Kameradschaft 31 (camaraderie of 1931), abbreviated \\"K 31\\". Among the members of \\"K 31\\" were future Luftwaffe staff officers G√ºnther L√ºtzow, Wolfgang Falck, G√ºnther Radusch and Hannes Trautloft. In 1932, he joined a cavalry regiment of the army, and in 1934 was promoted to lieutenant. In the same year, he transferred to the air force. He first served as a pilot at the Test Center in Rechlin, and from 1935, as a technical officer in a Stukastaffel. In 1936, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was transferred to a Stukagruppe, in L√ºbeck. In December that year he was promoted to squadron commander of a Stukastaffel. In 1939, he attended the air war academy in Gatow. Also, he served as an aide to the Supreme Commander of the air force, Hermann G√∂ring. Later that year, he was promoted to captain. = World War II = In the Second World War, from May to August 1940, Brauchitsch was employed as group commander of a dive bomber unit during the lightning campaign against France and the Low Countries. In 1941, he worked with the General Staff, and by the end of 1941, he was appointed chief adjutant to G√∂ring. In 1942, he was promoted to major, in 1943, to lieutenant colonel, and in 1944, to colonel. Also in 1944, he was awarded the Pilot and Observer Badge, by G√∂ring, in gold and diamonds. He was arrested in late April 1945 by the SS, together with G√∂ring, at Berchtesgaden. The SS had orders to shoot G√∂ring, but for some reason decided not to. In May 1945, Brauchitsch, in accordance with G√∂ring's orders, approached the 36th U.S. Division of the 7th American Army, as a negotiator. As a representative of G√∂ring, he informed the Americans that G√∂ring believed the war was over, and he was ready to surrender. Brauchitsch was then held in captivity, from which he was released in 1948 (the same year his father died). In March 1946, he was interrogated at the Nuremberg Trials as a witness to major war crimes as well as his own personal experience of G√∂ring and top Nazi chieftains.\\"Brauchitsch testifies at Nuremberg Trial\\".

In 1961, he became managing director of the sister company WASAG. He was also Chairman of the National Association of Schleswig-Holstein Employers Organizations, the employers' association for the chemical industry and plastics processing in Schleswig-Holstein. In addition, he served on the board of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations. Brauchitsch died in December 1974.

One economist's analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.\\"The Deadweight Loss of Christmas\\", American Economic Review, December 1993, 83 (5)\\"Is Santa a deadweight loss?\\" The Economist 20 December 2001 Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory.

Preparation =Christmas club= Christmas clubs are savings programs, the first of which were offered by various banks in the United States during the Great Depression. The concept is that bank customers deposit a set amount of money each week into a special savings account, and receive the money back at the end of the year for Christmas shopping. For decades, financial institutions competed for the holiday savings business, offering enticing premiums and advertising items such as tokens. The Dime Saving Bank of Toledo, Ohio, issued a brass token \\"good for 25 cents in opening a Christmas account\\" for 1922-1923. There were also numbered tokens issued by the Atlantic Country Trust Co. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, inscribed on the reverse: \\"Join our Christmas Club and Have Money When You Need It Most.\\" In the February 2006 issue of Forbes magazine, business writer James Surowiecki summarized the accounts' appeal: \\"The popularity of Christmas club accounts isn't a mystery; if their money was in a regular account, people assumed they'd spend it.\\"Surowiecki, James. \\"Bitter Money and Christmas Clubs.\\" Forbes.com. 14 February 2006. =Sears Wish Book= The Sears Wish Book is a popular Christmas-gift catalog released by Sears Holdings Corporation, annually in September.

In the 2007 edition of the catalog, half of the total number of pages was devoted to Christmas toys and the remainder focused on other store items including appliances, tools, clothes and jewelry. Commencement =Christmas creep= Christmas creep is a merchandising phenomenon in which merchants and retailers exploit the commercialized status of Christmas by moving up the start of the holiday shopping season. The term was first used in the mid-1980s. It is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before Black Friday in the United States and before Halloween in Canada. The term is not used in the UK and Ireland, where retailers call Christmas the \\"golden quarter\\", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit.Zoe Wood (Tuesday 21 December 2010) Snow chaos raises fears for Christmas dinners minus the trimmings The Guardian It can apply for other holidays as well, notably Valentine's Day, Easter and Mother's Day. The motivation for holiday creep is for retailers to lengthen their selling interval for seasonal merchandise in order to maximize profit and to give early-bird shoppers a head start on that holiday. However, it is not clear that this practice has been consistently beneficial for retailers. =United States= DC USA shopping center in Washington, D.C. on Black Friday Black Friday is the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States (the fourth Thursday of November), often regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. In recent years, most major retailers have opened extremely early (increasingly even on the night of Thanksgiving itself, albeit not without controversy) and offered promotional sales to kick off the holiday shopping season, similar to Boxing Day sales in many Commonwealth nations. Black Friday is not a holiday, but California and some other states observe \\"The Day After Thanksgiving\\" as a holiday for state government employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal holiday such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the day after off, followed by a weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers. It has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005,; ShopperTrak, Press Release, (16 November 2010). although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate, have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time.E.g., Albert R. Karr, \\"Downtown Firms Aid Transit Systems To Promote Sales and Build Good Will,\\" Wall St. J., p. 6 (26 November 1982); Associated Press, \\"Holiday Shoppers Jam U.S. Stores,\\" The New York Times, p. 30 (28 November 1981). In recent years, countries other than America have begun observing Black Friday, including Canada, the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, although the use of the term 'Black Friday' is not ubiquitous in these countries. =Mexico= El Buen Fin is an annual nationwide shopping event in Mexico, in existence since 2011 and taking place on the third weekend of November in Mexico, and the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.

Duration =Christmas market= Christmas market in Jena, Germany A Christmas market is a street market associated with the celebration of Christmas during the four weeks of Advent. These markets originated in Germany, Austria, South Tyrol, North Italy and many French regions such as Alsace, Lorraine, Savoy, but are now being held in many other countries. The history of Christmas markets goes back to the Late Middle Ages in the German-speaking part of Europe and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire that includes many eastern region of France and Switzerland. Dresden's Striezelmarkt was first held in 1434. The Christmas markets of Bautzen (first held in 1384), Frankfurt (first mentioned in 1393) and Munich (1310) were even older. The Vienna \\"December market\\" was a kind of forerunner of the Christmas market and dates back to 1294. =Christmas Price Index= The Christmas Price Index is a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator, maintained by the U.S. bank PNC Wealth Management, which tracks the cost of the items in the carol \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\". PNC compiles both a \\"Christmas Price Index\\" and \\"The True Cost of Christmas.\\" The \\"Christmas Price Index\\" is calculated by adding the cost of the items in the song. The \\"True Cost of Christmas,\\" however, is calculated by buying a partridge in a pear tree on each of the twelve days, buying two turtle doves from the second day onward, for a total of 22 turtle doves, etc., for the complete set of 364 items. Conclusion =United States= Super Saturday is the last Saturday before Christmas, a major day of revenue for American retailers, marking the end of the shopping season they and many customers believe begins on Black Friday. Super Saturday targets last-minute shoppers. Typically the day is ridden with one-day sales in an effort to accrue more revenue than any other day in the Christmas and holiday season. Christmas Day =Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004= The Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 (c 26) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It prevents shops over 280 m¬≤/3,000 sq ft from opening on Christmas Day in England and Wales. Shops smaller than the limit are not affected. The Act was introduced to the House of Commons by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham as a Private Member's Bill on 7 January 2004. The aim of the Act was to keep Christmas Day a \\"special\\" day, whereby all major retailers would be closed. Although it was traditional for major retailers to close on 25 December, some retailers, such as Woolworths, began to open some stores in the late 1990s. Both religious groups and shop worker unions were against the idea of Christmas openings, leading to pressure on the Government to pass legislation to prevent the practice. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament debated a similar law that would apply to shops in Scotland. The law was enacted in 2007 and it contained special provisions for New Year's Day retail activities too.Christmas Day and New Year's Day Trading (Scotland) Act 2007 Accessed 21 January 2013 Criticism =Unwanted gifts= Economist Joel Waldfogel noted that because of the mismatch between what the giftee values the gift and the value paid for by the giver, the gifts lose between 10% to one-third of their value; he calls it the \\"deadweight loss of Christmas\\". This leads to gifts often being returned, sold, or re-gifted. In a 2016 European online survey, 15% of respondents were unhappy about their gifts and 10% could not remember what they had received. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they had re-gifted their presents to someone else, 14% sold the items, 10% tried to return them to the store, and 5% returned the gift to the giver. Seniors were more likely to send their unwanted presents to charity, while those aged 25 to 34 \\"simply threw them away\\". Gifts that are least likely to be appreciated rely on personal tastes, and include items like perfumes and cosmetics, ornaments, and clothing. =Buy Nothing Christmas= Buy Nothing Christmas is an ongoing protest and reaction to the commercialization of the North American Christmas season. It started unofficially in 1968, when Ellie Clark and her family decided to publicly disregard the commercial aspects of the Christmas holiday. Contemporarily a movement was created to extend Adbusters' Buy Nothing Day into the entire Christmas season. Buy Nothing Christmas first became official in 2001 when a small group of Canadian Mennonites created a website and gave the movement a name.Priesnitz, Wendy. \\"A Buy Nothing Christmas.\\" Natural Life Magazine, November/December 2006.

Along the way, the pipeline would have picked up more crude oil from the South Lokichar Basin and other oil fields in northwestern Kenya and delivered it to Lamu for export. South Sudan had also planned to construct a pipeline from its Unity State, linking to the UKCOP as an alternative to its only current oil export route through Port Sudan in its northern neighbor Sudan. Location The pipeline was to originate in the oil-rich Kaiso-Tonya area, west of the town of Hoima, in western Uganda and snake its way through the northwestern Kenyan town of Lokicor to end at Lamu, on the Indian Ocean. In August 2015, the presidents of Kenya and Uganda agreed on the proposed route of the pipeline. The route, as proposed by the selected consultant, was long. Background Uganda has proven crude oil reserves of 6.5 billion barrels, about 2.2 billion of which is recoverable. The country has the fourth-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Nigeria, Angola, and South Sudan. Buseruka Subcounty in Hoima District has been selected to be the location of Uganda's only oil refinery. The country's strategy is to build a refinery that meets the petroleum products needs of Uganda and its regional neighbors and to export the rest of crude oil production via a pipeline to Lamu. From the beginning, the preference of the Ugandan government had been to start with a small production capacity refinery to prolong the production longevity of its new oil discoveries. Initially, this preference conflicted with the wishes of the three major exploration companies in the country, which preferred rapid harvesting and export of the crude via pipeline to the Kenyan coast. After much recrimination, in April 2013 the government agreed with Tullow Oil of the United Kingdom, Total SA of France, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to build both the oil refinery and the pipeline. Construction The route would have covered approximately inside Kenya, with most of the route underground. The pipeline would have been heated and would have used pump stations along the way. Because of the waxy nature of the oil found in both countries, it would have remained solid below . The three east African governments of Kenya and Uganda agreed in principle to construct this pipeline. In June 2014, the three countries advertised for a single consultant and transaction adviser to oversee the feasibility studies and construction design for the pipeline. A single consultant was preferred to maintain consistency in quality across the entire pipeline in Uganda and Kenya. In November 2014, Kenya and Uganda jointly selected Toyota Tsusho as the consultant for the pipeline. A contractor was expected to be selected in January 2015. Change of plans In March 2016, the presidents of Tanzania and Uganda jointly announced plans to build a competing pipeline, the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania Crude Oil Pipeline. With these new developments, Kenya is expected to go alone in building its own pipeline from Lochichar to Port Lamu.

Today, The Hippodrome Theater has been restored to a fully functioning performance venue in hopes of reclaiming its prominent role in African-American cultural history.  Early history  The Hippodrome Theater was opened in 1914 by Charles A. Somma as a vaudeville and movie theater. The theater played a major role in the entertainment of Richmond's African-American community during the early 20th century.Fuller-Seeley, K. (2002). Celebrate Richmond Theater. Richmond: The Dietz Press. (Pages 82-89) It is located on Second Street in Richmond, which was once known as The Deuce. The Deuce was a famous center of black commerce in Richmond and the street was lined with stores, restaurants, banks, and theaters. Essentially, The Deuce was the esteemed location in Richmond for black nightlife and The Hippodrome Theater was one of The Deuce's leading attractions from the 1920s to the 1940s. During this period, Richmond's African-American community was heavily influenced by New York City's Harlem Renaissance and the theater attracted big performers who were prominent in the cultural movement's performance scene. These performers included talents such as Billie Holiday, Bill Robinson, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Moms Mabley, James Brown, Ida Cox, Ella Fitzgerald and countless others who performed on the Hippodrome's stage.Baldwin, B.

Somma by the Abe Lichtman theater chain.  History: 1940s to 1980s  In 1945, The Hippodrome Theater caught fire. The origin of the fire was never fully determined, although it was believed to be caused by a short circuit in the theater's wiring. In 1947, The Hippodrome reopened its doors to the public. After the fire the theater was renovated and remodeled in an Art Deco style of architecture.Ronald Stalling [current owner of the Hippodrome Theater], personal interview with the owner, March 28, 2014 The updated theater included new features such as air conditioning and the latest technical equipment. The elaborate ceremony for the reopening of the historical theater attracted an impressive crowd of 2,500 individuals. Once the theater was reopened after the fire, it functioned primarily as a movie theater throughout the 1950s. The Hippodrome Theater closed again in the 1960s, re-opened again, then closed once again in the 1970s and functioned as a church for a short period of time. The Hippodrome Theater reopened in the 1980s as a movie theater .  Present  The current owner of the Hippodrome Theater is Ronald Stalling. The Hippodrome Theater still remains a functioning theater that continues to hold performances on the legendary stage as well as offering film showings. Directly beside the theater lies the Taylor Mansion, which was originally the home of Rev. William Lee Taylor. The mansion was built in 1907 by the architect John A. Lankford and today it functions as the Speakeasy Grill restaurant, which specializes in southeastern cuisine. The Hippodrome Theater and the Taylor Mansion are part of Stalling's current project of returning Jackson Ward and the notorious Second Street to the important African-American cultural sphere it functioned as during the early 20th century.

On 15 July 2015, the new LafargeHolcim Group was officially launched. In June 2016, Le Monde reported that Lafarge paid taxes to ISIS middlemen in 2013 to 2014 to keep using their factory in Jalabiya, Northeastern Syria. On 2 March 2017, the Board of Directors of LafargeHolcim issued a statement indicating that the measures required to continue operations at the plant were unacceptable. A comprehensive and independent investigation revealed significant errors in judgment that were inconsistent with the company's code of conduct and the company took action. There have been significant changes and developments made to the compliance program and infrastructure since the time of the alleged misconduct. The former CEO, Eric Olsen, resigned in April 2017 because of the \\"strong tensions\\" incurred by the news. However, an investigation conducted by Baker McKenzie concluded Olsen was not responsible for the payments. In an interview with the French newspapers LeFigaro, Beat Hess, Chairman of the Board said: \\"Unacceptable errors were made that the Group regrets and condemns.

As of June 30, 2018, Harlingerode had a population of 3,068.  Geography  Harlingerode lies between 190 and , increasing in height in southern direction. The Langenberg in the south is the most dominant landmark with its height of up to 304 m. The town is impenetrated by the Hurle, a tributary of the Oker.  History  = Etymology = The stem Harl- is derived from a settlor Herilo, which is ultimately rooted in a Proto-Germanic stem *harjaz meaning \\"army\\", still visible in German \\"Heer\\" and obsolete English \\"here\\". -ingerode is a locally widespread ending around the northern Harz region that served as a generic suffix for town names derived by any personal names (compare G√∂ttingerode, Bettingerode). = Timeline = Harlingerode was founded between the 9th and 10th century by the Saxon House of Billung.Gerhard K√∂bler: Bode in der deutschen Ortsgeschichte, 2016-12-21 on koeblergerhard.de, written on Dezember 21, 2016, called on September 13, 2017 [German] Harlingerode was first mentioned as Gut Heregeltingerode (Estate of Heregeltingerode) on June 3, 1053 in a deed of donatio by Henry III and as Herlingerode in 1181. In June 1865, the Hansa Pit was opened south of the village on the outskirts of the Langenberg. It was under operation until August 1960, with a short shutdown between 1932 and 1935. The village gained further importance during the 1930s when activities of mining industry were drastically increasing. The Harlingerode Zinc works was built in 1934, which made up the technologically most modern zinc mill in Germany up to the 70's. The demand of housing space owing to the immigration of mineworkers caused to rebuild the abandoned village G√∂ttingerode south of the main town in the same year. As an aftermath of World War II, the Harlingerode dramatically grew in population due to Flight and expulsion of Germans from 1944 to 1950, peaking at a population of 6,257 in 1950 including G√∂ttingerode. Several construction projects were initiated to create living space from the 1950s to 1970s. Harlingerode was incorporated into the city of Bad Harzburg on July 1, 1972. During the 1980s, the Bundesautobahn 36 was supposed to be constructed north of Harlingerode, which was later realised as the autobahn-like Bundesstra√üe 6. Thus, a land consolidation was executed between 1977 and 1983. The local rail station was taken out of service in 1983. After a drastic decrease of profitability due to falling metal prices, said zinc mill dropped its main processing in 1970 and further secondary activities in 2000. Several succeeding companies of recycling and zinc oxide industry have settled down since the 1990s. 20-Tage- Lager.JPG|Partial building of the Harlingerode Zinc works, 2009 Bahnhof Harlingerode S√ºdblick November 2018.jpg|Former Harlingerode rail station, 2018 Bundesstra√üe 6 Harlingerode Westblick.jpg|Bundesstra√üe 6 north of Harlingerode.

His military career took him from being a sub-poruchik in the Imperial Russian Army to the leadership of the State Inspectorate of the Army of the UNR. Subsequently, he served as in the diplomatic corps of the UNR to the Ottoman Empire and the Baltic States, and went on to play a major role in the Ukrainian American community as an exile in the United States. Biography =Early years= Kedrowsky was born in Kherson into a family of landowners originally of Prussian origin of Ostoja. His father's and mother's families had considerable land holdings along the Inhul and Inhulets rivers. He began his studies at home with his two younger brothers, and mastered Greek, German and a number of Slavic languages. After his father's death, he and his brothers lived on the estate of their maternal grandfather Mykola Lyps'kyi. In his autobiography \\"Outlines of the Past\\" (¬´–û–±—Ä–∏—Å–∏ –º–∏–Ω—É–ª–æ–≥–æ¬ª) Kedrowsky wrote that the family spoke mainly in Ukrainian, and that his grandfather gave him Ukrainian-language books. In 1905, Kedrowsky and some of his peers came under the influence of the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party, which argued that social liberation was not possible without Ukrainian national liberation. Several revolutionary groups were formed by Kherson youth. They adhered to the political program of the Socialist Revolutionaries, but were under the influence and leadership of Ukrainophiles. The groups staged performances of Ukrainian plays as propaganda campaigns among the Ukrainian peasantry, but these were soon banned, and many of the group members were arrested. Kedrowsky escaped arrest by illegally leaving the country in early 1907.Olenkovs'kyi web page Kedrowsky graduated from the Kherson Realgymnasium, and completed his education at the Naval School. However, his Ukrainian anti-Imperial activism (especially among sailors) prevented him from obtaining a position with the Imperial Russian Navy. He moved to Odessa, where he studied at the Imperial Novorossiya University from 1907 to 1911, obtaining a degree in statistics and economics. After graduating, Kedrowsky married fellow Kherson native Marta Odarik. =Early political life= Since his youth, Kedrowsky belonged to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party, and was a member of the Kherson Hromada. From 1911 to July 19, 1914 he worked in the Kherson Zemstvo as an employee and then the head of the Statistical Division. In his autobiography, he described the Zemstvo as a citadel of Ukrainophiles. The Board sought permission from the government for the teaching of the Ukrainian language in public schools, and that all public libraries distributed Ukrainian books. While at the Zemstvo, Kedrovskiy conducted a study that revealed the loss of literacy among people whose schooling was in Russian, but who later had no access to literature written in their native Ukrainian. Based on these results, Kedrowsky conducted a review of public education in the Kherson gubernia for 1910 and non-school educational activity in 1912. For this work, Kedrowsky received a silver medal on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Zemstvo. The statistical work of the Ukrainian Zemstvos became the basis of a bill on the need to teach children in their native language which was introduced in the Fourth State Duma, but which did not pass due to the outbreak of World War I. Every summer during 1912‚Äì1914 Kedrowsky had the responsibility of organizing 6-week general education courses for teachers at rural schools in the Kherson gubernia. Under the guidance of members of the Kherson Hromada, Kedrowsky structured the courses in a way that introduced about five hundred teachers to the basics of Ukrainian Studies. This had to be done carefully, however, because the curricula and lecturers had to be confirmed by the Imperial Ministry of Education, whose representatives were instructed to ensure that there was no anti-Russian \\"sedition\\".Kedrowsky, V. ¬´–ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä—ñ–Ω—Å—å–∫—ñ–π —è–∑–∏–∫¬ª —É —à–∫–æ–ª—ñ (\\"Materins'iy yazyk\\" u shkoli, \\"The Native Language\\" in Schools). –ê–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞—Ö –£–ù–°–æ—é–∑—É. (Almanac of the Ukrainian National Association). 1970. =Russian military service= On July 19, 1914 Kedrowsky was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, serving in the 48th infantry reserve regiment. From August 1914 to January 1915 he took part in battles against the German army in East Prussia. He was awarded the Order of St. George for bravery in battle. From July 1 to November 1, 1915 he attended the Odessa Military Cadet School, which he graduated at the top of his class and received the rank of praporshchik. From December 1, 1916 to June 15, 1917 he served as a gunnery commander in the Caucasian Native Mounted Division, which fought on the Galician and Rumanian fronts against Austrian, German, and Ottoman troops. Shortly afterwards, the commanders of the division forced Kedrowsky to leave, due to his pro-Ukrainian sentiments and his attempts to form a Ukrainian unit within the division. =The Ukrainian War of Independence= After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Kedrowsky was active in the Ukrainianization of military units. In May 1917 he participated in the meeting of the First National Military Congress in Kyiv, which marked a major turning point in his life. Prior to this, he had assumed that after the war Ukrainians would be free to decide their own future. But at the Congress he learned of the fierce opposition to this from the Russian side. Kedrowsky became an ardent follower of Symon Petliura, and spoke at the Congress about the need for the formation of Ukrainian national army. The Congress approved the creation of a Ukrainian General Military Committee as part of the Central Council of Ukraine. At the Second Ukrainian Military Congress in June 1917, Kedrowsky was elected Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian General Military Committee and led its Mobilization and Military Communications Section. He sought to quickly Ukrainianize military garrisons, unify the many small Ukrainian military units scattered along various fronts, and redeploy combat troops from the northern and western fronts to the southern and Romanian fronts. He was, however, met with strong resistance from the Russian Provisional Government and the Russian military command. In late August 1917 the Russian Provisional Government began to limit the powers of the Ukrainian Central Council. At Kedrowsky's initiative, a secret committee was formed to protect the national rights of Ukraine, consisting of himself, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Mykola Porsh, Mykhailo Tkachenko, Mykola Kovalevskyi, M. Saltan, and Symon Petliura. On September 1, 1917, he was appointed Deputy Secretary of Military Affairs in the Ukrainian People's Republic, and received the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the Ukrainian People's Army. He resigned his position in March 1918 in protest of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the subsequent entry of German troops into Ukraine. From April to October 1918 he led the Statistical Bureau and the Department of Education and Libraries in the Kherson Zemstvo. In November, 1918, as Pavlo Skoropadskyi's Hetmanate was collapsing, Kedrowsky had an emergency meeting with Yevhen Konovalets and Fedir Chernyk of the Sich Riflemen. On November 15, he was appointed Chief of Mobilization and Quartermaster General for the army of the Directorate and promoted to colonel. He later took part in street battles against Bolshevik forces in Kyiv. In early 1919 he was the military attach√© of the UNR to the Ottoman Empire, and served as chairman of the commission investigating the \\"Oskilko Affair\\". In April 1919, Kedrowsky was named special operations commander under Oleksander Osetsky. His investigatory trips to the front left him so disappointed that he proposed the formation of an Army agency responsible for restoring order. Based on his proposal, a State Inspectorate was created by the UNR, and on May 16 received the command from Petliura to take the duties of Chief State Inspector of the Army of the UNR.Kedrowsky, V. –û–±—Ä–∏—Å–∏ –º–∏–Ω—É–ª–æ–≥–æ In December 1919 he began a string of diplomatic assignments as UNR ambassador to Latvia, Estonia and Finland. In 1920 he was a UNR delegate at the Russian-Polish peace negotiations that lead to the Treaty of Riga, and in 1921 was a special military representative of the Directory and personal representative of Petliura to the Turkish government. At the beginning the War, his wife Marta and their four children lived in Kherson with her parents. By the early 1920s, their children and the entire Odarik family had died, and Marta had rejoined her husband in the Baltics. =Exile= After the complete occupation of Ukraine by the Bolsheviks, a return by Kedrowsky and his wife to their homeland would have been suicidal. Instead, they settled in Baden, Austria, where he held the presidency of the Ukrainian Fellowship of Supporters of the League of Nations, and was elected vice-president of the Association of Ukrainian Journalists in Europe. In December 1923, Kedrowsky and his wife immigrated to the United States. He first found employment in the residential building construction industry, and became active in Ukrainian-American organizations. In the late 1920s, he was a member of the School Council of the Association of Ukrainian American Organizations, which sought to reform and standardize the teaching of the Ukrainian language to Ukrainian-American children. Later, he purchased a farm in New Jersey, and worked as a film producer for the Ukrainian Canadian Motion Picture Company, as well as producer-director of Ukrainian live theater productions. Kedrowsky served as co-editor of the Svoboda newspaper from 1926 to 1933.Myshuha, Lukash (1936) –ü—Ä–æ–ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ –£–ù–° (Propamiantna knyha UNS), Jersey City, NJ. p. 46, 339‚Äì340 In March 1932, his wife Marta died, and in October 1932 Kedrowsky married Katherine Schutock (Shattuck). Katherine was a graduate of City College, and was active participant in the Ukrainian-American community, being a charter member and treasurer of the Ukrainian National Women's League of America. Their son George was born in 1936. From 1941 to 1955 he worked for the General Cable Corporation in Perth Amboy, and from 1955 to 1963 he worked for the United States Department of State and served as the chief of the Ukrainian Service of the Voice of America.Svoboda, vol. 70, no. 185, September 28, 1963 He died in Metuchen, and is buried in St. Andrew Memorial Cemetery in South Bound Brook, NJ. Documentary heritage During his life, Kedrowsky amassed a major collection of stamps, coins, books, and archival materials. Portions of his library were donated to the Library of Congress, various universities, and the library of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA (now a part of the Ukrainian Historical and Educational Center). His historically valuable archive (which includes correspondence with Symon Petliura) can now be found at the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Science in the US and the Ukrainian Historical and Educational Center of New Jersey.

The film focuses on the causes of obesity in the US, presenting evidence showing that the large quantities of sugar in processed foods are an overlooked root of the problem, and points to the monied lobbying power of \\"Big Sugar\\" in blocking attempts to enact policies to address the issue. Synopsis Fed Up shows how the first dietary guidelines issued by the U.S. government 30 years ago overlooked the role of dietary sugar in increasing risks of obesity, diabetes, and associated ill-health outcomes, particularly in children. Since these guidelines effectively condoned the unlimited addition of sugar to foods consumed by children, sugar consumption has greatly increased, obesity has skyrocketed, and generations of children have grown up far fatter than their parents. These children face impaired health and shorter lifespans as a result. As the relationship between the high-sugar diet and poor health has emerged, entrenched sugar industry interests with almost unlimited financial lobbying resources have nullified attempts by parents, schools, states, and in Congress to provide a healthier diet for children. The film concludes with a list of 20 companies, industry groups and politicians who refused to talk to the filmmakers.Lowe, Peggy (May 19, 2014). \\"'Fed Up' Portrays Obese Kids as Victims in a Sugar-Coated World.\\" NPR.org. Retrieved September 20, 2015. Production, premiere and release  The director, Stephanie Soechtig, said that she followed some of the families struggling mightily with obesity, diabetes and other health issues for more than two years during the making of the film. American journalist and TV personality Katie Couric co-produced the documentary and is its narrator. The film premiered in competition category of U.S. Documentary Competition program at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014. After its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, RADiUS-TWC acquired distribution rights of the film. The film was released on May 9, 2014 in the United States. Reception Fed Up received a positive response from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 80% of 66 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7 out of 10. In her review for LA Weekly, Amy Nicholson praised the film by saying that \\"Fed Up is poised to be the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement. (Which makes sense - producer Laurie David worked on both.)\\" Geoffrey Berkshire in his review for Variety said that \\"Stephanie Soechtig's documentary effectively gets the message out about America's addiction to unhealthy food.\\" Robert Cameron Fowler from Indiewire in his review said that \\"'Fed Up' is a glossy package that gets its warnings across loud and clear: we need to change what we eat.\\" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter praises the film as highly relevant, though overly-detailed‚Äîthe \\"Highly relevant film diminishes its central message with distracting details.\\" As Manohla Dargis succinctly summarizes in her New York Times review :Recent research ... indicates that calories in fruit are not the same as those in soda, a conclusion that is part of the big picture in ‚ÄúFed Up,‚Äù a very good advocacy documentary ... A whirlwind of talking heads, found footage, scary statistics and cartoonish graphics, the movie is a fast, coolly incensed investigation into why people are getting fatter. It also includes some touching video self-portraits by some young people who belong to the almost 17 percent of children and adolescents, 2 to 19, who are considered obese. Criticism The documentary has been criticized by some doctors and scientists as occasionally misrepresentative of scientific evidence. The film makes the claim that drinking one soda a day will increase a child‚Äôs chance of becoming obese by 60%. The scientists who are the authors of the study that this statistic comes from state that they cannot prove this causality, as the film claims, only an association. Harriet Hall of Science-Based Medicine reviewed the film in an article entitled \\"Does the Movie Fed Up Make Sense?\\" In the article she states that the film's selection of experts consists mainly of politicians and journalists with few relevant nutritional scientists or doctors. She also argues that the definitive pronouncements that the film makes about the role of sugar are premature as there are too many other possible confounders such as lifestyle, total calorie consumption and the type of foods being eaten. Hall also goes on to provide a comprehensive list of statements that the film claimed were facts but were not based on scientific evidence. She concludes by saying that \\"the film will undoubtedly do some good by helping raise public awareness of childhood obesity\\" but wishes \\"it could have done so without misrepresenting the facts\\".

He wrote extensively in an astrological vein, though he rejected the comparison with judicial astrology. Christopher Ness Life Born on 26 December 1621 at North Cave, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, he was son of Thomas Ness, a husbandman. He was at school there under John Seaman, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 17 May 1638. He graduated B.A. in 1641/2, and M.A. When 23 years Ness returned to Yorkshire, where he became an Independent preacher at South Cliffe Chapel in his native parish, in Holderness, and then at Beverley, where he taught a school. On Samuel Winter's election as provost of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1651, Ness was chosen as his successor in the living of Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire, though not in episcopal orders. In 1656 he became a preacher at Leeds, and in 1660 he was a lecturer under the vicar, John Lake; but clashed on theology. After the Uniformity Act 1662, Ness was ejected from his lectureship, and he became a schoolmaster and private preacher at Clayton, Morley, and Hunslet. At Hunslet he took an indulgence as a congregationalist in 1672, and a new meeting-house was opened by him on 3 June 1672. He was excommunicated four times, and when in 1674 or 1675 a writ de excommunicato capiendo was issued against him, he moved to London, where he preached to a private congregation in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street. In 1684 he had to conceal himself from the officers of the crown, who had a warrant for his arrest on the charge of publishing an elegy on the death of his friend Nathaniel Partridge, another nonconformist minister. Ness died on 26 December 1705, aged exactly 84 years, and was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground. Works Ness's major works were: * A History and Mystery of the Old and New Testaments, 1696. * A Protestant Antidote against the Poison of Popery. * The Crown and Glory of a Christian. * A Christian's Walk and Work on Earth until he attain to Heaven, 2nd edit. 1678‚Äì9. * A Church History from Adam, and a Scripture Prophecy to the End of the World. * An Antidote against Arminianism, 1700, a short work with a long life that became popular with Calvinists, a concise guide to doctrines such as election and predestination, as taught by John Owen, Augustus Toplady and others. It reached its sixth edition in 1838, being revised by John A. Jones, who was minister at Mitchell Street, St. Luke's, London. A new edition appeared in 1847 at London and Cambridge. John Dunton wrote that Ness wrote for him a life of Pope Innocent XI, of which the whole printing sold in two weeks. Entitled The Devil's Patriarck (1683), it had an introductory epistle by Titus Oates.

Early life Ted Constanzo was a star quarterback at Churchill High School in San Antonio. He quarterbacked his team for two years, earning player-of-the-week, all-district and, in 1974, all state honors. He was also the team's punter. He played in the 1974 Texas High School Coaches Association All-Star game and won the Thom McAn award as the city's outstanding high school football player. He had a strong arm and was a blue-chip college recruit for his passing. Constanzo was an all-around athlete, who was also a star of the track and field team where he competed in, among other things, the pole vault, and he lettered in both baseball and basketball. College career Ted Constanzo arrived at Texas at 1975 and immediately moved into the role of backup to Marty Akins because Mike Presley, who backed up Akins in 1974, had decided to leave football to focus on his education. He gained experience in blow-out wins over Colorado State, Utah State and Rice, replacing Akins late in all three games. Late in the season, he was pressed into duty against TCU when Akins hurt his knee. He led the number 7 Longhorns to a win, but he had difficulty handling the Wishbone offense. Two weeks later, he again replaced Akins when Akins re-injured his knee early in the second quarter against number 2, undefeated Texas A&M.; The Longhorns kept it close, but Constanzo threw 3 interceptions in a 20‚Äì10 loss. Akins graduated and in spring 1976 Constanzo was named the starter for the next season. Royal also considered him the starter during summer practice. However, just before the season started he was beat out for the starting position by Mike Cordaro, primarily because of Cordaro's speed. He backed Cordaro up for most of the season, playing late in a blowout win over Rice. His first chance to regain the starting position came against Texas Tech, when he took over for Cardoro in the first quarter. Despite losing Earl Campbell before halftime he was twice able to help Texas retake the lead, but Texas couldn't hold on and lost, 31‚Äì28. Constanzo played well enough to earn his only career start at quarterback the next week in a 30‚Äì0 loss to Houston in which he shared quarterback duties with Cordaro. The following week, they were both benched in favor of freshman Mark McBath. During spring practices in 1977 Constanzo was the back-up to McBath but in the following summer he injured his knee playing racquetball and had to have surgery to have it repaired. After missing most of the season, Akers planned to redshirt him. When McBath and back-up quarterbacks Jon Aune and Randy McEachern went down with injuries, Akers decided to start true freshman Sam Ansley against Baylor instead of the recovering Constanzo to preserve his medical redshirt. Constanzo had to burn his redshirt anyway, and use a whole season of eligibility, during that game to fill in not as quarterback, but as punter for an injured Russell Erxleben. During the fourth quarter of that game he also took a few snaps at quarterback and threw no passes. It would be the last time he'd take a snap as quarterback in his career, finishing with a record of 0‚Äì1 as a starter. He did continue to replace Erxleben the following week against Texas A&M.; During spring practice in 1978, Constanzo and McBath were the back-ups to Sam Ansley, with Aune expected to start the season when he recovered from his knee injury. He sat the season out, eventually redshirting, but was still considered, along with John Goodson, the back-up punter to Erxleben. In 1979, he started out as a backup quarterback and punter. John Goodson started the season as the starting place-kicker and punter, but after he averaged 32.5 yards per punt through the first two games, Akers began to let Constanzo punt. They shared punting duties in 5 of the next 6 games, with Constanzo sitting out the SMU game, but during the last four games, including the Sun Bowl, Constanzo was the team's only punter. It was during the Sun Bowl that he kicked his career best, a 60-yard punt. =Records= * UT ‚Äì Touchdown passes by a true freshman (3), surpassed by David Ash in 2011 Later life After college, Constanzo enlisted in the Army where he spent three years of active duty and 17 in the reserves. He was a combat engineer officer before earning the rank of major. He left the Army and became a coach and teacher for more than 20 years. He was the athletic coordinator and head football coach at Spring Branch Middle School, where he led his team to two undefeated seasons, and then became an assistant football and baseball coach at Smithson Valley High School.

Rather, the singer says to the listener, ‚ÄòI told me so.‚Äô \\", and concluded their review with \\"This is what Vivere ultimately conveys most arrestingly: these are the sounds of a modern troubadour living through music.\\" March 2016 found Varela touring Belgium and The Netherlands to promote the release of his new CD. June and July saw Fernando singing as a special guest to trumpet player Chris Botti. July also offered Fernando the opportunity to sing in front of some 250,000 soccer fans at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate prior to Germany's Euro 2016 Semi-Final match with France. In August, Varela performed as the opening act for Lionel Richie, at the Universal Inside 2016 event at Berlin's Mercedes Benz Arena, as well as singing with the Fireworks at Potsdamer Schl√∂ssernacht at Sanssouci. He has also recently completed taping of a PBS television special that began airing beginning in March 2017, to include a live taping of his \\"Coming Home\\" concert held in front of a sold-out crowd on November 30, 2016 at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in his hometown of Orlando, Florida. A duet of \\"A Thousand Years\\" with Jackie Evancho recorded live during this concert, has been included on Evancho's CD \\"Two Hearts\\" Immediately before leaving to join Sarah Brightman on the Royal Christmas Gala tour, Fernando responded to the devastation of his home island of Puerto Rico by hurricanes Irma and Maria by organizing a benefit concert. Within a very short timeframe, Fernando produced and presented Fernando and Friends for Puerto Rico. The concert was held in the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center at The Villages, Florida, with 100% of the proceeds being given to PRxPR to aid in the recovery efforts and rebuilding of Puerto Rico. Fernando was able to give 100% of ticket sales directly to aid Puerto Rico, with every typical cost associated with presenting the concert having been donated. Fully 100% of the labor, talent and equipment for the concert was given in donation, so that all of the proceeds would go directly to help Puerto Rico. 2019 began for Varela with his production company, Victory Productions, hosting the reunited AGT finalist lineup of Forte, in an early February sold-out run of four shows at The Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center, in The Villages, Florida. The trio of Varela, Panikkar and Page brought the audience to its feet repeatedly during their four day run. A week later, Varela returned to The Sharon, as he played host to David Foster in his first visit to The Villages, in a run of four shows in which Varela also performed. In March, Varela performed in the ceremony honoring Emilio and Gloria Estefan as recipients of the 2019 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize, at the DAR Hall in Washington, DC., to be aired on PBS nationwide on May 3, 2019. David Foster, acting as a judge on Asia's Got Talent (season 3) brought in Varela and Pia Toscano to perform as part of the shows finals. Varela performed Josh Groban‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou Raise Me Up‚Äù. Among many other Charity Concerts, in May 2019, Varela performed at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Annual Hot Pink Party at the Park Avenue Armory. In summer 2019, Varela again toured in Canada with David Foster Finishing 2019, Varela appeared on David Foster's \\"An Intimate Evening with David Foster\\", hosted by PBS, and also offered to viewers as a DVD, and available to the public on CD, and download. Along with Varela, the show included Foster's wife Katherine McPhee, Pia Toscano, Loren Allred, and Shelea. The show first aired November 30, 2019. In March of 2020, Varela responded to the recent earthquake disaster in Puerto Rico with another benefit show, again with the proceeds being given to PRxPR. The show featured Four Divo, which included Varela, operatic Baritone Craig Irvin, Villages local and Harold S. Schwartz Music Scholarship recipient tenor Devin Eatmon, and Varela's fellow Forte member Josh Page. Also included is Varela‚Äôs wife soprano Susan Williams, and Puerto Rican trio Sonido Tr√©. In April, given the isolation brought upon by the coronavirus pandemic, Varela's Victory Productions responded by supporting Belleview, FL's St. Paul Parish (where Varela is acting Music Director) by producing online Sunday Masses, with Fernando and Susan Varela providing the Music Ministry. Additionally, Varela presented a number of free Livestream performances, with the request for donations to support local charities.

Background  = Rebel Army = Once the forces had been gathered in Guanare in mid-November 1859, Generals Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n and Ezequiel Zamora moved to Barinas, followed by the Western Government Army, whose commander, General Pedro Estanislao Ramos, gave the order to chase and beat them. After this retreat movement, the federal army settled in Santa In√©s, located about 36 km southwest of the city of Barinas, on the right bank of the Santo Domingo River. The federalist forces' regrouping was completed on December 9. It was then that General Zamora took a defensive position and formulated a plan that consisted of a withdrawal, executed by the front line troops, to attract the attacker to an area where they would be destroyed by a counterattack. The front line troops, in addition to channeling the action of the attackers, needed to cause as much attrition as possible, by means of using the forces in three successive lines of trenches, having a fourth line which would be the final position and wherein the attacker would receive the maximum firepower and final blow, increased by the reserve forces from the preceding lines. To comply with the above plan of attack, General Zamora made the following proposals: The advance trench was to be located in the village of La Palmas, and it was to be commanded by Colonels Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Hern√°ndez y Le√≥n Hern√°ndez; a bit further back by a mill and a hut, the first line was to beorganized under General Ignacio Antonio Ortiz; the second line to be commanded by General Rafael Petit was about 900 meters back; the third line to be led by General Pedro Aranguren was formed at 800 meters beyond, at a crossroads; finally the fourth line, 800 meters from the crossroads, where the town was, was to be the reserve. According to the plan prepared by Zamora, upon presentation of the attacker in La Palma, the federalist troops would offer little resistance and redeploy to the first position; who would then be delivered to the attacker, after some resistance the defenders would occupy the second position; then they would redeploy to the third just as in the previous line. This would leave the attackers at the mercy of the coup de grace by the reserve. This was the first time that the tactic of digging defensive trenches was performed in Latin America. = Battle = On December 8, the centralist army spent the night in the village of San Lorenzo, on the left bank of the Santo Domingo River. The next morning, the river level dropped and the centralist forces advanced towards La Palma, so federalist forces had to leave their position and go to the mill. Meanwhile, the armed camp in La Palma was attacked, and in the assault they lost about 1,800 men. On December 10, the Conservatives resumed the attack, resuming contact with the defenders of the mill (first position), who retreated after causing heavy casualties to the attacker. After the action against the first position, the attackers continued on the next position (second), which was taken after a bloody battle. After that the aim of the centralists was to conquer the third position, the strongest of which had been taken. To this end, General Ramos insisted in thorough combat with artillery support, but the position could not be taken. It was expected that there would be greater resistance before the attackers should fall under the action of forces in the village. Moreover, the attack carried out by Ramos, through an intricate entrenchment, efficiently combined with a barrage of fire, resulted in complete failure for the government forces, which had 900 losses . Convinced at last what was fruitlessness of his company, General Ramos decided to order a withdrawal, which took place on midnight of that day. Finally, on December 11 at dawn, noting the absence of the attackers, Zamora decided it was convenient to carry out the relics of the centralist army, and went in pursuit of the defeated = Consequences = General Ramos was seriously injured, they had lost all their artillery and large number of horses, and ordered the withdrawal to Barinas, in which less than 2,000 troops came, being chased by rebels. The city was besieged on December 23. After that, Zamora left with 6,000 men from Barinas to Caracas, taking places on his way. The decisive event of the war would be the Battle of Copl√© on February 17, 1860.

On this day, some churches hold a church service which recognizes that the holidays are sometimes \\"blue\\" or filled with difficult feelings around painful life events such as death, disease, poverty, or abuse. Some services may only honor people who have lost loved ones in that year, similar to an All Saint's Day service. The Holy Eucharist is traditionally a part of the service of worship on this day. This worship service is traditionally held on or around the longest night of the year, which falls on or about December 21, the Winter Solstice. There is an interesting convergence for this day as it is also the traditional feast day for Saint Thomas the Apostle. This linkage invites making some connections between Thomas's struggle to believe the tale of Jesus' resurrection, the long nights just before Christmas, and the struggle with darkness and grief faced by those living with loss. The Worship often includes opportunities for expression of grief and pain as well as an opportunity to focus on the promise of hope. Candles, arranged as an Advent wreath, are lit at numerous occasions during the service; empty chairs are reserved as a way of commemorating those who have been lost during the previous year. The images of the winter solstice which include the longest night losing to the increasing longer day after midnight is a significant part of the imagery used in the elements of this particular worship event. There are growing resources and popularity around this tradition due to the relevance for many who struggle to find joy and hope during festive seasons.

The Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg at that time was in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Dissatisfaction with inequality, the authoritarian government, the lack of civil liberties and a political system that excluded most people from government, caused widespread upheaval. This in turn forced the government to concede various reforms, particularly granting a new constitution, which introduced new civil liberties, parliamentary government, wider participation in the political system, and the separation of powers.  Background  After being annexed by the French in the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg was elevated to a Grand Duchy and awarded to the Dutch King by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. While it was supposed to be ruled by him in personal union, rather than as part of his kingdom, the King-Grand Duke William I treated it merely as a province of the Netherlands. (At the time, modern Belgium was part of the Netherlands, so Luxembourg was not separated from Dutch territory.) The Grand Duchy would also be part of the German Confederation (the successor to the Holy Roman Empire), and its fortress therefore garrisoned by Confederation troops. Luxembourg was profoundly affected by the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Many in Luxembourg supported the cause of the Belgian secessionists, and indeed most of the country was de facto annexed by the new Belgian state, while only the capital Luxembourg City remained loyal to the Dutch King, as it was garrisoned by Prussian troops. The situation was only resolved in 1839, when the Dutch King consented to the partition of Luxembourg. In the Treaty of London of 1839, the French-speaking parts of Luxembourg were carved off to form part of Belgium, while the remaining German-speaking part made up the rump Grand-Duchy, and would continue to be ruled by the Dutch King-Grand Duke, even though it was now territorially separated from the Netherlands. It would also remain in the German Confederation. In 1841, William II authorised the first constitution of Luxembourg. This document left all meaningful power in the hands of the sovereign. The legislature provided by the Constitution, the Assembly of Estates, was little more than a shadow parliament. It was elected indirectly, the ballots were not secret, and the vast majority of the population were excluded from political life by a system of census suffrage, requiring the payment of 10 florins per year in tax. At the elections of 1845, in the canton of Luxembourg, only 956 out of 28,477 inhabitants were eligible to vote. The Assembly's sessions were held in private, and its assent was required only for penal and fiscal laws, the civil list, and the extraordinary budget. In 1841, this constitution was generally welcomed, but over the years, voices started to be raised in the Assembly of Estates, demanding a return to the civil liberties which had applied under the Belgian annexation of 1830-1839. Various other issues were a cause for discontent, such as the muzzling of the press, the ban on associations, the exorbitant expenses of the civil list, and lack of judicial and educational reforms. There were several famines in the 1840s, of which the poor were the worst affected. Little was done by the authorities to deal with the consequences of these crises, at least in the eyes of the people. Furthermore, unpopular taxes caused widespread discontent. Complaints were also raised about the annual payment of 150,000 guilders to the sovereign, which weighed heavily on the state's budget. In the 1840s the government additionally restricted traditional rights of pasture and gathering firewood; the rural poor saw this as an unfair attack on their ancient rights. The 1845 law forbidding straw roofs in houses, introduced after several destructive fires, likewise burdened the poor, who could ill afford the required renovations. On top of all this, unemployment and price increases turned the economic problems into a social crisis. More and more frequently, vagabonds and beggars appeared in whole groups, demanding charity from property owners.  Events  Dissatisfaction had built up over several years, and was only waiting for a trigger. The February revolution of 1848 in Paris created a revolutionary dynamic across the continent, which threatened the monarchic and absolutist order. Amongst other things, the protest took the form of sending petitions to the authorities. Petitions, far from being a recent invention, were an old right. What was unusual was their extent, as 70 petitions were sent to the government around March, which had been more or less spontaneously drafted and signed in over 60 localities. View of Ettelbruck, the centre of the uprising, in 1944 At the same time, a broad protest movement started. The centre of the uprising was Ettelbruck, in the north of the country. On 11 March, several discontented people declared a republic and sang the Marseillaise. The gathered people blocked the way of the gendarmes who appeared on the scene, and tried to provoke them into using their guns. Fearing an extension of the uprising, the government sent further gendarmes to Ettelbruck, as a market was to take place there on 14 March. On that day, the police tried to arrest several of the ringleaders, which threatened to escalate the situation. An angry crowd gathered outside the gendarmerie station, and started throwing stones and breaking windows. A gallows was erected outside the house of the local head of the gendarmerie. The people's anger was also felt by other representatives of the authorities: a crowd attacked the house of the local tax collector. In other localities, the popular disdain for the government likewise made itself felt, and its representatives had to deal with various humiliations and insults. In the capital, a crowd gathered on 16 March. Workers from the suburbs assembled in front of the house of the mayor, Fernand Pescatore, who was suspected of wheat speculation: again, it took the gendarmerie and the Prussian military to prevent any violence. The unrest spread from Ettelbruck to the surrounding villages, and the government feared it might spread even further. \\"Revolutionary\\" flags such as the French, Belgian, black-red-gold (German) and red flags were carried during processions or put up in visible places. These flags were not so much a sign of separatism, as a symbol of solidarity with the revolutionary movements in these other countries.Schoentgen, Marc. \\"Die M√§rz-Revolution von 1848 in Luxemburg\\". In: forum, No. 185 (July 1998), p. 21-24 The Revolution ended about as quickly as it had begun, but lasted the longest in Ettelbruck, where anarchy reigned for about a week. Unrest still flared up in various areas for several weeks, but the government acted decisively to restore order, by gathering gendarmes, forestry and customs officers, and federal German troops, who were sent to the affected areas on 23 March to take down the revolutionary flags and restore order. This unusually large presence of armed forces served as a clear signal to the insurgents, but also to those who were uninvolved. Similarly, on 19 March, a pastoral letter from the Apostolic Vicar of Luxembourg, Jean-Th√©odore Laurent, was read out in all churches, appealing for calm and reminded the Catholic population of their loyalty to the throne. On 20 March, the government issued a proclamation, announcing changes to the constitution and the abolition of censorship. Acting on the advice of the government, William II had had to agree to reforms. These promises meant that most citizens and supporters of \\"law and order\\" finally went over to the government's side and distanced themselves from any further revolutionary acts. The government also agreed to employ part of the discontented poor on state construction sites, in order to take them off the streets. William II, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg at the time of the Revolution = New constitution = The King-Grand Duke established a commission to come up with revisions to the constitution. The commission, however, composed as it was by a large number of government officials, provoked widespread hostility and had to be abandoned. In accordance with article 52 of the existing Constitution of 1841, William II then called a new Assembly of Estates, with twice the normal number of delegates, with the mission to draft a new constitution.Ravarani, Georges. \\"La Constitution de 1848\\". In: forum, No. 185 (July 1998), p. 30-34 This Constituent Assembly first gathered in Ettelbruck on 25 April 1848. The reason behind meeting in Ettelbruck rather than Luxembourg City may have been the presence of the Prussian garrison in the capital, which was seen as hostile. The Assembly finished its work in record time, proceeding to the final vote confirming the new Constitution on 23 June. The Grand Duke swore an oath on the new Constitution on 10 July, and it came into force on 1 August.Thewes, Guy. Les gouvernements du Grand-Duch√© de Luxembourg depuis 1848 . Service Information et Presse, 2011. Within a few months, the Constituent Assembly had drafted a relatively liberal constitution, which made Luxembourg into a constitutional monarchy. The new Constitution was closely modelled on the Belgian one drafted in 1830‚Äîmany articles were copied word-for-word‚Äîshowing the mark left by the Belgian annexation of 1830-1839. It introduced several of the principles of a state governed by the rule of law, such as separation of powers, limiting the sovereign's powers to the executive sphere, the parliament's legislative sovereignty, an annual vote on the ordinary budget, independence of the judiciary. While the new Constitution was striking in its similarity to the Belgian one, there were also notable differences between the two. Unlike Belgium, Luxembourg's constitution provided for only one chamber of parliament, this being mainly due to the small size of the country and a lack of enough qualified people to sit in two chambers, rather than any ideological reasons. Compared with the 40 francs of annual taxation required to vote in Belgium, Luxembourg required only 10 francs (which still, however, excluded most of the population).  Legacy  = Change = The political changes brought about by the events of 1848 appear obvious: the first modern constitution for the country, the introduction of parliamentary government and civil liberties, and the creation of several new government institutions. The authority of the monarch was severely curtailed.Thewes, Guy. \\"La r√©volution de 1848: la deuxi√®me\\". In: forum, No. 193 (July 1999), p. 80-82 Whether, and to what extent, the Revolution brought about a social change, is more debatable. Political life in the early 19th century had been dominated by a bourgeoisie composed of high-ranking civil servants who valued order and authority; in 1848 they had to make way for a bourgeoisie composed of businessmen, who were more liberally inclined and who remained in control until 1919, when mass politics was introduced. The Revolution therefore saw power pass from a clique of conservative Orangist officials to another, only slightly larger, clique of liberal businessmen enriched by early industrialisation. It is doubtful, then, whether 1848 was a revolution in the social sense. 1848 did, however, see the working classes take to the streets in anger for the first time. The socialist lawyer, Charles Th√©odore Andr√©, published an appeal to the workers of Luxembourg during the Revolution. = Continuity = Most of those who had administered the country since 1841 managed to weather the storm of 1848 and remain in their posts after the coming into force of the new Constitution on 1 August. The Constituent Assembly itself was presided over by the governor, Th√©odore de la Fontaine, who was also reappointed as head of the post- Revolution government, as were 3 out of the 4 other members of the previous government (Vendelin Jurion, Charles-Mathias Simons and Jean Ulveling). There was only one resignation, that of Th√©odore Pescatore, who was replaced by Jean-Pierre Andr√©. The government merely received title changes, with the former governor becoming the \\"president of the council\\", and its members each receiving the title of \\"administrator general\\". The lines between the various political families were fluid. Conservative and progressive bourgeoisies belonged to the same social milieu: they were members of the same clubs and associations, and would meet in Masonic lodges. The different families of the bourgeoisie were all linked by intermarriage. The rest of the country, farmers, artisans, and workers, remained as excluded from political life as they had been before 1848: the Revolution changed little for them. Th√©odore de la Fontaine, governor of Luxembourg until 1848, then the first prime minister Several of the achievements of the Revolution of 1848, including the Constitution itself, proved to be quite short-lived. William II died in 1849, to be succeeded by his rather more reactionary son, William III, who described the Constitution of 1848 as \\"the work of agitated times and sinister apprehensions\\". After the dissolution of the Frankfurt Parliament, the federal diet of the Germanic Confederation in 1851 enjoined the individual states to ensure their constitutions accorded with the principle of the sovereign power of rulers. In Luxembourg, the new Constitution came under attack from various quarters, particularly the government. A bill to reform the constitution in 1856 ended up being rejected by the Chamber of Deputies, which also passed a motion condemning the government. The King used this as a pretext to dissolve the Chamber, declare the Constitution invalid and to dictate a new, authoritarian constitution, in a series of events known as the Luxembourg Coup of 1856.  Historiography  The 1848 revolution in Luxembourg has been mostly neglected by academic historiography and by history as taught in schools. Works inspired by Orangist historiography sought to downplay the events of 1848 as much as possible. Arthur Herchen's history textbook, published in 1918, was still in use in secondary schools up to the 1970s in a revised edition. It portrayed the world before 1848 as a carefree one. While admitting that there was a \\"certain nervousness\\" in the country in 1848, it goes on to claim that the Luxembourgish people were able to obtain in a peaceful manner the rights and freedoms which elsewhere were won with bloodshed, and that this was due to the great wisdom and generous initiative of the Grand-Duke.Maas, Jacques. \\"La r√©volution de 1848 n'a pas eu lieu: L'historiographie de tradition orangiste et l'oeuvre d'Albert Calmes\\". In: forum, No. 185 (July 1998), p. 52-53 The primary function of Orangist historiography was the legitimation of the Orange-Nassau dynasty. It therefore saw Luxembourgish history through a dynastic lens, in order to link the currently reigning family to the founding myth of the country. This dynastic world view ignored the wider population as an agent of history, or any mention of social or popular history: the people only appeared in narratives when they endangered the dynastic order through revolt. This brings out Orangist historiography's other characteristic, namely its anti-revolutionary nature. It therefore always denied that there was a revolution in Luxembourg in 1848. This changed in 1957 when Albert Calmes published the 5th volume of the Histoire Contemporaine du Grand-Duch√© de Luxembourg, with the unambiguous title La R√©volution de 1848 au Luxembourg. Calmes had no hesitation in terming the events of 1848 a revolution, as there was a brusque and profound social and political change. He noted that the views of traditional historiography on 1848 belonged more to the realm of myth or of a softening presentation of the facts, as it only reproduced the official utterances of those in power, in an attempt to justify the policy of the King-Grand Duke and his Orangist supporters. Calmes' work was troubling to many historians at the time: his vast publication, founded on work in the archives of the Hague and of the Luxembourgish government, undermined traditional historiography, and he criticised the works of neo-Orangists such as Prosper Mullendorff, Jules Mersch, Auguste Collart, and Paul Weber, while attacking what he saw as the \\"Orangist legend\\". This may explain why his book was mostly ignored by the press and review journals such as H√©mecht and Cahiers Luxembourgeois; likewise, the historians Nicolas Margue and Joseph Meyers did not take account of Calmes' ground-breaking work in their 1969 revised edition of Herchen's textbook.

Hitchins isolated samples from uranium ores, taking precise and accurate measurements of atomic mass that provided the first experimental evidence for the existence of different isotopes. She also helped to discover the element protactinium, which Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted should occur in the periodic table between uranium and thorium.  Education  Ada Hitchins was born on 26 June 1891 in Tavistock, Devon, England, the daughter of William Hedley Hitchins, a supervisor of customs and excise, and his wife Annie Sarah Pearsons. The family lived for a time in Campbeltown, Scotland, where Hitchins attended high school, graduating in 1909. From there, she went to the University of Glasgow, obtaining her bachelor's degree in science, with honors, in 1913. She was awarded prizes in botany and geology, as well as being accorded special distinction for her work in chemistry.  A career disrupted by war and peace  In her final year at the University of Glasgow, Hitchins began to work with Frederick Soddy. When he moved to the University of Aberdeen as the Chair of Chemistry in 1914, Hitchins and another assistant, John A. Cranston, accompanied him. At Aberdeen, Hitchins was a Carnegie Research Scholar, receiving a one-year appointment and monetary award given to a graduate of a Scottish institution for research and study by American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Expectations that Soddy would establish a thriving research center at Aberdeen were disrupted by World War I, as male students became soldiers, and women students were encouraged to graduate from accelerated courses so as to fill positions in industry and government. Hitchins was drafted to work in the Admiralty Steel Analysis Laboratories in 1916. After the war, women workers were displaced from their jobs by returning soldiers. Hitchins, released from the Admiralty, was able to find work at a Sheffield steel works. In 1921, Frederick Soddy, then at the University of Oxford, obtained funding to rehire Hitchins as a technical assistant. He had recently received the Nobel prize for his work on radioactivity and isotopes. In 1922, Hitchins became his private research assistant. She continued to work with him until 1927, when she emigrated to Kenya to be nearer to her family.  Radioactive research  Hitchins worked with Soddy over a period of 15 years, which included his most productive periods of achievement. She was his primary research assistant, and the only person to work with him for a long period of time. Her careful preparation of radioactive materials, and her painstaking experimental work with uranium, protactinium, and lead isotopes, made crucial contributions to the research for which Soddy received the Nobel Prize. = Uranium and ionium = Uranium ore When Hitchins first worked with Soddy, researchers were still searching for new chemical elements, and isotopes were not yet understood. As early as 1904, researchers had hypothesized that the decay of uranium resulted in the creation of radium, but how this occurred was not clear. In 1907, the American radiochemist Bertram Boltwood had isolated what he believed to be a new intermediate element in the decay chain between uranium and radium, \\"ionium\\". Researchers eventually determined that ionium was actually an isotope of thorium, 230Th. Soddy asked Hitchins to investigate ionium. She selectively extracted uranium from ore samples to create purified uranium preparations and established a half-life for ionium. Her research also showed that there was a steady rate of increase in the amount of radium in her uranium solutions, the first direct experimental evidence that radium was formed by the decay of uranium. Her results were published in 1915. = Atomic weight of \\"thorium\\" lead = Hitchins helped to determine the atomic weight of lead based on measurements of radioactive ores, work that was important in developing an understanding of isotopes. The samples of distilled lead which Hitchins prepared from Ceylon thorite were used by Frederick Soddy and supplied by him to Otto H√∂nigschmid, who did important work confirming that the atomic weight of thorium lead is higher than that of common lead. Soddy indicated that Hitchins also worked on the actual analyses, in his published report of 1917: \\"According to analyses by Miss A. F. R. Hitchins and myself, the 20 kilos of selected thorite worked upon contained 0-4 per cent, of lead, 57 per cent, of thorium, 1-03 per cent, of uranium, and 0-5 c.c. of helium per gram.\\" This work proved that atomic weight was not a constant. Chemically pure elements could be mixtures of isotopes with differing atomic weights. = Actinium and protactinium = Uraninite ore, a source of protactinium John A. Cranston, who had also come from Glasgow to Aberdeen with Soddy as a research assistant, was drafted in March 1915. Hitchins continued Cranston's research before she herself was drafted for war work in 1916. This research resulted in the successful identification of a new element in the decay chain between uranium-235 and actinium, later named protactinium. The discovery of protactinium completed the early version of the periodic table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev, who predicted the existence of an element between thorium and uranium in 1871. The same isotope, 231Pa, was independently discovered around the same time by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. Soddy and Cranston published their paper in 1918. Although Hitchins was not included as a co- author, Soddy gave Hitchins significant credit for the contributions she had made to the research: > The experiments were undertaken when the course of the disintegration of > uranium and its connection with radium was quite obscure, but the > experiments afford valuable data, which has never been properly discussed in > the light of recent discoveries, on the possible modes of origin of > actinium. With regard to the new work, in the absence of one of us on > military service since 1915, the experiments were continued for a time by > Miss Ada Hitchens, [sic] B.Sc, Carnegie Research Scholar, until she also > left to engage in war duties. Her valuable assistance has contributed very > materially to the definiteness of the conclusions that it has been possible > to arrive at. = Measuring radioactivity = In her early work with Soddy, Hitchins helped to prepare radium standards for the calibration of gold-leaf electroscopes, used to measure radioactivity. After she returned to work with Soddy in 1921, Hitchins further refined measurements of the half-life of ionium, and determined ratios of thorium isotopes in mineral samples. She also developed methods for extracting radioactive elements from minerals and ores. Soddy wrote of her: > I regard Miss Hitchins as an exceedingly accomplished chemist with a wide > knowledge and experience of difficult chemical and mineral analysis. It is > much to her credit that in her work with extremely rare and difficultly > obtainable materials she has never had any accident or lost any of the > material.  Later life  In 1927 Hitchins moved to Kenya, to join other members of her family who had emigrated there. Frederick Soddy wrote to the British Colonial Office, recommending her for a government position. Hitchins was employed as a Government Assayer and Chemist in the Mining and Geological Department of the Colonial Government until 1946. After her retirement, the department's annual report said of her that \\"she filled the post of Chemist and Assayer gaining an outstanding reputation for accuracy and complete reliability, and her loss was keenly felt by the mining industry.\\" In 1946, Hitchins married a farmer, John Ross Stephens (also spelled Rees). Hitchins died in Bristol, England, on January 4, 1972.

The house and remaining grounds are now Whitelands College, part of the University of Roehampton. It is situated on Holybourne Avenue, off Roehampton Lane, next to the Richmond Park Golf Course in the London Borough of Wandsworth. In 1955 it was designated Grade I on the National Heritage List for England. History =Construction= It was built for The 2nd Earl of Bessborough, an Anglo-Irish peer. Construction on the building started circa 1760, by the architect Sir William Chambers, who also designed Somerset House in London. It was completed in circa 1768. The building was inspired by Chiswick House and Foots Cray Place. A resident of Parkstead was the wife of The 3rd Earl of Bessborough, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough, a Whig hostess, gambler and socialite.Janet Gleeson An Aristocratic Affair (Bantam Press, 2006).Janet Gleeson, Privilege and Scandal: The Remarkable Life of Harriet Spencer, Sister of Georgiana (Crown Publishing Group, 2008). Lady Bessborough had a relationship with Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville, which produced two children. She had four children with her husband, Lord Bessborough. These were: John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough, Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, Lady Caroline Lamb and William Ponsonby, 1st Baron de Mauley. On the death of Henrietta, in 1821, the 3rd Earl leased the property to a politician, Abraham Robarts, who made it his permanent home. When Robarts died in 1858, The 5th Earl of Bessborough sold the house and forty-two acres of parkland to the Conservative Land Society for division into smallholdings. =Manresa House= In 1861, the house and 42 acres of surrounding land was sold to the Society of Jesus, the Jesuit religious order. The Jesuits used the building to house their novitiate and a retreat house for Ignatian spirituality. The house was renamed Manresa House after the town in Spain where Ignatius of Loyola developed his Spiritual Exercises. Within the property, the Jesuits created a cemetery. The first burial was in 1867. The cemetery contained only Jesuits, including Alban Goodier SJ, the Archbishop of Bombay from 1919 to 1926.Melissa Melikian, \\"An archaeological watching brief of the exhumation of the Jesuit Cemetery at Manresa House, Roehampton\\" from London Archaeologist, Summer 2004, pp. 230-233 From Manresa House, the Jesuits served the local Catholic congregations. In the following decades, various churches were built and staffed by the Jesuits, such as Christ the King Church, Wimbledon Park in 1877, St Joseph Church, Roehampton in 1881, Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon in 1884, Corpus Christi Church, Brixton in 1886 and St Winefride Church, South Wimbledon in 1904. In 1860, they commissioned Joseph John Scoles to design the chapel. It was completed after his death, in 1864, by his pupil S.I. Nicholl. In the 1870s, Henry Clutton designed the north aisle which expanded the chapel. Clutton later designed the long gallery connecting the chapel to the refectory in the new north wing, which was built in 1880. In 1885, the south wing, designed by Frederick Walters, was added. It copied the elevation of the north wing. With the completion of these two wings the original stable blocks were demolished.Joan P. Alcock, Where generations have trod (London: South Bank Polytechnic, 1979) from Archives Portal Europe, retrieved 18 March 2015 One of the Jesuits at Manresa House was the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. He was a novice from September 1868 until September 1870. In the 1950s, London County Council compulsorily purchased the surrounding land and part of the Jesuit land for housing. The last burial in the cemetery was in 1962. By 1962, the Jesuits decided that Manresa would no longer be suitable for a novitiate, when the design of the housing estate was altered to include high rise flats adjacent to their land. They sold the property to the council and the house became part of the Battersea College of Domestic Science. In October 1966 the college was opened by Shirley Williams who also signed the order for its subsequent closure in 1979. =Whitelands College= The house was acquired as the new home of Whitelands College in 2001, which renamed the estate Whitelands College but referred to the original house as Parkstead House once more. It is now part of the University of Roehampton.Whitelands College from AIM25, retrieved 18 March 2015 Under the guidance of English Heritage the college added extensive new buildings to incorporate lecture theatres, laboratories, classrooms and student facilities. In the 1880s, Whitelands College, while they were based in Chelsea, commissioned Morris & Co. to make stained glass for their first chapel. This was moved with the college to Putney in 1930. In 2006, the stained glass was moved to Parkstead House. This commissioning of the work happened through the efforts of John Ruskin. In 1883, he wrote to Edward Burne-Jones, on behalf of the college, asking for him and William Morris to do the work. Of the fifteen windows the college received from Morris & Co., twelve were designed by Burne- Jones and three he made with Morris. Burne-Jones used some of designs he had previously created for the windows showing saints Agnes, Celia, Catherine, Dorothy, and Margaret. All of the others were made specifically for the college. In 1886, the reredos behind the altar in the chapel was installed. Although it was designed by William Morris, it was built by Kate Faulkner, sister of Charles Faulkner.

It was based on the radio drama Challenge of the Yukon. Concept Richard Simmons starred as Sgt. Preston, and was supported by his dog Yukon King and horse Rex, now played by real animals. The dog cast as King was not a husky, however, but a large Alaskan Malamute. Charles Livingstone, who had worked on the radio version, directed several episodes. Though no plotlines seem to have been re-used from the radio show, they were generally built upon the same themes. Mainly filmed at Ashcroft, Colorado, the series was telecast on CBS from September 29, 1955, to September 25, 1958. Trendle-Campbell-Meurer produced the first two seasons, and the show aired in the same time slot as ABC's The Lone Ranger. In its last season, the Jack Wrather Corporation purchased the rights and produced Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Following a custom of the period, the show took its theme music from the classical repertoire, in this case the overture to Emil von Reznicek's comic opera Donna Diana. Comic book adaptation Don Sherwood adapted the series into a comic book series, with scripts by Stan Stunell. Sponsorship In 1955, the Quaker Oats company gave away land in the Klondike as part of the Klondike Big Inch Land Promotion which was tied in with the television show. Genuine deeds each to one square inch of a lot in Yukon Territory, issued by Klondike Big Inch Land Co. Inc., were inserted into Quaker's Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes.

History The facility was designed by Harvey Lonsdale Elmes and opened as the Third Lancashire County Lunatic Asylum on 1 January 1851. Additional wings designed by Henry Horner were completed in 1860. It became the County Lunatic Asylum, Rainhill in 1861. In 1877 a new annexe was designed by George Enoch Grayson and Edward Ould and constructed to the north-west of Rainhill Road. The annexe would later become known as the Avon Division. The Avon Division was designed to facilitate the accommodation of long-term, chronically mentally ill patients who were breaching capacity on what became known as the Sherdley Division which was subsequently mainly used for acute cases. The Avon Division was noted for its distinctive water towers and linear design. Some new buildings designed in a Tudor Revival style were added to the Avon Division in around 1900. The hospital was the location of the Great Porridge Strike on 6 April 1913 when the staff, members of the National Asylum Workers' Union, went on strike in protest when meat was replaced by oatmeal porridge. The facility became the County Mental Hospital, Rainhill in 1923 and at the peak of its activity, in the 1930s, there were approximately 3,000 inpatients resident at the hospital. From 1938 to 1949 the admissions part of the hospital served as a Royal Naval Auxiliary Hospital. From 1943 to 1944 the Medical Officer in Charge was Surgeon Captain Joseph Roland Brennan RN. The hospital joined the National Health Service as Rainhill Mental Hospital in 1948. Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, services transferred to Aintree Hospital and Whiston Hospital; the Avon Division closed in 1987 and the Sherdley Division closed in June 1992. The Scott Clinic, a medium secure facility, moved to new facilities on the Sherdley Division site. The site was initially acquired by Pilkington Glass for development of a new headquarters but instead Pilkington decided to sell off the site for residential use. The site has been developed and is now known as Reeve Court.

In 1922, Hooker bought the S. Wander & Sons company for the retail sales of lye and chlorinated lime. Hooker Chemical was best known for the chemical waste site Love Canal, which it sold in 1953, and which led to a lengthy lawsuit several decades later. History =Founding= The company was founded in 1903 as \\"the Development and Funding Company\\" by Elon Huntington Hooker, of Rochester, NY. Hooker created the company to utilize the Townsend cell to electrolyse salt into chlorine and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as \\"caustic soda\\" and \\"lye,\\" in a chloralkali process. Elmer Sperry, founder of Sperry Electric, and Leo Baekeland, inventor of Bakelite and Velox photographic paper, consulted for Hooker to improve the design of the cell. The company was sited in Niagara Falls, NY because of the low-cost electricity from the Niagara Falls power project (completed in 1895), the abundance of salt from nearby mines, and availability of water from the Niagara River. =First product lines= Chlorine, used for sanitation and the chlorination of drinking water, was sold as chlorinated lime. Chlorine products were produced, including chlorobenzene, which was then converted to picric acid, for use as an explosive in World War I. Later, solvents like trichloroethylene and phenol were sold for degreasing and dry cleaning by the subsidiary company Detrex. Hooker licensed his diaphragm cell technology to other chloralkali producers. In 1918, Hooker formed a company to hydrogenate vegetable oils. Hooker Chemical also began to produce sulfur chloride and sodium chlorate. In 1922, Hooker bought the S. Wander & Sons company for the retail sales of lye and chlorinated lime. Samual Wander had a retail store at 105 Hudson St, New York, NY and factories in Albany, NY. Hooker sold the business in 1927. Hooker built a new chlor-alkali plant in Tacoma, WA in 1929. Additional products, including sodium sulfide, sodium sulfhydrate, sodium tetrasulfide, and aluminum chloride were produced by the company. =World War II= In World War II, Hooker was a leading supplier of dodecyl mercaptan for the synthesis of rubber. The company also produced arsenic trichloride, thionyl chloride, and hexachlorobenzene. Hooker expanded into plastics manufacturing, developing epoxy vinyl ester resins, and in 1955 acquired a thermoset plastic phenolic resins business, called Durez Corp. =Selling= Hooker Chemical Company was purchased by Occidental Petroleum Corporation in 1968. Its name has changed a few times. =Documentary= The saga of Hooker Chemical Company in Montague, Michigan was documented by filmmaker David J. Ruck in 2002. The film This is Not a Chocolate Factory features the history of the site, its polluting practices and citizen response. The documentary film The Killing Ground features certain dumping sites of Hooker Chemical.

The surrounding the hospital cost ¬£. It was officially opened as the Radcliffe Asylum by Lady Elinor Denison on 24 July 1902. In 1913 extensions were made for 148 patients, which cost ¬£. It was used as a military hospital in the later stages of the First World War from August 1918 to October 1919, to care for shell shocked soldiers. Charlie Chaplin was briefly admitted to the hospital suffering from depression in 1920. It was the site of a strike and occupation in April 1922 when the staff, members of the National Asylum Workers' Union, went on strike in an attempt to resist a reduction in wages. In 1932, two further blocks were erected, each to accommodate 50 female patients. It became known as Saxondale Hospital in 1947 and joined the National Health Service in 1948. In 1955, two further villas were built, one to accommodate 36 females and the other 36 males. A woman alleged that Jimmy Savile lifted her skirt when she was at a disco at the hospital and then aged 14. She was a local resident rather than a patient. Savile had a fundraising association with Saxondale Hospital from 1972 to the early 1980s. The official report on the incident stated, \\"There was no reason to doubt that she gave an honest and truthful account of the incident as she recalled it.\\" The hospital closed in 1987 and was partly demolished prior to redevelopment of the site which is now a settlement known as Upper Saxondale.

The finished film, directed by William Westaway, was screened at venues on 27 June 2017 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of DeVore's fate and a 2018 television edit subsequently sold to Norway's VGTV and New Zealand's Rialto Channel. Means TV released it worldwide in 2020. An alternative 86 minute cut feature had premiered at Hot Docs as early as 2014 but was pulled from the festival circuit at the end of that year, heavily re-worked, and never distributed.  Background  On Friday 27 June 1997, Gary DeVore had been driving home after completing a new film script. He was last seen at a Denny's diner in the Mojave Desert around 1:00 on the morning of the 28th. The subsequent manhunt remained unsuccessful until July 1998 when an amateur detective located fragments of DeVore's car next to the California Aqueduct near Palmdale. The California Highway Patrol's investigation concluded that DeVore must have driven against oncoming traffic along the highway, crashed into the water and drowned in his vehicle. Production In an eponymous book and audiobook, Alford characterised the filmmaking process as highly erratic. Although he produced the 2014 version of the documentary, he was not similarly accredited on the final film. In 2016, director William Westaway raised ¬£4,769 through a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund completion of technical aspects to the production.

He holds the Yunus Chair in Social Business & Health and is Pro Vice Chancellor (Research) at Glasgow Caledonian University, the University for the Common Good. He is renowned for his research on measuring and valuing the benefits of health care, using economics in health care priority setting and economic evaluation. He has published over 250 refereed journal articles and seven books and, in almost 35 years in health economics research, Cam has won over ¬£25m in competitive funding awards, over ¬£10m of this as principal investigator.  Early life and education  Donaldson was born in Glasgow. His father was a trade union activist, working as a stereotyper at the Scottish Daily Express. His mother was a comptometer operator. He has two sisters and a brother. In the early 1970s, Express Newspapers moved his father's job to Manchester. Not having supported a football team in Scotland, and due to the famous Scottish footballer, Denis Law, finishing his career there, Donaldson picked Manchester City, and has remained a lifelong fan of the club. Having been educated at Bishopbriggs High School and Cheadle Moseley School for Boys, Donaldson went to study Economics at the University of Nottingham (1979‚Äì1982), immediately followed by a master's degree in Health Economics at the University of York. The interest in health came from wanting to apply economics to the public sector, and health, at the time, was a new and interesting area of exploration.  Career  Donaldson worked as a research fellow during the first year of the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) at the University of York. Here he met two of the three main collegial influences on his career ‚Äì Stephen Birch (now at McMaster University) and the late Alan Maynard (the first director of CHE). From York, Donaldson jumped into multidisciplinary environments in the (then) Health Care Research Unit at Newcastle University (1984‚Äì1988) and the Department of Public Health at the University of Sydney (his first Lectureship; 1989‚Äì1990). He then returned to Scotland to spend most of the 1990s as deputy director of the Health Economics Research Unit at the University of Aberdeen (1991‚Äì98). Initially, he deputised to part-time Director, Professor Gavin Mooney, one of the 'founding fathers' of health economics, who persuaded Donaldson to undertake a PhD under his supervision. He became a professor at Aberdeen in 1996 and, for five years of his tenure at Aberdeen, served as a national organiser of the Health Economists' Study Group (HESG), the UK body for health economics researchers. From 1998 to 2002, Donaldson worked as the Svare Chair in Health Economics at the University of Calgary. Here, he built a group of health economics researchers, holding an appointment there until 2011, visiting frequently. Whilst in Calgary he established the Health Economics Methods Group of the Cochrane Collaboration with Luke Vale (of the University of Aberdeen, now at Newcastle) and Miranda Mugford (University of East Anglia) and acted as co- convenor from 1998 to 2008. In 2001, the Health Foundation (a major charitable funder in the UK) announced a national competition for a chair in Health Economics. Any university applying had to team up with a named candidate. Donaldson's colleagues (particularly Professors John and Senga Bond) at Newcastle invited him to be their candidate, and together they won the funding of ¬£3m. What made Donaldson equally proud, however, was that three of the candidates who made it through to the final five were Ph.D. students of Mooney. At Newcastle, as well as building another significant group of health economists, Donaldson became the inaugural director of the Institute of Health and Society (from 2006 to 2010). There he worked closely with Professor Michael Jones-Lee and Rachel Baker, now Professor of Health Economics and director of the Yunus Centre for Social Business & Health at Glasgow Caledonian University, in translating Jones-Lee's work on valuing human life and safety into the health arena, leading major projects for the Department of Health in England and the European Commission. In 2010 he took up the Yunus Chair at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) where he established the Yunus Centre for Social Business and Health. He was intrigued by the mission (for the 'Common Weal') of this post-1992 university, and increasingly concerned that, despite world-class research at top universities and world-class health care provision in the National Health Service, health inequalities were not only persisting but growing. The idea of thinking about how non-health focused initiatives, such as social enterprise and fair credit, operating in the most deprived communities, could improve health through enhanced social cohesion, and working with Nobel Peace Laureate Muhammad Yunus on such issues, drew him back to Scotland. GCU's Yunus Centre has attracted international attention and substantial research funding since its inception, most notably from the UK's Research Councils, the Wellcome Trust and the National Institute for Health Research.  Contributions  = Using 'willingness to pay' to value the benefits of health care = Donaldson has pioneered this method in health, having developed novel approaches to quantifying values of patients and the public with respect to treatment options, demonstrating that: WTP can ‚Äòdetect‚Äô values of attributes of care beyond health gain (i.e. ‚Äòprocess utility‚Äô), and; distributional concerns (i.e. that WTP is associated with ability to pay) can be accommodated in applying the results of WTP studies to publicly funded health care settings. Cam also produced (with Jan Abel Olsen) the first-ever attempt to use WTP to establish relative priorities across health programmes, and has led major projects exploring the relationship between WTP and quality adjusted life years (QALYs).Jones, Andrew M. Elgar Handbook of Health Economics. Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 2012, p. 430. = Using economics in healthcare priority setting = Donaldson has led the development and use of an economic framework, known as programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA), in local (geographically defined) health care settings where funders are charged with meeting the needs of local populations from limited funding envelopes. This has involved working directly with decision-makers in several contexts at various levels of health care systems in the UK, Canada and New Zealand, working largely with Craig Mitton at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, using mainly qualitative research networks to document experiences. The main objective has been to adapt economics to complex management processes, so enhancing its uptake in decision-making and the framework has been used in several hundred health organisations globally. Related to this work, Donaldson acted as Honorary Secretary to the International Society on Priorities in Healthcare from 2006 to 2011, hosting the records and accounts of the society at Newcastle University. = Development and application of economic evaluation = Donaldson has acted as co-investigator on several economic evaluation projects over his career and has made important contributions to methods development in this area. Each has involved collaboration with health care researchers and professionals in several clinical settings. These evaluations have all created new knowledge in their respective clinical fields and have had various degrees of impact (e.g. feeding into NICE technology assessments), notably in nephrology, care of frail older people, osteoporosis screening, general surgery, sexual health and stroke. He's been a member of the National Institute for Health Care Excellence Appraisal Committee and chaired the Family Planning Association's Expert Panel on the Economics of Sexual Health in England, which reported in August 2005. With respect to methods of economic evaluation, he has co- produced two important papers in health economics criticising the foundations of QALYs and demonstrating that, as with WTP, QALYs are influenced by socio- economic status. = Creating the first Centre for Social Business and Health = Donaldson has been able to build a multidisciplinary team, combining expertise in health economics, finance, anthropology, sociology, social policy, political economy, history, public health, and statistics. In 2013 Donaldson managed to secure a major programme grant worth ¬£2 million over five years from the UK's Medical and Economic and Social Research Councils entitled 'Evidencing Social Enterprise as a Public Health Intervention'. The project commenced in January 2014. Other projects have followed, funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government's Health Directorate.  Awards  Donaldson has won several competitive personal awards for his research, such as: *Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, Senior Fellow (1998‚Äì2002); *Canadian Institutes for Health Research Senior Investigator (2000‚Äì2002); *Health Foundation Chair in Health Economics (2002‚Äì2010); *Economic and Social Research Council, Advanced Institute for Management Research, Public Services Fellow (2003‚Äì2004) *National Institute for Health Research, Inaugural Senior Investigator (2008‚Äì2012)  Personal life  Donaldson lives in Glasgow with his wife and partner (since 1992), Diane, who is a successful university administrator. They have two children (Graham and Callum Imray) and a grandson (Dominic).

The graphic novel was first published in 1982 under the title Le Transperceneige, and later retitled The Escape. The series was continued in two volumes by writer Benjamin Legrand, replacing Jacques Lob, with The Explorers published in 1999 and The Crossing in 2000. A fourth volume, Terminus, was written by Olivier Bocquet and published in 2015, as a conclusion to the series. An English translation was released in 2014 by Titan Comics, consisting of two volumes: Snowpiercer: The Escape and Snowpiercer: The Explorers (which also contains The Crossing). A third volume, Terminus, was released in 2016, followed by a prequel series in 2019. Plot =The Escape= After an environmental catastrophe induces an ice age, humanity occupies a 1,001-car train called the Snowpiercer. As the story begins, a man named Perloff is quarantined after escaping from the rearmost cars and is joined by a woman named Adeline Belleau: herself part of a movement to integrate the members of the back railway cars, who live in squalid conditions, into the rest of the train. Trying to rescue Perloff, Belleau is placed under quarantine with him. The two are eventually called to meet Colonel Krimson, passing through several different cars of the train. As they advance, Perloff and Belleau observe fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat, luxuries which they believed extinct. Krimson explains to Perloff and Belleau that the Snowpiercer has begun to slow down, and asks Perloff and Belleau's assistance in advancing the occupants of the rear of the train, to enable the rear cars' disconnection. Belleau and the members of her group agree, but Perloff learns that Krimson intends to disconnect the rear cars while his friends are aboard them. After warning Belleau's friends, Belleau and Perloff flee to the front of the train, pursued by the military. At the same time a virus, ostensibly spread by Perloff, is infecting others aboard the train, and the healthy advance to the front. Before reaching the engine of the Snowpiercer, Perloff breaks all the windows in the final car for unknown reasons. Belleau dies of the cold while Perloff is rescued by Alec Forrester, the engineer behind the Snowpiercer, who appoints him caretaker of 'Olga', the engine. As they are talking, the rear cars are disconnected. Perloff replaces Forrester as Olga's guardian but realizes that the virus has killed everyone else on board and that his own days are numbered as the train cannot run forever. =The Explorers= After losing contact with the Snowpiercer, those aboard a second train, Icebreaker, fear a collision. Several explorers are sent on a braking exercise, where they stop the train. Only one explorer returns alive, and soon disappears. Seventeen years later, Puig Vall√®s joins one of the now semi-regular braking exercises to avoid collision with the Snowpiercer. Puig disobeys orders during the braking exercise, so in retaliation he is falsely accused of murdering one of his fellow explorers. He is sentenced to fly a small plane on what is deemed a suicidal scouting mission. Puig flies ahead of the train and spots a downed bridge and warns the train, but the council want him dead and refuse to allow him to return and land his plane. Puig threatens to crash his plane into the train and derail it, while his lover Val broadcasts footage to everyone aboard the train. Their efforts force the council to spin the event such that Puig is now hailed as a hero for saving the train. It is then revealed to Puig that during the first braking exercise, the Icebreaker actually hit Snowpiercer, and its engine was brought aboard. The sole surviving explorer has since been tending to the engine along with Proloff, who only talks to the engine. The council maintains the myth that the Snowpiercer is out of control and still circling the world, to control the populace with fear. =The Crossing= The train detects a radio signal originating from across the frozen ocean. Puig decides to follow the radio music to its source, and it is revealed that the train can travel off the tracks by mounting caterpillars. Living standards deteriorate aboard the train, culminating in a failed but disastrous revolt where many people are killed, and numerous cars and resources are destroyed, making living conditions unsustainable. The train finally crosses the frozen ocean and reaches the source of the music, but the explorers are devastated to discover there are no people -- only an automated signal. =Terminus= With no more heat or food on the train, the passengers of the Icebreaker rebel and elect Laura Lewis as their new leader. Puig learns that Val is pregnant, and his explorers seek the source of the radio station's power. They discover the radio station is actually the top floor of a skyscraper and the ground floor is a train station. They turn on beacons which allow the Icebreaker to crash into the station, providing shelter but trapping and critically damaging the train in the process. Laura has Puig arrested, as she holds him responsible for the fateful decision to cross the ocean and the train's eventual destruction. While exploring the station, the passengers are seized by people wearing mice masks. The passengers are given food, but put in quarantine and inoculated for disease. The passengers are permitted to join the mice community, but are forced to be barcoded and blood-tested, and children and pregnant women are taken away for \\"special treatment.\\" Val uses a distraction to barcode herself and avoid a blood test, which would expose her pregnancy. It is revealed that the compound is a hybrid research laboratory and amusement park named Future Land. Its deranged founders, the \\"switchmen\\", have prolonged their life by using the stem cells of babies, and used the radio signal to lure all the other trains to them: There were ten perpetual trains, of which Icebreaker was the last of seven that successfully reached the station. It is further revealed that the switchmen have neutered all the mice and perform genetic experiments on fetuses and babies, in a misguided attempt to engineer a perfect human species. Laura betrays Val, who is taken to the switchmen. While this was happening, Puig escaped his captivity and recovered with the engineer's aid. Under disguise as a mouse, Puig uncovers that the nuclear plant which powers the compound is leaking and slowly killing the population. Puig reunites with Tom (the former radarist), Val and the other explorers, and together they free the children and animals that are held in captivity. They return to the Icebreaker, which the engineer has repaired, but are confronted by armed mice. Puig describes the situation and appeals to them to join him and the other passengers, and many of the mice defect. The story ends in the future: Hunters have just killed a killer whale, and as Puig dies of old age, a glimpse of flowers growing out of a patch of thawed earth is shown. =The Prequel= Part 1: Extinction This volume is set before the mass extinction event that caused the ice age. Part 2: Apocalypse This volume is set days after the extinction event. Part 3: Annihilation This volume is set a short time after the extinction event and after Part 2. Adaptations =Film= Korean director Bong Joon-ho adapted the graphic novel to the cinema as Snowpiercer, which was originally released in 2013. It was released the following year in the United States. =TV series= A Snowpiercer television series was developed with Josh Friedman writing and Bong as executive producer. In November 2016, TNT ordered a series pilot episode from Tomorrow Studios. In May 2017 it was reported that Daveed Diggs would star in the series and Scott Derrickson would direct the pilot and executive produce the series.. Derrickson filmed a feature-length pilot episode but refused to do the extreme reshoots requested by the new showrunner who wanted to take the show in a different direction.

Single-shot time traces for three different pump power levels (increasing from top to bottom) and corresponding histograms. Each time trace contains ~15,000 events. Rogue events reach intensities of at least 30‚Äì40 times the average value. Optical rogue waves are rare pulses of light analogous to rogue or freak ocean waves. The term optical rogue waves was coined to describe rare pulses of broadband light arising during the process of supercontinuum generation‚Äîa noise- sensitive nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input waveform‚Äîin nonlinear optical fiber. In this context, optical rogue waves are characterized by an anomalous surplus in energy at particular wavelengths (e.g., those shifted to the red of the input waveform) and/or an unexpected peak power. These anomalous events have been shown to follow heavy-tailed statistics, also known as L-shaped statistics, fat-tailed statistics, or extreme-value statistics. These probability distributions are characterized by long tails: large outliers occur rarely, yet much more frequently than expected from Gaussian statistics and intuition. Such distributions also describe the probabilities of freak ocean waves and various phenomena in both the man-made and natural worlds. Despite their infrequency, rare events wield significant influence in many systems. Aside from the statistical similarities, light waves traveling in optical fibers are known to obey the similar mathematics as water waves traveling in the open ocean (the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation), supporting the analogy between oceanic rogue waves and their optical counterparts. More generally, research has exposed a number of different analogies between extreme events in optics and hydrodynamic systems. A key practical difference is that most optical experiments can be done with a table-top apparatus, offer a high degree of experimental control, and allow data to be acquired extremely rapidly. Consequently, optical rogue waves are attractive for experimental and theoretical research and have become a highly studied phenomenon. The particulars of the analogy between extreme waves in optics and hydrodynamics may vary depending on the context, but the existence of rare events and extreme statistics in wave-related phenomena are common ground.  History  Optical rogue waves were initially reported in 2007 based on experiments investigating the stochastic properties of supercontinuum generation from a train of nearly-identical picosecond input pulses. In the experiments, radiation from a mode-locked laser (megahertz pulse train) was injected into a nonlinear optical fiber and characteristics of the output radiation were measured at the single-shot level for thousands of pulses (events). These measurements revealed that the attributes of individual pulses can be markedly different from those of the ensemble average. Consequently, these attributes are normally averaged out or hidden in time-averaged observations. The initial observations occurred at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of DARPA-funded research aiming to harness supercontinuum for time-stretch A/D conversion and other applications in which stable white light sources are required (e.g., real-time spectroscopy). The study of optical rogue waves ultimately showed that stimulated supercontinuum generation (as described further below) provides a means of becalming such broadband sources. Pulse- resolved spectral information was obtained by extracting wavelengths far from that of the input pulse using a longpass filter and detecting the filtered light with a photodiode and a real-time digital oscilloscope. The radiation can also be spectrally resolved with the time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (TS-DFT), which produces a wavelength-to-time mapping such that the temporal traces collected for each event correspond to the actual spectral profile over the filtered bandwidth. The TS-DFT has subsequently been used to stretch the complete (unfiltered) output spectra of such broadband pulses, thereby allowing measurement of full pulse-resolved spectra at the megahertz repetition rate of the source (see below). Pulse-resolved measurements showed that a fraction of the pulses had much more redshifted energy content than the majority of events. In other words, the energy passed by the filter was much larger for a small fraction of the events, and the fraction of events with anomalous energy content in this spectral band could be increased by raising the power of the input pulses. Histograms of this energy content showed heavy- tailed properties. In some scenarios, the vast majority of events had a negligible amount of energy within the filter bandwidth (i.e., below the measurement noise floor), while a small number of events had energies at least 30‚Äì40 times the average value, making them very clearly visible. The analogy between these extreme optical events and hydrodynamic rogue waves was initially developed by noting a number of parallels, including the role of solitons, heavy-tailed statistics, dispersion, modulation instability, and frequency downshifting effects. Additionally, forms of the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation are used to model both optical pulse propagation in nonlinear fiber and deep water waves, including hydrodynamic rogue waves. Simulations were then conducted with the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation in an effort to model the optical findings. For each trial or event, the initial conditions consisted of an input pulse and a minute amount of broadband input noise. The initial conditions (i.e., pulse power and noise level) were chosen so that the spectral broadening was relatively limited in the typical events. Collecting the results from the trials, very similar filtered energy statistics were observed compared with those seen experimentally. The simulations showed that rare events had experienced significantly more spectral broadening than the others because a soliton had been ejected in the former class of events, but not in the vast majority of events. By applying a correlation analysis between the redshifted output energy and the input noise, it was observed that a particular component of the input noise was elevated each time a surplus in the redshifted noise was generated. The critical noise component has specific frequency and timing relative to the pulse envelope‚Äîa noise component that efficiently seeds modulation instability and can, therefore, accelerate the onset of soliton fission.  Principles  = Supercontinuum generation with long pulses = Supercontinuum generation is a nonlinear process in which intense input light, usually pulsed, is broadened into a wideband spectrum. The broadening process can involve different pathways depending on the experimental conditions, yielding varying output properties. Especially large broadening factors can be realized by launching narrowband pump radiation (long pulses or continuous-wave radiation) into a nonlinear fiber at or near its zero-dispersion wavelength or in the anomalous dispersion regime. Such dispersive characteristics support modulation instability, which amplifies input noise and forms Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands around the pump wavelength. This amplification process, manifested in the time domain as a growing modulation on the envelope of the input pulse, then leads to the generation of high-order solitons, which break apart into fundamental solitons and coupled dispersive radiation. This process, known as soliton fission, occurs in supercontinuum generation pumped by both short or long pulses, but with ultrashort pulses, noise amplification is not a prerequisite for it to occur. These solitonic and dispersive fission products are redshifted and blueshifted, respectively, with respect to the pump wavelength. With further propagation, the solitons continue to shift to the red through the Raman self-frequency shift, an inelastic scattering process. = Fluctuations = Supercontinuum generation can be sensitive to noise. Especially with narrowband input radiation and large broadening factors, much of the spectral broadening is initiated by input noise, causing the spectral and temporal properties of the radiation to inherit substantial variability from shot-to-shot and to be highly sensitive to the initial conditions. These shot-to-shot variations normally go unnoticed in conventional measurements as they average over a very large number of pulses. Based on such time-averaged measurements, the spectral profile of the supercontinuum generally appears smooth and relatively featureless, whereas, the spectrum of a single pulse may be highly structured in comparison. Other effects such as dispersion management and polarization changes can also influence stability and bandwidth. Both the pump power and input noise level are influential in the supercontinuum generation process, determining, e.g., the broadening factor and the onset of soliton-fission. Below the threshold for soliton fission, the soliton number generated from an average output pulse is below one, and well above threshold, it can be quite large. In the case of large pump power, soliton fission often has been compared to onset of boiling in a superheated liquid in that the transition begins rather suddenly and explosively. In short, supercontinuum generation amplifies the input noise, transferring its properties to macroscopic characteristics of the broadened pulse train. Many of the commercially available supercontinuum sources are pumped by long pulses and, therefore, tend to have relatively significant pulse-to-pulse spectral fluctuations. Input noise, or any other stimulus, matching the timing of the sensitive portion of the pump envelope and the frequency shift of modulation instability gain experiences the largest amplification. The interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion creates a particular portion on the pump envelope where the modulation instability gain is large enough and the walk-off between the pump and growing modulation is not too rapid. The frequency of this sensitive window is generally substantially shifted from the input wavelength of the pump, especially if the pump is near the zero-dispersion wavelength of the fiber. Experimentally, the dominant source of such noise is typically amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from the laser itself or amplifiers used to increase the optical power. Once the growing modulation becomes large enough, soliton fission begins suddenly, liberating one or more redshifted solitons, which travel much slower than the remnants of the original envelope and continue shifting to the red due to Raman scattering. A properly positioned detection filter can be used to catch anomalous occurrences, such as a rare soliton that has been liberated due to a small surplus in the key input noise component. = Non-Gaussian statistics = Non-Gaussian statistics arise due to the nonlinear mapping of random initial conditions into output states. For example, modulation instability amplifies input noise, which ultimately leads to soliton formation. Also, in systems displaying heavy- tailed statistical properties, random input conditions often enter through a seemingly insignificant, nontrivial, or otherwise-hidden variable. Such is generally the case for optical rogue waves; for example, they can begin from a specific out-of-band noise component, which is usually very weak and unnoticed. Yet, in the output states, these minor input variations can be magnified into large potential swings in key observables. The latter may, therefore, exhibit substantial fluctuations for no readily apparent reason. Thus, the appearance of extreme statistics is often striking not only because of their counterintuitive probability assignments, but also because they frequently signify a nontrivial or unexpected sensitivity to initial conditions. It is important to recognize that rogue waves in both optics and hydrodynamics are classical phenomena and, therefore, intrinsically deterministic. However, determinism does not necessarily indicate that it is straightforward or practical to make useful predictions. Optical rogue waves and their statistical properties can be investigated in numerical simulations with the generalized nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, a classical propagation equation that is also used to model supercontinuum generation and, more generally, pulse propagation in optical fiber. In such simulations, a source of input noise is needed to produce the stochastic output variations. Frequently, input phase noise with a power amplitude of one photon per mode is employed, corresponding to shot noise. Yet, noise levels beyond the one- photon-per-mode level are generally more experimentally realistic and often needed. Measurements of redshifted energy serve as a means of detecting the presence of rare solitons. Additionally, peak intensity and redshifted energy are well correlated variables in supercontinuum generation with low soliton number; thus, redshifted energy serves as an indicator of peak intensity in this regime. This may be understood by recognizing that for sufficiently small soliton number only rare events contain a well-formed soliton. Such a soliton has short duration and high peak intensity, and Raman scattering ensures that it is also redshifted relative to the majority of the input radiation. Even if more than one soliton occurs in a single event, the most intense one generally has the most redshifted energy in this scenario. The solitons generally have little opportunity to interact with other intense features. As previously noted, the situation at higher pump power is different in that soliton fission occurs explosively; soliton structures appear in number at essentially the same point of the fiber and relatively early in the propagation, allowing collisions to occur. Such collisions are accompanied by an energy exchange facilitated by third-order dispersion and Raman effects, causing some solitons to absorb energy from others, thereby creating the potential for anomalous spectral redshifts. In this situation, the anomalous occurrences are not necessarily tied to the largest peak intensities. In summary, rare solitons may be generated at low pump power or input noise levels, and these events can be identified by their redshifted energy. At higher power, many solitons are generated and simulations suggest that their collisions can also yield extremes in redshifted energy, although in this case, the redshifted energy and peak intensity may not be as strongly correlated. Oceanic rogue waves are also thought to arise from both seeding of modulation instability and collisions between solitons, as in the optical scenario. Just above the soliton-fission threshold, where one or more solitons are liberated in a typical event, rare narrowband events are detected as deficiencies in redshifted energy. In this regime of operation, the pulse-resolved redshifted energy follows left-skewed heavy-tailed statistics. These rare narrowband events are not generally correlated with reductions in components of the input noise. Instead, a rare frustration of spectral broadening occurs because noise components can seed multiple presolitonic features; thus, the seeds can effectively compete for gain within the pump envelope, and therefore, the growth is suppressed. Under various operating conditions (pump power level, filter wavelength, etc.), a wide variety of statistical distributions are observed. = Other conditions = Supercontinuum sources driven by ultrashort pump pulses (on the order of tens of femtoseconds in duration or less) are generally much more stable than those pumped by longer pulses. Even though such supercontinuum sources may make use of anomalous or zero dispersion, the propagation lengths are usually short enough that noise-seeded modulation instability has a less significant impact. The broadband nature of the input radiation makes it such that octave-spanning supercontinua can be achieved with relatively modest broadening factors. Even so, the noise dynamics of such sources can still be nontrivial, though they are generally stable and can be suitable for precision time-resolved measurements and frequency metrology. Nevertheless, soliton timing jitter in supercontinuum generation with 100 fs pulses has also been traced to input noise amplification by modulation instability, and L-shaped statistics in filtered energy have been observed in supercontinuum sources driven by such pulses. Extreme statistics have also been observed with pumping in the normal dispersion regime, wherein modulation instability occurs due to the contribution of higher-order dispersion. = Turbulence and breathers = thumb|upright|Peregrine soliton in optics Wave turbulence or convective instability induced by third-order dispersion and/or Raman scattering have also been employed to describe the formation of optical rogue waves. Third-order dispersion and Raman scattering play a central role in the generation of large redshifts, and turbulence treats the statistical properties of weakly-coupled waves with randomized relative phases. Another theoretical description focused on analytical methodology has examined periodic nonlinear waves known as breathers. These structures provide a means of investigating modulation instability and are solitonic in nature. The Peregrine soliton, a specific breather solution, has attracted attention as a possible type of rogue wave that may have significance in optics and hydrodynamics, and this solution has been observed experimentally in both contexts. Yet, the stochastic nature of rogue waves in optics and hydrodynamics is one of their defining features, but remains an open question for these solutions as well as other postulated analytic forms. = Extreme events in beam filamentation = Extreme phenomena have been observed in single-shot studies of the temporal dynamics of optical beam filamentation in air and the two-dimensional transverse profiles of beams forming multiple filaments in a nonlinear Xenon cell. In the former studies, spectral analysis of self-guided optical filaments, which were generated with pulses close to the critical power for filamentation in air, showed that the shot-to-shot statistics become heavy-tailed at the short wavelength and long wavelength edges of the spectrum. Termed optical rogue wave statistics, this behavior was studied in simulations, which supported an explanation based on pump noise transfer by self-phase modulation. In the latter experimental study, filaments of extreme intensity described as optical rogue waves were observed to emerge due to mergers between filament strings when multiple filaments are generated. In contrast, the statistical properties were found to be approximately Gaussian for low filament numbers. It was noted that extreme spatio-temporal events are found only in certain nonlinear media even though other media have larger nonlinear responses, and the experimental findings suggested that laser-induced thermodynamic fluctuations within the nonlinear medium are the origin of the extreme events observed in multifilamention. Numerical predictions of extreme occurrences in multiple beam filamentation have also been performed, with some differences in conditions and interpretation.  Stimulated supercontinuum generation  Supercontinuum generation is generally unstable when pumped by long pulses. The occurrence of optical rogue waves are an extreme manifestation of this instability and arise due to a sensitivity to a particular component of input noise. This sensitivity can be exploited to stabilize and increase the generation efficiency of the spectral broadening process by actively seeding the instability with a controlled signal instead of allowing it to begin from noise. The seeding can be accomplished with an extraordinarily weak, tailored optical seed pulse, which stabilizes supercontinuum radiation by actively controlling or stimulating modulation instability. Whereas noise-induced (i.e., spontaneously generated) supercontinuum radiation usually has significant intensity noise and little to no pulse-to-pulse coherence, controlled stimulation results in a supercontinuum pulse train with greatly improved phase and amplitude stability. Additionally, the stimulus can also be used to actuate the broadband output, i.e., to switch the supercontinuum on and off by applying or blocking the seed. The seed may be derived from the pump pulse by broadening a portion of it slightly and then carving out a stable portion of the broadened tail. The relative delay between the pump and seed pulses is then adjusted accordingly, and the two pulses are combined in the nonlinear fiber. Alternatively, the extremely stable stimulated supercontinuum can be generated by deriving both pump and seed radiation from a parametric process, e.g., the two-color output (signal and idler) of an optical parametric oscillator. Added input modulations have also been studied for changing the frequency of rare events and optical feedback can be employed to speed up the spectral broadening process. Stimulated supercontinuum radiation can also be generated using an independent continuous-wave seed, which avoids the need to control the timing but the seed must instead must have higher average power. A continuous-wave-seeded supercontinuum source has been employed in time stretch microscopy, yielding improved images compared with those obtained using unseeded sources. Stimulated supercontinuum generation can be slowed or frustrated by applying a second seed pulse with the proper frequency and timing to the mix. Thus, applying one seed pulse can accelerate the spectral broadening process, and the application of a second seed pulse can once again delay spectral broadening. This frustration effect occurs because the two seeds effectively compete for gain within the pump envelope, and it is a controlled version of the rare narrowband events known to occur stochastically in certain supercontinuum pulse trains (see above). Stimulation has been harnessed for enhancing silicon-based supercontinuum generation at telecommunications wavelengths. Normally, spectral broadening in silicon is self-limiting because of strong nonlinear absorption effects: two-photon absorption and the associated free-carrier generation rapidly sap the pump, and increasing the pump power leads to more rapid depletion. In silicon nanowires, stimulated supercontinuum generation can greatly extend the broadening factor by circumventing the clamping effect of nonlinear loss, make broadening much more efficient, and yield coherent output radiation with the proper seed radiation.  Pulse-resolved spectra  Complete single-shot spectral profiles of modulation instability and supercontinuum have been mapped into the time domain with the TS-DFT for capture at megahertz repetition rates. These experiments have been used to collect large volumes of spectra data very rapidly, permitting detailed statistical analyses of the underlying dynamics in ways that are exceedingly difficult or impossible to achieve with standard measurement techniques. Latent intrapulse correlations have been identified in modulation instability and supercontinuum spectra through such experiments. In particular, spectral measurements with the TS-DFT have been employed to reveal a number of key aspects of modulation instability in the pulsed (i.e., temporally-confined) scenario. Experimental data show that modulation instability amplifies discrete spectral modes, which exhibit mode asymmetry between Stokes and anti-Stokes wavelengths. Furthermore, the dynamics display prominent competition effects between these amplified modes, an interaction that favors domination of one mode over others. Such TS-DFT measurements have provided insights into the mechanism that often causes single patterns to dominate a given spatial or temporal region in the various contexts in which modulation instability appears. This type of exclusive mode growth is also influential in the initiation of optical rogue waves. Optically, these features become apparent in single-shot studies of pulse- driven modulation instability, but such effects are normally unrecognizable in time-averaged measurements due to inhomogeneous broadening of the modulation instability gain profile. The acquisition of a large number of such single- shot spectra also has a critical role in these analyses. This measurement technique has been used to measure supercontinuum spectra spanning an octave in bandwidth, and in such broadband measurements, rare rogue solitons have been observed at redshifted wavelengths. Single-shot spectral measurements with the TS-DFT have also recorded rogue-wave-like probability distributions caused by cascaded Raman dynamics in the process of intracavity Raman conversion in a partially mode-locked fiber laser.

Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent Luitpold of Bavaria founded the Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur F√∂rderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in M√ºnchen, an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional history painting in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the Academy of Fine Arts, but was firmly opposed to impressionism, expressionism, symbolism and other contemporary trends in the art world. Another factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the Glaspalast, organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.Rita Hummel: Die Anf√§nge der M√ºnchener Secession. Schriften aus dem Institut f√ºr Kunstgeschichte der Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Vol. 46, . Tuduv-Verlags- Gesellschaft, M√ºnchen 1989, . (based on a thesis for the University of Munich). To address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public. In this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.Clelia Segieth: Memorandum des Vereins Bildender K√ºnstler M√ºnchens. In: Buhrs, Best: Secession 1892‚Äì1914, S. 20‚Äì24.  Foundation  Bruno Piglhein, first President of the Secession On April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the Association of Visual Artists of Munich. Bruno Piglhein was elected the first President and Paul Hoecker became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: Munich Secession. Financial support initially came from three sources: Georg Hirth, a writer and journalist who coined the word \\"secession\\" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the Art-Nouveau magazine Jugend ; Georg von Vollmar, editor of the Democratic Socialist party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies. That same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the ', composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The Vienna Secession followed five years later, and the Berlin Secession was established in 1898.  Exhibitions  The National Exhibition Building (ULAP), c.1885 At first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 Gold Marks, if the group would move there permanently.Helmut K√§stl: Historisches zur M√ºnchener Secession. In: muenchenersecession.de, abgerufen am 22. Juni 2012. Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's \\"National Exhibition Building\\" (now known as \\"ULAP\\") early in 1893. Baurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of Prinzregentenstra√üe and Pilotystra√üe. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists. The success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the K√∂nigsplatz (now the Staatliche Antikensammlungen) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.  Later history  In 1933, the National Socialist party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as Gleichschaltung (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered \\"degenerate\\" were not allowed to paint.Hermann Glaser: Wie Hitler den deutschen Geist zerst√∂rte. Kulturpolitik im Dritten Reich. Ellert & Richter, Hamburg 2005, . In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the \\"Kulturellen S√§uberung\\" (cultural cleansing) process. Following the end of World War II in 1946, the ' and the Neue M√ºnchner K√ºnstlergenossenschaft (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the Bundesverband Bildender K√ºnstlerinnen und K√ºnstler (Federal Association of Visual Artists). In 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the \\"Secessionsgalerie\\" and promote exhibitions.

It follows Stan, who rigs a school election to make his son Steve popular; but he becomes drunk with power and ends up going crazy. The episode was written by series co- creators Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman. The episode features a guest appearance by Carmen Electra. Seth MacFarlane, who is best known for creating Family Guy, stated that he and Weitzman came up with the series after the 2000 United States presidential election. Initially, the series was to replace Family Guy after its cancellation but it was revived after the pilot episode aired. Because of this, MacFarlane left the show and handed creative control over to Barker and Weitzman. After the pilot aired, the rest of the first season began on May 1, 2005, on Fox's Animation Domination lineup which had its debut on that date. The pilot received mixed reviews from critics and fans; with many people calling American Dad! a rip off of Family Guy. Despite the mixed reviews, it was a ratings success. According to the Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 15.10 million people in the United States, and required a 7.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic.  Plot  Steve is upset about his lack of popularity. He notices that girls seem attracted to guys with dogs, so he asks his parents for one. Stan gets Steve a 19-year-old dog, because it was alive during the Reagan administration. One night, Roger the Alien makes a noise and Stan goes downstairs, thinking it is an intruder. Stan shoots the intruder, only to find out that he just accidentally killed Steve's dog. They bury the dog, and Stan tries to make up for it by rigging the school election and discrediting his opponent by showing an altered photo of her in bed with the Jack in the Box Man (who Stan tells Steve, and Roger later discovers, is still in their basement) so that Steve wins and becomes the school president. Once elected, Steve uses his attribution as student body president to impress the head cheerleader, Lisa Silver, turn the lockers into edible chocolate ones, and changes the word \\"period\\" to Steve. He soon gets drunk with power, but believes that he is succeeding, until Lisa dumps him when he first tries to kiss her. Steve goes crazy and holds the school hostage. Stan sneaks into the school and gets Steve to stop by revealing that he was unpopular in high school as well. On another front, the audience is introduced to Roger, an alien who saved Stan's life in Area 51. As repayment, Roger lives with the Smiths, but his presence is not known by the CIA, Stan's employer, and the world. Since Stan fears that the CIA would erase his and Roger's memories if the alien were ever discovered, Roger is forced to live in confinement at the Smith's. Roger is also addicted to sugar, and Francine puts him on a forced diet when his weight causes him to break a chair and the dinner table. In order to get around Francine's strict control of junk food in the house, Roger strikes a deal with Hayley to do her homework in exchange for her smuggling sweets to him. It works at first, but on the night before the deadline for one of Hayley's papers on Henry Kissinger, Roger has too much sugar and passes out without doing the work. He and Hayley are able to come up with an excuse to make her teacher give her an extension on the paper's deadline (they dig up Steve's dead dog and Hayley tells the teacher that she just lost her dog). After this scare, however, Hayley decides to discontinue her agreement with Roger. Roger, noticing Steve's frustration in getting a girl, becomes his adviser for dating, in exchange for a \\"buttload\\" of Twinkies. Roger also reveals that every seven hours an ooze shoots out of his body, \\"like clockwork\\".  Background and production  In 1999, Family Guy, MacFarlane's first animated show, aired on Fox to ratings success. During this time, MacFarlane came up with the idea for American Dad! after the 2000 presidential election; stating \\"me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable.\\" Later, series co-creator Mike Barker stated, \\"About a year and a half ago, Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter. It was right up our alley, and everything just fell into place.\\" On September 14, 2003, Variety reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a pilot presentation of the then tentatively titled American Dad! and \\"If greenlit, American Dad! could launch as early as fall 2004.\\" At the time, Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms. The original American Dad! pilot was a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker, and Weitzman to sell American Dad! to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series. Fox green- lit the show and announced that it would air after Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005. While American Dad! was being pitched to Fox, the network canceled Family Guy in 2003, and Fox planned on marketing American Dad! as a replacement for Family Guy. However, in 2005, Family Guy was revived due to high re-run ratings and DVD sales. As a result, MacFarlane chose to focus on Family Guy and handed creative control of American Dad! to Barker and Weitzman.  Cultural references  Steve's Shazam! shirt is a reference to the TV show of the same name. The old Algebra teacher's name is Mr. Feeney; which is a reference to the show \\"Boy Meets World\\", in which the teacher that seemed to always teach the kids was named Mr. Feeney. The school is named after Pearl Bailey, as Bailey was an actress and singer, who won a Tony Award for playing Dolly Levi in Hello, Dolly!.  Reception  The pilot episode received mixed reviews from critics. In a review of American Dad! Volume 1 DVD, Michael Drucker of IGN stated that it's \\"occasionally weighed down with its topical humor. Characters are extremely polarized, especially Stan and Hayley, and the constant flow of jokes about their politics can become tiring.\\" The New York Times's Alessandra Stanley said the show \\"aspires to pick up where 'The Simpsons' and 'South Park' left off, but many of its jokes and cultural references seem off. \\" Robert Bianco of USA Today said \\"If you like Family Guy, you'll probably like American Dad. The problem is, if you've seen Family Guy, you've already seen American Dad.\\" In a negative review, Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said \\"The jokes aren't funny, the story is silly (or, really, not silly enough) and the new writers follow the \\"Family Guy\\" model so closely they fail to explain any of the characters or even the premise of the show.\\" According to the Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 15.10 million people in the United States, and required a 7.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic.

During the war she served primarily as a convoy escort. She was named for Outremont, Quebec. Outremont was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 18 November 1942 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 3 July 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 27 November 1943 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in St. Margaret's Bay, Outremont was assigned to escort group EG 6 based out of Derry. Upon arrival she performed local escort and anti- submarine duties in United Kingdom waters. She was present on D-day as part of Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Invasion of Normandy. Her task as part of EG 6 was to protect the invasion fleet from attack by submarine. On 10 June, while escorting the aircraft carrier , was severely damaged in a collision with the escort carrier and Outremont took the crippled ship in tow. Outremont returned to Canada in December 1944 to undergo a tropicalization refit at Sydney in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. She returned to service on 20 August 1945 only to be paid off 5 November. =Postwar service= Outremont was sold to Marine Industries after the war. She was later repurchased by the Royal Canadian Navy for conversion to a Prestonian-class frigate. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She was recommissioned on 2 September 1955 at Saint John with the pennant 310. Her crew came from sister ship , which had been paid off the same day. Outremont deployed to the Caribbean Sea in May‚ÄìJune 1956 for training exercises with the destroyer and two United States Navy submarines. She served in a training capacity with the Seventh Canadian Escort Squadron. In June 1960, the frigate began a tour of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway, making several port visits. She was paid off on 7 June 1965. She was sold for scrap and broken up at La Spezia, Italy in 1966. References =Notes= =Sources= Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

He made his professional debut in January 2009. He has both a sandanme and a j≈´ry≈ç division championship. He reached the j≈´ry≈ç division in July 2012 and the top makuuchi division for the first time in January 2014. He was the only wrestler recruited by former yokozuna Takanohana to reach the elite sekitori ranks. He was runner-up in one top division tournament and earned two special prizes, one for Fighting Spirit and one for Outstanding Performance. His highest rank was maegashira 2. Takanoiwa was the victim of an assault by sumo wrestler Harumafuji in October 2017. Takanoiwa was then the assailant in an incident against a junior member of his own stable the following year, which led to his retirement from the sport. Early life and sumo background Baasandorj passed a selective test administered by a Japanese coach from Johoku High School in Shimane Prefecture, who had come to Mongolia looking for sumo prospects. He was then invited to come to Japan as an exchange student on a sumo program at the age of sixteen. Only three months after coming to Japan, his father died of liver disease in Mongolia. He had already lost his mother to heart disease when he was eight years old. Through this adversity, he still managed to excel, and in 2007 made the best four in the individual category at a national junior sumo competition and in 2008 finished second in the middle- weight category at the World Junior Sumo Championships held in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Career In November 2008 he joined Takanohana stable, run by former yokozuna Takanohana who he had idolized since a young age. The ring name he would choose is purported to have come from a chance meeting with singer and author Akihiro Miwa in Haneda airport, as he was being accompanied by Takanohana from Shimane prefecture to his new stable. Upon meeting him, Miwa described him a \\"like a rock\\" (Â≤© iwa). This left an impression on him and that very evening he consulted with his stablemaster and together they conceived of the ring name of Takanoiwa (noble rock), the taka (Ë≤¥) coming from his stablemaster's ring name (as is the custom at the stable). His debut was delayed one tournament while his visa was procured, and he debuted in maezum≈ç in the January 2009 tournament along with fellow recruits Takagepp≈ç and Takatoshi. Proceeding him were graduates from Johoku High School (well known for its strong sumo program) Takarafuji, Kimikaze and Tokush≈çry≈´. He official debut was in the following March 2009 tournament where he managed a strong 5‚Äì2 record in the jonokuchi division. In the May 2009 tournament in the jonidan division, he would vie for the championship, logging a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and only losing on the final day in a play-off. After two winning tournaments in the sandanme division, in the November 2009 he took the championship in that division with a 7‚Äì0 record and playoff win. This allowed him promotion to the makushita third division, but he struggled in this division for an over a year, rarely achieving a winning tournament and in the midway through the May 2011 tournament he dropped out and also missed the following tournament. He was relegated back to sandanme but was not deterred and posted a 6‚Äì1 record his first tournament back which allowed him to be promoted back to makushita the very next tournament where he achieved a 6‚Äì1 record and participated in a three-man playoff for the championship, losing the second playoff match to future sekitori Chiyo≈çtori. His fortunes continued to improve and after four winning tournaments at makushita he was promoted to the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç for the first time for the July 2012 tournament. After recording a winning 8‚Äì7 record, he had managed only two 7‚Äì8 tournaments after this. However, at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 13, a rank low enough to face possible relegation if he did not perform well, he turned his fortunes around and took the championship in j≈´ry≈ç with a 12‚Äì3 record. After another five tournaments, achieving mostly winning records in j≈´ry≈ç he was finally promoted to the top tier makuuchi division for the January 2014 tournament. Over the next two years Takanoiwa moved back and forth between the top two divisions. He was relegated after the May tournament but returned immediately after recording twelve wins in July. After two losing records he dropped back to j≈´ry≈ç but was promoted again after the March 2015 tournament. He again lasted only two tournaments before being relegated but was promoted for the fourth time after a kachi-koshi or winning record in November 2015. In January and March 2016 he achieved back-to-back winning records for the first time in the top division. In July he had his best performance to date in the top division, scoring 12‚Äì3 and finishing runner-up to Harumafuji. He was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit, and won promotion to his highest rank to date of maegashira 3 for the September 2016 tournament. Losing records in the last two tournaments of 2016 saw him drop to maegashira 10 but he returned to form in January 2017. After compiling a 10‚Äì3 record he earned his first kinboshi on day 14 with force out (yorikiri) win over Hakuh≈ç. Despite losing to Sokokurai on the final day he finished in a tie for third place and was awarded the special prize for Outstanding Performance. He was promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 2 for the Haru tournament in March. He withdrew from the May 2017 tournament on the 12th day due to a thigh injury. =Assault= He was injured during the Tottori stage of the regional tour in October 2017, and was hospitalized from November 5 to November 9 in Fukuoka, reportedly with concussion and a fractured skull among other ailments. He withdrew from the November 2017 tournament as a result. On November 14 it was reported that he had been assaulted with a beer bottle (later said to be a karaoke remote control) by yokozuna Harumafuji. Harumafuji withdrew from the November tournament on the same day and did not deny the reports, saying \\"I sincerely apologize for causing trouble.\\" It later emerged that Takanoiwa's injuries were not as severe as first reported, with a doctor at the Fukuoka hospital who wrote the initial medical certificate submitted to the Japan Sumo Association by stablemaster Takanohana saying that there were no symptoms of skull fracture or brain fluid leakage, and that the \\"two weeks of recovery time\\" mentioned in the certificate should have started from the date of the incident in late October, not when the certificate was issued on November 9, meaning that Takanoiwa was cleared to enter the tournament. Takanoiwa was questioned by Tottori prefectural police as part of their enquiry into the incident, which is alleged to have been sparked off by Takanoiwa disrespecting yokozuna Hakuh≈ç by telling him that \\"your era is over\\" and playing with his cell phone while he was being reprimanded for his bad attitude. He did not take part in the regional tour in December, despite his stablemaster not submitting a new medical certificate. He finally spoke to the Sumo Association's crisis committee investigating the affair on December 19, and said that he had not done anything discourteous that would warrant being struck by Harumafuji. He also said that he was embarrassed about being hit in front of officials from Tottori Johoku High School, which Takanoiwa attended and whose graduates were being celebrated when the incident occurred. He added that he had not wanted Harumafuji to retire. He fell to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the January 2018 tournament, but Hakkaku Oyakata, chairman of the Sumo Association, said Takanoiwa would not be demoted further if he provided a medical certificate and would still be ranked in j≈´ry≈ç for March 2018 even were he to be absent from the January tournament. Takaniowa officially withdrew from the tournament on January 12. Takanoiwa made his first public appearance since the scandal at a training event on March 1, where he said he was gradually returning to fitness. He entered the March 2018 tournament and earned an 8‚Äì7 record in the j≈´ry≈ç division. He won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship in July 2018 with a 13‚Äì2 record and a playoff win over Takanosho to ensure his return to the top division after a year's absence. On October 4, 2018 Takanoiwa filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District Court seeking 24 million yen in damages from Harumafuji, after negotiations over an informal settlement broke down. He withdrew the suit on October 30, saying his family had suffered abuse over the legal action because of Harumafuji's continued popularity in Mongolia. =Return to Makuuchi= In his first tournament back in the top division Takanoiwa scored ten wins and five losses. After this tournament his stablemaster Takanohana resigned from the Sumo Association and Takanoiwa moved with his fellow Takanohana stable wrestlers to the Chiganoura stable. In his first (and only) tournament for his new stable in November 2018, he scored 6‚Äì9. =Retirement= On 5 December 2018 the Japan Sumo Association announced that Takanoiwa had assaulted one of his personal attendants, or tsukebito, during a regional tour, giving him a swollen face. Two days after this announcement, the Sumo Association accepted Takanoiwa's resignation from the sport. At a press conference, Takanoiwa said that he caused \\"anguish\\" and that he would take responsibility for the incident by retiring. He had a danpatsu- shiki or retirement ceremony at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on February 2, 2019, although it was not an official Sumo Association event. Hakuh≈ç, Kakury≈´ and Harumafuji attended, although Takanohana did not. Fighting style Takanoiwa was a yotsu-sumo wrestler who preferred grappling techniques to pushing and thrusting. His favoured grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt was migi-yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position. He regularly used his left hand outer grip to win by uwatenage, or overarm throw, but his most common winning kimarite was a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out.

They received international attention for their brand of \\"modern psychedelia\\", and for generating the \\"Arizona sound.\\" Influenced by The Chocolate Watchband, The Doors, The Beatles, The Byrds, Fuzztones, early Miracle Workers, Strawberry Alarm Clock, The Electric Prunes, 1960's garage/psychedelic music, their sound incorporates traditional fuzz with elements associated with these other genres, such as the use of the Farfisa organ and 12-string Rickenbacker guitars, re-created without clich√©d regurgitation. Subsequent releases on Skyclad/Get Hip Records and two European labels, Music Maniac (Germany) and Psych-Out (France), and an international tour, earned them a fan base in Europe as well as the US. Their music videos received airplay on more than 50 video shows on the top cable channels in the 1980s. MTV's \\"120 Minutes\\" aired the music videos for the songs \\"Suddenly Sunday\\" and \\"Thirteen Ghosts.\\" SuperStation WTBS also aired the music video \\"Suddenly Sunday\\" on their show \\"Night Tracks\\". For a brief time, between 1991‚Äì1993, the band shortened their name to \\"Overcoat.\\" The band stopped touring in 1996, but re-formed in 2000 to record through 2011. Although the band played its last concert in 2008, many contemporary garage bands have cited The Marshmallow Overcoat as a chief influence. In addition to nine full- length album releases, singles and vinyl EPs, The Marshmallow Overcoat appear on compilation albums released in the US, UK, Italy, France, Spain, Greece and Germany. Their recordings have received airplay on radio stations in the US and abroad. In 2013, Timothy Gassen ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to release a 30-song \\"best of\\" audio collection as a 2-LP colored vinyl set.* The band's name, The Marshmallow Overcoat, was inspired by dialog in Martin Scorsese's 1978 film The Last Waltz.

Background A son of Elisha P. Bolton and the former Eliza Burbridge, Bolton was born in DeKalb County, Georgia, in what became part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. When he was sixteen, the family relocated to the Shiloh community in Union Parish, north of Ruston, Louisiana. Bolton was educated in his father's private school. In 1861, Bolton enlisted in the Confederate Army, in which he attained the rank of sergeant in Company E of the 12th Louisiana Infantry. He served throughout the American Civil War.A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography based part of the information on the Bolton sketch from Alc√©e Fortier, Louisiana, III (1914). After the war Bolton taught school for a year in Union Parish but soon pursued the mercantile business, first in Winnfield. In 1868, he married Tennessee Wade (May 16, 1850 - July 10, 1931), a native Arkansan and the daughter of his business partner, Dr. A. Wade. The couple had ten children, at least three of whom died in early childhood: James Wade, George G., Frank P., James Porter, Roscoe Conkling, Bertha Bolton Hall (1889-1944), Ida Ruth Bolton Roach (1876-1906), Lotta T. (1874-1876), Albert (1881-1882), and George W. Jr. (1885-1889) Diversified career In 1869, Bolton moved the business to Pineville on the eastern side of the Red River across from the larger Alexandria, the seat of government of Rapides Parish. The business in Pineville closed in 1900. Active in political and civic affairs, Bolton was a delegate to state constitutional conventions in 1879 and 1898. In 1888, he was elected as a Democrat to the first of two terms in the Louisiana House of Representatives. The governor at the time was Democrat Francis T. Nicholls. In Bolton's second term under Governor Murphy J. Foster Sr., he was elected the House Speaker. In 1888, Bolton organized the Rapides Bank and Trust Company, since merged into Bank One Corporation. His son James Wade Bolton and grandsons James Calderwood Bolton and Robert H. Bolton continued to run the bank throughout the twentieth century. He stepped down as the bank president in 1912 but remained chairman of the board until his death nineteen years later. In 1900, he was elected the first president of the newly organized Louisiana Bankers Association. He was a member of the executive council of the American Bankers Association. He was a member of the elected Rapides Parish School Board. He was a delegate the 1904 Democratic National Convention, which nominated Judge Alton B.

He was the president of the company that built the former bridge over the Red River at Murray Street in Alexandria. Bolton was the first president of the executive board of the Alexandria-based Louisiana Baptist Convention and an organizer of the large Emmanuel Baptist Church in downtown Alexandria. His family in subsequent generations continued to support Emmanuel Church. He was an officer of the Masonic lodge. Bolton Avenue, a major thoroughfare west of downtown Alexandria, is named in his honor. Upon his death some six weeks before his ninetieth birthday, Bolton was interred beside his wife at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pineville. She had died only twenty-three days prior to his passing.

Southern Bldg. Code Congress Int'l, Inc., 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc), was a 2002 en banc 9-6 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, about the scope of copyright protection for building codes and by implication other privately drafted laws adopted by states and municipal governments.Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int'l, Inc., 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 969 (2003). A three-fifths majority of the court's fifteen judges held that copyright protection no longer applied to model codes once they were enacted into law. Background =Factual context= The Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) published a standard building code that it proposed as a model code for municipalities. It encourages local government entities to enact its codes into law by reference, without cost to them. The towns of Anna and Savoy in North Texas adopted the SBCCI code as law. Peter Veeck operates a website that provides free access via the Internet to information about the area of Texas north of Dallas, including some of the area's municipal codes and ordinances. He learned that Anna and Savoy had adopted the SBCCI code and went to those towns to obtain copies of the code, but was unsuccessful.The brief of the United States, filed after the Supreme Court called for the views of the Solicitor General on the petition for a writ of certiorari, stated: \\"The standard codes are generally available to the public at local government offices and libraries, although neither Savoy nor Anna has a public library and there is reason to believe that finding copies of the codes may be difficult.\\" Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Southern Bldg. Code Cong. Int'l, Inc. v. Veeck (2003) (No. 02-355), at 3. Veek was also unsuccessful in obtaining the codes of another 20 Texas towns. Id. He then bought electronic copies of the codes from SBCCI. Despite the fact that the codes contained a copyright notice and warnings against copying, Veeck uploaded the codes on his website. SBCCI demanded that Veeck cease and desist from infringing its copyrights. In response, Veeck filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that he did not violate the Copyright Act. SBCCI counterclaimed for copyright infringement and other allegedly wrongful acts.293 F.3d at 793-94, 809-10. =District court ruling= The facts were not disputed and each party moved for summary judgment on the copyright infringement issue. The district court granted summary judgment in SBCCI's favor.Veeck v. Southern Bldg. Code Congress Int'l, Inc., 49 F. Supp. 2d 885 (E.D. Tex., 1999). The district court began by considering the Supreme Court's 1888 decision in Banks v. Manchester,128 U.S. 244 (1888). which held that judicial opinions are not subject to copyright protection. Banks in turn rests upon two grounds neither of which, the district court said, would justify invalidation of SBCCI's copyright protection: # the public owns the opinions because it pays the judge's salaries, and # as a matter of public policy, the whole work done by the judges constitutes the \\"authentic exposition and interpretation of the law,\\" which, binds every citizen and therefore \\"is free for publication to all.\\"49 F. Supp. 2d at 888. These considerations do not apply here, the district court maintained, because \\"SBCCI is a private non- profit corporation which carries out research, compiles data, drafts standardized codes, and then prints them in a usable fashion for its customers,\\" without payment from the public. Without copyright protection, organizations like SDCCI would be unable to continue their work. While Veeck argues that it is necessary to publish codes on the Internet to provide the public with its due process right to free access to the law, he is wrong. The fact that he purchased the codes by just ordering and paying for them shows that the public can do the same. Therefore, the court said, \\"Banks is clearly distinguishable to the present case or scenario as stated above. Accordingly, the Court finds that SBCCI's works should be afforded their copyright protection.\\"49 F. Supp. 2d at 889. The district court entered a permanent injunction and ordered an award of monetary damages.293 F.3d at 794. An appeal followed. =The vacated panel decision= Initially, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed, but its decision was vacated and the case was set for rehearing en banc. The panel concluded (a) the incentive of copyright was needed to continue production of these useful model codes; (b) there was no evidence that Veeck had been denied access to the town building codes; and (c) there was no merger of idea and expression because \\"contrary to Veeck's insistence‚Äîthere remain many ways to write model building codes, not just one.\\"241 F.3d 398, 402-04, 407 (5th Cir. 2001), rev'd, 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002). Ruling of the Fifth Circuit =Majority opinion= Judge Edith Jones began her opinion for the nine-judge majority with this summary: > The issue in this en banc case is the extent to which a private organization > may assert copyright protection for its model codes, after the models have > been adopted by a legislative body and become \\"the law\\". Specifically, may a > code-writing organization prevent a website operator from posting the text > of a model code where the code is identified simply as the building code of > a city that enacted the model code as law? Our short answer is that as law, > the model codes enter the public domain and are not subject to the copyright > holder's exclusive prerogatives.293 F.3d at 793. The law is excluded from copyright The court traced the early case law. In 1834, the Supreme Court interpreted the first federal copyright laws and unanimously held that \\"no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court ...\\"Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 668 (1834). The case involved a copyright infringement suit between early reporters of U.S. Supreme Court opinions, both of whom were selling editions of their reports. Peters, who had replaced Wheaton, the reporter from 1816 to 1827, decided to market a less expensive product in which he omitted Wheaton's annotations and summaries but copied the texts of the Supreme Court's opinions, both those preceding his term as reporter and those he reported himself. Wheaton found his market dried up and sued Peters for infringement. Wheaton lost in the trial court and appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment. The Court's opinion concluded: \\"It may be proper to remark that the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right.\\"Wheaton, 33 U.S. at 668. Thus, any copyright protection for publications of judicial opinions could cover only the added materials such as summaries of the opinions and commentaries on them, but not the judicially authored texts of the opinions themselves. Counsel for both parties in the case agreed that statutes could not be copyrighted.Veeck, 293 F.3d at 795. In 1888, the Supreme Court extended the rule of Wheaton v. Peters to state court opinions, saying that the law \\" is free for publication to all.\\"Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244 (1888). State courts made similar rulings for their courts and laws.Veeck, 293 F.3d at 796. SBCCI argues that the Banks case explains the rule on two grounds, both of which (SBCCI argues) are inapplicable here. First, Banks is said to deny copyright to judicial opinions because judges, whose salaries are paid by the government, cannot claim to own the opinions. Also, they do not need copyright incentives to write opinions. In contrast, SBCCI is unlike government employees, it says, and as the private \\"author\\" of model codes it allegedly depends on copyright incentives in order to perform their public service. Second, SBCCI argues that Banks in effect says that due process requires adequate public access to the law, but that argument does not apply because there is adequate public access to its building codes.293 F.3d at 796‚Äì97. The court disagreed that this is a proper reading of Banks. Rather, \\"Banks declares at the outset of its discussion that copyright law in the United States is purely a matter of statutory construction.\\"See Banks, 128 U.S. at 251. Then the Supreme Court denies that judges are the authors or proprietors of their opinions. What their work is \\" constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which, binding every citizen, is free for publication to all.\\"See Banks, 128 U.S. at 253‚Äì54. In effect, judicial writings are works for hire that belong to the public that pays judges' salaries.293 F.3d at 797. The Fifth Circuit insisted that \\"Banks refers to the source of the judges' salary in order to explain that it is the public at large, not the judges, who have the pecuniary interest or proprietorship in the fruits of their judicial labors.\\" Id. Banks, read together with Wheaton, on which it relies, stands for the rule that the law \\"is not subject to copyright.\\"293 F.3d at 798. The law is not simply what a law-proposing body such as SBCCI offers to the legislature: > Lawmaking bodies in this country enact rules and regulations only with the > consent of the governed. The very process of lawmaking demands and > incorporates contributions by \\"the people,\\" in an infinite variety of > individual and organizational capacities. Even when a governmental body > consciously decides to enact proposed model building codes, it does so based > on various legislative considerations, the sum of which produce its version > of \\"the law.\\" In performing their function, the lawmakers represent the > public will, and the public are the final \\"authors\\" of the law.293 F.3d at > 799. SBCCI is wrong about access, too, the court maintained. That law is in the public domain means that it is there \\"for whatever use the citizens choose to make of it. Citizens may reproduce copies of the law for many purposes, not only to guide their actions but to influence future legislation, educate their neighborhood association, or simply to amuse.\\" The public's rights cannot be reconciled with \\"with the statutory right of a copyright holder to exclude his work from any publication or dissemination.\\" SBCCI responds that \\"the fair use doctrine as well as its honorable intentions will prevent abuse. Free availability of the law, by this logic, has degenerated into availability as long as SBCCI chooses not to file suit.\\" The court said it rejected that: \\"Instead, we read Banks, Wheaton, and related cases consistently to enunciate the principle that the law,\\" whether it has its source in judicial opinions or statutes, ordinances or regulations, is not subject to federal copyright law.\\"293 F.3d at 799‚Äì800 In deciding that the municipal building codes in this case could be freely copied, the court relied on the First Circuit's decision in Building Officials & Code Administrators v. Code Technology, Inc.,628 F.2d 730 (1st Cir. 1980), (BOCA)‚Äîthe only other appellate case addressing a similar enactment of a model building code. The court distinguished cases from the Ninth and Second Circuits holding that government reference to (not copying or enactment of) a preexisting private system for identifying medical conditions and a listing of valuations for used cars did not eliminate the copyright owners' rights to prevent others from making copies of the material.See Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. American Med. Ass'n, 121 F.3d 516 (1997), opinion amended by 133 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 1998); CCC Info. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Market Reports, Inc., 44 F.3d 61 (2d Cir. 1994). Effect of copyright statute Under the copyright statute, facts are unprotectable. Moreover, there is a merger of idea and expression once a model building code is enacted into positive law. Because there is only one way to express the meaning of the building codes, the idea embodied in the law merges with SBCCI's expression, and at that point, renders copyright protection unavailable. Under the Supreme Court's Feist decision, facts \\"may not be copyrighted and are part of the public domain available to every person.\\"See Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 348 (1991). SBCCI argues that this \\"ignores the goal of fostering competition in creativity.\\" It also argues that no merger occurs here \\"because there are many possible ways to express model codes: both the multiplicity of building standards and the variety of ways to express those standards compel the conclusion that the ideas have not merged with their expression.\\" The court replied that the argument misses the point: Once the law is enacted, it cannot be expressed authoritatively any way except verbatim.293 F.3d at 801-02. The court also rejected the \\"takings\\" argument: \\"This is not, however, a 'takings' case, not least because SBCCI urged localities to adopt its model codes. The issue in the case is . . . the legal consequences flowing from the permission that SBCCI gave.\\"293 F.3d at 803. Model codes versus standards Several standard-setting organizations filed amicus curiae briefs \\"out of fear that their copyrights may be vitiated simply by the common practice of governmental entities' incorporating their standards in laws and regulations.\\"293 F.3d at 803‚Äì04. The court sought to reassure them: > This case does not involve references to extrinsic standards. Instead, it > concerns the wholesale adoption of a model code promoted by its author, > SBCCI, precisely for use as legislation. Caselaw that derives from official > incorporation of extrinsic standards is distinguishable in reasoning and > result.293 F.3d at 804. The court pointed out that such organizations as the American Medical Association that had promulgated standards that government agencies later referred to in regulations had not: > solicited incorporation of their standards by legislators or regulators. In > the case of a model code, on the other hand, the text of the model serves no > other purpose than to become law. SBCCI operates with the sole motive and > purpose of creating codes that will become obligatory in law.293 F.3d at > 805.  Other policy arguments  SBCCI pleaded that > without full copyright protection for model codes, despite their enactment > as the law in hundreds or thousands of jurisdictions, SBCCI will lack the > revenue to continue its public service of code drafting. Thus SBCCI needs > copyright's economic incentives.293 F.3d at 805. The court had several responses. First, it did not believe SBCCI, since it \\"has survived and grown over 60 years\\" without court copyright protection. Second, \\"the most fruitful approach for the public entities and the potentially regulated industries lies in mutual cooperation. The self-interest of the builders, engineers, designers and other relevant tradesmen should also not be overlooked in the calculus.\\" Third: > [I]f SBCCI wants to enhance the market value of its model codes, SBCCI could > easily publish them as do the compilers of statutes and judicial opinions, > with \\"value-added\\" in the form of commentary, questions and answers, lists > of adopting jurisdictions and other information valuable to a reader. The > organization could also charge fees for the massive amount of interpretive > information about the codes that it doles out.293 F.3d at 806. The court therefore reversed the judgment against Veeck and instructed dismissal of the complaint. =Dissenting opinions= There were two dissenting opinions, one for four of the six dissenting judges, another for all six of them. The four-judge opinion argued that it should be left to Congress to decide whether such subject matter should be excluded from copyright protection.293 F.3d at 807 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). They would have decided the case on contract grounds‚Äîthat Veeck breached the license terms against copying and distribution of the code.Id. at 808. The dissenting opinion in which all six dissenters joined would have found copyright infringement.Id. at 809 (Weiner, J., dissenting). In their view the Supreme Court precedents applied only to judicial opinions.Id. at 811. The dissent regarded the majority's policy claims as mere \\"feel-good\\" and \\"symbolic\\" rhetoric, not supportable, precedent-based substantive law. The public benefits, they claimed, by delegating the code-drafting process to such organizations as SBCCI, for they can provide the service at a lower cost and in a more efficient and expert manner; however, these organizations need copyright protection to subsidize their public-service activity.Id. at 817. Attempted appeal to Supreme Court SBCCI petitioned for certiorari but it was denied. Before ruling the Court called for the views of the Solicitor General, who filed an amicus curiae brief recommending denial of certiorari. The government said: > The court of appeals' holding that such a code may be copied by interested > members of the public is correct, it is consistent with the views of the > only other court of appeals to address the same issue, and it does not > conflict with any decision of any other court of appeals.U.S. Br. at 8. Rulings in other circuits and subsequent developments It is well established that judicial opinions are not protectable by copyright.Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834). Accord, Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244 (1888); Building Officials & Code Admin. Int'l, Inc. v. Code Tech., Inc., 628 F.2d 730, 733-34 (1st Cir.1980) (reviewing case law). There is a division of authority, however, on whether to follow the Veeck case as to municipal building codes. =Seventh Circuit= In International Code Council, Inc. v. National Fire Code Protection Ass'n, Inc.,2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2006). one company engaged in the business of promoting building codes sued another such company for copyright infringement.ICC is the result of a 1994 merger among Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI). The Illinois district court interpreted Veeck to hold that it is the enactment of a model code into law that makes the code unprotectable under copyright law rather than inevitable lack of expression. The court did not reach a conclusive result, however, when the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. Among other things, the court held: \\"Defendant has not shown that the disputed provisions of Plaintiff's model building code are not copyrightable as a matter of law.\\"Id. at *93-94. In Atlantic Woodland Corp. v. DRH Cambridge Homes, Inc.,2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4964 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2003). the court considered a copyright infringement action for copying village development plans that had been accepted as part of an agreement to annex the area, so that the plans became required by law and fell into the public domain. The court held those such facts, if proved, would provide a complete defense, and it therefore denied a motion to dismiss the defense.Id. at *23. =Ninth Circuit= On the other hand, in Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. American Med. Ass'n, the Ninth Circuit held that incorporation of a classification system (taxonomy) for medical procedures in Medicare and Medicaid regulations does not make them unprotectable under copyright law.121 F.3d 516, 518-20 (9th Cir. 1997). However, the court limited the ability of the AMA to enforce its copyright against a health maintenance organization that used the taxonomy in order to comply with federal law requiring it.Id. at 520. The court viewed such copyright enforcement as copyright misuse ‚Äì an inequitable extension of the copyright owner's otherwise lawful monopoly. The Ninth Circuit also considered improper a bargain that the AMA had made with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), in which AMA licensed the agency to use its copyrighted taxonomy on a royalty-free basis \\"in exchange for HCFA's agreement not to use a competing coding system.\\"Id. at 520. =Second Circuit= And in CCC Info. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Mkt. Reports, Inc., the Second Circuit held that incorporation of used-car valuations in insurance statutes and regulations does not make them unprotectable by copyright.44 F.3d 61, 73-74 (2d Cir. 1994). =First Circuit= In John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc.,322 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003). the First Circuit declined to follow Veeck. A real estate developer had acquired a parcel of land covered by a 30-year restrictive covenant to which a previous owner had agreed. The covenant required that any residential development conform with site plan drawings submitted by the previous owner. The new owner tried to modify these restrictions; when it failed to do so it built a condominium subdivision that adhered to the site plans in the covenant. The architectural firm that had earlier designed those plans then sued for copyright infringement, and eventually won a jury verdict and a judgment in the district court for over $1.3 million‚Äîessentially all the profits made from the now-complete condominium project. The district court dismissed the affirmative defense based on Veeck. The defendant corporation that had built the condominium subdivision appealed. On appeal, the First Circuit held that the covenant and its drawings were not equivalent to the village zoning law nor was the village's vote to approve the restrictive covenant, incorporating by reference the drawings; it therefore held Veeck inapplicable and affirmed the judgment.Id, at 39-40. In an earlier First Circuit case, however, Building Officials & Code Adm'rs v. Code Tech., Inc., the court had denied copyright protection in a building code that a private organization drafted, because the court thought the group did not need a copyright incentive to draft the code and because the court saw potentially serious due process concerns with access to the code if the copyright was enforceable.Building Officials & Code Adm'rs v. Code Tech., Inc., 628 F.2d 730, 734-35 (1st Cir. 1980). =Federal Circuit patent case= In State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.,149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998). the Federal Circuit upheld the validity of a patent that effectively covered a section of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations. In its 1998 State Street Bank opinion, the Federal Circuit upheld U.S. Patent No. 5,193,056, entitled \\"Data Processing System for Hub and Spoke Financial Services Configuration,\\" because it \\"produced 'a useful, concrete and tangible result'‚Äîa final share price momentarily fixed for recording and reporting purposes and even accepted and relied upon by regulatory authorities and in subsequent trades.\\" As shown in the Wikipedia article on the case, a chart is shown that illustrates how the wording of the patent claim corresponds to the US tax statute and regulations, so that the patent is thus, in effect, one on compliance with US tax law by using a computer (which is the only feasible way to comply with the law). In In re Bilski, however, the Federal Circuit decided that the State Street Bank test \\"is insufficient to determine whether a claim is patent-eligible under ¬ß 101,\\"In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 959 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc). and \\"is inadequate,\\"Id. at 960. so that it \\"should not longer be relied on.\\"Id. at 960 n.19. On the appeal of Bilski to the Supreme Court, a concurring opinion by Justice Breyer stated that the members of the Court were unanimous that State Street was not the law.See Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 659-60 (2010). Commentary Many academic commentators support the Fifth Circuit's approach in Veeck as advancing the public interest but some criticize it as a derogation of creators' rights and as disincentivizing. =Cunningham= Lawrence A. Cunningham,Private Standards In Public Law: Copyright, Lawmaking and the Case of Accounting, 104 . 291 2005). compared the three Veeck opinions‚Äîthe Jones majority opinion, the Higginbotham dissent, and the \\"blistering\\" Weiner dissent.See id at 305. Cunningham saw Higginbotham's dissenting opinion as the one of the three opinions that \\"most resonates in expressing the federal judiciary's inherent limitations in addressing such a sprawling public policy issue.\\"Id. at 307. In his view: \\"Cases and controversies federal courts resolve are not suitable forums to provide optimal solutions to the problems of private standards embodied in public law. Such a framework must be provided by a more elaborate policy-oriented process.\\"Id. Cunningham suggests that when government endorsement abrogates copyright, as Veeck holds, perhaps that is a \\"taking\\" that the Constitution insists be based on procedural due process and adequate compensation. = Ghosh = Shubha GhoshShubha Ghosh, Copyright as Privatization: The Case of Model Codes, 78 653 (2004).] questions the viability of a market-oriented approach in which it is assumed \\"that citizens do have access because either the market will provide the code to public entities, who make the decisions about access to citizens, or the market will provide to those who can pay.\\"Id. at 686. He argues: > But by turning the drafting process into a market, one potentially turns a > democratic process into a discrete transaction between a demander of laws > (the legislature) and a supplier of laws (the drafting organization). > Furthermore, the financing of law making through public means also > undermines democratic values. In most private code drafting cases, the > organization allows the state to use the model code without charge. The > organization finances its enterprise through sales of the draft code to > libraries, law firms, and other interested parties. In other words, general > tax revenues are not used to fund law making. To the extent that tax > revenues serve to maintain government accountability, the power over the > purse strings is lost in the process.Id. at 686. Ghosh considers unworkable the majority compromise in which the black-letter text of the code is not subject to copyright while the notes and comments are subject.See Veeck, 293 F.2d at 806. He argues that the text often cannot be understood properly without recourse to the notes and comments, because of \\"the interdependence between enacted code and notes, both for interpretation purposes and in the enactment process.\\"Ghosh at 688. He points to alternative incentivization means: \\"professionals in the fields affected by particular standards and codes may have ample incentive to continue to buy the official sets of standards notwithstanding the potential availability of other, unofficial editions.\\"Id. at 689 (quoting amicus curiae brief of Solicitor General regarding the certiorari petition. Brief of Amicus Curiae United States, at 18-19, Veeck case, 537 U.S. 1043 (2002) (No. 02-355). =Karjala= Dennis Karjala sees building codes as functional works designed to regulate how buildings are built: > The case against copyright protection for privately drafted model codes is . > . . quite strong, on both public policy and traditional copyright grounds. > The initial panel decisionSee 241 F.3d 398 (5th Cir. 2001), rev'd, 293 F.3d > 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc). and the en banc dissent in Veeck, however, as > well as the cases on which they rely, show the power of the \\"restitutionary > impulse\\" in the judiciary and courts' willingness to fill apparent gaps in > protection by expanding copyright coverage.

Karjala, Distinguishing Patent and Copyright Subject Matter, > 35 439, 503 (2003). =Hardy= Trotter Hardy views Veeck as an example of eminent domain without compensation: \\"In other words, we have a case of some governmental body taking action to turn what was otherwise an item of private property into a public one, for sound reasons of public benefit.\\" But the \\"taking\\" is without compensation under the Fifth Amendment's requirements for \\"due process\\" and \\"just compensation.\\"See CCC Ifo. Servs., Inc. v. Maclean Hunter Mkt. Reports, 44 F.3d 61,74 (2d Cir. 1994) (\\"would raise very substantial problems under the Takings Clause of the Constitution\\"). Moreover, Veeck does not openly \\"take\\" the property. Instead, it determines that \\"if the government has a need for the use of . . . private property, then the property must no longer be 'property' at all.\\" Hardy argues that if a building code is original and expressive enough to gain copyright in the first place, the legislative act of making it a law does not change those facts to turn it into non- property.Trotter Hardy, The Copyrightability of New Works of Authorship, 38 855, 877-78 (2001). =McJohn= Stephen McJohn argues that the Veeck court's use of the merger doctrine to resolve the case \\"is a blunt instrument because it entails holding that the model code loses all copyright protection once adopted.\\" That would permit not only nonprofit uses but also copying and use \\"for strictly commercial purposes.\\" In contrast, application of the doctrine of \\"fair use would permit a more nuanced approach.\\" Moreover, the fair use doctrine \\"can be used to authorize free expression without the doctrinal problems of the merger doctrine.\\"Stephen M. McJohn, Eldred's Aftermath: Tradition, The Copyright Clause, and the Constitutionalization of Fair Use, 10 95, 132 (2003). =Hughes= Justin Hughes also argues for use of an alternative doctrine. He maintains that implied license is a better tool than the fair use doctrine or merger doctrine in cases such as Veeck. The problem Hughes sees with fair use is that the fourth statutory fair use factor‚Äîeffect on the plaintiff's market‚Äîhas become dominant. That would tend to outlaw wholesale copying as occurred in Veeck. \\"In contrast, the implied license doctrine may both cover the most important created fact cases and prompt a certain amount of self-selection on the question of copyright incentives.\\" Hughes argues that the facts of such cases typically support an implied license rationale: \\"once the model code is written, the professional association effectively 'hands it over' to the government knowing that the government will reproduce and distribute the expression. In the case law, these are paradigmatic indicators of an implied license.\\"Justin Hughes, Created Facts and the Flawed Ontology of Copyright Law, 83 43, 95‚Äì96 (2007). Hughes proposes that the scope of the implied license should be \\"determined by considering the reasonable expectations of the parties in view of all of the circumstances, including the parties' conduct.\\"Id. at 97 & n.298 (citing Mark D. Janis, A Tale of the Apocryphal Axe: Repair, Reconstruction, and the Implied License in Intellectual Property Law, 58 423, 502 (1999) for this formulation of the test). He concludes that the merger doctrine does not need to be abandoned in this field, especially where the circumstances are such that the subject matter \\"would be created even if the creator knew that the results would not be protectable under copyright.\\" But in cases where the \\"elimination of copyright's incentive for yet-to-be-created expressions . . . would prevent [them] from ever coming into existence,\\" merger should give way to sharing under what amounts to a compulsory license. This would preserve the incentive policies of copyright law and the public policy underlying the merger doctrine. \\"Instead of doctrine-distorting machinations to withhold application of the merger doctrine, we should apply it in a sensible way that does not destroy the future flow of both expressions of facts and the facts themselves.\\"Hughes, id. at 108. =Samuelson= Pamela Samuelson sees \\"perverse incentives\\" in permitting copyright protection on model codes, saying the Veeck case illustrates the temptation created: > Under the deal SBCCI offered, local governments such as those in Anna and > Savoy got royalty-free rights to use the code and one or more copies to make > available in a public office. 20 8 But SBCCI charged a substantial fee to > anyone else who wanted a copy of the code or access to it, and got referrals > from building inspectors and other public officials, making public employees > into a kind of free sales force for SBCCI. The perverse incentives problem > is of particular concern because of the increasing frequency with which > governments are actively encouraging government adoption of privately > drafted industry standards.Pamela Samuelson, Questioning Copyrights in > Standards, 48 B.C.L. . 193, 223 (2007). Samuelson questions whether organizations need copyright incentives to develop and maintain industry standards and codes that they promulgate and whether arguments based on incentives should prevail over other considerations. She maintains that they generally have ample incentives to develop them for use by professionals in their fields and that \\"it is simply not credible to claim that organizations . . . would stop developing [them] without copyright protection.\\"Id, at 222. =Sibley= Jessica Sibley takes issue with the Fifth Circuit majority's \\"unfair\\" assertion‚Äî\\"The citizens are the authors of the law, and therefore its owners, regardless of who actually drafts the provisions, because the law derives its authority from the consent of the public, expressed through the democratic process.\\"See 293 F.3d at 799. She dismisses this as power to the people rhetoric and mythology used as an excuse for expropriation of the property rights of SBCCI: > This political origin story justifies the redistribution of property from > private sweat and equity to \\"the people\\" who are thereby enriched (albeit > via an enrichment of the public domain) with the casting of a ballot.

It is referred to by the common names dwarf eelgrass or Japanese eelgrass, and is native to the seacoast of eastern Asia from Russia to Vietnam, and introduced to the western coast of North America. It is found in the intertidal zone and the shallow subtidal, and grows on sandy, muddy and silty substrates. Distribution and habitat It is considered native in the Russian Far East (Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Primorye, and the Kuril Islands), Japan, Korea, China, Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan and Vietnam. It was first reported as being naturalized in British Columbia and in the US State of Washington,Heinrich Gustav Adolf Engler. 1907. Das Pflanzenreich 31(IV. 11): 32.

Taxon 50(2): 432, Nanozostera americana and Nanozostera japonica but is now considered invasive as far south as California. It is believed to have been introduced with a shipment of Japanese oysters some time in the first half of the twentieth century. This seagrass is mainly found in sheltered bays where the seabed is sand, mud or silt. It occurs in the intertidal zone and at depths down to about . Ecology Japanese eelgrass is a small species and usually grows on the upper edge of seagrass beds, typically on mudflats exposed at low tide. The plants lose many of their leaves in the winter. In Hong Kong, algae grows on the blades of this seagrass and snails in the species Clithon graze on this epiphytic growth. In a research study, where the snails were excluded from certain areas of seagrass bed, the epiphytic load increased and this had a deleterious effect on the total biomass of the seagrass, reducing the amount of photosynthesis and increasing physical damage from waves and currents. In the presence of the snails, the grass blades were kept cleaner, were less likely to break off and their total biomass was increased. On the west coast of North America, the non-native Japanese eelgrass is now found in the same habitats as the native common eelgrass (Zostera marina), growing beside it and sometimes displacing it. The habitat in which they both occur is used by economically important shellfish. Further research is needed to clarify the roles of the two species in the habitat and whether any management strategies are needed to protect the native species from the invader. One difference between the two is that Z. marina undergoes microbial decomposition more slowly than does Z. japonica so that nutrients are recycled more quickly with the latter, giving alterations in both total productivity and in the structure of the decomposer community.

It is a lengthy collection of retellings of various myths and legends from Greece and Scandinavia. It was begun in 1868 and several later volumes followed until 1870. The Earthly Paradise was generally well received by reviewers: according to one study it \\"established Morris's reputation as one of the foremost poets of his day\\".Amanda Hodgson,The Romances of William Morris. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2011 (), p. 51. The Gentle Music of a Bygone Day, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, 1873, National Trust, Wightwick Manor Morris uses a frame story concerning a group of medieval wanderers searching for a land of everlasting life. After much disillusionment they discover a surviving colony of Greeks with whom they exchange stories. The poem is divided into twelve sections, each section representing a month of the year and containing two tales told in verse, drawn largely from classical mythology or mediaeval legends, including the Icelandic sagas. All of Morris's subsequent books were published as \\"by the author of The Earthly Paradise\\".  Story  The prologue introduces a company of Norsemen who have fled the pestilence and set sail to seek the fabled Earthly Paradise \\"across the western sea where none grow old.\\" Not having succeeded in their quest, they have returned \\"shrivelled, bent, and grey,\\" after lengthy wanderings abroad, to a \\"nameless city in a distant sea\\" where the worship of the ancient Greek gods has not died out. In this hospitable city they spend the rest of their lives. Twice each month they participate in a feast at which a tale is told, alternately, by one of the city elders and one of the wanderers. The former tell tales on classical subjects, and the latter draw their tales from Norse and other medieval sources. Thus, of the twenty-four stories, twelve are Greek and classical and twelve are medieval or romantic. Each pair of stories corresponds with one of the twelve months, the first two being told in January, the second two in February, and so on. Thus the long poem is neatly partitioned into twelve books with interpolated prologues and epilogues in the form of lyrics about the progressive changes in nature.  Form  The Earthly Paradise is written in different forms. William Morris used rhyme royal,Victor Shea,William Whitla, Victorian Literature: An Anthology, p. 698. heroic couplet or iambic tetrameter.

He was the fourth son of Ras Kassa Haile Darge, and his wife Princess (Le'ilt) Tsige Mariam Beshah. Prince Aserate Kassa was educated at Monkton Combe School in the United Kingdom between 1937 and 1938. He was married to (Le'ilt) Zuriashwork Gebre-Igziabiher, daughter of Jantirar Gebre-Igziabiher, and granddaughter of Empress Menen Asfaw, consort of Emperor Haile Selassie I. Prince Aserate Kassa was the head of the Selalle sub-branch of the Shewan branch of Ethiopia's Imperial Solomonic dynasty.  Life  Over the years Haile Selassie I ruled Ethiopia, Aserate held several positions including Governor of Arsi, and of Shewa. In 1964, he was appointed Viceroy of Eritrea. His chief rival was Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold. The rivalry between the two prominent figures was caused by the suspicions between the conservative court faction made up largely but not exclusively of the nobility and church hierarchy, and led by Prince Aserate, and the faction of reformers led by the commoner technocrats led by the Prime Minister and officials largely of humble birth that owed their education and appointment to positions of power to the Emperor. In 1966, Aserate Kassa was raised from Dejazmach to Ras.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 276. His elevation followed the death of his father Leul Ras Kassa, and his assumption of the headship of the Selalle line of the dynasty. Ras Aserate struggled with the growing unrest in Eritrea. One part of his response was to create two armed groups under his direct control and funding: a commando force made primarily of Christian Eritreans and trained by the Israelis, and an Eritrean security force. The other part was to engage in discrete negotiations in hope of reconciling most of the populace based on appeals to shared highland Christian heritage. However, growing violence by the rebels enabled Aklilu Habte-Wold to undercut his authority and encourage the army to take harsher measures. By 1968 the rebels were fighting pitched battles against Ethiopian military forces. Israeli advisors failed to effectively control the tendency of Ethiopian commanders to use brutal tactics, which drove civilians to seek protection from the rebels. Only with difficulty did Ras Asrate dissuade Emperor Haile Selassie from listening to Aklilu and his generals and declare martial law in Eritrea in early 1970. Nevertheless, the Emperor authorized major military campaigns, which not only failed to defeat the insurgents but caused the death of the commanding general. Aklilu's faction was able to convince the Emperor to recall Ras Aserate, declare martial law in Eritrea, and appoint General Debebe Haile Mariam military governor.Henze, Layers of Time, pp. 277‚Äì9. Despite this loss of prestige, Haile Selassie selected Ras Aserate in July 1971 as President of the Crown Council, to rejuvenate that body and oversee an orderly transfer of power on Haile Selassie's death to his designated successor, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen.Henze, Layers of Time, p. 282. When the Emperor was deposed and the Derg took power, Aserate Kassa was imprisoned and later executed along with 60 other imperial officials on 23 November 1974. His widow Princess Zuriashwork endured 14 years of harsh imprisonment before being released with the other women of the Imperial dynasty.

They are known for making traditional specialties including previous owner Edward Shane's buttercream chocolates and Pennsylvania clear toy candy. History Since 1863, candy and candy-making materials have been made or sold in the premises at 110 Market Street (originally known as the High Street), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The location was part of an active candy-making industry that grew up around the sugar trade. In 1910, Philadelphia was home to as many as 1,200 confectioneries. Members of the Herring candy-making family operated several properties in the area beginning in the 1840s. Samuel L. Herring opened a wholesale confectionery supply business at 112 Market in the 1850s, expanding to 110 Market Street in 1863. After the American Civil War, his son Benjamin W. Herring took over the business. He eventually went into partnership with one of his father's employees, confectioner Daniel S. Dengler. The partners sold wholesale confectionery goods at 110 Market until Benjamin Herring died. Daniel S. Dengler and his son, Frank Dengler, continued to operate the business until 1899, when they sold the building to William T. Wescott. In 1910, Wescott moved to New Jersey, selling the business to Edward R. Shane. The family business was taken over by Edward's son Barry Shane in 1983. The Shane family operated the location as a retail business for the next 99 years. Shane Confectionery interior, 2018 In 2010, the business was bought by brothers Ryan and Eric Berley. They chose to retain the \\"Shane Confectionery\\" name. They have restored the building and its contents, including vintage features such as the scales and the cash register. They use restored original machinery and traditional artisanal confectionery recipes to make many of the sweets they sell. For example, their cast-iron buttercream churn was used in the 1920s by Edward Shane. The confectionery store is only a few doors away from their other restored business, a vintage ice-cream shop called the Franklin Fountain. Specialties Shane Confectionery makes traditional specialties including wrapped buttercream chocolates and clear toy candy for Christmas and Easter.

Linnaea 35: 168 Zostera muelleri Paul Friedrich August Ascherson. 1867. Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin : 15. Zostera muelleri and New Zealand. Today, Zostera muelleri can be found in regions of Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea, as well as areas of the eastern Indian Ocean, and the southwest and western central Pacific Ocean. Zostera muelleri is a marine angiosperm, and is commonly referred to as eelgrass or garweed. It is a fast growing and readily colonizing species that serves as a feeding ground for wading birds and aquatic animals, and a breeding ground for juvenile fish and shrimp species. Seagrasses are a flowering plant species, not to be confused with seaweed, which do not form flowers, fruits, and seeds to reproduce. Seagrasses are important to the marine ecosystem for many reasons. For one, they provide food, homes, and breeding grounds to a variety of marine species. Secondly, meadows of seagrass are important carbon reservoirs or sinks, sequestering 10-18% of the ocean's carbon accumulation for long-term storage. Seagrasses also enhance sediment accretion, and protect coastlines from destructive wave energy.  Taxonomy  Zostera muelleri belongs to the order Alismatales. There are approximately 72 species of seagrasses. There are three families of seagrasses, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae, and Cymodoceaceae. There is some taxonomic uncertainty with this species. Zostera muelleri is synonymous with Z. mucronata, Z. capricorni, and Z. novazelandica, which were once separate species, but since then molecular and morphological studies have confirmed that they are members of the same species. In 2006, Jacobs et al. (2006) suggested the final name of the species be Z. muelleri. Zostera muelleri has three subspecies, Z. muelleri subsp. capricorni, Z. muelleri subsp. mucronata, and Z. muelleri subsp. muelleri.  Habitat and geographic range  Zostera muelleri is a perennial species, meaning populations of it endure year round. They are mostly found in places such as littoral or sublittoral sand flats, sheltered coastal embayments, soft, muddy, sandy areas near a reef, estuaries, shallow bays, and in intertidal shoals. They aren‚Äôt common on reefs because there is little space and nutrients for them to grow there. Zostera muelleri is a marine species, but it can tolerate some freshwater inputs. It mostly occurs in mono-specific meadows, but it can grow alongside Ruppia, Halophila, and Lepilena. Zostera muelleri is widespread in Southern Australia, and its also found in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.  Morphology  This species has long strap-shaped leaves, rounded leaf tips and thin rhizomes that are <3 mm in diameter. There are visible cross-veins in the leaf. The rhizomes are either dark brown or yellow. Young rhizomes are typically yellow, but the leaves of this plant can turn red if they're under high sunlight. Because of its phenotype, Z. muelleri can be confused with Z. tasmanica and Z. capensis. The leaf width morphology is variable, so Z. muelleri with thin leaves can sometimes also be confused with H. uninervus.  Adaptations to marine life  The species Z. muelleri evolved from terrestrial plants, but adapted to marine life around 140 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. In order to adapt to life in the ocean, the Z. muelleri genome lost/modified several genes which had once helped them survive on land, such as genes for hormone biosynthesis and signaling and cell wall catabolism. Some of the genes that were lost include genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling pathways, as well as genes involved in pectin catabolism. Additionally, genes for stomatal differentiation, terpenoid synthesis, and ultraviolet resistance were lost. The genes responsible for salinity tolerance and stress-resistance remain in the genome.  Reproduction  Seagrasses are flowering species, but they can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reproducing sexually increases genetic variation, which can enhance a plant's ability to adapt to a changing environment, but asexual reproduction requires less effort and is what Z. muelleri typically uses to maintain its population. When reproducing sexually, the plant's flowers form an inflorescence that is enclosed in a spathe (a large sheathing bract that encloses flower clusters in certain plant species). Each shoot can have up to 6 spathes, which contain 4-12 pairs of male and female flowers. Larger plants will have more flowers. Male flowers typically mature before female flowers. Once a flowering shoot matures, it darkens and breaks off the plant, and floats away. The enclosed seeds then become deposited in sediment someplace else. Zostera muelleri can reproduce asexually via rhizome encroachment, which is a form clonal reproduction. The plant can use this form of regeneration to recover from high intensity disturbances.  Threats and losses  Threats to this species include coastal development, eutrophication, boat mooring, dredging, agricultural/urban runoff, and sedimentation. Meadows of Z. muelleri have been lost in areas of Port Phillip Bay and New Zealand due to habitat disturbance, sedimentation, and turbidity. During the 1960s, meadows of Z. muelleri in New Zealand were affected by a wasting disease. Because it is less tolerant of heat than other tropical species, climate change may be a threat to meadows of this species in tropical regions.  Conservation  There are currently no conservation measures for this species.

It is especially popular at Easter and Christmas. The hard candy is made in molds, in a multitude of fanciful shapes. The candy is tinted in bright colors, traditionally yellow, red and green. A stick is sometimes added before the candy completely cools to make a lollipop. The names clear toy candy and barley sugar are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to clear molded sugar candy. However traditional barley sugar is made with barley water, while clear toy candy is made with pure water. Unmolded barley sugar originated in France in the 1700s, while molded sugar candy (with or without barley as an ingredient) dates to the 1800s. Confusion arises because the older term \\"barley sugar\\" became genericized and was applied to a wide range of boiled sugar candies during the 1800s. Candy making Traditional recipes for clear toy candy tend to include sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, and water. The candy's natural color when cooled is yellow. Sometimes natural food coloring is added to make red or green. The molds are greased with olive oil, also referred to as \\"sweet oil\\", to prevent sticking. The mold was removed while the candy was still somewhat soft, and less likely to break. Rough edges were then smoothed off. Clear toy candy was often made in colder weather, to avoid the clouding and stickiness that could result from heat and humidity during cooling. A cookbook published in Chicago in 1883 includes a recipe specifically for molded clear toy candy: \\"222. Candy for Christmas Toys, Ect.\\" A modern recipe for clear toy candy has been published by Nancy Fasolt. The following photographs were taken at a candy-making demonstration by Ryan Berley of Shane Confectionery at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia. They show the candy molds being prepared, filled, and opened to remove the candy after cooling.

In Germany it was sometimes called roter zuckerhase (the red sugar hare) or Dierich Orde Glass. Most of the clear toy makers have been family-run businesses. One of the earliest clear toy candy makers in North American was William Daw Startup. William had learned candy making from his father in England. William and his wife Hagar founded the Startup Candy Factory in Provo, Utah in 1875. William died in 1878, but his wife and later his children continued the business. Clear toy candy came to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area of North America with German settlers. An active candy-making industry grew up around Philadelphia because it was a center for the sugar trade. Regennas Candy was founded in 1894 by C. Fred Regennas, and continued by his children. Regennas sold candy in Philadelphia from a horse-drawn wagon, before moving to Lititz, Pennsylvania. Young's Candies of Philadelphia was established by Johan Jung (later known as John Young) in 1897. Also a family business, it was run by Harry Young Jr. from the 1940s until his death in 2007. Many of Harry Young's clear toy candy molds were sold to the Berley brothers, who took over Shane Confectionery in 2010. Shane Confectionery continues to make and sell clear toy candy for Easter and Christmas. Maggie Wolfgang started Wolfgang Candy in York, Pennsylvania in 1918. She designed the patterns for many of her molds. Wolfgang Candy sold candy to consumers until January 2018, when it limited sales to businesses and became Wolfgang Confectionery. Shelly Brothers of Souderton, Pennsylvania, established in the 1930s, made clear toy candy until it was bought out in 1990 by the Brock Candy Company (later Brach's). Clear toy candy maker Albert Dudrear of York, Pennsylvania was an avid mold collector and candy historian. He was succeeded in selling Original Clear Toy Candy by his son-in-law Donald Culp. Clear toy candy is also found in Atlantic Canada, where it appeared as early as the 1880s. Robertson's Candy, founded in Truro, Nova Scotia by William C. Robertson in 1928, continues to make traditional clear toy candy at Christmas time. Mold makers Molds for making clear toy candy have traditionally been made from an alloy of tin and zinc called \\"composition\\", iron, aluminum, lead, or pewter. Lead and pewter are now known to be harmful if ingested, and should not be used to make clear toy candy. Composition molds are often considered the best for candy-making, because they give better detail. Valentine Clad came from Alsace, France to Philadelphia and opened a business in 1853. He made cooking and candy-making equipment, including clear toy candy molds of iron. His sons Eugene and Louis became part of the business in 1892, incorporating as V. Clad & Sons in 1896. Thomas Mills and his brother George came to Philadelphia from Melrose, Scotland in 1864. Like Clad, they produced cooking and candy-making equipment. However, Thos. Mills & Bro. used composition, an alloy of tin and zinc for their clear toy candy molds. They also created pattern molds of brass or bronze, which were used to create the candy molds. Candy molds were made in two tightly-fitting halves, generally bearing the maker's name and sometimes a patent number. At one point, demand was high enough that Mills hired Clad to make candy molds of composition, which may bear both company names, one on each side of the mold. Mills sold its molds in sets of fifty, with each mold making one or more clear toy candies, depending on the size of the candy to be made. Leonhard Schulze and Karl Hohnstock were two of the mold designers who worked for Mills before it closed in 1946. Other American mold manufacturers include Thos. J. Andress & Co., Philadelphia, who made molds for the Centennial in 1876; Crandall & Godley of New York; and Kiddie Kandie. Around 1990, the John Wright Company made some small molds with non-stick coating. Before the death of its owner, Nancy Fasolt, in 2015, Cake and Kandy Emporium of East Petersburg, Pennsylvania made reproduction molds. In Canada, J. Therien of Montreal and Fletcher Manufacturing in Toronto made molds. Molds were manufactured by G. Lieb in Stuttgart, Germany between 1868 and 1960. During World War II, many candy molds were melted down as scrap metal.

In the United States, the prevalence of patient dropout is estimated to be between 40‚Äì60% over the course of treatment however, the overwhelming majority of patients will drop after two sessions. An exhaustive meta-analysis of 146 studies in Western countries showed that the mean dropout rate is 34.8% with a wide range of 10.3% to 81.0%. The studies from the US (n = 85) had a dropout rate of 37.9% (range: 33.0% to 43.0%).  Differing definitions  Psychotherapy discontinuation can mean different things to different researchers or clinicians. Although the important aspects of what discontinuation consist of (client's decision, symptoms not adequately reduced) typically remain constant, there can still be differences of how these are measured. For example, one researcher may designate that completing 50% of sessions will mark the client as a treatment completer, where another may designate this amount at 75%. When looking at patient dropout rates, these inconsistencies can make the data difficult to understand. But the same patients might be considered non-completes in another study. Associated issues =Poor patient outcomes= Patient dropout is associated with numerous problems, such as: loss of potential patient improvement, poorer outcomes, increased likelihood of over-utilizing resources, and disruption in group therapy settings. Intuitively, these patients lose out on the benefits they may have received if they continued treatment. They also face poorer outcomes and fewer benefits of therapy compared to those who continue with treatment. Further, patients who discontinue treatment are more likely to be characterized as chronic patients, resulting in over-utilization of services, up to twice as much as \\"appropriate\\" terminators. In a group therapy session, premature discontinuation of one member may in turn adversely affect the other members of the group. =Narcissistic injury= Narcissistic injury is a possible outcome of patient dropout, where therapists and clinicians may feel a diminished sense of self and may even feel inadequate. They may interpret a patient's discontinuation of treatment as a direct result of something they did. This can lead to lower self-esteem, confidence, and thus their effectiveness which will negatively impact their delivery of treatments to other patients. There is no current research as to how often this occurs in patient dropout cases. =Clinician and administrative losses= Less apparent are the effects non-completes have on the entire mental health care system. Clinicians experience losses in the form of time spent on patient intakes, missed appointments prior to termination, and other diagnostic work performed. Administratively, these inefficiencies contribute to long waiting lists, which in turn: deny services to others, worsen community perception, and create lost income for clinics. Cyclically, long waiting lists have shown some increased dropout effects, further exacerbating the problem. Predicting at-risk patients Predicting patients at risk of dropping treatment is a difficult task that is still being researched. However, there are different factors associated with patient dropout that are worth identifying. There are several meta-analysis studies that addressed these issues. =Patient characteristics= Patient characteristics are anything innate about the patients themselves. These include: age, race, gender, education, and socioeconomic status. Several studies identify minorities as more likely candidates for dropping psychotherapy treatment. Young clients are also more likely to drop out compared to older clients. Further, socioeconomic status has been linked to client dropout, where poorer patients drop out more frequently. =Environmental factors= Environmental factors relate both to the environment of the patient and to the physical environment of the clinician's office. Research has shown that refurbishing the waiting room of an urban office resulted in a 10% increase in attendance at the first session. Also included as an environmental factor is the patient's access to care. In the United States, many insurance companies do not cover mental health treatment. This denial of care can quickly lead to patient dropout. =Beliefs and perceptions of mental health= Social stigma of mental health treatment may also result in increased patient discontinuation. This is particularly true amongst ethnic minorities. In the Latino community, the male value of machismo can often increase shame of seeking mental health due to beliefs that the individual should be able to overcome problems on their own. Perceptions of mental health may also alter patient beliefs about the effectiveness of mental health treatment. Patients receive cues on therapist expertise through their interactions, and may feel the therapist is inadequate. They may also feel that they do not share the same treatment goals. It's also possible that the initial perception that treatment is ineffective can lead to patient's seeking a reason to end treatment. Lastly, a client may have an expectation about how many sessions they will be attending. This number strongly predicts the number of sessions actually attended, which may differ from the number the therapist feels is necessary, leading to dropout. Possible solutions =Role induction= Role induction involves preparing clients for what to expect in therapy. It consists of educating patients about the nature and process of therapy, aimed to offer clients an expectation of success and to dispel therapy misconceptions. This has been found to effectively reduce discontinuation, and even to help reduce client distress. =Fostering therapeutic alliance= The therapeutic relationship is generally based on three concepts: a collaborative relationship, an affective bond between the therapist and patient, and the ability of both the client and therapist to agree on treatment goals. To strengthen this alliance, research suggests to reaffirm the main therapeutic conditions of warmth, positive regard for the client, and empathy. Communicating both respect for the patient's perspective and one's interest in working with them will help develop trust. =Motivational interviewing= Motivational interviewing (MI) or motivational enhancement is defined as \\"increasing a person‚Äôs willingness to enter into, continue, and adhere to a specific change strategy.‚Äù MI is typically seen broken into the acronyms FRAMES (Feedback, Responsibility, Advice, Menu of strategies, Empathy, and Self-efficacy) or OARS (Open questions. Affirmation, Reflection, and Summary). Other strategies have included: correcting patient misconceptions, creating incentives for change, eliciting self-motivational statements, praising patient's serious consideration of change, and refraining problem behaviors so that they appear less formidable. =Therapist feedback= By consistently checking in with patient goals and progress, therapists can detect patient deviation from the intended path and thus consider changing treatment plans or other strategies before the patient drops. An example of therapist feedback would be a chart that displays client progress. This is a concrete picture of how the client is progressing, and will engage the client to take an active role in their treatment.

Company history Volta Mining Ltd is an ASX listed (ASX: VTM) emerging junior iron ore company headquartered in Perth, Australia, which is focused on the exploration and development of its project assets and value accretive acquisition opportunities. The Company's current portfolio consists of projects in recognised iron ore precincts; the Pilbara region of Western Australia and the West African country of Gabon. In January 2014, Volta completed the acquisition of private company Pilbara Commodities Ltd, which held a number of highly prospective exploration licences. This acquisition strengthened Volta's iron ore portfolio in the Pilbara region, and included the Hancock Ranges Iron Ore Project, which is an exploration priority for the Company. As well as the Hancock Ranges Iron Project, Volta also acquired Pilbara Commodities‚Äô other projects via the acquisition, including: the Hamersley Ranges Project (Iron Ore), Bangemall Project (Copper, Zinc and Manganese) and the Pannawonica Project (Nickel, Copper). Via its project area in Gabon, Volta is one of the largest holders of prospective iron ore licences in central and West Africa, positioning it as a significant participant in the iron ore sector in the region. Its Mbombo Iron Ore Project in Gabon covers an area of 3,922km2 and is situated adjacent to the world class Belinga iron ore deposit. Volta Mining listed on the ASX on 19 October 2011. Iron Ore Projects Volta Mining has recently strengthened its iron ore portfolio with the acquisition of the entire issued capital of Pilbara Commodities Limited, which holds a 100% interest in a number of exploration licences in the Pilbara region of Australia. These include the prospective Hancock Ranges Iron Ore Project and the Hamersley Ranges Iron Ore Project. HANCOCK RANGES IRON ORE PROJECT, AUSTRALIA The Hancock Ranges Iron Ore Project is located within 10 km of the town of Newman in the Pilbara iron ore region, in the north west of Western Australia. It comprises three leases (E47/2606, E47/2607 and E47/2608) targeting Banded Iron Deposit (BID) style iron mineralisation. The Project is well situated relative to exiting operating iron ore projects as well as existing and proposed third party rail infrastructure. In August 2014, Volta completed its first drill program at the Hancock Ranges Project. The program targeted the Sirius Extension Prospect and the results confirmed the project's potential to host iron ore mineralisation at Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) grades. Drilling validated Volta's exploration model that the trend of hematite mineralisation in the area extends into the Sirius Extension Prospect, and also confirmed the existence and continuity of mineralisation at depth. The licence won priority in a recent Wardens Court ballot by Epienergy and is recommended for grant. It is close to existing and proposed third party railways and mining operations including Rio Tinto's Nammuldi/Brockman 2 operations and is neighboured by Fortescue Metals Group to the west; Aquila Steel/AMCI to the north; and Rio Tinto to the south. Geological Summary The Hamersley Ranges Iron Ore Project has potential for both bedrock and buried channel/detrital iron ore mineralization. Bedrock mineralisation associated with the lower most units of the Brockman Iron Formation is the main exploration target within the licence area. Volta Mining's consultant geologist has completed a desktop study review of the results of historical exploration that was conducted within and adjacent to the licence area. Historical exploration investigating the iron ore potential of the broader area has been conducted since the 1970s by a number of companies; the majority of work carried out by The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (‚ÄúBHP‚Äù), Rio Tinto Ltd and Robe River Mining Company Pty Ltd (‚ÄúROBE‚Äù). Exploration has comprised aerial photography and photo interpretation, mapping, rock chip sampling, drilling and geochemical analysis. BHP undertook an extensive program of exploration in the area between 1970 and 1978 and recorded several iron ore occurrences within and immediately surrounding the exploration licence area (E47/2855). In 1972, BHP Deposit 20 located near the central southern boundary of the licence (E47/2855), was mapped however, no drilling was conducted. BHP identified haematite-goethite mineralization assigned to the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation on the southern margin of the ranges. There still exists a large proportion of the rest of the licence area that is masked by Quaternary alluvium, in particular the central and northern blocks. Potential for both bedded (BID) and channel/detrital (CID/DID) iron deposits situated below recent alluvium tested has not been fully tested by historical exploration, whilst the priority target is the iron mineralization associated with the identified BHP Deposit 20. Next steps Upon licence grant, reconnaissance mapping and geochemical sampling is to be completed in order to further understand the geology, nature and scale of targets already identified within the licence area including BHP Deposit 20; as well as to identify any potential for new targets such as bedded, channel and detrital iron ore targets located under areas of recent alluvial cover. The results will assist with target prioritisation and planning of any proposed drill testing. Board & Management Volta Mining brings together a highly capable and well respected board of directors with considerable experience across all aspects of exploration, operations, finance, corporate development and capital markets. The board is complemented by an experienced team who oversee the exploration activities of Volta Mining's projects and who will manage expansion upon the identification of specific targets and that of any additional projects acquired by the company as part of its growth strategy.

Life Shah Kamal was born in Makkah, Shah Kamal Quhafah was a descendant of Abdur Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, who was the eldest son of Abu Bakr, the First Caliph of Islam. He was a Qur√©ish; belonged to Banu Tahim, which was a distinguished clan of the tribes of Ishmael and the Qur√©ish. Shah Kamal Quhafah came to Bangladesh with his newlywed wife to spread egalitarian pursuit of life and meet his father, Burhanuddin Ketan, who had already travelled to Chittagong leading an expedition of twelve Sufi dervish. Burhanuddin Ketan is known in Chittagong as Shah Kat‚Äôtal, Qat‚Äôtal Shah and Gazi Kadal Khan. He has two Mazar, one at Katalganj, Chittagong and another at Faringajuri or Faringi Bazaar.Syed Murtaja AliGhulam Saklayn He travelled to Sylhet with his wife and twelve companions in 1315 to disseminate ideals of socio-religious harmony and meet his father, Khwaja Burhanuddin Ketan, who had travelled to Sylhet a decade earlier with Shah Jalal in 1303.Srihatte Islam Jyoti, Syed Mujtaba Ali Shah Kamal and his companions sought an audience with Shah Jalal upon arriving at Sylhet. After becoming disciples of Shah Jalal, the group sojourned at Sylhet until June 1315.Dr G Saklayen, Bangladesh Sufi Sadhak The twelve companions of Kamal were Pir Kallu Shah (Pirergaon) Shah Chand (Chandbharang), Dawar Bakhsh Khatib (Dawarshahi or Dawarai), Syed Zia Uddin (Mukan Bazaar), Shamsuddin Bihari (Aatghar), Shah Faizullah (Feizi or Fesi), Shah Jalaluddin (Qusipur or Quskipur), Shah Tajuddin, Syed Bahauddin (Mukan Bazar), Shah Ruknuddin, Syed Shamsuddin] (Syedpur) and Shah Manik (Manihara).Dr G Saklayen, Bangladesh Sufi Sadhak Kamal was a pioneer, known for his initiatives to establish the very first human settlement on islands of the erstwhile little sea by the name of Ratnang. Eventually, this settlement became a fully-fledged village, which now called, Shaharpara. Salient amongst his pioneering work were building of a hospice, boarding house, mosque and seminary at Shaharpara. These institutes provided unparalleled services to people. He developed fully protected ponds for the preservation of drinking water; most of these ponds are in decaying conditions and nowadays they are hardly used for drinking water. Descendants Descendants of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah are settled in Shaharpara, Patli Aurangabad and Dargah Mahallah in Sylhet and they have formed very distinguished families, which are known as Kamalis of Shaharpara, Qurayshis of Patli and Muftis of Sylhet. Kamali, Qurayshi, Mufti, Khwaja, Siddiqui and Shah are the surnames invariably used by the descendants of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah. Descendants of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah have mainly extended to a number of families: Mullah Family, Shahjee Family, Baglar Family in Shaharpara, Qureshi Family in Patli and Mufti Family in Sylhet Dargah Mahallah. Maulana Shah Shamsuddin Qureshi, a descendant of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah, established the Qurayshi family in Patli and Maulana Shah Zia Uddin Qurayshi, another descendant of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah, established the Mufti Family at Dargah Mohallah, Sylhet.Dr G Saklayn =Mullah Bari= Mullah Bari was established by Shah Jalaluddin Qureshi, eldest son of Shah Kamal, and hitherto it belongs to his progeny.

Alspach has also studied the mathematics behind poker, and writes for Poker Digest and Canadian Poker Player magazines. Biography Brian Alspach was born on May 29, 1938 in North Dakota. He attended the University of Washington from 1957 to 1961, receiving his B.A. in 1961. He taught at a junior high school for one year before beginning his graduate studies. In 1964 he received his master's degree and in 1966 he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Barbara under the supervision of Paul Kelly. He taught at Simon Fraser University for 33 years. He retired from there in 1998. He currently works as an adjunct professor at the University of Regina and has been there since 1999. He is responsible for creating an industrial mathematics degree at Simon Fraser University.http://www.mathcentral.uregina.ca/humanface/career/profiles/brianalspach.pdf Brian Alspach believes that the growth and future of mathematics will depend on the business people in the industrial businesses.http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/humanface/careers/profiles/brianalspach.pdf His interests are in graph theory and its applications. One of his theories of coverings and decomposition has been applied to scheduling issues that can arise in the business world. Alspach states that his biggest issue with this is trying to explain such complex math to people in the business world with only a basic understanding of math. He has mentored a total of 13 Ph.D. students. His wife is the former vice president of academics at the University of Regina where he was an adjunct professor. Brian is currently employed as conjoint professor at the University of Newcastle. Research One of his first publications was an article titled Cycles of each length in regular tournaments, which was published in the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin (November, 1967). Another influential piece of Brian Alspach is Point- symmetric graphs and digraphs of prime order and transitive permutation groups of prime degree, which was published in the Journal of Combinatorial Theory (August, 1973). In his article titled Isomorphism of circulant graphs and digraphs which was published in Discrete Mathematics (February, 1979). He discusses the isomorphism problem for a special class of graphs. Brian Alspach coauthored an article with T.D. Parsons titled A construction for vertex ‚Äìtransitive graph published in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics (April, 1982). Alspach's conjecture, posed by Alspach in 1981, concerns the characterization of disjoint cycle covers of complete graphs with prescribed cycle lengths. With Heather Gavlas Jordon, in 2001, Alspach proved a special case, on the decomposition of complete graphs into cycles that all have the same length. This is possible if and only if the complete graph has an odd number of vertices (so its degree is even), the given cycle length is at most the number of vertices (so that cycles of that length exist), and the given length divides the number of edges of the graph. A proof of the full conjecture was published in 2014.

The church, which was heavily rebuilt during the 19th century, houses several medieval furnishings. Breds√§ttra socken is mentioned first in a letter from c. 1320, and another from 1346. It had a harbor town of some importance, Sikehamn, during the Middle Ages, from which limestone was exported. After the municipal reform in 1862, the responsibility for the ecclesiastical and civil organization of the socken was transferred to the Breds√§ttra parish and landskommun, respectively. The latter was incorporated into √ñland's K√∂pingsvik district in 1952, and this in turn was incorporated into Borgholm Stad in 1969 and then Borgholm Municipality in 1971.

Types, characteristics, and manufacturers Drum magazines are high-capacity magazines that are in a cylindrical shape; they once had a reputation for unreliability, but technological improvements resulted in better performance and cheaper cost.Ben Kesling & Zusha Elinson, Mass Shootings Draw Attention to 'Drum Magazines', Wall Street Journal (August 16, 2019). As a result, drum magazines became more common in the civilian market in the United States, although they are far less common than standard, lower-capacity box magazines. As of 2019, about six manufacturers produced drum magazine in the United States, retailing for about $100 each. Manufacturers include KCI USA and Magpul Industries; the latter produces the same drum magazines for both civilian and military use. Legal status =United States= A 15-round Glock 19 magazine, legally defined as a high-capacity magazine in some areas Federal law Between 1994 and 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which included a ban on high-capacity magazines, was in effect. It prohibited new magazines over 10 rounds in the United States. After the expiration of the ban, there is no nationwide prohibition against the possession of high- capacity magazines, which are considered an unregulated firearm accessory. Legislation to restore a federal high-capacity magazine ban has been repeatedly introduced by Democrats in the United States Congress since the expiration of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, especially in the wake of mass shootings in the United States in which high-capacity magazines were used, including the Tucson shooting (2011), the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting (2012), and the Harvest music festival shooting (2017).Jennifer Steinhauer, Pro-Gun Lawmakers Are Open to Limits on Size of Magazines, New York Times (February 18, 2013).Elizabeth Landers, Democrats propose high- capacity gun magazine ban, CNN (February 12, 2019).

The nine states with high-capacity-magazine limitations are California (Proposition 63, passed in 2016), Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. Hawaii's magazine-size limitation only applies to handguns; the laws in the other eight states and D.C. apply to all types of guns. All of the ten jurisdictions with magazine- size limits set the maximum at 10 rounds, except for Colorado (which sets a maximum of 15 rounds) and Vermont (which sets a maximum of 15 rounds for handguns and 10 rounds for long-guns). The types of acts prohibited varies among the ten jurisdictions; most prohibit manufacturer, sale, or possession, but some states' laws are narrower (Maryland law does not ban possession of high-capacity magazines) while other states' laws are broader (some states also ban the transfer, transportation, or acquisition of high-capacity magazines). Some states' laws include \\"grandfather\\" pre-ban high-capacity magazines, exempting these from their law, while other states' laws do not.

In DART, a weighted average is used where the weights reflect the degree of the nodes in the pruned network. The denoising step removes prior information that is inconsistent with a data set. This strategy substantially improves unsupervised predictions of pathway activity that are based on a prior model, which was learned from a different biological system or context. Pre-existing methods such as gene set enrichment analysis method attempt to infer. However, it did not construct a structured list of genes. SPIA (Signaling Pathway Impact analysis) is a method that uses the phenotype information to evaluate the pathway activity between two phenotypes. However, it does not identify the pathway gene subset that could be used to differentiate individual samples. CORG is used to identify a relevant gene subset. It is a supervised method, which does not perform as well as DART in analyzing independent data set Understanding molecular pathway activity is crucial for risk assessment, clinical diagnosis and treatment. Meta-analysis of complex genomic data is often associated with difficulties such as extracting useful information from big data, eliminating confounding factors and providing more sensible interpretation. Different approaches have been taken to highlight the identification of relevant pathway in order to provide better gene expression prediction.  Method  File:DART method.jpg  Strategy  #Build a network of all genes that are involved in the pathway #Evaluate the consistency of the prior regulatory information #Remove inconsistent prior information-the denoising step #Estimate pathway activity Pearson correlations were first computed between regulatory genes at the level of transcription and a gene expression data set. The correlation coefficient then underwent a Fisher's transform: : \\\\gamma_{ij}=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\log{\\\\frac{1+c_{ij}}{1-c_{ij}}} Where cij is the correlation coefficient between gene i and j, and where Œ≥ij is the variable that under the null hypothesis, its mean is zero and standard deviation 1/, where ns is the number of tumor samples. The threshold of p-value was set at 0.0001. Gene pairs with significant correlation will be considered relevant in the network. To predict the activity score in which genes that are nearby are also taken into consideration: \\\\vec S_{W\\\\;AV}=\\\\frac 1\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i\\\\in N}k_i^2}\\\\sum_{i\\\\in N}\\\\sigma_ik_i\\\\vec Z_i Where ki is the number of neighbors of gene i, zi is the normalized z-score and œÉi is a binary variable ( i.e 1 means upregulated upon activation and -1 means downregulated). This step is to estimate the activation level, in which sw AV is the activity score. A linear regression model was then applied to estimate the pathway activation levels. Thus, tij and pij denote the t-statistics and p-value associated with, whereas p<0.05 indicates a significance. To assess the consistency in a validation data set D, the performance measure Vij is denoted: V_{ij}=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in D}\\\\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}\\\\left|t_{ij}^{(d)}\\\\right|S\\\\left(p_{ij}^{d}\\\\right) Where S is defined by S(p_{ij})= \\\\begin{cases} 1 & p_{ij}\\\\le 0.05 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p_{ij}>0.05 \\\\end{cases} S is the threshold function of a given pair of pathways. And where \\\\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}= \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\mathrm{sign}\\\\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\\\\right)=\\\\mathrm{sign}\\\\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\\\\right),\\\\;d\\\\in D \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\mathrm{sign}\\\\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\\\\right)=-\\\\mathrm{sign}\\\\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\\\\right),\\\\;d\\\\in D \\\\end{cases} œÉij is the score that tells the directionality of a correlation, in which an opposite prediction will be panelized by given a value of -1. tij is the t-statistics of interpathway correlation. The performance measure Vij accounts for the significance of correlation between pathways, the direction of correlation, and the weights in the magnitude of the correlation. A two-tailed paired Wilcoxon test is performed to compare the distribution under hypothesis. Advantages and limitation: DART gives an improved performance and higher accuracy in inferring pathway activity from prior information of pathway databases. Pre-existed information and large database are needed in order for DART to run. In other words, DART requires well-established prior gene expression data to start with, and then it can proceed evaluation of consistency and denoise any irrelevant information.  Application  DART is an algorithm that is applicable and used successfully in Cancer Genomics. The DART algorithm has been shown to be a strong method for estimating the pathway activity and perturbation signature activity in breast and lung cancer gene expression data sets. Imaging traits such as mammography (Mammography is the process of using low-energy X-rays to examine the human breast tissue) plays an important role in cancer tumor diagnosis. Studies have shown that women with increased mammographic density have a higher risk of developing Breast cancer. Estrogen receptor alpha gene 1 encodes Estrogen Receptor-alpha, which is activated by estrogen. Polymorphisms in ESR1 are associated with breast cancer risk through differences in different level of breast density. DART successfully predicted an inverse correlation between ESR1 signaling and MMD. It can be used in simulated and real multidimensional cancer genomic data. It gives more reliable prediction about pathway activation, which would be helpful in association studies.

It was released on 17 June 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on 19 June 2011 on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. The game was developed with Microsoft's XNA tools, and its development was inspired by indie games such as flOw. The game follows the player in their mission to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects, eventually becoming a Big Crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. The game is a sequel to Solar (2009), and features most of the same key gameplay elements of its predecessor, expanded and polished considerably. It was developed over ten months and includes a score composed by sound designer and musician JP Neufeld. Solar 2 received mainly positive reviews from video game journalists, scoring 72 out of 100 on aggregate website Metacritic. It was awarded the first prize at the 2011 Microsoft Dream Build Play competition, and was among the video games showcased at the 10th Penny Arcade Expo.  Gameplay  Solar 2 is an open world sandbox video game played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages to accumulate enough mass to become a Big Crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, and is able to stay at the form of the object of their preference. Eight different objects are available in the game: asteroid, small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star, neutron star and black hole.Watts, Jay. Solar 2 (tutorial). Murudai. 2011. A player controls a medium size star with 5 orbiting planets. A mission start circle can be seen, along with arrows pointing to the other available missions. The game takes place in a borderless and randomly generated universe, filled with asteroids, planets, stars and planetary systems. Life forms are also present in the game. They appear on planets sufficiently big to store life, and are represented by a variety of ships of different size and attack power. Spaceships are coloured green if they belong to the player's planet, or to a planet that belongs to the player's planetary system; red if they belong to an enemy planet or planetary system; and white if they don't belong to any planet or system. All the spaceships in the map are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI), and they will constantly engage in combat against enemy ships, asteroids or planets to destroy them. At the beginning of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player is able to attract planets to form a planetary system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star. Growing the star will increase its gravitational force, which increases the number of planets the planetary system can have. They are also able to attract planetary systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from a small star to a life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from a small planet to an asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided. Solar 2 also includes a variety of achievements and object-oriented missions that can be played at any time. Missions can be found following the directional arrows in the interface, and the AI keeps track of which missions the player has finished. The game also keeps record of several accomplishments the player has reached, such as the distance travelled, the number of objects and enemies destroyed by the player or the spaceships belonging to the player. Solar 2 allows the player to save progress at any point. A \\"save system\\" feature is also present; it allows the player to save specific configurations of stars and planets that the player has created. The player can respawn from them at any time.  Development  Solar 2 was developed by Jay Watts under his video game studio Murudai. Watts, who received a degree in biotechnology from an Australian college, had no previous knowledge of video game development prior to coding Solar 2 predecessor, Solar, for the Xbox 360. Development of Solar started in July 2008 as a Flash game. Many of the key gameplay elements featured in the sequel, such as the infinite sandbox, were envisioned during this timespan. In an interview with FleshEatingZipper, Watts revealed that Thatgamecompany's indie game flOw was an inspiration for him: \\"I loved the simplicity of the game and the ambiance.\\" Solar, released in 2009, became a commercial success; it sold 30,000 copies and allowed Watts to work full-time on its sequel. Development of Solar 2 lasted for at least ten months. The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft. According to Watts, Solar 2 was \\"mainly expanding on [Solar] original idea and polishing it to perfection.\\" However, he commented that the concept of both games took several design iterations to reach its final version: \\"I played with many, many ideas before finally settling on what I have now.\\" Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was \\"no way I could do music as good as he can.\\" Both the Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that \\"the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do.\\"  Release  Solar 2 was released on 17 June 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on 19 June 2011 on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. In July 2012, Watts announced that he was working on Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game. However, given that the original game was developed using the Windows-only XNA platform, he expected the ports to be ready sometime before the end of the year. In October 2012, the Mac port was announced and released on Steam. The iPad version of the game was released in March 2013. An Android version was also made available in March 2013.  Reception  Solar 2 received a positive response from video game journalists upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 72 based on 8 reviews. Most critics praised the physics-based gameplay and soundtrack, but criticized the exceedingly difficult missions and somewhat repetitive gameplay. However, the game won the US$20,000 first prize at the 2011 Microsoft Dream Build Play competition, and became a finalist at the 2011 IndieCade festival. Solar 2 was also among the ten indie video games showcased at the 10th Penny Arcade Expo, held in August 2011. IGN's Gord Goble criticized the difficulty of the missions but praised the game's soundtrack, which he called a combination of \\"new age-meets-Alan Parsons Project-meets- Pink Floyd-meets-2001: A Space Odyssey audioscape.\\" He also highlighted several features he would have liked to see in the game, such as a more complex universe to explore and the ability to control the life forms in the planets controlled by the player. Graham Smith from PC Gamer was also critical of the missions' difficulty, although concluded that it was \\"a good price for a universe.\\" GamePro Nate Ralph mentioned the life forms as the only negative aspect of the game. The iPad and Android versions of Solar 2 were also well received. App Spy's Andrew Nesvadba, on his review of the iPad version of the game, highlighted the overall sense that \\"nothing about the game feels like a waste of time or effort,\\" but criticized the lack of control over the life forms. Meanwhile, Andrew Martonik from Android Central acknowledged that Solar 2 had all the elements necessary for a great game.

There are plans to extend the pipeline to Uganda's capital, Kampala, continuing on to Rwanda's capital, Kigali. Location The pipeline originates in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and travels to Nairobi, continuing to Eldoret. That part of the pipeline is in existence as of May 2014. It has been proposed that the pipeline be extended to Kigali, Rwanda, through Kampala, Uganda. The route of the pipeline, as proposed, stretches over a distance of approximately . Background The pipeline extension will connect Eldoret in Kenya to Kampala in Uganda, passing through Malaba. The pipeline will extend to Kigali in Rwanda and possibly to Bujumbura, Burundi in the future. Each country will be responsible for developing the infrastructure within its borders; however, a joint \\"transaction advisor\\" will be selected to maintain quality control. Construction The feasibility study for the Eldoret to Kampala pipeline extension was awarded to an international firm in 1997. The study was completed in 1998, and the report was submitted the following year. The study was funded by the European Investment Bank. The report indicated that building the pipeline was feasible. The feasibility study for the Kampala to Kigali extension was awarded to the East African Community in September 2011, funded with $600,000 from the African Development Bank. The governments of Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda accepted the findings of both feasibility studies. The construction contract was initially awarded, in 2007, to Tamoil, a company owned by the government of Libya. That contract was voided in 2012 after the company failed to implement the project. , fourteen companies have submitted bids to construct the pipeline extension from Kenya to Rwanda. Construction is expected to begin in 2014, with a 32-month construction timeframe. Commissioning is expected in 2016. Construction costs The total construction cost for the Eldoret-Kampala-Kigali portion of the pipeline is estimated at approximately US$5 billion.

It serves as the fifth novel in the Swindle series, with Griffin Bing and his friends Savannah, Ben, Antonia \\"Pitch\\", Logan, and Melissa. Plot Swindle is back. And he wants his dog back. After Luthor, the once menacing guard dog, (almost) won the Global Kennel Dog Show, S. Wendell Palomino (AKA Swindle) sees a chance to become rich. And with that money, he'll devote his life to ruining Griffin and his friends' lives. Griffin knows that, but when Palomino actually shows up at Savannah Drysdale's house, in the middle of Luthor's birthday party, he's still surprised. Swindle claims Luthor is still his, and the Cedarville pound cannot find the file that says the Drysdales legally adopted him (which we later find out that Palomino stole). They take this matter to court, and when the judge declares that Savannah must return Luthor to Palomino she's heartbroken. She enlists Griffin to deduct a plan to prove Luthor is rightfully hers. The book consists of 3 parts, one for each hideout, at each camp. Savannah and Griffins camp is the first hideout, Melissa and Logan's camp is the next, and Pitch and Ben's camp is the last hideout. The struggle is increased with different goons that Palomino hired, plagiarizing random people at the camp, trying to move the heavy Luthor to different camps, and the fact that they have no transportation except random delivery trucks. But if there's anything you can depend on with the Man with the Plan, is that nothing is impossible for him, and there is always everyday a way.

It is built with corner post construction on the ground floor, half-timbered style of timber framing on the upper floor and has a less common style of wood roof shingles than typical in America. American historic carpentry is the historic methods with which wooden buildings were built in what is now the United States since European settlement. A number of methods were used to form the wooden walls and the types of structural carpentry are often defined by the wall, floor, and roof construction such as log, timber framed, balloon framed, or stacked plank. Some types of historic houses are called plank houses but plank house has several meanings which are discussed below. Roofs were almost always framed with wood, sometimes with timber roof trusses. Stone and brick buildings also have some wood framing for floors, interior walls and roofs. Background Historically building methods were passed down from a master carpenter to an apprentice verbally, through demonstration, and through work experience.Noble, Allen George. Traditional buildings a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007. 7. Print. Designs, engineering details, floor plans, methods were time tested and communicated through rules of thumb rather than scientific study and documents. Each region of the world has variations on traditions, tools and materials. The carpenters who found themselves in the New World based their work on their traditions but adapted to new materials, climate, and mix of cultures. Immigrants to America were from all parts of the world so the history of American carpentry is very diverse and complex, but it is only four or five centuries old, a fraction of the history of many other regions. Notable examples of structural carpentry which were not used in America include cruck framing. Definitions Carpentry is one of the traditional trades but is not always clearly distinguished from the work of the joiner and cabinetmaker, in general a carpenter historically did the heavier, rougher work of framing a building including installing the sheathing and sub-flooring and installing pre-made doors and windows. Joiners did the finer work of installing trim and paneling. Plank and board are not consistently defined in history. Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. Board means a piece of lumber (timber) to thick and more than wide. Plank generally means a piece of lumber (timber) rectangular in shape and thicker than a board. =Gallery of wall types= File:Barn raising - Leckie's barn completed in frame.jpg|A timber frame barn during the barn raising in Canada File:Balloon frame.jpg|In balloon framing the key defining features are the full height studs with the joists landing on a ledger.

New houses from old: a guide to the planning and practice of house remodeling.. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948. Print. from the 17th-century European settlements until the early 20th century when timber framing was replaced by balloon framing and then platform framing in houses and what was called plank or \\"joist\\" framing in barns. The framing in barns is usually visible, but in houses is usually covered with the siding material on the outside and plaster or drywall on the inside. Variations of timber framing are described based on their nature at the foundation, sill plate, wall, wall plate, and roof. Posts which were dug into the ground are called earthfast or post in ground construction. This technique eliminated the need for bracing. Some buildings were framed with the posts landing on a foundation with interrupted sills. Most buildings were framed with the posts landing on a heavy timber sill, the sills (rarely) laid on the ground, supported by stones or, late in the 19th century, concrete. The structural carpentry of the walls are of several types and are discussed in detail below. French settlers called placing studs or posts on a sill spaced slightly apart poteaux-sur-sol which is similar to the English close studding. These are examples of half timbering where the framing is infilled with another material such as a mud mixture, stones, or bricks. Half timbering in America is found in limited areas, mostly of German settlement, including Old Salem, North Carolina, parts of Missouri, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania. Much more common was to build a framed building and add brick nogging between the framing which may not be considered half timbering. Half timbering is an architectural element in Tudor and Tudor Revival architecture. One of the earliest descriptions of how to build timber framed buildings in America was in a publication titled Information and Direction to Such Persons as are Inclined to America, more Especially Those Related to the Province of Pennsylvania attributed to William Penn in 1684. Described is an earthfast, hewn frame \\"filled in\\" (half-timbered) with riven clapboards for the siding, roofing and loft flooring. The author called this a \\"first house\\" distinguishing that it is suitable until such time a better house can be built and then this building can be used as an outbuilding: > To build then, an House of thirty foot long and eighteen foot broad, with a > partition near the middle, and an other to divide one end of the House into > two small rooms, there must be eight Trees about sixteen Inches square, and > cut off, to Posts of about fifteen foot long, which the House must stand > upon, and four pieces, two of thirty foot long, and two of eighteen foot > long, for Plates, which must lie upon the top of those Posts, the whole > length and breadth of the House for the Gists [joists] to rest upon.

Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Historical Society. > 329-342. Print. Earthfast construction is still used for buildings and structures such as in pole building framing and stilt houses. =Log building= Log building is the second most common type of carpentry in American history. In some regions and periods it was more common than timber framing. There are many different styles of log carpentry: (1) where the logs are made into squared beams and fitted tightly. This style is typical of defensive structures called a blockhouse. The walls needed to be thick and strong and not have gaps in- between; (2) Round logs are left spaced apart, often with the gaps filled with a material called chinking; (3) Planked log buildings have the wall timbers shaped into rectangular thus called planks and plank houses. The C. A. Nothnagle Log House, located in Gibbstown, New Jersey, was constructed in 1638 and is believed to be the oldest surviving log house in what is today the United States. The house was built by colonial settlers in what was then the Swedish colony of New Sweden.OLDEST - Log House in North America - Superlatives on Waymarking.com =Balloon framing= Balloon framing originated in the American Mid-west near Chicago in the 1830s. It is a rare type of American historic carpentry which was exported from America. Balloon framing is very important in history as the beginning of the transition away from the centuries-long method of timber framing to the common types of wood framing now in use. =Corner post construction= Corner post construction is known by many names listed below, but particularly as pi√®ce sur pi√®ce and it blurs the line between timber framing and log building. This type of carpentry has a frame with horizontal beams or logs tenoned into slots or mortises in the posts. Pi√®ce sur pi√®ce en coulisse: Literally piece on piece in a groove is a widespread type of carpentry which blurs the lines between log, plankwall and framing techniques, thus is classified as any of the above. \\"The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age.\\"Dell Upton, John Michael Vlach. Common places: Readings in American Vernacular Architecture, referencing V. Gordon Childe, The Bronze Age, NY, Macmillan, 1930, pp. 206-8 Examples also persist in southern Sweden, in the Alps, Hungry, Poland, Denmark, and Canada. Usually the origin of corner post construction is credited to the immigrants of the far-Eastern French in Canada and Alpine- Alemannic Germans or Swiss in the U. S.Jordan, Terry. \\"Alpine, Alemannic, and American Log Architecture\\", Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 70(1980), pp. 154-80 This technique is best known in German as standerbohlenbau or bohlenstanderbau. Horizontal wood pieces (poles, beams, planks) tenoned into grooves in posts. This type of construction allows shorter timbers to be used and a building can be extended an indefinite length by adding more bays, typically measuring ten feet. Similar methods of construction are found in most if not all Viking settled regions and was common in Scandinavia. It is one of the earliest building types of French- Canada used extensively by the Hudson's Bay Company for trading posts across Canada. It became a common, widespread building method in Canada. Other French names reflect the shape of wood (bois) used between the posts such as planche en coulisse, madriers-, or pieux-. Also recorded in French as bois en coulisse, poteaux en coulisse, madriers en coulisse, poteaux entour√©es de pieux, charpente entour√©e de madriers, poteaux entour√©es de madriers, en poteaux et close de pieux, en pieux sur pieux. (Lessard and Vilandr√© 1974:117) and ‚Äúpiece-sur-piece de charpente‚Äú (French Canadian). Piece sur piece literally means piece on piece and also describes log building with notched corners or any kind of stacked construction. Used in the United States predominantly in early French forts and settlements along the Mississippi River, though examples also occur in other states including Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Wyoming, Maryland, and Michigan where the it is the construction method of oldest house in the state (Navarre-Anderson Trading Post, 1789). A particularly interesting example is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction, the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic featuresNancy S.

Germany),. The Norman French were credited with the introduction of this building technique to Canada, though this technique is found in northwest Europe, the Alps to Hungry. It was used in Pennsylvania and North Carolina by German immigrants. There are many names for corner post construction in many languages: * French: Pi√®ce sur pi√®ce poteaux et pi√®ce coulissante (piece on piece sliding in a groove) Pi√®ce sur pi√®ce en coulisse, poteaux et piece coulissante, pieces sur pieces, * German, (Southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria): blockstanderbau, standerblockbau, st√§nderbohlenbau (post plank construction), bohlenst√§nderbau (plank post construction) * Polish: sumikowo-latkowej (planks sumiki, sumikami, palcami, post latki) * English: Corner-post log construction, corner post construction, corner posting technique, post cornering, vertical-post log construction, post and log, post and panel, Red River frame, Hudson's Bay style, Hudson's Bay corners, Rocky Mountain frame, Manitoba Frame, ‚ÄúM√©tis‚Äù style, the ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù style, slotted post construction, panel construction, section panel, running mortise and tenon (or tongue) * Swedish: Sleppvegg (slip wall?), skiftesverk (shift work) * Danish: bulhus (bole house which means plank house) * Spanish: a ritti e panconi An example of corner post construction is the Cray House in Stevensville, Maryland. =Plank-frame houses= Plank-frame house construction has a timber frame with the walls made of vertical planks attached to the frame. These houses may simply be called plank houses. Some building historians prefer the term plank-on-frame. Plank-frame houses are known from the 17th century with concentrations in the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The carpentry consists of a timber frame with vertical planks extending from sill to plate. Sometimes there are studs at the doors but mostly the vertical planks replace the studs. Both wood shingle or clapboard exterior siding and interior lath and plaster attach directly to the planks.Garvin, James L.. A building history of northern New England. Hanover: University Press of New England, 2001. 21. Print. Some examples of plank frame houses are the oldest house in New Hampshire, the Richard Jackson House, Thomas and Esther Smith House in Massachusetts. =Palisade construction= Beauvais-Amoureux House in Ste Genevieve, MO A palisade is a series of vertical pales (stakes) driven or set into the ground to form a fence or barrier. Palisade construction is a palisade or the similar use of timbers set on a sill; an example in England being the original portion of the ancient Greensted Church and the early type of stave church known as a palisade church. It was common for Native Americans and Europeans to build a palisade as part of a fort or to protect a village. Palisade construction is alluded to as a method of building of early dwellings.Kimball, Fiske. Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies and of the Early Republic.

The nature of planting one end of a timber in the ground is called earthfast or post in ground construction which was a common way to build worldwide. A benefit of earthfast construction is the ground holds the posts from swaying which eliminates the need for bracing and anchors the structure to the ground. The French settlers called this carpentry en pieux or poteaux en terreWhiffen, Marcus, and Frederick Koeper. American Architecture. Volume 1: 1607-1860. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1983. 25. Print. and log on end.Dwyer, Charles P. The Economic Cottage Builder: Or, Cottages for Men of Small Means. Buffalo: Wanzer, McKim, 1856. Print. This type of carpentry may not considered framing. The French method of poteaux en terre was different than palisade construction in that the timbers were hewn two sides and spaced slightly apart with the gaps filled with a material called bousillage Palisade construction is similar in concept to vertical plank wall construction. =Vertical Plank wall= Another concept in vertical plank construction is the wooden stave silo: A collection of staves (planks) carefully fitted and ringed with iron bands to resist the load. Vertical plank wall buildings are sometimes also called plank houses. In Australia houses with vertical plank walls are called slab huts and the technique is similar to the American counterpart except in America these buildings may be two stories. Some plank-wall houses or creole cottages in the New Orleans area are called bargeboard\\"New Orleans Bargeboard\\", a blog with several interior photos showing the vertical plank walls or flatboat boardWilson, Samuel, Roulhac Toledano, and Sally Kittredge Evans. New Orleans architecture, volume IV: the Creole faubourgs. Gretna, La.: Pelican Pub. Co., 1974. 42. Print. houses because the vertical planks used to build the walls were reused planks from barges (flatboats) floated down the Mississippi River loaded with cargo and then broken up and the lumber sold. (Note the possibility of confusion with the different carpentry element called a bargeboard). =Stacked plank and stacked board construction= Another carpentry method which is sometimes called plank wall, board wall, plank-on- plank, horizontal plank frame is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by Orson Squire Fowler for octagon houses in his book The Octagon House: A Home for All in 1848. Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842. =Box houses= In Texas and some other areas box houses are known as box and strip houses, the strips are the battens. Over 5,000 relief cottages after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were built using single-wall construction Box houses (boxed house, box frame,Stephen B. Jordan. \\"Houses Without Frames: The Uncommon Technique of Plank Construction\\", Old House Journal vol XXI, n. 3. May/June 1993. 36-41. Print. box and strip,Willard B.

Published by the Texas State Historical Association. piano box, single-wall, board and batten, and many other names) have minimal framing in the corners and widely spaced in the exterior walls, but like the vertical plank wall houses, the vertical boards are structural.Noble, Allen George. Traditional buildings a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007. Print. The origins of boxed construction is unknown. The term box-frame was used in a reconstruction manual in 1868 after the American Civil War.C. Thurston Chase. A Manual on School-houses and Cottages for the People of the South. 1868. Washington: Government Printing Office. 26-28. Print. Box house may also be a nickname for Classic Box or American Foursquare architectural styles in North America, and is also not to be confused with a general type of timber framing called a box frame. A variation on boxed construction is used on the Wesleyan Grove cottage: cottages around Oak Bluffs (Cottage City), Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, are built of vertical, tongue and groove planks without battens usually in a gothic style. This method was ‚Äúinspired by the tent frame construction‚ÄùWeiss, Ellen. City in the woods: the life and design of an American camp meeting on Martha's Vineyard. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. Print. of the original \\"board tents\\" used for Methodist Camp Meetings beginning in 1835. =A-frame buildings= An A-frame building has framing with little or no walls, the rafters join at the ridge forming an A shape. This is the simplest type of framing but has historically been used for inexpensive cottages and farm shelters until the A-frame house was popularized in the 1950s as a style of vacation home in the United States. =Inside-out framing= Inside-out framing has the sheathing boards or planks on the inside of the framing.Vlach, John Michael. Barns. New York: W. W. Norton & Co.;, 2003. 338. Print. This type of structure was used for structures intended to contain bulk materials like ore, grain or coal. =Plank-framed barns= A type of trussed plank frame barn in Sweden is representative of some types in America, the lack of heavy timbers in the framing give it the name plank frame barn. Plank-framed barnsRadford, William A., and Alfred S. Johnson. Framing; a practical manual of approved up-to-date methods of house framing and construction, together with tested methods of heavy timber and plank framing as used in the construction of barns, factories, stores, and public buildings; strength of timbers; and principles of roof and bridge trusses.. Chicago, Ill.: The Radford architectural Co., 1909. Print. are different than a plank- framed house. Plank framed barns developed in the American Mid-West, such as the patente in 1876 (#185,690) by William Morris and Joseph Slanser of La Rue, Ohio, shows (several other patents followed). Sometimes they were also called a joist frame, rib frame and trussed frame barns. Built of a ‚ÄúConstruction in which none of the material used is larger than 2 inches thick.‚ÄùCarter, Deane G., and W. A. Foster. Farm buildings. 3. ed. New York: Whiley and Sons, 1948. Print. rather than solid timbers. The reduction in availability of timber for barn building and experience with scantling framing resulted in the development of this lightweight barn framing using planks (‚Äújoists‚Äù) rather than timbers. Some stated advantages: cheaper, faster, no interior posts needed, use any length lumber, less skill, less lumber (either purchased or self-produced), ‚Äústronger‚Äù, lighter, all lumber can be purchased from a lumber yard, less labor, heavy timber getting scarce. Also, they were often similar to the Jennings barn design of 1879 (patent #218,031) with no tie beam so there were no beams to interfere with a hay fork (horse fork) on a track system (hay carrier) for pitching hay which became popular c. 1877. The gambrel roof shape lends itself to plank truss construction and became the most popular roof type. Plank frame barns were available by mail-order by 1910 from Chicago. Syn joist-frame, Shawver plank-frame and Wing plank-frame. ‚ÄúIn large construction, such as barn framing, there are two general systems, the braced, pin-joint frame, made of heavy timbers, and the plank frame, made up of two inch planking, either in the form of the ‚Äòplank truss‚Äô or the ‚Äòballoon frame.‚Äô‚Äù (Architectural Drawing and Design of Farm Structures, 1915) Types of structural roof carpentry =Timber roof trusses= =Plank framed trusses= A variation of a plank framed truss with metal plate connectors on a pole barn Plank framed truss was the name for roof trusses made with planks rather than timber roof trusses. In the 20th century it was typical for carpenters to make their own trusses by nailing planks together with wood plates at the joints. Today similar trusses are manufactured to engineering standards and use truss connector plates. Types of structural floor carpentry =Single and double floor timber framing= In timber framing a single floor is a floor framed with single set of joists. A double floor is generally used for longer spans and joists, called bridging beams or joists, are supported by other beams called binding beams: the two layers of timbers providing the name double floor. In a double floor there may be two sets of joists, one for the floor above and one for the ceiling below. =Plank and beam construction= Plank and beam construction or framing is a type of framing with no joists but widely spaced beams spanned by heavy planks. This method developed in the early 19th century for industrial mill floors but may also be found in timber framed roofs. Also known as Slow burning construction, mill construction, and heavy timber construction originated in industrial mills in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The joists are eliminated by the use of heavy planks saving time and strength of the timbers because the joists notches were eliminated. The beams are spaced to apart and the planks are or more thick possibly with another layer of on the top as the finished flooring could span these distances. The planks may be laid flat and tongue and grooved or splined together or laid on edge called a laminated floor.Dewell, Henry Dievendorf. Timber framing. San Francisco: Dewey Pub. Co., 1917. 207.

These beams are designed to be self-releasing in case of fire, that is if they burn through and collapse the connection with the masonry wall and joint at the post should allow the beam to fall away without pulling the wall or post down. A common way to join a beam and a masonry wall in this regard is a fire cut, an angled cut on the end of the beam.Brannigan, Francis L., and Glenn P. Corbett.

Wooden bridges Howe trusses of the Hartland Bridge which crosses the Saint John River between Maine and New Brunswick, Canada A timber bridge or wooden bridge is a bridge that uses timber or wood as its principal structural material. One of the first forms of bridge, those of timber have been used since ancient times. Wooden bridges could a deck only structure or a deck with a roof. Wooden bridges were often a single span, but could be of multiple spans. A trestle bridge is a bridge composed of a number of short spans. Each supporting frame is a bent. Timber and iron trestles (i.e. bridges) were extensively used in the 19th century.Walter Loring Webb, Railroad Construction -- Theory and Practice, 6th Ed., Wiley, New York, 1917; Chapter IV -- Trestles, pages 194-226 A covered bridge is a timber-truss bridge with a roof, decking, and siding, which creates a nearly complete enclosure.\\"Covered bridge\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 8 October 2012. The purpose of the covering is to protect the wooden structural members from the weather. Uncovered wooden bridges typically have a lifespan of only 20 years because of the effects of rain and sun, but a covered bridge could last 100 years.\\"Ohio's Vanishing Covered Bridges\\".

It is widespread on islands in Western Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii, and presents combinations of unusual features which make easily recognizable for field workers. These include dirty white shell exterior with deep purple colored interior, operculars colored purple. Opercular plates on each side calcify together in all but youngest individuals, and cannot be separated or easily distinguished from each other. This feature is shared only by Rehderella belyaevi, but in latter species, scutum and tergum can be distinguished by raised ridge replacing old articular margin. Unique feature of Nesochthamalus is its basis. In young individuals, it is entirely membraneous, and with age, becomes secondarily calcareous progressively inwards, leaving only the center membraneous. As the basis calcifies, it rises off the substrate forming a saucer shape when viewed from the side. In addition, interior of shell is secondarily calcified.  Diagnosis and Discussion  Nesochthamalus intertextus is notable and distinctive in its outer shell and basis structure. General shape is flattened, with relatively large oval aperture. Crowded colonies do not become columnar, as in Chamaesipho. Unworn specimens are dirty white, and show vertical ribbing, prominent growth ridges, and wavy or chevroned sutures between shell plates. Because of its intertidal habitat, most specimens are eroded, particularly in their upper, older portions. As wear progresses, plate sutures become straighter. Interior of shell is colored deep violet, more intensely at plate sutures. This color only shows on exterior on unworn sections between ribs. Interior surface of shell plates is covered in small pits. In young specimens, basis is entirely membraneous. As the animal grows, basis calcifies progressively inwards, leaving only central portion membraneous. As this happens, layers of secondary calcareous material form on inside of shell. This secondary calcification and basis are also colored purple, and serve to halt further enlargement of shell size. As calcification proceeds, outer parts of the animal are raised off substrate, showing convex, saucer-shaped side view. Opercular plates are unusual in being completely fused on each side, with no trace left of scutal/tergal articulation, except in youngest individuals. Where scutum and tergum are separable, they are equal in size, and colored deep violet, with tergum darker than scutum. Tergum shows clear spur, and 4 tergal depressor muscle crests. Otherwise, these plates are nearly featureless, except for numerous pits on inside surface. = Synonymy and Nomenclature =  Nesochthamalus  * Nesochthamalus , 1987: 326, (Original Description): , 2006: 75, (discussion). * Type species: Chthamalus intertextus , 1854: 467, by original designation.

Dancing songs are the most common type of traditional Tuvaluan song, with other tradition dance styles including fakanau and fakaseasea. The fatele, in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012. Te titi tao is a traditional skirt placed upon another skirt - a titi kaulama - and tops (teuga saka), headbands, armbands, and wristbands continue to be used in performances of the fatele. The modern Tuvaluan style has absorbed many influences and can be described \\"as a musical microcosm of Polynesia, where contemporary and older styles co-exist\\". The traditional fatele The traditional fatele was performed in the sitting or kneeling position by five or six young unmarried women, who while singing, moved their arms, hand and upper body; the men and women act as the chorus. The most popular form of Tuvaluan dance music in the modern era is the fatele, which is influenced by European melody and harmony and is competitive, with each island divided into two sides. Lyricism is an important part of the fatele tradition, which begins with the older men singing a song in a meeting hall (maneapa), then gradually repeating it louder and quicker as the others join in; they also use empty cabin cracker cans or wooden boxes, such as tea chests to beat the rhythm. The influences on the development of modern fatele A Tuvaluan dancer at Auckland's Pasifika Festival The influence of the Samoan missionaries sent to Tuvalu by the London Missionary Society from the 1860s resulted in the suppression of songs about the traditional religions or magic. The swaying in rhythmic dances was considered erotic by missionaries and most traditional dancing was forbidden, along with restrictions on traditional religious activity as these dances served a spiritual purpose as well. As the influence of the missionaries diminished in the 20th century the siva dance tradition from Samoa became popular and influence the development of the modern fatele. The Samoan dance focuses on the individual dancers who have space in which to perform the steps and arm, hand and body movements of the Samoan siva dance tradition. In 1960-1961 Gerd Koch, an anthropologist, made recordings of traditional songs on the atolls of Niutao, Nanumaga and Nukufetau. These songs were considered in a 1964 musicological publication, with a selection of the songs published in 2000 as Songs of Tuvalu together with two CDs of the recorded songs. The performances of fatele that were recorded by Gerd Koch would have been influenced by the missionaries, although Gerd Koch worked with the older members of the communities in order to identify and record music that predated the influence of the missionaries. The modern fatele The modern fatele involves the women on their feet, dancing in lines; with the men facing the dancers, sitting on the floor beating the time with their hands on the mats or on wooden boxes. The dancers enact the story being retold, and the music finally climaxes and ends abruptly. The festivities, including church festivals and weddings, at which the fatele are performed can go on for hours. The fatele tradition is shared with the music of Tokelau.

While her formal professional career ended upon her marriage, she contributed as a citizen scientist, volunteering for the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). The Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory was supported by donations from her family and is named in her honor.  Life  Phoebe Waterman Haas was born in North Dakota, United States, in 1882, as Emma Phoebe Waterman. Her father was John Charles Waterman. Initially taught at home by her parents, she later went to Grand Rapids, Michigan, to study at High School. = Education and early work = Star Spectroscope, Lick Observatory, constructed by Brashear, 1898 Phoebe Waterman moved from North Dakota to New York to study at Vassar College, a university for women, where she received a BA degree in 1904. Two years later she earned a master's degree in Mathematics and Astronomy, working with Caroline E. Furness. At the time, the accepted way for a woman to be professionally involved in the field of astronomy was to be a \\"computer\\", performing data analysis and making calculations. As a computer at Mount Wilson Observatory from 1909 to 1911, Phoebe worked with leading astronomers such as George Ellery Hale, Walter S. Adams, Jacobus Kapteyn, and Harold D. Babcock. She was involved in classification and reduction of spectra and measurement of laboratory spectra. She also studied the rotation of the Sun. Phoebe wanted to be a full professional research astronomer, making her own observations as well as doing analyses. In 1911 she applied to the University of California-Berkeley to a doctorate program. She was accepted and was able to make observations at Lick Observatory in San Jos√©, using the Brashear spectrograph on the 36-inch refractor for her research. She was awarded a doctorate of philosophy in Astronomy on May 14, 1913,. Her thesis title was \\"The Visual Region of the Spectrum of the Brighter Class A Stars.\\" She was the first women in earn a doctorate in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley. (Waterman's dissertation was published before that of her classmate, Anna Estelle Glancy, who was awarded her degree on the same day.) = Marriage = In 1913, Phoebe was appointed as an assistant to the Argentine National Observatory at Cordoba, Argentina. On the ship traveling to Buenos Aires she met chemist Otto Haas. They were married on February 22, 1914. They had two children: Fritz Otto and John C. Haas. =AAVSO work= For many years, Phoebe was an observer, volunteer and benefactor of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). The AAVSO, founded in 1911, was an organization which fostered collaboration between citizen scientists and professionals. John Crane willed his 4-inch Clark refractor to the AAVSO. After he died in 1927, Phoebe Waterman Haas was able to obtain it. She reported her observations of variable stars to the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), submitting 338 observations from 1928 to 1933. She also taught her children and friends about astronomy. In 1953, the AAVSO separated from Harvard College Observatory, losing both its physical location and much of its funding. Phoebe Waterman Haas volunteered to assist the AAVSO Director, Margaret Mayall. For the next eleven years, Haas provided vital support by calculating the five- or ten-day means for southern variable stars. Her data formed the basis for light curves published by AAVSO. She and her family also contributed financially in support of the AAVSO. Phoebe Waterman Haas died in 1967.  Legacy  In 1945, following World War II, Phoebe and Otto Haas created the Phoebe Waterman Foundation to help fatherless children and to support medical and educational institutions. Otto Haas himself had had to work at the age of 15 after the death of his father. The foundation was later renamed the William Penn Foundation. The Rohm and Haas company yearly presents an award in Phoebe Haas' name. The Phoebe Waterman Haas Award is given to a woman, nominated by her peers, who demonstrates outstanding leadership and serves as role model inside and outside the company. = Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory = The observatory of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. was named the Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory in recognition of a USD$6 million donation from the Thomas W.

Life It has been inferred that he was the son of George Aglionby, who was tutor to William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire from 1629, and who married Sibella Smith in 1635, dying in 1643. He had an M.D. degree from the University of Bordeaux. Fluency in French later caused him trouble when claiming to be English in France. Aglionby was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1667.Royal Society database, Aglionby; William (c 1642 ‚Äì 1705). From 1669 to 1671 he acted as tutor for Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet and then for Robert Paston, 1st Earl of Yarmouth. In 1679 he was secretary to Sir William Temple at The Hague. During the 1680s Aglionby was in practice in London as a physician. He was based in Broad Street, and was licensed by the Royal College of Physicians in 1687. At this period he took an active part in the Royal Society. In 1698 Aglionby was attempting to negotiate a postal treaty with the French Farmer-General of Posts, in Calais. Other diplomatic postings were to Madrid, Turin and Zurich. Aglionby's associates included James Brydges, Abraham Hill, and Matthew Prior. Works Aglionby's major work was Painting Illustrated in Three Diallogues (1685). It has been described as the first original English book of its kind, based on the theory that Italian history painting was the leading genre of art; it contained eleven biographies of Italian painters. Aglionby used Giorgio Vasari's Lives, but selectively, and imposing his own views. He began with lives of Cimabue and Giotto, interpolating in the series then a dialogue on the history of painting. There followed: Leonardo da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto, Raphael, Giorgione, Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Pierino del Vaga, Titian and Donatello. Other sources used include Gian Pietro Bellori and Carlo Cesare Malvasia. Dismissive of Nicolas Poussin, Aglionby mentions favourably if not at length four artists from northern Europe: D√ºrer, Holbein, Rubens, Van Dyck. The two latter were among the 12 Vite of Bellori, from which he borrows heavily. From a nationalistic point of view, Aglionby pointed to a revival of the arts at the Restoration of 1660, and promoted the painter John Riley, and the sculptor Grinling Gibbons. As apologetics for English art, which had not contributed to history painting, he argued for its success in portrait painting.

The Sons of Neptune began to defend themselves against trade restrictions imposed by the British. They were involved in the Stamp Act Crisis, the Townsend Acts, and the Boston Tea Party. The term \\"Sons of Liberty\\" was used in America prior to 1765 by Colonel Isaac Barr√©, who coined the phrase \\"Sons of Liberty\\" for those whose rights were threatened by Lord Grenville's proposed stamp tax. This group of patriots was formed in New York by Isaac Sears.  French and Indian War  When the French and Indian War began, Sears acquired the title of captain and commanded vessels to help the British triumph. Privateering proved to be an important instrument of social mobility and a solid financial base for radical leaders. Men like Sears, who commandeered trades at sea, played influential roles in the. During the war with the French, the privateer's primary role was to attack enemy raiders both on land and sea. The enemy would be located primarily around the waters of northern Delaware to southern Virginia. These privateers took bounty from pillaged ships. The only time they would not dare attack was if they faced French warships. After the war, Sears moved to New York and engaged in trade with the West Indies.  Stamp Act in New York  The Stamp Act was proposed in 1765 by Britain. Protests immediately began, starting in New York. This colony was different from the rest because it was not recognized by the British crown as having the same rights and privileges as the others, which were composed of Englishmen. New York was founded by colonists from the Netherlands and they did not enjoy the same rights as other colonists. The Englishman's rights came from the Magna Carta, which limited the King's powers and protected the rights of citizens. When the British acquired New York, their justification as well as the king's for limiting the rights of non-Englishmen was prejudice. Because of this thinking, a violent struggle preceded the American Revolution. The limited rights given by the King made the New York colony dissatisfied. The King viewed this colony as a conquered people that he could rule as he saw fit. Hundreds of seamen were out of work. New Yorkers gathered in the streets to protest the Stamp Act. At one point demonstrators threatened to break into the fort where the province's octogenarian lieutenant governor, Cadwallader Colden and a small contingent of soldiers stood uneasy guard over the hated tax stamps. Sears and many other merchants were trying to find a solution to end the crisis. Sear's eagerness to influence and persuade the public thrust him into the position of leader. He spread posters around the city signed \\"Sons of Neptune\\" that warned that an assault would be made on the British fort unless the Stamps were surrendered by Governor Colden to the people. Within 24 hours Colden surrendered the stamps. New York's tough stance stopped the tax, once the governor of New York described the situation to the King.

In particular its group-like elements are (essentially) the homomorphisms from A to B. Measuring coalgebras were introduced by . Definition A coalgebra C with a linear map from C√óA to B is said to measure A to B if it preserves the algebra product and identity (in the coalgebra sense). If we think of the elements of C as linear maps from A to B, this means that c(a1a2) = Œ£c1(a1)c2(a2) where Œ£c1‚äóc2 is the coproduct of c, and c multiplies identities by the counit of c.

On this way he installed one part of the idol of Lord Mahadeva in this sacred land thereby he reached late at Rameswaram. Due to Lord Anjaneya's belated arrival, Lord Sree Rama installed Lord Mahadeva's idol made in clay and imparted the remaining life force to the clay idol situating in Dhanushkodi. Because of the immense blessing power and the importance of this land Gods and Saints worshipped the idol of Lord Mahadeva in this place and in Kaliyuga about six of the Brahmin families constructed the main Sanctum Sanctorum of Lord Mahadeva in this place and worshipped him in three different forms- Lord Dakshina Murthi in the morning, Lord Kiratha Murthi at noon and Lord Uma Maheswar in the evening. Lately because of the negligence of fostering and foreign invasion many part of the temple had been destroyed and during 1980s the families of the temple trustees and local devotees started the renovation works of this temple.

The film details the events leading up to the death of Kurt Cobain, as seen through the perspective of Tom Grant, the private detective who was hired by Courtney Love to find Cobain, shortly before his death in 1994. It also explores the conspiracy theory that Cobain's death was not a suicide. The film stars Tyler Bryan as Cobain and Daniel Roebuck as Grant, with Sarah Scott portraying Courtney Love and August Emerson as Dylan Carlson. Synopsis The film provides a look at inconsistencies in the death of Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of the American grunge band Nirvana, as seen through the perspective of former private investigator Tom Grant. In addition to the dramatization of Cobain's final days, the film combines documentary footage as well as interviews with people associated with the case such as former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper and the American forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht. Grant's own recorded conversations with key figures such as Rosemary Carroll, Cobain and Love's attorney and Dylan Carlson ‚Äî who purchased the 20-gauge Remington Model 11 Sportsman shotgun ‚Äî are also prominently featured. Production Soaked in Bleach marks the directorial debut of Benjamin Statler, who co-wrote and produced the films Act of Valor and Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope. The title, \\"Soaked in Bleach\\", derives from a lyric off the Nirvana song \\"Come as You Are\\". Reception The film has a 50/100 rating on Metacritic based on seven reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 30% rating based on 10 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the film \\"may be TMI for those not already obsessed with all things Cobain\\", but it presents enough evidence to counter its dismissal as a conspiracy theory. Zack Sigel wrote for VH1 that the film presents \\"Flimsy evidence, personal agendas, and blatant disregard for facts\\". IndieWire's review claimed cinematographer Ben Kutchins \\"heavily studied David Fincher‚Äôs unsung procedural masterpiece\\" _Zodiac,_ noting that the \\"testimonies [and] audio recordings made by Grant\\" were \\"dramatically recreated like a made-for-TV version [of Fincher‚Äôs film].\\" Controversy Prior to the release of the docu drama, cold case homicide Detective Michael Ciesynski was instructed to look at the 35mm film photographs of the Kurt Cobain death scene as part of a re- examination, marking the 20th anniversary of the musician's passing. The Seattle Police Department released those photographs in March 2014. Ciesnyski told KIRO-TV that \\"the new work on the case turned up nothing to make him think Cobain's death was anything but what it was ruled to be in 1994 - a suicide\\". New images of the Remington shotgun were also released later in March of 2016, refuting the claim made in the movie that the Seattle Police Department gave Courtney Love the shotgun for melting it down. A police report referred instead to other guns confiscated by the police. On June 17, 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that Courtney Love had sent cease and desist letters against theaters showing Soaked in Bleach claiming, \\"A false accusation of criminal behavior is defamatory ‚Ä¶ which entitles Ms. Cobain to both actual and presumed damages\\". The letter also states \\"We hereby demand again that you immediately cease any and all plans for exhibition or promotion of the film. If we do not hear from you within five days, we are required to immediately pursue all available civil legal remedies on behalf of our client against you.\\" To date no lawsuit has been filed on Love's behalf. The producers of the film responded to the letters by stating, \\"Courtney Love's uninformed accusations and efforts to discredit the film are totally off base. Courtney Love and her lawyers clearly don't like that the film presents a compelling case for re-opening the investigation into Kurt's death. They should respect the First Amendment and let people decide for themselves.\\" John Fisk, paramedic for the Seattle Fire Department and first responder at the Kurt Cobain death scene in 1994, gave an interview to the Mercer Island Reporter on April 6, 2016 stating that \\"he reiterated to the Soaked in Bleach producers that he still believes the case remains a suicide.\\" On June 27, 2016, Vernon J. Geberth, former homicide detective of the New York City Police Department, who was among the experts interviewed in the docudrama, posted an article on his Practical Homicide Investigation website and Facebook page, stating that he \\"was not happy that the producers of Soaked in Bleach made it appear that he agreed with their homicide theory\\". He stated further that he \\"made it quite clear that he believed that Kurt Cobain took his own life and backed up his opinion with the facts that he had obtained from the Seattle Police Department's Homicide Division coupled with his own experience with suicide cases\\". Carole Chaski, a forensic linguist, agreed with the official suicide verdict. She was as well among the experts shown in Soaked in Bleach. On October 9, 2017, she was interviewed at the NBC News affiliate House Of Mystery Radio Show, stating that her \\"results do not support the conspiracy theory that Courtney Love authored the bottom portion to make it look like a suicide note\\". She ran Kurt Cobain's suicide note through a computational software called SNARE (Suicide Note Assessment Review) and it was classified as a suicide note (the top portion and the bottom portion).

Following a pair of elections that resulted in the town of Checotah being designated as the new county seat, the people of Eufaula refused to hand over the county records. As a result, a group of heavily armed men from Chectotah attempted to seize the records, but were forced to surrender during the gunbattle that ensued. One year later, after another close election, Eufaula became the permanent county seat. The war During the settling of the Western United States, conflicts frequently arose between neighboring towns when they were competing for the county seat. Most of Oklahoma's \\"county seat wars\\", as they were called, were concluded without bloodshed, and involved little more than heated words and close elections. The situation in McIntosh County, however, ended up being much more serious. McIntosh County was established at statehood in 1907, when the population was 17,975. Before then, the area had been part of the Eufaula District of the Creek Nation. On the afternoon of January 9, 1907, the territorial government in Guthrie, sent a telegram to Checotah stating that the legislative committee had selected the town as the temporary seat of McIntosh County, until an election could be held to decide new a permanent location. The people of Checotah were very happy with the surprising news, since being selected as the temporary county seat meant having a better chance of becoming the permanent one in the upcoming election. The whole town celebrated; citizens danced in the streets, church bells rang, and shopkeepers passed out cigars. A street scene in Checotah around 1900. Their good fortune soon turned into disappointment, however, when a Eufaula attorney and delegate to the constitutional convention named William C. Liedtke heard of the news. Liedtke delivered a \\"rousing\\" speech in support of Eufaula to the general assembly on January 17, and called for a vote to decide the matter. The subsequent tally recorded that Eufaula had received forty-two votes, and Checotah forty-one. As a result, and in spite of the telegram and the celebration in Checotah a few days before, Eufaula was designated as the new temporary county seat. A two-story building on the northeast corner of Main Street and Riley Avenue was then rented for use as a courthouse, and the county records were moved there. Unsurprisingly, the people of Checotah were not very happy with the decision and protested, but they soon quieting down and began focusing on the upcoming special election. The people of Eufaula did the same, as did the people of Stidham, which is located about eight miles northwest of Eufaula. \\"Boosters\\" from all three actively campaigned for their towns over the following months. The special election was held on May 23, 1908. The preliminary count reported that Checotah had received 1,647 votes, Eufaula about 1200, and Stidham 384. Since Checotah received sixty-three votes more than the combined totals of the other two towns, it was assumed to be the winner. When the election was over, the ballot boxes were delivered to Guthrie for confirmation. Soon after, the people of Eufaula complained that heavy rains prevented over 300 of their supporters from reaching the polls. The rain was so bad that the noted poet and Creek leader Alexander Posey drowned in the nearby Canadian River. As the results were being confirmed in Guthrie, a problem arose with some sixty-five ballots that were referred to as \\"unaccounted for.\\" Ultimately, the problem cast doubts on the legitimacy of the entire election and created a controversy about the propriety of the earlier count, which reported that Checotah was the winner. At the beginning of June 1908 the attorneys representing Eufaula's campaign obtained a hearing with Chief Justice Robert L. Williams of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and convinced him to issue a temporary injunction, preventing anybody from removing the county offices in Eufaula, until \\"certain alleged discrepancies\\" were resolved. One Guthrie newspaper described the situation: \\"Checotah has a tail-hold and a down-hill pull but Eufaula has a bull-dog grip in the flank, and will hold on until the [county] offices are moved.\\" =The Battle of Eufaula= The Foley Building in 1907. The bottom half of the building was occupied by the First National Bank, while the top half was used as a hotel. The fighting occurred at the intersection in front of the building, and \\"General\\" Dunlap was killed on the third floor. W. Frank Jones was a former deputy US marshal who lived in Checotah and one of the major \\"boosters\\" for his town in the county seat contest. According to Ken Butler, author of More Oklahoma Renegades, when the people of Checotah heard that the Eufaula attorneys had blocked the county offices from being moved to their town, \\"there was a swell of support to take up arms\\" and take by force what they felt was theirs. On Sunday morning, June 7, 1908, a \\"squad\\" of about twenty- five heavily armed men under the command of Frank Jones boarded a special train in Checotah and rode the fifteen miles south to Eufaula. After arriving in town at about noon, the men split up into two groups. From the depot the smaller group marched north and found Edward C. Julian, who had the keys to the county offices. The other larger group, which was personally led by Jones and consisted of about fifteen men, headed straight for the town's main intersection of Foley Avenue and Main Street, which offered a commanding view of the courthouse. While marching there, two Eufaula deputy city marshals named Kelser and F. M. Woods briefly confronted Jones, who told them \\"to get off the streets, else they would get the contents of his gun.\\" Kelser and Woods backed off, but then went around to warn the other Eufaula men in town, most of whom were on their way home from church. Within a short amount of time, several Eufaula men had armed themselves to face off with Jones and his raiders. The owner of a local hardware store passed out guns to those who did not have weapons of their own. The first casualty in the ensuring battle was Marshal Woods, who was mortally wounded by Special Deputy Sheriff Joe Parmenter. Parmenter struck Woods three times, but was then fired on and hit twice as he was trying to take cover behind a water trough. According to Butler, around the same time word was sent to the home of the Grant Johnson, an African-American policeman in Eufaula and former deputy US marshal, asking for his help. When Johnson arrived in Eufaula from his home two miles outside of town, he was greeted by the defenders, who were happy to have a former deputy US marshal on their side. Johnson and Jones had once worked together as officers of the law, so when Johnson saw the other he asked for him to surrender. Jones, who had mutual respect for his former fellow officer and could see that his men were already outnumbered by the growing Eufaula force, agreed to negotiate. Ken Butler says that Jones had to do \\"a lot of coaxing\\" to get his men to lay down their arms and give up the records they had taken, but he eventually succeeded. The disappointed raiders were then taken prisoner and loaded onto a train to be sent home, some eight hours after having arrived in Eufaula. The first deputy US marshals to serve in the Northern District of the Indian Territory, including Frank Jones (standing, 10th from left) and Grant Johnson (sitting, 3rd from left) in 1897. The following was written by W. R. Withington, a telephone operator who witnessed the fighting, for The Chronicles: Shortly after the train of Checotah men pulled out of town, a former deputy US marshal named \\"General\\" Dunlap decided to seek out and arrest the county clerk, Edward C. Julian, who was suspected of collaborating with Jones and his raiders. Dunlap, who was reported to have been drinking before attempting to make the arrest, then headed for the hotel in the Foley Building, which is located at the same intersection the Checotah raiders had occupied. Dunlap soon found Julian's room on the third floor, but the latter was ready for any trouble. Julian heard suspicious noises outside his door before Dunlap knocked on it. Julian answered the door, and although it is not known what words were exchanged between the two men, within seconds they were shooting at one another. The shootout, which was fought at point-blank range, was over in just a few seconds. Dunlap was mortally wounded, having been hit in the forehead by one of Julian's bullets. Julian managed to get away unharmed. =The final election= Frank Jones In all, two men were killed and the wounded Joe Parmenter recovered. Frank Jones was also criticized for having failed to complete his mission. About two weeks after the clash, Governor Charles N. Haskell announced his findings of the McIntosh County special election. Haskell reported that 3,284 votes had been cast at the polls on May 23, 1908, and that more of the voters preferred Checotah over Eufaula and Stidham combined. It made no difference, though. An appeal was pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court and an injunction to forestall the removal of the county offices from Eufaula had been issued. Ultimately, it was decided that a new special election would have to be held in order to resolve the controversy once and for all. In January 1909, shortly after the state legislature convened, a freshman senator named Richard A. Billups from Cordell related a story of the county seat election held on January 17, 1907. Billups said that when the senate called for a vote, he illegally cast a vote in his friends name in favor of Eufaula. Upon hearing of the story, Senator Harry Beeler of Checotah, who had supplied Jones with the special train on June 7, 1908, realized that Billups' illegal ballot was the one that had given Eufaula the one-point margin in the January 1907 election, and that Billups was therefore responsible for the resulting controversy and bloodshed. However, when Billups realized what he had done, he quickly recanted his entire story, and said he was merely joking about the whole thing. Billups' story was still being discussed when the final special election took place on February 10, 1909. Only Eufaula and Checotah were in the race. Eufaula received 1,919 votes and Checotah 1,844, but this time the results were not contested, and Eufaula has been the seat of McIntosh County ever since. Aftermath Both Joe Parmenter and Edward C. Julian were arrested for murder, but neither were convicted. Julian went back to his old job within a year after the shootout, and Parmenter was acquitted in June 1909. Frank Jones went back to his home in Checotah and years later wrote a book about his adventures while serving as a lawman in Oklahoma. The book, which was titled: The Experiences of a Deputy U.S. Marshal of the Indian Territory, discusses many of Jones' experiences during his long career as a lawman, as well as other adventures after his retirement, but it makes no mention of the McIntosh County Seat War. In July 1925, the old courthouse in Eufaula burned down and was rebuilt into a one- story building. Many of the county records that the two factions had fought for were lost to the flames. The current McIntosh County Courthouse was built two years later in 1927. On April 14, 1988, the Eufaula Business District, which includes the Foley Building, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior.

Early in his career he performed with The Clancy Brothers. , he is a member of the group The High Kings. Birth and family Finbarr Clancy was the only son born to folk musician Bobby Clancy and Moira Mooney in County Tipperary, Ireland. Bobby Clancy, who was touring with the Clancy Brothers at the time, announced Finbarr's birth on David Frost's television talk show. Finbarr is the nephew of the popular folk singers, Liam Clancy, Paddy Clancy, and Tom Clancy, who helped to spark the Irish folk music revival of the 1960s. Like the Clancy Brothers, he grew up in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary. Finbarr has sometimes performed with his sister, folk singer Aoife Clancy, and his brother-in-law, Welsh singer Ryland Teifi (the husband of his sister, Roisin). He married Gr√°inne Butler in 2008. Early career Clancy made his debut at age ten, playing the banjo and singing. In the mid-1990s, he toured the United States and Ireland with the Clancy Brothers. He sang and played 5 string banjo, electric bass and flute with the group, which consisted at the time of Bobby, Paddy, and Liam Clancy and Finbarr's cousin, singer-songwriter Robbie O'Connell. As part of this group, Finbarr appeared in the Clancy Brothers' filmed \\"Farewell to Ireland\\" performance in early 1996, which has since been released on DVD. Later in 1996, after Liam Clancy and Robbie O'Connell left the band, Clancy began touring with his father, uncle Paddy, and American musician Eddie Dillon in the final Clancy Brothers line-up.

Influence as editors and commentators The father and son are best known for editing and providing commentaries on the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. They are often grouped with Zhang Zhupo and Jin Shengtan as commentator/editors whose (ËÆÄÊ≥ï lit. \\"way to read\\") interpreted novels using a vocabulary and critical standards which up to then had been limited to poetry and painting. This innovation raised the status of fiction for Chinese readers and made the writing of fiction into a respectable activity for educated people. The Maos' substantially revised text, first published in 1679 (1680 in the western calendar), was so successful that it drove earlier versions from the market and for nearly three centuries was the only one which most Chinese readers knew. Their commentaries, or (how to read), explained the moral and historical issues in the novel. These not only shaped reader reactions but also helped to establish fiction as acceptable to serious readers rather than frivolous or even illicit. Although their edition of Three Kingdoms was published under and is known by Mao Zonggang's name, scholars assume that Mao Lun was primarily responsible.Andrew West, The Textual History of Sanguo Yanyi The Mao Zonggang Recension, based on the author's \\"Quest for the Urtext: The Textual Archaeology of The Three Kingdoms\\" (PhD Dissertation, Princeton University, 1993), and his ‰∏âÂúãÊºîÁæ©ÁâàÊú¨ËÄÉ Sanguo Yanyi Banben Kao [Study of the Editions of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms] (Shanghai: Shanghai Guji Chubanshe, 1996) Little is known of Mao Lun, though it is understood that he went blind as he entered middle age and relied on his son as his secretary. Mao Lun experienced the Manchu conquest of the lower Yangzi valley in the 1640s and saw friends executed for being loyal to the Ming. Scholars have long debated whether his viewpoint was that of a loyalist who supported Southern Ming remnants, in which case his sympathies might lie with the loyalist group in Three Kingdoms. Editing the Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang edited and significantly altered the text of Ming dynasty editions of the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi novel (), organizing it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi (). They reduced the text from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; cut and supplemented to improve narrative flow; reduced the use of third party poems; replaced conventional verse with finer pieces; and removed most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals.Roberts 1991, pg. 965 Mao Lun did not explain these editorial changes to his readers but claimed that the earlier \\"vulgar edition\\" (suben ‰øóÊú¨) had corrupted the original text. Mao claimed to have found an \\"ancient edition\\" (guben Âè§Êú¨) which embodied the author's true wishes. The scholar Andrew West concludes that \\"there is hardly a line that has not been affected to some degree by Mao Lun's surgical knife.\\" Many of these textual changes, West continues, are \\"insidious in intent, for they quietly realign the reader's interpretation of the central protagonists.\\" That is, there is a question whether readers are to view Liu Bei as legitimate because he was descended from the ruling family of the Han dynasty, though now head of only the Shu state, or whether Cao Cao, leader of the usurping state of Wei, had a greater claim to legitimacy because he was more forceful and competent. Although the earlier text acknowledges the legitimacy of Liu's state of Shu over Cao's state of Wei, the attitude towards Cao Cao is often ambivalent. Mao Lun, on the other hand, is \\"unequivocal in his praise for Liu Bei and his condemnation for Cao Cao.\\" \\"The empire long divided must unite,\\" long understood to be Luo's introduction and philosophy, was actually added by Mao Zonggang and Mao Lun in their substantially revised edition of 1679. None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. The earlier editions, moreover, spend far more time on the bitter process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.Bojun Shen, translated by Kimberly Basio, \\"Studies of Three Kingdoms in the New Century,\\" in Besio and Tong, eds., Three Kingdoms and Chinese Culture, p. 154 After the draft of their Sanguozhi Yanyi was completed in the early 1660s, Mao Lun planned to hand off the manuscript to someone from Nanjing to publish it, but at that point one of Mao Lun's students tried to pass the work as his own. The publication was put on hold because of this, and the first extant Mao edition of the Sanguozhi Yanyi was prefaced 1679, perhaps reflecting the delay that was caused. Editing the Tale of the Pipa In the years between the completion of their recension of the Sanguozhi Yanyi to its publication, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang provided commentary to another work, the Ming play Tale of the Pipa by Gao Ming. In the preface of their edition of the Tale of the Pipa, Mao Lun explained that he had the idea to do a commentary on the play since adolescence, but not until he went blind did he have the leisure to turn that idea into reality. Like what they did for Sanguozhi Yanyi, the Maos present their edition of Tale of the Pipa as a recovered old text, not their own interpretation. In this regard they closely mirror the methodology of their contemporary Jin Shengtan, the commentator of Water Margin and Romance of the Western Chamber. However, unlike Jin's morally subversive commentary, the Maos tend to affirm conventional morality. The Maos interpret the Tale of the Pipa as Gao Ming's vehicle to criticize an acquaintance. This interpretation is noted to be a common one for their time, but not one based on objective evidence. Consequently, the Mao commentary to the Tale of the Pipa was panned by many of their contemporaries like Li Yu and Zhang Zhupo. Notes References and further reading    West, Andrew.

He was sentenced to death and executed by Stalinist officials in Soviet-controlled postwar Poland, on charges of being an enemy spy. Biography Jerzy Zakulski was born to a family of a high-school teacher, Ludwik Zakulski. The Zakulskis settled in Krak√≥w, at St. Kinga Street 7 in the district of Podg√≥rze. Jerzy enrolled at the Jagiellonian University and graduated with a degree in law in 1936. Two years later he passed the bar. On 1 September 1939 Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany.

After Poland's defeat Zakulski joined the underground Military Organization Lizard Union (ZwiƒÖzek Jaszczurczy) due to his prewar contacts in the Organizacja Polska.

Just before the liquidation of the Ghetto in the course of the murderous Operation Reinhard in Krak√≥w under Holocaust perpetrator Amon G√∂th, Maria B≈Çeszy≈Ñska Bernstein escaped from there at night with her three-year-old daughter. They were rescued by Jerzy Zakulski. He engaged his whole family in the rescue mission including his father-in-law Jan Bahr, hiding Maria and her child in both households by turns. Eventually, they took them out of the city to a safer place of a cousin Zofia Strycharska in My≈õlenice. Both Maria and her daughter survived the war and returned to Krak√≥w afterwards. In her letter to the Stalinist military court in Warsaw dated 23 June 1947, Maria, living at 32 D≈Çuga street at the time, insisted that the Zakulskis had all risked their lives to save theirs. =Execution= Monument at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery featuring the commemorative plaque to Jerzy Zakulski on the mass grave of Cursed soldiers executed in Stalinist Poland in 1945‚Äì1956 After the takeover of Krak√≥w by the Red Army, Zakulski continued his clandestine work with the anticommunist Delegatura Si≈Ç Zbrojnych na Kraj, collecting data on the Soviet crime wave and looting of the city. He was betrayed and captured by the security forces a year later along with several others. His trial began on 29 May 1947 in Warsaw and concluded after two weeks on 16 June 1947. A Jewish Holocaust survivor from Krak√≥w, Maria B≈Çeszy≈Ñska n√©e Bernstein, attempted to save Zakulski's life in gratitude for his rescue of her and her daughter during the Holocaust in Poland; however, she was unsuccessful. The certified letter she sent to the Regional Military Court in Warsaw was thrown out, along with his plea for presidential mercy. Zakulski was sentenced to death and shot in prison on 31 July 1947.

The marriage resulted in two children. Schreuder was an officer (Major) in the Austrian army during the French Revolutionary Wars from 1790 up to his death at the Battle of Arcole in 1796. Career Schreuder served as a captain in the Austrian Kaiser Infantry Regiment # 1 from 1790 to 1794.

As the in-house caterer of the Franklin Institute, and an offsite caterer at events across the region, Frog has imagined, planned and executed more than 20,000 events and served over 20 million guests. History = Restaurants = Frog Commissary is the natural offspring of Poses' first restaurant Fr√∂g, which the restaurateur opened in 1973, and The Commissary, which he inaugurated a few years later. Fr√∂g, founded in 1973 at 264 S. 16th Street, was Poses‚Äô first restaurant. The concept was inspired by his experience working at Peter von Starck's French restaurant La Panetiere, the work of Jane Jacobs on the importance of urban renewal, and travels throughout Europe and South America. The name came when Poses‚Äô mother suggested that he call the new place Le Grenouille. Poses chose the English version, Fr√∂g, because it was unpretentious and easy to remember. The umlaut was added over the ‚Äúo‚Äù as a design flourish, to symbolize the eyes of the frog. (The umlaut was later removed when the name Frog carried over to the catering business.) The restaurant struck a chord with young urbanites and quickly became a dining destination that built a needed sense of community. With the need for expansion, Fr√∂g moved to 1524 Locust Street in 1979, going from ‚Äúneighborhood casual to upscale elegant.‚Äù Signature dishes include Three Noodle Appetizer, Vegetarian Chili, Saut√©ed Calf's Liver and Thai Chicken Curry. Frog was cited by Philadelphia Magazine on the occasion of the magazine's 25th anniversary as the ‚ÄúBest Restaurant‚Äù of the past 25 years. In 1977, Poses built on the success of Fr√∂g by opening The Commissary, an informal, 7am to 11pm eatery that had a cafeteria on the first floor and a sit-down restaurant on the second floor. In 1979, The Commissary added one of Philadelphia's first upscale takeout options, The Market at The Commissary, and a Piano Bar. The atmosphere at The Commissary was casual, with a vintage 1946 Indian Chief motorcycle hanging in its two-story front window. During its heyday The Commissary was one of the highest grossing restaurants in America. The 100-seat cafeteria served as many as 1500 people a day. The cafeteria's menu included housemade p√¢tes and caviar. Poses often said, ‚ÄúHardly anyone ordered caviar. But people felt good eating in a cafeteria that offered it.‚Äù The Commissary pioneered housemade pastas, wines by the glass, sushi, house-made ice creams, house-blended and drip decaf coffee ‚Äì unheard of in American and especially local restaurants where decaf was usually a packet of instant Sanka. While Frog offered more expensive options, the atmosphere at The Commissary had a laid-back feel. Among the most legendary items was the carrot cake, which remains a staple in the catering kitchen. The Commissary eventually morphed into the USA Caf√©, serving American Southwest cuisine. Additional restaurants under Poses‚Äô Shooting Star Inc. umbrella included 16th Street Bar and Grill (1981), City Bites (1983) USA Caf√© (1983) and two locations of Eden (1979; 1985). After a 14-year run, Fr√∂g was closed in 1987; the Commissary was closed in 1994, and Poses focused his business on catering. = Catering and Beyond = Frog Commissary Catering was officially launched in 1976, with its first event, a 1,200-person dinner at the unfinished Academy House for the AIA Annual Convention. The party served as a trial by fire‚ÄîPoses has said that naivet√© allowed the company to do great things without worrying about the limitations‚Äîand it was the first of many large events to come. In essence, the company worked to create the experience of a ‚Äútable for two‚Äù times 400, maintaining the high quality food and drink of its smaller ventures. Building on the reputation of Shooting Star Inc. restaurants, Frog Commissary quickly learned to harness the demand for creative events with stylish, memorable food, redefining the parameters of traditional catering through the power of teamwork. In the mid-1980s, the company employed 300 to 400 staff members and served up to 3,000 people a day. At the three-day Jambalaya Jam celebration held on Penn's Landing in 1986, the company fed some 60,000 people without a kitchen. Frog Commissary also catered Philadelphia Orchestra conductor Eugene Ormandy's 80th Birthday and the annual Beaux Arts Balls, in addition to countless weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, galas and other special events. Some notable guests have included Kermit the Frog, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Luciano Pavarotti, Jacqueline Onassis, Barbara Bush, Bill Gates, Lily Tomlin and Liza Minnelli. In 1994, the company opened Noah's Kitchen, a kosher catering division. The same year, Frog Commissary also moved its headquarters to the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Frog Commissary returned to restaurant service, collaborating with a number of local arts institutions to offer better eating options. In 1997, contracts included the Bravo! eatery at the Academy of Music and Bravo! At the Mann Center for the Performing Arts, where the changing lineup of concession stands included Mexican, Thai, Mediterranean, barbecue, pan-Asian and Cuban options. In 2006, Frog Commissary opened the expansive Frog at the Yard dining hall at the Urban Outfitters headquarters at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. In 2010, Frog Commissary moved from its longtime home in Northern Liberties to headquarters at 30-year collaborator the Franklin Institute, where it serves as exclusive caterer. At the Franklin Institute, the company produces private and corporate events in addition to operating the Franklin Foodworks, a family-centered quick-service eatery. Frog Commissary has also created pop-up restaurants at the museum, including Tut's Oasis, and Frog Burger. Poses and Frog Commissary were instrumental in creating the permanent Kitchen Science exhibit at the Franklin Institute, which is part of the Franklin Foodworks and open to the public, and explores the relationship between cooking and science. Frog Commissary has a staff of more than 200 and also caters events offsite across the tri-state area of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.[6]  Impact  Poses is widely considered the leader of the first restaurant renaissance in Philadelphia. In an era where dining was defined by tradition-bound hotel dining rooms, steakhouses and seafood restaurants like Bookbinders, Fr√∂g broke down barriers and created a new kind of experience for a growing influx of young professionals in Center City in the 1970s and 1980s, including an Eating School for exploring new flavors and reading about food. Together with Fr√∂g chef Kamol Phutlek, Poses developed an amalgam of French, Thai and American flavors, which came to be known as ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Cuisine.\\" Baker Anne Clark brought her own contributions in the form of widely popular desserts and pastry like Commissary Carrot Cake and Heart Tarts. Like his contemporaries Alice Waters, Paul Prudhomme, Sheila Lukins, Poses was at the forefront of the New American dining.  Steve Poses  Steve Poses, the company's founder, and chief creative officer, was born in Yonkers, New York. He attended college at the University of Pennsylvania after which he decided to open Frog, his first restaurant in Philadelphia. Inspired by the writings of Jane Jacobs, Poses saw the potential for restaurants to transform city life, in an era when Center City Philadelphia was less than vibrant. Poses earned a coveted spot in the 50 Who‚Äôs Who of Cooking in America. In the late 1970s, Poses launched Frog Commissary Catering. Poses has served on the board of directors at the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance, the Greater Philadelphia First Corporation, the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition, the Mayor's Small Business Council and the Governor's Small Business Council. In addition, he has authored two bestselling[citation needed] cooking primers: Frog Commissary Cookbook and At Home by Steve Poses: A Caterer‚Äôs Guide to Cooking and Home Entertaining.  Christina L. Sterner  Christina Sterner is the CEO of Frog Commissary, Inc.

The speaker is Whitney herself, who is, as the title of the poem indicates, writing to her unfaithful, or inconstant lover. Whitney begins by telling her lover that she has learned he is going to be married, despite his trying this a secret, which the first line explains: \\"as close as you your wedding kept\\". Whitney alternates between speaking as the jilted lover, reminding him what he is missing out on by abandoning her, or acting somewhat as a counsellor and giving him relationship advice. Whitney tells him, \\"you know I alwayes wisht you wel\\", and hopes that God will send him a \\"good wyfe\\"; however, she suggests that if he wanted her back, he could have her. Whitney notes numerous treacherous men from Greek mythology, including Sinon (who persuaded the Trojans to bring the Trojan horse into the city, thus causing the downfall of Troy), Eneas (who abandons his lover Dido), Theseus (who deserted Ariadne), and Jason (who abandoned Medea, after she saves his life on countless occasions). Whitney encourages her lover to be not like these men, but like Troilus, who faithfully died loving Criseyde. After Whitney makes her list of unfaithful men, she addresses the virtues she hopes her lover's wife will have, so that he does not regret his decision. She hopes this wife will have: the beauty of Helen, the chastity of Penelope, the constancy of Lucres, and the true love of Thisbe. Whitney tells her lover that aside from Helen's beauty, she possesses all of these qualities, she only wishes she had Cassandra's gift of prophecy so she could see whether he ends up misfortunate, or she does. Although Whitney clearly feels abandoned, she takes the moral high ground by wishing her lover the best, and offering him relationship advice. She completes her poem, or letter, as a morally virtuous woman, and not a victim. References * The Poetry Foundation * The Facts On File Companion to British Poetry before 1600.

Tuvaluan clothing was traditionally made from Fala leaves (Screw Pine or Pandanus). The material culture of Tuvalu uses traditional design elements in artifacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials. The design of women's skirts (titi) and tops (teuga saka), that are used in performances of the traditional dance songs of Tuvalu, represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design. The collection of the Museum of New Zealand holds Tuvaluan artifacts and handicraft, including a man's jacket and a Mother Hubbard dress made from pandanus leaves that were made following the impact of Christian missionaries who demanded that the women of Tuvalu adopt more conservative clothing as compared to traditional Tuvaluan clothing. The artistry of Tuvaluan handicraft A traditional skirt made of Futu (Barringtonia asiatica) leaves from Nanumea atoll. The women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts decoration of mats, fans and wall hangings that use dyed fibres woven in traditional designs. Crochet (kolose) is one of the art forms practiced by Tuvaluan women. A traditional headband (fau o aliki) or headdress (kula, pale) made out of pandanus, such as those prepared for the inauguration of a chief (aliki) would follow a specific design and the task of creating the headband or headdress is often reserved to a specific person, such as a daughter of the chief. The traditional floral garland of a young woman (Te fou ote tamafine) or a headdress for a woman (fou) would also follow a specific design using tiale (gardenia), pua (guettarda speciosa) and melia (frangipani). Te titi tao is a traditional skirt placed upon another skirt - a titi kaulama - and tops (teuga saka), headbands, armbands, and wristbands continue to be used in performances of the tradition dance music of Tuvalu, such as the fatele. The fatele, in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012. Contemporary dancing skirts (titi) and tops (teuga saka) may still incorporate pandanus leaves, as well as synthetic or natural cloth that is decorated with bold geometric motifs and bold colours. Tuvaluan men also participate in performances of the traditional music in the costumes that follow tradition style that are made from pandanus leaves and synthetic or natural cloth that incorporate bold colours. Marriage ceremonies are usually conducted with men and women in traditional costumes. The material culture of Tuvalu In 1960‚Äì1961 Gerd Koch a German anthropologist, visited the atolls of Nanumaga, Nukufetau and Niutao, which resulted in his publication of a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which described, with illustrations, the design of traditional handicrafts and artifacts. Following the change of name to Tuvalu, the English translation by Guy Slatter was published under the title The Material Culture of Tuvalu. Charles Hedley, a naturalist at the Australian Museum, had earlier written the General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti (1896) which described some uses of the native plants and trees on Funafuti. The churches and community buildings that used for wedding celebrations and community activities (the falekaupule or maneapa) are decorated by the community with the exterior painted with white paint that is known as lase, which is made by burning a large amount of dead coral with firewood. The whitish powder that is the result is mixed with water and painted on the buildings. Contemporary Tuvaluan art and literature Artists with Tuvaluan ancestry in migrant communities, such as the Tuvaluan community in Auckland, New Zealand, produce work using traditional techniques and media and also using modern materials and contemporary Polynesian graphic designs. In 2015 an exhibition of the art of Tuvalu was held on Funafuti, with works that addressed climate change through the eyes of artists and the display of Kope ote olaga (possessions of life), which was a display of the various artefacts of Tuvalu culture. * Lakiloko Keakea was born on Nui, Tuvalu, who now lives in New Zealand. Keakea learnt the practise of 'kolose' (crochet) and began making dresses and 'tiputa' (crochet tops). Keakea became active in Fakapotopotoga Fafine Tuvalu, an art group that taught and promoted the art practices of women from the various islands of Tuvalu. she travelled with the group to the Marshall Islands and learn the techniques of making 'fafetu', a star-shaped woven design. She is a member of Fafine Niutao I Aotearoa ‚Äì the Tuvalu Women's arts collective. * Selina Tusitala Marsh, of SƒÅmoan, Tuvaluan, English and French descent, is a published poet. She represented Tuvalu at the London Olympics Poetry Parnassus event in 2012. Funafuti lagoon (Te Namo) International artists and Tuvalu Vincent Huang=p, a Taiwanese artist, constructed on the reef of Funafuti in 2010 that was designed to raise awareness of the effect of climate change in Tuvalu. He was invited to create the Tuvalu Pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale. In 2014 he had an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei that invited visitors to consider the moral threat climate change presents to Tuvalu. Huang was invited to represent Tuvalu at the 2015 Venice Biennale. He created a turquoise pool crossed by two black walkways. The weight of the people on the walkways results in the pathways sinking into the water causing 'flooding' that symbolically reproduces the impact of global warming on Tuvalu. Huang selected the PVC lining of the pool to reproduce the colour of the \\"beautiful crystal blue of the Tuvalu lagoon\\".

The definition of rape has changed over time from its original formulation in the penal code established in 1871, as extramarital intercourse with a woman by force or the threat. In 1997 laws were amended to criminalize marital rape, incorporate gender-neutral language, and recognize the effect of psychological coercion. In 2016 German laws were rewritten to remove a previous requirement that a victim physically resist their assailants and be overcome by force. The new law recognized any physical or verbal cue that one party does not consent to sexual contact. It also mandated deportation for migrants convicted of sexual assault, made it easier to prosecute rapes committed by groups, and criminalized other types of unwanted sexual contact, such as groping or fondling. The changes followed a series of high-profile cases that sparked public outrage at the inadequacy of the law. Incidence of rape in Germany has remained relatively stable, rising from 7.57 in 1995, to 9 per 100,000 people in 2009. Most victims are female and between the ages of 21 and 40. Nearly all perpetrators are male, and about half are current or former partners. Conviction rates have declined, going from 20% in the 1980s to as low as 8% in 2016, prior to major legislative reforms. Germany was the site of mass rape by invading Allied forces, most notably the Soviet army, during the latter part of World War II, with the estimated number of victims ranging from tens of thousands to as many as two million. World War II In the Soviet invasion of Germany during World War II a large number of mass rapes were committed by the Red Army, in Germany as well as in other countries previously occupied by the Nazi army. Estimates range from tens of thousands to as many as two million victims, with non-Slavic and particularly ethnically German women targeted. In the words of one contemporary observer, \\"the Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty.\\" Many victims were mutilated, and subjected to gang rape or repeated rape over the course of several days. The Soviet leadership did little to prevent the violence. Some have estimated the number of rapes committed by U.S. servicemen in Germany to be 11,000, with the phrase \\"copulation without conversation is not fraternization\\" allegedly being used as a motto by United States Army troops.Schrijvers, Peter (1998). The Crash of Ruin: American Combat Soldiers in Europe During World War II. New York: New York University Press. p. 183. . One survey estimates that the French occupation forces committed \\"385 rapes in the Constance area; 600 in Bruchsal; and 500 in Freudenstadt.\\" French Moroccan soldiers were alleged to have committed widespread rape in the H√∂fingen District near Leonberg.Stephenson, Jill (2006) Hitler's Home Front: W√ºrttemberg under the Nazis London: Continuum. p. 289. . According to historian Norman Naimark and colleagues, \\"the poor discipline and rapacity of soviet soldier was matched in the Western zones only by French Moroccan troops,\\" specifically during the occupations of Baden and W√ºrttemberg. Modern prevalence Federal Criminal Police Office The prevalence of rape in Germany has remained relatively stable, and although the country has the second highest overall number of rapes reported in the EU, the number of reports per capita is average for the region. As of 1995 the recorded incidence of rape in Germany was 7.57 per 100,000 people. In 2009, about 7,314 rape cases were reported, a rate of 9 per 100,000 people. In 2011, there were about 7,539 reported cases of rape. In a 2005 study by the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, out of a sample of 10,264 women, 13% had experienced sexual violence after the age of 16, and of these, only 8% had reported the incident to law enforcement. From the same study, 6% reported experiencing rape, 4% attempted rape, 5% forced physical intimacy, and 4% some other form of forced sexual encounter. Nearly all (99%) of perpetrators were male, and half (49%) were current or former partners. For victims of sexual violence, 79% reported psychological symptoms, and 44% physical injuries. A study into sexual abuse sponsored by the European Commission and conducted by the Vienna-based Fundamental Rights Agency showed 8% of women had experienced sexual violence by partners, and 7% had experienced sexual violence by non-partners. Overall, between 92% and 96% of victims were female, and 70% were aged 21 to 40. Around 25% of victims were non-white, more than half were employed or students, and 6% experienced mental health issues, while 2% had some disability. Der Spiegel cited official crime statistics that 9.1% of sexual assaults reported in 2016 with at least one suspect registered had at least one suspect identified as an immigrant, a rise from 1.8% in 2012, and 2.6% in 2014. Some of this rise was attributed to the fact that in 2016, groping was made a criminal offence. There is little data on rape or other sexual violence directed toward males, with \\"nearly all\\" available studies of sexual violence examining women as victims, and sexual violence against men \\"almost ignored\\". When taken into consideration, it is mostly concerning abuse of boys, rather than rape or assault as it pertains to adult males. One national study in Germany from 2004, as reported in a 2009 thesis, indicated that between 10% and 20% of boys are in some respect sexually abused, with about 33% of perpetrators being female. =Public debate on migrant crime= In 2018 a 14-year-old German Jewish girl, Susanna Feldmann was raped and murdered on the night of the 22 or 23 May 2018. Ali Bashar, a 20-year-old asylum seeker from Iraqi Kurdistan, was named as a suspect.http://www.rudaw.net/english/world/11062018 The murder sparked a political debate in Germany. Ethnologist and head of the Research Centre of Global Islam Susanne Schr√∂ter at the Goethe University Frankfurt, said that these were no longer isolated incidents, speaking of a culture clash and suggesting that Germany needed to develop a new approach for dealing with aggressive men shaped by patriarchal cultures. According to Schr√∂ter, there are within Islam, as with other religions, patriarchal norms that she think legitimize violence and sexual assault against specific types of women and therefore some men from Islamic countries may view women in a completely different way. Far-right parties and social media exploited the case for their own ends. A fact-checking article in Der Spiegel found that fears of immigrant crime had been amplified by far-right propaganda in the public debate beyond the actual increase which was supported by official statistics. =Law enforcement response= According to a national report, the conviction rate for rape in Germany has declined: it was 20% in the 1980s, and by 2000 it was 13%. According to reports from Deutsche Presse-Agentur, prior to legal changes in 2016, 8% of rape trials resulted in a conviction. Conviction rates varied substantially across geographic areas, and according to income, with the three richest states having a conviction rate of 24% and seeing number of cases reduced to nearly 65% of their former levels, and the three poorest states seeing a 40% increase in cases and a 4% conviction rate. Of those reported to authorities, most (87%) were reported by the victim, 96% were interviewed and provided a witness statement, but only 23% received a forensic medical examination, one of the lowest in the EU. Legal history Discussion of rape has long been a taboo in Germany, with victims, women's rights organizations, and politicians struggling for support on issues pertaining to sexual abuse and violence. There have been recent political discussions of reforming related laws so that they comply with the Istanbul convention, which requires all signatories to ensure that engaging in any non-consensual act of a sexual nature is criminalized. Rape is generally reported to the police, although it is also allowed to be reported to the prosecutor or District Court. Many urban areas and states have specialist units for rape and sexual assault, but these efforts are not coordinated at the federal level, and the presence of such a unit is dependent on the finances of the area, and such units are absent in many rural areas. Because of the German statutory maximum sentences, the harshest punishment possible for rape is imprisonment for a period of 15 years. However, because it is not legally a form of punishment, courts may order \\"subsequent preventive detention\\" following the completion of a prison sentence for rape, in cases where the perpetrator suffers from a mental disorder, or would represent a serious danger to the public upon release. These may be of an indefinite period, subject to periodic reviews. Officials may also temporarily deny perpetrators access to the household without a court order, put them under a restraining order, and require them to pay damages. The statute of limitations for severe sexual coercion is 20 years, and that for less serious cases is 10. In cases where the victim is a minor, this timeframe begins once the child turns 18 years-of-age. =Penal code of 1871= According to the German penal code established in 1871, the definition of rape was to compel \\"a woman to have extramarital intercourse...by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb,\\" and was punishable by at least two years imprisonment. The law thus excluded any sexual contact between a married couple.Individual criminal responsibility and superior responsibility: Article 7(1) and Article 7(3) of the Statute Rape was grouped, along with sodomy and incest, as \\"crimes against personal honor, marriage, and the family.\\" More extensive punishments were provided in cases where the victim (presumed to be female only) was younger than 16, in cases of gang rape, and in cases of \\"major physical violence\\". = Post-war legislation and 1973 reforms = The German penal code experienced a number of changes during the Nazi era. Changes considered in keeping with Nazi philosophy were removed by the Allied Control Council during the re-establishment of Germany. A 1966 ruling of the Bundesgerichtshof required married women to have sexual intercourse with their partners \\"repeatedly\\" and prescribed they must not be \\"unresponsive\\" during the consummation. Between 1969 and 1974 the West German penal code was reformed by five different pieces of legislation. The fourth law for the reform of the penal code, dated 23 November 1973 (Viertes Gesetz zur Reform des Strafrechts - 4. StrRG), introduced changes shifting the focus from violations of morality to violations against the individual. =1997 reforms= In 1997, a broader definition was adopted, making the law gender neutral, abolishing the marital exemption, recognizing sexual violence which did not include penetration, and expanding the definition of force to include psychological coercion. This was done through the 13th criminal amendment, section 177-179, which deals with sexual abuse. The 1997 reform (due to the Dreiunddrei√üigstes Strafrechts√§nderungsgesetz, 33rd law to change the penal code) created a new system by combining sexual assault and rape into one statue, with sexual assault as the \\"base\\" crime. Rape, which was now defined as involving penetration, was made into a subset of sexual assault, as a particularly serious form. Reflecting the law's emphasis on the requirement for the use of force, a 2006 decision by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany overturned a lower court's conviction for rape, on the grounds that the \\"accused ripped off the clothes from the body of the co-plaintiff and had sexual intercourse with her against her explicitly expressed will‚Äù, but had not ‚Äúforced the victim with violence\\". According to a study performed in 2014, by an organization of women's counseling and rape crisis centers, out of 107 studied cases of rape, the majority of perpetrators were not prosecuted, because their actions fell outside the legal definition at the time. =1998 reforms= The Sixth Criminal Law Reform Act, passed in 1998 included a number of changes intended to harmonize sentencing for sexual, and non-sexual offenses, and generally resulted in increases in severity for sexual offenses. It also included provisions related to the protection of children, the disabled, the institutionalized, and drug addicts. = 2002 Violence Protection Act = The 2002 Violence Protection Act (Gewaltschutzgesetz) focussed broadly on all forms of domestic violence. While the previous assumption was that victims should leave their joint residence, the introduction of this law gave civil courts the power to serve orders on the perpetrator to vacate the residence. =2016 reforms= German language graffiti in Vienna from 2010, reading nein heisst nein, or \\"no means no\\" On 23 September 2016, the law was reformed again, with a new focus on lack of consent rather than resistance on the part of the victim. It broadened the legal definition to include \\"any sexual act that a victim declines through verbal or physical cues, whereas the previous law required the victim fight back,\\" and other forms of non-consensual sexual contact, such as groping and fondling, were not illegal. The new law strengthened penalties for all perpetrators of sexual assault, mandated deportation for convicted migrants, and made it easier to prosecute assaults committed by large groups. The law also provided equal punishment under the following circumstances, if the perpetrator: # Exploits the fact that the person cannot consent # Exploits the fact that the person is significantly impaired because of a physical or mental condition, unless there is prior consent # Exploits an element of surprise # Exploits a situation in which the victim is threatened with serious harm in case of resistance # Coerces the person to actively engage in or tolerate sexual acts by threatening serious harm Although the law dropped the previous requirement for the use of coercion or force by the perpetrator, it incorporated these elements as an aggravating factor, along with situations where the victim is incapacitated due to disease or disability. The changes followed a series of cases that sparked public outrage, and the popularity of the #NeinHeisstNein (no means no) campaign. These included the acquittal of two men changed with drugging and raping Gina-Lisa Lohfink, and posting video of it online, a video in which \\"she reportedly says 'stop it' and 'no' as they force themselves on her\\". It also followed the events of the 2015/2016 New Year's Eve, mainly in the city of Cologne, where hundreds of women were sexually assaulted, but through actions which, it was ultimately determined, were not illegal under the current law. Other high-profile cases included the 2016 Murder of Maria Ladenburger and 2018 Killing of Susanna Feldmann, which gained attention because the attacks were carried out by immigrants. Statutory rape Consensual sex is legal from the age of 14 in most cases. There is an exception if the older partner is above the age of 18, and is ‚Äúexploiting a coercive situation‚Äù or offering compensation, and the younger partner is under 16. It is also illegal for someone older than 21 to have sex with someone under the age of 16 if the older person ‚Äúexploits the victim‚Äôs lack of capacity for sexual self-determination.‚Äù Services for victims Beginning in 1984, victims may access government funded legal services according to means tested eligibility criteria. More commonly, victims who cannot afford legal representation may be appointed a lawyer; however, prosecutors are obliged to pursue the case regardless of whether the victim is a party to the proceedings. Victims may also receive services from privately run Weisser Ring or White Ring victim support organizations, or Notruf and Wildwasser rape crisis centers located throughout the country. Representatives from these organizations my accompany the victims in filing reports, during interviews, and throughout legal proceedings.

He is Professor of Indian Art and Architecture at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi where his research and graduate teaching focus on Indian iconography and sculpture, temple architecture and Sultanate-period painting. He is also the Editor of Marg, India‚Äôs leading quarterly magazine and journal on the arts, published from Mumbai. His studies on privately owned objects‚Äîterracottas, ivories and small finds‚Äîhave drawn attention to a wide range of ritual cultures and transcultural exchanges at an everyday, quotidian level. He has curated several exhibitions, most notably The Body in Indian Art and Thought, and published books, including The Making of the Modern Indian Artist Craftsman: Devi Prasad. Early life Professor Ahuja received his Ph.D. in Art and Archaeology from the School of Oriental and African Studies, at the University of London in 2001. His thesis was titled ‚ÄòEarly Indian Moulded Terracotta: The Emergence of an Iconography and Variations in Style, Second Century BC to First Century AD‚Äô. A specific research contribution was his work on votive figurines and other imagery from the post-Mauryan period which brought to light a pantheon of Indian gods and goddesses that were irrevocably transformed after AD 200. Career =As Professor= Professor Ahuja has been tutor of the SOAS/Christie‚Äôs Asian Arts Course, the SOAS M.A. course in Religious, Fine and Decorative Arts of South Asia, and the British Museum‚Äôs Diploma in Asian Art. He has held Visiting Professorships and Fellowships at the University of Zurich, the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford, the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence, the University of Alberta in Edmonton and Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi. Currently he teaches at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. His research and graduate teaching covers a diverse range of subjects including periods of artistic/visual exchange in pre-modern societies like ancient Gandhara, ancient temple statuary and iconography and the manuscripts painted in the Sultanate period in India. =Curator= As fellow of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, he authored a comprehensive catalogue of their collections of ancient Indian statuary and archaeological material. He has also held a curatorial position at the British Museum apart from curating several independent exhibitions in India and abroad on themes ranging from ancient to contemporary art. His research has led to several publications on ancient Indian art and religion, including ‚ÄòChanging Gods, Enduring Rituals: Observations on Early Indian Religion as seen through Terracotta Imagery c. 200 BC- AD 200.‚Äô His book, The Making of the Modern Indian Artist-Craftsman: Devi Prasad (Routledge, 2011) provided a case-study of the impact of the Arts and Crafts Movement on India. Most recently, he curated the exhibition ‚ÄòThe Body in Indian Art and Thought‚Äô which was held at Palais des Beaux Arts in Brussels and National Museum, New Delhi The catalogue for the exhibition became The Body in Indian Art and Thought (Ludion, Antwerp, 2013, also in French and Dutch), exploring a variety of fundamental approaches to the aesthetics of anthropomorphic representation in India and the larger ideas that drive people to make images. William Dalrymple, in an article on the exhibition in The Guardian, claimed that ‚Äòit is unlikely that a show like this will be put on again in our lifetime.‚Äô =Views= On 18 March 2012 at the convention \\"Collecting Ancient Art in the 21st Century\\", Naman said that in many countries modern development proved as serious a threat to archaeological sites as looting. It was imperative for collectors to engage with the views of archaeologists and challenging collector groups to find ways to help source countries stop looting. He is also vocal about the role of public officials in national cultural institutions. Such an idea of personal and public roles has also seen him strongly advocate a revision in the Antiquities law. =Publications= *The Making of the Modern Indian Artist Craftsman: Devi Prasad.

In Pennsylvania, public charter schools are initially approved and subsequently overseen by the local school board (LEA). If the local school board denies the charter school's application, the prospective Charter School may appeal to the state's Charter School Appeal Board. Once approved by the local school district, the Charter is governed by a locally selected Board of Trustees. Vida Charter has five (5) Board members, one of whom is from Hanover, Pennsylvania. They make in-depth, annual reports to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In Pennsylvania, public charter schools are a public school alternative to the local public schools. Students may seek admission to a local charter school. The student's home public school district pays the tuition costs on the student's behalf. Additionally, when the local school district provides transportation to its students it must also provide transportation at no cost to charter school students, when the receiving school is within 10 miles of the District's borders. Pennsylvania charter schools have the same academic accountability as traditional public schools and must give the PSSAs to their pupils each year, working to achieve AYP status. Vida Charter School applied for authorization of its charter in November 2007. Both the Gettysburg Area School Board and the Hanover Public School District Board rejected the application. In April 2008, the school's founders applied again to Gettysburg Area School Board and Hanover Public School District. When it was once again rejected, the school's founders appealed the decision to the Pennsylvania Charter School Appeal Board. Vida Charter School's application was approved. According to PA Charter School law, if more students apply to attend than there are open slots available, Vida Charter School is required to use a random lottery system to select new incoming students.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Summary of Charter School Legislation, 2014 According to the Charter School law, siblings (brothers and sisters), and children of individuals who help establish a charter school, are granted an \\"admissions preference.\\" Students residing in the Gettysburg Area School District are selected first, according to the number of slots available for students.

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to any public School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the local School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rate for Gettysburg Area School District Elementary Schools ‚Äì $9,935.50. The 2012 tuition rate for Hanover Public School District Elementary School ‚Äì $10,150.20. For students who reside in other local school districts, their home school district pays its mandated tuition rate to the charter school. The 2015 tuition rate for Gettysburg Area School District Elementary Schools ‚Äì $11,081.43. Gettysburg Area SD's per pupil spending was $18,658.95.PDE, Finances Selected Data by LEA, 2015 The 2014 tuition rate for Hanover Public School District Elementary School was $10,437.10; while Hanover Public SD's per pupil spending was $15,327.02 in 2014. The tuition remained the same for 2015-16.PDE, Finances Selected Data by LEA Tuition rates, 2016 Special education In December 2015, Vida Charter School administration reported that 18 pupils or 7% of the school's pupils received Special Education services, with 0% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2012, the School's administration reported that 20 pupils or 12.4% of the school's pupils received Special Education services, with 60% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment, in Pennsylvania public schools was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the School seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the School. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Funding for special education services come from additional payment by the resident public school district set by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Wellness policy Vida Charter School Board of Trustees established a wellness policy in 2009. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district or charter school can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, schools must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, schools were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Schools were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Vida Charter School works to provide an economically sustainable meal program making available a healthy and nutritious breakfast, lunch, and after-school snack (during after-school activities) to every student. The School has the goal to utilize food from its school gardens and local farms. Vida Charter School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. School safety and bullying The Vida Charter School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the School in 2012-13. Additionally, there were and no sexual incidents involving students. There were also no incidents where local law enforcement was involved. Each year the school safety data is reported by the every Pennsylvania public school to the Safe School Center, which then publishes the compiled reports online. The Vida Charter School Board of Trustees has provided the school's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. At Vida Charter School the Principal is so designated. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and must review their policy every three years. Additionally, the school must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness grant Vida Charter School won a $1,000 Nutritional Education Grant, from the Consumer Wellness Center (AZ).

The Ever Renewing) is a popular award-winning poem by the noted Indian English poet and literary critic Rajlukshmee Debee Bhattacharya. The poem won First Prize in the Third All India Poetry Competition conducted by The Poetry Society (India) in 1991. The poem has been widely cited and anthologised in reputed journals and scholarly volumes on contemporary Indian poetry. Structure of the poem The poem has a unique and original structure, which marks a departure from contemporary Indian poetry. Its five lines can be regarded as five stanzas or five paragraphs. The diction is that of prose, but the strong evocative imagery belongs to poetry of the highest quality. The five stanzas evoke images pertaining to five different sense organs - sight, smell, touch, hearing and smell. The poem can be thought of a bouquet of meditations on different paths to Truth. Excerpts from the poem :\\"Punonnoba\\"-Punarnava? :In some rainy month, did you decide :to climb up our lichened wall, to reach :the rusty tin-roof, transforming :its shabbiness into velvet-green, :to hang your emerald-pendants :around the neck of our home? ::: ***** :All knew the perennial Madhavilata; :the fragrant Hasnuhana; queen of the night. :They gaped when they saw you :running wild on our roof ‚Äì :Velvet- green, strange, unknown. :We shouted with glee, \\"It is Punonnoba ‚Ä¶ Punarnava.\\" :That you had medicinal properties :that your juice soothes and heals :we never knew till the Vaid :sent his servant, :a demon who expertly climbed our roof :hacked away at its emerald-fringed coverlet! :Oh the despair and the hope :the running out in soaking rain :to watch your extending tendrils, :sprouting leaves, :growing in greenness ‚Ä¶ Punarnava ‚Ä¶ :eternal companion on the root-top. :That home was left behind, :as birth-strings snapped. ::: ***** :A refugee, wanderer, I :look for you, but no one here :knows your name.

Comments and criticism The poem has received rave reviews since its first publication in 1995 in the anthology on Indian Poetry Emerging Voices.Poetry India - Emerging Voices by H K Kaul, Virgo Publications, 1991. The poem has been frequently quoted in scholarly analysis of contemporary Indian English Poetry. The poem is regarded by critics as a jewel in contemporary Indian poetry. Although outwardly the poem describes the leafy growth of a household creeper, it has a hidden message on the re-awakening of woman and regeneration of India's woman power.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on April 9, 2014. Plot After consulting with Arkady and Oleg, and with the promise of coaching from Oleg, Nina tells Stan that she will take the FBI's polygraph test. Oleg suggests a few techniques including that she visualize him in the room as well as clenching her anus. During the polygraph test, the FBI asks if she knows who killed Vlad. She answers yes while looking at Stan knowingly. After she passes, she declines Stan's offer to get her out of the embassy, saying that she will be able to help him more after she is read into the Illegals Program. It is revealed that Nina and Oleg were planning this together. They celebrate their success and have sex in a hotel room. Kate relays orders for Philip to bug the ARPANET. Philip recruits the help of Charles Duluth, an alcoholic conservative journalist who is also a KGB agent. Posing as a journalist, Philip first meets with a computer scientist at a university to learn the details of ARPANET. Later, Philip and Duluth break into the university to plant the bug. Philip is forced to set off the alarms in order to enter the computer lab undetected, but is forced to kill one of the employees when they return to grab their wallet. Philip later finds Duluth drinking at the bar. Duluth expresses exhilaration over the success of the mission, and a more reserved Philip reveals he was forced to kill the worker. With Philip watching afar with a sniper rifle, Larrick tells Elizabeth that he has been ordered to Nicaragua, to set up a base and mine the harbor of Managua, but he will still be able to let them into the Contra training camp before he leaves. Lucia is upset to learn this, because (as she tells Elizabeth) she planned to kill Larrick there in revenge for his atrocities in Nicaragua. Elizabeth tells her that Larrick is more valuable as a cooperating asset, and expresses her doubts about Lucia's reliability to Philip. Henry observes a neighbor's house with his telescope, and sneaks in to play Intellivision while they are gone, something his parents had forbidden him from doing.

The poem has been frequently quoted in scholarly analysis of contemporary Indian English Poetry. The poem is regarded by critics as a jewel in contemporary Indian poetry. Although outwardly the poem describes the Hindu Goddess Kali, her tantrums and her equation with her son Ganesha and consort Shiva, the poem has a clear existentialist message for the Indian woman and her many socio-psychological trappings. In her writings, Rukmini brings about this interplay between the esoteric and the mundane in systematic subjugation of Indian woman over the centuries.

The tradition of the Weltsekttag was founded in the short interim period separating the wars of the Second and Third Coalition, and was initiated amongst others by the German poet Ludwig Achim von Arnim as a sign of unity against the tyranny of Napoleon Bonaparte.  History  = The Sekttag of 1805 = Achim von Arnim as a student in the year 1804. German student and poet Carl Ludwig B√∂rne was the first to propose the celebration of a Weltsekttag during an academic conference held at Gie√üen upon the 4th of March 1805, without favouring a particular date, however. The idea was inspired by attempts in the previous years by French vintners to initiate collective day of marked resistance to the coalition wars and the resulting economic conditions which had had a strongly negative effect upon the wine trade. These attempts were largely unsuccessful. Ludwig Achim von Arnim brought the idea to Halle an der Saale, one of the oldest and most important German universities and a centre of the literary movement of the Enlightenment in the late 18th and early 19th century, where it was picked up by academic \\"Kr√§nzchen\\" (\\"little circles\\") and \\"Convente\\" (\\"conventions\\") of similar corporations. While it was the poet Ludwig Achim von Arnim who carried the original idea to Halle, it were the German poets Ludwig B√∂rne and Clemens Brentano who were responsible for the foundation of the actual tradition of the fixed Sekttag during the 1805 conference of Gie√üen, where the decision was accepted. The Beschluss (decision) of Gie√üen read as follows: The first Sekttag was subsequently celebrated upon the 9th of April 1805 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The choice of the date was intended to symbolically represent and underline the happy and open-minded character of the Sekttag.  Situation today  Today, more than 200 years after the original celebrations, students gather yearly upon the 9th of April (and also occasionally upon other days, varying from university city to university city) either under more organized forms of tradition or in less formal gatherings, to drink sparkling wine and honour the memory of the great poets and students. Academic drawings and paintings from the first half of the 19th century not rarely depicts a drinking student who stands upon a table with a glass in his hand, which is a telling reference to the popularity which the tradition would soon come to enjoy. Achim von Arnims immortal \\"Sektlied\\" is still sung around the world by German-speaking celebrants: : Schafft her den Sekt! - Ein brav Student : Zecht fest bis er verreckt : Voll bis zum Rand, doch eloquent : Den Vollrausch er bezweckt! : So st√ºrmen wir mit Saus und Braus : In die verlog'ne Welt hinaus : Und wer da bleibt allein zuhaus : Den holen wir beim Teufel raus! : Vivallera!

The pyramid is presumed to be the burial place of the Herakleopolitan pharaoh Merikare, who ruled toward the end of the Tenth Dynasty c. 2040 BC during the First Intermediate Period. Sometimes, the Headless Pyramid in North Saqqara is identified as the pyramid of Merikare, although the latter is more likely to belong to pharaoh Menkauhor. Attestations Although undiscovered, the pyramid of Merikare is the only attested pyramid of a king belonging to the Herakleopolitan dynasties (the Ninth and Tenth). The pyramid is known by nine inscriptions, eight of which are from northern Saqqara; while the ninth is of unknown origin. From those inscriptions it is known that the ancient name of the pyramid was \\"Wadj Sut Merikare\\" variously translated as \\"Flourishing are the abodes of Merikare\\" or \\"The fresh places of Merikare\\".Mark Lehner: The Complete Pyramids, Thames & Hudson, , p. 165. All these inscriptions were found in the tombs of priests and at least four of these priests were responsible for the funerary cult of both kings Merikare and the earlier Sixth Dynasty king, Teti. The priests lived during the early Twelfth Dynasty (1991 BC - 1802 BC), demonstrating that the funerary cults of these kings remained active during the Middle Kingdom and, most importantly, that Merikare's pyramid must have been in the vicinity of the Pyramid of Teti, in Saqqara. Identification Map of Saqqara - in red, the Headless Pyramid (Lepsius XXIX), initially identified with Merikare, but sometimes identified as that of Menkauhor Kaiu Using the funerary steles of the twelfth dynasty priests, Cecil Mallaby Firth believed to have found the pyramid of Merikare in 1926 on the southeast corner of that of Teti. Unfortunately, the structure identified by Firth later turned out that to be the small cult pyramid of Teti's pyramid complex. Another hypothesis emerged in the second half of the twentieth century identifying the pyramid of Merikare with the Lepsius pyramid no. XXIX, located in Saqqara-north and commonly known as the Headless Pyramid. Later, this hypothesis was rejected by some scholars such as Jocelyne Berlandini who proposed in 1979 that the Headless Pyramid is more likely to belong to the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Menkauhor,Jocelyne Berlandini: La pyramide ruin√©e de Sakkara-nord et le roi Ikaouhor-Menkaouhor, Revue d'Egyptologie 31, (1979), pp. 3-28. Available online the only Fifth Dynasty ruler whose pyramid had not been identified formally. Berlandini based her conclusion on the construction techniques featured in the pyramid as well as the fact that, to a great extent, the priests of the funerary cult of Menkauhor were buried in northern Saqqara. In 1994, however, Jaromir Malek published a study arguing again that Merikare is the owner of the Headless Pyramid.Jaromir Malek: King Merykare and his Pyramid, in C. Berger, G. Clerc and N. Grimal (eds) Hommages √† Jean Leclant, Vol. 4., (Biblioth√®que d'√©tude 106/4), Cairo 1994, pp. 203‚Äì214. For example, Malek points out that no burials dating to the Fifth Dynasty are located in the immediate vicinity of the Headless Pyramid. In 2008, continuing excavations on the site of the Headless Pyramid under the direction of Zahi Hawass corroborated Berlandini's assignment of it to the Fifth Dynasty. This conclusion was reached based on evaluations of the structure of the monument as well as the construction materials employed, both being typical of that era. Although no inscriptions naming a pharaoh were uncovered, Hawass attributed the pyramid to Menkauhor since he is the only pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty whose pyramid had not been identified.Associated Press: Katarina Kratovac: Mystery of ‚ÄòHeadless Pyramid‚Äô solved, June 5, 2008 If Berlandini and Hawass are correct, then the pyramid of Merikare remains undiscovered, somewhere in the sands of Saqqara.
