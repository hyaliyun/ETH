From 1945-1949 and later from 1954-1957 he represented the Communist Party of Norway in the Parliament of Norway. His importance to posterity has been intimately tied to the dramatic split of the Communist Party in 1949, the so-called Furubotn purge. Early work and political career In 1924 he became as journalist in the party daily newspaper Ny Tid in Trondheim, and starting that same year and until 1928 he was the secretary for the Young Communist League. In 1930 he became editor of Hardanger Arbeiderblad in Odda, and from 1931 his base was in Oslo, as a co- worker of the Arbeideren and as a member of the central board of the party. He was the representative of the central board on the strike rally which was later to become the Skirmish of Menstad, and in its aftermath he was given a prison sentence. Concentration camp and post-war politician Strand Johansen was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 and spent a major part of the war in Sachsenhausen. In 1945 he became part secretary, and at the same time he was elected to the Storting, becoming one of two NKP representatives in the coalition government. He was a central figure in the failed coalition negotiations with the Labour Party the same year. The Furubotn purge \\"The Furubotn purge\\" (Furubotn-oppgj√∏ret) is the term that has been applied to the turbulent split of the Norwegian Communist party in 1949. Strand Johansen, who was the main organizer of NKP's election campaign in 1949, was central also in the internal conflict that ensued and headed the faction that opposed Peder Furubotn - the \\"L√∏vlien faction\\" as it was named after party chairman Emil L√∏vlien. In the book Fiendebilde Wollweber (Enemy picture Wollweber) by Norwegian historian Lars Borgersrud, Strand Johansen is portrayed as a vitriolic opponent of the Furubotn faction. The conflict climaxed on 26 October 1949, when Strand Johansen together with five or more people showed up in the party offices in Klingenberggata 4 and kicked out Furubotn's supporters. The purge began six days prior when he had initiated the move against Furubotn at a meeting of trustees of the Oslo party, levelling against the supporters of Peder Furubotn fierce accusations of factionalism and of having set up an illegitimate party leadership - \\"the second center\\". In the following days the attacks continued during other party meetings, and on 25 October the central board decided to investigate the accusations and present them to the leadership of Cominform. In the meantime all individuals that had been accused by Strand Johansen would resign from their positions and a new central board was to be constituted. After the removal of Furubotn's people on 26 October, assisted by among others Asbj√∏rn Sunde and Ragnar \\"Pelle\\" Sollie, Strand Johansen saw to it that Furubotn was excluded by the newly constituted central board which contained no supporters of Furubotn. Both during this commotion and during the next parliamentary campaign in 1953 witnesses described Johansen as mentally disturbed, initially as a natural reaction of disappointment at the obliteration of the communist representation in the parliament. In 1953 it was even suggested that Johansen should be sent off, either to the countryside or ¬´exported¬ª to the USSR. Asbj√∏rn Sunde even suggested that Johansen be assassinated but received no support for such a drastic measure. Hans I. Kleven who himself was excluded from the party in the purge but was later invited back and went on to become its leader in the 1980s, has characterized Strand Johansen as a \\"sick, yes, a hysterical person,\\" attributing these traits to the concentration camp period. Exit politics In 1953 he was elected deputy chairman of the party, but he resigned in 1955 after having been sent off to Moscow for a spa treatment. He remained in Moscow until his death, and he did not have any political role after 1955.

Fate was released for the PC Steam client on December 12, 2013. Three sequels ‚Äî titled Fate: Undiscovered Realms, Fate: The Traitor Soul and Fate: The Cursed King ‚Äî were released in 2008, 2009 and 2011 respectively. Gameplay Fate is a fantasy action role-playing game. This type of game is also known as a dungeon crawler, in which the player takes his/her character through progressively difficult levels of a dungeon, fighting monsters, completing quests, collecting valuable items and gold, and improving the character's attributes and skills along the way. The dungeon in Fate has a randomized layout for each level; treasures found within each level are randomized, as are the number and type of monsters. Fate is rendered fully in 3D, allowing the player to zoom in and out of the action as necessary; however, the camera cannot be rotated. In The Traitor Soul and The Cursed King (but not Undiscovered Realms) you can simultaneously press CTRL+SHIFT+U to unlock the camera. Holding arrow left/right allows you to peer around corners. =Levels= There appears to be an effectively indefinite number of levels to the dungeon. However, using the games internal console - while on the adventure screen (where you move your character, etc.) press Ctrl, Shift, and ~. Then a '?' should appear on the left side of the screen - you can input the command \\"descend 2,147,483,647\\". The coding of the game supports access up to level 2,147,483,647. This number is the maximum positive value that a 32-bit signed integer can hold - advancing beyond said level would cause the 'level number' to overflow to ‚àí2,147,483,648. As the game's procedural generation algorithm uses the level number as one of its inputs, the negative value unsurprisingly leads to the algorithm creating an invalid level, leading to a game-crash https://www.gamespot.com/fate/cheats/. =Pets and fishing= The player is accompanied by a pet, which can initially be chosen as a dog (specifically, a terrier) or a cat. This pet fights on behalf of the player, can carry items, and can be sent back to town in order to sell unwanted findings (though it cannot collect rewards for fetch quests). If the pet's Health Points are driven down to zero (due to blows or damaging spells from enemies) it does not die, but merely flees the fight. Hence, the game's introduction describes the pet as invincible since it cannot be killed. It will still follow the character, but it won't fight until it regains some health. To fully heal their pet, the player can send it back to town, feed it healing potions or charms, or make it drink from a health fountain. The player can also transform the pet into various (and more powerful) creatures by feeding it fish, which can be caught in fishing holes found throughout the game or purchased from vendors. The time of the transformation depends on the 'size' of the fish, but a flawless fish makes the transformation permanent until the pet is fed a different fish. A \\"Dogfish\\" will make the pet return to its original form. It is also possible to get rare items from fish. A patient player who takes time to fish can make their character very wealthy and obtain top-notch gear. The Player's Manual says, \\"Finding or purchasing a fishing pole is one of the best investments you can make in the game.\\" There is a fishing hole in the town; by selling fish that the player catches, the player can get money for purchasing better gear before braving the dungeon. The deeper the character is in the dungeon, the better items and more powerful pet transformations they can find while angling. Screenshot showing spell effects in Fate =Player characters= When the character gains enough experience points, they are promoted to the next character level and given five Attribute points as well as two Skill points. Increasing the four attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Magic) allow the character to wield stronger weapons, armor and magical spells, while Skills denote proficiency at certain things (Sword Skill, Charm Magic Skill, Critical Strike Skill, etc.‚Äîthere are a total of 15 different Skills). There are no set character classes in Fate, allowing maximum customization. Additionally, the player is rewarded with Fame points for completing side-quests and defeating enemy bosses, which contribute to the gaining of Fame levels. Four Skill Points are awarded for gaining a Fame level. Elite and Legendary items cannot be used until the player is at a certain Fame level. Certain items (i.e., weapons, armor, and jewelry) contain sockets, into which the player can put special gems in order to customize the item. Having sockets does not create higher requirements for using an item, although they make the item more valuable. Finally, a denizen of Grove, specifically a minstrel, can be paid to increase the character's Fame, \\"allowing savvy players to buy Skill points.\\" =Non-player characters and quests= Several townspeople of Grove offer randomized side-quests to the player. These are sometimes called fetch quests (retrieving a valuable item from the dungeon), though they often require the player to kill off all enemies of a certain type on a certain level of the dungeon or dispatch an enemy boss. Upon completion of a side-quest, the player can return to the townsperson who gave it to them, and receive a reward of Fame Points, Experience Points and gold. Sometimes a valuable item is also given as part of the reward for completing a side-quest. In the case of a fetch quest, players can always decide if they want to keep the item they were sent to retrieve or if the potential rewards for turning it in to the quest giver are more important. To keep an item from a fetch quest, the player must cancel the quest in the quest book. Other non-player townspeople include vendors, who sell arms, armor, potions, etc. In addition to the various vendors and quest givers in the town, there is also a Healer, who will bring the character's and his/her pet's Health Points up to full capacity free of charge, and an Enchanter who, for a fee, will try (sometimes unsuccessfully) to add an enchantment or a socket to an item of the player's choosing. However, once in a while, he will accidentally delete all of the item's enchantments or even put a curse on the item, reducing its usefulness. Sometimes a vendor will appear in the dungeon. Vendors have neutral status in the game, so enemies won't attack them. The player's character cannot be attacked by enemies while engaged in buying or selling with a vendor. Vendors who appear in the dungeon are Pikko the Fisherman (who will sell fish and fishing poles) and Getts the Traveler (who will sell miscellaneous items). =Death= If at any point in the game the character dies (Health Points driven down to zero) the death is not permanent. The personification of Fate appears, who resembles the Grim Reaper. Fate offers the player three choices: first, the character can be brought back to life at the spot where they fell, in exchange for a portion of their Experience Points and Fame Points. Second, they can be brought back to life and transported to a nearby level (one or two levels up or down) in exchange for a portion of the character's gold. This new place may be safer or more dangerous than the one where the character died. Third, the character can be brought back to life and transported three levels up in exchange for leaving all of their gold where they fell. This new location is usually safer than where the death occurred. (If the character died on level 1, 2, or 3 of the dungeon they will be taken back to town.) If the player chooses this third option and can make it back to the exact spot where his/her character fell before the dungeon level regenerates, his/her gold will be waiting in a pile for them to pick up. (If the character stays out of a previously visited dungeon level for 20 minutes on the game clock, the level will be automatically refreshed with all new monsters and treasure, although the dungeon layout stays the same. Therefore, if the character died on that level and doesn't make it back within 20 minutes, any gold they left there when they died will be gone permanently. The 20-minute rule does not apply if the character has a portal to that level, since one end of the portal is constantly occupying the level. However, if the character has died and been transported three levels up, there will be no portal.) If none of these three options is to the player's liking, they may choose Quit and the character is effectively transported back in time to the last occasion the game loaded. However, the death is still recorded in the character's journal. =Retirement= If the player completes the main quest they received at the beginning of the game, they are given the option to retire the current character and start play over again with a descendant of the first character. The descendant gets various perks and bonuses, including one item that is handed down from its ancestor. If this family heirloom has any magical enchantments on it, they will be augmented by 25% every time the item is passed down. If a weapon or piece of armor is passed down, its damage done or defensive capabilities will be increased as well. If a player chooses not to retire, they can advance their characters and go as deep into the dungeon as they like. Plot The game starts in the town of Grove, where on the outskirts of town the ancient Dungeon Gate leads would-be adventurers to multiple levels of fame, fortune, and death. The player assumes the role of one of these adventurers, and is assigned a randomized quest at the beginning of the game that will take them to approximately the 45th-50th level of the dungeon. Along the way, randomized side-quests are made available to the player by the townspeople of Grove. Eventually, the player completes the primary quest by defeating the randomized boss monster. Mods Like many other games in its class, Fate has an active modding community. The developers have released tools to aid in the creation of mods and over 100 mods exist in a community database. Mods for Fate range from simple potions and weapons to new spells and town make-overs. The community has created tutorials for creating new weapons, armor, spells, monsters, and other such items. One pitfall of these activities is the stability of the game; for this reason, it is recommended that the original game files be backed up prior to the installation of any third-party changes. Development Designer and programmer Travis Baldree intended Fate to combine elements from games like Diablo and NetHack and make them accessible to a casual gaming audience, while also maintaining a level of appeal to hardcore gamers. He eschewed a grim and gritty style, in favor of a more inviting atmosphere. Although Baldree had considered the idea for several years, production of the game began in October 2004, with a total development time of about five months. Fate offers no multiplayer elements. Multiplayer was considered, but the developers could not add it because of the game's extremely short development time. Based on his work on Fate, Baldree was hired by Flagship Studios. By 2006 he headed a Seattle-based offshoot of the studio, developing Mythos, an online action RPG, with a group that included several members of the Fate team. =Music= The score uses Western classical guitar and Middle Eastern influences much as the Diablo series does. There is also a noted Celtic influence, as one of the main themes is \\"Captain O'Kane\\" by Turlough O'Carolan. Other notable tracks within the game with a Celtic influence are \\"The Clergy's Lamentation\\", \\"Good Morning to Your Nightcap\\" and \\"Behind the Haystack\\" which serve as themes of the Town of Grove. \\"Captain O'Kane\\" and \\"The Clergy's Lamentation\\" are recordings by Ensemble Galilei available on the album Music in the Great Hall: Instrumental Music from the Ancient Celtic Lands,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4oDu74Kkohttps://www.amazon.com/Music- Great-Hall-Instrumental-Ancient/dp/B000003JLK another version of \\"The Clergy's Lamentation\\" is performed by harpist Sue Richards taken from the album Grey Eyed Morn,http://www.maggiesmusic.com/products/mm201.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7lbN2eaJ8A \\"Good Morning to Your Nightcap\\" and \\"Behind the Haystack\\" are from Karen Ashbrook's album Hills of Erin.https://www.karenashbrook.com/store/hills.html Reception Fate was positively received by critics, garnering an average review score of 80% at GameRankings and a score of 80/100 at Metacritic. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot called it \\"a high-quality game that delivers well on a concept that isn't ambitious but is well known for being fun and addictive,\\" while pointing out its strong resemblance to Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo. Writing for GameSpy, William Abner praised the game as \\"elegantly designed\\" and singled out the charm and personality of the game's graphics and pet animations. Both reviewers cited Fate's low price as a selling point but criticized its lack of multiplayer features. The editors of Computer Games Magazine presented Fate with their 2005 \\"Best Role-Playing Game\\" award. It was a runner-up for their list of the year's top 10 computer games. Fate was also a finalist for PC Gamer USs \\"Best Roleplaying Game 2005\\" and \\"Best Value 2005\\" awards, which ultimately went to Dungeon Siege II and Guild Wars, respectively.

The lake is crossed by the border of Hennepin and Carver counties, with most of the area lying within the jurisdiction of the former. Christmas Lake is known for its exceptional water clarity, the best in the Minneapolis metropolitan area, with a DNR-reported clarity level of . This clarity can be attributed to the fact that Christmas Lake is a spring fed lake with a sandy bottom. Although relatively small in area, Christmas Lake becomes deep (its maximum depth is ) very quickly, forming the basin of a depression that extends all along \\"the Ridge\\" (the rim of the lake's basin). The steep nature of the shoreline means that many houses are built far above the lake with railed motorized carts to provide access to the docks at the water level. Although Christmas Lake is located very near to the much larger and more populated Lake Minnetonka, the lake culture is much different, with fewer powerboats and jetskis, although this is slowly changing. Christmas Lake is connected to Lake Minnetonka by an underground canal which can be used to raise the water level of Lake Minnetonka during droughts. Christmas Lake falls under the jurisdiction of the city of Shorewood, Minnesota, although much informal control is maintained by the close-knit community of homeowners, under the aegis of the Christmas Lake Homeowners Association. Neighbors organize an annual Fourth of July boat parade, where boat owners turn their boats into water-borne floats, and parade from dock to dock along the shoreline. Wildlife Trumpeter Swans on Christmas Lake before ice-in in 2006.Christmas Lake is home to a number of native and introduced species of fish, the most prevalent of which are largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, crappie, northern pike, carp, and rainbow trout. However, due to the small size of the lake, the fish (with the exception of carp) do not generally grow to large sizes. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake's bluegill, carp, northern pike, and white sucker due to mercury contamination. For the first time in recent memory, trumpeter swans have since 2004 been using Christmas Lake as a stop-over on their flywayThe Trumpeter Swan Society: Central, Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways, additional text. during their winter migration south. At first a small number of swans stayed for a few days, and by 2011 that number had grown to over four dozen in three different groups who stayed on the lake for more than a month. As Christmas Lake is deeper than surrounding lakes, and usually the last in the neighborhood to freeze over, the swans are able to swim and feed later in the season. In the fall of 2014, zebra mussels were observed in the lake and the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District subjected approximately one acre of it to an experimental series of chemical treatments, first the Zequanox killed-bacteria biological pesticide (in its first use in a lake), followed by copper, and then by potash (in its third such use in the U.S.). Divers later confirmed that none had survived within the treated area, but discovered ten more of them nearby, attached to indigenous mussels, and in May the treatment was applied to that additional area. The name Pillar on right is monument for Charles W. Christmas (1798-1904) in Minneapolis Pioneers and Soldiers Memorial Cemetery. The lake is named for Charles W.

She held the titles of Princess of Berar through marriage, and Imperial Princess of the Ottoman Empire by birth before the monarchy's abolition in 1922. Biography D√ºrr√º≈üehvar at nine and a half years old, 1923 =Youth= The princess was born at the √áamlƒ±ca Palace in √úsk√ºdar, then part of Constantinople, when the Ottoman Caliphate was passing through its last phase. Her father, Caliph Abd√ºlmecid II, went into exile in Paris, France, after the abolition of the Caliphate by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in 1924. =Marriage= Upon the family's exile to France in 1924, she was sought by the Shah of Persia and King Fuad I of Egypt as a bride for their respective heirs, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and Farouk, and by Prince Azam Jah (1907‚Äì1970), the eldest son and heir of the last Nizam of Hyderabad State, Osman Ali Khan, Asif Jah VII, whom she married in Nice, France, on 12 November 1932. Her first cousin Nil√ºfer, was married to Prince Moazzam Jah, the second son of the Nizam. Rukiye Sabiha, April 1920 The marriage of the princess was performed, in the south of France, by the good offices of Maulana Shaukat Ali, brother of Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar, the leader of the Khilafat Movement in India. D√ºrr√º≈üehvar was 18 at the time, and significantly taller than her husband of 25, Azam Jah. Her father-in-law, the Nizam loved pointing out how much taller she was than his son, at their parties. It was believed at that time that the matrimonial alliance between the Nizam, the richest ruler in the world of his time, and the deposed Caliph would lead to the emergence of a Muslim ruler who could be acceptable to the world powers in place of the Ottoman sultans. D√ºrr√º≈üehvar, whose father was raised by a branch of the Ottoman monarchy deeply interested in modernizing reforms and believed in modern education for women including his wives and daughter, became a popular public figure after her arrival in Hyderabad. She believed that women should earn their own living, and helped to remove the practice of purdah. =Social life= Highly respected and well-educated lady, the princess was fluent in French, Turkish, English and also Urdu. She also established a junior college for girls in her name, Bagh-e-jahan Ara, Yakutpura, Hyderabad. She divided her time principally between Hyderabad and London, where she died, attended by her two sons. Philip Mason, of the Indian Civil Service, described her as \\"a commanding figure, handsome of feature, with a clear fair complexion and auburn hair‚Ä¶ No one could ignore her or slight her. She was always essentially and indefinably royal, and it seems to me that if fate had so willed she might have been one of the great queens of the world.\\" =Later life= Nawab Azam Jah Following the birth of her sons Prince Mukarram Jah in 1934 and Prince Muffakham Jah in 1939, she took charge of their upbringing, the two princes being educated in Britain but got them married to Turkish ladies. The last Nizam- (Mir Osman Ali Khan) later bypassed his own son and nominated her first son and his grandson, as his successor. The Princess became the first woman to inaugurate an airport when she inaugurated the airport in Hyderabad in the 1940s. She is also credited with inaugurating the Osmania General Hospital. She set up the Durru Shehvar Children's & General Hospital for women and children in the old city of Hyderabad. She also inaugurated the famous Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College Hospital at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in 1939. Her last public appearance in the city was when she presided over the opening ceremony of the Nizam's Silver Jubilee Museum in 2000. She last visited Hyderabad in 2004. She was upset about Turkish Government's attitude against her family members after declaration of the republic. Despite being a member of Ottoman royal family she refused to be buried in Turkey since she was upset that the Turkish Government refused in 1944 her father's burial in Istanbul.(Mainly in Turkish) Ancestry References External links * Telegraph: Obituary for Princess D√ºrr√ºhsehvar of Berar *The Calcutta Telegraph: Goodbye, sweet princess - India‚Äôs great beauties before the pageant came in *NewKerala.com: Nizam's daughter-in-law passes away *Deccan Chronice: Princess Durru dead *When marriage brought continents closer * People of the Ottoman Empire 1914 births 2006 deaths Daughters of Ottoman sultans People from √úsk√ºdar Women of the Hyderabad State Hyderabad State people Burials at Brookwood Cemetery 20th-century women of the Ottoman Empire 20th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Indian female royalty ","title":"D√ºrr√º≈üehvar Sultan"},{"id":"4012066","text":"Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa (born 12 November 1948 in Fister, Norway) is a Norwegian politician for the Centre Party.

It infects Pseudomonas bacteria (typically plant-pathogenic P. syringae). It has a three-part, segmented, double-stranded RNA genome, totalling ~13.5 kb in length. Œ¶6 and its relatives have a lipid membrane around their nucleocapsid, a rare trait among bacteriophages. It is a lytic phage, though under certain circumstances has been observed to display a delay in lysis which may be described as a \\"carrier state\\".  Life cycle  Life cycle of phage phi6 Œ¶6 typically attaches to the Type IV pilus of P. syringae with its attachment protein, P3. It is thought that the cell then retracts its pilus, pulling the phage toward the bacterium. Fusion of the viral envelope with the bacterial outer membrane is facilitated by the phage protein, P6. The muralytic (peptidoglycan-digesting) enzyme, P5, then digests a portion of the cell wall, and the nucleocapsid enters the cell coated with the bacterial outer membrane. Diagram, three dimensional reconstruction, and EM of phage Œ¶6 A copy of the sense strand of the large genome segment (6374 bases) is then synthesized (transcription) on the vertices of the capsid, with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, P2, and released into the host cell cytosol. The four proteins translated from the large segment spontaneously assemble into procapsids, which then package a large segment sense strand, polymerizing its complement during entry through the P2 polymerase-containing vertices. While the large segment is being translated (expressed) and synthesized (replicated), the parental phage releases copies of the sense strands of the medium segment (4061 bases) and small segment (2948 bases) into the cytosol. They are translated, and packaged into the procapsids in order: medium then small. The filled capsids are then coated with the nucleocapsid protein P8, and then outer membrane proteins somehow attract bacterial inner membrane, which then envelopes the nucleocapsid. The lytic protein, P5, is contained between the P8 nucleocapsid shell and the viral envelope. The completed phage progeny remain in the cytosol until sufficient levels of the lytic protein P5 degrade the host cell wall. The cytosol then bursts forth, disrupting the outer membrane, releasing the phage. The bacterium is killed by this lysis.  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) are critical components in the life cycle of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. However, it is not fully understood how these important enzymes function during viral replication. Expression and characterization of the purified recombinant RdRP of Œ¶6 is the first direct demonstration of RdRP activity catalyzed by a single protein from a dsRNA virus. The recombinant Œ¶6 RdRP is highly active in vitro, possesses RNA replication and transcription activities, and is capable of using both homologous and heterologous RNA molecules as templates. The crystal structure of the Œ¶6 polymerase, solved in complex with a number of ligands, provides insights towards understanding the mechanism of primer-independent initiation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. This RNA polymerase appears to operate without a sigma factor/subunit. The purified Œ¶6 RdRP displays processive elongation in vitro and self-assembles along with polymerase complex proteins into subviral particles that are fully functional.  Research  Œ¶6 has been studied as a model to understand how segmented RNA viruses package their genomes, its structure has been studied by scientists interested in lipid-containing bacteriophages, and it has been used as a model organism to test evolutionary theory such as Muller's ratchet. Phage Œ¶6 has been used extensively in additional phage experimental evolution studies.

He was a high churchman but politically radical. He was the friend of John Bright, who praised one of his histories, and of Richard Cobden, and received information from Lord Brougham for his History of the Reform Bill. He was among the first to support the co-operative movement, which he knew through the Rochdale Pioneers, and served as President of the second day of the 1870 Co-operative Congress, the second to take place. Though described as 'angular in manner,' he appears to have been agreeable and estimable in private life.

Its narrator and main character is the real-life lyric poet Simonides of Keos, whose life (ca. 556 BC-469 BCE) spanned the transition from an oral to a written culture in Ancient Greece. Renault's fiction argues that this transition was in part responsible for the cultural flowering known as the Golden Age of Athens‚Äîthough she also gives credit to Hipparchus, Tyrant of Athens, who attracted talented artists like Simonides to live in his city. Renault depicts him as having the works of Homer set down in writing for the first time. The book contains portraits of several other historical figures, such as the mathematician/philosopher Pythagoras, and the erotic poet Anakreon. Plot summary The book follows the life of Simonides from the point of view of his older self. As a boy, silent and lacking confidence due to his extreme ugliness, he is brought up with strict discipline by his father, Leoprepes. He finds comfort in the love of his handsome older brother Theasides, and in music. When a travelling singer, Kleobis, visits Keos to perform at a wedding, Simonides begs to be taken on as an apprentice. This Kleobis does, and they leave together on their travels. Under Kleobis' tutelage Simonides becomes a talented composer and performer, but he remains physically ugly. This proves a severe disadvantage when, after the fall of Kleobis' native city of Ephesos to the Persians, Kleobis and Simonides attempt to find a patron at the court of Polycrates of Samos. Polycrates is a connoisseur of beauty, in boys as much as in music or art, and Simonides' appearance is not a recommendation. Kleobis and Simonides find themselves out of fashion at court, and scrabbling for work. Simonides travels back to Keos to enter a music contest, leaving Kleobis behind in Samos nursing a slight illness. He wins the contest, but discovers, on returning, that Kleobis has died. Simonides now finds a patron in Peisistratos, the tyrant of Athens. He becomes a successful musician in that city, and after Peisistratos' death, his sons Hippias and Hipparchos continue the family's patronage. Through Hipparchos, Simonides is introduced to the hetaira Lyra, whose lover he becomes. Hipparchos himself is sexually oriented to boys, not women, and Simonides witnesses his eventual downfall, when Hipparchos uses his political power to punish the family of a young boy who rejects his advances, and the boy and his lover retaliate by murdering him. Here Renault draws on the tale of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, also known as the Tyrannicides (œÑœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒøŒ∫œÑœåŒΩŒøŒπ), whose attack against the Peisistratid tyranny made them iconic personages of Athenian democracy. 1978 British novels Novels by Mary Renault Novels set in ancient Greece 1970s LGBT novels Novels with gay themes ","title":"The Praise Singer"},{"id":"4012162","text":"Gakuen-Toshi Station is a station of the Seishin-Yamate Line of Kobe Municipal Subway in Kobe, Hy≈çgo, Japan.

The Hotel George Washington, on the corner of Adams and Julia Streets in Jacksonville, Florida, was a 15-story luxury hotel that was in operation from 1926 to 1971. In its later years, it was one of only two luxury hotels in the downtown area. By the 1960s, it was the only five-star hotel in the area after the demise of the Hotel Roosevelt. History On Armistice Day 1925, local businessman Robert Kloeppel announced to crowds in downtown Jacksonville that a luxury hotel would be built. The local firm of Marsh and Saxelbye served as architects. Other investors built the Hotel Roosevelt (then called the Carling Hotel) to compete with Kloeppel, and both hotels were constructed throughout 1926. On December 15, the George Washington was complete. The mayor at the time, John Alsop, along with the current and former Florida governor, were on hand for ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Radios were installed in every one of the 350 rooms so visitors could listen to opening-day festivities, broadcast by radio station WJAX. Kloeppel spent $1.5 million of his own money to construct the hotel. The \\"Hotel George Washington\\" sign, built on the rooftop, was the first neon sign in Jacksonville. The Hotel George Washington, in its heyday, was the center of cultural activities in Jacksonville. The George Washington Auditorium, built in 1941, was the biggest concert hall in town at the time (replacing the Duval County Armory), big enough for classical music events and cotillion balls. The Hotel housed a steak house, a cocktail lounge, a dance hall called the Rainbow Room, a Rexall drugstore and a barber shop. Charles Lindbergh stayed at the George Washington while visiting Jacksonville. =The Beatles= George Harrison and Paul McCartney being escorted through a crowd of fans at the Hotel George Washington, September 1964.

As the group headed from Montreal to Jacksonville, their flight was diverted to Key West due to Hurricane Dora. They traveled to Jacksonville the same day of the concert with no hotel accommodation because the Hotel George Washington in Jacksonville, which was initially booked, was segregated and would not change their operating procedure. When asked by reporters about the cancellation of the hotel, George Harrison said, \\"We don't know about our accommodations at all. We don't arrange that. But you know, we don't appear anywhere there is [segregation].\\" =Closure= In 1964, most of the businesses which operated from the Roosevelt's ground floor moved into the George Washington. Despite the new infusion of business, behind-the-scenes turnover caused the George Washington to fall into disrepair. In 1963, original owner Robert Kloeppel sold the George Washington to dog track magnate Bill Johnson, who in turn sold the hotel to other investors in 1969. After 1969, one by one, the businesses inside the ground floor went out of business. The hotel was closed in 1971 and torn down in 1973. Currently, the site is occupied by the new federal court building in downtown Jacksonville.

Meat slurry is more malleable than dark meats and eases the process of meat distribution as pipelines may be used. Meat slurry is not designed to sell for general consumption; rather, it is used as a meat supplement in food products for humans, such as chicken nuggets, and food for domestic animals. Poultry is the most common meat slurry; however, beef and pork are also used. Properties and production The characteristics of dark meat from poultry; such as its color, low plasticity, and high fat content; are caused by myoglobin, a pigmented chemical compound found in muscle tissue that undergoes frequent use. Because domestic poultry rarely fly, the flight muscles in the breast contain little myoglobin and appear white. Dark meat which is high in myoglobin is less useful in industry, especially fast food, because it is difficult to mold into shapes. Processing dark meat into a slurry makes it more like white meat, easier to prepare. The meat is first finely ground and mixed with water. The mixture is then used in a centrifuge or with an emulsifier to separate the fats and myoglobin from the muscle. The product is then allowed to settle into three layers: meat, excess water, and fat. The remaining liquefied meat is then flash-frozen and packaged.

Deathrow development began in May 1999 as an online PC game. In early 2001, Southend transitioned to an Xbox console release, which let the team use pixel shaders, bump mapped textures, and specular lighting. Deathrow was built on an in-house 3D game engine and was Southend's first full release. The game is based on the fictional extreme sport Blitz, a futuristic full-contact hybrid of hockey and basketball played with a flying disc. Two teams of four players attempt to move the disc through their opponent's goal, and teams can either win on points or by knocking out their opposing team. There are 150 individual characters across 18 thematic teams. The single-player campaign's plot is set in the 23rd century, when Blitz is a popular, televised sport and the teams battle to scale the ranks and win the championship. Players earn credits from their goals scored, opponent knockouts, and crowd-pleasing to be spent on player upgrades, bets, and new teammates. The game also supports split-screen and System Link multiplayer for up to eight players across up to eight Xbox consoles. Deathrow received largely favorable reviews. Reviewers praised the game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained of its high difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others thought it was a highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.  Gameplay  Deathrow is set in the year 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to toss a disc through a hoop while avoiding full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics compared the game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, Blades of Steel, and Speedball, and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball. Action view in a game of the Disciples against the Blitzers There are four rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four computer or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight feet off the ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, and the game continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points at the end of a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted. There are 150 unique players on 18 teams, each with thematic personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and teamwork. Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas‚Äîone half with traditional, open-style stadiums, and the other half with environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field. Players earn credits for knocking out opponents, scoring points, and impressing the crowd with violence and skill. The credits can be used towards player enhancements such as black market performance-enhancing drugs. A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. IGN found the game to heavily rely on teamwork. Computer players on teams rated with low teamwork will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised over the course of a game. Players can call plays including physical offense, fast offense, neutral, defense, and goal defense. The game supports single-player, four-player local multiplayer, and System Link with up to eight players across up to eight Xbox consoles, but does not support Xbox Live online play. Deathrow has a futuristic electronic dance music soundtrack and over 3,000 words of voice acting. It also supports 5.1 surround sound and customized soundtracks. The game is backward compatible with the Xbox 360. = Controls = Players use the Xbox controller's left analog stick to move the character, the right stick to strafe, and the main buttons to jump, block, punch, and kick. When on offense, the latter two functions become \\"pass\\" and \\"shoot\\". Players switch between characters and taunt with the white and black buttons, respectively, and call plays with the directional pad. The left trigger modifies an existing action, such as running into dives, slide-tackles, and grabs, and the right trigger orients the camera towards the objective (either the disc or the goal, depending on the team in possession). This camera control is designed for precision when diving for the disc or shooting on goal. A character in possession of the disc will show a trajectory line of their potential shot or pass, which is altered by player movement, breath, and physical contact. Players charge the disc by holding the shooting button, whereby the disc turns greener as the shot grows more powerful. A fully charged shot called a Deathrow will incapacitate any player it hits, while overcharged shots electrify and stun the carrier. Before each game and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a trailing third-person shot similar to looking over the player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus. = Campaign = The in-game story of Blitz begins in 2197 as a Los Angeles gang sport used to find recruits. Over 20 years later, the illegal sport is picked up for broadcast by the Prime Network, who forms the Blitz Disc Association (BDA) and plans for the first Blitz competition with exhibition games and prize money. Through exhibition games and prize money, 13 teams of humans with various competitive augmentations are chosen to compete. Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team against the ranked hierarchy en route to the championship. Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably moving on to the next division. The player's team receives randomized, team-specific textual messages in between games, including offers for free agent offers, training sessions, drugs, bets on the player's performance, and events including accidental gifts from the player's manager, threats from the team's owner, and organized crime extortions. Players can buy character attribute increases with their credits. Single-player progress unlocks concept art and game assets external to the game, as well as new teams, players, and arenas. Each of the unlockable 13 teams has six unlockable players (for a total of 10 players on each), and five additional legacy teams are limited to four players apiece. Multi-disc and \\"Extreme\\" difficulty gameplay options are also unlockable.  Development  Deathrow was developed by Southend Interactive and produced by Ubisoft. Five friends opened Southend in Malm√∂, Sweden in 1998 to fulfill their childhood ambitions to make video games. Southend began Deathrow development in May 1999 and expected the game to be an online PC video game tentatively titled Blitz Disc Arena. The idea for the sports game descended from a combination of Speedball 2, the Quake and Unreal series, and Tekken. Southend's nine-person team received Xbox development kits in June 2000 and decided to move the game to console in early 2001. According to Southend animator Rodrigo Cespedes in a 2002 TeamXbox interview, \\"Xbox was the only console that would allow [them] to produce the game as it was originally envisioned\\", adding that Microsoft and Ubisoft encouraged the mature direction with emphasis on blood, brutality, and profanity. Thus they began to port the game to the console for its feature capabilities, including vertex and pixel shaders for bump mapped environmental textures and character animations, specular lighting, and bumped reflection mapping. The game was developed on an in-house 3D game engine under construction for multiple years. Each character is made of over 7000 polygons and 55 bones, making for players with facial expressions, over 800 animations, and a capacity to blink. Character faces can additionally express emotions like happiness or anger, and feelings of pain. The move to Xbox led to greater variation in the team personalities. The artists drew many options for each team and the developers chose from the lot. Deathrow was designed for the Action camera view, but Sports view was introduced to expand the game's appeal. Deathrow was displayed at Ubisoft's E3 2002 booth, and was released on 18 October 2002 in Europe, and on 22 October 2002 in the United States as an Xbox exclusive. The game did not include Xbox Live online multiplayer for want of development time. At the time of release, Southend had no plans to release downloadable content, though they implemented a method to do so. The game was Southend's first full release.  Reception  Deathrow received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and IGN's 2002 Best Xbox Game Nobody Played. It was also runner-up for their Xbox action game of the year. IGN felt that of the year's praiseworthy yet unappreciated games, Deathrow alone \\"truly blew [them] away\\". Critics praised the game's fast, chaotic action and use of surround sound. The reviewers bemoaned its high difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some reviewers thought the game used profanity excessively, while others considered it a highlight. David Hodgson of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) found Deathrow European origins apparent as \\"awkward, over-the-top expletives in obnoxious American accents\\" were paired with rugby. Hodgson said that Deathrow struggled to show grittiness in a very shiny environment. He added that the game suffered from immoderate violence, frustrating fighting sequences, lack of online play, and \\"steep learning curve\\". Hodgson compared the core mechanics to a \\"mini-game masquerading as sports entertainment\\". William Racer of the Official Xbox Magazine (OXM) praised the fast-paced nature of the game and its eye for detail, and complained about the camera angles and difficulty. He placed the game in a lineage of invented sports from a dystopian future and found the game more entertaining than the rest. Racer also found the music generic, and the voice acting good. Eric Bush of TeamXbox complimented the computer opponents's artificial intelligence and said that they put up a challenge. GameSpy Osborne appreciated the game's small details like the streak trailing the disc through the air. IGN's Kaiser Hwang called the arena lighting effects, bump mapping, and textures the best since Halo: Combat Evolved. 1UP.com, OXM Racer, and IGN's Douglass Perry and David Clayman recommended Deathrow as a party game, with the IGN staff specifically recommending the game with System Link. GameSpot Greg Kasavin spoke highly of the tight controls and accessible gameplay in spite of a larger learning curve. IGN's Goldstein described the controls as \\"relatively simple\\" and easy to understand within a single game, and Scott Osborne of GameSpy found the controls awkward but easily learned. In comparison, Charles Herold of The New York Times and a friend could not figure out Blitz's rules for 20 minutes, feeling \\"too macho\\" to do the tutorial. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Jonathan Silver thought the gameplay was too frenzied, like \\"NHL Hitz on steroids\\". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's looseness. She noted the game's \\"serious attitude\\" and \\"very gritty view of sports\\", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was \\"one of the nicest aspects\\" of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded Deathrows profanity as the \\"best use of endless cursing in a game... ever\\". Herold of The New York Times noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the \\"savage profanities\\", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games. He added that the game's frantic speed kept him too consumed to curse at the game himself. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Troy Oxford also connected the profanity to the game's \\"'M' rating\\". Edge referred to Deathrow as a substance-less and \\"contrived clone\\" of the 1990 Speedball 2, which used a ball instead of a disc. David Hodgson of EGM similarly praised the 1990 title in comparison. William Racer of OXM did not mind the two games' similarities and added that \\"you might as well copy from the best\\". While Kasavin of GameSpot thought the theme was tired, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Oxford wrote that the game felt \\"fresh\\". Reflecting on the release year, IGN director Peer Schneider said that games like Deathrow showed the games industry's ability to make new, high- caliber franchises. Two IGN staffers predicted the game to be a sleeper hit: one noted the sparse press compared to the game's quality, and the other explained that Ubisoft was busy promoting bigger titles such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Dragon's Lair 3D, and Rayman. = Legacy = In 2006, TeamXbox Matthew Fisher determined that the game aged well. In 2012, Complex Gaming listed Deathrow 13th on its 15 Most Violent Sports Video Games. Scottish developer Ludometrics described their 2014 video game Bodycheck as a spiritual successor to Deathrow, Speedball 2, and Skateball, though the game is set in the medieval past instead of the ultraviolent future. Around the time of launch, Southend was interested in producing a sequel. In March 2004, IGN listed Deathrow 2 as one of its five desired Xbox sequels, specifically for Xbox Live online play support. IGN placed its chances at a 90% likelihood. IGN reported a month later that despite interest from Southend, Ubisoft would be unlikely to release a forthcoming Deathrow sequel due to the original's low revenue. Southend separated from its Swedish IT consulting firm parent company, Tacet Holding AB, and became a fully independent company in April 2013. With it, Southend CEO Fredrik Br√∂njemark announced that \\"now is the right time for Southend to manage its own destiny and to invest in its own products\\", of which Deathrow and ilomilo were examples. Southend closed in June 2013 when its full 24-person staff was hired into Massive Entertainment, another Swedish developer.

Waldstein was educated at Columbia University (A.M., 1873), and also studied at Heidelberg (Ph.D., 1875). In 1880, he became university lecturer on classical archaeology at Cambridge University, and in 1883 university reader. From 1883 to 1889 he was director of the Fitzwilliam Museum. In 1889 he was called to Athens as director of the American School of Classical Studies, which office he held until 1893, when he became professor at the same institution. In 1894 he was made a fellow of King's College. In 1895 he returned to England as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge; and he held this chair until 1901. During his stay in Athens he directed the excavations of the Archeological Institute of America at the site of ancient Plataea, Eretria, where he claimed to have unearthed the tomb of Aristotle, the Heraeum of Argos, among other discoveries. Later he formed an international committee to promote the excavation of Herculaneum.\\"All students of Latin literature may well unite in the prayer that the project of Mr. Waldstein may soon be realized and Lucilius, perhaps, or Sallust, or Livy, brought forth, as was the library of books on Epicurean philosophy, from long- buried Herculaneum\\": Salvage and Losses from Latin Literature, by A. H. Rice, The Classical Journal, Vol. 7, No. 5 (Feb., 1912), p. 211. He was knighted in 1912, appointed as Knight of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog, and appointed Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer. He married Florence, daughter of D. L. Einstein and widow of Theodore Seligman, in 1909. They had one son, Henry, and a daughter. He changed his surname to Walston in 1918 and died in 1927 whilst on a Mediterranean cruise.  Publications  Besides writing the following the books, Waldstein also published in journals numerous reports on his excavations as well as three short stories under the pseudonym Gordon Seymour which were later released under his own name as The Surface of Things (1899). *Balance of Emotion and Intellect (1878) *Essays on the Art of Phidias (1885) *The Jewish Question and the Mission of the Jews (1889, anon.; 2nd ed. 1900) *The Work of John Ruskin (1894) *The Study of Art in Universities (1895) *The Expansion of Western Ideals and the World's Peace (1899) *The Argive Heraeum (1902) *Art in the Nineteenth Century (1903) *Aristodemocracy: From the Great War back to Moses, Christ and Plato (1916) *Harmonism and Conscious Evolution (1922)  Olympic Games  Waldstein competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens in the military rifle event. His final score and place in the competition are unknown, but his first two strings of 10 shots apiece resulted in scores of 354 and 154.

Their main task was to find a way to take Finland from so-called backwoods culture to the new, modern European level of literature. They did not consider their manifestos to form a program of any sort, but instead stated that their group was the \\"new feeling of life\\", building on humility, courage, and the sense of community. The group published their own magazine Tulenkantajat. The editorial of the first issue emphasized the group's unconnectedness to any political party, if not even apoliticism. However, less than a decade later the group disbanded partly due to political conflicts, as some members ended up being strictly on the left while others openly promoted the values of the Academic Karelia Society. In the 1930s, Erkki Vala launched another Tulenkantajat magazine which he published from 1932 to 1939. Vala's magazine was more political compared to its predecessor. Positioning The group's main motto was Ikkunat auki Eurooppaan (Windows open to Europe) and its members visited Europe's major cities such as Paris, Rome, London, and Berlin.

At the point where the brook flows into the Alresford Creek (a branch of the Colne Estuary) stands Thorrington Mill. This is a tide mill built in 1831 and now a Grade II* listed building. The east and northern boundaries of the parish are bounded by the Saltwater Brook. Where the Saltwater Brook flows into Flag Creek (formerly Borefleet Creek or Byrflytt) is the former site of another Tidal Mill.

Among the founders of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), he defended Jewish and minority rights and, though not a Zionist, he supported the Balfour Declaration. He was also a conservationist, and the force behind re-establishing the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, which evolved into today's State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY- ESF). Early life and education Louis Marshall was born on December 14, 1856, in Syracuse, New York, to two Jewish immigrants, recently arrived from Germany.Adler, pp. 21‚Äì22. Founded just eight years earlier, in 1847, Syracuse was a booming transportation, financial, and manufacturing hub on the Erie Canal, as the United States expanded West. On the brink of the American Civil War, the city was also a well-known stop on the Underground Railroad. Marshall's father, Jacob Marshall, had arrived in New York City at 19 years of age on September 1, 1849, from Neidenstein, Bavaria, in Germany; his mother arrived from W√ºrttemberg, Germany, in 1853.Marshall, Louis, Letter to Charles H.

A few years later, in 1885, he became a member of the New York State Bar Association.Handlin, p. xii According to Adler, \\"the day he was admitted to the Bar, Marshall became a partner in Ruger's firm\\". Later, when Ruger was appointed chief justice of the New York State Court of Appeals,Glover, p. 9 \\"the law firm became Jenny, Brooks & Marshall.\\"Adler, p. 25 During this period, Marshall rose to prominence not only in New York, but nationally: \\"In 1891 he was part of a national delegation that asked President Benjamin Harrison to intervene on behalf of persecuted Russian Jews.\\" Before the age of 40, Marshall had argued over 150 cases before the Court of Appeals. Marshall was recruited by Samuel Untermyer, a classmate at Columbia, to join the law firm of Guggenheimer and Untermyer in New York City. Moving there in February 1894, he became heavily involved in Jewish religious and political affairs. He also was involved in alternative dispute resolution (ADR), acting with Louis BrandeisRaider, Mark A. 2008. \\"Introduction\\" [Special Issue: Louis Marshall and American Jewish Leadership], American Jewish History 94(1-2), p. x. as the mediator in a strike of 60,000 to 70,000 cloakmakers in New York City in 1910,Handlin, p. xxi and in 1919 was the arbitrator in a clothing- workers' strike. As his life became stable and more organized he acquired a circle of intimate friends. It was his habit to have lunch and relax at Monch's Restaurant with a group of lawyers during the work-week, where they would debate each other, with Loewenstein, the waiter, serving as Judge and jury.Handlin XVIII, line 12 During the years 1910 and 1911, while William Howard Taft was president, two openings occurred on the United States Supreme Court. Several of Taft's prominent friends urged him to appoint Marshall, who had the reputation of an outstanding Constitutional lawyer and public citizen. A justice of the Supreme Court was the only elected or appointed office Marshall had ever wanted or sought; Taft eventually chose two other men for the positions.Alpert, p.37 In 1914, during a wave of anti-Semitic hysteria, he was part of the legal team representing Leo Frank, a Jewish pencil factory manager convicted of raping and murdering a 14-year-old girl. Marshall initiated an appeal of the case to the United States Supreme Court. Marshall was active in protecting the human and civil rights of Jews and on behalf of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (of which he was a director),Reznikoff, p. 1177 and fought major legal battles on behalf of all minorities. By the end of his legal career, Marshall had \\"argue[d] more cases before the U.S. Supreme Court than any other private lawyer of his generation.\\"Raider, p. ix. The Syracuse Post-Standard's editorial on Marshall, written upon his death in 1929, portrayed his motivation as: \\"Always, it was justice ... Justice to all who were in need of justice ... justice to the people who, like himself, were of Jewish origin. ... His was an intense Americanism. ... He was a man who helped humanity ... unafraid, a man whose hand was ready to lift a load ... necessary for the lessening of misfortune or oppression, a worker in our common life who because he was a worker, became a leader, a man who crowded his years with service for the benefit of those about him‚Äîaltogether an eminent American citizen whom a multitude will hold in grateful remembrance.\\"Alpert =Jewish leader= In 1905, Marshall was promoted to chairman of the Board of Directors of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, conservative Judaism's rabbinical school.Handlin, p. xix After serving as an officer for several years at Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York, a Reform congregation, he became its president in 1916. (Marshall was related by marriage to Emanu-El's spiritual leader, Rabbi Judah L. Magnes, whose wife, Beatrice Lowenstein, was Marshall's sister-in- law.)Handlin, p. xxiv Despite the implicit contradiction, to Marshall there was only one Judaism. In 1906, with Jacob Schiff and Cyrus Adler,Handlin, p. xxvi Marshall helped found the American Jewish Committee (AJC) as a means for keeping watch over legislation and diplomacy relevant to American Jews, and to convey requests, information, and political threats to US government officials. Marshall eventually became the AJC's primary strategist and lobbyist. After being elected its president in 1912,Alder, p. 33 he held the post until his death. In this position, he opposed Congressional bills that would prevent many illiterate Jews from entering the US. Despite a Presidential veto, one of the bills was enacted in 1917, after a Congressional override. Marshall was a strong advocate of abolishing the literacy test and said, \\"We are practically the only ones who are fighting [the literacy test] while a 'great proportion' [of the people] is 'indifferent to what is done'\\". Marshall was also the leader of the movement that led to the abrogation, in 1911, of the US-Russian Commercial Treaty of 1832. At the end of World War I, Marshall attended the Paris Peace Conference at Versailles, France, in 1919, as President of the American Jewish Committee and Vice-President of the American Jewish Congress. There, he helped formulate clauses for the \\"full and equal civil, religious, political, and national rights\\" of Jews in the constitutions of the newly created states of eastern Europe.Marshall, Louis. 1919. Passport application, January 8. These provisions Marshall believed to be \\"the most important contribution to human liberty in modern history.\\"Handlin, p. xxxiv He fought a proposal to have the US Census Bureau enumerate Jews as a race. Although he had some differences with political Zionists, Marshall contributed to efforts that led to the establishment of Israel as a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He was instrumental in organizing the American Jewish Relief Committee,Adler, p. 35 which brought together Zionists and non-Zionists for the management of Jewish colonization efforts. In 1920, Marshall also attempted to stop a newspaper owned by Henry Ford, The Dearborn Independent, from spreading anti-Semitic propaganda.Jewish Enigma - Louis Marshall, The Dearborn Independent, issue of November 26, 1921, reprinted in The International Jew, Volume 4, Chapter 76 at Wikisource Marshall and Untermyer entered the fight against the alleged libelous attacks featured in the paper, which led to a 1927 lawsuit against the automaker in federal court. =Public servant= Over the course of his career, Marshall served in a variety of notable public service positions, at every level. \\"In 1890, at the age of thirty-four, he was appointed by Governor Hill to a special commission to revise the judiciary article of the [New York state] constitution ...\\".

In 1902, Marshall was appointed chairman of a commission investigating the slum conditions on New York City's Lower East Side, where many Jewish immigrants had settled. In 1908, he was appointed chairman of the New York State Immigration Commission. In 1910, Marshall was appointed a trustee of Syracuse University. In 1911, he became president of the board of trustees of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University (now the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry), a post he kept until his death in 1929. At the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1915, Marshall again served as a delegate, this time being elected to an at-large position.\\"Delegates to State Constitutional Convention, 1915\\".

According to Adler, Marshall \\"was the only man who sat in three [New York state] constitutional conventions ...\\"Adler, p. 31 In 1923, Marshall was honored with an appointment as a director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In that post, \\"he fought against racial segregation in housing and against the disenfranchisement of the white primary. ... Defending the rights of Negro voters, he secured a ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Nixon v. Herndon that the Texas white primary law was unconstitutional.\\"Handlin, p. xl =Conservationist= Marshall had both a public and a personal interest in conservation. In his home state of New York, he spearheaded efforts to protect the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains; at the state's 1894 constitutional convention, he helped establish the New York Forest Preserve. Louis Marshall was a framer of Article 14, the \\"Forever Wild\\" clause, in the New York State constitutional Amendment to the New York State Constitution, which went into effect on January 1, 1895.Angus, Christopher. 2002.

The devastating forest fires of 1899, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, which burned provoked Colonel William F. Fox, Superintendent of New York's state- owned forests, to urge replacing fire wardens with a cadre of professional forest rangers. However, it took more than a decade, the terrible forest fires of 1903 and 1908, and the help of Louis Marshall before the present New York State Forest Ranger system was finally established in 1912.Angus, p.120 Marshall was also a driving force behind the establishment of the New York State Ranger School in Wanakena, New York, which was founded in 1912,Marshall, Louis.

Accessed March 23, 2010. he led a floor fight in 1915, successfully protecting the Forever Wild clause of the New York State Constitution. Marshall's interest in conservation extended to the national stage. In an intervention at the US Supreme Court, he had a key influence on a landmark case underscoring the right and responsibility of the Federal government for environmental protection and conservation. In a friend of the court brief on The State of Missouri v. Ray V. Holland, US Game Warden on behalf of the Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks, Marshall successfully persuaded the Court to uphold the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, between the US and Canada.Adler, p. 27 As characterized by Adler, Marshall argued that \\"the United States did have the power to create such legislation; that Congress was well within its rights; and that the Act was constitutional\\"; and further that, \\"If Congress possessed plenary powers to legislate for the protection of the public domain, then it had to take into account all possibility for such protection\\",Adler, pp. 27‚Äì28 including protection of migratory birds, \\"these natural guardians\\" against \\"hostile insects, which, if not held in check ... would result in the inevitable destruction\\" of \\"both prairie and forest lands\\".Marshall, as quoted in Adler, p. 27 According to Handlin, Marshall's intervention \\"was a major factor in the decision.\\"Handlin, p. xviii. \\"It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime,‚Äô Judge Valerie Caproni wrote in a forceful decision.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate- environment/2020/08/11/quoting-kill-mockingbird-judge-struck-down-trumps- rollback-historic-law-protecting-birds/https://www.audubon.org/news/victory- federal-judge-rules-administrations-bird-killing-policy-illegal. In an address at the University of the State of New York at Albany on October 21, 1921, Marshall argued passionately that \\"the people of this State have for a century been guilty of criminal recklessness in the manner in which they have permitted their magnificent forests to be destroyed. The entire country is beginning to perceive a glimmer of the calamity that confronts it if a policy of forestation is not carried into execution speedily. Our water courses will dry up. Our most fertile agricultural lands will become arid. The wild life of the forest, the fishes that were once abundant in our streams are threatened with extermination unless there is a speedy remedy ...\\"Quoted in Reznikoff, p. 1080 At a more personal level, Marshall took a keen interest in the natural environment. Marshall became a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club after its founding in 1922. =Political perspective= Alienated by what he perceived as the populism of the Democratic Party, and the \\"half-baked theories\\" of the Progressive Party,Handlin, p. xvii Marshall was a lifelong Republican, endorsing Republican candidates for election and working closely with Republican congressmen and state legislators.Jewish Political Studies Review Abstracts 4(1-2), (Spring 5752/1992) at www.jcpa.org Although sympathetic with labor he was doubtful about the constitutionality of many laws passed on its behalf. He was suspicious of politicians like Theodore Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson who choreographed their political campaigns to appeal emotionally to the masses; and he considered those in favor of a direct primary or a referendum \\"misguided\\", \\"demagogues\\" or \\"rogues\\".Handlin p.xvii Family life and legacy As full as was his professional life, family played a central role in Marshall's life. =Raising a family= On May 6, 1895, he married Florence Lowenstein, a cousin of his partner, Samuel Untermyer. Lowenstein \\"was the daughter of Sophia Mendelson Lowenstein of New York and Benedict Lowenstein, a wealthy Bavarian immigrant ... She had been educated at The Normal College (now Hunter College) in New York\\".Glover, p. 9. Within a few years, Louis and Florence Marshall had four children: James, Ruth, Robert (known as Bob), and George. They lived comfortably in a three-story brownstone house at Number 47 East 72nd Street in Manhattan, a block and a half from Central Park; the US Census of 1900 indicates that four servants resided with the Marshalls at this address. The children attended the Ethical Culture School across Central Park from their home.Glover, p. 15. Adler relates that \\"... everything centered around the up-bringing of these children. He was a good pal to his boys, and used to play baseball with them, the sport which he most admired.\\".Adler, p. 48 =Home away from home= In 1899, together with five other families, the Marshalls bought of shoreline on Lower Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks and hired architect William L. Coulter to design and build a \\"great camp\\" to be called Knollwood. Many summers were spent there.Glover, pp. 20‚Äì23 According to James Glover, > Since the Marshall family never owned a car, they would travel by rail ... > to Saranac Lake Village. From there it was a mile and a half ride by rowboat > across the lake, or a four-mile surrey ride around the lake. ...

Upon Florence Lowenstein Marshall's death of cancer on May 27, 1916, at age 43, daughter Ruth became surrogate mother for her younger siblings.Glover, p. 24 Marshall found respite in nature: > There was scarcely a day, in New York, when he did not walk through Central > Park; and he treasured the periods he could spend at Knollwood. The silence > of the forest paths brought a \\"healing to the soul.\\" Feasting his eyes upon > the hemlocks and the birches, often he felt as if his lost wife were at his > side, and that made of Knollwood \\"one of the sacred places of the earth.\\" =In their father's footsteps= In adulthood, Marshall's children followed in his footsteps. The eldest, James, became a lawyer, joining his father's firm, later starting his own. James rose to prominence in New York City, where he served on and was president of the city's Board of Education under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.\\"James Marshall Papers, 1930‚Äì86 .\\" NYC Department of Records. Accessed November 15, 2009 James also co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council and authored several books on psychology and the law. He married Lenore Guinzburg, who became noted for her writing as well as discovering and editing the work of author William Faulkner. Together, James and Lenore founded the New Hope Foundation \\"to foster world peace and understanding\\". Ruth married Jacob Billikopf, a Philadelphia labor arbitrator 16 years her senior; like her mother, Ruth died young of cancer, at age 38.Marshall, Jonathan. 2009. Dateline History: The Life of Journalist Jonathan Marshall. Phoenix: Acacia Publishing, pp. 12, 290. Drawing deeply from their childhood experiences in the Adirondacks, the younger boys, Bob and George, became noted conservationists. The sprawling Bob Marshall Wilderness, comprising over a million acres (4000 km¬≤) of pristine wilderness straddling the continental divide in northwestern Montana, is named after Bob, who was director of the Forestry Division of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, head of the U.S. Forest Service Division of Recreation and Lands, and co- founder of The Wilderness Society. George was involved with The Wilderness Society for more than 50 years, and served on the board of directors of the Sierra Club, as well. James Marshall's son, Jonathan Marshall owned and published the Scottsdale Daily Progress newspaper. Jonathan ran unsuccessfully for United States Senate against Barry Goldwater in 1974. =End of life= Louis Marshall died on September 11, 1929, at age 72, while attending a Zionist conference in Zurich, Switzerland. The occasion of his visit to Switzerland was perhaps deeply ironic, as Marshall had been an avowed anti- Zionist. At the time of his death, he was president of the American Jewish Committee,American Jewish Year Book, 1930‚Äì31, p. 154. and was attending the conference in that capacity. Notwithstanding, at that stage Marshall, as many others in his circles, amended his anti-Zionism into a 'non-Zionist' stand, allowing him to cooperate with the emerging Zionist project. Marshall was in Zurich for the first gathering of the Extended Jewish Agency, an institution organized by him and Chaim Weizmann to enhance Zionist perspective and foster diaspora-Jewish identity. True to the values and principles by which he led his life, in his last will and testament, he tithed ten percent of his personal net worth to the \\"Jewish Theological Seminary of America and to twelve other educational and charitable institutions\\".American Jewish Year Book, 1930‚Äì31, p. 151. The Syracuse Post-Standard 's editorial, written upon Marshall's death in 1929, depicts his motivation as: \\"Always, it was justice. ...

On January 19, 2001, Marshall Hall was rededicated to Marshall and his son, Bob, by SUNY-ESF President Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr.. According to Murphy, \\"Louis Marshall is largely the reason that everyone from the college is here today. Louis Marshall was recruited by Chancellor Day in 1910 to make the concept of the 'forestry college' at Syracuse University a reality. Louis was tenacious, prodding both the Governor and the Legislature to take action. Louis Marshall ... lobbied for the $250,000 appropriation to make a building a reality. I think that it is safe to say that Louis Marshall was our father, our first leader and our first forester. Today we rededicate this building to his memory and accomplishments.\\" The rededication included unveiling matching bronze plaques honoring Marshall and his son, ESF alumnus, Bob Marshall. Marshall Street, Syracuse, New York Marshall Street, the anchor street of the business district immediately adjacent to Syracuse University, is named in his honor.

It was first created by writ for Robert de Burghersh on 12 November 1303. Robert had three sons, the eldest of which, named Stephen, became the second Baron. According to modern peerage law, the title would have descended to Maud, Stephen's only daughter, then to her son Sir Walter Paveley, and afterwards to his son, also named Walter. However, there is no evidence that Maud or her descendants ever used the title. After Walter's death the title presumably became abeyant or extinct.

The zoo now is home to 7,000 native and exotic animals and has been named as a top zoo in the nation by Family Life magazine, the Los Angeles Times and USA Today, as well as one of the top zoos in the South by Southern Living Reader's Choice Awards. The Fort Worth Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).  History  When the Fort Worth Zoo opened in 1909, it had one African lion, two bear cubs, an alligator, a coyote, a peacock and a few rabbits. From its opening until 1991, the zoo was owned and operated by the City of Fort Worth. Although the city collected money from the community to purchase new animals, the Zoological society (now the Fort Worth Zoological Association) was formed in 1939 to help raise additional funds. Monkey Island was built in 1937 with funds from the Works Progress Administration. After being refurbished in 1949, this exhibit became a sea lion pool, and by 1970, it had been converted to house small South American mammals. Storks and cranes were housed in this exhibit in the 1980s, and it was converted once again in the early 1990s to house alligators. It is currently being used as the Parrot Paradise exhibit. The Herpetarium was completed in the summer of 1960 and was an indoor exhibit measuring 117 by . Boasting the largest exhibit of reptiles and amphibians in the world (with 175 vivaria and about 200 species), the facility also included a zoo hospital and quarantine room. Features such as refrigerated air, operational skylights, temperature controlled water, switch operated emergency alarms, and state-of- the-art service facilities, made the Herpetarium a marvel of technology for its time. Innovative exhibits such as a display of giant snakes with curved non-reflective glass (creating the illusion of an open-fronted exhibit) were especially popular attractions. The main public area included five exhibit halls covering various geographic regions and another area that was devoted exclusively to amphibians. There were also special exhibits teaching the identification of native venomous snakes and treatment for snakebite. In October 1991, the Fort Worth Zoological Association assumed management of the zoo under a contract with the city. In 1992, the zoo opened the first two of a series of exhibits: World of Primates and Asian Falls. During the rest of the decade, the zoo opened Raptor Canyon, Asian Rhino Ridge, an education center in 1993, a cheetah exhibit in 1994, Flamingo Bay, a Komodo dragon exhibit, Insect City in 1995, Meerkat Mounds in 1997, a new veterinary center in 1998, and Thundering Plains (now closed) in 1999. The first decade of the new millennium saw the opening of Texas Wild! in 2001 to showcase native Texas animals, Parrot Paradise in 2004, Great Barrier Reef in 2005 as part of a renovated Australian Outback exhibit, and the penguin exhibit in 2008. This decade also saw the closing of the original Herpetarium in 2009 to be replaced by the Museum of Living Art in 2010. In the autumn of 2016, the zoo announced its $100-million capital campaign: A Wilder Vision, which will include new exhibit space, renovated habitats, special events space, multiple dining areas, restrooms and most importantly, new ways to observe, interact with and learn about animals. The first step in this plan, a renovated African Savanna, opened in April 2018. Other upcoming projects are an expanded elephant habitat, renovated exhibits for the various African and Asian carnivores, and a new Forests & Jungles section. New species will include the clouded leopard, African wild dog, African leopard, & okapi.

The zoo's Komodo dragons will find a new home here with both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Conservation The Fort Worth Zoo hosts the Turtle Survival Alliance. It was founded in 2001 as an IUCN task group to help stabilize populations of Asian fresh water turtles. It works with countries where endangered species of turtles appear, helping them develop a plan for conserving and sustaining their turtle populations, mostly emphasizing captive breeding and rescue. Art The zoo features an unusual Texas sized sculpture. A furious 40-foot iguana sculpture named Iggy, was lowered by helicopter onto the roof of the animal hospital in June 2010. Created by Austin artist Bob \\"Daddy-O\\" Wade, the sculpture is owned by Fort Worth oilman Lee M. Bass.

She was the mother of telenovela actress Nailea Norvind and the sister of composer and singer/songwriter Georg Kajanus. Early life Norvind was the daughter of Russian prince Paul Vernstad n√©e Chegodayef Sakonsky and Finnish sculptor Johanna Kajanus, who won the bronze medal for sculpture at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937). Norvind, her mother and her brother moved to France when Norvind was 15 years old. Career The following year she won the second prize in the beauty contest at the Cannes Film Festival which enabled her to win a minor role in the film Saint Tropez Blues. She then joined the cast of the Folies Berg√®re and changed her stage name to Eva Norvind. She also appeared in A School for Scandal at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. In 1962, Norvind moved to Canada and then to New York City, where at the age of 18 she worked as a Playboy Bunny and a Can-Can dancer. She finished high school in 1964 and then moved to Mexico City to study Spanish when she was recruited as an actress. She made seven films in Mexico, her last one being B√°√±ame mi amor in 1968. Norvind was the object of controversy in Mexico, when on the highly censored national television she spoke in defense of birth control. The government of Mexico then asked her to leave the country within 24 hours but with the help of the National Association of Actors she was able to stay in the country, although she was forbidden from appearing on television for one year. She performed in two plays, En el closet, no and Machiavelli's La mandragola (The Mandrake). In 1968, she became a photographer covering fashion and celebrity news - traveling to Paris and New York City. She also wrote film articles and worked on distribution of Mexican films to Scandinavia and vice versa. In 1970, Norvind gave birth to her daughter Nailea Norvind in Mexico City and returned to New York City in 1980 to study film at New York University (NYU), graduating in 1982 with a Bachelor in Fine Arts degree. In 1985, she became interested in erotic power exchange and two years later founded Taurel Associates, an umbrella company for counselling, erotic role play and video production for health related services. She gave lectures at national conferences worldwide, to both health professionals and lay audiences. In 1996, she obtained her master's degree in Human Sexuality from NYU. The following year, a movie about her life entitled Didn't Do It For Love was made by German filmmaker Monika Treut. She appeared in that film as well as in the 1999 film Tops & Bottoms. In 1999, John McTiernan hired Norvind to coach Rene Russo for her assertive sexual image in The Thomas Crown Affair for which she got screen credit. Norvind also pursued graduate studies in Forensic Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In 2003, she provided sexual consultation for the film Distress. Death Norvind died on 14 May 2006, drowned in the waters off the beaches of Zipolite, in Oaxaca, Mexico. At the time of her death, she was writing, directing and producing a documentary about severely handicapped Mexican actor and musician Jos√© Flores, entitled Born Without.

The band performed internationally, and released a number of studio albums, mainly with light-hearted pop songs, usually about girls and relationships. History In 1990 K.J. Jansen, Mark O'Flaherty and Mike Eggermont started selling T-shirts imprinted with the Chixdiggit logo at their high-school, although at this stage the band did not exist. Sales of the shirts provided the band with enough money to purchase a drum kit. However, none of the band members had any musical experience nor did any of the members own instruments (except O'Flaherty who owned a classical guitar). Eggermont took up playing bass and Jansen took up playing guitar as well as becoming the lead vocalist for the band. By 1991 the three had formed and band and they started playing a few shows in 1992 while working on their instrumental skills. By 1993 the band was playing regularly in venues around Calgary. In 1995 they performed at a large concert in Seattle, opening for the band 'The Presidents of the United States of America'.\\"Calgary band wins deal with Sub Pop label\\".

It was originally memorized by lawspeakers, but after the end of the Viking Age they were committed to writing, mostly by Christian monks after the Christianization of Scandinavia. Initially they were geographically limited to minor jurisdictions (l√∂gs√∂gur), and the Bjarkey laws concerned various merchant towns, but later there were laws that applied to entire Scandinavian kingdoms. Each jurisdiction was governed by an assembly of free men, called a √æing. The court assembly, the thing, used the law and heard witnesses to rule whether the accused was guilty or not. There were usually two types of punishment: outlawing and fines. The most common means of justice were, however, fines; the amount varied, depending on the severity of the offense. This system was extremely intricate and the fines themselves, singularly a \\"mulct\\",http://sealvikings.wikispaces.com/Viking+Crime+and+Punishments were also varied according to the social status of the accused and/or the victim. Disputes of innocence were often solved by trial. These trials consisted of different tests for men and women. However, as long as the courts were not made aware of the crime, it could go unpunished or was settled outside of legal bounds by payment. There was no written code of law until after the Viking Age, but the code of fines, duels, and disavowing criminals was the standard across the Scandinavian world. Iceland The best sources for information about the Viking legal system are found in Iceland, where it was the most highly documented. The Eyrbyggja Saga, for example, portrays accounts of the compromises made at the Althing. In Chapter 46 of the saga, the arbitrator and his jury facilitate the following settlement: \\"It was agreed that the wound Thord Bling received at Alfta Fjord should cancel the one given to Thorodd Snorrason. Mar Hallvardsson's wound and the blow Steinthor gave Snorri the Priest were said to equal the deaths of the three men killed at Alfta Fjord. The killings by Styr, one on either side, cancelled each other out, as did the killings of Bergthor, and the wounds of the Thorbrandssons in the fight on Vigra Fjord. The killing of Freystein Bofi was set against the killing of one of Steinthor's men at Alfta Fjord. Thorleif Kimbi got compensation for the leg he had lost. The killing of one of Snorri's men at Alfta Fjord was matched against the unlawful assault Thorleif Kimbi had committed by starting the fight. All other injuries were evened out, all outstanding differences paid for, and so they parted on friendly terms. Everyone honoured this settlement as long as Steinthor and Snorri were both alive.\\"Hermann, P√°lsson, and Paul Edwards. Eyrbyggja Saga. London, England: Penguin, 1989 In 1117, the Althing decided that all the laws should be written down and this was accomplished at Hafli√∞i M√°sson's farm over that winter and published the following year. The resulting codex is known as the Gray Goose Laws (Icelandic: Gr√°g√°s) and they were a collection of laws from the Icelandic Commonwealth period consisting of Icelandic civil laws and the laws governing the Christian church in Iceland. Norway Norwegian Riksarkivet. As with the other Scandinavian countries in the Medieval Age, Norway was governed by a system of √æings at which the numerous kings would convene to settle legal disputes. Medieval Norway developed four ancient regional assemblies: Frostating, Gulating, Eidsivating and Borgarting. There were also smaller √æings, such as Haugating, which did not develop into major legislative meetings. A jury typically consisted of twelve members, twenty-four members, or thirty-six members according to the importance of the matter in question.http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/laws.htm One of the most common practices in early medieval Norway of determining the outcome of a case was a holmgang,http://viking.no/e/life/elaws.htm which was a duel between the accuser and the accused. The winner was considered to be in the favor of the gods and thus the innocent party. Although not as common, outlawing men was practiced as well. Bjorn, son of Ketil Flat-Nose, was declared an outlaw by a thing assembled by King Harald in the very beginning of the Eyrbyggja Saga. As royal power in the Norwegian kingdom was consolidated, from about the eleventh century onwards, laws were increasingly put into writing, and later issued by royal decree. Thus trade in towns came to be regulated by the Bjarkey laws; the laws of the four √æings were codified during the thirteenth century, producing texts such as the Frostathing Law. Magnus I of Norway (\\"the good\\") took a key role in this. Then, during the reign of Magnus VI of Norway (\\"the lawmender\\"), the first state law for the whole of Norway was issued, between 1274 and 1276. This is known as Magnus Lagab√∏tes landslov; it was supplemented with further law-codes for the country's cities from 1276, known as Magnus Lagab√∏tes bylov. Magnus Lagab√∏tes landslov stood more or less unchanged as a key section of Norwegian law until the Norwegian Code of issued by Christian V of Denmark in 1688. However, a number of features of the current Law of Norway are still thought to descend lineally from Ancient Norwegian property laws. Udal law, for example, is thought to have ancient origins of this kind. The Treaty of Perth transferred the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Man to Scots law while Norse law and rule still applied for Shetland and Orkney. Denmark Leaf F91r of SKB B74 discussing crimes of passion. Medieval Denmark was divided into three jurisdictions each ruled by its own provincial law; the Scanian Law used in the Scanian lands, the Zealandic Law used in Zealand and Lolland, and the Jutlandic Law used in Jutland (both North and South) and Funen. The Scanian lands were Danish until the middle of the 17th century, and the Scanian Law predates Sweden's similar provincial laws. It was written down around 1200 and exists in several law manuscripts. The earliest extant manuscript, SKB B74 was created between 1225-1275 and is now housed at the Swedish Royal Library. Another copy, the Codex Runicus, was written entirely in runic lettering around 1300 and is now held at the Arnamagn√¶an Institute at the University of Copenhagen. These manuscripts are however copies of older lawtexts and the Scanian Law is thus counted as one of the oldest provincial laws in the Nordic countries. All three provinsial laws were given by king Valdemar the Victorious. The youngest of the three, the Jutlandic Law, was given in 1241. Zealand was later given two additional laws: King Eric's Zealandic Law and the Zealandic ecclesiastical law. It is remains unclear which king Eric the former law refers to. The three laws were replaced in 1683 by King Christian V's Danish Law but as this law was never introduced in Schleswig, the Jutlandic Law remained in force for this jurisdiction. The oldest known copy of the Jutlandic Law, Codex Holmiensis 37 is currently owned by the Swedish Royal Library. Recent research has rejected earlier claims that described this copy as Swedish war booty from 1657-60 wars, as the book appears to have been in Danish ownership during the early 18th century.http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0539.html article Landskapslagar Sweden The earliest written law from what is now Sweden seems to be the Forsaringen, an iron ring from the door for the church of Forsa in H√§lsingland, which carries a runic inscription, long thought to be from the high Middle Ages but more recently dated to the ninth or tenth century. The inscription's precise meaning is uncertain, but seems to list fines, with the fine doubling for each new offence.Inger Larsson, 'The Role of the Swedish Lawman in the Spread of Lay Literacy', in Along the Oral-Written Continuum: Types of Texts, Relations and the Implications, ed. by Slavica Rankoviƒá, Leidulf Melve, and Else Mundal, Utrecht Studies in Medieval Literacy, 20 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 411-27 (pp. 416-18). The earliest substantial Swedish law-texts are the provincial laws (in Swedish landskapslag), which were the means of law holding in Sweden during the Middle Ages. The provinces of Sweden, or landskap were practically separate countries and had individual laws. Provincial laws are known to have existed in the provinces of V√§sterg√∂tland, √ñsterg√∂tland, Dalarna, H√§lsingland, S√∂dermanland, Law of Uppland, V√§stmanland, V√§rmland and N√§rke. A provincial law, Gutalagen, also existed for Gotland. In Finland, the local common laws were not codified, but in parts of Finland the applied law was based on the H√§lsingland law. In older times the laws were memorized by a lawspeaker (lagman). Around 1200 the laws began to be transferred to written form. This was probably due to clerical influences. The oldest of the Swedish provincial laws is the Westrogothic law or V√§stg√∂talagen, which was used in the province of V√§sterg√∂tland, in west Sweden. Like Gutalagen, it was written in its oldest version around 1220. Some regulations are likely to have their origins in the Viking Age. A stipulation that \\"no man may inherit while he sits in Greece\\", for instance, would have been useful during the Viking Age when many Swedes served in the Varangian Guard but less so when the laws were codified, at a time when such service had all but stopped. Of the fine, one third was to be paid to the wronged; one third to the hundred; and one third to the King. In 1347, the Swedish provincial laws were replaced by Magnus Eriksson's country law. Gutalagen was in use until 1595 and the Scanian Law was in use until 1683. Christianity and Norse law Christianity is thought to have come to the Scandinavian peoples initially in the reign of Charlemagne, but did not take hold until the 11th or 12th centuries, when it was made the official religion of Norway by Olaf Tryggvason. He is also credited with expanding the religion to the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland, among other areas in Scandinavia. With the Christians came new laws and ideas, such as the J√°rnburdr, which was a \\"test by fire\\". It consisted of picking an iron out of boiling water and carrying it 9 paces. A week later, if the carrier's wounds had not become infected they were declared innocent. Later, the Christians also abolished this law. It also abolished slavery in Scandinavia and the gathering of \\"cults\\". Perhaps the largest contribution of Christianity to Viking culture, however, was the power that it presented. As the Viking Age moved into a more monarchical era, it came to a fast close. Kings such as the Olaf Tryggvason, Sweyn Forkbeard, and Sweyn's son Cnut the Great were extremely powerful and were Christian. The yearly √æing ritual continued after the Christianization of Scandinavia, especially in Iceland where it was a social gathering, not merely a court.

It is one of two parrot species found on the islands, and one of only five ground-dwelling parrots in the world. They are long-living birds that may live up to 10 years of age, but the introduction of mice that compete with them for food is a threat to their survival on the Antipodes Islands. Unusually for parrots, they sometimes prey upon other birds, a trait shared by another New Zealand parrot, the kea. Taxonomy The Antipodes parakeet was depicted in 1831 by the English artist Edward Lear in his Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots. Lear used the common name \\"Uniform parakeet\\" and coined the binomial name Platycercus unicolor. The species is now placed in the genus Cyanoramphus that was introduced in 1854 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. Its closest relative is Reischek's parakeet, which also lives on the Antipodes Islands. Other relatives include the Norfolk parakeet, Society parakeet and Chatham parakeet. Description It is the largest species in the genus Cyanoramphus at 30 cm (12 in) long. and makes a penetrating kok-kok-kok-kok noise.Illustration of Antipodes Parakeet by Edward Lear (1812-1888). Distribution and habitat The Antipodes parakeet is endemic to the Antipodes Islands of New Zealand. They are common on the main Antipodes Island, but are less common on smaller islands in the group such as Bollons Island. They live in very small numbers on Leeward Island, where they only live in a 0.1 square kilometre region of the island. The Antipodes parakeet also live on the 0.1 square kilometre Archway Island as well. Behaviour and ecology These parakeets eat leaves, buds, grass, and tussock stalks, as well as sometimes feeding on seeds, flowers, and will scavenge dead seabirds. The Antipodes parakeet also preys on grey-backed storm petrels, entering burrows to kill incubating adults, even digging at the entrance if it is too small.Greene, T.

Overview  The township is immediately west of the flood-prone King River and has State Forest to its west and east. Agriculture extends along several stream valleys which are tributaries of the King River.Australian Places: Whitfield At the , Whitfield and the surrounding area had a population of 215. History Pastoral runs were established in the area in the 1840s but population was small until the 1870s, the Post Office opening on 1 May 1874 as Upper King River and being renamed Whitfield in 1889. The name Whitfield is believed to come from the name of a pastoral run Whitefields. In the early 1900s Whitfield was the site of a Government experimental farm growing tobacco and hops. After World War II many European immigrants settled in the area and grew tobacco. Today The township is close to nearby Cheshunt, Victoria, and the localities of Rose River and Dandongadale. Local places of interest include Paradise Falls, Mount Cobbler, Power's Lookout, Lake William Hovell and Wabonga Plateau. Waterfalls, mountain streams, wildflowers and views of the Alps are features of the Wabonga Plateau-Mount Cobbler area of the Alpine National Park. There are tours and places of interest for day visitors as well as those staying longer. Bushwalking, 4WD touring and camping are offered in the area. Mount Cobbler and the Wabonga Plateau area of the Alpine National Park are often approached from Whitfield. From Melbourne, Whitfield can be reached via the Hume Highway to Wangaratta or via the Maroondah Highway to Mansfield and then via Tolmie. Roads from Benalla, Mansfield and Myrtleford. Whitfield has a number of facilities as the principal town of the upper King Valley. It has a hotel/pub, Cafe Whitty (coffee shop & food), police station, golf course and caravan park. It is home of the King Valley football team competing in the Ovens and King Football League.

History =Background= On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers first testified before HUAC about the Ware Group Harold Ware founded this group under the auspices of J. Peters by Summer 1933. Ware was a Communist Party (CP) official working for the federal government in Washington, D.C.. The first known meeting of the Ware Group occurred in late 1933 with eight members: John Abt, Henry Collins, Alger Hiss, Victor Perlo, Lee Pressman, Nathaniel Weyl, and Nathan Witt. Initially, Peters instructed that members make \\"exceptional money sacrifices\\" to the Party, study Marxist theory and Party doctrine, observe \\"strictest secrecy,\\" and to obtain \\"any government documents\\" available to them. (Known members later claimed that it was merely a Marxist study group.) =Known active years= By 1934, the group had grown to some 75 members, divided into cells. Members initially joined Marxist study groups and then into activities on behalf of the Party. They shared a belief that Marxist ideologies were the correct way to approach the problems of the ongoing Great Depression. Chambers also stated that Ware could have been acting \\"pursuant to orders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States.\\" The Ware group started among young lawyers and economists hired by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). This New Deal agency reported to the Secretary of Agriculture but was operated independently of Department of Agriculture bureaucracy. All the members of the Ware Group were dues paying members of the Communist Party. J. Peters considered the Ware Group one of his major sources of income.Alger Hiss: Why He Chose Treason. Christina Shelton. Simon and Schuster. 2012. Nathaniel Weyl felt that members of the Ware Group were acquiring \\"the training in the complex business of running a state that would be in high demand and short supply when the United States chose Socialism\\" and that \\"in a Communist regime they would be poised to move to the head of the table.\\" Ware died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in August 1935. J. Peters, who had introduced Whittaker Chambers to Harold Ware the year before, placed Chambers in charge of the Ware Group. Members of the group joined other \\"apparatuses\\" under Chambers. The group may have folded as such upon Chambers' defection from the Soviet underground in 1938. Some members seemed to have joined other groups, as attested by Elizabeth Bentley, including Victor Perlo and George Silverman. Hiss Case Alger Hiss testifying (1948) On July 31, 1948. Bentley testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) regarding communist spy rings of which she knew. She named Chambers as someone who might corroborate. On August 3, 1948, Chambers testified under subpoena before HUAC about the existence of what he called the \\"Ware Group\\". During August 1948, the only remaining member who continued to face serious investigation was Alger Hiss, convicted in January 1950 on two counts of perjury. Corroboration Lee Pressman during testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee (March 24, 1938) In the early 1950s, two members corroborated at least some of Chambers' account: * 1950: Lee Pressman: Testified to Congress and confirmed his membership in the Ware Group.Hearings Regarding Communism in the United States Government ‚Äî Part 2, pg. 2845. * 1952: Nathaniel Weyl: Also testified and confirmed his membership in the group, as well as saying that Hiss had been a fellow member. By 1958, Stanford University professor Herbert L. Packer noted that \\"the others named as members of the Ware group have consistently invoked the fifth amendment when questioned about Communist affiliations.\\" Packer also noted that \\"Hiss obliquely recognizes the fact of the Ware group's existence, but relies on the post-trial testimony of Pressman to establish that he was not a member. Indeed, that testimony was one of the grounds relied on in his motion for new trial.\\" During the 1990s, two more members admitted their membership in respective memoirs: * 1993: John Abt: Wrote in his memoirs that the Ware Group was a Communist Party unit and that he had been a member. * 1994: Hope Hale Davis: Acknowledged in her memoir that the Ware Group was a CPUSA unit and that she had known most of the people Chambers had named as fellow Communists and unit members. Members Alleged members of the Ware Group included: * J. Peters * Harold Ware * Whittaker Chambers * John Abt * Lee Pressman * George Silverman * Victor Perlo * Alger Hiss * Charles Kramer * Nathan Witt * Henry Collins * Marion Bachrach * John Herrmann * Nathaniel Weyl * Donald Hiss * Hope Hale Davis Harry Dexter White, then Director of the Division of Monetary Research in the United States Department of the Treasury, was also allegedly affiliated with the group. Legacy In 1958, Packer recommended \\"...Inquiry should also extend to the loose ends. Each of the persons named by Chambers as a member of the Ware group should be required to tell what he knows.\\" Such inquiry has not occurred to date, though in 2011 Thomas L.

Cherry III and starring Jim Varney. It is the fifth film to feature the character Ernest P. Worrell. It has him accidentally unleashing an army of trolls upon a small town on Halloween and the plot involves him joining a few children in fighting back. It was shot in Nashville, Tennessee like its predecessors Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Saves Christmas, and Ernest Goes to Jail. Due to its modest gross of $14,143,280 at the U.S. box office, Disney did not pick up the option after their initial four-picture deal with Cherry and Varney had ran out, therefore making this the fourth and final Ernest film to be released under the Disney label, Touchstone Pictures. All future Ernest films were independently produced, and following the financial failure of the theatrical release Ernest Rides Again, the Ernest films shifted to a straight-to-video market. Its opening credits feature a montage of clips from various horror and science fiction films, including Nosferatu (1922), White Zombie (1932), Phantom from Space (1953), The Brain from Planet Arous (1957), The Screaming Skull (1958), Missile to the Moon (1958), The Hideous Sun Demon (1958), The Giant Gila Monster (1959), The Killer Shrews (1959), Battle Beyond the Sun (1959), and The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). Plot Trantor is a demonic troll who transforms children into wooden dolls to feast upon their energy in Briarville, Missouri in the late 19th century. He is captured by the townsfolk and sealed under an oak tree. One of the village elders, Phineas Worrell, an ancestor of Ernest, establishes the seal. Out of vengeance, Trantor places a curse on the Worrell family, stating that he can only be released on the night before Halloween and by the hands of a Worrell. As part of the curse, every generation of Worrells will get \\"dumber and dumber and dumber\\", until the dumbest member of the family is foolish enough to release him from his earthly prison, culminating in Ernest P. Worrell. One hundred years later, Ernest, a sanitation worker, helps a few of his middle school friends, Kenny Binder, Elizabeth and Joey, construct a tree house in the same tree that unknowingly contains the dormant creature, after the mayor's sons demolished their own cardboard haunted house. When Old Lady Hackmore discovers this, she angrily leaves. When Ernest follows her, he learns the story of Trantor and idiotically reports it to the kids. Inadvertently, Ernest releases the troll. Joey is walking home from the tree house when he hears something rustling through the trees. Joey slowly walks and slips down in a muddy hole. Trantor grabs Joey's wrist and turns him into a wooden doll. Ernest finds Sheriff Binder, who is Kenny's dad, and explains the situation but they do not believe him. After none of the towns folk will assist Ernest because they care about the Halloween party, he mounts a one-man (and one-dog) defense operation in preparation for Trantor's appearance. Meanwhile, Trantor captures a boy on a skateboard for his second victim. Tom and Bobby Tulip, hoping to take advantage of Ernest, sell him a variety of fake troll traps, but one backfires on the mayor's sons and Ernest is fired from his job. Ernest, Kenny and Elizabeth return to Hackmore, where they learn that \\"the heart of a child, and a mother's care\\" are the only defenses against the troll. Later that night, Trantor claims Elizabeth as his third victim as he sneaks into her house while she is resting on her bed. While Kenny and a friend named Gregg are walking, Trantor uses Elizabeth's voice to lure Kenny away, then takes Gregg as a fourth victim. Despite parents being upset at their missing children, Mayor Murdock and Sheriff Cliff Binder still proceed with a Halloween party at the school and they believe the missing children will be at the party. Trantor appears there and takes the mayor's oldest son as his fifth and final wooden doll. In the ensuing fight between Trantor and Ernest, Trantor turns Ernest's dog Rimshot into a wooden doll before being driven off by soft serve ice cream covering Ernest's hands. Kenny realizes that \\"mother's care\\" refers to milk and rallies a troll-fighting team to destroy them. Back at the treehouse, Trantor successfully summons his army of trolls while Ernest tries, but fails, to stop them. The townspeople show up; however, the trolls overwhelm and beat them up. Kenny and his friends arrive and begin destroying the trolls with milk. During the fight, Trantor escapes beneath the tree where he summons the powers of the underworld, making him invincible, especially to milk. Kenny unsuccessfully tries to destroy Trantor, who turns Kenny into a doll as well. With the rest of the townsfolk now backing him up and telling him to douse Trantor in milk, Ernest realizes that the troll children were susceptible to the milk, while Trantor himself would be weak against unconditional love: \\"the heart of a child.\\" He takes Trantor and dances with him while the mob watches, filling him with as much love as possible and finishing it off with a kiss to his snot-ridden nose, which causes Trantor to explode. With Trantor's destruction, Ernest is proclaimed a hero. All of the wooden dolls are restored, including those from the early 19th century, and life returns to normal. Sheriff Cliff Binder apologizes to his son for not believing him and Ernest. Ernest is happy that his dog is back to normal as well. Cast * Jim Varney as Ernest P.

He was imprisoned ages ago by a coalition of deities to prevent the destruction of existence itself. Although imprisoned, Tharizdun still has a degree of his original multiverse-threatening power: he is officially a Divine Rank 11 (out of 20) deity, as of Dragon #294. His holy symbols are a dark spiral rune and a two-tiered inverted ziggurat known as an obex. His holy number is 333. Publication history Created by Gary Gygax based on Robert J. Kuntz's dark god \\"Tharzduun\\", Tharizdun first appeared in the module Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun. He would later appear in Gygax's series of Gord novels. Writer Michal Tresca speculated that Tharizdun might have been inspired by Clark Ashton Smith's Demon Lord and ruler of the Seven Hells, Thasaidon, who appeared first in The Tomb-Spawn, Weird Tales, Vol. 23, No. 5, May 1934. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition (1977‚Äì1988)= Tharizdun's existence was first revealed in the module The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun (1982), by Gary Gygax.Gygax, Gary.

Bellevue, WA: Paizo Publishing, 2007 =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition (2008‚Äì2014)= Tharizdun appears as one of the deities described in the Dungeon Master's Guide for this edition (2008). He is rarely referred to by name and usually referred to as the Chained God.James Wyatt. Dungeon Masters Guide (Wizards of the Coast, 2008). The other gods imprisoned him after he used a shard of pure evil to create the Abyss. Tharizdun is worshiped mostly by rogue drow, genasi cultists and elementals, who call him the Elder Elemental Eye, falsely believing that he is a primordial and not a god. Unlike earlier editions, he has no particular affinity for aberrations and his alignment is Chaotic Evil, rather than Neutral Evil. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (2014‚Äìpresent)= Tharizdun is mentioned in the Player's Handbook for this edition (2014). He is listed as an example Pact Patron for warlocks who make a Pact with a Great Old One and is later listed in Appendix B: Gods of the Multiverse under the Greyhawk pantheon as Tharizdun, god of eternal darkness, CE, with the Trickery Domain and either a dark spiral or inverted ziggurat as his holy symbols. Tharizdun is also mentioned in the Dungeon Master's Guide for this edition (2014), this time listed as a member of the pantheon of the Dawn War Deities for the Nentir Vale setting and is listed as Tharizdun, god of madness, CE, with the Trickery Domain and a Jagged counter- clockwise spiral is listed as his holy symbol. Tharizdun is also listed as one of the elder evils in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. Description Tharizdun was described in Dragon #294 as a pitch-black, roiling, amorphous form. As the Dark God, he is described as an incorporeal wraithform, black and faceless. Gary Gygax described Tharizdun as a \\"primordial deity, that of matter at rest and decay of energy, viz. entropy.\\" Tharizdun has been depicted on the cover of Gygax's Gord the Rogue novel Come Endless Darkness as a huge, bald, humanoid man, with claws, greenish-black skin, and pointed ears. Gygax said that in the Gord novels, \\"the worst and most terrible of Tharizdun's forms could come into full power and attack\\". Tharizdun's \\"free\\" holy symbol is a \\"black sun with variegated rays\\". His second holy symbol of an inverted ziggurat indicates that the work of those who bound him would be overturned, according to Gygax. =Other aspects= Tharizdun is sometimes worshiped as an entity called the Elder Elemental Eye (a being similar to Ghaunadaur), but few of these worshipers recognize the two as being the same entity. Gygax himself indicated that the two creatures were separate beings. The Elder Elemental God is described as a huge, mottled, tentacled being, or as a pillar of vast elemental force with a body of burning magma, radiating steam. Relationships It is believed that Tharizdun has no allies, given his desire to destroy the entire universe. Should he ever escape from his prison, it is thought that even the most evil of deities would work with their good counterparts to return Tharizdun to his prison. However, the Dark God has been known to work his will secretly by employing various demons (with or without their knowledge) to do his bidding. Examples of fiends so used include Iuz and Zuggtmoy, and the Princes of Elemental Evil. On Oerth, Tharizdun is particularly opposed by Pelor and Boccob. =Shothragot= Tharizdun created an avatar called Shothragot at the time of the Twin Cataclysms. The avatar was thought to have been destroyed, but in reality it only went into dormancy. Recently freed, Shothragot hopes to collect the 333 gems of Tharizdun and set its master free. Realm The Demiplane of Imprisonment is hidden somewhere in the depths of the Ethereal Plane, resembling a swollen, crystalline cyst nearly a mile in diameter. The ethereal substance surrounding the demiplane boils with the dreamscapes of Tharizdun's worshipers and others whose dreams the dark god invades. Within the prison, Tharizdun dreams of a multiverse where his goals succeeded, where he destroyed all of Creation and rebuilt it in his own foul image. The binding magic is less concerned with preventing his escape - which he could accomplish with ease should he discover the truth - but to prevent any outside source from informing him otherwise. Dogma Tharizdun's doctrine is to destroy all and everything encountered. =Scriptures= Most of Tharizdun's ancient scriptures are long lost. The only one known to remain is the Lament for Lost Tharizdun, penned by his \\"last cleric,\\" Wongas. Worshippers Tharizdun's worshipers are often insane. Their ultimate goal is to free their dark deity from his prison. He is rumored to be worshiped by the Scarlet Brotherhood, though these followers are actually a splinter sect of the organization known as the Black Brotherhood or The Blackthorn. The elemental cults in the original Temple of elemental evil believed they were worshiping the destructive powers of the elements themselves, with a few believing their patron was Zuggtmoy; however, only a few knew that Tharizdun was the cults' true patron. Tharizdun is sometimes worshiped by nonhuman aberrations such as aboleths, neogi, and grell. =Clergy= Like his lay worshipers, many of Tharizdun's priests are mad. Those who are not mad believe that they will reap great rewards and privileges for their aid in freeing him. All of his clerics are extremely secretive and trust only fellow cultists. They lead foul rituals, including human sacrifice, and search ancient sites for clues to freeing their deity. Due to Tharizdun's imprisonment, his priests must remain in contact with a site or object holding some of the Dark God's power in order to use their magic. Their favored weapon is the \\"spiral of decay,\\" a bizarre weapon about which little is known. Those priests who follow Tharizdun's Elder Elemental Eye aspect have used a weapon known as a \\"tentacle rod\\" (a rod topped with animate tentacles), but it is unknown if this is the same object. Temples Tharizdun's temples (often in the shape of black ziggurats) are usually hidden, due to necessity. Known places of worship include an ancient temple located in the Yatil Mountains, as well as a more recently discovered temple in the Lortmils, near the Kron Hills. Although not many people in the Flanaess are aware that Tharizdun exists, it is said that public knowledge of one of his ziggurats would be enough to \\"raise an army of paladins\\". Artifacts Tharizdun has many known artifacts. \\"One\\" that is known is actually many: a collection of gems known as the 333 Gems of Tharizdun. Their current location is unknown, but it is certain that the collection was split up long ago. Other artifacts associated with Tharizdun include the horn known as the Wailer of Tharizdun, the thermophagic sword Druniazth, and the Spear of Sorrow. The Scorpion Crown was gifted by him to the last king of Sulm. Still another artifact, the Weeping Hexagram, is in the hands of the Scarlet Brotherhood. In Gary Gygax's Gord the Rogue Series, there were a set of three artifacts known as the Theoparts, which, combined, could free Tharizdun. Each Theopart represented one of the shades of evil (i.e., neutral, lawful, or chaotic.) History Some say that Tharizdun originated in the Far Realm or in a previous universe. Tharizdun was imprisoned eons ago by the forebears of those beings known as the Great Powers, although it is said that Pelor was also involved. It's said that both good and evil deities worked together to ensure his imprisonment. As the Dark God, he is credited with the corruption of the Seelie Court. Through the Scorpion Crown, he is said to have destroyed the ancient kingdom of Sulm. Tharizdun was imprisoned long ago, but his prison may weaken at times, allowing his influence to creep out into the worlds beyond. Tharizdun's temple in the Yatils is thought to have been originally defeated with the aid of the legendary Six from Shadow.Stark, Ed, Chris Thomasson, Ari Marmell, Rhiannon Louve, and Gary Astleford. Complete Champion. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2007 =Fourth Edition= In the Fourth Edition Monster Manual, Tharizdun is described as creating the Abyss and the demons that live there by corrupting a portion of the elemental chaos using a shard of pure evil. For this, all the other gods (good, unaligned and evil alike) banded together to seal him away. Fourth Edition's Dungeon Master's Guide states that Tharizdun is not mentioned by name in the Player's Handbook or in the Monster Manual due to the fact that his existence is not widely known to mortals. Those who do know of Tharizdun refer to him euphemistically as the Chained God. Most of Tharizdun's followers are elementals or have ties to elementals, and refer to him as the Elder Elemental Eye. The majority of the Elder Elemental Eye's cultists (including Tharizdun's exarchs) don't even know he is a god, thinking him instead to be a powerful primordial. The 4th edition Tharizdun is not associated with aberrations, and the location of his prison is not known. In the Dungeons and Dragons Novel Series \\"Abyssal Plague\\" Tharizdun's prison is revealed to be a universe that has long since been destroyed by that realm's own version of the Abyss known as the Voidharrow. Mildly intelligent and with the ability to corrupt and warp living creatures, the Voidharrow spent eternity alone in this realm of utter destruction until Tharizdun was imprisoned there by the other gods for his creation of the abyss. The reason behind this realm as the prison in which he would be trapped was to leave him in a realm just like the one he would have turned the multiverse into if he had been able to; with all of his power intact, he would have nothing to destroy and an infinite amount of time to lay out an infinite number of plans to free himself, only for him to have no way of implementing any of them. In other media In 2019, Matthew Mercer incorporated Tharizdun as a major antagonist in the second campaign of Critical Role.

In 1830 he was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer of Ireland. He was the son of William Foster, Bishop of Clogher (1744-1797) and nephew of John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and St John's College, Cambridge. Early life After his father's death while he was about sixteen, his uncle, John Foster, oversaw his further education, encouraged him to travel and employed him (presumably part-time) as his private secretary (in an office for the loss of which he was later compensated on the Union with Great Britain with an annuity of ¬£10 5s).British Library, Peel papers, Add.

De Salis (ed.), Letters to the Countess, (London, 2014)). Family On 9 August 1814 he married Letitia Vesey-Fitzgerald, daughter of James Fitzgerald, with whom he had five sons and a daughter, including the Australian politician, John Foster Vesey-Fitzgerald. In the summer of 1814 he acquired his family seat at Rathescar, Co. Louth, an estate where his uncle, John Foster had lived in the 1770s and where John Leslie Foster undertook substantial repairs and alterations. Career John Leslie Foster was called to the Bar in Ireland in 1803 and was sometime a member of Lincoln's Inn. In 1804 he published an Essay on the Principles of Commercial Exchanges, particularly between England and Ireland. He was one of the Commissioners appointed in September 1809 to the Commission for improving the Bogs of Ireland. Between 1807 and 1812 he represented Dublin University, having first contested the seat in 1806. He returned to the bar in 1812, but in 1816 was brought back to Parliament at the instigation of the government as member for Sir Leonard Holmes' borough of Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight. At the 1818 general election, he was elected for both Lisburn and Armagh City. He chose to sit for the latter constituency and served from 1818 to 1820. From April 1818 until its abolition in 1826, he was Counsel to the Commissioners of the Irish Board of Customs and Excise. Between 1824 and 1830 he was the MP for County Louth, and from 1825 was a director of the Drogheda Steam Packet Company. He also acted as Mayor of Drogheda during this period. On 24 June 1824, he was appointed to the Royal Commission for inquiring into the nature and extent of the Instruction afforded by the several Institutions in Ireland established for the purpose of Education where he served with the other Commissioners: Thomas Frankland Lewis, William Grant, James Glassford and Anthony Richard Blake.A copy of the Report of the Commission is available at: http://eppi.dippam.ac.uk/documents/9883/eppi_pages/217631 (accessed 18/11/2012). In this office Foster is reported by the Roman Catholic politician and barrister, Richard Lalor Sheil, to have taken the part of ‚Äúa knight-errant against popery‚Äù whose ‚Äúobject was to bring out whatever was unfavourable to the Catholic Priesthood; while [his fellow Commissioner] Mr Blake (himself a Roman Catholic) justly endeavored to rectify the misconstructions of his brother inquirer‚Äù.R. L. Sheil, Sketches of the Irish Bar, (New York, 1854) ii, pp 260-1. Co. Louth Election ‚Äì 1826 At the Co. Louth Election in August 1826 John Leslie Foster was knocked down to second place in the two-seat constituency by Alexander Dawson, a candidate put up by O‚ÄôConnell's ascendant Catholic Association. After the turbulent election John Leslie complained to his sister that: ‚Äòthe priests attacked me in all their Chapels ‚Ä¶ they made it distinctly a matter of Eternal Damnation to vote for me & an atonement for Sin to vote against me‚Äô.De Salis Papers, 22 July 1826, John Leslie Foster to Countess de Salis, 22 July 1826, published in N.C.F. de Salis (ed.), Letters to the Countess, (London, 2014). The Catholic Association had already gained success in Co. Waterford and this election was a precursor to their further success two years later in Co. Clare. Catholic Emancipation Although John Leslie Foster was (as he assured the House of Commons in February 1829) ‚Äòno Orangeman‚Äô, he was a persistent opponent to Catholic Emancipation. His speech opposing Henry Grattan's 1812 Catholic Relief Bill was published as a pamphlet in 1817. However, following the election of O‚ÄôConnell as MP for Co. Clare in July 1828, it became clear to Peel and the government that continued opposition was unsustainable. Foster was eventually brought round to support the Emancipation Bill once proper safeguards had been offered. On 25 January 1829, Lord Ellenborough, Henry Goulburn, J. C. Herries, William Vesey-Fitzgerald, Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, John Henry North, John Leslie Foster, John Doherty and George Dawson (Peel's brother-in-law) met at Peel's to discuss the matter. If Emancipation was to be granted, a concession was needed and the Forty-Shilling Freeholders' Bill was brought forward. Lord Ellenborough recorded that ‚ÄòPeel told us he had seen [John] Leslie Foster who was for a settlement, but strongly against paying the Roman Catholic clergy. He will therefore support the [Roman Catholic Relief] Bill. ‚Ä¶ Foster [is] consulting with the cabinet how Catholic emancipation may best be brought about!‚ÄôEdward Law, Lord Ellenborough, A Political Diary (2 vols, London, 1881), i, 349-50. On 30 March 1829, when the 1829 Roman Catholic Relief Bill received the Royal Assent, Foster's concession, the Forty Shilling Freeholders‚Äô Bill was also approved. This was the ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô that John Leslie Foster, John Henry North and William Vesey Fitzgerald had helped to frame, but although intended to prevent ‚Äòthe freeholder from being the tool of the landlord, or the slave of the priest‚Äô, it turned out to be an ineffective and unpopular measure. Court of Exchequer of Ireland Foster did not stand at the 1830 general election as it had long been agreed by Peel and Leveson-Gower that, following the abolition of his post as Counsel to the Revenue in January 1828, his claims to promotion were ‚Äòvery much superior‚Äô British Library, Peel Papers, Add. 40336, f. 266. to any others and, following his retirement from politics, John Leslie Foster was appointed as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer of Ireland on 16 July 1830.Morning Post, 19 July 1830. He later moved to the Court of Common Pleas and died while on circuit at Cavan on 10 July 1842. He served as Treasurer of King's Inns from 1832‚Äì33 and from 1838‚Äì39.

He has played for a number of clubs in Danish and English football, winning two Danish Superliga titles with F.C. Copenhagen and the 2006 Danish Cup with Randers FC. He has played a single game for the Denmark national team, and has represented his country 13 times on the various national youth squads. Biography Fredgaard started his senior career with Lyngby Boldklub, whom he represented on the national under-19 and under-21 national teams. He made his debut in the Danish Superliga championship on September 3, 1995. He scored 16 goals in 31 games during the 1998-99 Superliga season, which prompted English club Sunderland AFC to offer Lyngby a ¬£ 1,500,000 million transfer deal. Fredgaard signed his first full-time professional contract at age 22, when he moved to Sunderland on March 24, 1999. While at Sunderland, he played his only Denmark national team game in August 1999. His time at Sunderland was not successful, earning the undeserved nickname Chocolate Fireguard, bringing only a single appearance in the Premier League. Despite some impressive League Cup showings that saw him score two brilliant goals against Walsall (his only goals for the club), and in the next round complete a perfect cross for a Danny Dichio goal, Fredgaard failed to force his way into the first-team, making just one appearance in the league as a substitute away to Chelsea. On February 9, 2000, he was loaned out to Division One side West Bromwich Albion. Back at Sunderland for the 2000-01 season, he was once more loaned out to a Division One team on November 17, 2000, this time playing two months for Bolton Wanderers. In July 2001, Fredgaard moved back to Denmark, as F.C. Copenhagen (FCK) bought him in a ¬£500,000 transfer deal. Unable to hold down a place in the starting line-up in FCK's championship-winning 2002-03 Superliga season, Fredgaard went on loan to fellow Superliga teams FC Nordsj√¶lland and Randers FC. He played one game as FCK won the 2005-06 Superliga championship. When his contract expired in January 2006, he moved to second-tier Danish 1st Division club Randers FC on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract.

The group consisted of vocalist and guitarist Pat Banister, vocalist and bassist Slo' Tom Stewart, and drummer Dave Dudley. In 1993, Furnaceface won the Canadian Music Video Association Award for best independent video for \\"About to Drown\\" from Just Buy It., and another one a couple of years later for Best Editing for \\"How Happy Do You Want to Be?\\" from This Will Make You Happy. History The band, formed in Ottawa in 1989, consisted of vocalist and guitarist Pat Banister, vocalist and bassist Slo' Tom Stewart and drummer Dave Dudley. Furnaceface evolved out of Fluid Waffle, which also included guitarist and vocalist Steve D'Annunzio. Furnaceface started playing shows late in 1989 and released their first single, \\"Sucked into Drugland,\\" on Skull Duggery Records. After releasing this and the \\"New Pad\\" single, they toured across the U.S. and Canada. Their first full-length release was the Let It Down cassette, which was recorded by Andrew McKean, mixed by Marty Jones, and released in 1990. Jones recorded their second cassette in 1991, Just Buy It., and went on to engineer all the Furnaceface releases. After the first national tour for \\"Just Buy It\\" Jones (as \\"Smarty Moans\\") joined the group as a fourth member playing keyboard and guitar. After the original cassette version of Just Buy It. was released, Furnaceface signed to Cargo Records to release a remixed (by Bob Wiseman of Blue Rodeo fame) and re-sequenced version of the album on CD and cassette. Furnaceface also released their next two albums, This Will Make You Happy (1994) and unsafe@anyspeed (1996), with Cargo. Around the time of Just Buy It.'s re-release, Furnaceface decided to start a festival, called Furnacefest, to promote local bands as well as larger acts. In 1995, after two years of performing with the group, Marty Jones decided to leave the band to concentrate on being a producer and co-running Sound of One Hand Studios. After Cargo Canada folded, Furnaceface would release a fifth and final album in 1999 titled And the Days are Short Again‚Ä¶ on their own label Upright Records, which had the single \\"Heartless\\" on it. Around 1999, Pat Banister moved to Vancouver to work as an art director in the film industry. In Banister's absence, Dave Dudley and Tom Stewart have joined with Blake Jacobs of Hot Piss to create Manpower, who perform occasionally around Ottawa. The last Furnaceface recording released to date was 2000's Clobbering Time, a compilation CD of songs from their out-of-print pre-Days releases, from two songs from Let It Down released on CD at last to their cover of the Jam's \\"But I'm Different Now,\\" the B-side of the \\"Biff, Bang, Pow!\\" single. Other area musicians, including Ian Tamblyn and Jim Bryson have also contributed as guest musicians. During a live performance in 1997 Slo' Tom received burns due to an onstage pyrotechnic effect; the show was halted but the musician made a full recovery with no scarring. Tom also performs occasionally as a country & western singer under the name \\"Slo' Tom\\". His band, called Slo' Tom & The Horseshit Heroes (Jim Bryson, Dave Dudley, Geoff Taylor and Graham Collins) released an album, Liquor‚Äôs My Lover.

He was born at St. Ouen de Mancelles in the diocese of √âvreux, and made his solemn profession in religion in 1682 at Notre Dame de Lire, and studied at Bonnenouvelle in Orl√©ans, where he showed more than ordinary ability. After teaching philosophy in the Abbey of Bec, and theology at St. Stephen's, in Caen, he attended the lectures of the University and obtained the degrees of bachelor and licentiate in law. After this he taught a year at Jumi√®ges and three years at F√©camp. He spent the year 1702 in Rome in the study of Greek. The following year he was called to St. Germain des Pr√©s in Paris and taught theology there to the end of his life. His principal work, which he undertook rather reluctantly, is the edition of the writings of St. Irenaeus, Paris, 1710. An elegant edition of these writings had appeared at Oxford, 1702, but the editor John Ernest Grabe was less intent on an accurate rendering of the text than on making Irenaeus favour Anglican views. Massuet enriched his edition with valuable dissertations on the heresies impugned by St. Irenaeus and on the life, writings, and teaching of the saint. He also edited the fifth volume of the Annales Ordinis S. Benediciti, of Jean Mabillon, with some additions and a preface inclusive of the biographies of Mabillon and Thierry Ruinart. We owe him, moreover, a letter to John B. Langlois, S.J., in defence of the Benedictine edition of St. Augustine, and five letters addressed to Bernard Pez found in J. G. Schelhorn's Amoenitates Literariae. He left in manuscript a work entitled Augustinus Graecus, in which he quotes all the passages of St. John Chrysostom on grace.

The species weighs about half a kilogram, one US pound, and is the smallest species of Pteropus at the Australian mainland. P. scapulatus occurs at the coast and further inland, camping and flying to the tropical to temperate regions that provide them with an annual source of nectar. They exhibit an unusual method of obtaining drinking water during dry periods, skimming a stream's surface to gather it onto their fur while they are in flight.  Taxonomy  The first description was published by Wilhelm Peters in 1862, as a 'new species of flederhund from New Holland'. The type specimen was collected at Cape York peninsula. The population gives its name to the scapulatus species group', as recognised by authors in the late twentieth century. Pteropus scapulatus is well known and referred to by many names, these include the 'collared' flying-fox or fruit- bat, the reddish fruit-bat and little reds.  Description  A flying mammal of the pteropodid family, frugivorous bats with simple dog-like heads, often found roosting closely together in large numbers. The characteristic absence of a tail distinguishes these 'flying-foxes' from other bats in Australia. The wing is extended with a forearm measuring 120 to 150 millimetres in length, the head and body combined is 125 to 200 mm. The length from the tip to base of the ear is 29 to 40 mm, and these are quite prominent for an Australian 'flying-fox'. A measured weight range of 300 to 600 grams, gives the species an average mass of 450 grams. The colour of the pelage is reddish brown, the short fur appearing over most of the body and more sparsely at the lower part of the leg. The fur at the head is a dark to light shade of grey. Creamy-white hair may appear at the shoulders, or a pale yellowish patch found between these. The patagium of the wing is a pale brown colour, and somewhat translucent while the bat is in flight. Pteropus scapulatus emits an abrupt 'yap' sound, accompanied by a variety of screeches, squeals and twittering noises, voiced at a high-pitch. They resemble other species found in Australia, the bare legs, reddish fur colour, and the paler near-transparent wings distinguish it from the grey-headed species Pteropus poliocephalus, and the larger and black fruit-bat Pteropus alecto. Their appearance closely resembles Pteropus macrotis, which occurs at and north of Boigu Island.  Behaviour  The largest range of all the species, extending further inland than the others of the family, Pteropus scapulatus will also decamp and roam widely to increase their food availability. The primary source of food for this species is obtained from Eucalyptus and Corymbia blossoms. Their diet consists of nectar and pollen of these eucalypts and is responsible for the much of their pollination, the irregular flowering periods induce the camps to forage in new areas. The nectar of Melaleuca species is also favoured, and they are attracted to other native and cultivated fruiting trees. P. scapulatus camps may become large groups of tens of thousands, with records of some colonies of over one hundred thousand individuals. This species gives birth 6 months later than the other mainland flying fox species, in April and May, this may be to avoid exposing a newborn to the high temperatures of the northern austral summer. The populous and conspicuous camps of P. scapulatus attract a number of larger predators. including both terrestrial and aerial hunters. The sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster will capture these bats in flight as they leave their roosts. The snake species Morelia spilota is frequently found as a resident at these camps, lazily selecting an individual from the apparently unconcerned group at a branch. The bat is seized in the jaws and encircled by the python's body, then swallowed head first to be digested over the next week. The arid climate in parts of the range will prompt the species to seek water in the late afternoon, and this provides an opportunity for freshwater crocodile species Crocodylus johnstoni found across the Top End and northern parts of the continent. A National Geographic Channel special program (World's Weirdest: Flying Foxes) documents that the little red flying fox will skim the surface of rivers, then lap the water from their fur; this can put them in within reach of the crocodiles snapping in the air. The 'freshies', as these crocodilians are locally known, will also place themselves beneath the overhanging roosts of this species, and employ a strategy of thrashing at the shoreline to induce panic and aerial collisions. The species are quick and adept swimmers, presumably due to the advantages in surviving and escaping immersion in water. Larger camps are formed during the breeding period, around October to November, and reduce in size as the birthing period approaches, during March to April. Females start to form separate maternity colonies as gestation advances, and they may join other Pteropus species at their roosts, the births occur in April to May after the dispersal of the larger camp. When the camp regroups later in the year the juveniles gather at their own roosts, joining the breeding camp at the next season when they have become sexually mature. The habitat of roost sites is often composed of wet understorey which provides a temperate microclimate. The 'little reds' will seek to roost closely with others, their combined weight may break branches as they join the camp at a tree. The species is susceptible to heat stroke, and many individuals die when suitable roost sites are unavailable. The disturbance to camps by human intervention during hot weather may cause the deaths of thousands of these bats.  Distribution and habitat  Pteropus scapulatus has a wide distribution range across the north and east of Australia, occupying coastal and sub-coastal regions. The western extent is restricted to coastal areas of northwest Australia, as far south as Shark Bay, and through the tropical and subtropical areas of the north and east to New South Wales and Victoria. The species is only occasionally found extending their range to the southeast of South Australia. The appearance of P. scapulatus in New Zealand is regarded as accidental. The range of the Australian pteropodid bats is bounded by areas of lower rainfall and more temperate climate, this species and the other flying-foxes are absent from the south and west of the continent. The camps of P. scapulatus are found close to streams, they leave these at night to forage in woodland and forests in temperate to tropical regions. A well known colony exists at the Mataranka Hot Springs, an attraction that has also been discouraged from inhabiting the site for the odour of their camps. Colonies of P. scapulatus are recognised as important contributors to woodland ecology, acting as a major pollinator of trees that provide nectar at night. The eucalypts and other trees of riparian zones in the Murray Darling Basin will also be visited in productive seasons. During the austral summer, colonies join the diverse species of bats around the Brisbane cityscape to feed on the blossoms of the pink bloodwood Corymbia intermedia. Along the Brisbane River they share many roost sites with the grey-headed fruit-bat, P. poliocephalus, most notable of these is the Indooroopilly Island, known to be an old bat campsite, whose occupants are seen flying around the area after dusk. They also occupy a well established colony at Ipswich, Queensland, close to that state's capital. Public perception Hanging in a close group This species of flying fox hangs in a different way from other mainland species. The larger species tend to hang an arm's length apart, but the little reds tend to clump together so they may hang in groups of 20 or more animals on an individual branch. So, these animals are associated with significant canopy and branch damage in camps where they reside. They also tend to appear in very large numbers (20,000 or more) and the footprint of a camp can expand rapidly for the several weeks or months they remain at a site. Their large numbers and the damage they cause to a camp site mean they are not very popular animals. The opportunity presented by cultivated fruit trees to wandering little reds may encourage them to return in large numbers if the regular foods are not available, resulting in damage to fruit and trees; for this reason they have been perceived as a pest species by orchardists. Negative public perception of the species has intensified with the discovery of three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), and Menangle virus.Speare, Rick et al. (1997), p. 117. There are few records of human fatality resulting from interaction with bats, limited to the rare and deadly incidence of ABLV, and their parasites find human hosts unsuitable. Conservation Captives roosting together at Wellington Zoo The animals are nomadic and difficult to track, as they tend not to live in urban areas. No accurate method in use currently can estimate the population to determine if the species is holding its own or is in decline. The species is very likely to be affected by the same factors that have seen the grey-headed flying fox and spectacled flying fox listed as threatened, that is, the destruction of foraging areas and roosting habitat.\\"Little red flying-fox\\" accessed 3 July 2011 A new bridge built near Noosa Heads was skirted over by the species leaving a nearby roost, resulting in fatal collisions with motor vehicles travelling across it; a sign warning motorists at the Monks Bridge displays an image of the bat and has subsequently reduced the number of incidents.

Faber & Faber) Ash Wednesday (sometimes Ash-Wednesday) is a long poem written by T. S. Eliot after his 1927 conversion to Anglicanism. Published in 1930, this poem deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith in the past strives to move towards God. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \\"conversion poem\\", Ash-Wednesday, with a base of Dante's Purgatorio, is richly but ambiguously allusive and deals with the move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human salvation. The style is different from his poetry which predates his conversion. \\"Ash-Wednesday\\" and the poems that followed had a more casual, melodic, and contemplative method. Many critics were \\"particularly enthusiastic concerning 'Ash-Wednesday,Untermeyer, Louis.

Among many of the more secular literati its groundwork of orthodox Christianity was discomfiting. Edwin Muir maintained that Ash-Wednesday' is one of the most moving poems he [Eliot] has written, and perhaps the most perfect.\\"Untermeyer, Louis. Modern American Poetry p. 396 (Harcourt Brace 1950) Analysis The poem‚Äôs title comes from the Western Christian fast day marking the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter. It is a poem about the difficulty of religious belief,Raine, Craig. T. S. Eliot (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006) and concerned with personal salvation in an age of uncertainty. In Ash Wednesday Eliot‚Äôs poetic persona, one who has lacked faith in the past, has somehow found the courage, through spiritual exhaustion, to seek faith. In the first section, Eliot introduces the idea of renunciation with a quote from Cavalcanti, in which the poet expresses his devotion to his lady as death approaches. Dante Gabriel Rossetti translated it under the title Ballata, Written in Exile at Sarzana, and rendered the first line as \\"Because I do not hope to return\\". The idea of exile is thus also introduced. Williamson, George. A Reader's Guide to T.S. Eliot, Syracuse University Press, 1998 Publication information The poem was first published as now known in April, 1930 as a small book limited to 600 numbered and signed copies. Later that month an ordinary run of 2000 copies was published in the UK, and in September another 2000 published in the US. Eliot is known to have collected poems and fragments of poems to produce new works. This is most clearly seen in his poems \\"The Hollow Men\\" and \\"Ash- Wednesday\\" where he incorporated previously published poems to become sections of a larger work. Three of the five sections comprising \\"Ash-Wednesday\\" had already been published earlier as separate poems (years link to corresponding \\"[year] in poetry\\" articles): * \\"Perch' Io non Spero\\" (part I of \\"Ash- Wednesday\\") was published in the Spring, 1928 issue of Commerce along with a French translation. * \\"Salutation\\" (now part II of \\"Ash-Wednesday\\") was published in December, 1927 in Saturday Review of Literature. It was also published in January, 1928 in Eliot's own Criterion magazine. * \\"Som de l'escalina\\" (part III of \\"Ash-Wednesday\\") was published in the Autumn, 1929 issue of Commerce along with a French translation.

Eliot: A Bibliography (A Revised and Extended Edition) pp. 39‚Äì40, 218, 219, 223 (Harcourt Brace & World 1969)) =Dedication= When first published, the poem bore the dedication \\"To my wife\\", referring to Eliot's first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, with whom he had a strained relationship, and from whom he initiated a legal separation in 1933. The dedication does not appear in subsequent editions.Seymour-Jones, Carole. Painted Shadow. Doubleday 2001, p. 4. References in other works Vladimir Nabokov parodied Ash Wednesday in his novel Lolita. In chapter 35 of Part Two of Nabokov's book, Humbert's \\"death sentence\\" on Quilty parodies the rhythm and use of anaphora in T. S. Eliot's poem. According to David Rampton, \\"...Quilty's versified death sentence is, in part, a comic version of Ash Wednesday.\\"There was a reference on 'Ash Wednesday' by an eminent author Narendra Luther while interpreting the stanza ...Consequently I rejoice, Having to construct something Upon which to rejoice... wherein he adds that he enjoyed every line, sentence, every page while writing books as they are building blocks for the final edifice.

He was the minister of state for nine years and a cabinet minister for law and justice for five years. At the end of his five-year term in 2014, Governor of Tamil Nadu, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Konijeti Rosaiah replaced Bharadwaj as Governor of Karnataka. On 16 January 2012, he was given the additional charge of Governor of Kerala, which he abandoned on 9 March 2013. Political career left Bhardwaj was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1982. He served as Minister of State in the Ministry of Law and Justice from 31 December 1984 to November 1989 and was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1988. He was then Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Planning and Programme Implementation from 21 June 1991 to 2 July 1992 and Minister of State in the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs from 3 July 1992 to May 1996. He was again re- elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1994 and April 2000, and from 22 May 2004 to 28 May 2009 he served as Union Cabinet Minister of Law and Justice. Having previously represented Madhya Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha, Bhardwaj was instead elected to the Rajya Sabha from Haryana on 20 March 2006, without opposition.\\"Arjun, Bhardwaj, Shinde elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha\\", Tribuneindia.com, 20 March 2006. Political deftness Bhardwaj introduced the concept of rural courts (gram nyayalayas) during the UPA-I government. A media shy minister, the old Gandhi family loyalist handled the most sensitive and controversial cases in the Manmohan Singh cabinet between 2004 and 2009. From Bofors to office of profit and the failed attempt to remove Navin Chawla as election commissioner, were all deftly handled by the Congress veteran to the satisfaction of the Prime Minister and party leadership. Controversies =Bofors scandal= In March 2009, H. R. Bhardwaj was criticized for taking the initiative to de-freeze two bank accounts of Ottavio Quattrocchi, an accused in the Bofors Scam case. In particular, it appears he did not consult the investigating agency CBI which had gotten the accounts frozen. =As Governor of Karnataka= In July 2010, his comments on the powerful Bellary brothers, ministers in the B.S. Yeddyurappa government, particularly demanding their sacking for their alleged involvement in illegal mining generated a national debate. This was preceded by Bhardwaj rejecting the resignation of Lokayukta, Justice Hegde. Bharadwaj also received much flak from the public and media for his unceremonious, scathing personal attack on Mysore university vice-chancellor V G Talawar when the latter was initiating action against former vice-chancellor J Shashidhar Prasad. Prasad is accused of committing irregularities in the recruitment of around 200 professors and readers during his tenure between 2003 and 2007 which are yet to be proved. On 21 January 2011, Governor Bhardwaj sanctioned the prosecution of Chief Minister of Karnataka (Yeddyurappa) under Prevention of Corruption Act, following several allegations of his involvement in land scams and seizure of trucks carrying illegally mined iron ore.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bellary-mining- reddy-brothers-defy-sc-order/1/146713.html However, on 7 March Karnataka High Court quashed this decision and the Lokayukta Police FIR. The court observed, \\"The petitioner was condemned unheard and there is flagrant violation of principles of natural justice, fairness in administrative action and statutory provision\\". On 7 February 2011, Bharadwaj withheld the approval of honorary doctorate by the Bangalore University to noted historian and Kannada writer M. Chidananda Murthy. Chidananda Murthy had backed justice BK Somasekhara Commission's report on church attacks in Karnataka in 2008. Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana 2011, held in Bangalore, adopted a resolution to \\"condemn\\" the Governor's decision. Taking note of this, Bharadwaj agreed to give his approval after recommendations from Bangalore university syndicates.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-07/bangalore/28375512_1_doctorate- governor-forcible-conversion In May 2011, Bhardwaj recommended President's rule in Karnataka after the ruling government lost support in the legislative assembly due to the level of charges brought against it and was forced to prove majority, having a very narrow win. Trivia Speaking at an Editors' Guild seminar, Shekhar Gupta, Editor-in-Chief of The Indian Express, narrated an incident involving Arun Shourie and Bhardwaj. During discussions that followed Rajiv Gandhi's Defamation Bill, Bhardwaj had asked Shourie to be more respectful in speaking since Bharadwaj had practiced law in Shourie's father's court in Rohtak.

He was killed during a British Army ambush at Loughgall, County Armagh in May 1987, aged 32. Background P√°draig McKearney was raised in Moy, County Tyrone, in a staunchly Irish republican family. Both his grandfathers had fought in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, his maternal grandfather in south County Roscommon and his paternal grandfather in east County Tyrone. He was educated at local Catholic schools in Collegeland and Moy, and later went to St Patrick's Academy, Dungannon. IRA career He joined the Provisional IRA and was first arrested in 1972 on charges of blowing up the post office in Moy. He spent six weeks on remand, but was released due to insufficient evidence. In December 1973 he was arrested again and later sentenced to seven years for possession of a rifle. He was imprisoned in Long Kesh and later in Magilligan prison. During this time, a younger brother, Se√°n, also an IRA paramilitary, was killed on 13 May 1974. He was released in 1977 but was sentenced to 14 years in August 1980 after being caught by the British Army with a loaded sten gun along with another IRA member Gerard O'Callaghan.The SAS in Northern Ireland That same year an older brother, Tommy McKearney, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment soldier who worked as a postman in 1977, nearly died on hunger strike after refusing food for 53 days. Another brother, Kevin, and an uncle, Jack McKearney, were both murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries in revenge attacks upon the family.Deaths of Kevin and Jack McKearney, bbc.co.uk; accessed 7 November 2015. On 25 September 1983 McKearney took part in the Maze Prison escape along with 37 other prisoners. At the beginning of 1984 he rejoined IRA activity in his native East Tyrone with the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade. He advocated the commencement of the \\"third phase\\" of the armed struggle, the 'strategic defensive', in which the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Ulster Defence Regiment and British Army would be denied all support in selected areas following repeated attacks on their bases. In 1985 Patrick Kelly became commander of the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade and it was under his leadership that this strategy was pursued. Remote Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) bases were attacked and destroyed, and building contractors who tried to repair them were targeted and sometimes murdered, as occurred with the attack on the Ballygawley police station in December 1985, which killed two policemen, and The Birches police station in August 1986. Death McKearney was shot dead by the British Army on 8 May 1987 during an IRA attack that he was taking part in upon Loughgall police station, which also claimed the lives of seven other IRA members. His body was buried at his hometown of Moy. Footnotes The \\"Third Phase\\" in Provisional IRA thinking represented an escalation of the conflict in Northern Ireland with the eventual aim of using more conventional warfare by taking and holding \\"liberated zones\\" along the border. Due to a number of factors, including the loss of experienced activists at Loughgall and the interception of 120 tonnes of Libyan weaponry aboard the Eksund ship, this strategy was never carried out.

Cincinnati is not only the oldest Jewish community west of the Allegheny Mountains but has also been an institutional center of American Reform Judaism for more than a century. The Israelite, the oldest American Jewish newspaper still (2019) being published, began publication in Cincinnati in 1854. 19th century =Arrival of British Jews= The first known Jew to settle in Cincinnati was Joseph Jonas, an English emigrant who arrived in the city via Philadelphia in 1817. Jonas, a young man, decided to leave his home in Exeter, England, with the avowed intention of settling in Cincinnati. Friends in Philadelphia originally endeavored to dissuade him from going to a place so isolated from all association with his coreligionists. However, Jonas reassured them that he would succeed. For the first two years, he was the only Jew in the Midwestern town. In 1819, Jonas was joined by three others, Lewis Cohen of London, Barnet Levi of Liverpool, and Jonas Levy of Exeter. On the High Holidays in the autumn of 1819, these four men, together with David Israel Johnson of Brookville, Indiana (a frontier trading-station), conducted the first Jewish service west of the Appalachians. Similar services were held for the next three years. Newcomers continued to arrive, the early settlers being mostly Jews from England. The first Jewish child born in Cincinnati, Frederick A. Johnson (June 2, 1821), was the son of the above-mentioned David Israel Johnson and his wife, Eliza. This couple, also English, had removed to Cincinnati from Brookville, where they had first settled. The first couple to be married were Morris Symonds and Rebekah Hyams, whose wedding was celebrated on September 15, 1824. The first death in the community was that of Benjamin Leib (or Lape) in 1821. This man, who had not been known as a Jew, when he felt death to be approaching, asked that three of the Jewish residents of the town be called. He disclosed to them that he was a Jew. He had taken a Gentile spouse who was Noachide, and had reared his children as Noahides, but he begged to be buried as a Jew. There was no Jewish burial-ground in the town. The few Jews living in the city at once proceeded to acquire a small plot of ground to be used as a cemetery and buried him there. This plot, which was afterward enlarged and is known as the Old Jewish Cemetery, was used as the cemetery of the Jewish community until the year 1849, after the cholera epidemic.International Jewish Cemetery Project Retrieved July 17, 2012. At present this cemetery (oldest west of the Alleghenies) is situated in the heart of the city, on Chestnut Street near Central Avenue, in the Old West End. =Birth of Jewish institutions= There were not enough settlers to form a congregation until the year 1824, when the number of Jewish inhabitants of the town had reached about twenty. On January 4 of that year a preliminary meeting was held to consider the advisability of organizing a congregation. Two weeks later, on January 18, the Congregation Bene Israel was formally organized; those in attendance were Solomon Buckingham, David I. Johnson, Joseph Jonas, Samuel Jonas, Jonas Levy, Morris Moses, Phineas Moses, Simeon Moses, Solomon Moses, and Morris Symonds. On January 8, 1830, the Ohio General Assembly granted the congregation a charter whereby it was incorporated under the laws of the state. For twelve years, the congregation worshiped in a room rented for the purpose, but during all this time the small congregation was seeking to secure a permanent home. Appeals were made to Jewish congregations in various parts of the country. Philadelphia, Charleston, and New Orleans lent their assistance. Contributions were even received from Portsmouth, England, from where a number of Cincinnatians had emigrated, and from Barbados in the West Indies. On June 11, 1835, the cornerstone of the first synagogue was laid, and on September 9, 1836, the synagogue was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies. The members of the congregation had conducted the services up to this time. The first official reader was Joseph Samuels. He served a very short time, and was succeeded by Henry Harris, who was followed in 1838 by Hart Judah. The first benevolent association in Cincinnati was organized in 1838 with Phineas Moses as president: its object was to assist needy coreligionists. The first religious school was established in 1842, Mrs. Louisa Symonds becoming its first superintendent. This school was short-lived. In 1845, a Talmud Torah school was established, which gave way the following year to the Hebrew Institute, established by James K. Gutheim. This also flourished but a short time; when Gutheim departed for New Orleans, the institute closed. Isaac M. Wise, the rabbi of the Plum Street Temple During the 1830s, quite a number of German Jews arrived in the city. On September 19, 1841, the B'nai Yeshurun congregation was organized by the Germans, and was incorporated under the laws of the state February 28, 1842. The first reader was Simon Bamberger. In 1847, James K. Gutheim was elected lecturer and reader of the congregation. He served till 1848, and was succeeded by H. A. Henry and A. Rosenfeld. =Rabbi Isaac Wise= In April 1854, Isaac Mayer Wise became the first rabbi of the B'ne Yeshurun congregation. In that same year, Wise's brother-in-law, Edward Bloch, followed him to Cincinnati, collaborating on the production side of The Israelite and eventually founding what at the time was the largest Jewish publisher in the country, Bloch Publishing Company. The efforts of these men, aided by Max Lilienthal, who was hired by B'ne Israel the following year, and Jacob Ezekiel, who moved to Cincinnati in 1868 to assist Wise with his college project, made Cincinnati the intellectual capital of American Judaism. The first association of American synagogues, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, was born in Cincinnati in 1873. The first Jewish institute of higher education, the Hebrew Union College, opened in 1875, followed by the Hebrew Sabbath-School Union in 1886 and the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889. Manischevitz, the first to automate matzoh baking, opened in 1888. Early headquarters for the Manischewitz Bakery, in Cincinnati, 1926 The Israelite began publication in 1854. After The Occident gave up in 1861 trying to replace the weekly Asmonean (ceased in 1858) and returned to its monthly format, until 1875, when The Jewish Week appeared, The Israelite was the only Jewish weekly in the country. Like the Forverts later, it published fiction and essays as well as news. Its only intellectual competitor, the monthly Occident, ceased in 1869. With its supplement in German, Die Deborah, The Israelite was the only bilingual Jewish publication in the United States. The importance of Cincinnati for American Judaism at the time is somewhat obscured by subsequent developments. What happened in Cincinnati is thought of now as the birth of Reform Judaism in America, but at the time it was not so viewed. This was American Judaism, full stop. These were the only Jewish institutions. Wise was creating a Union of American Hebrew Congregations, not the Union for Reform Judaism it later became. The first project of this \\"union\\" was the creation of the Hebrew Union College. It was no secret that there were more reform-minded rabbis and other more conservative rabbis, but they were all rabbis. American Judaism was not yet split into subgroupings (Reform, Conservative, etc.), nor was there a feeling that eventually it would be. To the contrary, Rabbi Wise wanted and worked for unity. The deaths of Joseph Ezekiel in 1899 and Rabbi Wise in 1900 mark the end of the period. Bloch Publishing moved to New York City in 1901.Robert Singerman, ‚ÄúBloch & Company: Pioneer Jewish Publishing House in the West‚Äù , Jewish Book Annual, Vol. 52, pp.110-130 (1994-95). In 1951, the UAHC (now called the Union for Reform Judaism) moved its headquarters to the demographic center of American Jewry in New York City.URJ - History . Under pressure from the great wave of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, where Jewish reform was almost unknown, Reform Judaism became much less audacious than it had been in Cincinnati in the 2nd half of the 19th century, when it was still reform and not Reform Judaism. And Jewish unity was gone, apparently for good. The Plum Street Temple Early 20th Century photo of Plum Street Temple designed by Cincinnati architect James Keys Wilson The former Temple K.K. Bene Isra designed by Cincinnati architect Rudolph Tietig In 1866, the congregation built the architecturally notable Plum Street Temple, as the Isaac M. Wise Temple. Dr. Lilienthal died in office April 5, 1882. He was succeeded as rabbi of the Congregation B'ne Israel by Raphael Benjamin, who served till November 1888, when David Philipson, took charge of the congregation. Dr. Wise served as rabbi of the B'ne Yeshurun congregation till the day of his death, March 26, 1900, being succeeded by his associate, Louis Grossman. Dr. Grossman had been preceded as associate rabbi by Rabbi Charles S. Levi, who served from September 1889 to September 1898. Educational work The other congregations of the city, which continued to adhere to Orthodoxy, were the Adath Israel, organized in 1847; the Ahabath Achim, organized in 1848; and the Sherith Israel, organized in 1855. There were also a number of smaller congregations. Each of these congregations conducted its own religious school, and there were also two free religious schools; one holding its sessions in the schoolrooms of the Mound Street Temple (B'ne Israel), and the other, conducted under the auspices of the local branch of the Council of Jewish Women, meeting at the Jewish Settlement. One of these congregations enjoys the distinction of having petitioned overseas halakhic authority Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin regarding the appropriate manner in which to inaugurate a Torah scroll in the synagogue. [R. Berlin's response is published in his She'elot Uteshuvot Meshiv Davar, I, no. 16, and possesses practical halakhic ramifications until today, as explained by Rabbi J. David Bleich in the latter's Contemporary Halakhic Problems V, p. 386.] A large Talmud Torah school was conducted by the Talmud Torah Association on Barr Street. Night classes for various English and industrial branches of study were a feature of the work of the Jewish Settlement. The Jewish Kitchen Garden Association conducted a large school for girls in the building of the United Jewish Charities every Sunday morning, where instruction is given in dressmaking, millinery, housekeeping, cooking, stenography, typewriting, and allied subjects. An industrial school for girls was conducted during the summer months in the vestry-rooms of the Plum street temple (B'ne Yeshurun), and one for boys during the school year in the Ohio Mechanics Institute building. There was a training-school for nurses in connection with the Jewish Hospital. The Jewish charities of Cincinnati were exceptionally well organized. All the relief and educational agencies joined their forces in April 1896, and formed the United Jewish Charities. This body comprised the following federated societies: Hebrew General Relief Association, Jewish Ladies‚Äô Sewing Society, Jewish Foster Home, Jewish Kitchen Garden Association, Boys‚Äô Industrial School, Girls‚Äô Industrial School, and Society for the Relief of Jewish Sick Poor. The United Charities also granted an annual subvention to the Denver Hospital for Consumptives and to the local Jewish Settlement Association. The seat of the National Jewish Charities is also in Cincinnati, where the national organization was called into being in May 1899. Besides the United Jewish Charities, Cincinnati supported the Jewish Hospital and the Home for the Jewish Aged and Infirm, and was one of the largest contributors to the Jewish Orphan Asylum at Cleveland. The Jews of Cincinnati participated actively in civic life and filled many local positions of trust, as well as state, judicial, and governmental offices. Henry Mack, Charles Fleischmann, James Brown, and Alfred M. Cohen were elected members of the State Senate, and Joseph Jonas, Jacob Wolf, Daniel Wolf, and Harry M. Hoffheimer served in the State House of Representatives. Jacob Shroder was judge of the court of common pleas for a number of years, and Frederick S. Spiegel held the same position as of 1902. Julius Fleischmann was the mayor of the city. Nathaniel Newburgh was appointed appraiser of merchandise by President Cleveland during his first administration, and Bernhard Bettmann was collector of internal revenue since 1897. Lewis S. Rosenstiel, a grandson of Frederick A. Johnson‚Äîthe first Jew born in the city, was the founder and chairman of Schenley Industries and was the nation's largest distiller for half of the twentieth-century. In 1900, the estimated Jewish population of the city stood around 15,000, in a total population of 325,902. By 2008, the estimated Jewish population of the Cincinnati metropolitan area stood around 27,000. Newspapers The second Jewish newspaper in the United States was the English-language The Israelite, established in Cincinnati in 1854. (The first was the Asmonean.) It was founded by Rabbi Wise and (after its initial issues, which were published by Charles F. Schmidt), it began to be published by Edward Bloch with the issue of July 27, 1855. Rabbi Wise also founded (and Bloch published) the German- language Die Deborah in 1855. The Israelite was renamed The American Israelite in 1874. Rabbi Wise's son Leo Wise took over as its publisher from 1883‚Äì1884, and then he did so again, permanently, in 1888. The American Israelite still exists and is the longest-running Jewish newspaper in the United States. Another newspaper, The Sabbath Visitor, established 1874, was discontinued in 1892. The \\"Every Friday\\" newspaper was an Anglo-Jewish newspaper of Jewish affairs, founded and published by Mr. Samuel M. Schmidt in the Cincinnati area between 1927 through 1965. It was considered by most to be a newspaper for the Orthodox Jews in Cincinnati and surrounding areas. Businesses The B. Manischewitz Company, LLC was founded by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz, in Cincinnati in 1888. Their original product, the square matzah, revolutionized matzoh making. Previously matzot were hand rolled and trimmed. In the late 1800s Jewish Russian immigrant David Kadetz settled in Cincinnati, and offered his flair for cooking at the renowned St. Nicolas Hotel. A Cincinnati culinary institution, Kadetz' Kosher, opened in 1901 as the first kosher restaurant west of the Alleghenies. 20th century =Notable Cincinnati Jews= * Theda Bara - American silent film and stage actress * Steven Spielberg - Academy Award-winning film director * Sarah Jessica Parker - Emmy award- winning American actress * Jerry Rubin - American social activist, anti-war leader, and counterculture icon * Jerry Springer - 56th Mayor of Cincinnati (1977‚Äì78) * Albert Sabin - Medical researcher who developed oral polio vaccine * Joseph Strauss - Chief structural engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge * Isaac Mayer Wise - Rabbi, editor, author, and founder of Reform Judaism * Kevin Youkilis - 3x All-Star, 2x World Series Champion baseball player Notes References Jewish Encyclopedia :By : Cyrus Adler & David Philipson External links *Hidden Jewish Cincinnati *Jewish Federation of Cincinnati *David's Voice - The Voice of Cincinnati's Jewish Community *The Jewish Community of Cincinnati, The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot * Die Deborah is a digitized periodical at the Leo Baeck Institute Jewish Cincinnati ","title":"History of the Jews in Cincinnati"},{"id":"4012739","text":"Ernest I (died 31 March or 31 May 1015) was the Duke of Swabia (1012-1015).

Roosevelt moved the Thanksgiving holiday one week earlier than normal, believing that doing so would help bolster retail sales during one of the final years of the Great Depression. This led to much upheaval and protest, causing some to deride the holiday as Franksgiving. The term Franksgiving is a portmanteau of Franklin and Thanksgiving and was coined by Atlantic City mayor Charles D. White in 1939. In 1941, Congress reversed the move by setting Thanksgiving to the fourth Thursday of November.  History  In August 1939, Lew Hahn, general manager of the Retail Dry Goods Association, warned Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins that the late calendar date of Thanksgiving that year (November 30) could possibly have an adverse effect on retail sales. At the time, it was considered bad form for retailers to display Christmas decorations or have \\"Christmas\\" sales before the celebration of Thanksgiving, a phenomenon today referred to as \\"Christmas creep\\". In keeping with a custom begun by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, U.S. Presidents had declared a general day of thanksgiving to be observed on the last Thursday in November. By late August of that year, President Roosevelt decided to deviate from this custom and declare November 23, the second-to-last Thursday, as Thanksgiving that year. The plan encountered immediate opposition. Alf Landon, Roosevelt's Republican challenger in the preceding election, called the declaration \\"another illustration of the confusion which [Roosevelt's] impulsiveness has caused so frequently during his administration. If the change has any merit at all, more time should have been taken working it out... instead of springing it upon an unprepared country with the omnipotence of a Hitler.\\" While not all critics were political opponents of the president, most parts of New England (then a Republican stronghold relative to the rest of the nation) were among the most vocal areas. James Frasier, the chairman of the selectmen of Plymouth, Massachusetts (the location of the first Thanksgiving holidayWilliam Bradford, History of Plimoth Plantation, Anno 1621) \\"heartily disapproved\\". The short-notice change in dates affected the holiday plans of millions of Americans. For example, many college football teams routinely ended their seasons with rivalry games on Thanksgiving, and had scheduled them that year for the last day in November; some athletic conferences had rules permitting games only through the Saturday following Thanksgiving. If the date were changed, many of these teams would play their games for empty stadiums or not at all. The change also caused problems for college registrars, schedulers, and calendar makers. A late 1939 Gallup poll indicated that Democrats favored the switch 52% to 48%, while Republicans opposed it 79% to 21%, and that Americans overall opposed the change 62% to 38%. After announcing August 31, 1939, that he would similarly designate November 21, 1940 (the next year), Roosevelt issued on October 31 his official proclamation calling for \\"a day of general thanksgiving\\" on November 23. Such declarations amount to using the \\"moral authority\\" of the Presidency, and each state government can independently determine when to cancel work for state (and in some cases, municipal) employees. Twenty-three states' governments and the District of Columbia recognized the non-traditional date, twenty-two states preserved the traditional date on November 30, and the remaining three - Colorado, Mississippi, and Texas - gave holidays in both weeks. In 1940, 32 states' governments and the District of Columbia observed the earlier date on November 21, while 16 states chose what some were calling the \\"Republican\\" Thanksgiving on the 28th. A 1941 Commerce Department survey found no significant expansion of retail sales due to the change. November of that year once again saw 32 states and the District of Columbia observing the holiday on the 20th, while the remaining 16 states did so on the 27th. Roughly two in seven last Thursdays of November are the fifth Thursday of that month; in 1939, the fourth (but second to last) Thursday had been named in the presidential proclamation, in lieu of that year's fifth (and last) Thursday. The second and third of the then non-traditional Thanksgivings remain outliers. Specifically, the presidential proclamation of November 9, 1940 and November 8, 1941 called for observances on November 21, 1940 and November 20, 1941, respectively, the third (and second to last) Thursdays. Every such holiday in the 20th century until 1939 had fit into the former tradition, and each year from 1942 on employed the traditional fourth-Thursday celebration. That new approach was embodied in a joint resolution of Congress, signed into law by President Roosevelt on November 26, 1941, and designating the fourth Thursday in November of each year as Thanksgiving Day. (Prior to that in the 20th century, the phrase \\"Thanksgiving Day\\" had been used in the prose of the presidential proclamation only in Calvin Coolidge's first, among his six.) In November 1942, Roosevelt's proclamation made mention of the joint resolution, and of the date it established as Thanksgiving Day, and called for observation \\"in prayer\\" of both it and the New Year's Day to follow. The majority of states immediately changed their laws to coincide with the nationally observed date. The first year following the joint resolution with five Thursdays in November was 1944, and Thanksgiving was observed on the 23rd of the month with the exception of the States of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. (The nation was in the midst of World War II, and most nationwide celebrations as well as many regional ones were on hiatus at the time. It would not be until after the end of the war, 1945, that the new date of Thanksgiving would fully take root.) Also in 1945, 1950, 1951, and 1956, November had five Thursdays. Texas was the last state to change its law, observing the last-Thursday Thanksgiving for the final time in 1956.  In media  In a number of popular radio shows of the time, such as those featuring Burns and Allen and Jack Benny, the confusion over when to observe Thanksgiving Day was the source for jokes. In the 1940 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon Holiday Highlights, directed by Tex Avery, the introduction to a segment about Thanksgiving shows the holiday falling on two different dates, one \\"for Democrats\\" and one a week later \\"for Republicans.\\" The competing dates for Thanksgiving are parodied in the 1942 film Holiday Inn. In the film, a November calendar appears on which an animated turkey jumps back and forth between the two weeks, until he gives up and shrugs his shoulders at the audience. In the 1940 Three Stooges short film No Census, No Feeling, Curly makes mention of the Fourth of July being in October. When Moe questions him, Curly replies, \\"You never can tell. Look what they did to Thanksgiving!\\" In the 2001 HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, the character Joe Toye, a paratrooper of E \\"Easy\\" Company of the 101st Airborne Division, quipping about ending the war quickly, says \\"Hitler gets one of these [knives] right across the windpipe, Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving to Joe Toye Day, pays me ten grand a year for the rest of my fucking life.\\"  References   External links  * Letters, postcards, and telegrams received by Roosevelt concerning his decision Great Depression in the United States Public holidays in the United States Thanksgiving (United States) Presidency of Franklin D.

It is located on the south-eastern slope of the Sierra de G√°dor, 10 miles north-east of Adra.  History  Berja may have Phoenician or Iberian origins; it was known to the Romans as Vergis or Vergium, and it was part of the province of Baetica. There are Roman remains in the Villa Vieja: an amphitheater and an aqueduct, and mosaics whose style and production are similar to those found in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Church of Berja Saint Ctesiphon (San Tesif√≥n), patron saint of the town, is said to have preached in the area in the first century, bringing Christianity to the town. From this era are conserved coins, crosses and a sarcophagus found in the neighborhood of Alcaudique, which is now in the National Archaeological Museum (Museo Arqueol√≥gico Nacional). A reproduction exists in the Museum of Almer√≠a. The site suffered an earthquake in the fifth century, and the Roman town subsequently dissolved into various smaller communities, one of which ‚ÄìBerja- became the dominant one. After the Moorish invasion of Iberia in the eighth century, the town was known as Berja, and a fortress was built in the town. Remains of Moorish baths can still be seen in the neighborhood of Benej√≠. It was occupied by Christian forces in 1489 during the Reconquista. The Morisco Revolt in 1568 led to many deaths in Berja, which was nearly depopulated after the end of the uprising. In autumn of 1588 two hermits arrived in Berja named Domingo de San Juan and Juan de Santa Mar√≠a, who founded in the depopulated area of Pixnela the sanctuary dedicated to a patroness of Berja: the Virgen de G√°dor (Virgin of G√°dor, also in Almeria province). Berja would be administered from Ug√≠jar until October 29, 1753, when it was allowed to have its own mayor, forming part of the administrative area of Las Alpujarras, within the old kingdom of Granada. On August 25, 1804, another earthquake destroyed much of the town. Under the regency of Maria Christina of Austria, Javier de Burgos used his influence to turn Spain's antiquated administrative system into a provincial one, advocating the need for a centralized government. In 1833, Las Alpujarras was divided into two zones: one remained part of the province of Granada, Berja fell within the other which was part of the province of Almer√≠a. Exploitation of the lead mines in Berja began in the 19th century, and the city consequently flourished during this time.  Ecclesiastical history  Saint Ctesiphon (San Tesif√≥n), patron saint of the town, is said to have preached in the area in the first century, bringing Christianity to Roman Vergi(um). It was made a bishopric around 500, but that was suppressed circa 711, due to the Moorish conquest. No resident incumbents available. = Titular see = In 1969 the diocese was nominally restored as Titular bishopric named Vergi (Curiate Italian), Latin adjective Vergen(sis).

It is a game very similar to nine-ball, but more difficult, using 10 balls instead of nine, and with the 10 ball instead of the nine as the \\"\\". Ten-ball is preferred over nine-ball by some professionals\\"Predator World 10-Ball Championship Announced\\" (Dragon Promotions press release), as reported by AZBilliards, February 27, 2007; accessed March 5, 2007 as a more challenging discipline than nine-ball, Web republication of a BCA press release. because it is slightly harder to any balls on the with the more crowded , the initial shooter cannot instantly win the game by pocketing the 10 on the break, all shots must be , and performing a string of on successive racks is statistically more difficult to achieve. Although the game has existed for a long time, its popularity has risen in recent years as a result of concerns that nine-ball has suffered as a result of flaws in its fundamental structure (particularly the ease with which players can often make balls from the break). The World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) World Standardized Rules for 10-ball are very similar to those for nine-ball, but with key changes to ensure the difficulty of the game and its marketability as an alternative to nine-ball. Racking The 10 balls are racked in a triangleABS-CBNNews.com, \\"World Ten Ball Kicks Off in Manila; 128 in Main Draw\\" as in the game of eight-ball (but with 10 instead of 15 object balls, forming a tetractys), with the 1 ball positioned at the apex of the rack, the 2 and 3 balls on the bottom corners of the triangle (non- specific), the 10 ball positioned in the middle of the rack, and the other balls placed randomly throughout, with the apex ball on the foot spot. Play Most of the same rules apply as in nine-ball. This means that in order to establish a legal hit, the cue ball must contact the lowest numbered ball first, and subsequently at least one ball must hit any rail or be pocketed, without the cue ball being pocketed. In 10-ball, shots have to be , which means that the player must call a ball and the pocket in which to make the ball, usually by pointing to a pocket with his finger or cue, and stating the number of the ball he intends to make in that pocket (not necessarily the lowest-numbered ball on the table, e.g. if a combination or carom shot is being attempted). If the 10 ball is pocketed on the break, it will be spotted and the player will continue his inning (previously a 10 ball made on the break resulted in a win). Under WPA World Standardized Rules, it is a game, in which , or shots that go in an unintended pocket (usually by simple random chance) do not count; that is, unlike in nine-ball, the ball to be pocketed and the pocket must be specified. If a player pockets only the wrong ball, or pockets the nominated ball in the wrong pocket, the ball stays down. The opponent then has the choice of taking the shot, or handing it back. The exception is the 10 ball, which gets respotted on the . This format is considered controversial among some of the game's elite, as many pros are experts at playing multi-way shots where they may be attempting to pocket more than one ball on a given shot.

He successfully defended many people accused of notorious murders and became known as \\"The Great Defender\\". Marshall Hall practised as a barrister in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, when the public took a great interest in the sensational court cases of the day. Big criminal and civil trials were widely reported on by the popular press on a daily basis. As a consequence, he and other successful barristers of the day became very famous. The widespread belief that he was a much better orator than lawyer may explain his failure to achieve elevation to the High Court, which was a source of great disappointment to him. Personal life Born in Brighton, the son of the eminent physician Alfred Hall, Marshall Hall was educated at Rugby School and St John's College, Cambridge. Unusually, he left Cambridge after his fourth term to embark on what would now be regarded as a gap year in Paris and Australia, before returning to complete his law degree. In 1882 he married Ethel Moon. The marriage was unhappy; the couple were never compatible and were frequently separated. They were legally separated in 1889. The next year Ethel became pregnant by a lover and died of a botched abortion; a seamy, very public lawsuit followed in which the lover, the abortionist, and several others were indicted for Ethel's murder. Marshall Hall's guilt over his part in Ethel's fate would have a profound effect on his career: he would become famous for the impassioned nature of his defences of women maltreated by men. He subsequently married Henriette \\"Hetty\\" Kroeger, with whom he had one daughter, Elna. Camden Town Murder Robed, c. 1900 In November 1907 Marshall Hall was briefed in a case which contributed significantly towards his being painted with such titles as \\"The Great Defender\\". On 12 September 1907, Bertram Shaw returned home during the evening to find his room locked. He borrowed a key from a neighbour, but upon entering was greeted with the horrific sight of his fianc√©e Emily Dimmock (known as Phyllis) lying naked on the bed, throat cut from ear to ear. It was a savage but skilful attack on her from the nature of the wound. Nothing much had been taken from the flat, and the motive was a mystery; the case quickly became a sensation. After initial difficulty the police investigation led by Inspector Neill centred on a Robert Wood. Wood was in a relationship with Ruby Young, who recognised his handwriting on a postcard found in Dimmock's room. Wood was put on trial for the murder, during which Marshall Hall displayed the kind of effective and dramatic cross examination that he was known for. Marshall Hall was convinced of Wood's innocence, and also of the fallibility of the prosecution case. Great progress was made with the prosecution witnesses, but real consideration was given to the issue of whether Wood should give evidence in his defence by Marshall Hall and his junior Wellesley Orr. The relevance of their dissension over his testifying soon became apparent as Wood was a bad witness. Marshall Hall dramatically commenced his examination in chief with: \\"Robert Wood, did you kill Emily Dimmock?\\" Wood remained silent. He was said to be a vain young man who could not cast aside his affectations; he appeared a \\"poseur\\". Marshall Hall repeated the question; \\"You must answer straight,\\" he said. Foolishly Wood answered, \\"I mean, it is ridiculous,\\" leaving Marshall Hall distressed. The rest of Wood's evidence proceeded in this way. He was later cross-examined by the might of the senior Treasury Counsel, Sir Charles Mathews, a mismatch if ever there was one. But in the end, Wood's silly little boy foolishness perhaps played in his favour; could he really have murdered Emily Dimmock? Marshall Hall addressed the jury in usual style, as did Sir Charles Mathews. Mr Justice Grantham, however, mid-summing up departed from the pro-conviction stance he was expected to take, making it clear he thought the jury should acquit. That they did, after retiring for only 15 minutes between 7.45 and 8pm. Marshall Hall's spirited defence had persuaded almost all in court of Wood's innocence and had caused a huge crowd to gather outside of court. The huge cheer that went up in the courtroom was repeated outside. Marshall Hall had saved Wood from the gallows. Green bicycle case One of his most famous cases was R v Light, known as the Green Bicycle Case, which took place near Leicester in 1919. He obtained an acquittal, despite what seemed like overwhelming circumstantial evidence against the defendant. This evidence included: the fact that the defendant, Ronald Light, had been seen cycling with the victim, Bella Wright, on the day of her death, on a green bicycle; had possessed at one time a revolver similar to the one used to fire the shot that killed her; had discarded that green bicycle in the canal after filing off all of the identifying numbers; and had thrown away a holster and ammunition for the type of revolver used in the murder. He also lied to police. A full transcript of the evidence and submissions of counsel do not appear to have survived, but from what remains of the closing speech of Marshall Hall, he took advantage of the Crown's lack of a case-theory to take their case to its logical conclusion and then demolish it. He submitted that the prosecution case only held together if the entire murder was premeditated. It was the prosecution evidence, indeed the hearsay evidence of the dead victim, that Ronald Light was not known to Bella Wright. How could he then have planned her murder? Marshall Hall used this, and many other points to persuade the jury that they could not be sure that Light was the murderer. The jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty after a little over three hours. Other cases In 1894 he defended the Austrian-born prostitute Marie Hermann, charged with the murder of a client; Marshall Hall persuaded the jury that it was a case of manslaughter. Although he made full use of his forensic skills, the case is best remembered for his emotional plea to the jury: \\"Look at her, gentlemen... God never gave her a chance - won't you?\\" In 1901 he unsuccessfully defended Herbert John Bennett in the Yarmouth Beach case. Bennett was charged with strangling his wife, Mary, in order to marry Alice Meadows. At a late stage in the trial Marshall Hall dramatically produced an alibi witness, Sholto Douglas, who testified that on the day of the murder he had met Bennett in Bexley, after the last train for Yarmouth had departed. Douglas was clearly a truthful witness but he had never met Bennett before the date of the murder and the prosecution easily convinced the jury that he had made an honest mistake (which was also Marshall Hall's private opinion). The defence was weakened by the absence of any other suspect or motive, and by the fact that Bennett was such an obvious liar that he could not safely be put into the witness box. Curiously enough Marshall Hall, despite the overwhelming evidence, was never entirely sure of Bennett's guilt.Marjoribanks (1989) pp. 119‚Äì149 Marshall Hall was also given the brief to represent Dr Crippen at his trial in 1910. However, Crippen provided instructions that Marshall Hall did not feel comfortable with; Crippen would not adopt the line of defence that Marshall Hall felt represented the truth of the matter. As a result, Marshall Hall returned the brief and other counsel appeared at Crippen's trial at the Old Bailey. Arthur Newton instructed Marshall Hall on this occasion as he often did. Marshall Hall defended Frederick Seddon unsuccessfully in a notorious poisoning case in 1912. Seddon was hanged in 1912 for murdering Elizabeth Mary Barrow by administering large quantities of arsenic. Marshall Hall's challenge to the medical evidence, though showing an impressive grasp of the subject, was unsuccessful. Seddon, rather against counsel's wishes, insisted on giving evidence, and made a very bad impression. His manner struck observers as cold and unfeeling, and his obvious greed weakened the defence that the money he gained from Miss Barrow's death was not enough to tempt him to murder. Marshall Hall in later years said that Seddon would have been acquitted if he had not insisted on giving evidence. Marshall Hall also defended George Joseph Smith the \\"Brides-in-the-Bath\\" murderer in 1915. Smith was tried for the first of three identical murders of his recent brides, all of whom were drowned while having baths. Despite a spirited defence by Marshall Hall, Smith was convicted and hanged, again largely due to key evidence from Sir Bernard Spilsbury. The case however does seem to contradict the widespread view that he was \\"not much of a lawyer\\"‚Äîrather he disliked legal argument but could make a good one if necessary.Marjoribanks (1989) p. 285 Marshall Hall successfully defended solicitor Harold Greenwood at Carmarthen Assizes in 1920. Greenwood had been accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic. Marshall Hall's skillful cross-examination of the medical witnesses raised, at least, the possibility that Mrs. Greenwood had died from an accidental overdose of morphine. His closing speech for the defence was described by Gerald Sparrow as \\"the finest ever heard at the English bar\\",Marjoribanks (1989) 342-353Andrew Mitchell, Minel Dadhania, S level law, Routledge Cavendish, 2003, , p. 188 the more impressive since Marshall Hall was seriously ill at the time. Equally successful was the defence Marshall Hall gave to Madame (or Princess) Marguerite Fahmy in 1923 for the shooting death of her husband, Egyptian Prince Fahmy Bey at London's Savoy Hotel. The death of the Prince is frequently on lists of victims of the so-called Curse of the Pharaohs.Tutankhamen's Curse: The Developing History of an Egyptian King p. 233 Marshall Hall brought out Prince Fahmy's race and sexual habits, painting the victim as an evil-minded foreigner who threatened a \\"white woman\\" for sexual reasons, whereupon she defended herself. The jury accepted it. The Egyptian ambassador wrote several angry letters to the newspapers criticizing Marshall Hall's blackening of the victim and Egyptians in general. In any case Madame Fahmy was acquitted.Marjoribanks (1989) 363-380 In his 2013 book The Prince, The Princess and the Perfect Murder (published in the US as \\"The Woman Before Wallis\\") Andrew Rose revealed that Madame Fahmy, real name Marguerite Alibert, a Frenchwoman of modest birth, had an 18-month long affair with the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, in Paris towards the end of World War I. Desperate efforts were made by the Royal Household to ensure that the Prince's name was not mentioned at her trial, which may have contributed to her acquittal.http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/389389/A-new-book- brings-to-light-the-scandalous-story-of-Edward-VIII-s-first-great-loveAndrew Rose op cit, passim.

Rupert Godfrey (ed) \\"Letters from a Prince\\", Warner Books 1999 pp138,143,299 In July 1924, Marshall Hall made a rare appearance for the prosecution, with the Attorney General Sir Patrick Hastings leading at Guildford Assizes before Mr Justice Avory against Jean-Pierre Vaquier for poisoning his lover's husband.Marjoribanks (1989) p. 380 Vaquier was found guilty and hanged by Robert Baxter. Political career As well as being elevated to King's Counsel, Marshall Hall served twice in Parliament as a Unionist Member of Parliament for Southport (1900‚Äì1906) and for Liverpool East Toxteth (1910-1916). To the great disappointment of the public, he rarely spoke in the House of Commons, and such speeches as he did make did not compare with his courtroom oratory. Legacy Edward Marshall Hall was born and lived at 30 Old Steine, Brighton where there is a commemorative stone plaque on the wall. The building today houses one of Brighton's oldest established firms of solicitors, Burt Brill and Cardens, and remains largely unchanged externally and internally. Brighton & Hove have named a bus after him.Brighton and Hove Bus and Coach Travel Times Routes and Timetables at www.buses.co.uk The County Borough of Southport named Hall Street after him in his honour. In his day, Marshall Hall made and lost many a fortune and was alternately impecunious or well in funds. When he died, he was in funds and left a considerable sum of money in a trust to be administered by Inner Temple for the benefit of young barristers starting out on their careers and who were as impecunious as he had been from time to time. The fund continues to this day. Marshall Hall's career was dramatised in an 8-episode 1989 BBC Two television serial by Richard Cooper, Shadow of the Noose, starring Jonathan Hyde in the lead role and Terry Taplin as Arthur Newton, the leading solicitor who often secured Marshall Hall's services. John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole of the Bailey, presented some of Marshall Hall's cases in a 5-part 1996 radio series, starring Tom Baker as Marshall Hall.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b063m8h9 Hall was a famous wit and, in the case of an Irish labourer, when asked by a rather pompous judge, \\"Is your client not familiar with the maxim res ipsa loquitur?‚Äù replied, \\"My lord, on the remote hillside in County Donegal where my client hails from, they talk of little else.\\" References Sources * Edward Marjoribanks, The Life of Sir Edward Marshall Hall, Victor Gollancz Ltd, London 1929. * Edward Marjoribanks, Famous Trials of Marshall Hall, Penguin, 1989. * Nina Warner Hooke & Gil Thomas, Marshall Hall, Arthur Barker, London 1966. * Sally Smith, Marshall Hall: A Law Unto Himself, Wildy Simmons & Hill Publishing, London 2016. .

[2002] EWCA Civ 1702 was a patent case regarding Internet usage. The case addressed a European patent covering the United Kingdom for an invention referred to as \\"Interactive, computerized gaming system with remote control\\". Menashe sued William Hill, claiming that William Hill was infringing the patent by operating an online gaming system. William Hill's defence argued that it did not infringe the patent because the server on which it operated the system was located outside of the UK, in Antigua or Cura√ßao. Although accepting that their supply of software was in the UK and that this was an essential part of the invention, they further argued that the patent was for the parts of the system, and as one essential part of the system was not located in the UK, there could be no infringement. This aspect of William Hill's case was tried at a preliminary issue before Mr. Justice Jacob in the High Court in 2002. Mr. Justice Jacob found against William Hill holding that the patent related to the entire system, being the sum of all its elements. Simply locating one part of the system abroad did not prevent infringement when the result was still providing UK punters with the system's benefits. The Court's ruling took a broad interpretation, concentrating on the spirit and intention of patent protection and not confining itself to the linguistic construction of the law which developed before the advent of the Internet. Lord Justice Aldous heard the appeal and while he maintained the result of the judgment of the Patents Court, the reasoning was very different and was based upon where the invention was being \\"used\\". The claimed invention required there to be a host or server computer. According to the judgment, it did not matter where the host computer was situated. It could be in the United Kingdom, on a satellite, or even on the border between two countries. Its location was not important to the user of the invention nor to the claimed gaming system. In that respect, there was a real difference between the claimed gaming system and an ordinary machine. The judge therefore believed that it would be wrong to apply the old ideas of location to inventions of the type under consideration. A person who is situated in the United Kingdom who obtains in the United Kingdom a CD and then uses his terminal to address a host computer is not bothered where the host computer is located. It is of no relevance to him, the user, nor the patentee as to whether or not it is situated in the United Kingdom. If the host computer is situated in Antigua and the terminal computer is in the United Kingdom, it is pertinent to ask who uses the claimed gaming system. The answer must be the punter. Where does he use it? There can be no doubt that he uses his terminal in the United Kingdom and it is not a misuse of language to say that he uses the host computer in the United Kingdom. It is the input to and output of the host computer that is important to the punter and in a real sense the punter uses the host computer in the United Kingdom even though it is situated in Antigua and operates in Antigua. In those circumstances it is not straining the word \\"use\\" to conclude that the United Kingdom punter will use the claimed gaming system in the United Kingdom, even if the host computer is situated in, say, Antigua. Thus the supply of the CD in the United Kingdom to the United Kingdom punter will be intended to put the invention into effect in the United Kingdom.

Greenlining is the solution to redlining. They advance economic opportunity and empowerment for people of color through advocacy, community and coalition building, research, and leadership development.  History  The Greenlining Institute was established by African American, Asian American, and Latino American community leaders in 1993 to fight injustice, increase the participation of people of color in policymaking, and encourage successful investment by corporate America into these communities. Rather than just fighting redlining, the illegal practice of denying services to certain communities, greenlining is the proactive effort of bringing profitable investments and services to communities that have been left behind. The Greenlining Institute was founded on the principle of wealth creation, with a strong belief that diversity makes business sense and leads to greater effectiveness.  Policy Issues  =Philanthropy-related activities= In 2005, Greenlining began researching the philanthropic giving patterns of California's largest foundations and found very low investment in non-profit organizations led by people of color. According to the US Census, California's communities of color comprise over 50% of the state's population‚Äîmaking it a majority-minority state.https://www.census.gov/Press- Release/www/releases/archives/population/005514.html Greenlining found that philanthropic giving did not reflect California's population. Greenlining's introduced AB 624, which was a piece of ‚Äúsunshine‚Äù legislation that would have require large foundations operating in California to gather and disclose pertinent diversity data. AB 624 would not have required foundations to invest in minority communities, and it would not have created racial quotas for grant-making and employment. This legislation was an attempt to get foundations to disclose data related to diversity on an annual basis. The bill was ultimately withdrawn. =Opposition to Uber= The Greenlining Institute opposed the expansion of Uber into Oakland, California due to concerns that it would cause displacement of residents and gentrification. =Community reinvestment= Greenlining's Community Reinvestment program works with banks and other financial institutions to equitably execute the Community Reinvestment Act.

Applications include photographs with poor contrast due to glare, for example. Normalization is sometimes called contrast stretching or histogram stretching. In more general fields of data processing, such as digital signal processing, it is referred to as dynamic range expansion. The purpose of dynamic range expansion in the various applications is usually to bring the image, or other type of signal, into a range that is more familiar or normal to the senses, hence the term normalization. Often, the motivation is to achieve consistency in dynamic range for a set of data, signals, or images to avoid mental distraction or fatigue. For example, a newspaper will strive to make all of the images in an issue share a similar range of grayscale. Normalization transforms an n-dimensional grayscale image I:\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbb{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{Min},..,\\\\text{Max}\\\\\\\\} with intensity values in the range (Min,Max), into a new image I_N:\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbb{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{newMin},..,\\\\text{newMax}\\\\\\\\} with intensity values in the range (newMin,newMax). The linear normalization of a grayscale digital image is performed according to the formula :I_N=(I-\\\\text{Min})\\\\frac{\\\\text{newMax}-\\\\text{newMin}}{\\\\text{Max}-\\\\text{Min}}+\\\\text{newMin} For example, if the intensity range of the image is 50 to 180 and the desired range is 0 to 255 the process entails subtracting 50 from each of pixel intensity, making the range 0 to 130. Then each pixel intensity is multiplied by 255/130, making the range 0 to 255. Normalization might also be non linear, this happens when there isn't a linear relationship between I and I_N. An example of non-linear normalization is when the normalization follows a sigmoid function, in that case, the normalized image is computed according to the formula :I_N=(\\\\text{newMax}-\\\\text{newMin})\\\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\\\frac{I-\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}}}+\\\\text{newMin} Where \\\\alpha defines the width of the input intensity range, and \\\\beta defines the intensity around which the range is centered.ITK Software Guide Auto- normalization in image processing software typically normalizes to the full dynamic range of the number system specified in the image file format.

At the time he was still a minor. Seven years later, his stepfather, the Emperor Conrad II, married him to Adelaide of Susa, the marchioness of Turin, in January 1037. Herman was then invested as margrave of Turin.Hellmann, Grafen, p. 13 In July of the next year, while campaigning with Conrad in Southern Italy, he was struck down by an epidemic near Naples.

Early life Carol Lambrino was born in Bucharest as son of Crown Prince Carol of Romania and his first wife, Zizi Lambrino. At the time of his birth he was registered with the name Mircea Grigore Carol Lambrino. He was named by his father after his youngest brother Prince Mircea of Romania who died in 1916. His grandfather King Ferdinand forced the annulment of his parents' marriage in January 1919 in the Supreme Court of Romania and Carol was born outside the 300-day period allowed to permit legitimacy, on 8 January 1920. The legality of the annulment has been questioned.Prince Paul of Romania, Genealogy page 3 After his birth, Carol and his mother were forced to leave Romania and settled in Paris. During his younger years and his reign, including during his personal dictatorship (1938‚Äì1940) when he held absolute power in Romania, King Carol II recognized his first-born Mircea Carol as a prince on several occasions. One of these situations was a letter published on the front page by the Romanian daily newspaper Epoca (17 January 1920). Signed by Crown Prince Carol, the document is a statement in which the future king recognized his paternity of Princess Ioana's baby. \\"Epoca front page article - Letter of HRH Crown Prince Carol of Romania to his wife, Princess Ioana\\", Epoca daily newspaper, 17 January 1920 Furthermore, (or the German style family name Prinz von Hohenzollern) . Legitimisation After the death of his father, former King Carol II, in Portugal, 4 April 1953, Carol claimed the right to inherit some of his father's estate in accordance with Portuguese law. In order to do so, it was necessary to prove that he was his father's legitimate son. On April 2, 1955, a Portuguese court ruled that Carol was the legitimate first-born son of King Carol II and allowed him to claim the surname Hohenzollern in place of Lambrino. On 6 March 1957, the Portuguese ruling was recognised in France by an Exequatur of the Tribunal of the Grande Instance of Paris. This allowed Carol rights of inheritance to his father's French properties. Carol's younger half-brother Michael appealed this ruling which was upheld by the Court of Cassation, 8 January 1963. In October 1995 a Romanian court ruled that Carol was the legitimate son of King Carol II.'Bastard' Romanian prince goes legitimate His half-brother, Michael, appealed this ruling, but lost the case in an upper court of appeal in 1999. In March 2002, the Supreme Court of Romania ruled that there should be a retrial, and in July 2002 a lower court ruled again in Carol's favour. Michael again appealed, and in January 2003 he again lost the appeal.Prince Paul of Romania, Genealogy page 8 Michael again appealed in December 2003. Carol visited Bucharest in November 2005. That was the first time he went to Romania after he had attended the funeral of his grandmother Queen Marie in 1938. Two months later, Carol died in London.

Saddleworth Sketches, 1871. Like many of the Saddleworth villages, it traces its history back to a collection of hamlets. Transport A railway line that connects Manchester to Huddersfield and Leeds runs through Diggle. There used to be a local railway station in the village, which opened in 1849, but it was one of many to go in the Beeching era, closing in 1963. The nearest stations to Diggle are in Greenfield and Marsden in Yorkshire. The hourly daytime bus service runs to Huddersfield, Oldham and Manchester.

Ungma is one of the most ancient Ao villages and of great tourist interest to view the folklore, customs and traditions of Ao Nagas. Legends indicate the early Aos settled here first after coming from Chungliyimti before migrating to the rest of Ao areas. An old log drum in the village is worth visiting. There is also a beautiful Park on the outskirts of the village. Ungma celebrates most of the traditional festivals Moats√º, Tsungremong, etc with much pomp and splendour. The village is divided into two parts, Yimpang (North) and Yimlang (South). In the heart of the village, i.e., between Yimpang and Yimlang, the Baptist Church stands, reflecting the dominance of Baptist faith in the everyday life of the village.  Demography  In recent years, both Mokokchung and Ungma have grown due to increase in population and have become one continuous settlement. It is a part of the continuous settlements from Amenyong and Khensa in the Northwest and DEF colony in the Northeast through Mokokchung and Ungma up to Alichen in the south. This has resulted in an urban agglomeration that is the third largest in the state. With a population of 7,189 people (2001 census), Ungma is the third largest Ao village as also the third largest village in Mokokchung district. Prior to this, Ungma enjoyed the privilege of being the largest Ao village as also that of Mokokchung District. However, by 2001 census, Chuchuyimlang and Changki had overtaken Ungma in terms of population. Recent population trend also suggest that Longjang may soon overtake Ungma as the third largest Ao village.  People, culture, festivals The people are friendly and courteous. Almost the entire population is Christian. Christmas and New Year is a very good time to visit Ungma. The villagers begin to celebrate Christmas from the first week of December and continue until the new year.  Politics  Ungma falls under 26 Aonglenden Assembly Constituency of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly. The ex-Chief Minister of Nagaland (the longest serving chief minister in Nagaland history), the ex-Governor of Goa and Maharashtra, S. C. Jamir, hails from this village. It is partly because of his towering personality that Ungma in particular and Mokokchung district in general has virtually become a bastion of the Indian National Congress Party.  Attractions  Nature Park Ungma is a beautiful park located in the outskirt of the Village. It was built upon a hilltop, a place also known as Tzudir Yimka. The National Highway 61 (India) is adjacent with the park. Visitors comes here for entertainment varying from family picnics to weddings, seminars and educational tours. It is well maintained and remains open all through the week.

He was an art connoisseur who formed a famous collection of antiquities, housed at the Villa Ludovisi in Rome.  Biography Ludovico Ludovisi was born in Bologna, then part of the Papal States, the son of Orazio Ludovisi and Lavinia Albergati. Following in the footsteps of his uncle Alessandro Ludovisi, he was trained at the Jesuit Collegio Germanico of Rome, and went on to the University of Bologna, where he received his doctorate in canon law on 25 February 1615. Pope Gregory XV with his Cardinal-Nephew of unprecedented income and authority, Ludovico Ludovisi, known as il cardinale padrone (the Cardinal Boss). Pope Gregory XV and his nephew Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi. When Alessandro Ludovisi was acclaimed pope, taking the name Gregory XV, Ludovico was made cardinal the day after his coronation, though he was only 25. The following month he was made archbishop of Bologna though he remained in Rome. His uncle had great faith in his judgement and energy and was in need of a strong and able assistant to help govern the Papal States (the Pope was, after all, in his late 60s). On the same day, Orazio Ludovisi, Ludovico's father, was put at the head of the pontifical army. Gregory XV was not disappointed in his nephew. As the Catholic Encyclopedia avers:Catholic Encyclopedia article. He was sent as legate in Fermo in 1621 and in Avignon, 1621‚Äì1623. He served briefly as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (19 April 1621 to 7 June 1623). In August 1623, Ludovisi participated in the papal conclave that elected Pope Urban VIII. Due to conflict with the new pope's family, Ludovisi was forced to leave Rome. History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (Wellesley College Library, reprint; 2009) He continued, however, as prefect of the sacred consulta of the Propaganda Fide (1622 to 1632) and Vice- Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church (1623 to 1632). He died in Bologna in 1632. Patron of the arts Cardinal Ludovisi is remembered as a connoisseur and patron of arts. He paid for the construction of the Jesuit Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio and Palazzo Ludovisi (now Palazzo Montecitorio), where Gian Lorenzo Bernini was his architect. He rapidly assembled from private owners and the Carmelite brothers of Santa Maria in Traspontina a holding of vineyards and small plots to create the Villa Ludovisi, a vast complex of gardens and buildings on the Monte Pincio near Porta Pinciana, in the so- called \\"Gardens of Sallust\\" on the site where Julius Caesar and his heir, Augustus, had had their villas.Associazione Culturale \\"Salvaguardia della Romanit√†\\": Rione XVI Ludovisi The Ludovisi Ares, a spectacular discovery of 1622, found its way quickly to the collection. He employed Alessandro Algardi to restore other finds, some of which were unearthed in the grounds of the Villa itself. The sculpture was lightly restored by Bernini and joined the Dying Gaul in the Cardinal's gallery. The Ludovisi collection was enlarged with purchases from Cardinal Altemps' collection, all housed at the splendid Villa Ludovisi, which he surrounded with gardens. Guercino painted frescoes at the villa, and Cardinal Ludovisi's house poet was Alessandro Tassoni. At the casino of the Villa, Cardinal Ludovisi employed Carlo Maderno to rebuild a simple house further up the hill.

Effects, such as a minimization animation or a cube workspace, are implemented as loadable plugins. Because it conforms to the ICCCM standard, Compiz can be used as a substitute for the default Mutter or Metacity, when using GNOME Panel, or KWin in KDE Plasma Workspaces. Internally Compiz uses the OpenGL library as the interface to the graphics hardware. Hardware requirements Initially, Compiz only worked with 3D hardware supported by Xgl. Most NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards are known to work with Compiz on Xgl. Since May 22, 2006 Compiz works on the standard X.Org Server, by using AIGLX. Besides Intel GMA graphics cards, AIGLX also supports using AMD graphics cards (including R300 and newer cards) using the open-source driver which supports since fall 2006. NVIDIA's binary drivers (since Version 1.0-9629) support on standard X.Org server; ATI/AMD's binary drivers do since version 8.42. History The first version of Compiz was released as free software by Novell (SUSE) in January 2006 in the wake of the (also new) Xgl. It was one of the earliest compositing window managers for X. In March 2006 Compiz was ported to AIGLX by Red Hat. =Beryl= Beryl was the project name for the quinnstorm branch of Compiz, announced on September 19, 2006 after Compiz developer Quinn Storm and the development team decided that the fork had come too far from the original Compiz started by Novell (). After the Novell XGL/Compiz team (mostly David Reveman) refused the proposition to merge the Quinnstorm changes with compiz-vanilla, the decision was made to make a real differentiation. Among the differences to Compiz, Beryl had a new window decorator named Emerald based on cgwd along with a theme manager called , used a flat file backend instead of gconf, and had no GNOME dependencies. =Merger of the Compiz and Beryl communities= On March 30, 2007, discussions between the Beryl and Compiz communities led to a merger of the two communities which results in two new software packages: * Compiz, (also Compiz-core) which contains only the core functionality of Compiz and base plugins * Compiz Fusion, consisting of the plugins, decorators, settings tools and related applications from the Beryl and Compiz communities. Compiz Fusion concentrates on installation, configuration and additional plugins to add to the core functionalities of Compiz. Outcomes include plans to fund a code review panel consisting of the best developers from each community who will see that any code included in a release package meets the highest standards and is suitable for distribution in an officially supported package. =Further branches= In the fourth quarter of 2008, two separate branches of Compiz were created: compiz++ and NOMAD; compiz++ was geared toward the separation of compositing and OpenGL layers for the rendering of the window manager without compositing effects, and the port from C to C++ programming language. NOMAD was geared towards the improvement of remote desktop performance for Compiz installations. =Merger of the Compiz branches= On February 2, 2009 a conference call was held between developers of Compiz, Compiz++, NOMAD and Compiz Fusion where it was decided to merge the projects into a unified project, simply named Compiz, with a unified roadmap. =Compiz 0.9 series= On July 4, 2010, Sam Spilsbury, lead Compiz developer, announced the release of Compiz 0.9.0 with a new API, rewritten in C++. Canonical Ltd. hired Spilsbury to further develop Compiz for Ubuntu in October 2010. Since then Compiz development mostly coincides with Ubuntudevelopment. Main development moved to Canonical's Launchpad service. The 0.9.x versions up to 0.9.5 were seen as unstable/beta software. With version 0.9.6 in progress, Canonical hired developer Daniel van Vugt to work on Compiz full-time. While 0.9.6 never officially released, Compiz 0.9.7.0 was released a month ahead of enterprise- targeted Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Term Support) and declared stable. A few days before the official release of Ubuntu 12.04 a new development branch, 0.9.8, was created in preparation for Ubuntu 12.10. For Compiz version 0.9.8 development has moved to a new Launchpad page. In November 2012, Spilsbury announced that he had left Canonical and stated he had no plans to port Compiz to Wayland. A small team continues to work on Compiz with version 0.9.13 being the focus of development as of July 2016. =Compiz Reloaded= A group forked the Compiz 0.8 series code base and modernized it and maintains it as of 2019. Features Shift Switcher plugin Almost all available Compiz features ‚Äì except translucency, dimming, and desaturation ‚Äì are delivered using plugins. Compiz plugins include the cube effect, Alt-Tab application-switching with live previews or icons, and a feature similar to macOS's Mission Control. The Composite extension to X is used, as is the OpenGL extension . The Compiz project categorizes the plugins into four main groups: Main, Extra, Unsupported, and Experimental. Window managers use a program called a window decorator to provide the window borders with the usual minimize, maximize and close buttons. Unlike many window managers which have only one window decorator, Compiz users have a choice of three: * gtk-window-decorator uses either a basic cairo-based rendering engine or can use Metacity themes.Emerald themer 0.9.5 with trueglass 0.5 frame engine * kde-window-decorator uses native KWin themes. * Emerald, a custom decorator with its own theme format that has been ported to Compiz. It used to be Beryl's default decorator. Deployments Compiz or Beryl have usually been deployed on Linux and other X11-based Unix-like platforms together with GNOME 2 and KDE 3. Since version 4.2, however, KDE's own KWin ships with capabilities similar to Compiz. As such, Compiz is not usually deployed with recent Plasma Workspaces versions. GNOME version 3.0 uses GNOME Shell which is built as a plugin to the Mutter compositing window manager. This means Compiz cannot be used in conjunction with GNOME Shell. Citing a lack of maintenance on the part of the Compiz developers, Fedora removed Compiz from the Fedora repositories from Fedora 17 however Compiz has been reinstated in the Fedora repositories since Fedora 18. An official MATE spin which includes Compiz has been available since Fedora 19. Compiz was dropped from the Debian repositories from Debian 7 (Wheezy) onwards in August 2013 due to broken packages and a lack of upstream development on the part of the Compiz developers. Compiz was reintroduced into Debian in December 2016 by the Hypra.fr Team. Compiz was dropped from the Arch Linux repositories in May 2013. Compiz can still be installed from packages available in the Arch User Repository. Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and later included Compiz in the universe repository. A limited version was included by default as \\"Desktop Effects\\" in Ubuntu 7.04. From Ubuntu 7.10 onwards, Compiz was enabled by default. In 2010 Canonical released their Unity interface which is written as a plugin for Compiz.

The name Sabatier is considered to imply a high-quality knife produced by one of a number of manufacturers in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process; the knives of some of these manufacturers are highly regarded. However, the name \\"Sabatier\\" came into use before intellectual property laws and is not protected; knives legally bearing the name range from high-quality knives made in France to cheap mass-produced products of poor quality from France and other countries; a registered logo or full name, or both, such as \\"65 Sabatier Perrier\\", is necessary to establish origin and quality. History The name originated in Thiers, France at the beginning of the 19th century. The area of Thiers has been associated with the cutlery industry since the Middle Ages. With the advent of the industrial age manufacturers began to consolidate their crafts or trades by creating brand or trade marks. In the early 19th century, two separate families began using the name Sabatier to market their knives: Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Philippe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers). The families are not known to be related except by name and craft. There is a dispute over who registered the trademark first, with each citing evidence. The Sabatiers of Le Moutier company survived in many incarnations until the brand was bought out by Cuisinox in 1979. The only surviving family is the Sabatiers of Bellevue, which is still at the same address and still owned by the descendants of the original founder, Philippe Sabatier. It continues to make the knives under the corporate name ETS Sabatier A√Æn√© & Perrier. Manufacturing process Among the many Sabatier manufacturers in Thiers, France, most provide high quality cutlery using traditional forging techniques that were developed in the area in the early and mid-19th century. Most of these manufacturers use a \\"fully forged\\" technique and a hand shaping and sharpening process using local skilled labour. Fully forged means that three of the four knife parts (blade, bolster, tang and handle) are forged from a single piece of steel. In this process, a single cylinder shaped steel billet is heated where the bolster will be, and squeezed from the ends to create a bulge. The entire piece is heated again and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, and tang using forging dies in one operation. Afterward, a clipping tool is used to cut the forged piece to the rough shape of the knife. Finally, the handles are riveted on, and the final shaping and sharpening is done by hand. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping. Brand names The use of the Sabatier name is an anomaly of \\"branding\\" because the name was used by many different companies before intellectual property or trademark laws were fully established in France. In order to distinguish between the various makers of Sabatier knives, manufacturers are required to include a second word or symbol along with \\"Sabatier\\". Over the years many marks have been registered. In 1979, after the sale of the Moutier Sabatier brands to Cuisinox, the various holders of the brands formed an association to protect the brand name. * SABATIER fr√®res * K SABATIER * SABATIER PERRIER * 65 SABATIER * 62 SABATIER * France SABATIER Jeune K Garanti * SABATIER Jeune Garanti with a bunch of grapes * SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti with a bunch of grapes * France SABATIER Acier Fondu couronne K Garanti * V√©ritable SABATIER France * Professional SABATIER * SABATIER Professional * V SABATIER France * V SABATIER Acier Fondu Garanti * V SABATIER Extra Fin * SABATIER 689 Couronn√© * SABATIER Couronn√© * SABATIER 589 Couronn√© * SABATIER Trompette * SABATIER Deg * SABATIER*** SabatieR * SABATIER Trumpet France * Sarry SABATIER * Le vrai SABATIER * Le seul SABATIER * L‚Äôunique SABATIER 1√®re qualit√© * SABATIER with a stylised slicing disk * SABATIER Lion * SABATIER Diamant * SABATIER Elephant While there are many knife manufacturers using Sabatier as their brand, some Sabatier manufacturers are considered authentic, and some are not. Generally speaking, among connoisseurs of fine cutlery, only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered \\"genuine\\" Sabatier knives. Many other manufacturers, both in France and elsewhere, use the Sabatier name on their knives; however, they are usually mass-produced, and of poor quality. Neither words such as vrai or garanti, nor \\"Made in France\\", ensure a good knife. Companies selling Sabatier knives Sabatier brands have been sold by many companies over the years. The following list is an attempt to link the present day owners to the brands. * ETS Sabatier A√Æn√© & Perrier - Sabatier A√Æn√© & Perrier claims to be the oldest Sabatier knife maker still in existence and operated by the descendants of Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue, Thiers, France. The brand has been based in Thiers, the French cutlery trade capital, since the early 19th century. They have operated for more than 200 years and have sold under the brand name Sabatier-k since 1834, to distinguish themselves from the Sabatier of Le Moutier. The first references to the mark \\"K\\" can be found in the town archives, engraved on the Silver Tablet of Cutlers, dated 7 June 1813 under number 231. Eight generations of the Sabatier family of Bellevue have been involved in the business. * Thiers Issard Sabatier - Thiers Issard Sabatier have manufactured the Sabatier Elephant knives in Thiers since 1958. * Therias et L'Econome - Therias et L'Econome claim to have been manufacturing knives in Thiers since 1819.

Administratively, the village is located in the Pensby & Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. At the 2001 Census, Barnston had a population of 3,620 (1,700 males, 1,920 females) At the 2011 Census, the population was 947 (501 males, 441 females). History Barnston is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Bernestone and comprised two mills, a manor house and a hospital. Formerly a township in Woodchurch Parish, Wirral Hundred. Barnston's population was 129 in 1801, 239 in 1851, 522 in 1901 and 832 in 1951. On 24 March 1962, The Beatles performed at the Barnston Women's Institute. It is noted that this was the first time that Brian Epstein put The Beatles into suits for their performances. John Lennon regarded this as the first, and perhaps the ultimate, sellout of their career. The Beatles played here again on Saturday 30 June and Tuesday 25 September 1962. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including Barnston, being transferred from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside.

It was published as two separate but intertwined two-issue mini-series, each focusing on different members of the same team and showing events from their different perspectives. Team One: WildC.A.T.s focused on members who were involved with the WildC.A.T.s series, while Team One: Stormwatch focused on members who were involved with the Stormwatch series. History Team One was formed in the 1960s through the secret efforts of Lord Emp, then called Saul Baxter. For nearly 50 years, Daemonite activity had been non-existent, but a sudden flurry of attacks aimed at U.S. military bases worried Baxter that a new offensive was coming. Using his influence within the military-industrial complex, he arranged for the formation of a team to handle the oncoming threat. Enter Miles Craven. As head of the newly formed International Operations, he was chosen to act as the visible head of the team; Baxter's true level of involvement was to remain a secret. Through a combination of Baxter's influence and contacts among the Kherubim and Craven's involvement with a number of secret military projects, the team was created and dubbed Team One. On their first mission, the group was mobilized to deal with the takeover of a nuclear missile silo by the combined forces of the superpowered crime lord \\"Slaughterhouse\\" Smith and Helspont. The personnel of the silo were all swiftly killed. The duo had intended to hold the country for ransom, threatening to launch the missiles if they weren't paid on time. Trouble arises when Smith realizes that Helspont really intends to destroy New York, which Smith has a weak spot for. Helspont double-crosses him anyway. Team One arrives and battles the enemy. Further trouble ensues when one of the team loses their nerve and freezes up in the midst of battle. While the exact details of the battle's climax aren't known, the outcome is. Regiment died when the missile he was holding onto exploded and John Colt asks Majestic to kill him since he feared that his dark side could emerge. Majestic began his apparent sabbatical at the North Pole, Mason was later killed by the villain Kenyan (an enemy of Saul Baxter/Jacob Marlowe) and Team One was disbanded.

They formed in 2000 with Tim Evans and Ian Wadley as the core and only continuous members of the group. The first self-titled recording was performed with Evans on drums, with Wadley and Evans overdubbing the other instruments. Subsequently, this recording was disowned by the band. Duncan Haigh joined briefly as a live drummer but was eventually replaced by Tom Egg as the band's first permanent drummer. The lineup was filled out by the inclusion of Karl Scullin on bass. With this lineup, the Bird Blobs recorded an unreleased album in 2002, and then released their debut \\"official\\" album Stihl Life in April 2003. The album was recorded by Simon Grounds (Rocket Science, Venom P. Stinger) at Sublime Studios in Melbourne. The rhythm section was subsequently replaced, and the final lineup included Evans, Wadley, bassist Jordan Redaelli and drummer Steve Masterson. With this lineup they recorded the second self-titled full-length album, which was released in September 2004. The album was recorded at Woodstock Studios in Melbourne with US engineer Casey Rice (Tortoise, Liz Phair), and later mixed by Simon Grounds. Both their albums were released through the independent Tasmanian label Unstable Ape. Their second self-titled album was also released on UK independent label, Sounds of Sweet Nothing. The band have toured the United States, the UK and Europe, including playing the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in December 2004.

Coming under Saidapur Mandal, it is situated near the famous temple village Godisaala. During the Kakatiya dynasty, one of the Kakatiya senaani (army chiefs) built the Shiva temple here. This temple came into the light during some archaeological excavations and the people believed that this temple is more famous than the Vemulavaada temple (which now has a famous Shiva temple). Jagirpally is also near to Vangara, which is the hometown of the former Prime Minister of India, P.V. Narasimha Rao.  History  It is believed that some land was given to a person by the rulers, called the Jaageer. It was part of Saidapur Gram Panchayit's ward. Entire village received one ward but no political importance until the early 1990s. After the number of voters reached almost 1,000, the government elected separate Sarpanch elections to the village.  Other Information  Jagirpally has produced some good talent. Children used to walk for 3 km to reach the High School located at Venkapally to continue their studies from 6th to 10th. The majority of the population is dependent on agriculture. There are a few good doctors from this village like Laxmaiah Avula, Indrasena Reddy K and Srinivas K, as well as scientists like Prashanth A and Satyanarayana K and software engineers like Vishnuvardhan K, Srinivas Reddy K, Sridhar K, Srikanth B, Praveen T and Anjaneyulu G, among others. There are also government employees like Sampath P and Ravinder G. There are also people who are working in different areas, like medical, education institutes, finance and other private institutes. Agriculture in this village is 100% based on the rain water, wells and under the lakes. Between 1990 and the early 2000s, there was a severe drought resulting in many people migrating to Hyderabad. Some, however, went to Dubai and worked in very bad conditions. There was no bank until the early 2010s in the village as people were not used to getting loans for crops.

Career In 1890, Hesselink had been part of an attempt to get a cricket club off the ground in Arnhem and two years later he was one of the founders of Vitesse Arnhem. Cricket was the initial activity of choice but football took over quickly and Hesselink was soon the star of the team. Hesselink also excelled in athletics, holding several national records including the long jump. A team made up of him and his brothers became national champions in tug of war. In 1899, he made the move to HVV and won two times the national championship. In 1903, Hesselink moved to Munich to study Philosophy and Chemistry and joined FC Bayern Munich. Hesselink became Bayern's first international star. In three years he would grow out to be their star player, manager and chairman. In January 1906 Hesselink left Munich, leaving a club that had grown considerably in his time at the helm in the hands of Kurt M√ºller, and returned to the Netherlands.

According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, it is ranked 4th in the world by circulation and 1st in India. Started in Bhopal in 1958, it expanded in 1983 with the launch of Dainik Bhaskar's Indore edition. Today, Dainik Bhaskar Group is present in 12 states with 65 editions in Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati.  History  Dainik Bhaskar was launched in 1948 to fulfill the need for a Hindi language daily newspaper. It launched under the name Subah Savere in Bhopal and Good Morning India in Gwalior. In 1957, the paper was renamed Bhaskar Samachar. In 1958, it was renamed Dainik Bhaskar. The word Bhaskar means \\"The Rising Sun\\" in English. Along with its rising sun graphic, was meant to represent a bright future.http://rni.nic.in/registerdtitle_search/  Expansion  By 1995, Dainik Bhaskar had emerged as the number 1 newspaper in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and was declared the fastest-growing daily in India by a readership survey. The newspaper decided to expand outside MP, and identified Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan, as the market with the highest potential. In 1996, Dainik Bhaskar's goal was to enter Jaipur as the No. 2 newspaper (in terms of circulation) on its first day, with 50,000 copies. To achieve this target, an in-house team of 700 surveyors surveyed 200,000 potential newspaper households in Jaipur. Based on survey feedback, they went back to each of the households surveyed to show them a prototype of the newspaper and gave them the option of an advance subscription. The customers were offered a subscription price of ‚Çπ1.50 (a discount compared to the newsstand price of ‚Çπ2), and a refund in case of dissatisfaction. When Dainik Bhaskar launched in Jaipur on 19 December 1996, it was the No. 1 newspaper by selling 172,347 copies. Amar Ujala, is a Hindi-dialect day by day daily paper distributed in India. It has 19 versions in seven states and one union domain covering 167 regions. It has a course of around two million copies. Rajasthan Patrika, the former leader had a circulation of around 100,000 copies at that time. Dainik Bhaskar successfully adopted a similar model in other cities of Rajasthan, including Jodhpur, Bikaner, Kota, Udaipur, and Ajmer Sikar, becoming the No.1 urban newspaper of the entire state by 1999. The next target was Chandigarh. It launched a customer survey in January 2000, covering 220,000 households. At that time, the English language newspapers in Chandigarh outsold the Hindi newspapers sixfold, with The Tribune as the leader with a circulation of approximately 50,000 copies. Dainik Bhaskar's survey suggested that residents of Chandigarh preferred English newspapers due to quality perceptions. As a result, the newspaper incorporated the local Chandigarh dialect in the design, mixing Hindi and English. Dainik Bhaskar launched in Chandigarh in May 2000 with 69,000 copies sold making it No.1 in the city. In June 2000, Dainik Bhaskar entered Haryana, with 271,000 copies. In 2006, Dainik Bhaskar launched in Punjab with the Amritsar and Jalandhar editions and became the No.1 newspaper on the first day, displacing established legacy players. Later, it increased its presence in Punjab in Ludhiana and Bhatinda. In 2010, Dainik Bhaskar entered the Jharkhand market with the launch of a Ranchi edition, followed by Jamshedpur and Dhanbad editions. In January 2014, Dainik Bhaskar entered Bihar with a successful launch in Patna It followed with launch of Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Gaya editions in 2015. In April 2014, Dainik Bhaskar Group launches online Hindi edition in Uttar Pradesh.

These transmissions may belong to different users (as in TDMA) or to the same user (as in OFDM). The purpose of the guard interval is to introduce immunity to propagation delays, echoes and reflections, to which digital data is normally very sensitive.  Use in digital communications systems  In OFDM, the beginning of each symbol is preceded by a guard interval. As long as the echoes fall within this interval, they will not affect the receiver's ability to safely decode the actual data, as data is only interpreted outside the guard interval. In TDMA, each user's timeslot ends with a guard period, to avoid data loss and to reduce interference to the following user, caused by propagation delay. Thus a user's timeslot is protected from interference from the preceding user, by the guard interval (guard period) at the end of that preceding user's timeslot. It is a common misconception that each TDMA timeslot begins with a guard interval, however the ITU Technical Specifications (such as GSM 05.05) clearly define the guard period as being at the end of each timeslot, thus providing protection against data loss within that timeslot, and protection against interference to the following timeslot. Longer guard periods allow more distant echoes to be tolerated. However, longer guard intervals reduce the channel efficiency. For example, in DVB-T, four guard intervals are available (given as fractions of a symbol period): :1/32 ; 1/16 ; 1/8 ; 1/4 Hence, 1/32 gives the lowest protection and the highest data rate; 1/4 results in the best protection but the lowest data rate. Radio waves propagate at the speed of light, per 1000 meter (5 Œºs/mile). Ideally, the guard interval is just longer than the delay spread of the channel.  802.11 guard interval  The standard symbol guard interval used in IEEE 802.11 OFDM is . To increase data rate, 802.11n added optional support for a guard interval. This provides an 11% increase in data rate. To increase coverage area, IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) provides optional support for , , and guard intervals. The shorter guard interval results in a higher packet error rate when the delay spread of the channel exceed the guard interval and/or if timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver is not precise. A scheme could be developed to work out whether a short guard interval would be of benefit to a particular link. To reduce complexity, manufacturers typically only implement a short guard interval as a final rate adaptation step when the device is running at its highest data rate.Perahia and Stacey, Next Generation Wireless LANs, Cambridge University Press, 2008 See also * Interpacket gap References  External links  * Technical Standard GSM 05.05 Radio Transmission and Reception.

It was established in 1991, and was replaced by the Immigration and Protection Tribunal in 2010. New Zealand established the RSAA as part of its responsibility to uphold the right of asylum as a result of being a signatory of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 160. The decisions of the RSAA are not binding, but have had a significant impact on refugee jurisprudence.Rolf Driver, Aimee Bradbury ‚ÄúRefugee Staatus Determination in New Zealand and Australia‚Äù (2012) September NZLJ 282 at 286. The RSAA was composed of a Chairperson and 24 Members (part-time and full-time), all of whom were either legal practitioners or retired judges. The most high-profile case adjudged by the RSAA was that of Ahmed Zaoui, whose appeal was eventually successful. Jurisdiction and Statutory Authority The RSAA was created under the prerogative powers of the New Zealand Executive (Cabinet) in 1991. The RSAA was later given statutory authority on October 1, 1999 in the Immigration Amendment Act 1999.UNHCR ‚Äì The UN Refugee Agency ‚ÄúNew Zealand: Refugee Status Appeals Authority‚Äù Refworld < http://www.refworld.org>. The RSAA's jurisdiction allowed the body to hear and decide any appeal by a person who had been declined refugee status by a Refugee Status Officer (RSO). The RSAA also made decisions regarding direct applications, cancellation of refugee status when the Refugee Convention may have no longer applied, and when recognition of refugee status should cease due to attaining refugee status by forgery, false or misleading information or concealment of relevant information.AR Mackey Annual Report to 30 June 2010 (Refugee Status Appeals Authority, Annual Report 2010) at 1. The authority was established to work as an independent appellate body. The RSAA was headed by the Chairman who had the discretion to appoint people to hear appeals as he saw fit.Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 161. The Immigration Act stated the Chairperson ‚Äúis responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary or desirable to ensure the orderly and expeditious discharge of the functions of the Authority.Clause 2, Schedule 3C Immigration Act 1987.‚Äù The RSAA was governed by sections 129N ‚Äì 129Z of the Immigration Amendment Act 1999. The two main functions were: ‚Äúto hear appeals brought under section 129O from determinations by RSO‚Äôs not to recognise a claimant as a refugeeImmigration Amendment Act 1999 s129(2)(a).‚Äù; and ‚Äúto make determinations in relation to a person's refugee status on applications made by RSO‚Äôs under section 129L(1)(f).Immigration Amendment Act 1999 s129(2)(b).\\" Proceedings For a claim to be successful, the claimant had to establish a \\"well-founded fear of persecution\\" by fulfilling the standard of proof. To determine whether this standard had been met, the RSAA had the powers of the Commission of Enquiry to verify facts and produce likely scenarios that may occur upon the claimant's return to their country of origin.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 165-166. These powers of enquiry were important considering the unique nature of the cases the body was dealing with.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 9.1.5. The RSAA interpreted ‚Äòwell-founded fear‚Äô as meaning a ‚Äòreal chance‚Äô that persecution would occur. This was to avoid formulating possibilities that may not eventuate. If the RSAA decided there was a real chance of persecution, they would then have to establish whether this fear was due to a reason outlined in the Refugee Convention. The second element of a successful claim was for the appellant to establish the onus of the claim. This was to prevent the decision-maker abusing the power of having the onus.Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 167. The RSAA operated according to the following principles:Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 168. *Gave the \\"benefit of doubt\\" to the claimant when facts or scenarios could not be determined. *Maintained a low threshold for proving of a ‚Äòreal chance‚Äô of persecution. *Conducted proceedings in a non-adversarial manner. Relationship with the Refugee Convention and Human Rights The RSAA had an interesting legal status. The Refugee Convention was not incorporated into New Zealand domestic law, but a framework was inserted in section 129A of the Immigration Act 1987 which emphasised full compliance with the Refugee Convention.Doug Tenant ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 2. This meant that the RSAA could completely focus on the Convention, and also consider international jurisdictions and scholarship in their decisions.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 162. The RSAA used the good faith principle laid out in the article 31 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to interpret the Refugee Convention.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 163. The RSAA also looked to international human rights treaties for guidance such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Bill of Human Rights.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 2.8. Due to its ability to take all of these sources into account, the RSAA was praised for its clarity.Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 163. This opened up an opportunity for the RSAA to make decisions that were significant internationally. Contribution to International Refugee Jurisprudence =Failure of state protection= A successful claimant must have shown that their state of origin had failed or will fail to prevent a real chance of persecution.Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees article 1A(2). In order to clear up this confusing area, the RSAA added four criteria, which Doug Tennant summarised as being:Doug Tennent ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 172. #Persecution committed by state concerned. #Persecution condoned by state concerned. #Persecution tolerated by state concerned. #Persecution not condoned or tolerated by state concerned, but present due to refusal or unable to offer protection. These criteria put an emphasis on state failure to protect as opposed to the focusing on state complicity to persecution. =Member of a particular social group= One of the grounds for being a refugee is membership of a particular social group.Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees article 1A(2). The RSAA made numerous important decisions in this area. The RSAA decided to follow the approach in WardCanada (Attorney General) v Ward [1993] 2 SCR 689. to determine a particular social group by identifying crucial factors of an individual's identity or conscience. This is referred to as a ‚Äúprotected characteristic.Fatma E Marouf ‚ÄúThe Emerging Importance of ‚ÄòSocial Visibility‚Äô in Defining a ‚ÄòParticular Social Group‚Äô and Its Potential Impact on Asylum Claims Related to Sexual Orientation and Gender‚Äù (2008) 27 Yale Law and Policy Review 47 at 56.‚Äù The RSAA made high-profile decisions concerning sexual orientation and gender discrimination as particular social groups for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 173. Sexual Orientation In Refugee Appeal No 1312/93Refugee Appeal No 1312/9 [RE GE] (30 August 1995). the claimant had become a practicing homosexual since his arrival in New Zealand. He was originally from Iran and it was well established that homosexuality would be punished if he was sent back home. The RSAA had to decide whether having a certain sexual orientation constituted a membership of a particular social group.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 6.6.2(e). The RSAA held that homosexuality was a particular social group. The Authority was guided by writings by James C. Hathaway, the US Courts, the Supreme Court of Canada and human rights to come to this decision.Doug Tenant ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 6.6.2(e). This approach towards sexual orientation was cited by the House of Lords in Islam Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIslam Secretary of State for the Home Department Reported as Re GJ [1998] INLR 387. and Regina v Immigration Appeal Tribunal + another ex parte Shah AP.Regina v Immigration Appeal Tribunal + another ex parte Shah AP [consolidated appeals] (1999) 2 WLR 1015 (House of Lords).Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L. Rev. 160 at 178. Gender Discrimination Both Refugee Appeal No 2039/93Refugee Appeal No 2039/93 [Re MN] (12 February 1996). and Refugee Appeal No 71427/99Refugee Appeal No 71427/99 (16 August 2000). held that in certain circumstances being a woman can amount to being a member of a particular social group. In Refugee Appeal No 2039/93 the claimant was not a virgin and if she was returned home and forced to marry, this could have potentially resulted in her death. The claimant in this case had also under-gone a ‚Äòself-awareness process‚Äô that made her opposed to the oppression of women in Iranian society. In Refugee Appeal No 71427/99 the claimant had divorced her abusive husband and had rediscovered her child he had adopted out without her knowing. If she had been returned to Iran, she would have been subjected to death or imprisonment.Doug Tenant ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 6.6.2(f). In both of these cases the RSAA used human rights approaches to decide that in some cases being a woman constituted membership of a particular social group. Particular rights that were considered included: right to privacy,International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights article 17. the right to life,International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights article 6. freedom of thought, conscience and religion,International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights article 18. the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishmentInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights article 7. and right not to marry without full and free consent.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights article 23. The RSAA also took into account Iranian society and its tolerance of domestic violence and the denial to recognise women as human beings possessing the same status as men.Doug Tenant ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 6.6.2(f). The gender discrimination cases were also ground-breaking because they established that persecution was \\"serious harm + failure of state protection\\". Both of these elements must be present for there to be refugee status. However, only one of these grounds needs to have a nexus with the Refugee Convention. For example, in Refugee Appeal No 71427/99 a link with the Refugee Convention could only be found with the failure of state protection. The RSAA held that a link with one of the constructs was sufficient for refugee status.Doug Tennent ‚ÄúImmigration and Refugee Law‚Äù 1st edition, Lexis Nexis, Wellington 2010 at 6.6.2(f). This approach was followed by the Australian High Court in Khawar.Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar (1997) 190 CLR 225 (HCA).Doug Tennant ‚ÄúThe Contribution of New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (2007) 15 Waikato L.

High Profile Cases =Zaoui CaseZaoui v Attorney- General (No 2) [2005] 1 NZLR 690 (CA), 1 NZLR 289 (SCNZ).= Zaoui‚Äôs case received a lot of media attention in New Zealand since it was the first time a New Zealand Security Risk Certificate was awarded.Claudia Geriringer ‚ÄúZaoui Revisited‚Äù (2005) August NZLJ 285 at 285. When Zaoui first arrived in New Zealand, he claimed asylum following a military coup in Algeria. The Refugee Status Branch of the New Zealand Immigration Service, said there was a well- founded dear of persecution, but refugee status was denied due to evidence given by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) that indicated Zaoui's involvement in criminal and terrorist activity.Christine Brichenstein ‚ÄúAn Evaluation of the Zaoui Case‚Äù (2009) October NZLJ 356 at 356. On appeal to the RSAA, refugee status was awarded. However, the Security Risk Certificate that was issued resulted in over two years in detention. In a Supreme Court decision, Zaoui was successful in being released from detention, indicating that a Security Risk Certificate should not override a RSAA decision. In Zaoui v Attorney-General (No 2) the Supreme Court established that it was the role of the Minister of Immigration and not the Inspector-General to determine whether Zaoui was a threat that should be removed from New Zealand.Christine Brichenstein ‚ÄúAn Evaluation of the Zaoui Case‚Äù (2009) October NZLJ 356 at 357. The Zaoui case reached a conclusion in September 2007, when the SIS withdrew their objections and Zaoui was allowed to remain in New Zealand.Christine Brichenstein ‚ÄúAn Evaluation of the Zaoui Case‚Äù (2009) October NZLJ 356 at 357. =Refugee Appeal No. 76204Refugee Appeal No 76204 [2009] NZRSAA 12 (16 February 2009).= This appeal case involved the third appeal of an Iranian claimant who had converted to Christianity. The first appeal was unsuccessful due to issues of credibility and the second appeal was unsuccessful due to his provision of false documentation. His case attracted media attention during his time in prison awaiting his deportation to Iran when he started religious fasting. The media attention meant that Iran became aware of the claimant's conversion, putting him in danger if he did return home. The RSAA decided the third appeal in the claimant's favour due to a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of religion.Johanna Commins ‚ÄúGood Faith in the Immigration Act‚Äù (2011) April NZLJ 103 at 104. =Tamil X CaseTamil X v Refugee Status Appeals Authority [2010] 2 NZLR 73.= The claimant was an engineer on a ship that was owned by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The ship he was working on sank after it was fired upon by the Indian Navy. The claimant was charged with firing upon Indian Navy ships and was imprisoned in India for three years. Upon his release, he and his wife came to New Zealand claiming refugee status. The RSAA denied him refugee status due to his potential involvement in war crimes or crimes against humanity. At the Supreme Court of New Zealand, the court ruled that there was not enough evidence that the claimant had been involved in a war crime or crime against humanity to put him under the exclusion clause contained in article 1F of the Refugee Convention. His appeal was allowed, and case re-emitted to the RSAA.Tamil X v Refugee Status Appeals Authority [2010] 2 NZLR 73 at 1. Replacement by the Immigration and Protection Tribunal The RSAA was replaced by the Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) on November 29, 2010. The IPT was established by section 217 of the Immigration Act 2009. The IPT subsumed four bodies that were formally, the Residence Review Board, Removal Review Authority, Refugee Status Appeals Authority and the Deportation Review Tribunal.Judge Hastings First Annual Report (Immigration and Protection Tribunal, Annual Report 2010/2011) at 1.

He was born at Ulail in Dhaka district of Bengal province in British India (now Dhaka District of Bangladesh). His major contribution to Bengali literature was the collection and compilation of Bengali folk and fairy tales in four volumes - Thakurmar Jhuli (Grandmother's Bag of Tales), Thakurdadar Jhuli (Grandfather's Bag of Tales), Thandidir Thale (Maternal-Grandmother's Bag of Tales) and Dadamashayer Thale (Maternal-Grandfather's Bag of Tales). Early Life Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar was born in the village of Ulail, near Savar in Dhaka district. He lost his mother when he was nine, and was brought up by his paternal aunt, Rajlakkhi Devi, in Mymensingh. Dakhshinaranjan recounts the memories of listening to fairytales told by his mother as well as his aunt, in his introduction to Thakurmar Jhuli. At the age of twenty-one, he moved to Murshidabad with his father. Education was not his strong suit, he had to change schools multiple times. However, his father's collection of books was a comfort to him. In Murshidabad, he began to write in different journals, including the Sahitya Parisat Patrika and Pradip. At 25, he published a collection of poems called Utthan (Ascent). On completing his F.A. degree, he returned to Mymensingh, and took over the task of overseeing his aunt's zamindari. Contribution to folk literature Rabindranath Tagore notes in his introduction to Thakurmar Jhuli, that there was a dire need for folk literature of Bengal to be revived because the only such works available to the reading public of the time were European fairytales and their translations. He expressed the need for a swadeshi or indigenous folk literature that would remind the people of Bengal of their rich oral traditions. This would be a method of contending the cultural imperialism of the British. Dakhshinaranjan's aunt, Rajlakkhi Debi had given him the duty of visiting the villages in their zamindari. Dakhshinaranjan travelled and listened to Bengali folktales and fairytales being narrated by the village elders. He recorded this material with a phonograph that he carried, and listened to the recordings repeatedly, imbibing the style. Inspired by Dinesh Chandra Sen, he edited and published the material he had collected in Thakurmar Jhuli(1907), Thakurdadar Jhuli(1909), Thandidir Thale(1909), and Dadamashayer Thale(1913). He also translated fairytales from different parts of the world in the collection Prithibir Rupkotha (Fairytales of the World). Other contributions Dakshinaranjan also edited a number of journals such as Sudha (1901‚Äì1904), Sarathi (1908) and Path (1930‚Äì1932). He was the mouthpiece of the Bengal Scientific Council of which he was vice-president from 1930 to 1933. As president of the Scientific Terminology Board of the Council he was able to contribute to the development of terminology. Death He died of gastric ulcer in his Kolkata residence, on 30 March 1957. Works * Thakurmar Jhuli (1907)- This anthology has attained iconic status in Bengali children's literature. In his introduction, Tagore noted that Dakhshinaranjan has successfully put into writing, the linguistic flavour of traditional oral tales. In 1907, Thakurmar Jhuli was published by the renowned publisher, Bhattacharya and Sons. Within a week, three thousand copies were sold. Several illustrations for the collection were also drawn by the author. His drawings were turned into lithographs for printing. * Thakurdadar Jhuli (1909)- The tales in this collection are notable for their frequent use of song. The author notes in the introduction, that these were ritual tales, to be told and sung to pregnant women, or on the occasion of the completion of a religious vow or brata. * Thandidir Thale (1909) * Dadamashayer Thale (1913) * Charu O Haru * First Boy * Last Boy * Utpal O Rabi * Banglar Bratakatha * Sabuj Lekha * Amar Desh * Ashirbad O Ashirbani * Manush Kishore * Kishorder Man * Banglar Sonar Chhele * Bijnaner Rupkatha * Natun Katha * Rupak Katha * Srishtir Swapna * Chiradiner Rupkatha * Amar Bai * Karmer murti * Sonar chala References Bengali writers Bengali-language writers Indian children's writers University of Calcutta alumni 1957 deaths 1877 births 20th-century Indian people Writers from Dhaka ","title":"Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder"},{"id":"4013173","text":"A view of Birecik district Birecik (Greek and Latin: Birtha, ; ; , ), also formerly known as Bir, Bir√©, Biradjik and during the Crusades as Bile, is a town and district of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province of Turkey, on the River Euphrates.

A New Early Bronze Age Cemetery: Excavation near the Birecik Dam, Southeastern Turkey. Preliminary Report (1997-98) Anatolica 25: 87-107  Ancient city  The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica identified Birecik with ancient Apamea or its suburb Seleucia and described it as opposite Zeugma, with which it was connected by a bridge of boats. At the same time, it added that \\"the place seems to have had a pre-Seleucid existence as Birtha, a name which revived under Roman rule\\". Later discoveries have shown that the identification with Apamea and its Zeugma (the word zeugma meant junction and referred to a junction of roads at a point where a pontoon bridge crossed a river)Christina Phelps Grant, The Syrian Desert (Routledge 2013 ), p. 41, footnote is false: Bali, some 17 kilometres upstream is now seen as the site of Zeugma, and there may have been no bridge of boats at Birtha/Birecik until the crossings at Zeugma and at Tell-Ahmar (further down) lost popularity.Christina Phelps Grant, The Syrian Desert (Routledge 2013 ), p. 165, footnote These, rather than the crossing at Birecik/Birtha may therefore be what the 1911 publication said \\"was used from time immemorial in the passage from North Syria to Haran (Charrae), Edessa and North Mesopotamia, and was second in importance only to that at Thapsacus, by which crossed the route to Babylon and South Mesopotamia.\\" The placing of Apamea-Zeugma further upstream and the identification of Birecik with Roman Birtha was already stated in the American Journal of Archaeology in 1917;American Journal of Archaeology, 1917, p. 453 and William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) clearly identified Birtha with Birecik, although at another point it seems to confuse it with \\"the Zeugma of Commagene\\", the province on the right/west bank of the river. The name \\"Birtha\\" is found in no ancient Greek or Roman writer, although Bithra (Greek: ) (probably meant for \\"Birtha\\")Glen Warren Bowersock, Julian the Apostate (Harvard University Press 1997 ), p. 112 appears in the account by Zosimus of the invasion of Mesopotamia by Roman Emperor Julian in AD 363. The Greeks at one stage called what is now Birecik by the name Macedonopolis (anglicized also as Makedonoupolis) The city represented by bishops at the First Council of Nicaea and the Council of Chalcedon is called by this name in Latin and Greek records, but Birtha in Syriac texts.

Life Steinberg was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR, the son of Isaac Nachman Steinberg, a Jewish lawyer and Socialist Revolutionary Party politician who was People's Commissar of Justice under Vladimir Lenin from 1917 to 1918. His family left the Soviet Union in 1923, and settled in Berlin, Germany. In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, the Steinbergs were forced to move again, this time to the United Kingdom. Intending to become an artist, Steinberg studied at the Slade School of Fine Art (part of the University of London). In 1945, encouraged by his older sister and her husband, Steinberg moved to New York City. For years he made a living writing art criticism and teaching art, including at the Parsons School of Design. In 1957, William Kolodney invited Steinberg to give a lecture series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \\"Change and Permanence in Western Art\\" focused on ten periods of art, dealing with problems or solutions with special relevance to modern thought and taste.\\"Art History Lecture Courses: 1957‚Äì1958\\", season program, p. 3, The Metropolitan Museum of Art The importance of his criticism of modern art was proven by his being included in Tom Wolfe's 1975 book The Painted Word, in which Steinberg, Harold Rosenberg, and Clement Greenberg were all labeled the \\"kings of Cultureburg\\" for the influence of their criticism. Steinberg eventually moved away from art criticism and developed a scholarly interest in such artists and architects as Francesco Borromini, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.The Art Story: Art Critic - Leo Steinberg In 1960, he earned his PhD at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts with a dissertation on the architectural symbolism of Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. Subsequently, he taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York. In 1975, he was appointed Benjamin Franklin Professor of the History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught until retiring in 1991. From 1995 to 1996, Steinberg was a guest professor at Harvard University, delivering the Charles Eliot Norton lectures on \\"The Mute Image and the Meddling Text.\\" Steinberg approached the history of art in a revolutionary manner, helping to move it from a dry consideration of factual details, documents, and iconographic symbols to a more dynamic understanding of meaning conveyed via various artistic choices. For example, in 1972, Steinberg introduced the idea of the \\"flatbed picture plane\\" in his book Other Criteria, a collection of essays. The whole of the Summer, 1983, issue of the journal October was dedicated to Steinberg's essay The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion, later published as a book by Random House and by publishers in other countries. In that essay, Steinberg examined a previously ignored pattern in Renaissance art: the prominent display of the genitals of the infant Christ and the attention also drawn to that area in images of Christ near the end of his life, in both cases for specific theological reasons involving the concept of the Incarnation ‚Äì the word of God made flesh.The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion, October, No. 25, (Summer) 1983 Steinberg died on March 13, 2011, in New York City at the age of 90. Steinberg's collection of 3,200 prints is held at The Leo Steinberg Collection, Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas, Austin.\\"Honorary degrees are awarded\\" , Harvard University, June 8, 2006 His papers are held at the Getty Research Institute.Inventory of the Leo Steinberg Research Papers Personal life In 1962 Steinberg married Dorothy Seiberling, an art editor for Life magazine; the marriage ended in divorce. For more than 40 years, Sheila Schwartz was his \\"indispensable collaborator\\", assistant and editor. Steinberg had no children. Awards * 1983 Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters * 1984, Frank Jewett Mather Award in Art Journalism, College Art Association * 1986 MacArthur Fellows Program Thesis Steinberg's research particularly focused on the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and other Italian Renaissance artists and their depictions of Christ in art. As a critic, he produced important work on Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning. One of his most significant essays was Contemporary Art and the Plight of its Public, which appeared in March 1962 in Harper's Magazine. Steinberg took an informal approach to criticism, sometimes using a first-person narrative in his essays, which personalized the experience of art for readers. This was in juxtaposition to many formalist critics at the time, such as Clement Greenberg, who were known to be resolute in their writing. In many of his writings, he expressed his love for art's ability not only to reflect life but also to become it and commented, \\"Anything anybody can do, painting does better.\\" He believed that the difference between modern painting and that of the Old Masters was the viewer's subjective experience of that artwork. He also believed that Abstract Expressionist action painters, such as Jackson Pollock, were more concerned with creating good art than with merely expressing a personal identity on canvas, a point of view contrary to that held by Harold Rosenberg, another American art critic of Steinberg's era.

Population  Zackenberg Station The park has no permanent human population, although 400 sites see occasional summertime use. In 1986, the population of the park was 40, living at Mestersvig. These 40 were involved in cleanup and closeout operations at mining exploration sites and soon left. Since then censuses have recorded zero permanent human population.

The research station ZERO (Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations) can cater for over 20 scientists and station personnel. Fauna Iceberg in the national park An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 musk oxen, as well as numerous polar bears and walrus, can be found near the coastal regions of the park. In 1993, this was estimated to be 40% of the world population of musk ox. Other mammals include Arctic fox, stoat, collared lemming, Arctic hare and a small but important population of Greenland wolf. Other marine mammals include ringed seal, bearded seal, harp seal and hooded seal as well as narwhal and beluga whale.

Mac Mall signed with the record label, Young Black Brotha Records, and later came to own the label, for the production of his own albums, and those of associates.Shapiro, Peter (2005) \\"Mac Mall\\" in The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop, 2nd edn., Rough Guides, , p. 241-242 One of Mac Mall's first singles was a song called \\"Ghetto Theme\\", which had a music video directed by Tupac Shakur in 1994. He was also longtime friends with Mac Dre, who was his mentor early on in his career. He is also cousins to E-40, B-Legit and Sway Calloway. Career In 1993, Mac Mall released his debut album Illegal Business? on Young Black Brotha Records. Entirely produced by Khayree Shaheed, the album featured Ray Luv and Mac Dre. Illegal Business? moved over 200,000 units independently, a major feat for an independent artist and record label. He met Tupac Shakur shortly after the album's release, who after praising Mac's music offered to direct a video for the single \\"Ghetto Theme\\". In 1995 he contributed a verse to E-40's \\"Dusted and Disgusted\\" and Eightball & MJG's \\"Friend or Foe\\". In 1996 he signed a record deal with Relativity Records, which released his second, and most commercially successful album, Untouchable.Birchmeier, Jason \\"[ Mac Mall Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation In 1996, he appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America Is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \\"a masterpiece\\" by The Source magazine. In 1999, he started his own Sesed Out Records label, the first release being the compilation Mac Mall Presents the Mallennium, followed by his first solo album on the label and third overall, Illegal Business? 2000 a year later. Though no longer on a major label, he still managed to achieve success on Illegal Business? 2000, which spawned what is perhaps his most well known single, \\"Wide Open\\". Immaculate followed in 2001, which would find him once again reuniting with longtime collaborator Khayree Shaheed. After 2002's Mackin Speaks Louder Than Words, he took a 4-year hiatus from solo albums, instead focusing on collaborative efforts with JT the Bigga Figga and Mac Dre. He began work on an album with Mac Dre, which would be called Da U.S. Open. Unfortunately, Dre passed before the album was released, and it ended up being some of Dre's final recordings.Azpiri, John \\"[ Immaculate Review]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation In 2006, Mac Mall returned with his first solo album on Thizz Entertainment, Thizziana Stoned and the Temple of Shrooms. \\"Perfect Poison\\", a song off of the album, was featured in the video game Skate. He followed up Thizziana with Mac To The Future in 2009, becoming his second solo album with Thizz. In 2011, Mac Mall announced that he will release an album in November called The Rebellion Against All There Is. It will be a joint release with his own label Thizzlamic Records, and Young Black Brotha Records. The Rebellion Against All There Is will include 17 tracks, with features from Ray Luv, Shima, Boss Hogg, Luiyo La Musico and Latriece Love. The first single from the album is \\"To Live In The Bay\\". Moreover, Mac reunites with producer Khayree, who is said to be producing the whole effort. Seventeen years ago, Khayree produced Mac's Young Black Brotha Records debut, Illegal Business?. It has been 12 years since the Bay Area pair worked together.

Accelerator tables are usually located in the resources section of the binary. Accelerators and menus Each accelerator is associated with a control ID, the same kind of IDs which are assigned to buttons, combo boxes, list boxes, and also menu items. In this way, GUI objects can be created which represent the same function as an accelerator. Since using the menus, and subsequently the mouse, is not always the best solution, it is important to provide users with the possibility to minimize usage of the mouse. For this reason showing the accelerators in menus can be useful; it informs the user that there are shortcuts, and that using the mouse is not always mandatory.

Shalleck (November 14, 1929 ‚Äì February 6, 2006) was an American writer and producer for children's programming on television, most known for his work on later Curious George books and the 1980s television shorts. Shalleck studied drama at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York and went to work for CBS in the 1950s, eventually becoming an associate producer on the children's television series Winky Dink and You. In the early sixties he moved to Montreal where he produced \\"Like Young\\", at CFCF-TV, a highly successful teen music/dance show starring Jim McKenna that was eventually picked up and syndicated by Dick Clark Productions. Following his years at CBS, and CFCF-TV Shalleck was a producer at The Network for Continuing Medical Education and then formed his own production company (AJ Shalleck Productions) and produced a number of low-budget children's animated films and television episodes. In 1977, he approached Margret Rey about producing a television series based on Curious George, which led to the 1980 television show. Shalleck and Rey wrote more than 100 short episodes for the series. In addition, they collaborated on a number of children's books and audiobooks. (Some of these books list Rey as the author and Shalleck as the editor, while others reverse the credits.) In his retirement, Shalleck created the company \\"Reading By GRAMPS\\" and visited local elementary schools, bookstores, and other events to read books to children and promote literacy. However, he also experienced financial problems and was forced to supplement his income with part-time jobs. He most recently worked as a bookseller for Borders Books in Boynton Beach, Florida. On February 7, 2006, a few days before the theatrical release of a Curious George animated motion picture, Shalleck's body was discovered, partially hidden, at his home in Boynton Beach, Florida, a victim of a robbery/homicide. His attackers were tracked down using the victim's phone records. They confessed to the crime. On October 19, 2007, one of Shalleck's murderers, 31-year-old Rex Ditto, was sentenced to life in prison and is not eligible for parole.

The game is played with a stripped deck, i.e. one that has its twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, and kings removed. This game is named after the female- led tribe, the Amazons, because the queen is the highest card, and all queens are shown if the game is won.\\"Amazons\\" (p.14) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. Rules First, four cards are dealt. They would be the reserve. Above it is a space for the foundations. Once an ace is available, it is placed on the foundations and each ace should be placed in order on which they become available. The first four cards dealt are the bases of the reserve piles, the top card of each being available only to the foundation immediately above it. The exception to this rule is a queen can be moved to its foundation from any pile. The order of placing is A-7-8-9-10-J-Q. When play goes on a standstill, four more cards are then dealt, one on each reserve pile, and stop to see if any of the cards dealt can be placed on the foundations. Spaces are not filled until the next deal. This process is repeated until the stock runs out. When it does, a new stock is formed by placing each pile over its right- hand neighbor, turn them face down and deal; this should be done without reshuffling. The process of dealing the cards, building to the foundations, and redealing, is repeated without limits until the game is won or lost. The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations, with the queens at the top. Strategy Given the unlimited redeals, one of the best strategies for winning Amazons in as many as half the games played is to only play one Ace at a time rather than all of them initially, working on a single foundation at a time, and only playing another Ace when stuck despite redealing.

Alexander developed his own way of dealing with his daughters' problems. \\"He used to say: 'Now, the news of your misbehaviour make me suffer enormously' and I tried my best to somehow harness this nasty temper of mine ‚Äì if only to relieve him from those sufferings,\\" Vertinskaya remembered decades later. = Career = Young Anastasiya Vertinskaya was thinking of a career in linguistics, but things changed overnight in 1961 when the then sixteen-year-old was approached personally by the film director Aleksandr Ptushko for the role of Assol in Scarlet Sails. The romantic teenage drama based on Alexander Grin's novel became an instant success, making Anastasiya a national celebrity. Many of the future stars of Soviet cinema, including Vasily Lanovoy, Ivan Pereverzev, Sergey Martinson, and Oleg Anofriev, were in the cast, but, as critics noted, it was Vertinskaya's passionate performance that gave Scarlet Sails its flavour. 23 million people viewed the film during its first year. In 1962 Vertinskaya starred in the Amphibian Man, Gennady Kazansky and Vladimir Chebotarev's adaptation of Alexander Belyayev's science fiction novel of the same title. Cast as Gutierrez, a young woman in love with an amphibian man, Vertinskaya had to go through difficult late autumn underwater shooting sessions which she performed all by herself, without any stuntwomen involved. The film became the Soviet 1962 box-office blockbuster. \\"Vertinskaya was now a brand. People were going to the cinema to watch her, specifically,\\" her future husband Nikita Mikhalkov later recalled. All this changed the teenage actress's life dramatically. \\"In those days there weren't any bodyguards. I used to travel by tram to my studies. I had to queue for bread like everyone else. Not only was I recognized, they made a point of touching me too... It was in those days that I developed the fear of crowds... This immense psychic violence haunted me all through those years,\\" she later remembered.Express- Gazeta. Anastasiya Vertinskaya: The Early Fame Damaged Me Greatly. ‚Äì 21 December 2009 At the KVIFF with Renate Blume, 1964 In 1962 Vertinskaya joined the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre troupe. This meant that from then on she had to continuously tour the country with the then popular so-called \\"theater brigades\\". In 1963, assisted by Lyudmila Maksakova, her elder sister Marianna's friend, Vertinskaya enrolled into the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute. The young actress' eagerness to act was, in her own words, \\"next to maniacal.\\" Nikita Mikhalkov was one of her fellow students. They fell in love and married in 1966, only to be divorced three years later. The role of Ophelia in the 1964 Grigori Kozintsev film Hamlet (starring Innokentiy Smoktunovsky) made Vertinskaya known internationallyShelokhonov, Steve. www.imdb.com Biography for Anastasiya Vertinskaya. IMDb. and proved to be a turning point in her career. As Kozintsev later wrote, Vertinskaya's strength was her \\"fragile purity and this Renaissance look she had.\\" For the young actress working next to masters like Smoktunovsky proved to be invaluable in terms of learning, introducing the young actress to many of what she called \\"this magic kitchen's secrets.\\" \\"Ophelia made me realize for the first time that acting was indeed my destiny,\\" she later said. While still at the Shchukin Theatre Institute, Vertinskaya received the role of Princess Bolkonsky in Sergey Bondarchuk's epic adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace (1966‚Äì1967). It was her sensual, touchingly naive portrayal that gave this character a new, humane dimension. This was the director's idea. According to Vertinskaya, Vertinskaya said it was War and Peace that taught her how to \\"create a deep tragic undercurrent in something that on the face of it bears no sign of tragedy whatsoever.\\" Less famous but still highly respectable was her performance as Kittie Shcherbatskaya in Aleksandr Zarkhi's 1968 adaptation of Anna Karenina. Among other late 1960s Vertinskaya's films were Hold Your Head Up! (Ne goryui!, by Georgy Daneliya), The Polunin's Case (Slutchay s Poluninym, adapted from Konstantin Simonov's book, and The Preliminary Man (Prezhdevremennyi tchelovek), Abram Room's adaptation of Maxim Gorky's unfinished novel Yakov Bogomolov. = Vertinskaya in theatre = In 1967 Vertinskaya joined the Vakhtangov Theatre troupe and spent there one season, before moving to Sovremennik in 1968, where she stayed until 1980.Anastasiya Vertinskaya in the Krugosvet (Around the World) Encyclopedia. www.krugosvet.ru. ‚Äì 23 December 2009 Theatrical experience was, admittedly, of the utmost importance to an actress who never felt confident enough while acting in movies. \\"I was a slow developer,\\" she admitted years later. In Sovremennik she starred as Olivia (Twelfth Night), Ranevskaya (The Cherry Orchard) and Valentina (Mikhail Roshchin's Valentin and Valentina). In 1980 Vertinskaya left Sovremennik for the Moscow Art Theater. \\"It was only here that I acquired the level of professionalism I was craving for,\\" she said in an interview years later. At MAT Vertinskaya mastered two roles from Anton Chekhov's repertoire, traditionally regarded as difficult: Nina Zarechnaya (The Seagull) and Yelena Andreyevna (Uncle Vanya). Critics praised Vertinskaya's performances, \\"emotionally charged, yet perfectly controlled.\\" Among her other triumphs of the time were Elmire in Moli√®re's Tartuffe directed by Anatoly Efros, Liza Protasova (Lev Tolstoy's Living Corpse), Natasha (Alone with Everybody by Alexander Gelman), and Pat (Mother-of-Pearl Zinaida by Mikhail Roshchin). In 1989 Vertinskaya portrayed her own father in The Mirage or the Russian Pierrot's Way, a show that she herself wrote a script for and directed to mark the centennial birthday anniversary of Alexander Vertinsky. Vertinskaya excelled in her Shakespearean roles. First, in a theatrical experiment staged by director Anatoly Efros at Taganka Theatre, she played both Prospero and Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest, premiered at the Moscow Pushkin Museum. Highly original was her Olivia in Peter James's Sheffield Theatre production of Twelfth Night (1975), better known to Russian audiences for its televised version, which premiered in 1978. This role, in which Vertinskaya was allowed to demonstrate her comic talent for the first time, remains one of her personal favourites.A.Vertinskaya. For the Actress' Jubilee .

She remembered how in Sovremennik (after Ophelia made her known internationally) she was shifted back to the mass scenes. Yevgeny Yevstigneev complained bitterly because the moment he (as the King in The Naked King) stepped on stage the audience responded in a hushed collective whisper: \\"Look over there, it's Vertinskaya in the crowd!\\"Mak, Irina. The Actress Anastasiya Vertinskaya: Erogenous Zone of Eating: It Goes Back to Our Childhood . ‚Äì 29 October 2009 Occasionally, Vertinskaya remembered, she had to artificially \\"simplify\\" her facial features (even to stuff her nostrils) so as to fit the Soviet \\"common heroine\\" stereotype. \\"In those times, they demanded a different kind of heroine: ruddy-faced cheerful 'activistkas'\\", ‚Äì the actress responded when asked about huge gaps in her working schedule in the early 1970s. In 1978 the film Nameless Star (an adaptation of Mihail Sebastian's play) premiered on Soviet TV. The film's director (and also a well-known actor) Mikhail Kozakov gave Vertinskaya (with whom he was having a passionate love affair at the time) total freedom of improvisation, letting the two ‚Äì Mona the character and Anastasiya the performer ‚Äì almost merge. The film (where her partner was Igor Kostolevsky) remained one of Vertinskaya's all time favorites. The officials, however, disliked it. Her next two films were The Gadfly (1980), based on Ethel Lilian Voynich's novel, where she played Jemma (her male counterpart, the then debutant, Andrey Kharitonov, later filmed her as a director) and The Theft, based on a play by Jack London, starring Innokenty Smoktunovsky. As time went by, Vertinskaya was feeling more and more dissatisfied with what was going on around her ‚Äì on stage and beyond. Twenty years later one critic called her a \\"symbol of the decades\\": \\"In the 60's she was a dream-girl, in the 70's ‚Äì a style emblem, in the 80's ‚Äì a movie idol.\\" The feeling of frustration that was in the air, touched her as well. Vertinskaya's later work, including Margarita in The Master and Margarita (1994, directed by Yuri Kara and released only in 2011), another of her personal favourites, was made against the background of general decline in national cinema and culture in general. = Retirement = Vertinskaya and Smoktunovsky in Hamlet. 1966 Soviet postage stamp In 1989 the invitation came from the Oxford University for Vertinskaya and Alexander Kalyagin to give master classes on theatrical craftsmanship.

After Oxford Vertinskaya taught drama at the Comedie-Francaise (Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique), at the Chekhov Theatre school, and at EFAS (European Film Actor School). Her play Chekhov, Act III, compiled of third acts from the Russian playwright's three classic plays ran successfully at the Th√©√¢tre Nanterre-Amandiers. Later she warmly remembered her European students' passionate love of the arts and their determination. In 2000 Vertinskaya returned home. In 2002 she appeared in Imago, the stage production based upon M. Kurochkin's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion directed by Nina Tchusova. In her 2009 Izvestiya interview Vertinskaya expressed regret about how little worthy roles were there to be found in the modern Russian theatre and said she'd rather stay away from the stage at all than start playing \\"hitmen's mums\\" (one such suggestion she had received). \\"I have no immediate plans concerning the stage and see no personal drama in it,\\" she said.Anastasiya Vertinskaya. ‚Äì Izvestia interview, 2009.

Some critics praised the way the director has managed to turn the young drama student's lack of self-confidence into an artistic statement, others were less impressed. According to Nekhoroshev, \\"cast into the set of directorial ideas, as if they were the iron corset of her Elizabethan dress, the young actress couldn't breathe freely in the atmosphere of high art she'd been submerged in.\\" He had to agree, though, that \\"hidden within this rather mechanical Ophelia, certain inner logic and harmony have glimpsed through.\\" E.

Regarded as one of the most significant printmakers of the 20th century, in 1927 Hayter founded the legendary Atelier 17 studio in Paris. Since his death in 1988, it has been known as Atelier Contrepoint. Among the artists who frequented the atelier were Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Mir√≥, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Nemesio Ant√∫nez,Manning, Jo. Etched in Time. Victoria, BC, Canada: Friesen Press, 2015, page 132 Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, Mauricio Lasansky, K.R.H. Sonderborg, Flora Blanc and Catherine Yarrow. He is noted for his innovative work in the development of viscosity printing (a process that exploits varying viscosities of oil-based inks to lay three or more colours on a single intaglio plate). Hayter was equally active as a painter, \\"Hayter, working always with maximum flexibility in painting, drawing, engraving, collage and low relief has invented some of the most central and significant images of this century before most of the other artists of his generation\\", wrote Bryan Robertson. Early life and education Hayter was born in Hackney, London, on 27 December 1901, the son of painter William Harry Hayter. He received a degree in chemistry and geology from King's College London and worked in Abadan, Iran for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from 1922 to 1925. After Hayter returned home to convalesce from an attack of malaria, his company arranged a one-man show at their headquarters in London of the paintings and drawings he had made while overseas. The exhibition's success (almost all the paintings sold) may have convinced Hayter to pursue a career as an artist.  Career  = Paris = In 1926, Hayter went to Paris, where he studied briefly at the Acad√©mie Julian. That same year, he met Polish printmaker J√≥zef Hecht, who introduced Hayter to copper engraving using the traditional burin technique. Hecht helped Hayter acquire a press for starting a printmaking studio for artists young and old, experienced and inexperienced, to work together in exploring the engraving medium. In 1927, Hayter opened the studio, and in 1933 he moved it to No. 17, rue Campagne-Premi√®re, where it became internationally known as Atelier 17. Hayter worked with many contemporary artists to encourage their exploration of printmaking as a medium. Artists such as Mir√≥, Picasso and Kandinsky collaborated on creating print editions (Fraternit√© and Solidarit√©) to raise funds for the support of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil war.Conscience and Conflict, British artists and the Spanish civil war, Simon Martin ‚Äì Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, 2014 = New York City = At the outbreak of World War II, Hayter moved Atelier 17 to New York City and taught printmaking at the New School. Artists such as Jackson Pollock, Mauricio Lasansky and Mark Rothko made prints at the New York Atelier 17. During the war, Hayter collaborated with British artist, historian and poet Roland Penrose and others in setting up a commercial camouflage business: the Industrial Camouflage Research Unit. He also first produced finished prints with the method he called \\"simultaneous color printing,\\" where colour was added to inked intaglio plates by means such as colour-ink-soaked rags, stencils, or rolling a thicker, more viscous ink over a thinner ink, where the thicker ink is rejected and adheres only to the surface surrounding the first ink.Hayter, Stanley William (1949) New Ways of Gravurehttp://www.washingtontimes.com/photos/2009/jun/07/46831/ Washington Times reproduction of \\"Centauresse,\\" a 1944 series of small prints Hayter acted as advisor to the Museum of Modern Art for the show Britain at War. In connection with the exhibition, he devised an analogue computer to duplicate the angle of the sun and shadow lengths for any time, day and latitude. = Paris = Returning to Paris in 1950, Hayter took Atelier 17 with him. Hayter was a prolific printmaker, completing more than 400 works in the medium before his death. In 1949 his book, New Ways of Gravure, was published by Pantheon Books, INC. NY. Oxford University Press published About Prints in 1962. His students included Carmen Gracia. Hayter continued to develop painting alongside printmaking. His interest in automatism led him to associate with the Surrealists, and in the United States he was an innovator in the Abstract Expressionism movement. His legacy in printmaking, which came to dominate its instruction in the American academy, was a vigorous opposition to preparatory drawings and retroussage or hand-wiping with whiting, and endorsement of strong plate tone and improvisation.Raftery, Andrew. \\"Genealogies: Tracing Stanley William Hayter,\\" Art in Print Vol. 2 No. 3 (September‚ÄìOctober 2012). In 2005 the Tate Archive acquired Hayter's papers. Personal life Hayter was married three times: to Edith Fletcher (dissolved 1929), to American sculptor Helen Phillips (dissolved 1971), and to D√©sir√©e Moorhead, with whom he lived in Paris at the time of his death in 1988. He had three sons: Patrick (who died young) from his first marriage, and Augy and Julian Hayter from his second marriage to Helen Phillips. Augy, an actor, writer and translator, died in 2004.

The death of her husband prompted her to dedicate her life to the service of the poor in Rome and she was also known for her ecstatic experiences. Gian Lorenzo Bernini created a sculpture dedicated to her which is contained in San Francesco a Ripa where Albertoni's remains are placed. Her fame for holiness became widespread in Rome and devotion to her remained intense after her death which prompted Pope Clement X to approve her beatification in 1671. Life Ludovica Albertoni was born in 1473 in Rome to the prominent nobles Stefano Albertoni and Lucretia Tebaldi. Her father died around 1475 and she was entrusted to the care of her paternal aunts who saw to it that she had a Christian education. Her parents had arranged her betrothal and in obedience she married the nobleman Giacomo della Cetera in 1494. The couple moved to Trastevere where they raised three daughters, but it was a turbulent marriage since her husband possessed a sharp and often unpleasant temperament. However, she remained docile in her faith and steadfast while believing in her husband's love for her despite his coldness. In May 1506 he died after a long illness leaving her widowed with her three children. Difficulties arose when her brother-in-law Domenico did not respect her rights regarding her inheritance. Albertoni fought him in court and won with her late spouse's assets for her and their daughters. Not long after this loss she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis at the San Francesco a Ripa church in Trastevere. She spent her fortune and her health caring for the poor. Albertoni became renowned for her religious ecstasies (including levitation) and became known as a miracle worker. In 1527 she tended to the poor during the Sack of Rome and for her efforts at alleviating the suffering became known as the \\"mother of the poor\\". In December 1532 news spread that her health was worsening and Albertoni died not long after from a fever on 31 January 1533; her final words were those of Christ's last words on the Cross. Her remains were interred in the Saint Anne chapel at San Francesco a Ripa as was her wish. On 17 January 1674 her remains were relocated to a grand altar in the same church that Gian Lorenzo Bernini had constructed. =Legacy= On 13 October 1606 the senate in Rome decreed the date of her death to be observed like a memorial and in 1625 the Roman authorities named her as a patroness for Rome while making her date of death akin to a liturgical feast. Beatification On 28 January 1671 her beatification received approval from Pope Clement X who voiced approval for her longstanding and popular \\"cultus\\" (otherwise known as an enduring public veneration). The pope signed the decree at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Her liturgical feast is affixed to the date of her death as is the norm. Bernini sculpture Bernini's sculpture of Albertoni in the Altieri chapel of San Francesco a Ripa. Albertoni is best commemorated through Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture entitled Beata Ludovica Albertoni which is housed in the Altieri chapel in the San Francesco a Ripa church in Rome.

During the 1880s, the most popular international auxiliary language was undeniably Volap√ºk. However, after a brief period of overwhelming success, rivalry on the part of the more practical and less complicated Esperanto (published in 1887) led to a rapid decline of the Volap√ºk movement. Many who had previously supported Volap√ºk switched to the Esperanto camp, while others tried their best to improve or reform Volap√ºk itself. Partially due to the inflexible attitude of Johann Martin Schleyer, the creator of Volap√ºk, himself, this led to several schisms in the Volap√ºk movement. As a result, a number of so-called \\"Volap√ºkids\\" emerged, most notably Idiom Neutral, first published in 1902, and Spokil. Spokil was created by Adolphe Charles Antoine Marie Nicolas (1833-?), a French ship's doctor from La Bourboule. A former partisan of Volap√ºk, he started working on Spokil in 1890 (though some sources mention 1887 instead). In 1904, he published a book about it: Spokil. Language internationale. Grammaire, exercise, les deux dictionnaires. At a conference in Paris, held in June 1907, Nicolas was allowed to defend his language in person; among the other languages discussed at the conference were Parla, Bolak (La Langue Bleue), Idiom Neutral, and Esperanto. At the same meeting, Ido was first presented. Spokil never gained much support, however, and nowadays is largely forgotten. Like Volap√ºk, Spokil is most often qualified as an a priori/a posteriori hybrid. Some authors, including Nicolas himself, consider it a purely a priori language.

In the 19th century steps were made to allow pedestrians up to the top of the tor and a metal handrail fixed to allow tourists easier access to the summit. This was not entirely welcomed and in 1851, a Dr Croker complained about the rock steps that had been cut \\"to enable the enervated and pinguedinous scions of humanity of this wonderful nineteenth century to gain the summit\\".Quoted in Hemery 1983, p. 693. According to the OED the word pinguedinous means \\"of the nature of or resembling fat; fatty, greasy.\\" The handrail was removed in the 1960s due to it rusting: the stumps of the uprights are still embedded in the rock.Hemery 1983, p. 693 A typical distant view of Haytor as seen from the left In 1953, Haytor was used as a major location for the feature film Knights of the Round Table starring Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner. An \\"elaborate and impressive castle\\" was built between the two main rock piles of the tor and traditional medieval sports, including jousting, were staged here for the film. The whole of Haytor Down was sold to the newly formed Dartmoor National Park Authority in 1974. Geology Haytor has the form of a typical \\"avenue\\" tor, where the granite between the two main outcrops has been eroded away. Its characteristic shape is a notable landmark visible on the skyline from many places in south Devon between Exeter and Totnes. The majority of the tor consists of coarse-grained granite, but at the base of the western outcrop is a layer of finer-grained granite which has eroded more than the rock above, leaving a pronounced overhang (a rock shelter) of two or three feet in places.Perkins 1972, pp. 93‚Äì5 Haytorite, a variety of quartz found in an iron mine adjacent to the Hay Tor granite quarries, was named ‚Äúin honour of its birth-place‚Äù.Tripe, Cornelius: Observations on a Mineral from near Hay Tor, in Devonshire in: The Philosophical Magazine, or Annals of Chemistry, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural History, and General Science Vol. I., London 1827, p. 38 Google Books Quarrying right The granite below the tor has fewer large feldspar crystals than at the tor itself, and this was preferred for building. There are several quarries on the northern slopes of Haytor down which were worked intermittently between 1820 and 1919. Between 1820 and 1858 the rock from these quarries was transported by the Haytor Granite Tramway to the Stover Canal. The tramway itself was built out of the granite it would carry, and due to its durable nature much of it remains visible today. Haytor granite was used in the reconstruction of London Bridge which opened in 1831 and was moved in 1970 to Lake Havasu City in Arizona.Perkins 1972, pp. 112‚Äì4 The last rock quarried here in 1919 was used for the Exeter war memorial. Today Haytor rocks and quarries are protected from development and disturbance as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The area is considered a natural beauty spot and is arguably Dartmoor's most famous landmark, visited by coach parties and walking groups. It is accessible by road and at a height of right on the eastern side of the moor, it provides views of the coastline, the Teign Estuary and the rolling countryside between, with the ridge of Haldon behind. In 2013, Simon Jenkins rated the view from Haytor as one of the top ten in England. The smaller, western outcrop is sometimes known as \\"Lowman\\". Rock climbers make use of both outcrops; each has routes of varying difficulty. The road that passes below the tor hosted a summit finish on Stage 6 of the 2013 Tour of Britain, and the climb was again used for the finish of the sixth stage of the 2016 Tour of Britain.

It is located between the towns of Virginia and Bailieborough. Civil parish Killinkere gave its name to an Irish civil parish and was located mainly in the barony of Castlerahan, but partly in the barony of Upper Loughtee, all in County Cavan in the Province of Ulster. The Civil Parish of Killinkere was used for local taxation and was shown on the nineteenth century Ordnance Survey of Ireland maps. For poor law purposes the Civil Parish was replaced by District Electoral Divisions in the mid- nineteenth century. According to the 1851 census the Civil Parish had a total of 49 townlands. Ecclesiastical parishes =Church of Ireland parish= Killinkere Parish Church, Killinkere. Killinkere Parish Church, Beagh Glebe, Killinkere, was built in 1817. It is the oldest of the churches in the Virginia Group of Parishes in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The other churches in the group are Lurgan Parish Church in Virginia (built 1821), Munterconnaught Parish Church (built 1831), and Billis Church (built 1844). The four churches were amalgamated under one incumbency in 1972. =Roman Catholic parish= The Roman Catholic Parish of Killinkere has two places of worship. They are two of a number churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore. St Ultan's Church, Corratinner, Killinkere, has the oldest history. The original church was in the townland of Gallon, about from the present church, and was part of a monastic settlement, dating from the 14th to the 16th century. The site was abandoned sometime between 1590 and 1641. During the penal times, Killinkere had no Roman Catholic place of worship. In 1790, a mud-thatched hut was erected in Killinkere, and in 1829 work on the present church began, which was completed by Christmas Day 1829. There have been a number of notable renovations in the interior during the 1920s, the 1960s and the 1990s. St Mary's Church, Clanaphilip, Termon, Killinkere, was shown as a ruin on a map in 1690. It was replaced a number of times, first as a mud wall church at Termon Cross in 1785, then a thatched building in 1810, and a barn-type church in 1870. Work on the present church began in 1973 and was blessed and opened in 1974. It incorporates the bell, baptismal font, the 1810 date-stone and the altar bell from the earlier buildings. The church was re-roofed and extensively renovated in 1992.

His achievements include several collaborations with well-known musicians, two bronze sculptures displayed in Switzerland and numerous books. Chronology Woodroffe was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, in 1940, the son of an electrical engineer.*Woodroffe, Patrick (1986), 1986 A Closer Look (at the art and techniques of Patrick Woodroffe) Published by Paper Tiger In 1964 he graduated in French and German at the University of Leeds, before going on to exhibit his first showing of pen and ink drawings, Conflict, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. However he did not become a full-time artist until 1972, the year in which he gave an exhibit of his paintings, etchings and related works at the Covent Garden Gallery in London.*Woodroffe, Patrick (1986), 1986 A Closer Look (at the art and techniques of Patrick Woodroffe) Published by Paper Tiger His career took off when he was asked to produce approximately 90 book cover paintings between 1973 and 1976 for Corgi, including Peter Valentine Timlett's The Seedbearers (1975) and Roger Zelazny's Nine Princes in Amber (1974). During this early period he was also commissioned to provide art for record album cover sleeves, including heavy metal band Judas Priest's album Sad Wings of Destiny (1976). This was followed by an exhibition of book-jacket and record-sleeve paintings in 1976, which appeared at Mel Calman's Workshop Gallery in London. That year the children's book Micky's New Home was published with illustrations by Woodroffe. In 1978 he mounted an exhibition of more than two hundred works at the historic Piece Hall in Halifax.*Woodroffe, Patrick (1986), 1986 A Closer Look (at the art and techniques of Patrick Woodroffe) Published by Paper Tiger In 1979, Woodroffe then went on to create illustrations for The Pentateuch of the Cosmogony: The Birth and Death of a World (later shortened to 'The Pentateuch'), a joint project the symphonic rock musician Dave Greenslade. The Pentateuch purports to be the first five chapters of an alien Book of Genesis. The album consisted of two-discs by Greenslade, and a 47-page book of Woodroffe's illustrations. The record sold over 50,000 copies between 1979 and 1984.http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/13Prog_Cover_Artist_Patrick_Woodroffe_Dead_At_74.shtml The illustrations were shown at the World Science Fiction Convention, at Brighton's Metropole Hotel in 1979.

In 1989 he prepared for conceptual art used in the film The NeverEnding Story II. Through the 1990s and 2000s he continued to work on numerous other projects including a sculpture at Gruyeres Castle in Switzerland, based on his earlier picture The Vicious Circle (1979). The project is designed to show war as a closed circle of absurd, self- destructive futility. He continued to hold exhibitions, his latest work including a recent exhibition at Sainte Barbe, in Switzerland.

The method requires applying a barrier layer of liquin to the drawing or etching. This layer must be allowed to dry thoroughly before the oil colour is applied in thin glazes. =Tomographs= Woodroffe's work also includes Tomographs (not to be confused with the medical scan - according to his book A Closer Look Woodroffe believed he had 'invented' the word in the seventies from the Greek words for 'cut' and 'drawing', until he found out about the medical usage). These are photographs that combine actual objects with cut-outs of his paintings (for example in one Tomograph Patrick is seen 'feeding' a cut-out picture of an anthropomorphic bird peanuts from his hand). The picture on the front of his project The Forget-me-not-Gardener is a Tomograph.

Coat of arms of the prince-bishopric Lavant In 1859 the episcopal see was re-assigned to Maribor (Marburg an der Drau) in present-day Slovenia, while the Carinthian parishes passed to the Diocese of Gurk. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Maribor (Marburg, in Slovenia) was later separated from the Salzburg ecclesiastical province and became a suffragan of the Archbishop of Ljubljana on 5 March 1962, with which the title of Bishop of Lavant was united. On 7 April 2006 the diocese was elevated to the Archdiocese of Maribor. While the bishops of Lavant bore the title of prince-bishops (German:F√ºrstbischof), this was purely honorary and they never became full-fledged prince-bishops with secular power over a self-ruling prince-bishopric (Hochstift), unlike the majority of the bishops in the Holy Roman Empire. They only exercised pastoral authority over their diocese like other ordinary bishops and for that reason, they did not have seat and vote in the Imperial Diet.  History  The original seat of the bishopric lay in the eastern part of Carinthia in the valley of the Lavant River. It was here, in the parish of Sankt Andr√§, that Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg had established, on 20 August 1212, with the consent of Pope Innocent III and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, a collegiate chapter, the regular canons of which followed the Rule of St. Augustine; its members were chosen from the cathedral chapter of Salzburg. On account of the great remoteness and the difficulty of travelling, the Salzburg Archbishop, about the year 1223, asked Pope Honorius III to allow him to found a bishopric at Sankt Andr√§. After the pope had had the archbishop's request examined by commissioners, and had given his consent, Eberhard drew up the deed of foundation, on 10 May 1228, wherein he secured the possession of the episcopal chair for himself and his successors in perpetuity. He named as first suffragan bishop his court chaplain Ulrich (died 1257), who had formerly been priest of Haus im Ennstal, in the Duchy of Styria. Catholic dioceses in present-day Austria about 1300 In the deed of foundation of the new bishopric, no exact boundaries were defined. In a deed of Archbishop Frederick II of Salzburg of 1280, seventeen parishes, situated partly in Carinthia and partly in Styria, were described as belonging to Lavant; the extent of the diocese was rather small, but the bishops also attended to the office of vicar-general (diocesan deputy) of the Archbishops of Salzburg for some scattered districts; they also frequently attended to the office of Vicedominus (bishop's feudal deputy in secular affairs) at Friesach. The tenth bishop, Dietrich von Wolfsau (1318‚Äì32), is mentioned in deeds as the first (honorific) prince-bishop; he was also secretary of the Habsburg duke Frederick the Handsome, and was present at the Battle of M√ºhldorf in 1322. Since the twenty-second bishop, Theobald Schweinbeck (1446‚Äì63), the bishops have borne without intermission the title of F√ºrst (prince). The following prominent bishops deserve special mention: the humanist Johann I von Rott (1468‚Äì82), died as Prince-Bishop of Breslau; Georg II Agrikola (1570‚Äì84), who after 1572 was also at the same time Bishop of Seckau; Georg III Stob√§us von Palmburg (1584‚Äì1618), a worthy promotor of the Counter-Reformation; Maximilian Gandolph Freiherr von Kienburg (1654‚Äì65), did much towards increasing the financial resources of the diocese. By the new regulations under Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, several territories were added to the Diocese of Lavant. Prince-Archbishop Michael Brigido of Laibach in 1788 ceded a number of parishes in the southern part of what is now the Diocese of Lavant the Diocese of Gurk; and the district of V√∂lkermarkt, which was afterwards again detached, was added to the bishopric at that time. The extent of the diocese was changed by the circumscription of 1 June 1859. The valley of the Lavant and the district of V√∂lkermarkt in Carinthia fell to the Diocese of Gurk; in consequence of which the District of Marburg was transferred from Seckau to Lavant; since then the diocese comprises the whole of southern Styria. By the decree of the Congregation of the Consistory of 20 May 1857, the see of the bishop was removed from St. Andr√§ to Marburg; the parish church of St. John the Baptist in that place being elevated into a cathedral, and the title \\"of Lavant\\" being preserved. On 4 September 1859, Bishop Anton Martin Slom≈°ek (1846‚Äì62) made his solemn entry into Marburg. His successors, Jakob Maximilian Stepischnegg (1862‚Äì89), and Michael Napotnik (since 1889) have shown great zeal for the promotion of the spiritual life by introducing religious orders and founding educational and charitable institutions and clubs. But the most beneficial work done for the religious life of the diocese was that of the diocesan synods, held by Stepischnegg (1883), and by Napotnik, who followed his example (1896, 1900, 1903, and 1906). The old cathedral chapter, which was composed of the canons of the Augustinian order, was dissolved in 1808, and its property was assigned to the \\"Religionsfond\\" founded by Joseph II; in 1825 a new cathedral chapter was provisionally erected, and definitively so in 1847. The most prominent ecclesiastical buildings in the diocese are: the cathedral and parish church of St. John the Baptist, at Marburg, which was begun in the middle of the twelfth century as a Romanesque basilica, rebuilt after 1520 in the Gothic style, again restored after the fire in 1601, and once more in 1885; the provostship and parish church of St. Georg, at Pettau, erected in the Gothic style about 1314; the abbey and parish church of St. Daniel, at Cilli, dates from the middle of the sixteenth century; and the shrine of St. Maria der W√ºste, in the neighbourhood of Marburg (built 1628), in the baroque style.  Present statistics  In 2004, the diocese of Maribor had 704,384 Catholics of 826,229 people (= 85.3% of inhabitants), 311 diocesan and 93 regular priests, 4 permanent deacons, 109 male 134? and 290 female members of religious orders. On April 7, 2006 Pope Benedict XVI elevated the diocese to an archdiocese with the new suffragan dioceses of Celje and Murska Sobota.

It is also the name of the housing development built on the heathland in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The area is split into 2 wards, and at the 2011 census, the combined population of the 2 wards was 14,079.  History  Historically, Canford Heath was part of the Canford Estate; in the Domesday Book, the manor of Cheneford was held by Edward of Salisbury. Canford Heath was common land. In 1810, it was subdivided among Poole's Proprietors, in response to the 1805 Enclosure Act, which \\"enabled the enclosure of over 9000 acres of ‚ÄòCommon Meadows, Heaths, Waste Lands and Commonable Grounds‚Äô\\". In the early 20th century, Canford Heath had many different uses. In 1929, Canford Heath staged a hillclimb event for the \\"Motorcycle and Light Car Club\\", and during the Second World War, Canford Heath was used as a munitions storage. In 1938, most of the heathland was destroyed by a series of massive fires. In 1944, it was suggested that Canford Heath should be \\"preserved from business development\\" after the War, although in 1946, a plan was issued by Professor Abercrombie, which suggested the use of Canford Heath as a housing development, in preference to building in the New Forest. In 1947, there was another large heathfire. Building work began on a housing development in 1963 in South Canford Heath, whilst Parkstone and Poole grammar schools were relocated to the edge of the heath in 1962 and 1968 respectively, and the first Combined school opened in Canford Heath in 1970. The first Supermarket on the Heath was Waitrose, which opened in June 1970 sharing its car park with the also recently opened Fighter Pilot (now The Pilot) public house and Canford Heath United Reformed Church. Waitrose closed in 1982 to be replaced by Kwik Save. The current supermarket at Adastral Square is Iceland. Housing development began in 1973 in North Canford Heath, and in 1980, International Supermarket and formerly Somerfield (now Asda) became North Canford Heath's first supermarket. In 1984, planning permission was given for development of all of Canford Heath, providing that the site did not become a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). In response, an application was made in 1985 for much of Canford Heath to become a SSSI, due to the rare habitat and wildlife on the heathland. The application was accepted in 1988, although developers were still permitted to build houses on land not in the SSSI. A report by the Conservation Committee of the British Herpetological Society to the House of Lords in 1988 said that \\"more than half of Canford, our largest single heath, is being built over with most of its reptiles doomed or already lost\\", and a 1988 New Scientist article criticised that houses could be built as little as 50 metres away from the SSSI, continuing to endanger rare reptiles. In 1991, then Secretary of State Michael Heseltine revoked planning consent for development on all of Canford Heath. In 2008, planning permission was given to develop homes on a former landfill site not in the SSSI. In 2006, a heathfire caused by arson caused around 100 people to be evacuated from their homes, and required around 170 firefighters to put out. Around 34-45 hectares of heathland was destroyed. In 2015, another fire damaged 2 hectares of heathland, and required 70 firefighters; the damage caused could take 15‚Äì25 years to repair. There is also a bunker located on the heath that no one seems to know any history about it.  Heathland  Canford Heath is Dorset's largest heathland, and much of it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and part of the Dorset Heathlands Special Protection Area. Canford Heath is the largest lowland heath in the United Kingdom, and is home to many rare species, including the smooth snake, sand lizard and dartford warbler. To maintain the heathland and its unique wildlife a 10-year management plan was introduced in 2010. In 2009, an episode of Springwatch was filmed at Canford Heath's Hatchpond. Geography Canford Heath has grown its own community life with two public houses (The Haymoor & The Pilot), a selection of churches, an ASDA supermarket, five schools and a range of social activities for young people. The Tower Park leisure complex is nearby. Schools In September 2013, Poole Council changed its Age of Transfer, adopting the primary school system in favour of the previous middle school system. As such, all First and middle schools became infant and junior schools. There are two infant schools in Canford Heath (Ad Astra Infant School and Canford Heath Infant School), two junior schools (Haymoor Junior School and Canford Heath Junior School) and two secondary schools (Magna Academy and Poole Grammar School). Poole Grammar School is a selective all-male school. There is also a special educational needs school (Longspee School & Service).  Politics  For the purpose of local elections, Canford Heath comprises two wards, Canford Heath East and Canford Heath West, each of which elect 2 councillors. At the 2015 council election, Canford Heath East elected two Liberal Democrat councillors, and Canford Heath West elected two Conservative councillors. Poole's Mayor for the civic year 2018-19is Cllr Sean Gabriel who represents the Canford Heath West Ward. For the purposes of national elections, since 1997 Canford Heath has been part of the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency; previously it was part of the Poole constituency. The current MP is Michael Tomlinson, who won the seat in 2015.

Jens Hansen Gold and Silversmith in Nelson, New Zealand, made the trophy by hand. The same workshop made the gold ring in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Three different silversmiths constructed the trophy. This required soldering together a number of silver sheets as well as sanding, buffing and polishing. The trophy is 49 cm high and weighs 2.7 kg. The trophy was unveiled in Wellington for the first time on Tuesday, 7 February 2006. The public was able to view the trophy for the first time on 10 February when the Blues played the Hurricanes in the Super 14's opening match in Auckland. The 2006 Super 14 season was the first season that the trophy was used. 389x389px The trophy has the Super 14 logo on a globe, on a four-sided twisted spiral. Fraser Holland, the New Zealand Rugby Union sponsorship and marketing manager, oversaw the construction of the trophy. He said that the SANZAR unions were happy to have a new trophy to launch the expanded competition. :\\"We also wanted to move away from the traditional cup-style trophy and have a dynamic trophy to reflect the spirit of the Super 14. I think the designers have certainly achieved that - it's a superbly crafted, iconic trophy with a definite international look about it,\\" Holland said. The Super Rugby trophy, the trophy is a rotating trophy, held only during the offseason and returned to the competition organisers in time for it to be awarded to the next season's champions. The trophy was first awarded to the Crusaders after winning the 2006 Super 14 Final. On 30 June 2011, SANZAR unveiled the new trophy that will be presented to the winners of the Super Rugby final scheduled for Saturday, 9 July 2011. The trophy, which will be in use from 2011 and beyond, was crafted from solid stainless steel and polished to a mirror finish. It has a height of 65 cm and a mass of 18 kilograms. The trophy was designed by the company responsible for the 2000 Olympic Torch, Blue Sky Design of Sydney. The trophy was manufactured by Box and Dice Pty Ltd also based in Sydney. SANZAR CEO, Greg Peters, said \\"The shape of the trophy is centred around three curved legs, each representing the Conferences involved in the Super Rugby competition.\\" According to Peters, \\"The champions trophy is the 'big one', and will become the ultimate symbol of Super Rugby supremacy in the years to come.\\" The colour on each leg corresponds to the Conferences with gold for Australia, black for New Zealand, and green for South Africa. The Reds of Australia, the Stormers of South Africa and the Crusaders of New Zealand were the winners of their respective conferences and were each presented with a scaled-down copy of the trophy.

Cricket career Bolton was a right-handed opening batsman and a useful leg-spin bowler who played for almost 10 years for Canterbury in New Zealand domestic cricket and then, after a year's break, for a further five seasons for Wellington. Up to 1958, Bolton had an undistinguished batting record in first-class cricket, but in Canterbury's first two matches of the 1958‚Äì59 Plunket Shield season he made 79, 29, 74 and 49, top-scoring for Canterbury three times. He was brought into the New Zealand cricket team for the two Tests against the touring England team at the end of the season. In the first match, which New Zealand lost by an innings, Bolton did well, scoring 33 in the first innings, when he was sixth man out after more than three hours at the crease, and 26 in the second innings. In his second Test, he was run out for 0 in a match that was ended after two days because of rain. He did not bowl in either of his two Tests.Wisden 1960, pp. 847‚Äì51. Bolton's one first-class century came the following season, with 138 against Northern Districts, when he shared a first- wicket stand of 214 with future Test captain Graham Dowling. His career best bowling came two seasons later, in 1961‚Äì62, with 7‚Äì23 against Central Districts, in a season when he took only eight wickets in all matches. For Wellington later in his career he batted further down the order and in 1969‚Äì70 he captained the side.

Domestic career A stocky, fair- haired, off-spinning all-rounder, Sparling was educated at Auckland Grammar School. Coached in Auckland by Jim Laker, he broke into the Auckland team at the age of 18. He continued to play for Auckland until 1970‚Äì71. His most successful season with the bat was 1959‚Äì60, when he made 705 runs at an average of 37.10. In the Plunket Shield match against Canterbury that season he scored 105 and 51 and took 7 for 98 and 2 for 13. His most successful season with the ball was 1964‚Äì65, when he took 38 wickets at an average of 15.50,Bowling by season but by then, although Sparling was still only 26, the selectors had turned to the younger spin-bowling all-rounders Bryan Yuile, Vic Pollard and Ross Morgan. His career-best figures that year, 7 for 49 for Auckland against Otago, took Auckland to a narrow victory.Auckland v Otago, 1964‚Äì65 He captained Auckland through most of the 1960s, leading the team to two Plunket Shield titles. International career Sparling was the youngest member of the New Zealand cricket team that toured England in 1958. On a tour where New Zealand were badly outclassed and in a summer where the weather was almost uniformly dismal, Sparling was one of the few players to emerge with an enhanced reputation. Wisden called him the player with \\"undoubtedly most promise\\" and wrote: \\"A natural cricketer, he should come to the fore with so many years ahead of him.\\"Wisden 1959, p. 227. In fact, Sparling's figures for the tour were fairly modest: 513 runs at an average of less than 18 runs per innings and 38 wickets at just over 20 runs a wicket. He played in the last three of the five Tests and his 50 at Old Trafford on his 20th birthday was one of only three 50s scored by the Test side all summer. His stand of 61 for the seventh wicket with Eric Petrie in this match was the highest stand for New Zealand in the whole series.Wisden 1959, pp. 229‚Äì67. Predictions of an illustrious Test career were, however, wide of the mark. Sparling played twice against the touring English side in 1958‚Äì59, three times on the New Zealand tour of South Africa in 1961‚Äì62, once against England in New Zealand in 1962‚Äì63 and twice in the home series against South Africa in 1963‚Äì64. In none of these matches did Sparling reach 50 as a batsman and in none of them did he take more than one wicket in an innings. He played in all four of the matches New Zealand played against the visiting Australian team in 1959‚Äì60, scoring two fifties and taking six wickets, but they were not Test matches.Wisden 1961, pp. 848‚Äì53. At Auckland in the New Zealand v England Test match in February 1963, Sparling bowled an 11-ball over when the umpire, Dick Shortt, lost count of the number of balls Sparling had bowled.The XI worst overs Retrieved 4 November 2012 See also * List of Auckland representative cricketers References External links * John Sparling at Cricket Archive * John Sparling at Cricinfo * \\"Last Over with Erin: John Sparling\\" from the New Zealand Cricket Museum 1938 births Living people People educated at Auckland Grammar School New Zealand Test cricketers New Zealand cricketers Auckland cricketers People from Mount Eden ","title":"John Sparling"},{"id":"4013456","text":"Saint Iuventius (or Iuvence) was a bishop of Pavia during the 1st century.

Captain America and Santo vs. Spider-Man; (√ú√ß Dev Adam) is a 1973 Turkish cult superhero film, directed by T. Fikret U√ßak and written by Doƒüan Tamer based on the characters created by Steve Ditko, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Joe Simon and Rodolfo Guzm√°n Huerta, featuring Aytekin Akkaya as Captain America and Yavuz Selekman as Santo called to Istanbul on a special mission to stop the villainous Spider-Man and his criminal gang. The film, which went on nationwide general release across the country on , was completely unauthorized by the copyright owners of the characters depicted. The film was popular and thus spawned other rip-offs of other major Hollywood productions. Plot The story takes place in Istanbul, where a violent criminal organization led by Spider-Man surfaces in the city with counterfeit United States dollars. They also decapitate a woman via a boat propeller. A small task-force consisting of Captain America, Santo and Captain America's girlfriend, Julia arrives to help local police stop Spider-Man and his gang. Julia, who has infiltrated Spider- Man's hideout, is captured and taken to a house in a remote location. She manages to send an SOS signal to the Captain. Captain America saves Julia and chases after Spider-Man, who manages to escape. Meanwhile, Mexico's national superhero/wrestler, Santo, infiltrates the dojo that is used as a front for counterfeiting. After being captured, he manages to escape along with incriminating evidence. Captain and Santo raid a very important hideout where most of the counterfeiting operation is taking place. They manage to shut down the hideout while Spider-Man kills a couple, steals a statue and runs away. Soon afterwards, another fight between heroes and Spider-Man begins. It is revealed that there are four Spider-Men as one is beaten to a pulp by Santo and another is strangled to death by Captain America. Captain America and Santo then go undercover in a club. Spider-Man's gang notice them and a fight occurs. The heroes are seemingly overpowered this time and are taken to Spider-Man's hideout. Once there Captain America and Santo act like they are fighting themselves to confuse their captors but manage to break out and eliminate most of the gang members. Spider-Man arrives at the end of the fight with his girlfriend, only to have her struck by a wild shot from the gun of one of his henchmen. He flees, with Captain America in hot pursuit. Captain America catches Spider-Man and defeats him, only to hear the taunting laugh of yet another Spider-Man. The fight continues until all of the Spider-Men are dead. As the heroes are about to leave Istanbul, Captain America sees the face of Spider-Man in a taxi and furiously runs and removes the mask of the person in the car, only to realize that it was just a child wearing a wrestling mask. Cast * Yavuz Selekman as Santo. The primary difference between this version of El Santo and the original is that the character in the film wears a wrestling mask only briefly, whereas the real-life Santo was never seen in public without one.

He doesn't have his shield and his mask lacks the wings on the side of his head. * Tevfik ≈ûen as Spider-Man. He is depicted as a villain, with none of his abilities from the comics.

This is done by manually generating packets to test network devices and behaviour, instead of using existing network traffic. Testing may target the firewall, IDS, TCP/IP stack, router or any other component of the network. Packets are usually created by using a packet generator or packet analyzer which allows for specific options and flags to be set on the created packets. The act of packet crafting can be broken into four stages: Packet Assembly, Packet Editing, Packet Play and Packet Decoding. Tools exist for each of the stages - some tools are focused only on one stage while others such as Ostinato try to encompass all stages. Packet assembly Packet Assembly is the creation of the packets to be sent. Some popular programs used for packet assembly are Hping, Nemesis, Ostinato, Cat Karat packet builder, Libcrafter, libtins, PcapPlusPlus, Scapy, Wirefloss and Yersinia. Packets may be of any protocol and are designed to test specific rules or situations. For example, a TCP packet may be created with a set of erroneous flags to ensure that the target machine sends a RESET command or that the firewall blocks any response. Packet editing Packet Editing is the modification of created or captured packets. This involves modifying packets in manners which are difficult or impossible to do in the Packet Assembly stage, such as modifying the payload of a packet. Programs such as Scapy, Ostinato, Netdude allow a user to modify recorded packets' fields, checksums and payloads quite easily. These modified packets can be saved in packet streams which may be stored in pcap files to be replayed later. Packet play Packet Play or Packet Replay is the act of sending a pre-generated or captured series of packets. Packets may come from Packet Assembly and Editing or from captured network attacks. This allows for testing of a given usage or attack scenario for the targeted network. Tcpreplay is the most common program for this task since it is capable of taking a stored packet stream in the pcap format and sending those packets at the original rate or a user-defined rate. Scapy also supports send functions to replay any saved packets/pcap. Ostinato added support for pcap files in version 0.4. Some packet analyzers are also capable of packet replay. Packet decoding Packet Decoding is the capture and analysis of the network traffic generated during Packet Play. In order to determine the targeted network's response to the scenario created by Packet Play, the response must be captured by a packet analyzer and decoded according to the appropriate specifications. Depending on the packets sent, a desired response may be no packets were returned or that a connection was successfully established, among others. The most famous tools for that task are Wireshark and Scapy.

It is part of Lika.  Geography  Pla≈°ki is situated in the lower part of the Ogulin-Pla≈°ki valley. Together with Gorski kotar and Lika, the Ogulin-Pla≈°ki valley forms Mountainous Croatia. The town of Pla≈°ki is situated 28 km south from Ogulin and shares borders with municipalities of Ogulin, Josipdol and Saborsko.

Roman coins have been found in Pla≈°ki which proves that this region was inhabited in Roman times. The name Pla≈°ki was first mentioned in 1163 in documents of the Split diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The second mention dates from 1185 and relates to the establishment of new Krbava diocese, which the parish of Pla≈°ki became a part of. Pla≈°ki county (Comitatus Plazy) was a separate administrative region until 1193, when it became part of Modru≈° county and came to be owned by the Frankopan family. In the name of Frankopans Pla≈°ki was governed by the Zebiƒá family of nobles, who were their loyal vassals (even today a part of Pla≈°ki is called Zebiƒái). In 1492 just before the Battle of Krbava Pla≈°ki was raided by the Turks led by Jakub-Pa≈°a and Pla≈°ki was abandoned. In a document of Bernardin Frankopan from 1500 Pla≈°ki is described as defense fort against the Turks. Another document from 1550 confirms Pla≈°ki's status as defense fort and also mentions it as one of four centres in the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Empire. By decision of the Military Council in Graz, Serbs were allowed to resettle the area. The Serbs came in three waves: 1609, 1639 and 1666. Together with Tounj, Pla≈°ki was centre of a military company that was part of Ogulin's regiment. The Eparchy of Upper Karlovac of the Serbian Orthodox Church was founded in 1711 and had its first seat in Gomirje monastery and from 1721 to 1941 the seat was in Pla≈°ki. The Orthodox Cathedral was built from 1756 to 1763.  Demographics  Before the Croatian War of Independence, Pla≈°ki was a municipality with a majority of Serb population. In the census of 2001, the town of Pla≈°ki had 1,468 with total municipality population of 2,292,http://www.dzs.hr/hrv/censuses/census2001/Popis/H01_01_03/h01_01_03_zup04-3336.html of which 48.4% were Croats, and 46.1% Serbs. Much of the Croat population is made up of those forced to leave Bosnia replacing Serbs who, in 1995, fled during the war Operation Storm.

She was a young widow when she heard of the holy man, Francis of Assisi. Desiring to meet the penitent in order to seek his spiritual advice, she got her wish when Francis and his small band came to Rome to obtain papal approval of the Franciscan Rule of life.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F..M.), Franciscan Media Having heard Francis preach, she sought his guidance on how to be charitable. Francis advised her not to abandon her family, so she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis, turning administration of the affairs over to her two sons. She spent the rest of her life in the practice of good works. When he travelled to Rome, Francis would stay as her guest. She gave some of her family's property in Trastevere, Rome to Francis and the brothers to use as a hospice for lepers and she provided for their needs. Francis and Lady Jacoba became friends.

Hazelwood Park is a park in the Australian state of South Australia located in the suburb of Hazelwood Park within the Adelaide Metropolitan Area. First creek continues its journey from the hills through the park, the water flowing from Waterfall Gully and into Tusmore. The park contains an assortment of play areas, picnic tables and barbecues. It is relatively large by suburban standards, but unusually there are no playing fields. It is strongly characterised by massive old eucalyptus trees that can be seen from blocks away. Although it is well facilitated, it is normally not as popular as the nearby smaller Tusmore Park. Hazelwood Park was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 11 May 1995. George Bolton Swimming Centre thumbThe park also contains the George Bolton Swimming Centre, sometimes referred to as the Burnside Swimming Centre, or just Burnside Pool, comprising an outdoor lap pool, a children's pool and a wading pool. There is also a sauna and steam room, two playgrounds and a kiosk. The facility is only open in the summer months, and is very popular on hot days in Adelaide (greater than 32 ¬∞C) when it is open until late in the evening. =History= The Burnside Swimming Centre is a large swimming complex in the park, opened in 1966. The swimming centre was a pet project of then-Mayor George Bolton; he had a grand vision of what he wanted Hazelwood Park to become. Bolton met unprecedented public opposition in 1964 when the idea was first unveiled. The substantial elderly population of Burnside (15%) was wholly opposed to the idea, suggesting the influx of troublemakers and noise was hardly worth the effort. The cost was estimated at ¬£75,000. While architects were resigning over the scale of the proposed development and a number of residents were up in arms, the Adelaide newspapers had a ball; cartoonists spent many of their daily cartoons covering the debacle. With the failure of a poll to decide the fate of the idea on 24 March 1964, the Sunday Mail proclaimed the headline \\"Burnside Says NO to Swim Pool\\". Mayor Bolton was not dismayed by the result; he pushed further ahead with his idea, announcing new plans in December 1964. After a strong PR campaign and minor changes to the project, a poll in February 1965 voted strongly in favour of the idea. The Mayor had won his battle and it was named the George Bolton Swimming Centre in his honour upon opening in 1966.

Named after Joseph Barry, a well known merchant of the 19th century it is situated at the northern end of the Tradouw's pass which winds its way through the mountains to Swellendam. History Barrydale's history dates back to the early 18th century when farmers moved into the area looking for fertile arable land with water. The community built their church on a spot where the R62 and R324 roads meet. In the days before the church was built there were a number of nagmaal houses (houses where Holy Communion could be celebrated) and a school, but not much else. The Dutch Reformed Community of Barrydale came into being in 1878 when land was purchased to build the church. As the farmers in the area were encouraged to plant vineyards and orchards, it was natural that a winery and distillery would eventually be built. In 1940 the Barrydale Ko√∂peratiewe Wynkelder was formed and a distillery established giving rise to the wine industry in the area. Joseph Barry Brandy, produced locally, was voted best brandy in the world in 2003. Over the years the village grew and eventually a municipality was established in 1921. Today there is an estimated population of ~4100 permanent residents. The population increases dramatically in the tourist season, with visitors drawn by arts and crafts displays including textiles, jewellery and African souvenirs. Climate Barrydale has a temperate climate of warm, dry summers with averages of 25¬∞C occasionally up to 35¬∞C, and mild, wet winters when the temperature occasionally dips to around -1¬∞C accompanied by light frosts. The warm temperate climate is perfect for the growth of various fruit trees with numerous orchards on the fertile soils of the Tradouw Valley. Apples, pears and oranges are harvested in the winter and crops of apricots, figs, cling peaches and grapes in the summer. Culture The town still shows the legacy of the apartheid era when it was divided in two to separate whites from non-whites, a large proportion of which are direct descendants of the indigenous Khoisan tribe. Barrydale is culturally diverse for a small village with English- and Afrikaans-speaking inhabitants as well as a substantial European expatriate community including French, German, Spanish and Italian residents. The annual Barrydale Spring Festival in October is an important event on the town's calendar. The Joseph Barry Tradouw Pass Half Marathon attracts a large number of runners who compete over a 21 km course through the pass. Flora and fauna Grootvadersbosch N.R. Barrydale and the surrounding area is rich in species diversity with abundant wildlife such as baboons, genets, mongooses, klipspringer (small khaki-coloured antelope often seen perched on rocks), and rock hyraxes, known locally as dassies (smaller relatives of the elephant). More elusive animals, such as porcupines, aardvarks, jackals, otters and the reclusive leopards, are occasionally seen in the mountains. Reptiles are common, especially snakes, with a few poisonous species such as puff adder, boomslang (tree snake) and Cape cobra. The area is also home to numerous bird species such as the Cape eagle-owl, hadeda ibis, grey heron, sunbird (these often have iridescent plumage), fiscal shrike which impales its prey on acacia thorns or barbed wire, and black eagles often seen soaring high overhead on the thermals. The area has many rare plant species, notably the fynbos flora on the slopes of the Langeberg mountain range in the south, and succulent- dominated Karroid flora to the north. There are many private and state reserves in the area such as the Grootvadersbosch Nature Reserve. Churches in Barrydale Like in many other South African cities and villages there are church buildings of different denominations.

It was named in 1910 after a property name of another settler, WH McCormack. The name is believed to be derived from the eponymous area of west London. Within the suburb there is a primary school (Maida Vale Primary School), a golf course, numerous parks/ovals (including a Seventh Day Adventist church ground and caravan park), small shops including a BP Petrol station, and a heated swimming pool.

The idea was formulated by the logical positivists and arises out of a formalist vision of mathematics as pure symbol manipulation. Formalism In order to get a grasp on the motivations which inspired the development of the idea of coordinative definitions, it is important to understand the doctrine of formalism as it is conceived in the philosophy of mathematics. For the formalists, mathematics, and particularly geometry, is divided into two parts: the pure and the applied. The first part consists in an uninterpreted axiomatic system, or syntactic calculus, in which terms such as point, straight line and between (the so-called primitive terms) have their meanings assigned to them implicitly by the axioms in which they appear. On the basis of deductive rules eternally specified in advance, pure geometry provides a set of theorems derived in a purely logical manner from the axioms. This part of mathematics is therefore a priori but devoid of any empirical meaning, not synthetic in the sense of Kant. It is only by connecting these primitive terms and theorems with physical objects such as rulers or rays of light that, according to the formalist, pure mathematics becomes applied mathematics and assumes an empirical meaning. The method of correlating the abstract mathematical objects of the pure part of theories with physical objects consists in coordinative definitions. It was characteristic of logical positivism to consider a scientific theory to be nothing more than a set of sentences, subdivided into the class of theoretical sentences, the class of observational sentences, and the class of mixed sentences. The first class contains terms which refer to theoretical entities, that is to entities not directly observable such as electrons, atoms and molecules; the second class contains terms which denote quantities or observable entities, and the third class consists of precisely the coordinative definitions which contain both types of terms because they connect the theoretical terms with empirical procedures of measurement or with observable entities. For example, the interpretation of \\"the geodesic between two points\\" as correspondent to \\"the path of a light ray in a vacuum\\" provides a coordinative definition. This is very similar to, but distinct from an operational definition. The difference is that coordinative definitions do not necessarily define theoretical terms in terms of laboratory procedures or experimentation, as operationalism does, but may also define them in terms of observable or empirical entities. In any case, such definitions (also called bridge laws or correspondence rules) were held to serve three important purposes. In the first place, by connecting the uninterpreted formalism with the observation language, they permit the assignment of synthetic content to theories. In the second, according to whether they express a factual or a purely conventional content, they allow for the subdivision of science into two parts: one factual and independent of human conventions, the other non-empirical and conventional. This distinction is reminiscent of Kant's division of knowledge into content and form. Lastly, they allow for the possibility to avoid certain vicious circles that arise with regard to such matters as the measurement of the speed of light in one direction. As has been pointed out by John Norton with regard to Hans Reichenbach's arguments about the nature of geometry: on the one hand, we cannot know if there are universal forces until we know the true geometry of spacetime, but on the other, we cannot know the true geometry of spacetime until we know whether there are universal forces. Such a circle can be broken by way of coordinative definition.(Norton 1992). From the point of view of the logical empiricist, in fact, the question of the \\"true geometry\\" of spacetime does not arise, given that saving, e.g., Euclidean geometry by introducing universal forces which cause rulers to contract in certain directions, or postulating that such forces are equal to zero, does not mean saving the Euclidean geometry of actual space, but only changing the definitions of the corresponding terms. There are not really two incompatible theories to choose between, in the case of the true geometry of spacetime, for the empiricist (Euclidean geometry with universal forces not equal to zero, or non-Euclidean geometry with universal forces equal to zero), but only one theory formulated in two different ways, with different meanings to attribute to the fundamental terms on the basis of coordinative definitions. However, given that, according to formalism, interpreted or applied geometry does have empirical content, the problem is not resolved on the basis of purely conventionalist considerations and it is precisely the coordinative definitions, which bear the burden of finding the correspondences between mathematical and physical objects, which provide the basis for an empirical choice. Objection The problem is that coordinative definitions seem to beg the question. Since they are defined in conventional, non-empirical terms, it is difficult to see how they can resolve empirical questions. It would seem that the result of using coordinative definitions is simply to shift the problem of the geometric description of the world, for example, into a need to explain the mysterious \\"isomorphic coincidences\\" between the conventions given by the definitions and the structure of the physical world. Even in the simple case of defining \\"the geodesic between two points\\" as the empirical phrase \\"a ray of light in a vacuum\\", the correspondence between mathematical and empirical is left unexplained.

In 1827 the Colonial Botanist Charles Fraser and Captain James Stirling explored the region to evaluate its suitability for farming. Initially the area was used for forestry and orchards; fruit growing continues to be one of the major industries in Wattle Grove, Bickley and Orange Grove today. This suburb name may have come from a property that was in the area around 1920, or the name may have come about in the early 1900s from wattle trees that lined Welshpool Road; the district was described by the European settlers as \\"where the groves of wattle are\\". Much of Wattle Grove has developed into other agricultural uses such as poultry farms, equestrian studs, agistment paddocks, horticultural nurseries, pet kennels, hobby farms and cattle breeders. 20 residents of Wattle Grove were killed in action during World War One (1914‚Äì1919), 5 of whom were from the one family.

Symptomatic treatment is not always recommended, and in fact, it may be dangerous, because it may mask the presence of an underlying etiology which will then be forgotten or treated with great delay. Examples: * Low-grade fever for 15 days or more sometimes is the only symptom of bacteremia by staphylococcus bacteria. Suppressing it by symptomatic treatment will hide the disease from effective diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics. The consequence may be severe (rheumatic fever, nephritis, endocarditis, etc.) * Chronic headache may be caused simply by a constitutional disposition or be the result of a brain tumor or a brain aneurysm. Finally, symptomatic treatment is not exempt from adverse effects, and may be a cause of iatrogenic consequences (i.e., ill effects caused by the treatment itself), such as allergic reactions, stomach bleeding, central nervous system effects (nausea, dizziness, etc.).

About The school has four houses: Carpenter (green), Brunel (red), Grace (blue) and Muller (yellow), each named after a different famous person from Bristol. Students are sorted into these house somewhat at random, though some allowance is made for siblings and friendships. Each house has house captains, which can consist of four house captains or two house and two vice. Generally these are two girls and two boys. The house is shown via the tie that each student wears, which has three stripes repeating down it, one thin white stripe, one thick navy stripe and one medium stripe which is the house colour. There is also the school logo on the tie (a shield with small images representing the houses). In addition to the tie, the uniform consists of a navy blazer, the school logo situated on a pocket on the left. A white shirt is worn, along with dark grey tailored trousers and black leather shoes. There is also the option of wearing a dark grey skirt instead of trousers. Facilities The school is accessed through two sets of two gates, at the front and back of the school. Students, when entering and exiting the school, must pass through both gates. The exception to this is at the front gates, in which visitors (and late students) may enter through the reception, and the sixth form, which is entered by passing only through the first front gate. The reason for these double gates is so that the inner gates can be closed to keep students in, while visitors are still able to enter and exit through the outer gates. The school has several buildings. To the back and left it has PE (physical education) facilities, including a sports hall and several sports courts. This PE hall is run by the Circadian Trust. The school has a canteen in roughly the middle, and just behind it is a major classroom block, which includes maths, English and DT (design and technology). To the left of the canteen is the science labs, which is also situated behind the drama hall. The fire assembly point is behind the science block on another court. CSET Downend is part of an educational trust called Castle School Education Trust, named after Castle School. Sixth Form Downend and Mangotsfield share a sixth form, concentrated at the Downend School premises. The logo of this sixth Form is a 6 made up of various green shapes, including squares and a smaller 6. Students at this sixth form are mainly from Downend or Mangotsfield, though some come from other schools. The building is to the right of someone as they pass through the main school's front gate, and the entrance is just past the main school's secondary (side) gate. To enter this building, students must have a keycard, marked with their name and a picture of them, though knocking on the window of the reception immediately next to the entrance can occur if a student forgets their keycard. This card expires when the student leaves the school at the end of year 13. Inside the building there are eight smaller classrooms, as well as a more normal sized one. These are marked as P(number). One of these classrooms is a computer room, though the students also have access to laptops, available in the common room, which is to the left of the entrance and is by far the largest room in the building. This common room contains many chairs and tables, as well as leaflets for universities and the like, drawers for students, a kettle and a microwave. There is a whiteboard where announcements are written, and students are allowed to write there as well. A quote of the day, which is sometime serious and sometimes less so, is often written here. There are also toilets, and a few staff offices, and these are all the rooms. Most rooms have a lime green colour scheme. Lessons like maths and english generally take place within the sixth form building itself, while more specialised lessons, for example the sciences, take place within the main school. There is an exit at the back of the sixth form building into the main school, which does not require a key card. History =Page School for Girls= Staple Hill Senior School for Girls was established in 1933, and in 1947 became Staple Hill Secondary Modern School, having separate departments for boys and girls. After the Chase Comprehensive School had been built for the boys in about 1966, the girls stayed in the buildings in North View, and it was renamed Page School for Girls. =Establishment= In September 1982, Page School for Girls merged with the coeducational Stockwell Hill Comprehensive School, and the new school was called Downend Comprehensive School. =Later years= It was renamed Downend Community School. In 2005, it moved to Westerleigh Road. Tamryn Savage, was instated as head teacher for the school year beginning 2006 and onwards after the acting head teacher Ray Lockey retired.

Hutzler (1836‚Äì1927) in 1858. From its beginning as a small dry goods store at the corner of Howard and Clay Streets in downtown Baltimore, Hutzler's eventually grew into a chain of 10 department stores, all of which were located in Maryland. Early years alt=Moses Hutzler At age 23, Abram Hutzler was not yet old enough to secure credit; his father, Moses Hutzler, signed the official documents Abram needed to open the store in July 1858. Although the store originally traded as M. Hutzler & Son, Moses Hutzler was otherwise not involved in the business.Lisicky, p. 17. After Abram brought his two brothers, Charles and David, into the business in 1867, the retail store was left in David's hands while Abram and Charles operated a wholesale business. The retail store expanded into three other storefronts on Howard Street in 1874, 1881 and 1887, gradually transforming into a department store.Lisicky, p. 18. Abram and Charles discontinued the wholesale business in 1888 to concentrate on the company's retail operations. Entrance to the Hutzler Brothers Palace building at 200 North Howard Street in Baltimore (May 2012) The original Howard Street locations were razed in 1888 and replaced by the five-story Hutzler Brothers Palace Building, designed by the architectural firm of Baldwin & Pennington. An example of neoclassical architecture, the Palace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Its exterior features included Nova Scotia gray stone, carved with Arabesque heads and foliage, and large display windows. Facing Clay Street, a keystone carved with the image of Moses Hutzler was placed over a display window. The new store was organized into several departments and employed 200 workers.Lisicky, p. 19 In 1908, the company incorporated as Hutzler Brothers Company of Baltimore City. This was later amended to Hutzler Brothers Company. =Innovative retail practices= An innovator of progressive retailing practices, Hutzler's was believed to have established the one-price policy in 1868. With one-pricing, all customers pay the same price, set by the store for a specific item, for specific period of time. This policy replaced the process of higgling or haggling to negotiate prices determined by the bargaining skill of individual customers. One-pricing for basic commodities was actually practiced in rural stores before the Civil War, but Hutzler's may have been the first retailer to apply the policy to such a broad range of merchandise, including every item in the store. Hutzler's led the retailing industry as one of the first to establish a liberal return policy, granting refunds to dissatisfied customers, and the first Maryland retailer with its own fleet of delivery trucks. It is also believed to be the first retail chain that did not discriminate against African-American customers. They operated the first bargain counter during the civil war. Downtown expansion Hutzler Brothers \\"Tower\\" building, as seen from Howard Street, May 2012 A five-story building on Saratoga Street and two smaller buildings on Howard Street were added to the Hutzler's downtown location in 1916. Then in 1924 another five floors were added to the Saratoga Street building, bringing it up to 10 floors.Lisicky, p. 22 Hutzler's Downstairs, an outlet for discounted merchandise, opened in the store's basement in September 1929. A five-story art deco style expansion to the downtown store, described as \\"Greater Hutzlers\\", opened on October 1, 1932. This building eventually extended to nine floors and became known as the Tower building. When it reached the peak of its operations in the 1950s, the Downtown location covered of retail space. Suburban expansion In 1952, after nearly 100 years exclusively on the original site, Hutzler's opened its first branch store in Towson, Maryland. Other stores followed at Westview Mall, Eastpoint Mall, Southdale Center (this location was moved to Harundale Mall), Security Square Mall, Harford Mall, White Marsh Mall, and Salisbury Mall. In 1980, a small store in the Inner Harbor area was opened. Designed for customers using automobiles, rather than pedestrian traffic, the Towson Hutzler's lacked the showcase windows of the downtown store. On the third floor of the Towson Hutzler's, customers dining in the store's Valley View Room, also known as the Tea Room, enjoyed a view overlooking the historic Hampton Mansion. The store restaurant had its own bakery, featuring Lady Baltimore cake and Goucher cake.Lisicky, p. 46. =Declining years= In response to declining business in the 1980s, Hutzler's hired Angelo Arena from Marshall Field's in 1983 to take charge of the company and reverse the downward trend. In the Fall of 1984, he moved the downtown store from its original location into the new Atrium building next door, site of Hochschild Kohn's former downtown location. The \\"Palace\\" name was also moved to the new building. By the time Arena arrived in 1983, the Hutzler's Palace store had contracted to of retail floor space. Its new location in the Atrium building reduced Hutzler's to 70,000 square feet. The move to the Atrium was part of a five-year plan, announced by Arena in August 1984, to buy four Hochshild Kohn's locations and to expand Hutzler's from eight to 15 stores in the Baltimore area. Arena's efforts were unsuccessful. Hutzler's began closing stores, first with the Inner Harbor store in December 1986. The other locations followed until 1990, when all were gone. Hutzler's remained a family-owned, Maryland business throughout its 132 years. Its downtown location is believed to hold the record among American department stores for the longest survival at an original location. David A. Hutzler, who joined the company's board in 1976, remained at his position until the company closed in 1990, without going through bankruptcy or lawsuits as its operations ended and assets were liquidated.Lisicky, p. 131.

He is one of three soldiers visited by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. While walking among his troops on the eve of battle, the King arrives incognito upon a trio of soldiers. They are ruminating on their chances of mere survival, let alone victory in the coming fight. The King pretends to be a junior officer and joins in the discussion. Michael Williams espouses his view on the responsibilities a commander has for the men in his charge, to the extent that he may even be responsible for their souls. He has the grand setpiece speech that includes the line; \\"There be few that die well that die in a battle.\\" The King successfully rebukes this, as all soldiers are responsible for their own souls. There is some speculation as to the merits of the King surrendering himself for ransom in order to save the lives of his soldiers. Henry declares he knows the King would never allow himself to be ransomed and would fight the enemy to the death. Williams shows he knows some of the psychology involved, and declares that of course the King would say that, \\"to make us fight cheerfully: but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser.\\" The King says in his guise that if that happened he would \\"never trust the King after.\\" Williams finds that remark to be so ridiculous as to be outrageous‚Äîas if the King would care whether an ordinary man trusted his word or not. The King in return finds he cannot allow his word as a man to be doubted. Williams and Henry agree to settle their argument after the battle, should they live, both wearing charges of the other so they could be recognised. After Agincourt, the victorious King is in a playful mood, and he presents Williams' glove to Fluellen, the Welsh captain, pretending it is a French trophy. When Williams strikes Fluellen to settle the score of the previous night, Fluellen threatens Williams with treason. The King separates them with apologies to Fluellen and promises of gold to Williams for showing honor and bravery. Fluellen tries to add a small amount to Williams' purse, but Michael Williams replies to him; \\"I will none of your money.\\" In his review of Laurence Olivier's version in 1944, reviewer James Agee calls this exchange \\"the most inspired part\\" of the play, as Michael Williams presents the only challenge to Henry in any way, and almost the only personal conflict. Williams' bravery and intelligence is shown as a spur to Henry's own conscience. In the 1989 movie adaptation of Henry V, Williams was played by the British actor Michael Williams; in this version, there is a wordless scene after Agincourt in which the King simply gives the glove to Williams, who initially looks thankful but then shocked as he realizes he has quarreled with the King. The character appears in the 1990 Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Defector\\", in Data's holodeck re-enactment of Act IV, Scene I, played under heavy makeup by Patrick Stewart, who had asked to portray Williams or John Bates due to his unabashed love of Shakespeare.

Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish Autonomy Agreement of 1970 (or the Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish peace talks or the 1970 Peace Accord) was an agreement, which the Iraqi government and the Kurds reached in March 1970, in the aftermath of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, for the creation of an Autonomous Region, consisting of the three Kurdish governorates and other adjacent districts that have been determined by census to have a Kurdish majority. The plan also gave Kurds representation in government bodies, to be implemented in four years.G.S. Harris, Ethnic Conflict and the Kurds, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp.118‚Äì120, 1977 For its time it was the most serious attempt to resolve the long-running Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish conflict. Despite this, the Iraqi government embarked on an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin in the same period. Eventually, the peace plan for the Kurdish autonomy had failed, re-erupting into the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1974, thus escalating the Kurdish‚ÄìIraqi conflict.  Articles  # The Kurdish language shall be, alongside the Arabic language, the official language in areas with a Kurdish majority; and will be the language of instruction in those areas and taught throughout Iraq as a second language. # Kurds will participate fully in government, including senior and sensitive posts in the cabinet and army. # Kurdish education and culture will be reinforced. # All officials in Kurdish majority areas shall be Kurds or at least Kurdish-speaking. # Kurds shall be free to establish student, youth, women's and teachers' organisations of their own. # Funds will be set aside for the development of Kurdistan. # Pensions and assistance will be provided for the families of martyrs and others stricken by poverty, unemployment or homelessness. # Kurds and Arabs will be restored to their former place of habitation. # The Agrarian Reform will be implemented. # The Constitution will be amended to read \\"The Iraqi people is made up of two nationalities, the Arab nationality and the Kurdish nationality.\\" # The broadcasting station and heavy weapons will be returned to the Government. # A Kurd shall be one of the vice- presidents. # The Governorates (Provincial) Law shall be amended in a manner conforming with the substance of this declaration. # Unification of areas with a Kurdish majority as a self-governing unit. # The Kurdish people shall share in the legislative power in a manner proportionate to its population in Iraq.Mcdowall, David.

Within a month of signing, most articles were implemented, and by December Mulla Mustafa Barzani was optimistic about autonomy, but by the end of the year it became clear that the Ba'ath party was just playing for time, as there was an attempt on his son's life.

Origins The first Public Trustee is that of New Zealand; it was proposed by Edward Cephas John Stevens in 1870 due to the difficulty of finding reliable private trustees in the colony and adopted by Prime Minister Julius Vogel who established the Public Trust and installed Jonas Woodward as the world's first Public Trustee on January 1, 1873. Initially it was a part-time for position for one man, the government had not anticipated that much of the public would prefer to trust a bureaucrat with their estate - by the mid 20th century the New Zealand Public Trustee gained nearly 1/3 of the estate market in the country, was undertaking many statutory duties beyond this and employed a staff of a thousand. Meanwhile the idea was spreading, initially across the Tasman, where South Australia established a Public trustee on the same model on 1 January 1881, making it the first Public Trustee established in Australia. Other nations The office of Public Trustee was adopted by several other countries of the Commonwealth, including the United Kingdom, (founded 1906), where it plays a far more limited role, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Singapore, most Canadian provinces and all Australian states. United Kingdom and Australia There is a public trustee in each state and territory of Australia and a similar national position exists under English law. The public trustee primarily performs the role of trustee of deceased's estates where no executor is appointed, or the executor declines to act (and no other person is appropriate). Some public trustees also provide a free or inexpensive service for drawing wills (receiving remuneration upon administering the estate). The public trustees also manage the estates of infants (such as in cases where they receive a damages settlement), prisoners, and others under a disability (legal or otherwise), when required. The public trustee may also act as trustee of unclaimed property in some states (Australia). New Zealand Although much reduced in size after a series of restructurings in the 1990s, and unsuccessful moves into conveyancing, unit trust-like investments and other non-core business, which led to large losses at the end of the decade, the office has now returned to profit. As at 2005 it held over 330,000 wills and drafted over 21,000 wills per year, managed 3,500 residential properties, 400 charitable trusts and 30 farms, employing 450 people at 35 offices. Public Trust was a corporation sole until 2001, when it was moved to a company-like structure called a 'Crown entity'.

He is the author of over forty books and over sixty articles, and he is considered to be one of the most significant American researchers in education, educational psychology, and community psychology. One primary focus of his work was on education reform in the United States. In the 1950s he and George Mandler initiated the research on test anxiety. He founded the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic in 1961 and was one of the principal leaders in the community psychology movement. In 1974, he proposed psychological sense of community, a central concept in community psychology. Since then, sense of community has become a well-known and commonly used term both in academic and non-academic settings. Early life Sarason was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn New York on January 12, 1919. Both of his parents, Maxwell and Anna (Silverlight) Sarason, were Jewish immigrants and his father worked in a children's clothes factory in the garment district of Manhattan. Sarason grew up with his sister, Mildred, and his brother, Irwin (who also became a psychologist). At the age of six his family moved to Newark, New Jersey. Sarason was a teenager during the Great Depression and he sold frozen treats and handkerchiefs to help support his family. During his junior year in high school, Sarason was diagnosed with polio and he lost mobility in his right arm. After a successful surgery that was financed by the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission, he regained some functionality of his right arm. Due to the physical limitations Sarason experienced as a result of polio, he became more interested in writing as a career (one of the activities he could still do with his right arm). He was especially interested in becoming a playwright, and he credited his interest in creative writing as one factor that drew him to psychology. Education Sarason attended public schools throughout his childhood. When he was seven years old, he began attending Temple B‚ÄôNai Abraham, a Hebrew school in New Jersey, on some afternoons and Sunday mornings. As a result of his polio diagnosis, the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission collaborated with Dana College (which was later incorporated into Rutgers University) to provide Sarason with a scholarship loan to attend college. He received a bachelor's degree from Dana College in 1939. He obtained a Master's of Arts (1940) and a Ph.D. (1942) in Clinical Psychology from Clark University. At Clark University his research mentor was Saul Rosenzweig and Sarason was the first student at Clark to obtain practical experience working as an extern at a hospital. Career =Southbury Training School= After obtaining a Ph.D. from Clark University in 1942, Sarason served for three years as the chief psychologist at the Southbury Training School, a residential facility for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Sarason noted that the goal of the Southbury Training School was to train and educate residents, and then help them return to their homes and communities. While at the Southbury Training School, Sarason administered many psychological evaluations and conducted psychotherapy. He developed a humanistic view of people with intellectual disabilities after witnessing their creativity and their rich emotional experiences. Based on his work at the Southbury Training School, he published articles on the use of projective psychological tests with people with intellectual disabilities, the use of creativity in therapy, and conducting psychotherapy with people with intellectual disabilities. While at the Southbury Training School, Sarason became frustrated with individual-based psychological theories that did not consider social context. He also became frustrated by the organization's growing insensitivity toward the well-being of its residents. Sarason stated that the Southbury Training School developed a bureaucratic structure, began to experience departmental rivalries, and lacked effective leadership. He began to wonder why the Southbury Training School deteriorated and whether he could create a setting that effectively and sustainably pursued its purpose. =Yale University= In 1945, Carl Hovland, the chair of the Department of Psychology at Yale, offered Sarason an Assistant Clinical Professor Position. In addition to teaching clinical courses and supervising clinical students in psychological testing and report writing, Sarason also published papers on projective techniques during his first few years at Yale. Although Sarason is not well known for his work on projective techniques, he appreciated this work because it gave him insight into how human problem solving adapts based on the specific task at hand. Intellectual Disability Based largely on his experiences at the Southbury Training School, Sarason published his first book in 1949: Psychological Problems in Mental Deficiency. This book provided a new approach to intellectual disabilities that emphasized social and cultural factors that affect our understanding of intellectual disability. This book became popular in schools of education, and Sarason became well known in the field of education and, more specifically, special education. Teacher Preparation and School Reform In the 1950s, Sarason developed a close friendship and working relationship with Burton Blatt, the chair of the department of special education at New Haven State College. Burton Blatt was interested in working with Sarason because of Sarason's influential research on intellectual disabilities in the field of education. Both Sarason and Blatt were interested in the preparation of teachers, and they believed that teachers lacked training in how to make educational decisions based on observations of student behavior. To highlight this concern, Sarason, Blatt, and another researcher (Ken Davidson) wrote The Preparation of Teachers: An Unstudied Problem in Education. This book emphasized the importance of taking a historical and sociological perspective when considering school reforms, such as considering the history of teacher training programs and how that history may impact teachers‚Äô current work. In 1965, Sarason predicted that all attempts to reform schools would fail. His prediction still has an accuracy of 100%. He believed that schooling needed fundamental changes. Further, he often stated that it was inconceivable to think that an ingrained human social system such as public schooling was easily reformed. The preparation and training of teachers was a good place to begin reform, according to Sarason. Test Anxiety and Situational Factors Affecting Test Performance Sarason's research interests in children's test anxiety developed from his observations that the performance of people with and without intellectual disabilities on intelligence tests could be impacted by anxiety related to the testing environment. For approximately 15 years, Sarason examined how test-taking attitudes and anxiety affect test performance. Summarizing some of his research, Sarason wrote The Clinical Interaction to describe situational factors in testing environments that can lead to inaccurate and confusing test results. Although Sarason's research was considered successful, he described his work as a ‚Äúresearch factory‚Äù and he was frustrated by the lack of socially-relevant action based on his research (e.g., he was frustrated that his research did not lead to programs to help children who experienced high test anxiety). Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic Sarason was frustrated by the lack of social action in his research career, and he seized the opportunity to start a new clinic at Yale University so that he could be more involved in making positive social change. In the late 1950s Sarason was the supervisor of two clinical psychology interns who worked at the Yale Child Study Center, a child psychiatry organization. Because there was a lack of clients available for his supervisees at the Yale Child Study Center, Sarason decided to start a psychology clinic within the Yale Department of Psychology after gaining approval from the chair of the department, Claude Buxton. In the early 1960s Sarason founded the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic. Although some clients did visit the clinic for psychotherapy and clinical assessments, the clinic was unique in that most of the clinic staff spent the majority of their time in community settings working directly with community organizations. The clinic aimed to expand the role of clinical psychologists to include working in community settings and helping to solve community-based problems. Through his work in the clinic, Sarason also sought to better understand the creation and sustainability of settings. He defined settings as ‚Äúany instance in which two or more people come together in new relationships over a sustained period of time in order to achieve certain goals.‚Äù The history of the Yale Psycho- Educational Clinic can be separated into two time periods. During the first time period from 1963 to 1965, Sarason and his colleagues aimed to gain entrance into various settings by partnering with organizations, including public schools, anti-poverty programs, and a center for intellectually disabled people. During the second time period from 1965 to 1973, Sarason and the clinic staff focused on studying how settings were created and factors that influenced their longevity. Sarason's main method of investigation involved him acting as a participant-observer who collaborated with various organizations to help solve problems (e.g., low student academic performance, low recruitment for anti-poverty programs). Based on this work, Sarason argued that clinical psychologists should expand their individual-based focus and consider how broader settings contribute to both well-being and pathology. He also argued that changing and reforming settings requires a deep understanding of those settings. Finally, Sarason identified several issues that are relevant to the creation and sustainability of settings, such as having positive external relationships with other people and organizations, having strong leadership at the organizational level, and maintaining realistic expectations about the organization's needs and influence. Sararson's and his colleagues‚Äô work at the clinic resulted in seven books and many articles. Contributions to the Fields of Psychology and Education Seymour Sarason is considered the ‚Äúfather‚Äù and ‚Äúconscience‚Äù of Community Psychology because he advocated for the development of a psychology that focused on contextual factors that impact human behavior, the prevention of pathology instead of treatment, and being a collaborative partner rather than an expert. Many of the ideas important to the field of Community Psychology originated from Sarason's work with the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic.

It was started in 1897 as a partnership between Max Hochschild, Benno Kohn, and his brother Louis B. Kohn. Hochschild-Kohn & Company opened that year with a downtown-Baltimore store on the northwest corner of Howard and Lexington Streets. The chain closed in 1984. History The company prospered and in 1912 purchased a building at 208 N. Howard Street. When incorporated in 1922, Hochschild-Kohn was Baltimore's largest department store. Space needs led to the purchase of most of the block bounded by Howard, Franklin, Park, and Centre Streets in 1923 in anticipation of building a new, more modern and spacious store, but financial difficulties and Max Hochschild's retirement as president led to the plan's abandonment. (The building now standing at the Howard and Lexington location echoes some of the original building's semi- circular arched door and window profiles.) Benno Kohn died in 1929. Management then consisted of Irving Kohn (Louis' son) president; Walter Sondheim and Walter Kohn, vice-presidents. Although financed by corporate stock, Hochschild-Kohn was still run as a partnership. At that time plans for a new building at Howard and Franklin Streets were abandoned, and the Lexington Street building was leased, improved, and connected to the Howard and Lexington Street property. During the Great Depression, Hochschild-Kohn lost more in sales percentages than the aggregate sales lost by other Baltimore department stores. Sales were down almost fifty percent from 1930 in the Depression's worst year. Management also suffered from discord between Irving and Walter Kohn, who retired in 1935. Management then consisted of Irving Kohn, Walter Sondheim, and Martin Kohn. After illness caused Walter Sondheim to be less active in 1943, and Irving Kohn's death in 1945, Martin B. Kohn became president of the store. Louis Kohn II and Walter Sondheim, Jr. were his vice-presidents. Martin B. Kohn pioneered the suburban expansion of downtown department stores with the opening of Hochschild-Kohn's Edmondson Village store in 1947. Later expansion included stores at York Road and Belvedere Avenue in northern Baltimore in 1948, known as the Hochschild, Kohn Belvedere store, and at Harundale Mall south of the city. Other locations included; Security Square Mall in Woodlawn and The Mall in Columbia in Columbia. In December 1969 Supermarkets General purchased Hochschild's, and did not divulge its purchase price. Under Supermarkets General, Hochschild Kohn's adopted a \\"compete-or-get-trampled-on\\" outlook. The company's York, Pennsylvania store opened on September 27, 1968, followed by its large The Mall in Columbia location on August 2, 1971. Chairman Louis B. Kohn II called the Columbia store's opening, \\"A start of a new era for Hochschild's.\\" Other later locations included, Freestate Mall in Bowie, Maryland. The Bowie location was the last Hochschild's that was to ever open. Unfortunately, by 1984 Supermarket's General closed Hochschild's as a chain, and many Hochschild-Kohn stores were purchased by Hutzler's later that year. These stores included locations such as the Harundale Mall and Security Square Mall, which at the time was the highest volume store for Hochschild's. The Hochschild, Kohn Belvedere store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

The older, longer Gaelic name is Lagan Achaidh Droma, \\"hollow at the field of the ridge\\". Geography Laggan is often considered to be two separate settlements, North Laggan and South Laggan, about one mile apart, both situated between Loch Lochy and Loch Oich. The Caledonian Canal passes by Laggan, linking these two lochs. Laggan Locks, a flight of two locks, connects the canal to Loch Oich. The main A82 road between Glasgow and Inverness passes through Laggan, crossing the canal at Laggan Swing Bridge. The Great Glen Way long distance footpath passes by Laggan, running alongside the canal and following the old railway line. History The Battle of the Shirts was fought nearby in July 1544 between the Macdonalds of Rannald and Clan Fraser of Lovat in the Great Glen, overlooking Loch Lochy. The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway once passed by Laggan. This line opened in 1896, with Invergarry railway station situated at North Laggan.

If a user forgets their password then a password notification email is sent containing enough information for the user to access their account again. This method of password retrieval relies on the assumption that only the legitimate owner of the account has access to the inbox for that particular email address. The process is often initiated by the user clicking on a forgotten password link on the website where, after entering their username or email address, the password notification email would be automatically sent to the inbox of the account holder. Some websites allow the user to choose to include the password in every email sent from the website. This has the problem that all of the emails received must be treated with the same security as a password notification email. The email sent could contain a new, temporary password for the account or a URL that can be followed to enter a new password for that account. The new password or the URL often contain a randomly generated string of text that can only be obtained by reading that particular email. Another method used is to send all or part of the original password in the email. Sending only a few characters of the password, can help the user to remember their original password, without having to reveal the whole password to them. Security problems The main issue is that the contents of the password notification email can be easily discovered by anyone with access to the inbox of the account owner. This could be as a result of shoulder surfing or if the inbox itself is not password protected. The contents could then be used to compromise the security of the account. The user would therefore have the responsibility of either securely deleting the email or ensuring that its contents are not revealed to anyone else. A partial solution to this problem, is to cause any links contained within the email to expire after a period of time, making the email useless if it is not used quickly after it is sent. One problem with sending the original password in the email is that the password contained within could be used to access other accounts used by the user, if that user had chosen to use the same password for two or more accounts. Emails are often not secure so, unless the email had been encrypted prior to being sent, the contents could be read by anyone who eavesdrops on the email.

It commonly includes ward admission, anesthesia, surgery, and recovery. Perioperative may refer to the three phases of surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative, though it is a term most often used for the first and third of these only - a term which is often specifically utilized to imply 'around' the time of the surgery. The primary concern of perioperative care is to provide better conditions for patients before operation (sometimes construed as during operation) and after operation.Spry, Cynthia. Essentials of Perioperative Nursing. 3rd ed. Jones & Bartlett Publishers. 2005.  Perioperative care  Perioperative care is the care that is given before and after surgery. It takes place in hospitals, in surgical centers attached to hospitals, in freestanding surgical centers, or health care providers' offices. This period is used to prepare the patient both physically and psychologically for the surgical procedure and after surgery. For emergency surgeries this period can be short and the patient may be oblivious to this; for elective surgeries 'preops', as they are called, can be quite lengthy. Information obtained during preoperative assessment is used to create a care plan for the patient.  Phases  = Preoperative = The preoperative phase is used to perform tests, attempt to limit preoperational anxiety and may include the preoperative fasting. = Intraoperative = The intraoperative period begins when the patient is transferred to the operating room table and ends with the transfer of a patient to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). During this period the patient is monitored, anesthetized, prepped, and draped, and the operation is performed. Nursing activities during this period focus on safety, infection prevention, opening additional sterile supplies to the field if needed and documenting applicable segments of the intraoperative report in the patients Electronic Health Record. Intraoperative radiation therapy and Intraoperative blood salvage may also be performed during this time. = Postoperative = The postoperative period begins after the transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and terminates with the resolution of the surgical sequelae. It is quite common for the very last of this period to end outside of the care of the surgical team. It is uncommon to provide extended care past the discharge of the patient from the PACU.

This example has a single sliding nasal bar and fixed peak to protect the face, Dutch mid-17th century The lobster-tailed pot helmet, also known as the zisch√§gge, horseman's pot and harquebusier's pot, was a type of post-Renaissance combat helmet. It became popular in Europe, especially for cavalry and officers, from c. 1600; it was derived from an Ottoman Turkish helmet type. The helmet gradually fell out of use in most of Europe in the late 17th century; however, the Austrian heavy cavalry retained it for some campaigns as late as the 1780s. The French term capeline was also used for this helmet, however, usage of this word was not precise. \\"Capeline\\" was indiscriminately used to denote various types of hat, and helmets other than the lobster-tailed pot. Origin A Turkish √ái√ßak helmet (16th century), ancestral to the later lobster-tailed pot helmet. The cheekpieces and neck guard are supplemented by a mail defence in this example (The Metropolitan Museum of Art) The lobster-tailed pot helmet had an oriental origin, being derived from the Ottoman Turkish √ßi√ßak (pronounced 'chichak', Turkish ‚Äì √ßi√ßek √ái√ßek means flower in Turkish which is attributed to the shape of the helmets top side) helmet, which developed in the 16th century. It was adopted by the Christian states of Europe in the early 17th century. The chichak was almost identical to the later European helmets ‚Äì it had a forward projecting peak, sliding bar nasal, cheekpieces and neck guard; only its tendency to have a conical rather than rounded skull was distinctive.Robinson pp. 62-63 The European derivative of this helmet saw widespread use during the Thirty Years War when it became known as the zisch√§gge, a Germanisation of the original Turkish name. Characteristics English helmet for a harquebusier c. 1635, with typical three-barred face protection and longitudinal comb on the skull, the laminated and hinged cheekpiece is incomplete The lobster-tailed pot had a rounded skull-piece, which was sometimes fluted. The skulls of English-made helmets were usually formed from two sections, joined by a raised comb running from front to back; the skulls of helmets manufactured on the continent were most often raised from a single-piece of metal. Cheekpieces, commonly made in one piece but occasionally articulated, were attached to the skull by leather strapping; however, the better quality examples are sometimes hinged. To protect the face there was either a fixed forward projecting peak that incorporated a sliding nasal bar retained by a large screw, or a hinged peak with three attached bars. Finally, the helmet had a laminated defence (or a single-piece of plate ridged to imitate separate lames) to protect the back of the head and neck that was said to resemble the tail of a lobster.Blackmore, pp. 15-16Oakeshott, pp. 221-222 Another common name for the helmet was the \\"harquebusier's pot\\", the harquebusier being the most common type of cavalry in Western Europe during the 17th century.Tincey, p. 5 The single nasal-bar type was characteristic of Continental Europe, whilst the three-barred type with a pivoting peak was more widely used in the British Isles.Blackmore, p. 15 Many European-made lobster-tailed pot helmets were later imported to Britain during the English Civil War. Occasionally, older helmets like the burgonet or sallet were modified to resemble the 'lobster-pot.'Blackmore, p. 16 As stated by General George Monck in 1644, the \\"headpiece with three small bars\\" was intended to be pistol-proof.Tincey, p. 11 Decoration and appearance Modern reproduction of a helmet of James II of England made in 1686. The face protection is in the form of an openwork depiction of the royal coat-of-arms The appearance and finish of lobster-tailed pots varied greatly, from the highly decorated, superb-quality examples made for individual commanders down to crudely executed \\"munition-quality\\" types, which were mass- produced to equip large numbers of ordinary cavalry troopers. High quality helmets could be decorated using a range of techniques, including repouss√©, engraving and blue-and-gilt finishes. An extant helmet made for King James II of England had the three bar face defence replaced by a pierced openwork plate depicting the full royal arms of England, sight being afforded by spaces within the design. Many helmets were blackened or browned as a treatment to weatherproof them and protect against rust. The better quality helmets given this treatment would often have had their sombre appearance relieved by the use of numerous gilded rivet heads. Some of the most flamboyantly decorated helmets were produced for the Polish winged hussars, with metal crests and enlarged, decoratively shaped, nasals being not uncommon.Bull, pp. 111, 118, 121 A number of extant helmets have tubular plume-holders attached, this, taken with the evidence of contemporary illustrations, indicates the use of feather plumes.Blackmore, pp. 15-16 Use Polish Hussar szyszak with elaborate wing-like crests of pierced metal, 17th century This form of helmet was widely used during the Thirty Years War and English Civil War; it was commonly known as a zisch√§gge in Germany and a 'horseman's pot' or 'three- barred pot' in Britain; the term 'lobster-tailed pot' is widely used in modern scholarship. The typical cavalryman of the period, the harquebusier, would have worn the helmet with a buff coat, bridle-hand gauntlet and breastplate and backplate. It was also sometimes worn by a more heavily armoured type of cavalry, the cuirassier, combined with three-quarter armour.Tincey, pp. 11-12 It was used by cavalry on both sides of the English Civil War including Oliver Cromwell's Ironside cavalry.Blackmore pp. 15-16 The common misconception of Cavaliers wearing plumed wide-brimmed hats whilst the Roundheads wore helmets is definitively disproved by a surviving order signed by Charles I himself for 33 'potts', along with other cavalry armour, for the use of his own troop of horse in 1642. Another order, this time from the Parliamentarian authorities, dating to 1644 for 300 \\"potts with three barres English\\" indicates that each helmet, no doubt of basic quality, cost 7 shillings.Tincey, p. 12 Similar helmets were worn in the 17th century by Polish winged hussars and were termed \\"szyszak\\" in Polish, again a derivative of the original Turkish name.Brzezinski, p. 7 Austrian cuirassiers were equipped with the lobster- tailed pot helmet as late as the 1780s, long after its use had died out elsewhere, when campaigning against the Ottoman Turks.Haythornthwaite, p. 16 Gallery File:Westgate 040.jpg|Cuirass and lobster-tailed pot helmet of the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), displayed at West Gate Towers and Museum, Canterbury, England.

He was Party Secretary of the National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista, or PNF) from October 1939 until shortly after the entry of Italy into World War II on 10 June 1940. World War I and Fiume Born in Ravenna, Romagna, Muti was banned from any school in the country at age 13, after punching one of his teachers. The next year, he ran away from home in order to fight in World War I, but was recovered and returned by the Carabinieri. At 15, a new attempt was successful, and Muti joined the famed Arditi. On the front, Muti distinguished himself through feats of audacity. His detachment of 800 men was ordered to establish a bridgehead under enemy fire: it managed to do so, but was only left with 23 members at the end of the day. Gabriele D'Annunzio benefitted from Muti's services during his seizing of Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia) in September 1919-January 1921; he gave Muti the lasting moniker Gim dagli occhi verdi (\\"Green-Eyed Jim\\"). In fact, Muti was rarely involved in fighting over Fiume, being more likely to engage in flamboyant stunts. D'Annunzio told Muti: \\"You are the expression of Superhuman values, a weightless impetus, a boundless offering, a fistful of incense over the embers, the scent of a pure soul\\". Between the World Wars During this time, Muti met Benito Mussolini, for whom he developed a lasting fascination. A Fascist as soon as the Fiume episode came to an end, he was arrested on several occasions. On 29 October 1922, he was head of the squad that occupied Ravenna City Hall during the March on Rome. After the taking over of the state, Ettore Muti made a career in the Blackshirts, organized as the \\"Voluntary State Security Militia\\" (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, MVSN). His life remained adventurous: a womanizer and entertaining host, Muti cruised in speeding cars or on his Harley Davidson. In 1926 he married the daughter of a banker, and, in 1929, fathered his only child Diana. He escaped an assassination attempt carried out by a left-wing activist on 13 September 1927, but was shot twice in his abdomen and arm, as a result. His survival was uncertain for a period of time, and he was left with a 20 cm scar. He joined the Regia Aeronautica (Italian air force), developing a passion for aircraft - he accepted demotion to lieutenant, according to the practical requirements of the service. He flew during the Second Italo- Abyssinian War in 1935-1936, where his skills as a pilot earned him a Silver Medal of Military Valor. In 1936 he returned to Italy, but left soon after as a volunteer on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War, fighting under the pseudonym Gim Valeri. He led a squadron of bombers over Republican ports, winning several silver medals, and, in 1938, a Gold Medal of Military Valor. He returned with the new moniker Cid alato (\\"The Winged El Cid\\") and the prestigious Military Order of Savoy. Later in 1938, he left for Italian- influenced Albania, staying on through its full occupation by the Italians in 1939 (and winning another medal). In World War II Upon his return, Muti was awarded the PNF Party Secretary position replacing Achille Starace. He was awarded this position based on the intervention of his friend Galeazzo Ciano. However, Muti disliked this inactive duty, and profited from the outbreak of the war to return in the military. As a Lieutenant Colonel, Muti participated during the Italian invasion of France, during the long-range bombing of Haifa and Bahrain,Time Magazine, Daily Damage and during the Battle of Britain. However, his hasty departure from his Party Secretary position made him lose the friendship of both Ciano and Mussolini. In 1943, Muti joined the military intelligence service. On 25 July, the day of the pro-Allied coup d'√©tat in the Grand Council of Fascism, Muti was in Spain, trying to obtain the radar of a United States aircraft that had crashed on neutral territory. He returned to Rome on 27 July, and remained in his private villa. On the night of 23-24 August, a group of Carabinieri entered his residence and placed him under arrest. They all left through a pine forest surrounding the area, and the following moments are still mysterious. The official communiqu√© stated: > Following an investigation into major irregularities in the administration > of a state-associated entity, during which the implication of the ex- > secretary of the dissolved fascist party, Ettore Muti, has become apparent, > the Carabinieri military corps proceeded in Muti's arrest at Fregene, near > Fiumicino (then part of the comune of Rome), on the night of 23-24 August. > As they led him to their barracks, the escort was shot at with several > rounds from the forest. In the momentary disturbance, he attempted to run > away, but, after being shot at and wounded by the Carabinieri, he died. The major irregularities mentioned were never clarified, nor were the identities of shooters in the forest. In the dramatic gunfight, Muti was the only one hit: his cap displayed two holes, one in the back of the head, the other in front. Other circumstances point as well towards a political execution, with Ettore Muti as the first victim in the violence that engulfed Italy for the next two years. Pietro Badoglio, the leader who had deposed Mussolini, defined Muti as \\"a menace\\" in a letter he had previously sent to the head of the local police: it is likely that Muti was informed about the role of Badoglio in the catastrophic Italian defeat of Caporetto, a role that Badoglio in the years after World War I had tried to hide. After his death, Muti became the main hero of Italian fascist regime (revived in northern Italy with help from Nazi Germany, as the Italian Social Republic). His name was given to an autonomous Police Legion stationed in Milan and to one of the most feared Black Brigades units.

Porter returned to comics that year with a six-issue run of Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, reuniting with writer Waid. In July 2004, Porter signed a two-year exclusive contract with DC, and began as regular penciller of The Flash, with writer Geoff Johns and inker John Livesay. In 2006, DC announced Porter would pencil the limited series The Trials of Shazam!, collaborating with writer Judd Winick. Unfortunately he was unable to finish the series because he severely injured his hand (severed a nerve and almost the entire tendon in his thumb) and had to take time out from comics for recovery.Off the DL: The Return of Howard Porter, Newsarama, October 1, 2008 Unable to draw, he worked as a school bus driver until his return in late 2008, when he drew DC Universe: Decisions #2. He became the regular penciller on Titans and then was the first artist for the Doc Savage series. He also drew an issue of The Brave and the Bold featuring a team-up between Static and Black Lightning. He then became the regular penciler on DC Comics' Magog for the series' first ten issues, before being replaced by Scott Kolins. As of 2016, Howard Porter is still drawing for DC Comics, with recent works including Superman Beyond, \\"Justice League 3000\\", \\"Superman\\" and \\"Scooby-Doo.\\" In September 2014, Porter was the artist put forward by DC to create the poster and key art for the UFC 181 MMA fight event. Porter - a huge fan of the UFC - created art featuring the main four fighters on the UFC 181 card as superheroes.

Hilton migrated to television in the 1950s, where he was able to establish himself as a director. However, his attempts to direct for the big screen were fairly disastrous, with his 1953 film Cat-Women of the Moon generally being regarded nowadays as a camp classic. Retreating back to television, and back in his editing capacity, Hilton worked on such series as Lassie, Mission: Impossible and the 1977 mini-series Washington: Behind Closed Doors, for which he received a nomination from the American Cinema Editors Association.

He played domestic cricket for Canterbury from 1977 to 1991. Domestic career McEwan played for Old Collegians in Christchurch and Ian Cromb influenced him as a young club player. He made his first-class debut for Canterbury during the 1976-77 season. McEwan was a product of St Andrew's College, Graham Dowling's old school, and went on to pass Dowling's run- scoring record for Canterbury. McEwan scored consistently for Canterbury for over a decade. His best seasons were 1983-84, when he scored 713 runs at 59.41, and 1989‚Äì90, when, aged 36, he scored 758 runs at 44.58. In his last season, 1990‚Äì91, he scored over 500 runs at 43.41. One of the best examples of his attacking batting was when his 155 and 35-ball 50 against Auckland won the Shell Trophy for Canterbury in the last game of the 1983-84 season. In 1984-85 McEwan was brought in as a late replacement for the Young New Zealand tour of Zimbabwe under the captaincy of Jeff Crowe. He was the New Zealand team's highest scorer, with 364 runs at 91.00 in the four games, after a first-ball duck in the first. McEwan had his Benefit Year for Canterbury (the first given by the province) during the 1988-89 season. During the 1990-91 season, McEwan's last, New Zealand Cricket published the New Zealand first-class Master-Blaster averages. The qualification was 500 runs. No one \\"batted a thousand\\" for the season, but the nearest was McEwan, who hit 521 runs off 618 balls with a strike rate of 843 per 1000 balls faced. An example of McEwan's strike power was his century at Lancaster Park against Northern Districts. Coming in fifteen minutes after lunch, he was 99 not out at tea, and totalled 103 off 108 balls. While there may have been disappointment that McEwan did not achieve expectations on the international stage, he ended his career as Canterbury's greatest run scorer (5940) with the most centuries (11). He was also the first player to make 100 appearances for Canterbury, ending his career with 103 games. In total, McEwan scored 6677 runs from 115 matches at 34.95 with twelve centuries and forty-three fifties. He had a highest score of 155 and he took 82 catches. With his bowling McEwan took 29 wickets at 38.79 with best figures of 3-25. His first class one-day career had brought 1643 runs from 77 matches at 23.81 with one century and eight fifties. McEwan had a highest score of 106 and he took 30 catches. He took 27 wickets at 36.44 with best bowling figures of 3-31. McEwan told The Press, \\"Every ball I faced I endeavoured to score runs. There is so much dead cricket, so many balls just patted back. Garfield Sobers said the best line of defence is attack and I was always looking to dominate a game. I wanted to be on top of the game\\". International career McEwan was a hard-hitting, orthodox right-hand batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who deserved greater opportunity to play and tour with the New Zealand team. Despite having a hard-hitting bent, he never managed to fire at international level. McEwan played only four test matches and seventeen one day matches for New Zealand. Perhaps if he had been given more touring opportunities he may have made a far greater contribution to New Zealand cricket. McEwan made his test debut in the 1979-80 series against the West Indies and toured Australia in 1980-1 and Pakistan in 1984-5. Books *Appleby, M., Canterbury Cricket. 100 Greats.

Biography Illarion Pryanishnikov was born in the village of Timashovo (today's Kaluga Oblast) in a family of merchants. From 1856 to 1866 he studied in the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in the classes of Evgraf Sorokin and Sergey Zaryanko. His picture Jokers. Gostiny Dvor in Moscow, painted in the last year of education, straight away brought to him a wide reputation. In this small canvas he gives an original solution of a theme of the humiliation of human dignity, callousness and cruelty in the world, where everything is bought and is sold. After depicting the tipsy merchants, who with a jeer are compelled to dance under the concertina and a poor elderly official, the artist authentically demonstrates a whole gallery of the specimens of moral deformity and complacent caddishness. The painting caused indignation in some adherents of official academic art who felt that the young painter appeared as the destroyer of the \\"high\\" destination of the art which was to express in the ideal form the eternal truths. In 1870 Pryanishnikov received the title of the \\"painter of 1st degree\\". From 1873 until his death he was a teacher in the MSoPSA and his apprentices were Konstantin Korovin, Vitold Byalynitsky- Birulya, Mikhail Nesterov, Alexei Stepanov and others. From the outset of the existence of the union of Peredvizhniks, he was a member, and from the second exhibition he was one of directors of the union. Although Pryanishnikov lived in mainly in Moscow, he often visited the Russian north where he sketched. He took part in the decoration of the original Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, which was demloshed in 1931. Pryanishnikov died in Moscow where one of the streets was named after him.

The most common continuous tone images are digital photographs every single pixel of which can take a continuous range of colors depending on the quantity of captured radiance. On the other hand, at a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of continuous tones. For details, see film grain. Therefore, film is a halftone medium. An example of a continuous-tone device is a CRT computer screen. Here, any pixel can represent any color, because the color components of the pixel are analog and can vary in infinite steps, and hence do not need halftones to make the colors. Of course, because the computer is a digital device, it cannot provide the CRT with infinite tone variations. In 24-bit color mode, it provides the monitor with 256 discrete steps for each channel (red, green, and blue), for a total of 16,777,216 (2563) discrete colors. A purely analog video signal (one that has not been manipulated by a computer of any kind) can provide infinite tone variations inside its own gamut. A halftone device, in contrast, uses discrete dots of color, which at a certain distance look closely like the intended color. Examples of this are inkjet printers.

The .375 H&H; cartridge featured a belt to ensure the correct headspace, which otherwise might be unreliable, given the narrow shoulder of the cartridge case. The cartridge was designed to use cordite which was made in long strands ‚Äì hence the tapered shape of the case, which, as a beneficial side effect also helped in smooth chambering and extraction from a rifle's breech. The .375 H&H; often is cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially in shooting large and dangerous game. With bullet weights ranging from 270 grains (17 g) to 350 grains (23 g), it has the necessary punch for small to medium game, as well as large, thick-skinned dangerous game. The most common bullet weight available in this caliber is 300 grains (19 g). In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals, the .375 H&H; is seen as the minimum acceptable caliber, and in many places (primarily in Africa) it is now the legal minimum for hunting such game. African game guides, professional hunters, and dangerous game cullers have repeatedly voted the .375 H&H; as their clear preference for an all-round caliber if they could have only one rifle. Alaskan game guides have expressed a similar preference for brown bear and polar bear country. Unlike many other calibers, .375 H&H; Magnum rifles achieve nearly the same point of impact over a wide range of bullet weights at all commonly used distances. This simplifies a hunter's choice in selecting different bullet weights, based upon the game hunted, by requiring fewer scope or sight adjustments, which further serves to popularize the .375 H&H; Magnum among professional hunters.http://www.norma.cc/content.asp?Typ=59‚ü™=2&DocumentID;=305&Submeny;=4&Rubrik;=Calibers&Title;=375%20Holland%20&%20Holland%20Magnum History and origins The .375 H&H; Magnum is the result of competition between British rifle manufacturers to develop new cartridges to take advantage of the new smokeless powders. The 9.5√ó57mm Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer cartridge had a major influence on British rifle manufacturers and was soon adopted by Westley Richards and Eley as the .375 Rimless Nitro Express 2.25\\". In an effort to compete, Holland & Holland introduced the .400/375 Belted Nitro Express. The .400/375 H&H; (also known as the .375 Velopex) as it is sometimes known was the first cartridge manufactured to feature a belt. The addition of a belt to a rimless cartridge design provided the advantage of allowing for correct headspacing of highly tapered cartridges (an advantage of flanged cartridges) and smooth feeding through magazine rifles (the advantage of rimless cartridges). The introduction of the 9.3√ó62mm Mauser cartridge in 1905 had a profound and lasting influence on hunters in Africa. Compared to the British double rifles, the Mauser was a far less expensive rifle to manufacture and therefore cheaper to acquire. The double rifles gained little from industrialization whereas the Mauser rifles had gained from mass production due to contracts to produce military rifles for many countries. The result was cheap magazine rifles capable of firing one of the very best candidates for the all round hunting cartridge in Africa. The influence of Mauser's 98 action should not be understated; British gunmakers such as Rigby were purchasing the Mauser 98 actions for use in their own rifles with their own cartridges. The popularity of the 9.3√ó62mm Mauser was such that everyone from the German farmers in Africa to the white hunters from Europe discarded their previous doubles and less powerful magazine rifles and took to the 9.3√ó62mm. The 9.3√ó62mm demonstrated that it was adequate for everything from the dik-dik to the elephant and had acquired a reputation to match. This trend did not go unnoticed by British rifle manufacturers. Between 1909 and 1911 Holland & Holland, Jeffery, Rigby, and Westley Richards introduced their own cartridges: .375 H&H; Magnum, .404 Jeffery, .416 Rigby, and the .425 Westley Richards in an effort to stem the tide of the 9.3√ó62mm. Holland & Holland decided that the rifle had to fire a bullet with an adequate sectional density as the bullet of the 9.3√ó62mm Mauser cartridge which had demonstrated that it had the required penetration on thick skinned dangerous game. Secondly, the cartridge would require a high velocity so as to provide this penetration at extended ranges. Thirdly, the cartridge must function reliably through a magazine rifle in tropical conditions and this required a tapered case working at lower pressures. Holland & Holland had determined that to provide adequate penetration a bullet with the sectional density similar to the 9.3√ó62mm required impact velocities of about . Drawing from anecdotal evidence of hunters it was also determined that high velocities provided impressive kills on game. Another added advantage of the high velocities was that a range misjudgment would be mitigated by the flatter trajectory of a HV projectile. Holland & Holland‚Äôs new cartridge was named .375 Holland and Holland Magnum, and was released together with a flanged or rimmed version (.375 Flanged Magnum also known as the .375 Nitro Express). It featured the belt from the .400/375 H&H; cartridge, fired a bullet which had the same sectional density of the 9.3√ó62mm bullet at a velocity of . The cartridge burned cordite and had a rather low working pressure of by modern standards so that spent cases would extract reliably in the tropical environments of India and Africa. Original cordite loads were as follows: * 62 grains for the 235-gr bullet, yielding a listed 2,800 feet per second * 61 grains for the 270-gr bullet, yielding a listed 2,650 feet per second * 58 grains for the 300-gr bullet, yielding a listed 2,500 feet per secondKen Waters, Pet Loads, p. 440 The new cartridge was a proprietary design unlike the 9.3√ó62mm and was considerably longer than its German counterpart. While many .375 H&H; rifles were built on the longer magnum Mauser actions, these actions were considerably more expensive and rarer than the standard actions. Standard actions could be used but required modifications to allow for flawless feeding and cycling of the .375 H&H; Magnum cartridge. So while the .375 H&H; provided considerable advantages over the 9.3√ó62mm, the significantly greater cost of the H&H; rifles presented a roadblock to the adoption of the .375 H&H; over the 9.3√ó62mm cartridge and remained for a time a less attractive option. At the end of World War I, Holland & Holland released the cartridge to the public for general trade. Also, new markets opened in America as more hunters sought to hunt in Africa. The .375 H&H; was seen by many as the best medium bore dangerous game cartridge available for African safari hunting and which could be easily put to use for hunting large game in North America. Winchester was the first US gunmaker to produce rifles chambered for the cartridge and did so beginning in 1925. The end of World War II saw many gun makers turning to the civilian shooting market when war time contracts began running out. FN, Mauser, Remington and Winchester began turning out quality bolt-action rifles and with increasing number of sportsmen taking to Africa saw the .375 H&H; increasing in popularity. A further boost in popularity came when African colonies enacted legislation stipulating that the or the be the minimum bullet diameter for dangerous game. The legislating away of sub minimum cartridges forced the users of these cartridges to pick up a cartridge which qualified for the shooting of these game species and the logical choice was to move up to the .375 H&H; Magnum. Design & specifications The .375 H&H; Magnum case design was conceived to use cordite; a stick type propellant used widely in the United Kingdom. The tapering cartridge body design and the small shallow shoulder are typical aspects of cartridges optimized for the use of this propellant. An advantage of such a case design is that it will feed and extract smoothly thus contributing to the cartridge's reliability in the field. Unlike previous cartridges, the .375 H&H; operates at relatively higher pressures and was designed from the outset for use with smokeless powders that can generate higher pressures and thus higher velocities. However, when the cartridge was designed pressure levels were held to as cordite was sensitive to temperature and could cause dangerously high pressures in the hot tropical climates of Africa and India. However, modern smokeless powders are not as sensitive to ambient temperatures as cordite and therefore both the C.I.P. and SAAMI provide far higher allowable pressures than the original loading of the cartridge allowed. :.375 Holland & Holland Magnum CIP corresponding dimensions ‚Äì All dimensions in inches (mm) C.I.P. recommends that commencement of rifling begin at . Bore diameter is given as and groove diameter is . C.I.P. recommends a six groove barrel contour with each groove having an arc length of and a twist rate of one rotation in . Maximum chamber pressure is given at . There are no discrepancies between SAAMI and C.I.P. values. However, C.I.P. measures angle Œ± (shoulder angle) as 29¬∞55'43\\". SAAMI measure the shoulder angle as Œ±/2 which is given by SAAMI to be 15¬∞. Performance When the .375 H&H; Magnum was released in 1912 it was loaded with three bullet weights: a at , at and a at . However, today, with the availability of a wide range of powders, velocities gains of can be realized. Acceptable bullet weights for the .375 H&H; Magnum range from to . The lighter bullets, those weighing to are suitable for lighter plains game. Bullets weighing between to can be used on heavy bodied plains game. Bullets weighing to should be reserved for heavy dangerous game. Today, a typical factory load such as Remington‚Äôs R375M1 or Federal‚Äôs ammunition will launch a spitzer bullet at with of energy at the muzzle. This load has approximately the same trajectory as the 180-grain (12 g) bullet from a .30-06 Springfield.

Sporting usage Game Class vs 6 inch Maximum Point Blank Range of some 375 Magnum cartridges The .375 H&H; Magnum is one of the most versatile cartridges and is referred to by Jack O‚ÄôConnor as the \\"Queen of the Medium Bores\\". The cartridge is very popular in Africa where it is considered one of the best all-round rifle cartridges. It is capable of taking any big species including all the Big Five game animals. The big game hunter, John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor, held the .375 H&H; Magnum in such high esteem that he dedicated a chapter to it in the book African Rifles and Cartridges. Ammunition loaded with the or heavier bullet on the .375 H&H; is adequate for heavy thick-skinned dangerous game such as elephant and rhinoceros in most conditions. Today, due to the pace at which hunting is conducted and the requirement of success within certain time constraints, the .375 H&H; Magnum is considered under powered for class 4 game like elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo as the only shooting situation that might present itself might be an adverse one. However, there is little doubt that it has been successfully used to take these heavy dangerous game species. There is some speculation that the .375 H&H; Magnum has been used to take more Big Five game than any other cartridge. Even today, many professional hunters, outfitters and wildlife management personnel in Africa continue to rely on the .375 H&H; Magnum to carry out their duties throughout the continent. Bullets weighing will have sectional densities between .330 and .356. These bullets can be launched at velocities between giving these bullets greater penetration than a .458 bullet at . Sectional Density vs Ballistic Coefficient of some 375 Magnum cartridges Bullets weighing are perfect for the largest cats such as the lion or tiger and other dangerous class 3 game. While these felines do not require extremely powerful cartridges, (a .300 Winchester Magnum can be considered a minimum for these cats), local requirements or regulations may require a larger cartridge than the .375 H&H; Magnum. This range of bullets also is a great choice for most plains game species in Africa, elk, red deer and moose (called elk in Europe) in North America and Europe. There are a great number of rifles (and even a few handguns, such as adapted Howdah pistols) chambered for the .375 H&H.; Many types of actions are used, including single-shots, double-rifles, and bolt actions. When hunting dangerous game, a double-rifle or a controlled- feed bolt-action rifle is most commonly recommended, as a quick follow-up shot may be necessary, and reliability of the firearm becomes of paramount importance. The one sport in which the .375 H&H; Magnum has made some gains in has been the Big Bore Shoots such as those sponsored by the Big Bore Association of South Africa and its affiliated chapters. The .375 H&H; Magnum is considered a transitional bore by the association and the minimum cartridge which is allowable for score keeping. Variants The .375 H&H; Magnum's long tapering body and shallow shoulders are generally believed not to promote long case life due to case head separation above the belt. The case design does not promote the optimal use of the cartridge size to gain performance. Modern cartridges have very little taper so as to benefit from a larger powder capacity. There have been a few attempts to improve the performance of the cartridge. =.375 Flanged Magnum= The .375 Flanged Magnum (9.5√ó75mmR), also known as the .375 H&H; Flanged Magnum is the companion cartridge to the .375 H&H; Magnum for use in double rifles and was released together with the .375 H&H; Magnum by Holland & Holland.

The cartridge is capable of firing a bullet at , a bullet at and a bullet at with muzzle energies of , and respectively. The cartridge is appropriate for the same game species as the .375 H&H; Magnum cartridge. =.375 H&H; Ackley Improved= The .375 H&H; Ackley Improved was a cartridge designed by P. O. Ackley in an effort improve on the performance and case life of the .375 H&H; Magnum. The improved case follows the formulaic Ackley design of a body of little taper and steep shoulder of 40¬∞. The cartridge was found to be capable of with a bullet. A .375 H&H; Magnum cartridge can be chambered and fired safely in an Ackley Improved chamber but with a loss of performance. A .375 H&H; Magnum case thus fired will form to the Ackley Improved chamber. =.375 Weatherby Magnum= The .375 Weatherby Magnum is an improved case like the .375 H&H; Ackley Improved. The case was designed by Roy Weatherby in 1944 and features the Weatherby double radius shoulder typical of all Weatherby cartridges. The .375 Weatherby Magnum is capable of launching a at . The .375 H&H; Magnum can be fired in the chamber of a .375 Weatherby Magnum with a slight loss in performance. Unlike the .375 H&H; AI cartridge, the .375 Weatherby Magnum is loaded to higher pressures than its parent cartridge. As a parent cartridge The distinctive belted case of this cartridge was patented in Britain on 31 March 1891 by G. Roth of Austria. The first commercial use of the patent was in 1907 for the .375 Holland-Schoenauer cartridge for a Mannlicher‚ÄìSchoenauer bolt-action rifle marketed by Holland & Holland.

This association is not legal but is tolerated by the Moroccan authorities. The current leader is Mohammed Abbadi, who was elected secretary-general of the organization. Policies Yassine acted as a charismatic leader for the organisation, which attributes him near saintly-status and operates on lines similar to those a Moroccan Sufi brotherhood (Zaouia boutchichia), of which Yassine was a member prior to his politicisation. The party advocates the transformation of Morocco into an Islamist state, ruled by its interpretation of the Shariah. Like the Muslim Brotherhood, it works for the Islamisation of the whole society, through its grassroots social welfare organisations and important presence in universities. Contrary to the legalist Justice and Development Party, Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane has not been allowed to transform itself into a political party by the Moroccan government, it has also been argued that it's the party's choice to not do so as it refuses to enter the political game under the current political practices, which it perceives as illegitimate; the party also opposes the article of the Moroccan constitution which states that the king Mohammed VI is also Amir al-Muminin. =Three No's= The organization's principles were summed up and reaffirmend, during the 24 December 2012 press conference following Mohammed Abbadi election, as \\"No to violence, no to secrecy, no to foreign intervention.\\" Cult of personality around its former leader and interpretation of his dreams The association is entirely centred on the personality of Abdesslam Yassine, who died 13 December 2012. Through the year 2005, the association reportedly developed the idea of a qawma, a revolution, for 2006, after a series of dreams of association members. Many Adlists think these dreams refer to the immediate abolition of the monarchy in Morocco and the instauration of a Caliphate. In spring 2005, Nadia Yassine, Yassine's daughter, who heads the feminist branch of the organisation, said in an interview to the Moroccan newspaper Al Ousbouiya Al Jadida that she believed that Monarchy is not appropriate for Morocco. Yassine and two journalists from the newspaper are facing charges for defamation of the monarchy relating to the remarks, although her trial has twice been postponed. Publicly, the group has denied any revolutionary plans, arguing rather that Moroccan stability is at serious risk not from it but due to persistently high levels of unemployment and poverty.

It is a unicameral legislature. The assembly is situated at the Independence Square in Paramaribo, after a fire completely destroyed the old building of representation on 1 August 1996. The 51 members of parliament are elected every five years by open list proportional representation on the basis of the country's component districts. The most recent elections were held on 25 May 2020. The current Chairman of the Assembly, Marinus Bee, was appointed on 14 July 2020. Dew Sharman was appointed as Vice Chairman on 29 June 2020.  History  The National Assembly in Paramaribo The first representation was formed by the Colonial States, from 1866. The name was changed to Estates of Suriname in 1936. When Suriname became an independent republic on 25 November 1975, the representation was named Parliament of the Republic of Suriname. This Parliament was made inoperative during the coup d'√©tat of 1980. In 1985, the Parliament was replaced by an appointed Assembly. The National Assembly, in its current form, dates from 1987. In that year, democracy was reestablished after the coup and a new constitution was adopted, organizing the Assembly, so new elections could be held on 25 November 1987. From here on, elections were held. In some cases, a two-thirds majority is required, like the election of the President. If those votes fail, De Verenigde Volksvergadering (The United Nation Meeting) is called. In those meetings, the Districts and Resorts will participate, and vote on the issue by majority.

Lachmon resigned in 1996, because he could not agree with the Wijdenbosch government. On 10 October 1996, Marijke Djwalapersad (BVD) was elected as Chair, becoming the first woman in Suriname's history to assume this office. On 24 July 2000, Djwalapersad was succeeded by Jagernath Lachmon, who remained in office until his death in 2001. His fellow party man Ramdien Sardjoe took his place. After the elections of 2005, Paul Somohardjo of Pertjajah Luhur (a party that was part of the New Front combination) wanted to become Vice President of Suriname. This did not seem feasible, since he was convicted in August 2003 for defamation, which resulted in a suspended two-month sentence and his removal as minister. Within the coalition was decided to make Ramdien Sardjoe vice president and Somohardjo Chairman of the National Assembly. On 30 June 2005, Somohardjo was elected to the proposed office with 29 out of 50 votes. Caprino Allendy (BEP/A-Combination) was elected as vice-Chairman, with the same number of votes. On 30 June 2010, Jennifer Simons of D√©si Bouterse's NDP/MC surprisingly won the office from Somohardjo, with 26 votes against 24 votes, and became the incumbent Chair of the Assembly. Ruth Wijdenbosch was elected as Vice Chair with 25 votes, one more than her rival, Anton Paal (PALU/MC). Remarkable is the fact that this is the first time that these offices are held by opposing politicians. It is also the first time that both offices are held by women.

Enron's original bankruptcy reorganization plan, presented in early 2002, would have created a company broadly similar to Prisma (known under the working name \\"OpCo Energy\\"), but including Portland General Electric and the energy trading business, both later divested separately. As one of the final steps in Enron's liquidation, following their 2001 bankruptcy, Prisma was sold to Ashmore Energy International Ltd., a unit of Ashmore Group Plc., in 2006. Prisma was structured as an 'offshore' United States corporation incorporated in the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands, but with its headquarters in Houston, Texas. It served as a holding company for 15 gas and electricity businesses. Its subsidiary, Prisma Energy International Services LLC, employed approximately 125 individuals, most at its headquarters in Houston, Texas.

The parish is located on the flood plain of one of the tributaries of the River Medway, 15 miles (24 km) to the east of Tunbridge Wells: the village is three miles (4.8 km) south of Headcorn. It is in a very rural part of Kent. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary. History Roman remains have been found near an old Jutish track which ran through the area, along which pigs were driven into the forest of Andreadsweald. The village itself is named in a charter of 804, and the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 839 relate that King Ethelwulf of Wessex gave the village land to St Augustines in Canterbury. Thomas Cromwell was given land in the village during the reign of King Henry VIII. Frittenden Church underwent extensive renovation in 1848 following a fire in the Church in 1790 when lightning struck the Church steeple. Rumours of the Frittenden Treacle Mines were started by locals in the 1930s at the expense of gullible Londoners who would tour the area in their newly acquired motor cars, eager to visit the source of much of the world's treacle. Frittenden Historical Society keeps a record of the history of the village and its inhabitants. It meets regularly in the Memorial Hall. Notable people The Rector of the parish church from 1900 to 1916 was Rupert Edward Inglis who was a former England rugby international. He was killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. His letters home to his wife from the front were published by his widow after the war. He is commemorated on the war memorial, and the lychgate at St Mary's church is dedicated to him. Admiral Sir Arthur Moore (1847‚Äì1934), the son of another rector of the parish, Edward Moore, was born at Frittenden in 1847 and was buried in the churchyard.

He was a Conservative Member of Parliament representing Peel from 1867 to 1872 and Cardwell from 1872 until his death. He was born in Blendecques, France in 1817. His father was a soldier in the 79th Highlanders who served in France during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1825, he came with his family to Kingston in Upper Canada. He studied at Kilkenny College in Ireland and Upper Canada College. He then studied law with Henry John Boulton. During the Upper Canada Rebellion, he served with the Queen's Rangers. In 1839, he was called to the bar in Upper Canada and entered a law practice in Toronto, Ontario. In 1846, he became a Queen's Counsel. Cameron also served on Toronto city council from 1846 to 1847, from 1851 to 1852 and 1854 to 1855. In 1860, he served as treasurer for the Law Society of Upper Canada. In 1869, he was also called to the Quebec bar. In 1846, he was chosen as solicitor general for Upper Canada and was elected to the 2nd Parliament of the Province of Canada in a by-election for Cornwall. In 1847, he was appointed to the Executive Council. He served in the Legislative Assembly until Confederation, except for the 4th and 6th parliaments, when he did not run. He supported representation by population and opposed the introduction of an elected Legislative Council. In 1856, he helped stir up controversy in the wake of the death of Robert Corrigan in Lotbini√®re, Quebec; this helped undermine the government of Allan MacNab which led to the rise of Sir John A. Macdonald as leader of the Conservatives. He supported Confederation but would have preferred a legislative union. He was elected to represent Peel in the House of Commons in 1867. In 1872, he ran in both Peel and Cardwell, being elected in the latter. He was a director of the Toronto and Guelph Railway, which was later absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway, helped found the Canada Life Assurance Company in 1847, was president of the Provincial Insurance Company and chairman of the board in Canada of the Edinburgh Life Insurance Company. He was also involved in the incorporation of a number of companies in the Toronto area including the Western Assurance Company in 1851 and the Toronto and Georgian Bay Canal Company in 1856. He suffered extensive financial losses near the end of 1857 as a result of a financial panic and economic depression; he promised to make good on his debts, which left him financially strained for the remainder of his life. He was a loyal follower of the Church of England and tried to defend its interests, including the revenue from the clergy reserves. He served on the council of Trinity College, an Anglican university at the time; he also was a professor of law at the college and served as chancellor from 1863 until his death. In 1856, he joined the Orange Order and served as grand master in Canada from 1859 to 1870. He suffered a heart attack and died while in Toronto in 1876.

It is edited by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the University of Texas at Austin. Each issue covers critical, theoretical, and historical topics relating to a particular theme.  History  The Velvet Light Trap was established as a quarterly journal in 1971 by film lovers in Madison, Wisconsin, including graduate students at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Russell Campbell served as editor-in-chief. In 1973, John Davis and Susan Dalton took over as editors, and Davis became the publisher. The journal‚Äôs name originates from a specific part of the film camera that keeps the light out where the magazine is attached. In its earliest years, The Velvet Light Trap served the local film community with a journal that emphasized American film history. It drew upon the talents of the graduate students at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison but it was not an official university publication. As the journal increased its circulation, it spread beyond the local community. By the mid 1970s, The Velvet Light Trap had established a reputation for scholarly research, with faculty from around the United States publishing articles in special issues such as \\"RKO Radio Pictures\\", \\"MGM\\", and \\"Warners Revisited\\". The Velvet Light Trap often attempted to define the styles and genres that distinguished individual Hollywood studios. Access to primary documents at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research led to special interests such as the blacklist period (1947-1960s). In 1989, the journal changed publishers, moving to the University of Texas Press. As part of the deal with the journal‚Äôs founders, UT graduate students would collectively co-edit the journal along with Madison students. With the move to the UT Press, the journal established an international advisory editorial board and instituted blind peer review. The biannual format of Madison publishing an issue in the fall and Texas publishing an issue in the spring still stands.

Ipstones is part of the Staffordshire Moorlands district; within the boundaries of the civil parish are the hamlets Foxt, Consall Forge and Bottomhouse. Ipstones Edge, to the north of the village, rises to and gives views for many miles around. Ipstones is not mentioned in the Domesday book and dates from around the 12th century. The majority of the houses and farms, barring modern development, are built from local sandstone. Two sections of the village are designated as Conservation Areas with several listed structures contained within them. Ipstones was served by a railway station opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 15 June 1905, on its line between Leekbrook Junction and Waterhouses. The station was closed to passengers on 30 September 1935. The buildings have been demolished but heritage trains of the Churnet Valley Railway now use the line again and there have been proposals to restore mineral trains to Caldon Low.

It publishes scholarly analyses of international and Hollywood cinema as well as independent film, including documentary and animation. The journal also revisits film classics; examines television and digital and online media; reports from international film festivals; reviews recent academic publications; and on occasion addresses installations, video games and emergent technologies. It welcomes established scholars as well as emergent voices that bring new perspectives to bear on visual representation as rooted in issues of diversity, race, lived experience, gender, sexuality, and transnational histories. Film Quarterly brings timely critical and intersectional approaches to criticism and analyses of visual culture. Since 2013, it has been edited by B. Ruby Rich. Working with her are associate editor Rebecca Prime, assistant editor Marc Francis, book reviews editor Carla Marcantonio, and Quorum editor Girish Shambu. Since 2015, Film Quarterly has received funding from the Ford Foundation‚Äôs JustFilms initiative to ‚Äúsupport the journal‚Äôs work in advancing criticism, analysis, and reporting with particular attention to social justice documentary and the interrogation of cinema practices across genres and platforms‚Äù with an emphasis on the representation of diversity and new voices.  History  Film Quarterly was first published in 1945 as Hollywood Quarterly, was renamed The Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television in 1951, and has operated under its current title since 1958. = Hollywood Quarterly (1945‚Äì1951) = According to former Film Quarterly editorial board member Brian Henderson, ‚ÄúHollywood Quarterly was launched in 1945 as a joint venture of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization and the University of California Press. The association began as a wartime collaboration between educators and media workers in response to social needs occasioned by the war.‚Äù Notable members of its first editorial board were playwright and screenwriter John Howard Lawson, psychologist Franklin Fearing, and writer-director Abraham Polonsky. = Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television (1951‚Äì1958) = After allegations in a House of Un- American Activities Committee hearing that Hollywood Quarterly had communist leanings, in 1951, the journal changed its name to Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television. This name change inaugurated the journal‚Äôs clear divorce from the Hollywood industry with which it had partnered for several years. The journal‚Äôs turn towards ‚Äúpolitically safe‚Äù work in the following years led to editorial discord and instability until August Frug√©, then-director of UC Press, changed the direction of the journal. Frug√© drew inspiration from the European film journals Sight and Sound and Cahiers du cin√©ma, noting in his book that, \\"there was no American review comparable to these two, intellectual but not academic and devoted to film as art and not as communication. By accident we found ourselves with the means to publish one‚Äîif we chose and if we knew how.\\" = Film Quarterly (1958- ) = Under the editorial guidance and visionary leadership of Ernest Callenbach, the journal rebranded itself to bridge film criticism and scholarship, and was renamed Film Quarterly in Fall 1958. Its initial advisory board was composed of, among others, film scholar Andries Deinum; Gavin Lambert, a former editor of Sight and Sound who was then a screenwriter in Hollywood; Albert Johnson, a Bay Area-based film programmer and critic; and Colin Young, who taught film at UCLA and later became the first director of the British National Film and Television School. Ernest Callenbach remained Film Quarterly‚Äôs editor until the Fall 1991 issue; he had overseen the production of 133 issues by the end of his appointment. Ann Martin, who had worked as an editor at American Film and The New Yorker, and on various film and video productions, served as the editor of Film Quarterly during 1991‚Äì2006. Rob White, who had edited the British Film Institute‚Äôs BFI Classics series, was in charge during 2006‚Äì2012. David Sterritt took over as guest editor for volume 66 in 2012‚Äì13. Immediately following its 40th anniversary, the University of California Press published a Film Quarterly anthology of its groundbreaking essays, co-edited by Brian Henderson and then- editor Ann Martin. Editorial board members Leo Baudry, Ernest Callenbach, Albert Johnson, Marsha Kinder, and Linda Williams all participated in the conceptualization of the volume. In 2002, Ann Martin and Eric Smoodin (who was then the Film, Media, and Philosophy Acquisitions Editor at UC Press) co- edited a volume of highlights from the journal‚Äôs Hollywood Quarterly (1945‚Äì1951) years. In 2013, film critic and historian B. Ruby Rich took over as editor for the journal. Rich's editorial vision has particularly emphasized work that engages with fresh approaches to film in a shifting digital media environment and a broadened view of cultural and critical approaches for both historical and contemporary work. Film Quarterly has emphasized the shifting forms and meanings the moving image has taken in the digital age and worked to expand its views of the field and the writers included in its pages. Special dossiers have focused on Joshua Oppenheimer‚Äôs ground-breaking The Act of Killing, the cinema of Richard Linklater, the significance of Brazilian documentarian Edouardo Coutinho, the legacy of Chantal Akerman, and a collection of Manifestos for the current era. Cover stories have focused on such films and television series as Melvin Van Peebles' The Watermelon Man, Louis Massiah's The Bombing of Osage Avenue, Jill Soloway's Transparent, and Kenya Barris's Black-ish. Film Quarterly aims to widens the scope of voices published in its pages, creates a shared discourse for divergent platforms, and broadens the canon beyond traditional auteurism.  Pauline Kael‚Äôs Involvement  For a brief time in the 1950s, Pauline Kael was considered for the role of editor. She was then a programmer at the Cinema Guild, a repertory movie house in Berkeley, CA. Frug√© and Kael did not share the same vision so the position was subsequently offered to Callenbach instead. Beginning in 1961, a regular feature, \\"Films of the Quarter,\\" appeared in which a group of well-known film critics‚ÄîDwight Macdonald, Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael, Jonas Mekas, and Gavin Lambert‚Äîdiscussed what they viewed as the best films of the prior three months. In the Spring 1963 issue, Pauline Kael famously attacked Andrew Sarris‚Äô auteur theory in her landmark article, \\"Circles and Squares.\\" In the Summer 1963 issue, Sarris responded to Kael‚Äôs critique with his own article, \\"The Auteur Theory and the Perils of Pauline.\\" Kael included many of her articles, film reviews, and other material published in FQ during 1961‚Äì65 in her first book, I Lost It at the Movies (1965).

She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  Biography  Bel≈°evica's father ≈Ωanis Bel≈°evics was a worker, and her mother Vera Bel≈°evica (maiden name Cƒ´rule) was a housewife. The family was relatively poor, as only one of the two spouses did paid work. Vizma's father had drinking problems, which aggravated when during the Great Depression he lost his job as a baker. Vizma Bel≈°evica was born on May 30, 1931, in prewar Riga, then the capital of democratic Latvia, where she spent most of her childhood. The city often is featured in her works, especially her most famous work‚Äîautobiographic trilogy \\"BILLE\\"‚Äî, but the time spent in Courland, on her relatives' small farm has also an important role in her poetry and writings. Her son KlƒÅvs Elsbergs was a famous Latvian poet in the 1980s and her second son JƒÅnis is a writer as well.  Recognition  Receiving the Nobel prize was her childhood dream; she, as a poor but bright girl, spent much of her time reading classical literature. Bel≈°evica's work has been recognised: on December 6, 1990, she was elected honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences; she has twice received the Spidola Award, which is the highest recognition in Latvian literature. Bel≈°evica has also received the highest award of the Latvian State, namely the Three Star Order.  Works  Vizma Bel≈°evica published her first poems in 1947; her first book of poetry appeared in 1955. Her most notable poetry collections are J≈´ra deg (The Sea is Burning, 1966), Gadu gredzeni (Annual Rings, 1969), MadarƒÅs (In My Lady's Bedstraw, 1976), Kamola tinƒìja (The Clew Winder, 1981), Dzeltu laiks (Autumn Time, 1987). Her short stories' collections are ƒ∂ikuraga stƒÅsti (Stories from Kikurags, 1965), Nelaime mƒÅjƒÅs (Misfortune at Home, 1979), LauztƒÅ sirds uz goda dƒìƒºa (Broken Heart on the Board of Honour, 1997). During the post-Soviet period, Bel≈°evica wrote three semi-autobiographical books ‚Äì stories about the girl Bille, following her life from the late 1930s, throughout the first year of Soviet occupation of Latvia (1940‚Äì41), the Nazi occupation (1941‚Äì45), and the first post-war years under Stalin's regime: Bille (Bille, 1992, 95), Bille un kar≈° (initial title: Bille dzƒ´vo tƒÅlƒÅk) (Bille and War, 1996), Billes skaistƒÅ jaunƒ´ba (The Wonderful Youth of Bille, 1999). Its first edition was published by the Latvian publisher Me≈æƒÅbele in 1992 in the United States and only in 1995 in Latvia. Now this trilogy has been recognized as one of the most important works of Latvian literature of all times. It has been translated into Swedish, but not in English. Bel≈°evica's poetry and fiction has been translated in about 40 languages. Within the Soviet Union of the 1960s‚Äì1980s, several books of her selected poetry were published in Russian, Belarusian and Armenian. Her poems were translated into English by Inara Cedrins for the anthology Contemporary Latvian Poetry published by the University of Iowa Press in 1983. From the 1980s onwards, Bel≈°evica has been regularly present on the Swedish literary scene, (translator Juris Kronbergs), books of her poetry and Bille stories have enjoyed immense critical success and wide readership there. Her Selected Poems have been published also in Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Selected Short Stories ‚Äì in Russia, Georgia and Germany.

At it is classified as a trekking peak. It contains three main summits: Mera North, ; Mera Central, ; and Mera South, , as well as a smaller \\"trekking summit\\", visible as a distinct summit from the south but not marked on most maps of the region. The height of Mera is often given as , and claimed to be the highest trekking peak. This figure actually points to nearby Peak 41, which was mistakenly named Mera in a list of Himalayan peaks, and the figures were copied to the official trekking peak list as they were, including the wrong location coordinates.Horrell, Mark. Islands in the Snow. Mountain Footsteps Press, 2018, pp.60-61.  History  The region was first explored extensively by British expeditions in the early 50s before and after the ascent of Everest. Members of those teams included Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Eric Shipton and George Lowe.Shipton, Eric. That Untravelled World. Hodder and Stoughton, 1969, pp.183-214 The first ascent of Mera Central was on May 20, 1953 by Col. Jimmy Roberts and Sen Tenzing (who was known by the nickname The Foreign Sportsman). Roberts was heavily involved in establishing the trekking industry in Nepal in the early 1960s.Isserman, Maurice & Weaver, Stewart.

Yale University Press, 2008, p.381 He was posthumously awarded the \\"Sagarmatha (Everest) National Award\\" by the government in May 2005. Mera North is believed to have first been climbed by the French climbers Marcel Jolly, G. Baus and L. Honills in 1975,O'Connor, Bill. The Trekking Peaks of Nepal. The Crowood Press, 1989, p.32 though some sources state that it was climbed on 29 October 1973 and the climbers included L. Limarques, Ang Lhakpa and two other Sherpas. In 1986 Mal Duff and Ian Tattersall made the first ascent of the south west pillar. The route is approximately in length and graded at ED inf. The approach to the base of the pillar is extremely exposed to serac fall.  Climbing routes  The standard route from the north involves high-altitude glacier walking. The west and south faces of the peak offer more difficult technical routes. Mera Peak provides the 360-degree panoramic views of 5 world highest mountains over 8000m: Mount Everest(8848m), Kangchenjunga(8586m), Lhotse(8516m), Makalu(8485m) and Cho Oyu(8201m) as well as many other peaks of Khumbu Region. For experienced climbers it is a technically straightforward ascent, the main hurdle being proper acclimatization to the high altitude. These reasons make Mera Peak a very popular destination, with many adventure tour companies offering guided trips to the mountain for clients with little or no mountaineering experience. All climbers are recommended to partake in preparative fitness and altitude training before attempting an ascent.

History Longannet was the remnant of three mines, established in the 1960s. Built on the north side of the Firth of Forth, east of Kincardine, it connected with the Bogside, Castlehill and Solsgirth Collieries, forming a single, five miles long, tunnel. They provided fuel for the nearby, 2,400MW Longannet Power Station. The Bogside Colliery closed in the 1980s, and by the early 1990s, the Castlehill and Solsgirth coal reserves were exhausted. Production continued from the Castlebridge area. On privatisation of the coal industry, the complex passed into the ownership of Mining Scotland and later Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Ltd. In the late 1990s, new \\"roadway\\" tunnels were driven to access a coal seam beneath the Forth, downstream of the Kincardine Bridge. When production from Castlebridge ceased, in 2000, the northern side of the complex was sealed off and flooded. Dams were constructed, isolating the old workings from the active Kincardine working. In March 2002, millions of gallons of water flooded into the underground workings. The 15 people below ground at the time were in another part of the mine and all were evacuated safely. Shortly after the flooding, Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Limited, went into receivership. It became clear that no new operator would take over the mine, and all the pumps were switched off, allowing further flooding. Without access, the true cause of the flooding could not be conclusively determined by the investigation. It was concluded that one of the dams, or the surrounding strata, had probably failed, but the exact reason was not known. The design margins for the dams appeared to be adequate. Before the site's complete flattening in 2019 the multiple buildings on the site lay derelict with most of their interiors undamaged and untouched since its abandonment in late 2002 after the liquidation of Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Ltd. The site now lies to the North East of a Specialist Sand Facility. Longannet was the last deep mine of any significance in Scotland and its closure effectively ended underground coal mining in Scotland. As of 2008, opencast coal mining continued in Scotland, with 51.4% of Great Britain's opencast coal mines (18 out of 35 mines) and 60.1% of the saleable production by weight (5.68m tonnes out of 9.45m tonnes).

It is published monthly in Phoenix by a unit of the Arizona Department of Transportation.  Background  The magazine began in July 1921 by the Arizona Highway Department (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) as a 10-page pamphlet designed to promote \\"the development of good roads throughout the state.\\" Publication of the pamphlet ended on December 30, 1922, after nine issues. The publication was relaunched on April 15, 1925, as a regular magazine. In addition to the engineering articles, cartoons and travelogues were also included in the early issues. Over the next two decades the magazine reduced, and then stopped, inclusion of the road engineering articles and dedicated itself to the present format of travel tales, historical stories, and humor about the state of Arizona (including stories about Arizona's contribution to the history of the Old West), always enhanced by the now-legendary photography. This transition began largely under the watch of Raymond Carlson, who began as editor in 1938 and served until 1971; under his leadership the magazine stopped accepting advertisements and developed the editorial tone and style for which it is best known to the present day. Arizona Highways has been well known for documenting the Native American people of Arizona and the Southwest, especially the Navajo, the Hopi and Apache; this includes stories and photos of life on the reservations, and centuries-old Native ceremonies such as the \\"sunrise dance\\" of the Apache. (Future U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater first became known in the late 1930s for his photographs of Native American life in Arizona, as well as other scenic landscapes such as the Grand Canyon, published in the pages of Arizona Highways.) From time to time, special issues would be devoted to major places of interest in Arizona, such as the Phoenix and Tucson areas (as well as each of Arizona's major state-run universities), and the Grand Canyon. In selected issues, destinations in the Southwest outside of Arizona have been featured, including Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah. Several issues have been devoted exclusively to Mexico, documenting places of historical interest and natural beauty (including the border town of Nogales), accessible to Arizonans via a relatively short drive south of the border. In the mid-1960s, there were reports that Arizona Highways had been designated as \\"subversive literature\\", despite being non-political, and subsequently banned by the authorities of various countries in the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany and the Soviet Union. Arizona Highways states that the reason the magazine was banned was because the magazine was believed to propagandize life in America. Arizona Highways promoted the art of Ettore \\"Ted\\" DeGrazia, showcasing his artwork especially in their December issues. Beginning in the 1950s, the December issue became known as \\"Arizona's Christmas card to the world\\" as it was for many years the only issue of the year produced in full color, allowing for many dramatic and awe-inspiring color shots of the Arizona landscape, from the desert regions of the central and southern portions of the state to the snow-covered pine forests of Flagstaff and other northern areas. Arizona Highways began printing all issues in full color by the mid-1980s. In 1946, photographer Ansel Adams started to contribute prints for the magazine. Photographs include \\"Arches, North Court, Mission San Xavier del Bac, Tucson, Arizona, 1968\\" and \\"Saguaro Cactus, Sunrise, Arizona, 1942\\". Since this time, the magazine has become known for its photography, often compared favorably with that of National Geographic and similar travel magazines. Three generations of the Muench family contributed landscape photographs to Arizona Highways: Josef Muench, an immigrant from Bavaria, whose first photos appeared in the late 1930s; son David Muench, who assisted his father as a teenager (his first of many Arizona Highways covers appeared in January 1955 when he was eighteen, and whose style became a standard followed by several later photographers for the magazine); and David's son Marc Muench, who became a fixture in Arizona Highways' pages starting in the 1980s. Pulitzer Prize- winning photojournalist Jack Dykinga has been a frequent contributor, as has been Jerry Jacka, known for not only landscapes but for his photos of the historic and contemporary art (and people) of Arizona's Native American communities. Five separate issues of Arizona Highways have been devoted entirely to Jacka's work. Today, Arizona Highways monthly circulation surpasses 200,000 copies, with readers in 50 U.S. states and in two-thirds of the world's countries. Although known primarily for its magazine, Arizona Highways also publishes books, calendars, and other Arizona-related products.

He was a socialist leader who dedicated his life to the liberation of the Kenyan people and became independent Kenya's first martyr in 1965. Early years Pinto was born in Nairobi on 31 March 1927 to a Kenyan Asian family of Konkani Goan Catholic descent. Born to immigrant Goan parents hailing from the Indian states of Goa and Maharashtra, his father was an official in the colonial government of Kenya while his mother was a housewife. At age eight, he was sent to India for his education and spent the next nine years there, passing his matriculation exams at St. Joseph's High School, Arpora and then studying science at Karnatak College, Dharwar for two years before joining the Indian Air Force in 1944 as an apprentice ground engineer. He then took up a job in the Posts and Telegraph office in Bombay, participated in a general strike and became a founding member of the Goa National Congress whose aim was the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule. When only seventeen, he started an agitation in Bombay against the Portuguese colonial occupation of Goa. His political activism soon made it necessary for him to return to Kenya to avoid being arrested and deported to the Tarrafal concentration camp in Cape Verde. Political career In 1949 Pinto returned to Kenya and, after a succession of clerical jobs, became involved in local politics aimed at overthrowing British colonial rule in Kenya. He turned to journalism and worked with the Colonial Times and the Daily Chronicle. In 1954, five months after his marriage to Emma Dias, he was rounded up in the notorious Operation Anvil and spent the next four years in detention on Manda Island. He was kept in confinement from early 1958 until October 1959 at Kabarnet. In 1960 he founded the Kenya African National Union (KANU) newspaper Sauti Ya KANU, and later, Pan African Press, of which he subsequently became Director and Secretary. Pinto played an active role in campaigning for KANU during the 1961 elections which it won. In 1963 he was elected a Member of the Central Legislative Assembly and in July 1964 was appointed a Specially Elected Member of the House of Representatives. He worked to establish the Lumumba Institute in 1964 to train KANU party officials. Assassination In Nairobi, on 24 February 1965, Pinto was shot at very close range in the driveway while waiting for the gate to open.\\"Pinto, Pio Gama\\", in Historical Dictionary of Kenya, Robert M. Maxon and Thomas P. Ofcansky, eds. (Rowman & Littlefield, 2014) pp287-288 He was with his daughter in his car at the time of his killing. The police set out to find three gunmen in connection with the murder. Kisilu Mutua and Chege Thuo, teenagers at the time, were arrested on the day of the murder. Kisilu and Chege informed the C.I.D. that they were hired by Ochola Mak‚ÄôAnyengo, the secretary general of the Kenya Petroleum Oil workers union, to frighten Pinto ostensibly on account of his interfering with the union. Mak‚ÄôAnyengo was arrested following these accusations. At the police lineup however, the accused affirmed that Ochola Mak‚ÄôAnyengo resembled the man who hired them, but he was not the actual culprit who had identified himself as Mak'Anyengo. Ochola Mak‚ÄôAnyengo was cleared of any involvement and released. After the case was heard in court, Thuo was acquitted, but Mutua was given the death sentence. This sentence was later reduced to life in prison following an appeal. Report of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission 2013.

Daily Nation, 19th June 2000 Pinto became the first Kenyan politician to be assassinated after Independence. At the time of his assassination, Pinto was 38. He was survived by his wife, Emma and his three daughters Linda, Malusha and Tereshka. Two years after the assassination, Emma and her daughters migrated to Canada. Different theories have been forwarded about the assassination with some suggesting that Pinto was killed by Jomo Kenyatta's men and others seeing Pinto's assassination as the extermination of an avowed Communist with links to the Mozambican liberation movement by neocolonial forces. An article published in Transition magazine in 1966 noted that a letter was circulated amongst Members of Parliament after Pinto‚Äôs murder warning of the risks of cooperating with the eastern bloc. Bildad Kaggia was quoted saying that Pinto‚Äôs killing was not an ordinary murder but a political one. Despite the wide perception that this was a political assassination, the police investigation treated the murder as not political. Freedom and suffering.

Posthumous commemoration After his death, Pio Pinto's colleagues established a Pinto Trust Fund to help his widow and family to which leftist governments such as those of China and Tanzania contributed. In September 1965, Mrs. Emma Gama Pinto was invited to Santiago, Chile, to receive a posthumous prize awarded to her husband by the International Organisation of Journalists for his contribution in journalism to the liberation of African countries from foreign domination and exploitation.

For example, a book's author may sell a license to a publisher in return for 5% royalties on sales of the book and a $5,000 advance against those royalties.

It is down the line from and is situated between and stations. It is managed by Great Western Railway, which also operates most of the trains that call. South Western Railway operate a limited number of services. History The station was opened on 31 August 1840 with the completion of the Great Western Railway line between Bristol and Bath. It was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale on 1 February 1925 with the opening of the Fry's chocolate factory at Somerdale, which had its own siding. The station was rebuilt in 1931 to accommodate longer trains bringing in workers who had transferred from a factory in Bristol belonging to the company. Between 1841 and 1851 it had the possibly unique distinction, for a railway station, of featuring a Roman Orpheus mosaic set into a floor. This had been found at Newton St Loe, and is now in Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.\\"Roman Orpheus mosaic to be displayed at Bristol museum\\" , BBC, 2013 Keynsham is the nearest station to the village of Saltford, which until 1970 had its own station. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. By this time many workers had relocated to Keynsham, or commuted by car. The factory had its own rail system which was connected to the mainline. The connection to Fry's chocolate factory was taken out of use on 26‚Äì27 July 1980. The trackbed of this can still be seen opposite the entrance to the station car park. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council. The rebuilding provided a new brick built shelter on platform 2, a new footbridge and the enlargement of the car park. Further construction work began in mid-2009. In 2011 a campaign group was formed to gain improved access for the disabled at the station. Recently a new disabled access ramp was built which provides wheelchair access between the footbridge and Platform 1. In addition to this, dot matrix display boards have been put up on both platforms. These displays are accompanied by audio announcements. Accidents and incidents *On 18 March 1849, a passenger train became divided approaching Keynsham. The rear portion then ran into the front portion when the latter stopped at the station. One person was injured. *On 20 January 1853 a luggage train was derailed near Keynsham due to an axle failure on one of the carriages. *On 7 June 1865, a passenger train ran into the rear of another near Keynsham.

Keynsham is also a stop on a Parliamentary train that runs on weekdays from Bristol Parkway to Bath Spa, via Bristol West Curve. It does not call at Bristol Temple Meads. Electrification As part of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line, the line through Keynsham closed for 1 week in April 2016 so that Network Rail could carry out preparation work for the installation of the overhead wires. This involved the lowering of the track under the road bridge and the replacement of the canopy on platform 1. Also the brick shelter on the Bath (up) platform was enlarged.

It is a bicameral body, comprising two chambers: *Meshrano Jirga () or the House of Elders: an upper house with 102 seats. *Wolesi Jirga () or the House of the People: a lower house with 250 seats. According to Chapter Five of the Constitution of Afghanistan, \\"the National Assembly of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as the highest legislative organ is the manifestation of the will of its people and represents the whole nation. Every member of the National Assembly takes into judgment the general welfare and supreme interests of all people of Afghanistan at the time of casting their vote\\". The National Assembly is located next to the famous Darul Aman Palace in Darulaman, which is the southwestern section of Kabul where many important national institutions are found. The current building for the Assembly was built by India as part of its contribution in the rebuilding of Afghanistan. It was inaugurated in late 2015 by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his guest Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. The current Parliament was inaugurated on April 26, 2019 after being sworn in by Ghani.http://prod.tolonews.com/afghanistan/ghani-inaugurates- parliamenthttps://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/26/world/asia/ap-as- afghanistan.html Duties of the National Assembly Ratification, modification or abrogation of laws or legislative decrees; Approval of social, cultural, economic as well as technological development programs; Approval of the state budget as well as permission to obtain or grant loans; Creation, modification and or abrogation of administrative units; Ratification of international treaties and agreements, or abrogation of membership of Afghanistan in them; Other authorities enshrined in this Constitution. The Wolesi Jirga (House of People) The Wolesi Jirga has 250 seats with members directly elected by the people. Sixty-eight women were elected to the seats reserved under the Constitution, while 17 of them have been elected in their own rights. Each province was given proportionate representation in the Wolesi Jirga according to its population. Each member of the Wolesi Jirga will enjoy a five-year term. An aspiring candidate for the Wolesi Jirga must fulfill the following criteria: *Be at least 25 years of age *Be a citizen of Afghanistan *Be registered as a voter *Be running as a representative in only one province *Pay a registration fee of 15,000 Afghanis (approximately US$300) which will be refunded provided the candidate wins at least three percent (3%) of the vote *Submit a nomination form along with photocopies of 500 voter ID cards supporting the candidacy In addition, no candidate can have been charged with crimes against humanity. The Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders) The inside of the old Parliament building (2006). The Meshrano Jirga consists of a mixture of appointed and elected members (total 102 members). Sixty-eight members were selected by 34 directly elected Provincial Councils, and 34 were appointed by the President. President Karzai's appointments were vetted by an independent UN sponsored election board and included 17 women (50%), as required by the Constitution. Each provincial council has elected one council member to serve in the Jirga (34 members), also each district council (34 members). Representatives of provincial councils will serve a term of four years, while representatives of district councils will serve a term of three years. Sebghatulla Mojadeddi was appointed President of Meshrano Jirga. An aspiring candidate for the Meshrano Jirga must fulfill the following criteria: *Be at least 35 years of age *Be a citizen of Afghanistan In addition, no potential member of the Meshrano Jirga can have been charged with crimes against humanity.  Construction of the new Parliament building  The new Afghan Parliament building The foundation stone for the new Afghan Parliament was laid in August 2005 by the last king of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah, in the presence of Hamid Karzai and Manmohan Singh. India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD) was the consultant for the project and the contract was awarded to an Indian infrastructure company in 2008. The new Parliament building is corralled in a 100-acre plot in the famous Darulaman section of Kabul. It sits next to historical landmarks such as Amanullah Khan's Palace and the Queen's Palace. The construction work on the $220 million dollar building was initially slated to be complete by 2012, in 36 months. The deadline, however, was pushed back due to challenging work conditions, shortage of skilled workforce and precarious security environment. More than 500 laborers had worked on the building, most of them Indian nationals. The main attraction of the building is a bronze dome of 32 meter diameter and 17.15 meter height is considered to be the largest dome in Asia. The big dome will cover the assembly hall and the small dome will be over the entrance lobby. In front of the building, there is a water body with nine cascading fountains. Inside the building, a 20-feet fountain, made of green marble imported from Indian city of Udaipur, has been installed. On December 25, 2015, during a state visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the new Parliament building was inaugurated along with President Ashraf Ghani. Ghani tweeted: \\"Pleased to welcome PM Modi to Kabul. Though, India & Afghanistan need no introduction, we are bound by a thousand ties... We have stood by each other in the best and worst of times.\\" See also *Afghan Youth Parliament *Politics of Afghanistan *Afghan parliamentary election, 2018 *List of legislatures by country *Afghanistan‚ÄìIndia relations References  External links  *Official Website of Wolesi Jirga *Official Website of Meshrano Jirga Afghanistan Afghanistan ","title":"National Assembly (Afghanistan)"},{"id":"4014192","text":"Uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, or UROD) is an enzyme () that in humans is encoded by the UROD gene.

According to historical records, there were twenty one rulers in this dynasty, but the line is obscure and the names of some intervening rulers are not known.

The cells that result from elongation without division have multiple chromosomal copies. In the absence of antibiotics or other stressors, filamentation occurs at a low frequency in bacterial populations (4-8% short filaments and 0-5% long filaments in 1- to 8-hour cultures), the increased cell length protecting bacteria from protozoan predation and neutrophil phagocytosis by making ingestion of the cells more difficult. Filamentation is also a virulence factor thought to protect bacteria from antibiotics, and is associated with other aspects of bacterial virulence such as biofilm formation. The number and length of filaments within a bacterial population increases when the bacteria are treated with various chemical and physical agents (eg. DNA synthesis- inhibiting antibiotics, UV light). Some of the key genes involved in filamentation in E. coli include sulA and minCD. Filament formation =Antibiotic-induced filamentation= Some peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors (eg. cefuroxime, ceftazidime) induce filamentation by inhibiting the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) responsible for crosslinking peptidoglycan at the septal wall (eg. PBP3 in E. coli and P. aeruginosa). Because the PBPs responsible for lateral wall synthesis are relatively unaffected by cefuroxime and ceftazidime, cell elongation proceeds without any cell division and filamentation is observed. DNA synthesis-inhibiting and DNA damaging antibiotics (eg. metronidazole, mitomycin C, the fluoroquinolones, novobiocin) induce filamentation via the SOS response. The SOS response inhibits septum formation until the DNA can be repaired, this delay stopping the transmission of damaged DNA to progeny. Bacteria inhibit septation by synthesizing protein SulA, an FtsZ inhibitor that halts Z-ring formation, thereby stopping recruitment and activation of PBP3. If bacteria are deprived of the nucleobase thymine by treatment with folic acid synthesis inhibitors (eg. trimethoprim), this also disrupts DNA synthesis and induces SOS-mediated filamentation. Direct obstruction of Z-ring formation by SulA and other FtsZ inhibitors (eg. berberine) induces filamentation too. Some protein synthesis inhibitors (eg. kanamycin), RNA synthesis inhibitors (eg. bicyclomycin) and membrane disruptors (eg. daptomycin, polymyxin B) cause filamentation too, but these filaments are much shorter than the filaments induced by the above antibiotics. =Ultraviolet light-induced filamentation= UV light damages bacterial DNA and induces filamentation via the SOS response. =Nutrition- induced filamentation= Nutritional changes may also cause bacterial filamentation. For example, if bacteria are deprived of the nucleobase thymine by starvation, this disrupts DNA synthesis and induces SOS-mediated filamentation.

He was educated at St Ninian's School, Kirkintilloch, St. Mary's College, Blairs and St. Peter's College, Cardross. He was ordained priest on 29 June 1960 at the Pontifical Scots College in Rome. He received his Ph.D. in 1964 from the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome. He was private secretary to the Archbishop of Glasgow from 1964-65. He was assistant priest at St. Robert Bellarmine, Pollok, Glasgow (1965‚Äì67) and at St. Joseph's, Helensburgh (1967‚Äì1972). He was on staff at St. Peter's College, Cardross (1967‚Äì1974). He served on the staff of the Episcopal Vicar for the Lay Apostolate from 1974‚Äì83. He was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop on 5 May 1977, aged 39. He was ordained bishop by Thomas Joseph Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow, in St. Francis' Church, Gorbals, Glasgow, on 31 May 1977. He was translated to the Diocese of Motherwell on 13 May 1983, aged 45. Bishop Devine handed his resignation to the Vatican on 7 August 2012, his 75th birthday, as required by canon law, this was accepted on 30 May 2013 at which point Bishop Joseph Toal, Bishop of Argyll and the Isles was appointed apostolic administrator. The Diocese of Motherwell was a Sede Vacante until his successor, Bishop Joseph Toal, was appointed by Pope Francis on 29 April 2014 with his installation taking place on 23 June 2014 where Bishop Devine handed over the diocesan Crozier to the new bishop. Joseph Devine died Thursday 23 May 2019 after a short stay in Wishaw General Hospital.

Public views on Parishes In February 2008 he called for an audit of police officers to combat sectarian discrimination against Catholics.Scots police face sectarian audit, Jason Allardyce, The Times, 27 February 2008, retrieved 3 July 2009 The discrimination includes denying promotion to Catholics above a certain rank. Anti-sectarianism charity Nil by Mouth supported the call. Public views on homosexuality In March 2008, as part of a public lecture on Sectarianism and Secularism, Devine drew controversy when he spoke about a perceived \\"gay lobby\\" attending Holocaust memorials \\"to create for themselves the image of a group of people under persecution.\\" He identified this as part of a \\"giant conspiracy\\". Devine explained, \\"Like Mel Gibson, who said, 'I'm going to pick a fight', so am I...The homosexual lobby has been extremely effective in aligning itself with minority groups. It is ever present at the service each year for the Holocaust memorial, as if to create for themselves the image of a group of people under persecution.\\"Catholic bishop hits out at 'gay conspiracy' to destroy Christianity, Tristran Stuart-Robertson, The Scotsman, 13 March 2008, retrieved 3 July 2009Bishop criticises gay community, BBC News, 13 March 2008 Devine went on to criticise the decision to honour Sir Ian McKellen for his work for equality and, by way of illustrating the advances made in equality for gays, pointed out that Oscar Wilde had been jailed for homosexual offences. He also took the opportunity to give advice to parents of gay children. \\"This must be a nightmare moment for any parent. I would try to handle it with a degree of compassion. But I would not tolerate that kind of behaviour. I would not condemn but I would not tolerate it.\\" Critics of Bishop Devine cite that between 5,000 and 15,000 gay men were held in concentration camps by the Nazis as members of an \\"anti-social group.\\" Historians estimate that 60% of them died while incarcerated. In 2007, Bishop Devine stated that he would close the Roman Catholic adoption agencies rather than help same-sex couples to adopt children, and earlier in the year suggested that homosexual men and women would not be fit to teach in classrooms. Financial controversies In November 2008, Bishop Devine attracted controversy when he demolished his home in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire in order to build a new residence at an estimated cost of ¬£650,000.Grand Devine's, Charles Lavery, Sunday Mail, 23 November 2008 This occasioned criticism from many among his flock in the diocese, and from beyond. His purchase of the now demolished house also caused controversy in the tabloid press, who claimed that he had considered the acquisition of a property with a swimming pool. This was denied by Bishop Devine. Sexual abuse scandal In April 2013, The Observer alleged that as Bishop of Motherwell, Devine had protected priests who had sexually abused children and tried to silence or discredit their victims. In 2016 Fr. John B. Farrell, a Retired priest of the Diocese of Motherwell, the last Head teacher at St Ninian's Orphanage, Falkland, Fife, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. His colleague Paul Kelly, a retired teacher from Portsmouth, was given ten years, both were convicted of the physical and sexual abuse of boys between the years 1979 and 1983. More than 100 charges involving 35 boys were made. Farrell and Kelly were members of the Irish Christian Brothers when the crimes were committed at the orphanage which closed in 1983. Although Farrell was not an ordained priest at the time when these specific offences were committed an initial police investigation between 2000 and 2002 resulted in no charges. During this period Farrell was in active ministry in the Diocese of Motherwell which at the time was led by Bishop Joseph Devine.

The National Assembly is a unicameral body, with 220 members: 130 members elected by proportional representation and 90 members elected by provincial districts. The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has held a majority in the Assembly since independence. Due to the Angolan Civil War, elections were delayed for years until they were eventually held in September 2008. The first elections under the new constitution were held in 2012, after a new constitution was adopted in 2010, increasing considerably the power of the President, and diminishing that of the National Assembly as well as that of the judiciary. Jurisdiction The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch comprises a 220-seat unicameral legislature elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies. On account of civil wars from independence, political power has been concentrated in the presidency. There are various temporary and permanent committees in the Assembly that help in the operational and administrative functions of the Assembly. Selection of members The Unicameral Parliament of Angola was scheduled was originally constituted with 229 elected members. for a period of three years after the elections. All Angolan citizens with 18 years of age were eligible to cast their vote. Citizens who were members of factional groups, had criminal record and who had not rehabilitated were barred from exercising their voting rights. The representatives of the provincial assemblies formed a college and they elected the representatives of the House of Parliament. The candidates were expected to be answerable to the citizens in public meetings, with their candidature approved by a majority in the province where they were getting nominated. A constitutional amendment on 19 August 1980 indicated that the Council formed during interim would be replaced by a national people's assembly and there would be 18 elected assemblies. Premises The original building of the National Assembly from 1980, also called People's assembly was located in Est√∫dio/Restaura√ß√£o Cinema in urban district of Ingombota. The new building inaugurated on 9 November 2015 was initiated on 15 October 2009, while the construction started on 17 May 2010. It is a part of the Political Administrative Centre covering an area of 72,000 Sq.m and a built area of 54,000 sq.m. The Centre accommodates Presidential Palace, the Palace of Justice, the Defence Ministry, Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the Episcopal Palace and the premises of the former National Assembly headquarters. The New Assembly has 4,600 seats overall with 1,200 in meeting rooms. The compound has four blocks each with six floors, a basement parking that can accommodate 494 vehicles, out of which 34 is reserved for VIPs. The construction was carried out by Portuguese company Teixeira Duarte under the supervision of Special Works Office of the Government of Angola. The building was inaugurated by Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos on 10 November 2015. Performance of political parties Jose Eduardo dos Santos won the 1980 and 1986 elections and became the first elected President of the country. At the time, the country was a one-party state known as the Angolan People's Republic, with the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola - Party of Labour (MPLA-PT) as the sole legal party. As a result, most candidates were members of the party, and two-thirds were re-nominated from 1980 elections in the 1986 elections. The civil war continued with UNITA fighting against the MLPA, with both parties taking international support. There was a cease-fire agreement during 1989, with the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, but it collapsed soon. As a part of its peace efforts, MLPA dropped its theme of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and moved over to democratic socialism. During May 1991, Dos Santos and Savimbi signed a multiparty democracy agreement in Lisbon. Dos Santos won the 1992, 2008 and 2012 elections as well in the Presidency elections, but different parties started performing. During the 1992 elections, when the first multi- party elections were held, UNITA secured 34.1 per cent vote in the assembly and won 70 seats. But during the 2008 and 2012, their win was reduced to 16 and 32 seats respectively, while the ruling MPLA won 191 and 175 seats respectively.

Pine-Sol was based on pine oil when it was created in 1929 and during its rise to national popularity in the 1950s. However, as of 2016, Pine-Sol products sold in stores no longer contain pine oil to reduce costs.  History  Pine-Sol detergent was invented by Harry A. Cole of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1929. In 1948, entrepreneur Robert Earnest \\"Dumas\\" Milner acquired Magnolia Chemical, the Jackson, Mississippi, supplier of Pine-Sol. Milner put Howard S. Cohoon in charge of the firm which had six employees: three salesmen and three who produced the product. In the following five years Cohoon turned the company into a multi-million dollar operation selling 20 million bottles throughout the US and 11 other nations. Cohoon modernized the operation from manual bottling and labeling to full automation. According to Cohoon, at that time pine oil was produced from old yellow pine tree stumps which were previously regarded as worthless. After Pine-Sol went national, Milner Company began a national radio advertising campaign starting with the Robert Q. Lewis show in 1952. By 1955 the Milner company had purchased Perma-Starch, of Illiopolis, Illinois, and by 1959 Milner had grown to a $1.5 million daytime TV advertising package and a $100,000 radio buy shared between Pine-Sol and Perma-Starch. In January 1956, the Federal Trade Commission ordered Milner Company to cease and desist an advertising campaign that related to the false claims regarding the effectiveness of Pine-Sol compared to other pine oil containing products. Milner Company had previously agreed to cease and desist several other false claims about germicidal and bactericidal properties of Pine-Sol in March 1951. In February 1963, the Dumas Milner Company, including Pine-Sol facilities in Jackson, MS and Perma-Starch plant in Illiopolis, IL, was taken over by Wayne, New Jersey based American Cyanamid for stock valued at $17 million. Howard S. Cohoon was to remain in charge of the division. The Pine-Sol brand was acquired by Clorox from American Cyanamid's Shulton Group in 1990. The 2005 version of the original 8% to 10% pine oil based cleaner was acidic (pH 3‚Äì4) and could be used to remove bacteria from household surfaces. However, some of the products now contain bases (pH 10‚Äì11). There was also a dispute between Clorox and Reckitt Benckiser over potential consumer confusion regarding the fact that both Lysol and Pine Sol both end in \\"sol\\" and are used for cleaning. The issues spawned negotiations, agreements and lawsuits among several involved companies over the years from the 1960s to late 1990s.  Formulation  Although the original Pine-Sol formulation was pine oil-based, today the cleaners sold under the Pine-Sol brand contain no pine oil. In 2006, The Clorox Company's product line included \\"Clorox Commercial Pine-Sol Brand Cleaner\\", with the same ingredients and concentrations as \\"Original Pine-Sol Brand Cleaner 1.\\" In 2008, the material safety data sheet for the \\"Original Pine-Sol Brand Cleaner 1\\" formulation listed 8‚Äì12% pine oil, 3-7% alkyl alcohol ethoxylates, 1-5% sodium petroleum sulfonate and 1-5% isopropyl alcohol. In January 2013, Clorox began making a product called Original Pine- Sol Multi-Surface Cleaner which included glycolic acid while lacking any pine oil. In January 2014, Clorox announced that Pine-Sol products would no longer contain pine oil, due to pine oil's limited supply and increased cost. In response to consumer requests for the original formula, Clorox made available a product containing 8.75% Pine oil to online purchasers, but said it would not be sold in stores. As of 2018, Pine-Sol can be found on store shelves with an ingredient label stating \\"Contains Pine Oil\\" but this is not listed as an active ingredient. Pine oil in modern Pine-Sol seems to be added for fragrance only, as the product still uses glycolic acid as the sole active ingredient. According to 1950s Milner executive Howard S. Cohoon, producer of Pine-sol, pine oil is only formed in large stumps from cut-over timber that has remained in the ground for \\"at least 20 years.\\" It is not found in live pine trees. When asked about the risk of running out, Cohoon estimated in 1954 that there was \\"enough to last for another 35 years.\\" He was not worried about a shortage as he claimed pine oil could be produced synthetically.

He is married to Ya√´l Barroz, a fellow game designer, with whom he has two children. He is perhaps best known for Alone in the Dark, a game that established many conventions of the survival horror genre. Raynal also has a cult following for his Little Big Adventure series. Raynal and other former Adeline members have repeatedly told fans that creating the third installment is made difficult by having to license or reacquire the rights to the franchise, which currently belong to Delphine Software International. However, Raynal has hinted that his current company, Ludo√Ød, which Raynal owns jointly with his wife, is attempting to negotiate the rights for a game to be called Little Big Adventure 3: Genesis of the Stellar Entity, and at least one sketch, by Didier Chanfray, related to development of the title has been leaked to the public, later to be confirmed as appurtenant by Raynal. Career Frederick Raynal was born in 1966 in Brive-la-Gaillarde, Corr√®ze (France).The Road of Trials. Sanqualis. pp. 24-37. 8 September 2005. Beginning in his high school years, Raynal made early LED games including Laser (1979) for the ZX81. Shifting to software programming and working at his father's computer shop, Raynal's first commercial game, Robix 500 (1983), sold around 80 copies. During his time working here, Raynal also designed a suite of Minitel emulators: Minitelec (1986) for the Amstrad 464 through 6128 (Minitelec and Transmitelec), the Amstrad CPC6128 (Servitelec), and the PC-1512 (Minitelec Pro).http://ludoid.fr/ludographie.htm , Retrieved on October 21, 2010 He also produced graphics for the game PopCorn (1988), which was a moderate commercial success. After joining the infant Infogrames he ported Alpha Waves (1990), a game which pushed new boundaries in gaming and is considered the first true 3D platform game. The port, from Atari ST to DOS, was actually a complete rewrite in C of the original Motorola 68000 assembly language code written by Christophe de Dinechin, after Raynal convinced Infogrames to make an exception to their policy of not porting assembly-language games. Convinced by his experience with Alpha Waves that the time was ripe for 3D graphics,Interview with Frederick Raynal from Adventure EuropeAlone in the Dark retrospective from IGN he and his team soon went on to produce Alone in the Dark (1992), and worked on parts of the direct sequel (Alone in the Dark 2) before leaving the company. Alone in the Dark was a major contributor to the growth and success of Infogrames, and has since come to be widely regarded as a forefather of the survival horror genre.Leigh Alexander, Inside the Making of Alone in the Dark, Gamasutra, March 9, 2012Fahs, Traves. Alone in the Dark Restrospective, IGN, June 23, 2008 More importantly to Raynal himself, he became romantically involved with the game's graphic artist, Ya√´l Barroz, who gave birth to his first child shortly before Alone in the Dark was released. Raynal formed Adeline Software International in 1993 with several former Infogrames members. With this new team, Raynal produced Little Big Adventure (1994), Time Commando (1996), and Little Big Adventure 2 (1997). He was also given special thanks on the PlayStation port of Fade to Black (1995). Adeline was purchased by Sega in 1997 and became No Clich√©. With No Clich√©, Raynal and his team produced Toy Commander (1999), and Toy Racer (2000) both for Sega's Dreamcast system, and also helped Raster Productions into coding localisation for the European release of its Dreamcast Quake III Arena port (2000). During this time No Clich√© also produced a spin- off entitled Toy Commander: Christmas Surprise (2000) as a free bonus with issue #10 of OD Magazine. For a time Raynal was also working on a survival horror game Agartha, which was cancelled due to Sega's decision to stop development on the Dreamcast. No Clich√© remained together for a little while after the cancellation, attempting to create a PC port of Toy Commander. However, the group split before it could be finished. Raynal went on to form F4-Toys (later F4) with Bruno Heintz where he began work on an action adventure game Trium Planeta. The game was to follow the style of Little Big Adventure, but was cancelled after a few months. Raynal also worked briefly at Little World Studio before forming his current company, Ludo√Ød. In 1997, Raynal was credited in the short film, Double Jeu. On March 13, 2006, Raynal along with Shigeru Miyamoto and Michel Ancel were knighted by French Minister of Culture and Communication, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, as Knights of Arts and Literature. It was the first time that video game developers were honored this distinction. Later, Raynal was involved as a consultant in the design of Soul Bubbles, a game for the Nintendo DS, published by Eidos Interactive. He left the project in the spring of 2006 to start a new game with Ubisoft Montpellier: Battle Tag, a laser tag shooter game, which was released in November 2010. In 2010, he was linked to Treasure Hunter Institute, a MMO adventure game developed by Ubisoft. This project was canceled in April 2011. In 2014, he founded a new studio, Gloomywood, and announced his new survival game 2Dark.  Games designed by Fr√©d√©rick Raynal  ;Independent: *Laser (1979, ZX81) *Robix 500 (1986, PC) (A.K.A.

Overview The National Assembly was originally established in 1918 and called the Armenian National Council, following Armenia's declaration of independence.https://iacis.ru/eng/parliaments/parlamenty_uchastniki/respublika_armeniya/ From 1938, the National Assembly of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was referred to as the Supreme Council of Armenia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the adoption of the new Constitution of Armenia in 1995, the formation of the current National Assembly was established. The National Assembly is a unicameral body. The National Assembly consists of at least 101 seats, but with additional seats allocated, it may grow to about 200 seats in extremely rare cases.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FkmCF27LeAFvbyrFAnHb7MiSQNcSxtoYabKu7G2fU5w/pubchart?oid=195701175&format;=interactive The President of the National Assembly is Ararat Mirzoyan.  Electoral system  According to a law adopted in 2016, parties need to pass a 5% threshold and coalitions 7% respectively to be included in the distribution of mandates. The election system reserves 50% of votes cast in favor of each party to be distributed via party lists. Out of these, four mandates will be assigned to national minorities first of all (provided they are included on party lists). A party list can not include over 70% of representatives of the same sex and its every four consecutive entries shall include members of both sexes. Another 50% of votes received by each party is distributed among their territorial lists submitted in 13 electoral districts. If neither party wins over 50% of mandates, a second round of elections is held. After the first round, the two best-placed parties participate in the second round. All mandates received during the first round are preserved. The party that wins the second round is given an additional number of mandates to reach 54% of all seats. If any party or coalition wins over two-thirds of the mandates in the first round of elections, sufficient additional mandates will be distributed among all other parties to ensure that at least one-third of all seats are given to parties other than the winning one, which would result in overhang seats.

The aim of these committees is to draw attention to exceptional cases that are not covered by the standing committees. According to the Constitution of Armenia, Article 73 \\"If appropriate, interim committees may be established as prescribed by the law on the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly for preliminary discussion of certain draft laws or for submitting to the National Assembly opinions, statements on certain issues, events and facts\\". Following the consideration and definition in the Constitution the Law on Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly clearly defines all the issues concerning the add hoc committees. More particularly, according to the article 22 of the mentioned law, add hoc committees are created by the decision of the National Assembly. The decision should contain information relating to the tasks, terms and procedures of an add hoc committee, meaning that the committee should operate only in very strict limitations set to the spheres of its investigation, the resources it may gain access to and also to the timeframes. The ultimate reason for existence of such committees is to deliver a report on its finding during a session of the National Assembly. Based on these reports, the Deputy may create a draft resolution in 2 days and if agreed by the Lead Committee, the resolution may be included in the draft agenda for upcoming four-day session.  Ad hoc committees: their goals, procedures, and results  = Committee on Ethics = One of the current add hoc committees of the National Assembly of Armenia is the Committee on Ethics. This is not a classical add hoc committee as it does exist during every session of the National Assembly but the committee functions till the beginning of the successive session when a new committee is formed. According to the Article 24.1 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly, each faction has the right to nominate at least 1 Deputy to the ethics committee. The chairperson of the committee and the vice- chairperson are appointed from the members of the committee by the nomination of faction, although the Chairperson of the National Assembly is the one to appoint the chairperson of the ethics committee, the vice chairperson, and to approve other members. If the chairperson of the ethics committee is from a non-opposition faction, the vice chairperson should be from the opposition faction and the vice versa. Factions have the right to change their representative in the ethics committee. According to the Article 24.2 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly the ethics committee provides conclusion to the National Assembly on violation by a Deputy of the requirements not to be engaged in entrepreneurial activities, not to hold offices in state or commercial organizations, and not to perform other paid work except for scientific, pedagogical or creative work (1st Paragraph of the Article 65 of the Constitution). The committee also decides if there was a violation of 2nd Paragraph of the Article 6.1 of the mentioned law i.e. the very basic requirements to abide the laws, to respect moral norms of the society, to be respectful to the colleagues, not to be guided by personal interests and so on, provides a Deputy with conclusion if his/her job is scientific, pedagogical or creative and more. The Committee on Ethics can require and obtain materials and documents relevant to the issues examined by the committee from any state agency; it can also demand to the state agencies with the exception of courts, judges and prosecutors to carry out checks, studies and expert examinations on the issues examined in the committee. The members of the ethics committee are free to enter any state institution or to examine any document relating to the case. Any individual can apply to the committee on ethics in cases prescribed by the law. The applicant should submit a written application with all the relevant documents. By proposal of the chairperson of the ethics committee but no later than ten days the committee starts the examination of the issue raised in the application or rejects its examination. The committee on ethics finishes its examination of the issue in 30 days after starting an examination; it may also extend the deadline by 20 days in case of necessity to implement a deeper research. The sittings of the committee are closed except of cases when the Deputy in the application suggests holding an open sitting. Sitting of the committee is valid if at least half of the members are present, and the sitting is held by the chairperson of the committee, the vice chairperson, or another member according to the prescriptions of the law. Member of the committee assigned for the examination of the issue is the main reporter and the Deputy indicated in the application is the supplementary reporter. The decisions and conclusions of the committee are adopted by the majority of votes if more than half of the members participated in the voting. The content of the application and name of the Deputy indicated in the application are not publicly available until the adoption of the final decision. The members of the ethics committee and other people participating in the activities of the committee cannot publicize details of the examination. One of the recent cases in this committee was an application indicating names of several Deputies and reporting that they voted instead for other Deputies during the voting. After examining the application, listening to the committee member appointed for the case and to the accused Deputies the committee on ethics found them guilty of violating the duty to abide the laws. Also, in order to eliminate this kind of issues in the future, the committee made a suggestion to make supplements and changes in the Law of the Republic of Armenia on the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly more specifically consider voting instead for other Deputies disturbance of the order and enforce the presiding officer to take immediate disciplinary measures against these Deputies that is depriving the Deputy from the right to be present during the session of the National Assembly. The National Assembly approved this suggestion.http://www.parliament.am/committee_docs_5/Etika/Voroshum_18.02.2016.pdf =Ad hoc Committee on Studying the Activity of the Gas Supply System in the Republic of Armenia= This committee was established in February 2014 to examine the protection level of natural gas consumers‚Äô interests (calories of supplied gas, testing gas usage counters, argumentations for the loss), examine the lawfulness of the accumulation of debt for natural gas during 2011-2013 and reasonableness of the amount of debt, to make predictions about the possibilities of alternative gas importers and other thoroughly listed issues relating to the gas supply system in Armenia as a whole including examination of prices for the gas and international practices. The committee hold closed sittings, the decisions and conclusions were adopted by the majority of votes, the committee had the right to require and obtain materials and documents relevant to the issues examined by the committee from any state agency; it can also demand to the state agencies with the exception of courts, judges and prosecutors to carry out checks, studies and expert examinations on the issues examined in the committee and so on.http://parliament.am/committee_docs_5/Gaz/260214_AJV109_220514_AJV116_210614_AJV121_N.pdf The committee presented its findings and conclusion during the session of the National Assembly of 7 April 2015. Changes according to the Constitutional Reform of 2015 According to the new constitution of the Republic of Armenia (Constitutional Reforms), the functions of committees previously defined as ad hoc committees are divided into temporary and inquiry committees. As stated in article 107 of the new Constitution, temporary committees may be developed only by the decision of the National Assembly to discuss certain draft laws and acts of the National Assembly and present views or statements connected to the National Assembly. Article 108 is about the inquiry committees of the National Assembly. 1\\\\. The inquiry committee should be formed if at least the twenty-five percent of the total number of parliamentarians present the demand, in order to acquaint facts of public interests to the National Assembly. 2\\\\. The National Assembly regulates the number of members of an inquiry committee. The places of the inquiry committees should be proportional to the number of faction's members. The chair of the committee should be the member of the parliament who presented a request. 3\\\\. If minimum one-quarter of an inquiry committee demands; state, local self-government bodies and officials are compelled to introduce to the committee required information regarding its remit, if the information is not classified as secrets protected by law. All the other regulations concerning temporary and inquiry committee should be established by the Law on Rules of Procedure of the National Assemblyhttp://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL- REF(2015)034-e Concerns relating to the ad hoc committees and the international experience According to the latest Constitutional Reforms the Republic of Armenia will have a parliamentary state governance system. This means that compared to the semi-presidential system the powers of the Parliament will be enhanced, an example of this is the right of oversight of the executive power of the republic which is and will be exercised by the Government (as of article 85 of the current and article 145 the new Constitutions). So, the Parliament will have more powers and functions; therefore, it needs more tools to exercise these powers and perform its functions. An inquiry committee is a great tool for the parliament to exercise oversight and that is why according to articles 107 and 108 of the new Constitution there is a differentiation between temporary and inquiry committees. However, in late 2015, there was a concern relating to the powers of these committees as prescribed by the article 108 of the new Constitution. Edmon Marukyan, the only non-party Deputy of the National Assembly of Armenia, suggested an addendum to the point 3 of article 108. According to him, the addendum should prescribe that the inquiry committees should be empowered to demand state and local self-government body officials to be present in the sittings of the committees and provide relevant explanations. The improvement was suggested for the first time on September 11, 2015, during the session of the Standing Committee on State and Legal Affairs of the National Assembly. By then, the suggestion received a positive feedback and the committee members stated that it could be approved on the constitutional level. However, the decision on the official proposal to the National Assembly was to include the addendum in the rules of procedure of the NA rather than in the Constitution. The international experience shows that giving such powers to inquiry committees is a common thing. Point 7 of rule 176 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament states that \\"A committee of inquiry may contact the institutions or persons referred to in Article 3 of the Decision referred to in paragraph 2 with a view to holding a hearing or obtaining documents.\\" Even though it was prescribed neither by the Constitution nor the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly that temporary committees have the power to hold a hearing with the presence of state and local self-government body officials, there was such a case when the committee held a closed-door hearing. On October 23 of 2008 with the order of the President of Armenia, a temporary committee of experts was formed on obtaining facts and evidence on the incidents of March 1, 2008. So as to gain the necessary information the committee was given the tools typical to a real parliamentarian inquiry committee.

After the Fall of France to Nazi Germany, the pro-Nazi Vichy France regime controlled the colonies. One by one they peeled off and switched their allegiance to the Free France movement led by Charles de Gaulle . In January 1944, Free French politicians and high-ranking colonial officials from the French African colonies met in Brazzaville in the modern- day Republic of the Congo. The conference recommended political, social, and economic reforms and led to the agreement on the Brazzaville Declaration. De Gaulle believed that the survival of France depended on support from these colonies, and he made numerous concessions. They included the end of forced labor, the end of special legal restrictions that applied to natives but not to whites, the establishment of elected territorial assemblies, representation in Paris in a new \\"French Federation\\", and the eventual entry of black Africans in the French Assembly. however, independence was explicitly rejected as a future possibility: :The ends of the civilizing work accomplished by France in the colonies excludes any idea of autonomy, all possibility of evolution outside the French bloc of the Empire; the eventual Constitution, even in the future of self-government in the colonies is denied.Tony Smith, \\"A Comparative Study of French and British Decolonization\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 20#1 (1978), pp. 70-102, quoting page 73  Context  During World War II, the French colonial empire played an essential role, through its gradual alignment with Free France. After the end of the Tunisia campaign, the entire colonial empire reunited in favor of the Allied forces; with the exception of French Indochina, which remained loyal to the Vichy government. Because of this role the French Committee of National Liberation began questioning the future of the colonies. The war created many difficulties for local people, and saw the growth of nationalist aspirations and tensions between communities in French North Africa; particularly in Algeria and Tunisia. In addition, the French were being aided by the US, which opposed colonialism. In Madagascar, the month of occupation by the United Kingdom after the invasion of the island had weakened French authority. Ren√© Pleven, Commissioner for the Colonies in the French Committee of National Liberation, wanted to avoid international arbitration of the future of the French Empire, and in that regard organized the Brazzaville conference, in French Equatorial Africa.  The Conference  Initially, the French Committee of National Liberation wanted to include all the governors from all free territories, but due to war difficulties, the Committee only included administrative repr√©sentants from French territories in Africa, which had already joined de Gaulle and Ren√© Pleven. Invitations were sent to 21 governors, nine members of the Consultative Assembly, and six observers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. De Gaulle opened the Conference by saying he wanted to build new foundations for France after years under the domination of Philippe P√©tain and his authoritarian regime. There was also a seemingly more open tone towards the French colonies. De Gaulle wanted to renew the relationship between France and \\"French Africa.\\" The Brazzaville Conference is still regarded as a turning point for France and its colonial empire. Many historians view it as the first step towards decolonization, albeit a precarious one. Conclusions The Brazzaville Declaration included the following points: # The French Empire would remain united. # Semi-autonomous assemblies would be established in each colony. # Citizens of France's colonies would share equal rights with French citizens. # Citizens of French colonies would have the right to vote for the French parliament. # The native population would be employed in public service positions within the colonies. # Economic reforms would be made to diminish the exploitative nature of the relationship between France and its colonies. However, the possibility of complete independence was soundly rejected.

It was a powerful kingdom that long resisted Portuguese colonisation attempts and was only integrated into Angola in the late nineteenth century. Origins and early history The first documentary mention of the Kingdom of Matamba is a reference to it giving tribute to the King of Kongo, then Afonso I of Kongo, in 1530. In 1535 Afonso subsequently mentioned Matamba as one of the regions over which he ruled as king in his titles. There is no further information on the kingdom's early history and modern oral traditions do not seem to illuminate this at the present state of research. However, it does not seem likely that Kongo had any more than a light and symbolic presence in Matamba, and its rulers were probably quite independent. Matamba undoubtedly had closer relations with its south southeastern neighbor Ndongo, then a powerful kingdom as well as with Kongo. During the mid-sixteenth century Matamba was ruled by an unknown queen, who received missionaries from Kongo, then a Christian kingdom, dispatched by King Diogo I (1545‚Äì1561). Though this queen received the missionaries and perhaps allowed them to preach, there is no indication that the kingdom converted to Christianity. The arrival of the Portuguese colonists under Paulo Dias de Novais in Luanda in 1575 altered the political situation as the Portuguese immediately became involved in Ndongo's affairs, and war broke out between Ndongo and Portugal in 1579. Although Matamba played a small role in the early wars, the threat of a Portuguese victory stirred the ruler of Matamaba (probably a king named Kambolo Matamba) to intervene. He sent an army to aid Ndongo against the Portuguese, and with these forces the combined armies were able to defeat and rout Portuguese forces at the Battle of the Lukala in 1590. Portuguese attacks and Ndongo's conquest In 1618 the Portuguese governor of Angola, Luis Mendes de Vasconcelos, launched a large scale attack on Ndongo, using newly acquired Imbangala allies. The allied Imbangala, mercenary soldiers from south of the Kwanza River, turned the day and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' forces to sack Ndongo's capital and pillage the country. During the following two years, Mendes de Vasconcelos' son Jo√£o led a detachment of Portuguese and Imbangala forces into Matamba where they did great damage. During this time the Imbangala band of Kasanje deserted the Portuguese and continued a campaign of destruction in Matamba. Thousands of Matamba subjects were killed and thousands more taken to America as slaves. It is during this period, for example that the ethnonym \\"Matamba\\" appears in slave inventories in Spanish America in considerable numbers. Ndongo continued to suffer attacks from Portuguese forces, and in 1624 Queen Njinga Mbandi (also known as Nzinga) took over as ruler of that country. She continued the war unsuccessfully against Portugal and was forced to flee the country in 1626 and then again in 1629. During her second flight Njinga entered Matamba and her forces routed the army of Matamba's ruler, Queen Mwongo Matamba, capturing her and taking her prisoner. From at least 1631 onward, Njinga made Matamba her capital, joining it to the Kingdom of Ndongo. The joint kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo: Njinga and her successors Queen Njinga ruled in Matamba from 1631 until her death in 1663. During this time she integrated the country into her domains and thousands of her former subjects who had fled Portuguese attacks with her settled there. She made several wars against Kasanje especially in 1634‚Äì5. In 1639 she received a Portuguese peace mission which did not achieve a treaty, but did reestablish relations between her and the Portuguese. When the Dutch took over Luanda in 1641, Njinga immediately sent ambassadors to make an alliance with them. During these years, she moved her capital from Matamba to Kavanga, where she conducted operations against the Portuguese. Though Ndongo forces won a significant victory over the Portuguese in at the Battle of Kombi in 1647, nearly forcing them to abandon the country and laying siege to their inland capital of Masangano, a Portuguese relief force led by Salvador de S√° in 1648 drove out the Dutch and forced Njinga to return to Matamba. Although she maintained a symbolic capital at Kindonga, an island in the Kwanza River where she and her predecessor had ruled, the real capital was at the town of Matamba (Santa Maria de Matamba). Njinga had been baptized as Ana de Sousa while in Luanda in 1622, and in 1654 she began peace overtures to Portugal. Njinga hoped that a peaceful relationship with Portugal would allow her to settle her kingdom and determine a successor, as she had no children. She formed a close alliance with a related family, whose leader Jo√£o Guterres Ngola Kanini, became one of her most important councillors. She was also anxious to remove Imbangala forces, led by Njinga Mona, from her army and place them under her direct control. For this reason she also sought to reconcile with the Catholic Church. This strategy was successful, she signed a peace treaty in 1657 and Italian Capuchin missionaries began working in her lands. They regarded Njinga in her later days as a model Christian and thousands of Matamba subjects were baptized. However, reintegration in the Christian community did not solve her problems, and there were still troubling issues of succession. The church refused to recognize a dynastic marriage between Jo√£o Guterres and her sister Barbara, because Guterres had a wife at the Portuguese fort of Mbaka where he had once been prisoner. Similarly, although the non and even anti-Christian Imbanagala allowed Njinga to alter some of their customs, Njinga Mona's power was unchecked in the army. =Civil war= After Njinga's death, a period of tension, punctuated by civil war, broke out. Barbara succeeded Njinga, but was killed by forces loyal to Njinga Mona in 1666. Jo√£o Guterres managed to temporarily oust Njinga Mona in 1669, but was defeated and killed in 1670. Njinga Mona would rule the kingdom until Jo√£o Guterres' son, Francisco, ousted and killed Njinga Mona becoming ruler in 1680. =Battle of Katole= In 1681 Francisco became involved in a war with neighboring Kasanje, in which he sought to promote the interests of one of the candidates to the throne. The Portuguese intervened in this war and invaded Matamba with a force of over 40,000 troops, the largest military force Portugal had even mobilized in Angola. The army penetrated to Katole, where Francisco launched a successful dawn attack on 4 September 1681, inflicting heavy casualties on the Portuguese army. However, Imbangala forces in the Portuguese army managed to stiffen resistance, and in the ensuing battle, Francisco and several of his relatives were killed. The Portuguese army, having suffered heavy losses withdrew to Ambaca and then to Masangano. Queen Ver√≥nica Francisco Guterres was succeeded by his sister Ver√≥nica I Guterres Kandala Kingwanga, whose long rule from 1681 to 1721 consolidated the control of the Guterres dynasty and created a lasting precedent for female rulers. Ver√≥nica was apparently a pious Christian, but also a fervent believer in Matamba's independence. In order to forestall another Portuguese invasion, Ver√≥nica sent an embassy to Luanda that negotiated a peace treaty, signed 7 September 1683. In it she accepted nominal vassalage, agreed to return Portuguese prisoners taken at the battle of Katole, allowed missionaries into the country and permitted agents of Portuguese free passage through her lands. She also agreed to acknowledge the independence of Kasanje and to renounce all claims on the country and to pay 200 slaves over 4 years as compensation. Ver√≥nica, however, was not really cowed, and within a few years was advancing claims as Queen of Ndongo and Matamba that rivaled those of her predecessor Njinga. In the process of asserting her claims she was drawn into wars with Portugal in 1689 and again in 1692‚Äì3. She also sought some sort of alliance with Kongo in 1706. These wars and the raiding in between major operations led to serious depopulation on the western edges of her domains. Ver√≥nica appears to have been anxious to reestablish a Christian mission in the country, abandoned following the death of Njinga and the civil war that followed. However, in spite of her various entreaties, the mission was not reestablished. The Portuguese invasion of 1744 When Ver√≥nica died in 1721 she was succeeded by her son Afonso I √Ålvares de Pontes. During his reign the northern district of Holo seceded from Matamba to form its own kingdom and entered into relations with Portugal. As a result of Matamba's attempts to prevent the secession and Portuguese trade with the rebel province, relations between Matamba and the Portuguese colony deteriorated. Ana II (Ana I was Queen Njinga as Matamba accepted the Christian names of former rulers and their dynasty), who came to power in 1741, faced a Portuguese invasion in 1744. The invasion of Matamba by Portuguese forces in 1744 was one of their largest military operations in the eighteenth century. In the course of their attack, Matamba's army inflicted a serious defeat on the Portuguese, but in spite of this, a remnant of the army managed to reach the capital of Matamba. In order to avoid a long war and to get them to withdraw, Ana II signed a treaty of vassalage with Portugal which renewed points conceded by Ver√≥nica in 1683. While the treaty allowed Portugal to claim Matamba as a vassal, and opened up Matamba to Portuguese trade, it had little effect on the real sovereignty of Matmaba, or indeed in the conduct of trade. Ana II, like Ver√≥nica before her, was interested in developing Matamba as a Christian country, routinely sending letters to the Capuchin prefect of Congo and Angola or the Portuguese authorities requesting missionaries come and establish permanent bases in her country. While the country was visited by missionaries from Cahenda and also from the Barefoot Carmelites, a permanent mission was not established. The divided kingdom Ana II died in 1756 and a civil war broke out at that time among rival contenders for the throne, during which Ver√≥nica II ruled briefly for a time but she was overthrown sometime after 1758, leaving Ana III on the throne. Ana III was in turn overthrown by Kalwete ka Mbandi, a military leader. Kalwete won the war, and was baptized as Francisco II upon taking the throne. However, two of Ana's daughters, Kamana and Murili escaped the civil war, took refuge in the ancient capital of Ndongo on the Kindonga islands and successfully resisted Francisco II's attempts to oust them. From this base Queen Kamana created a rival kingdom, and in 1767 tried unsuccessfully to obtain Portuguese help against her rival. While the Portuguese governor of the time, Francisco Innocencio de Sousa Coutinho granted her asylum and instructed his officials to respect her and her position, he did not favor direct intervention in affairs in the eastern part of the Portuguese zone. Kamana's son and successor did manage to end the division of the country by successfully recovering the capital and being crowned as king of Matamba in around 1810.

He was elected to parliament on the FORD ticket during the first multi-party election in 1992, serving as MP for parliament for South Imenti Constituency, Meru. Kiraitu decamped from FORD to Democratic Party (DP) when FORD splintered in the aftermath of the demise of its leader, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, retaining the South Imenti seat during the 1997 general elections. As an opposition member of parliament between 1991 and 2002, Kiraitu served as the shadow Attorney- General and member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Corruption. Murungi has been a member of parliament since 1992 and has formerly served as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and as the shadow Attorney General. In the 2002 Kenya General Elections he won the South Imenti Constituency MP seat for the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) party. After the Government's defeat in the 21 November 2005 constitutional referendum, he was appointed Minister of Energy. He was then reelected as a member of parliament under a Party of National Unity (PNU) ticket in the 2007 elections. On 8 August 2017, he was elected the governor of Meru County under a Jubilee ticket, defeating the Incumbent Peter Munya an effectively becoming the second governor of the county since its inception. Prior to being the Governor Kiraitu served as the Senator for Meru County after winning the seat under the Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) ticket in the 2013 elections. Scandals and Controversies In February 2005, Murungi apologised for making a remark which was criticised as trivialising both rape and corruption. He had said that criticism from aid donors of corruption in Kenya was \\"like raping a woman who is already willing\\". He is one of the closest allies of former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. He has been accused of attempting to cover-up in the Anglo Leasing Scandal, which he once claimed that it was a \\"scandal that never was\\". On 8 February 2006, the BBC World Service aired a conversation between Murungi and former Governance and Ethics Permanent Secretary John Githongo where he appears to be coercing Githongo to drop his investigations on the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He had promised that Anura Pereira would forgive a debt of KES 30 million owed by Githongo's father. Murungi initially maintained that he would not resign his cabinet post despite the allegations of corruption. He claimed that he was innocent and that Githongo's reports are mere propaganda. On the recording, he has commented: \\"I have listened to the alleged tape recorded evidence. It is truncated, inaudible, insufficient and inadmissible to form any credible proof of the allegations being orchestrated by Mr Githongo\\". On 13 February 2006, however, President Mwai Kibaki announced that Murungi had resigned to allow full investigation into the allegations. On 14 February 2006, a day after his resignation, Murungi has claimed that he played no role at all to cover-up the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He blamed his woes on the politics of National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) and the media. However, it later emerged that President Mwai Kibaki had asked him to resign from the government. On 10 February 2006, Murungi issued a statement that was faxed to all Kenyan media houses questioning the intentions and motives of John Githongo, in the form of 36 questions. Among the questions he asked is why John Githongo was recording his conversations with government officials and whether he was a spy for foreign nations.

Reptiles have on a number of occasions evolved into limbless forms ‚Äì snakes, amphisbaenia, and legless lizards (limb loss in lizards has evolved independently several times, examples include the families Pygopodidae and Dibamidae and species of Isopachys, Anguis, and Ophisaurus). The same is true of amphibians ‚Äì caecilians, Sirenidae (a clade of salamanders that are limbless except for atrophied front limbs), Amphiumidae (a clade of salamander with extremely atrophied limbs that appear non-functional) and at least three extinct groups (A√Østopoda, Lysorophia, and Adelospondyli). Larval amphibians, tadpoles, are also often limbless. Legless forms of reptiles and amphibians probably evolved so as to be able to move underground or in water more easily. Some analyses suggest that elongation and undulatory locomotion (slithering) evolved first, before limb loss. The debate about the origin of limblessness led to a temporary hypothesis about a marine origin for snakes, which is no longer favored since the discovery of snake fossils with hindlimbs. Phlegethontia longissima, fossil amphibians belonging to the limbless aistopods. In the case of limb loss during evolution, vestigial structures testify to this change (remains of the pelvis, rudimentary femur or spurs in boas, pythons and Typhlops). The evolutionary process of transforming quadrupedal lizards into legless forms results in three main characteristics: the regression of the limbs is carried out gradually, via the reduction in their size and the reduction in the number of phalanges or fingers; the multiplication of the vertebrae (up to 600 in some snakes) induces a lengthening and a gain in flexibility of the trunk; and the vertebral axis is homogenized from the neck to the cloaca, evoking an interminable ribcage. There are also a number of fish with elongated bodies that have no or reduced appendage-like fins, for example eels and swamp eels. While hagfish and lamprey also do not have appendage-like fins, they may not have lost them, but simply retained the form that vertebrates had before they evolved limbs. There are no known limbless species of mammal or bird, although partial limb-loss and reduction has occurred in several groups, including whales and dolphins, sirenians, kiwis, and the extinct moa and elephant birds. The moa in particular are notable for having completely lost their wings, without even vestigial wings remaining outside their bodies. Despite its name, the finless porpoise has two fins, and several species of legless lizards have tiny useless legs, such as pygopodids which retain rudimentary flaps. Contrarily, the worm lizard Bipes as its scientific name suggests has two stubby forelimbs which actually assist in digging similar to a mole. All other amphisbaenians have reduced or absent forelimb girdles.

History In 1922, the Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS) began to plan for the construction of a new high school that would serve the entire county, as the facilities of the now venerable 80 years old Barton Academy structure of Greek Revival architecture, in downtown, were becoming overcrowded and suffering from inadequate maintenance and difficult to maintain. In 1923 the Mobile County School Board acquired from the Carlen family for the site of their proposed high school complex. The cornerstone of the school was laid on 14 December 1925, and on 26 April 1926, Mobile High School opened. Construction costs totaled $850,000 for the first six buildings with an additional $200,000 spent on the gymnasium and the indoor pool installed in 1930. Two years after its opening the school's name was changed to Murphy High School in honor of Samuel Silenus Murphy, MCPSS superintendent from 1900 to 1926. While still called Mobile High School, the yearbook had been called the Mobile High Annual. At the change of the name to Murphy High School, the workers did not want to change the name of the yearbook. They agreed to shorten the name to Mohian, a shortened version of Mobile High Annual. The school was desegregated in 1963 when three African American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to the then all-white school.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 260-261. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. The court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year. By the fall of 1970, following stringent desegregation efforts in Alabama, 1,500 of the school's 2,140 students were African American. At the same time, the school had 34 African American teachers on its 87-member faculty.United States Department of Health Education and Welfare (DHEW) Office for Civil Rights, Directory of Public Secondary and Elementary Schools in Selected Districts: Fall 1970, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1972, p. 16. In 1982 Murphy High School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1987 it was selected as a Presidential Model School by the U.S. Department of Education. Redbook magazine named Murphy as one of the top high schools in the United States and one of the largest high schools in Alabama in 1994. Murphy students were featured in the Seventeen magazine issue for November 1996 fashion trends in high school. Several students from the classes of 1997 and 1998 were included in the magazine. On December 25, 2012, Murphy High School was hit directly by an EF2 wedge tornado, which caused significant damage to the campus. Students and faculty were relocated. They finished the remainder of the 2012 school year at the former Shaw High School in west Mobile while the Murphy campus was rebuilt.

The ruins of the site and an archaeological museum are located south of the modern town Scoglitti, a frazione of the comune Vittoria in the province of Ragusa. History It was founded by Syracuse in 599 BC, but destroyed by the mother city in 552 BC. Its remains are today in the municipality of Ragusa. The Geloans, however, founded it anew in 461 BC, under the Olympic charioteer Psaumis of Camarina. It seems to have been in general hostile to Syracuse, but, though an ally of Athens in 427 BC, it gave some slight help to Syracuse in 415‚Äì413 BC. It was destroyed by the Carthaginians in 405 BC, restored by Timoleon in 339 BC after its abandonment by Dionysius' order, but in 258 BC fell into the hands of the Romans. Its complete destruction dates from AD 853. The site of the ancient city is among rapidly shifting sandhills, and the lack of stone in the neighborhood has led to its buildings being used as a quarry even by the inhabitants of Gela, so that nothing is now visible above ground but a small part of the wall of the temple of Athena and a few foundations of houses; portions of the city wall have been traced by excavation, and the necropolis has been carefully explored. Democracy in Kamarina When the Geloans re-founded the city in 461, they appear to have done so with a democratic constitution (alongside a more general institution of democracies in the wake of the Common Resolution: Diod. 11.68.5). In 415 Thucydides describes a public meeting (syllogos: 6.75-88) at which the city decided for neutrality (though it later voted to reverse this decision: 7.33.1, 7.58.1). A series of more than 140 lead plates, discovered around the Temple of Athena, and with information about citizens written on them, has suggested to some that Kamarina used allotment to select jurors and city officials (as Athens and other democratic city-states did). These may, however, have had some other use, for example, as a register of citizens for military purposes.See E. Robinson, Democracy Beyond Athens (Cambridge, 2011) 97-100. The marsh Just before the Carthaginians razed Kamarina in the 5th century BC, the Kamarinians were plagued with a mysterious disease. The marsh of Kamarina had protected the city from its hostile neighbors to the north. It was suspected that the marsh was the source of the strange illness and the idea of draining the marsh to end the epidemic became popular (the germ theory of disease was millennia in the future, but some people associated swamps with disease). The town oracle was consulted. The oracle advised the leaders not to drain the marsh, suggesting the plague would pass with time. But the discontent was widespread and the leaders opted to drain the marsh against the oracle's advice. Once it was dry, there was nothing stopping the Carthaginian army from advancing. They marched across the newly drained marsh and razed the city, killing every last inhabitant. The story of the marsh is told by the Roman geographer Strabo and repeated by Carl Sagan in Pale Blue Dot. The story of the city is recounted by the latter author as a lesson: that action guided by fear and ignorance often intensifies the problems it seeks to ameliorate. Remains Modern remains are scanty. They include archaic tombs (seventh century BC) and ruins of a temple of Athena. Nearby are tombs of a necropolis from the fifth-fourth century BC. Part of the remains are now in the archaeological museum of Syracuse. The archaeological park includes the remains of a \\"Hamman qbel Jamaa\\" - public baths used before entering the mosque, one of only two known on the island.

In popular culture, the practice is most typical of foreigners' stereotypical image of Greece, and while it occurs more rarely today, it continues to be seen on certain occasions, such as weddings, although plaster plates are more likely to be used. History in Greece =Ancient and medieval= The custom probably derives from an ancient practice of ritually \\"killing\\" plates on mourning occasions, as a means of dealing with loss. Breaking plates may also be related to the ancient practice of conspicuous consumption, a display of one's wealth, as plates or glasses are thrown into a fireplace following a banquet instead of being washed and reused. =Modern times= In 1969, the military dictatorship of Georgios Papadopoulos, that had suspended democracy and ruled Greece autocratically from 1967 to 1974, banned plate smashing. Nowadays specially-produced plaster plates are used. Another modern variation on the custom is for diners at small Greek restaurants or tavernas to buy trays of flowers that they can throw at singers and each other. In popular culture * In the Three's Company episode \\"Opening Night,\\" (November 16, 1982) Larry Dallas invites his family, visiting from Greece, to Jacks Bistro. The large family gathering ends with the Greek celebratory custom of the breaking of plates. Reluctant at first because of all the money it will cost to replace the plates, Jack joins in the celebration when Larry says they will cover the bill for each plate. Jack then looks at Janet who shows him the final cost of all the plates that were broken. Jack, while clenching the remaining two plates he owns, throws them up in the air and says \\"Opa!\\" and lets them break as well. * In Part I of The Love Boat S6 E18 episode (February 5, 1983) titled: \\"Isaac's Aegean Affair/The Captain and the Kid/Poor Rich Man/The Dean and the Flunkee,\\" Gopher initiates plate smashing in a Greek restaurant. * In the Full House episode, \\"Greek Week\\", there is a scene at a Greek family party where Rebecca Donaldson smashes one plate.

His wife, Heva, corresponds to Eve. Har appears in Tiriel (1789) and The Song of Los (1795) and is briefly mentioned in The Book of Thel (1790) and Vala, or The Four Zoas (1796-1803). Synopsis \\"Har and Heva bathing\\"; Har and Heva are shown naked in a shallow stream whilst Mnetha lies behind looking on. Many years before Tiriel begins, Har was overthrown by his children, Tiriel, Ijim and Zazel. As time went by, he and his wife, Heva, came to reside in the Vales of Har, where they gradually succumbed to dementia, regressing to a childlike state to such an extent that they came to think their guardian, Mnetha, is their mother, spending their days chasing birds and singing in a \\"great cage\\" (Tiriel; 3:21). After Tiriel loses his throne to his own children, he visits Har and Heva. Excited by the visit, although unaware that Tiriel is their son, they ask him to stay with them, but he refuses and resumes his wanderings. Later, after Tiriel has had most of his own children killed, he returns to the Vales with the express purpose of condemning his parents, and the way they brought him up, declaring that Har's laws and his own wisdom now \\"end together in a curse\\" (8:8); Upon this declamation, Tiriel then dies at their feet. In the Africa section of the later poem The Song of Los (1795), which is set chronologically before Tiriel, Har and Heva are forced to flee into the wilderness, after their family rebel against them. In their exile in the desert, they then turn into reptiles. Background Mary S. Hall believes that Har's name is derived from Jacob Bryant's A New System or Analysis of Antient Mythology (1776), where Bryant conflates the Amazonian deities Harmon and Ares with the Egyptian deity Harmonia, wife of Cadmus. Blake had engraved plates for the book in the early 1780s, so he would have certainly have been familiar with its content.David V. Erdman, Blake: Prophet Against Empire (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1954; 2nd ed. 1969; 3rd ed. 1977) 133n41 As a character, S. Foster Damon believes that Har represents both the \\"decadent poetry of Blake's day\\"S. Foster Damon, A Blake Dictionary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake (Hanover: University Press of New England 1965; revised ed. 1988), 174 and the traditional spirit of Christianity.Damon, A Blake Dictionary, 405 Northrop Frye reaches a similar conclusion, but also sees divergence in the character, arguing that although Har and Heva are based on Adam and Eve, \\"Har is distinguished from Adam. Adam is ordinary man in his mixed twofold nature of imagination and Selfhood. Har is the human Selfhood which, though men spend most of their time trying to express it, never achieves reality and is identified only as death. Har, unlike Adam, never outgrows his garden but remains there shut up from the world in a permanent state of near- existence.\\"Northrop Frye, Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), 242 Harold Bloom agrees with this interpretation, arguing that \\"Har is natural man, the isolated selfhood.\\" Bloom also believes that Har is comparable to Struldbruggs from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) and Tithonus from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem of the same name (1859).Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in David V. Erdman (ed.), The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake (New York: Anchor Press, 1965; 2nd ed. 1982), 946 'Har' is the Hebrew word for 'mountain', thus giving an inherent irony to the phrase \\"Vales of Har\\". Damon believes this conveys the ironic sense that \\"he who was a mountain now lives in a vale, cut off from mankind. Blake's mythology The Song of Los, Plate 4, showing Har and Heva fleeing from the \\"War & Lust\\" of their brethren. Both Har and the Vales of Har feature in Blake's subsequent prophetic work. The Vales of Har are mentioned in The Book of Thel (1790), and it is in the Vales where lives Thel herself. Throughout the poem they are represented as a place of purity and innocence; \\"I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers\\" (3:18). At the end of the poem, when Thel is shown the world of experience outside the Vales, she panics and flees back to the safety of her home; \\"The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek./Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har\\" (6:21-22). In the Africa section The Song of Los (1795), which is set chronologically before Tiriel, Har and Heva flee into the wilderness, after their family rebel against them: Damon refers to this transformation as turning them into \\"serpents of materialism,\\" which he relates back to their role in Tiriel. Har and Ijim are also briefly mentioned in Vala, or The Four Zoas (1796-1803), where Har is the sixteenth son of Los and Enitharmon, and Ijim the eighteenth. Har's immediate father is Satan, representative of self-love in Blake, and his children are Ijim and Ochim (The Four Zoas, VIII:360).

It is part of a group of publicly funded institutions in India known as National Institutes of Technology. It is named after the Independent India's first Minister of Education, scholar and independence activist Abul Kalam Azad who is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad. Established in the year 1960 as Maulana Azad College of Technology (MACT) or Regional Engineering College (REC), Bhopal, it became a National Institute of Technology in 2002 and was recognized as an Institute of National Importance under the NIT Act in 2007. The Institute is fully funded by Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Government of India is governed by the NIT Council. It offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, architecture and management. History MANIT was started in 1960 as Maulana Azad College of Technology (MACT), named after the first Minister of Education of India, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. MACT started functioning in 1960 at Govt S.V. Polytechnic with an intake of 120 students and seven faculty members. It was one of the first eight Regional Engineering Colleges started during the second five-year plan (1956-1960) in India, where the main focus was development of the public sector and rapid industrialization. The institute was named after Maulana Abul Kalam Azad To ensure enough supply of trained personnel to meet the demand for these projects, a decision was taken to start the Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), at the rate of one per each major state, which can churn out graduates with good engineering merit. Thus, seventeen RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. MACT was one of the first 8 REC's to be established in each region in India. It was established in the Western Region along with Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat. It first operated from the Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic with Mr.S.R. Beedkar, Principal of Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic as the planning officer of the institute. The foundation stone of the Institute building was laid by the then Prime Minister late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 23 April 1961. The Institute Progressed into the higher level of an education center in the steady development of infrastructure as well as academics. Shri J.N.Moudgill became the first principal of MACT in 1962. 5-years degree program in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering was started. In 1963, the five-year Bachelor of Architecture was started as well. In 1964, Institute is shifted to its own building which is its present campus. As the necessity of science and technology kept on growing, more undergraduate program kept on getting added which were- Electronics and Communications Engineering in 1972, Computer Science and Engineering in 1986, Information Technology in 2001 (later merged with Computer Science and Engineering in 2013 and 3-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in 1988. The success of technology-based industry led to high demand for technical and scientific education. During the Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Minister of Human Resource Development, Murli Manohar Joshi decided to upgrade all \\"Regional Engineering Colleges\\" to \\"National Institutes of Technology\\" that shall be funded by the Central Government itself. Hence, in 2002, all REC's became NIT's and MACT became Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT). In the same year, MANIT was granted deemed university status. With this advancement, the World Bank assisted \\"Technical Education Quality Improvement Program\\" started in 2003, for the rapid academic and infrastructural growth of the college. In addition to engineering programs, an MBA program as well commenced from 2006. The Government of India in 2007 passed the NIT Act as per which MANIT was declared an Institute of National Importance.  Administration  The NIT Council is the governing body of India's National Institutes of Technology (NIT) system. The NIT Council is each NIT's Board of Governors.  Campus and Infrastructure  MANIT is spread over 650 acres which makes it one of the largest NITs in India in terms of total campus area. The entire campus consists of administrative and academic buildings, workshops, library and community centers, residential accommodations for students and staff and other general amenities such as Post Office, a Bank with ATM, Shopping complex, a School for children, medical care unit, an auditorium with the capacity of 1000 persons and sports complex with vast expand of open area.

It tells a version of the life of Barabbas, the man whom the Bible relates was released instead of Jesus. The novel is built on antithesis: Jesus dies first among the three crucified ‚Äì Barabbas dies last. Jesus dies among several of his friends ‚Äì Barabbas dies alone. Jesus talks to God ‚Äì Barabbas talks to the darkness. The novel starts with Jesus' crucifixion and ends with Barabbas' crucifixion in Rome. Plot Jesus is crucified on Mount Golgotha. To the side of the crowd stands Barabbas. A violent man, a brigand, and a rebel, he cannot muster much respect for the resignation of the Man who died in his place. He is skeptical about the Holiness of Jesus, but he is also fascinated by His sacrifice. He seeks out different followers of Jesus in trying to understand Him, but finds that their exalted views of Jesus do not match his down-to-earth observation of Him. More important, since Barabbas has never been the recipient of love (the cornerstone of the Christian faith), he finds that he is unable to understand love and, hence, unable to understand the Christian faith. He says that he \\"wants to believe,\\" but for Barabbas, understanding is a prerequisite for belief, so he is unable to. Enslaved, shackled to another man named Sahak, and condemned to work in the notoriously life-shortening and infernal copper mines of Ancient Rome, Barabbas has an extraordinary crisis of faith, the exact nature of which is elucidated in the final portion of the novel. Barabbas's ultimate loyalties lie with the opaque, remorseless void that fed and surrounded his former life, manifested in the darkness of the night of his execution, which he surrenders himself to with his final breath.

It is a comprehensive data and information system designed to perform a wide variety of functions in support of a heterogeneous national and international user community. EOSDIS provides a spectrum of services; some services are intended for a diverse group of casual users while others are intended only for a select cadre of research scientists chosen by NASA's peer-reviewed competitions, and then many fall somewhere in between. The primary services provided by EOSDIS are User Support, Data Archive, Management and Distribution, Information Management, and Product Generation, all of which are managed by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project. EOSDIS ingests, processes, archives, and distributes data from a large number of Earth-observing satellite,Earth observing satellites and provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA's Earth science data from various sources ‚Äì satellites, aircraft, field measurements, and various other programs. For the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite missions, EOSDIS provides capabilities for command and control, scheduling, data capture and initial (Level 0) processing. These capabilities, constituting the EOSDIS Mission Operations, are managed by the Earth Science Mission Operations (ESMO) Project. NASA network capabilities transport the data to the science operations facilities. EOSDIS consists of a set of processing facilities and Distributed Active Archive Centers distributed across the United States. These processing facilities and DAACs serve hundreds of thousands of users around the world, providing hundreds of millions of data files each year covering many Earth science disciplines. The EOSDIS project as of September 2012 reported it contained approximately 10 PB of data in its database with ingestion of approximately 8.5 TB daily. The remaining capabilities of EOSDIS constitute the EOSDIS Science Operations, which are managed by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project. These capabilities include: generation of higher level (Level 1-4) science data products for EOS missions; archiving and distribution of data products from EOS and other satellite missions, as well as aircraft and field measurement campaigns. The EOSDIS science operations are performed within a distributed system of many interconnected nodes (Science Investigator-led Processing Systems and distributed, discipline-specific, Earth science Distributed Active Archive Centers) with specific responsibilities for production, archiving, and distribution of Earth science data products. The Distributed Active Archive Centers serve a large and diverse user community (as indicated by EOSDIS performance metrics) by providing capabilities to search and access science data products and specialized services.  History  From early 1980 through 1986, NASA supported pilot data system studies to assess the feasibility and development of publicly accessible electronic data systems. Part of the congressional approval of the EOS mission in 1990 included the NASA Earth Science Enterprise, which supported the development of a long-term data and information system (EOSDIS). This system would be accessible to both the science research community and the broader public, built on a distributed open architecture. With these functional requirements for space operations control and product generation for EOS, the EOSDIS would also be responsible for the data archival, management, and distribution of all NASA Earth science mission instrument data during the mission life.

Birds are one of only four taxonomic groups to have evolved powered flight. A number of animals have evolved aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. Flight has evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid canopy animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among rainforest animals, especially in the rainforests in Asia (most especially Borneo) where the trees are tall and widely spaced. Several species of aquatic animals, and a few amphibians and reptiles have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically as a means of evading predators. Types Animal aerial locomotion can be divided into two categories‚Äîpowered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces to climb or to maintain steady, level flight. Those who can find air that is rising faster than they are falling can gain altitude by soaring. =Unpowered= These modes of locomotion typically require an animal start from a raised location, converting that potential energy into kinetic energy and using aerodynamic forces to control trajectory and angle of descent. Energy is continually lost to drag without being replaced, thus these methods of locomotion have limited range and duration. * Falling: decreasing altitude under the force of gravity, using no adaptations to increase drag or provide lift. * Parachuting: falling at an angle greater than 45¬∞ from the horizontal with adaptations to increase drag forces. Very small animals may be carried up by the wind. Some gliding animals may use their gliding membranes for drag rather than lift, to safely descend. * Gliding flight: falling at an angle less than 45¬∞ from the horizontal with lift from adapted aerofoil membranes. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower aspect ratio (wing length/breadth) than true flyers. =Powered flight= Powered flight has evolved at least four times: first in the insects, then in pterosaurs, next in birds, and last in bats. Studies on theropod dinosaurs do suggest multiple (>3) independent acquisitions of powered flight however, and a recent study proposes independent acquisitions amidst the different bat clades as well.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mam.12211 Powered flight uses muscles to generate aerodynamic force, which allows the animal to produce lift and thrust. The animal may ascend without the aid of rising air. =Externally powered= Ballooning and soaring are not powered by muscle, but rather by external aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively. Both can continue as long as the source of external power is present. Soaring is typically only seen in species capable of powered flight, as it requires extremely large wings. * Ballooning: being carried up into the air from the aerodynamic effect on long strands of silk in the wind. Certain silk-producing arthropods, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight gossamer silk for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude. * Soaring: gliding in rising or otherwise moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air is due to thermals, ridge lift or other meteorological features. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring. Many species will use multiple of these modes at various times; a hawk will use powered flight to rise, then soar on thermals, then descend via free-fall to catch its prey. Evolution and ecology =Gliding and parachuting= While gliding occurs independently from powered flight, it has some ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very energy-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as fruits, nectar, and insects. In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates); however these groups have not radiated nearly as much as have groups of flying animals. Worldwide, the distribution of gliding animals is uneven as most inhabit rain forests in Southeast Asia. (Despite seemingly suitable rain forest habitats, few gliders are found in India or New Guinea and none in Madagascar.) Additionally, a variety of gliding vertebrates are found in Africa, a family of hylids (flying frogs) lives in South America and several species of gliding squirrels are found in the forests of northern Asia and North America. Various factors produce these disparities. In the forests of Southeast Asia, the dominant canopy trees (usually dipterocarps) are taller than the canopy trees of the other forests. A higher start provides a competitive advantage of further glides and farther travel. Gliding predators may more efficiently search for prey. The lower abundance of insect and small vertebrate prey for carnivorous animals (such as lizards) in Asian forests may be a factor. In Australia, many mammals (and all mammalian gliders) possess, to some extent, prehensile tails. =Powered flight evolution= Analogous flying adaptions in vertebrates: Powered flight has evolved unambiguously only four times‚Äîbirds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects (though see above for possible independent acquisitions within bird and bat groups). In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically gives rise to only a handful of species, all three extant groups of powered flyers have a huge number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. Bats, after rodents, have the most species of any mammalian order, about 20% of all mammalian species. Birds have the most species of any class of terrestrial vertebrates. Finally, insects (most of which fly at some point in their life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined. The evolution of flight is one of the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider. Insects were the first to evolve flight, approximately 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live on the surface of the water, while another is that they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects. Pterosaurs were the next to evolve flight, approximately 228 million years ago. These reptiles were close relatives of the dinosaurs (and sometimes mistakenly considered dinosaurs by laymen), and reached enormous sizes, with some of the last forms being the largest flying animals ever to inhabit the Earth, having wingspans of over 9.1 m (30 ft). However, they spanned a large range of sizes, down to a 250 mm (10 in) wingspan in Nemicolopterus. Birds have an extensive fossil record, along with many forms documenting both their evolution from small theropod dinosaurs and the numerous bird-like forms of theropod which did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Indeed, Archaeopteryx is arguably the most famous transitional fossil in the world, both due to its mix of reptilian and avian anatomy and the luck of being discovered only two years after Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species. However, the ecology of this transition is considerably more contentious, with various scientists supporting either a \\"trees down\\" origin (in which an arboreal ancestor evolved gliding, then flight) or a \\"ground up\\" origin (in which a fast-running terrestrial ancestor used wings for a speed boost and to help catch prey). Bats are the most recent to evolve (about 60 million years ago), most likely from a fluttering ancestor, though their poor fossil record has hindered more detailed study. Only a few animals are known to have specialised in soaring: the larger of the extinct pterosaurs, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing area relative to their weight, which maximizes lift. Soaring is very energetically efficient. Biomechanics =Gliding and parachuting= During a free-fall with no aerodynamic forces, the object accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity as the object descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented at an angle to the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby. During gliding, lift plays an increased role. Like drag, lift is proportional to velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away. =Powered flight= Unlike most air vehicles, in which the objects that generate lift (wings) and thrust (engine/propeller) are separate and the wings remain fixed, flying animals use their wings to generate both lift and thrust by moving them relative to the body. This has made the flight of organisms considerably harder to understand than that of vehicles, as it involves varying speeds, angles, orientations, areas, and flow patterns over the wings. A bird or bat flying through the air at a constant speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. Pterosaur flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study. Insect flight is considerably different, due to their small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates. There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling-and-clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, at the price of wear and tear on the wings. Limits and extremes =Flying/soaring= * Largest. The largest known flying animal was formerly thought to be Pteranodon, a pterosaur with a wingspan of up to . However, the more recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus is much larger, with estimates of the wingspan ranging from . Some other recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur species, such as Hatzegopteryx, may have also wingspans of a similar size or even slightly larger. Although it is widely thought that Quetzalcoatlus reached the size limit of a flying animal, the same was once said of Pteranodon. The heaviest living flying animals are the kori bustard and the great bustard with males reaching . The wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan of any living flying animal at . Among living animals which fly over land, the Andean condor and the marabou stork have the largest wingspan at . Studies have shown that it is physically possible for flying animals to reach wingspans, but there is no firm evidence that any flying animal, not even the azhdarchid pterosaurs, got that large. Comparison of Quetzalcoatlus northropi with a Cessna 172 light aircraft * Smallest. There is no minimum size for getting airborne. Indeed, there are many bacteria floating in the atmosphere that constitute part of the aeroplankton. However, to move about under one's own power and not be overly affected by the wind requires a certain amount of size. The smallest flying vertebrates are the bee hummingbird and the bumblebee bat, both of which may weigh less than . They are thought to represent the lower size limit for endotherm flight. * Fastest. The fastest of all known flying animals is the peregrine falcon, which when diving travels at or faster. The fastest animal in flapping horizontal flight may be the Mexican free-tailed bat, said to attain about based on ground speed by an aircraft tracking device; that measurement does not separate any contribution from wind speed, so the observations could be caused by strong tailwinds. * Slowest. Most flying animals need to travel forward to stay aloft. However, some creatures can stay in the same spot, known as hovering, either by rapidly flapping the wings, as do hummingbirds, hoverflies, dragonflies, and some others, or carefully using thermals, as do some birds of prey. The slowest flying non-hovering bird recorded is the American woodcock, at . * Highest flying. There are records of a R√ºppell's vulture Gyps rueppelli, a large vulture, being sucked into a jet engine above C√¥te d'Ivoire in West Africa. The animal that flies highest most regularly is the bar-headed goose Anser indicus, which migrates directly over the Himalayas between its nesting grounds in Tibet and its winter quarters in India. They are sometimes seen flying well above the peak of Mount Everest at . Airborne flying squirrel. =Gliding/parachuting= * Most efficient glider. This can be taken as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. Flying squirrels are known to glide up to , but have measured glide ratio of about 2. Flying fish have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts on the edge of waves with only their initial leap from the water to provide height, but may be obtaining additional lift from wave motion. On the other hand, albatrosses have measured lift/drag ratios of 20, and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air. * Most maneuverable glider. Many gliding animals have some ability to turn, but which is the most maneuverable is difficult to assess. Even paradise tree snakes, Chinese gliding frogs, and gliding ants have been observed as having considerable capacity to turn in the air. Flying animals =Extant= A bee in flight. Insects * Insects. The first of all animals to evolve flight, insects are also the only invertebrates that have evolved flight. The species are too numerous to list here. Insect flight is an active research field. Fish * Freshwater hatchetfish (possibly flying). There are 9 species of freshwater hatchetfish split among 3 genera. Freshwater hatchetfish have an extremely large sternal region that is fitted with a large amount of muscle that allows it to flap its pectoral fins. They can move in a straight line over a few metres to escape predators . Birds are a successful group of flying vertebrate. Birds * Birds (flying, soaring) ‚Äî Most of the approximately 10,000 living species can fly (flightless birds are the exception). Bird flight is one of the most studied forms of aerial locomotion in animals. See List of soaring birds for birds that can soar as well as fly. Townsends's big-eared bat, (Corynorhinus townsendii) displaying the \\"hand wing\\" Mammals * Bats. There are approximately 1,240 bat species, representing about 20% of all classified mammal species. Most bats are nocturnal and many feed on insects while flying at night, using echolocation to home in on their prey. =Extinct= Pterosaurs included the largest known flying animals Reptiles * Pterosaurs. Pterosaurs were the first flying vertebrates, and are generally agreed to have been sophisticated flyers. They had large wings formed by a patagium stretching from the torso to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. There were hundreds of species, most of which are thought to have been intermittent flappers, and many soarers. The largest known flying animals are pterosaurs. Non-avian dinosaurs * Theropods (gliding/flying). There were several species of theropod dinosaur thought to be capable of gliding or flying, that are not classified as birds (though they are closely related). Some species (Microraptor gui, Microraptor zhaoianus, Cryptovolans pauli, and Changyuraptor) have been found that were fully feathered on all four limbs, giving them four 'wings' that they are believed to have used for gliding or flying. One species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight while the adults are flightless, a characteristic also seen in some modern birds like the horned coot and the flying steamer duck. A recent study indicates that flight may have been acquired independently in various different lineages. Mammals * Several species of extinct bat have been found, like Icaronycteris, Palaeochiropteryx, and Onychonycteris. Gliding animals =Extant= Insects * Gliding bristletails. Directed aerial gliding descent is found in some tropical arboreal bristletails, an ancestrally wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The bristletails median caudal filament is important for the glide ratio and gliding control * Gliding ants. The flightless workers of these insects have secondarily gained some capacity to move through the air. Gliding has evolved independently in a number of arboreal ant species from the groups Cephalotini, Pseudomyrmecinae, and Formicinae (mostly Camponotus). All arboreal dolichoderines and non- cephalotine myrmicines except Daceton armigerum do not glide. Living in the rainforest canopy like many other gliders, gliding ants use their gliding to return to the trunk of the tree they live on should they fall or be knocked off a branch. Gliding was first discovered for Cephalotes atreus in the Peruvian rainforest. Cephalotes atreus can make 180 degree turns, and locate the trunk using visual cues, succeeding in landing 80% of the time. Unique among gliding animals, Cephalotini and Pseudomyrmecinae ants glide abdomen first, the Forminicae however glide in the more conventional head first manner. * Gliding immature insects. The wingless immature stages of some insect species that have wings as adults may also show a capacity to glide. These include some species of cockroach, mantid, katydid, stick insect and true bug. Spiders * Ballooning spiders (parachuting). The young of some species of spiders travel through the air by using silk draglines to catch the wind, as may some smaller species of adult spider, such as the money spider family. This behavior is commonly known as \\"ballooning\\". Ballooning spiders make up part of the aeroplankton. * Gliding spiders. Some species of arboreal spider of the genus Selenops can glide back to the trunk of a tree should they fall. Neon flying squid Molluscs * Flying squid. Several oceanic squids of the family Ommastrephidae, such as the Pacific flying squid, will leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of flying fish. Smaller squids will fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as . Small fins towards the back of the mantle do not produce much lift, but do help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet- propelled aerial locomotion. The neon flying squid has been observed to glide for distances over , at speeds of up to .http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/it-bird-it-plane-no-its-squid Band- winged flying fish, with enlarged pectoral fins Fish * Flying fish. There are over 50 species of flying fish belonging to the family Exocoetidae. They are mostly marine fishes of small to medium size. The largest flying fish can reach lengths of but most species measure less than in length. They can be divided into two-winged varieties and four-winged varieties. Before the fish leaves the water it increases its speed to around 30 body lengths per second and as it breaks the surface and is freed from the drag of the water it can be traveling at around .Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. The glides are usually up to in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds (Video here BBC NEWS Science/Nature Fast flying fish glides by ferry). It has been suggested that the genus Exocoetus is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged pectoral fins when airborne, but still seems only to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke. It has been found that some flying fish can glide as effectively as some flying birds.Flying fish perform as well as some birds - Los Angeles Times * Halfbeaks. A group related to the Exocoetidae, one or two hemirhamphid species possess enlarged pectoral fins and show true gliding flight rather than simple leaps. Marshall (1965) reports that Euleptorhamphus viridis can cover in two separate hops.Marshall, N.B. (1965) The Life of Fishes. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. 402 pp. * Freshwater butterflyfish (possibly gliding). Pantodon buchholzi has the ability to jump and possibly glide a short distance. It can move through the air several times the length of its body. While it does this, the fish flaps its large pectoral fins, giving it its common name.Berra, Tim M. (2001). Freshwater Fish Distribution. San Diego: Academic Press. However, it is debated whether the freshwater butterfly fish can truly glide, Saidel et al. (2004) argue that it cannot. Illustration of Wallace's flying frog in Alfred Russel Wallace's 1869 book The Malay Archipelago Amphibians Gliding has evolved independently in two families of tree frogs, the Old World Rhacophoridae and the New World Hylidae. Within each lineage there are a range of gliding abilities from non-gliding, to parachuting, to full gliding. * Rhacophoridae flying frogs. A number of the Rhacophoridae, such as Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being enlarged toe membranes. For example, the Malayan flying frog Rhacophorus prominanus glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, the base of the leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the Chinese flying frog Rhacophorus dennysi can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either rolling into the turn (a banked turn) or yawing into the turn (a crabbed turn). * Hylidae flying frogs. The other frog family that contains gliders. Kuhl's flying gecko Ptychozoon kuhli. Note the gliding adaptations: flaps of skin on the legs, feet, sides of the body, and on the sides of the head. Reptiles Several lizards and snakes are capable of gliding: * Draco lizards. There are 28 species of lizard of the genus Draco, found in Sri Lanka, India, and Southeast Asia. They live in trees, feeding on tree ants, but nest on the forest floor. They can glide for up to and over this distance they lose only in height. Unusually, their patagium (gliding membrane) is supported on elongated ribs rather than the more common situation among gliding vertebrates of having the patagium attached to the limbs. When extended, the ribs form a semicircle on either side the lizard's body and can be folded to the body like a folding fan. * Gliding lacertids. There are two species of gliding lacertid, of the genus Holaspis, found in Africa. They have fringed toes and tail sides and can flatten their bodies for gliding/parachuting. * Ptychozoon flying geckos. There are six species of gliding gecko, of the genus Ptychozoon, from Southeast Asia. These lizards have small flaps of skin along their limbs, torso, tail, and head that catch the air and enable them to glide. * Lupersaurus flying geckos. A possible sister-taxon to Ptychozoon which has similar flaps and folds and also glides. * Thecadactylus flying geckos. At least some species of Thecadactylus, such as T. rapicauda, are known to glide. * Cosymbotus flying gecko. Similar adaptations to Ptychozoon are found in the two species of the gecko genus Cosymbotus. * Chrysopelea snakes. Five species of snake from Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and India. The paradise tree snake of southern Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo, Philippines, and Sulawesi is the most capable glider of those snakes studied. It glides by stretching out its body sideways and opening its ribs so the belly is concave, and by making lateral slithering movements. It can remarkably glide up to and make 90 degree turns. Mammals Bats are the only freely flying mammals.Why Bats Are One of Evolution‚Äôs Greatest Puzzles. Paleontologists seek the ancestors that could explain how bats became the only flying mammals. A few other mammals can glide or parachute; the best known are flying squirrels and flying lemurs. * Flying squirrels (subfamily Petauristinae). There are more than 40 living species divided between 14 genera of flying squirrel. Flying squirrels are found in Asia (most species), North America (genus Glaucomys) and Europe (Siberian flying squirrel). They inhabit tropical, temperate, and even Subarctic environments. They tend to be nocturnal. When a flying squirrel wishes to cross to a tree that is further away than the distance possible by jumping, it extends the cartilage spur on its elbow or wrist. This opens out the flap of furry skin (the patagium) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. It glides spread-eagle and with its tail fluffed out like a parachute, and grips the tree with its claws when it lands. Flying squirrels have been reported to glide over . * Anomalures or scaly-tailed flying squirrels (family Anomaluridae). These brightly coloured African rodents are not squirrels but have evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by convergent evolution. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus Idiurus contains two particularly small species known as flying mice, but similarly they are not true mice. * Colugos or \\"flying lemurs\\" (order Dermoptera). There are two species of colugo. Despite their common name, colugos are not lemurs; true lemurs are primates. Molecular evidence suggests that colugos are a sister group to primates; however, some mammalogists suggest they are a sister group to bats. Found in Southeast Asia, the colugo is probably the mammal most adapted for gliding, with a patagium that is as large as geometrically possible. They can glide as far as with minimal loss of height. * Sifaka, a type of lemur, and possibly some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, indris, galagos and saki monkeys. Most notably, the sifaka, a type of lemur, has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having aerofoil properties.Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology: Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans)Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans) ‚Äì Tetrapod Zoology * Flying phalangers or wrist-winged gliders (subfamily Petaurinae).

Ltd., Sydney, 1975 found in Australia, and New Guinea. The gliding membranes are hardly noticeable until they jump. On jumping, the animal extends all four legs and stretches the loose folds of skin. The subfamily contains seven species. Of the six species in the genus Petaurus, the sugar glider and the Biak glider are the most common species. The lone species in the genus Gymnobelideus, Leadbeater's possum has only a vestigial gliding membrane. * Greater glider (Petauroides volans). The only species of the genus Petauroides of the family Pseudocheiridae. This marsupial is found in Australia, and was originally classed with the flying phalangers, but is now recognised as separate. Its flying membrane only extends to the elbow, rather than to the wrist as in Petaurinae. * Feather-tailed possums (family Acrobatidae). This family of marsupials contains two genera, each with one species. The feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), found in Australia is the size of a very small mouse and is the smallest mammalian glider. The feathertail possum (Distoechurus pennatus) is found in New Guinea, but does not glide. Both species have a stiff-haired feather-like tail. =Extinct= Reptiles * Extinct reptiles similar to Draco. There are a number of unrelated extinct lizard-like reptiles with similar \\"wings\\" to the Draco lizards. Icarosaurus, Coelurosauravus, Weigeltisaurus, Mecistotrachelos, and Kuehneosaurus. The largest of these, Kuehneosaurus, has a wingspan of , and was estimated to be able to glide about . * Sharovipterygidae. These strange reptiles from the Upper Triassic of Kyrgyzstan and Poland unusually had a membrane on their elongated hind limbs, extending their otherwise normal, flying-squirrel-like patagia significantly. The forelimbs are in contrast much smaller. * Longisquama insignis (possibly gliding/parachuting). This small reptile may have had long paired feather-like scales on its back, however it has been more recently argued that the scales form just a single dorsal frill. If paired, they may have been used for parachuting. \\"Everything you can make out is consistent with it being a small, tree-living, gliding animal, which is precisely the thing you'd expect birds to evolve out of,\\" says Larry Martin, senior curator at the Natural History Museum at the University of Kansas. * Hypuronector. This bizarre drepanosaur displays limb proportions, particularly the elongated forelimbs, that are consistent with a flying or gliding animal with patagia. Non-avian dinosaurs * Yi is unique among gliding dinosaurs for the development of membranous wings, unlike the feathered airfoils of other theropods. Much like modern anomalures it developed a bony rod to help support the wing, albeit on the wrist and not the elbow. Fish * Thoracopteridae is a lineage of Triassic flying fish-like Perleidiformes, having converted their pectoral and pelvic fins into broad wings very similar to those of their modern counterparts. The Ladinian genus Potanichthys is the oldest member of this clade, as well as the earliest aerial vertebrate known, suggesting that these fish began exploring aerial niches soon after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Volaticotherids predate bats as mammalian aeronauts by at least 110 million years Mammals * Volaticotherium antiquum. A gliding eutriconodont, long considered the earliest gliding mammal until the discovery of contemporary gliding haramiyidans. It lived around 164 million years ago and used a fur- covered skin membrane to glide through the air.BBC NEWS Science/Nature Earliest flying mammal discovered The closely related Argentoconodon is also thought to have been able to glide, based on postcranial similarities; it lived around 165 million years ago. * A gliding metatherian (possibly a marsupial) is known from the Paleocene of Itabora√≠, Brazil.Szalay, FS, Sargis, EJ, and Stafford, BJ (2000) \\"Small marsupial glider from the Paleocene of Itabora√≠, Brazil.\\" in * The haramiyidans Vilevolodon, Xianshou, Maiopatagium and Arboroharamiya had extensive patagia, highly convergent with those of colugos.

The project was developed to promote historic preservation by identifying, documenting, and publicizing threatened sites of historical significance in northwest Georgia. The first initiative of the group, undertaken in the Fall of 2005 was to create a catalog listing of such sites and to call greater attention to the issue of preservation and to save some of these valuable historic sites. The initial sites identified in Fall 2005 as being most \\"at- risk\\" have been posted at their web site and the project continues to solicit nominations for the 2006 catalog listing. Catalog Historic sites listed in the 2005 Catalog included the following: *Concord Baptist Church Cemetery - Established in 1832, the Concord Baptist Church Cemetery is one of the oldest in Cobb County. *DeSoto Theater - The first venue in the South to be designed and built for sound pictures is now threatened by a deteriorating roof and electrical system. *Gilmer County Courthouse - The Gilmer County Courthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places, and was demolished in January 2008. *Glover Tannery Ruins - The ruins of the 1845 Glover Tannery are threatened by neglect and road expansion. *Hyde Farm - In the 1830s, James Cooper Power and Rosa Dodd Power built a log home near the Chattahoochee River in Cobb County, GA, on what had recently been Cherokee Indian territory. *Kennesaw School - The 1938 Kennesaw School (the second school built on the site) is threatened by commercial development. *Manning-Smith House UPDATED!- This Greek revival home has been associated with several persons and events throughout its history. *Masonic Lodge #221 - One of only two Masonic Lodges listed on the Georgia Register of Historic Places and currently seeking a place on the National Register of Historic Places. *Nesbitt-Union Chapel Ruins - Ownership of the Nesbitt-Union Chapel property was resolved in Cobb Superior Court, when the Cobb County Commissioners were named trustees of the property.

(right) A dress shoe (U.S. English) is a shoe to be worn at smart casual or more formal events. A dress shoe is typically contrasted to an athletic shoe. Dress shoes are worn by many as their standard daily shoes, and are widely used in dance, for parties, and for special occasions. Men's dress shoes =Colors= Men's dress shoes (Derby type with open lacing). Possible colors include: *Black *Brown *Burgundy *Oxblood *Chestnut *Cordovan *White Men's dress shoes are most commonly black or brown. Cordovan or oxblood dress shoes are worn by men sometimes in the United States, while the other colors are worn by men of many nationalities. =Materials= Most men's dress shoes are made of leather, usually entirely, including the outers, lining, and sole, though for more durability at the expense of elegance, many shoes are made with rubber soles. Non-leather men's dress shoes are also available. Shoes are usually made with many pieces of leather, and the seams can be decorated in various ways; most revolve around some type of brogueing. Brogues have rows of decorative punching in patterns: full brogues, or wingtips (the standard American name), have a toe cap in a wavy shape, with punched patterns on various sections of the shoe; half brogues have a normal straight edged toe cap and less punching; finally, other terms such as quarter-brogue etc. may be used to describe progressively less brogueing. All of the standard styles below may be brogued. =Styles= Men's shoes are often categorised by their fastening, and the various possibilities are listed below in roughly descending order of formality. Oxfords Oxfords (British), or Balmorals (American), lace up and tie to keep them on the wearer's foot, and have a closed lacing, where the pieces of leather joined by the laces are sewn together at the bottom. Many Oxfords have an additional piece of leather sewn over the toe section, known as a toe cap. Oxfords are the standard shoe to wear with most suits. White Buck shoes are a variant of the oxford that are made of buckskin, and considered the companion to seersucker and other summer suit fabrics. 100px Monk shoes A monk shoe (also called a monkstrap) has no lacing, and is closed by a strap with a buckle. Monk shoes are typically regarded as less formal; they are often considered appropriate for business formal, but rarely appropriate with any kind of formal attire. 100px Derbies Derbies, or Bl√ºchers in America, are similar to Oxfords, but have open lacing. They are a little less formal, and are often worn in brown, with some brogueing. 100px Loafers Loafers, or slip-ons, come in both men's and women's styles. It is not unusual for a man's loafer to have a tassel, although this can be seen in women's varieties too. Loafers were originally men's shoes, and are usually thought of as such, although women do now wear them. Other styles In addition to the above, there are various less common types of footwear to accompany formalwear, such as the court shoe (also called opera shoe, or patent pumps) for eveningwear and the dress boot for daywear. Women's dress shoes =Colors= Women's dress shoes come in a variety of colors, which includes: *Black *Silver *Gold *Tan *White *Red *Yellow They may also match the color of the gown, dress or suit being worn. =Styles= Pumps Pumps come in a variety of colors and styles. They can have a rounded or pointed toe, and are usually made of leather. They have a heel of at least 5 cm (2 inches). Today, pumps have evolved beyond the classic working woman's shoe. Now, there are peep toe pumps, which have a small opening at the toes. There are also pumps with ankle straps. Not only have the styles evolved, the fabrics have as well. While almost all pumps used to be made of leather, pumps now come in a variety of materials, such as suede and wool. Slingbacks The slingback is similar to the pump in that it can have a rounded or pointed toe and usually has a heel, but it doesn't wrap all the way around the heel like pumps usually do. Instead, it has a narrow strap that is pulled up over the heel, leaving the rest of the heel exposed. Loafers Loafers are usually flat and typically thought of as both more masculine and comfortable than anything with a heel. The typical loafer has a round toe, and comes in darker colors, such as black or brown. A spin on the loafer is the cloak, which, like the loafer, is a slip-on shoe, but it has a heel and is considered a more \\"feminine\\" design. Mules Mules are shoes that slide onto the foot, and do not cover the heel or the back of the foot at all. These aren't considered dress shoes unless they have a heel. Ballet flats The ballet flat hadn't been a popular fashion trend until some time after the first few years of the 21st century. Taken from the art of ballet, as their name implies, they are flat shoes with a rounded toe, and come in many different colors and patterns. The classic ballet flat has a small bow on the toe, but this style has evolved to include varieties without bows. Sandals Any sandal that has a heel, many straps, or a shiny finish would probably be acceptable in a more formal atmosphere. Tunisian sandal with high heels While sandals are usually more casual, there are some sandals that can be worn with dress clothes. For example, any sandal that has a heel, many straps, or a shiny finish would probably be acceptable in a more formal atmosphere. A minor controversy erupted in 2005 when some members of Northwestern University's national champion women's lacrosse team visited the White House wearing flip-flops. Following the criticism, their footwear was eventually auctioned off on eBay to raise money for a young cancer patient, Jaclyn Murphy of Hopewell Junction, New York, who was befriended by the team. Nine pairs of flip-flops raised approximately $1,653. There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture -- many youth feel that flip-flops are more dressy and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style. The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flop sandals and has met with several US presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.

Chen Youliang besieged Nanchang with a large fleet on Lake Poyang, one of China's largest freshwater lakes, and Zhu Yuanzhang met his force with a smaller fleet. After an inconclusive engagement exchanging fire, Zhu employed fire ships to burn the enemy tower ships and destroyed their fleet. This was the last major battle of the rebellion prior to the rise of the Ming dynasty.  Background  On 30 August, the forces of Chen Han conducted a major amphibious assault on Nanchang with a hundred vessels and several hundred troops. The town of Nanchang was strategically located to guard Lake Poyang, which connected the Yangzi with other river basins. During the early 1360s Zhu Yuanzhang held key garrisons on the lake and administered them from Nanjing 560 kilometers downriver. Chen Youliang tried to deposit his troops on the city walls with \\"tower ships\\". This proved futile as the city defenders simply moved the walls back and Chen was forced to personally lead an assault on the city gates. They were repelled with a barrage of cannonfire and driven back. After this failure, Chen set up a blockade, determined to starve out the defenders, but a small fishing boat managed to slip out and reached Nanjing in time to warn Zhu Yuanzhang.  The battle  right Zhu Yuanzhang's fleet arrived at Poyang Lake on 29 August with a force only a third the size of Chen's army. According to one Ming source, Zhu's forces arrived armed with \\"fire bombs, fire guns, fire arrows, fire seeds [probably grenades], large and small fire lances, large and small 'commander' fire-tubes, large and small iron bombs, rockets.\\" This shows that older gunpowder weapons co-existed alongside guns, and proto-guns such as fire lances were not supplanted until after early Ming. A new weapon called the \\"No Alternative\\" was also mentioned. The No Alternative was \\"made from a circular reed mat about five inches around and seven feet long that was pasted over with red paper and bound together with silk and hemp‚Äî stuffed inside it was gunpowder twisted in with bullets and all kinds of [subsidiary] gunpowder weapons.\\" It was hung from a pole on the foremast, and when an enemy ship came into close range, the fuse was lit, and the weapon would supposedly fall onto the enemy ship, at which point things inside shot out \\"and burned everything to bits, with no hope of salvation.\\" On 30 August, Zhu's fleet engaged Chen's under orders to \\"get close to the enemy's ships and first set off gunpowder weapons (ÁôºÁÅ´Âô®), then bows and crossbows, and finally attack their ships with short range weapons.\\" Fire bombs were hurled using naval trebuchets and the Ming succeeded in \\"burning twenty or more enemy vessels and killing or drowning many enemy troops,\\" but their own flagship also caught fire and hit a sandbar, forcing them to withdraw. On 31 August, the Ming rammed the enemy fleet with fire ships. While guns were used during the battle, ultimately they were not pivotal to success, and the battle was won using incendiary weapons. On 2 September, the two fleets engaged in battle again, but the tide turned on Chen's forces, and they were forced to withdraw. Afterwards, Zhu's fleet settled into a blockade for another month until they employed fire ships again on 4 October, destroying the rest of Chen's fleet. Chen Youliang was killed when an arrow struck his head.  Aftermath  Chen Youliang was succeeded by his son, Chen Li, who surrendered to Zhu in 1364.Mingshi„ÄäÊòéÂè≤„Äã The Ming victory here cemented their position as the leading rebel group. Five years later, the Ming would overthrow the Yuan and take command over China. Zhu Yuanzhang then became the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty as Hongwu.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 16 October 2002. Chas returned on 21 September 2003. Chas was absent for six months in 2005, when Pargeter took maternity leave. She left temporarily on 5 June 2005, and returned full-time from 13 December 2005. In 2013, Pargeter announced that she would be taking a short break from the show in order to appear in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!. Pargeter was briefly recast for one episode on 20 December 2016 to provide an alternative physical appearance to the character through the eyes of dementia patient Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). Chas departed temporarily once again on 31 March 2017 when Pargeter took a second maternity leave. Pargeter confirmed her return to filming on 31 August 2017. Chas returned on 25 October 2017. Chas' main storyline focused on her turbulent relationship with Carl King (Tom Lister), discovering she has a half-sister Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams), rebuilding a relationship with her son Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) who she abandoned as a child, her relationship with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt), her affair with her niece Debbie Dingle's (Charley Webb) sadistic ex-partner Cameron Murray (Dominic Power), being held hostage in The Woolpack siege, her grief over the loss of her father Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine), sister Gennie and best friend Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), developing PTSD, discovering her son's childhood abuse at the hands of his father Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers), reuniting with her and Cain's mother Faith Dingle (Sally Dexter), discovering she is pregnant with Paddy's child, who won't survive birth, and losing her daughter, Grace and becoming pregnant again, with their second daughter, Eve. Storylines Chas first appears when she arrives in Emmerdale dressed as a nun for her cousin Marlon's (Mark Charnock) stag night. She is hired by her father, Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine), and ends the evening locked in the back of a van with Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). She moves in with the Dingles and gets a job as barmaid at The Woolpack. Chas has a son, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), with her ex-husband Gordon (Gerard Fletcher), whom she allowed custody. Aaron hates his mother, feeling that she had abandoned him. Aaron rejects Chas's attempts to make amends for this and after he deliberately tells her about Carl and Delilah's fling, she ceases contact in order for Gordon, Aaron and his new wife, Sandra, to become a proper family. Chas makes friends with Carl King (Tom Lister) shortly after he and his family move into Holdgate Farm. They share a bond due to the fact that they are both parental failures and begin dating. The attraction strengthens into love but Carl's family disapprove and send him away after Paul Marsden (Matthew Booth) dies but he later returns and they get together. Chas' relationship with Carl was never stable, and the couple go through numerous break-ups and reconciliations. Despite Chloe Atkinson's (Amy Nuttall) poison pen letter scheme, Tom and Rosemary's blackmail, Carl's guilt over murdering his father and marriage to Chas's former friend, Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver), the relationship survives but finally deteriorates upon Chas discovering Carl was sleeping with Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw). Heartbroken, she follows her second cousin Charity's (Emma Atkins) advice to persuade him to marry her and falsely claims to be pregnant. However, she steals the money meant for the wedding and jilts him at the altar, telling him that he should be grateful that she lied about expecting his child. Chas also develops a relationship with her half-sister, Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams). Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) tells her that Shadrach put Gennie up for adoption after her mother died in childbirth, believing he couldn't bring her home to his wife, Faith. After coming to terms with this, she helps her father write to Gennie and feels neglected when Shadrach seems obsessed with his new daughter. Chas and Gennie become friends and Chas advises Gennie on how to care for her mother. Chas also manages to rebuild her relationship with her son, Aaron (now Danny Miller). She discovers his whereabouts, with help from her cousin Marlon's wife, Donna (Verity Rushworth), who has arrested Aaron for drug offences. Initially he is not pleased to see her but after the Dingles rescue him from the McFarlanes, he moves in with them. Aaron is pleased when Chas stands up for him when Lisa (Jane Cox) throws him out for encouraging Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) to steal, so they move in with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). Initially, Chas enrolls him at the local school but he refuses to go and starts work at the garage with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). Eventually, Chas' friendship with Paddy develops into a serious relationship. Chas is unsure of the relationship's future but Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) encourages her. Unfortunately Carl, newly separated from Lexi, decides he still loves Chas. Chas later succumbs to Carl's advances, but Chas decides that she wants to improve her relationship with Paddy and keeps her night with Carl a secret. Infuriated with this, Carl tells Paddy of their one-night stand, leading Paddy to kick her and Aaron out. No one is pleased with Chas but only Katie and Debbie support her. Aaron insists she choose between him or Carl. Chas chooses Carl, moves back in with the Dingles but then soon moves back in with Paddy. Angry with Carl, Aaron disconnects the brakes on Carl's car, nearly killing Jimmy King (Nick Miles), his wife Nicola (Nicola Wheeler) and their newborn daughter, Angelica King, when they borrow the car. Horrified, Aaron runs Jimmy off the road to warn him and Chas loses her temper with Aaron, telling him that she wants nothing more to do with him. This incident has more of an effect on Aaron than Chas realises and makes him seriously rethink his behaviour. Though she continues to show concern for him, he resists allowing her back into his life. Paddy tells Chas that Aaron is gay, surprising her. She is devastated when Aaron attempts suicide but immediately supports him. After this, they slowly begin to reconcile. She is thrilled for him when he meets Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock) and they build a relationship, albeit a bit rocky. Chas convinces Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen), landlady of The Woolpack, that they would benefit if Chas bought into The Woolpack. After weeks of pestering, which include Chas helping out behind bar for free, Diane relents and in desperate need of the money, sells half The Woolpack to Chas. Chas becomes colleagues with Debbie's boyfriend Cameron Murray (Dominic Power), needing the money, and an attraction grows. They finally give in to temptation and have a steamy sex session in the cellar. Chas tells Cameron that it was a mistake but they later begin an affair. After a fight between Cain and Cameron led to an impregnated Debbie being accidentally injured, endangering her and the baby she's expecting, they realise they cannot be together and part ways. Chas is told by Bob in the cafe that Dan Spencer (Liam Fox) fancies her. She invites him to dinner and they become a couple. Chas proposes to Dan after several dates, but he declines. However, he changes his mind and as he proposes to her, Chas accepts. Carl takes Chas' phone and finds photos of her with Cameron, discovering her relationship with Cameron. He threatens to tell Debbie about the affair, unless he is given his money back. However, when Chas and Cameron refund the money, Carl reveals he still loves her and thinks she shouldn't marry Dan and Chas almost misses her hen night, arguing with him. Not long after marrying Dan, Chas tries to leave the village. Carl finds her and he tries to rape her but Chas picks up a brick and hits him over the head with it, before running back to the pub. Carl is later found dead and Chas believes she killed him. However, Cameron visited Carl soon after and as the pair had a heated confrontation, Cameron delivered the final attack, murdering him. Chas is then arrested for Carl's murder, facing trial. Debbie, wanting revenge for her affair with Cameron, takes to the stand against Chas, wanting her sent down in a bid to split up Chas and Cameron. Chas is found not guilty and returns to the village, much to the dislike of Debbie and Charity, with Debbie swearing to make Chas and Cameron's life a living hell. While on her way to a party, Chas takes a lift from Debbie, but she takes Chas to an abandoned barn and pulls a gun on her. She ties Chas to a wooden pillar and blindfolds her, she intimidates her so she can understand how angry she is for what Chas has done with Cameron. Cain and Charity then arrive, and at first it seems as though Cain is willing to let Debbie execute Chas, but he and Charity eventually talk Debbie into letting Chas go. After this incident, Chas returns to running The Woolpack, however customers avoid the pub, due to the atmosphere. Chas tries her best to regain the regulars, but she is unsuccessful. She takes out a loan against the pub to try to keep the business afloat, stating she is very close to bankruptcy, with mounting legal fees to pay also. Chas and Cameron continue their relationship and remain in the village. In July, Gennie suspects that Cameron and Debbie are having an affair, and warns Chas about it. However, Chas thinks Gennie is trying to tear them apart and dismisses her claims. Soon, Gennie's suspicions are confirmed when she records a conversation in which Cameron confesses to killing Carl to Debbie, and the pair rekindling their romance. Gennie intends to tell Chas, but later dies after being suffocated by Cameron in order to keep his secret following a car chase between her, Cameron and Debbie. At Gennie's funeral, Chas learns that Cameron has been having an affair with Debbie. Chas delivers an emotional eulogy and then marches out of the church. Later, Chas packs Cameron's bags and brings them to Debbie's home, where she tells them they are selfish and deserve each other. Debbie and Charity both soften towards Chas and Charity apologises to her for treating her coldly for her affair with Cameron. In September 2013, when Cameron's murderous crimes are exposed by Debbie and Chas, after gaining evidence from Gennie's phone, he is arrested and charged with the murders of Carl, Alex and Gennie. In October 2013, he manages to escape jail, gaining his passport and clothes. He then buys a ticket for a ferry, so people would assume he's left Yorkshire for good. However he doesn't attend the ferry. When Debbie, Chas and the other villagers are aware of his escape, they panic, with Debbie fearing the worst. Later on, Sarah is taken by Cameron, and is locked in a barn, assuring her that he will get Debbie and Jack, and go away as a family somewhere. She believes him, but when Zak and Moira are alerted of her disappearance, they look for her. Debbie and other villagers, including Chas, Diane and Zak, are in The Woolpack, panicking. They learn that Sarah has been found by Andy and Moira, but also know that Cameron is back and he breaks into The Woolpack, taking everyone hostage, knocking Marlon unconscious and leaving him in the cellar, where the flood water rises. Cameron accidentally shoots Alicia Harding (Natalie Anderson) in the stomach, and David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) begs Cameron to let her out, in need of medical assistance, as she is dying. He lets David and Alicia out, along with the rest of the villagers, except for Debbie and Chas. After Marlon gains consciousness, Debbie and Chas rush to the cellar, as they are engulfed by the water rising to the top. Cameron manages to get to the cellar and insists on him and Debbie drowning together. They float to below the water. As Debbie struggles, she manages to get out of Cameron's reach with Chas intact. As Cameron gasps for breath, trying to pull Debbie back in, he fails, as she is outside, safe. He grabs a bulb and because of the encounter with the water, he is electrocuted, and is finally killed, ending his wrath and getting his comeuppance. Debbie rushes to Zak, soaking wet and crying as he reassures her Cameron is where he belongs - in hell, ending The Woolpack siege and Cameron's life. Chas then decides to go and stay in Southern France with Aaron for a few months. In February 2014, Chas returns and quickly becomes romantically involved with James Barton (Bill Ward), who turns out to be Adam Barton's (Adam Thomas) biological father. When Chas discovers this, Adam's mother Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) goes to great lengths to make sure Chas does not tell her brother, Cain, who is married to Moira. She even locks her in The Woolpack cellar to make sure she does not tell anyone. The truth is revealed in April, however, when at Finn Barton's (Joe Gill) birthday party, an old tape recorder of the younger Bartons is played. In August 2014, Aaron returns to help his best friend Adam, who is involved in illegal dealings with Ross Barton (Michael Parr). Chas realises she misses Aaron so decides to hand him and Adam into the police, but Aaron stops her. Instead, Adam and Aaron both hand themselves in. Adam is granted bail but Aaron is not because he has already missed his court case. Eventually, he gets a suspended sentence and Aaron moves in with Chas in The Woolpack. In February 2015, Chas loses her best friend, Katie, in an accident at Wylie's Farm when Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley) pushed her during an argument and she fell through rotting floor. In his grief, Aaron bursts into tears and Chas comforts him and tells him that she needs him strong for her. The next day, she finds out that Robert and Aaron are having an affair so she slaps Aaron, which leads to Aaron ending the affair. She is furious when Tracy Shankley (Amy Walsh) disrespects Katie's memory, so she throws a drink over her and orders her to leave. Chas later accompanies Aaron on his running sessions, unaware that he is actually self-harming. When he goes missing after suffering a fall, Robert helps Chas find him; however, she threatens to tell his wife Chrissie White (Louise Marwood) about his affair with Aaron. In order to keep her silence, Robert contemplates killing Chas with a rock, but when they find Aaron, he throws the rock away. When they return to the village, Robert hires a hitman to make Chas disappear once and for all. However, when Chas later tells Robert that she is not going to tell Chrissie, and Aaron tells Robert that he is not always the best at dealing with things on his own and needs Chas and Paddy, Robert realises that he has made a big mistake. When he spots the hitman about to abduct Chas outside The Woolpack, Robert quickly stops him and pays him a large amount of money not to hurt Chas. Later, Chas is livid when she discovers that James has slept with his scheming ex-wife, Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney), leading to Chas throwing a drink over Emma and Aaron hitting James over the head with a glass bottle. In August 2015, while attending Debbie's wedding to Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan), Chas and the rest of her family are involved in a helicopter crash when a helicopter which Pete had hired as a surprise for Debbie is hit by a gas canister from an explosion caused by Chrissie, and the helicopter careers into the village hall. Chas is not seriously injured, and helps other villagers out of the rubble. Chas later confronts Chrissie when she sees her with a gun vowing to kill Robert after the truth about Katie's death is revealed. After Robert is shot while arguing with Chas, she immediately accuses Chrissie, believing the shooter was Aaron. In a flashback episode, the shooter is revealed to be Ross. Diane and Chas fall out over the shooting and a series of mysterious events beginning to occur at the Woolpack. Chas becomes convinced that Emma is stalking her but it's later revealed that Chas is the real culprit as she has been sleepwalking. Late one night, Chas believes the \\"intruder\\" has returned to the pub and picks up a knife for defense, accidentally stabbing Diane. She is overwhelmed with guilt and after hearing Cameron's voice in her head, she hands herself into the police, but is released on bail. When staying over at Cain's house, Chas has a psychotic episode where she hallucinates Robert, Carl, and Cameron. She flees into the woods but trips and hits her head on a rock, knocking her unconscious. She is found by Nicola and taken back to Aaron and Cain. By then, Emma has correctly diagnosed her with post traumatic stress disorder, resulting from years of built up stress from Cameron's reign of terror and Carl's murder, and triggered after she witnessed Robert being shot. In December 2015, as a result of the stabbing, it is discovered that Diane's cancer has returned in her stomach. While receiving chemotherapy, Diane encounters Gordon (now played by Gary Mavers), Chas' ex-husband and Aaron's father. Although initially reluctant, Gordon decides that he wants to meet Chas and Aaron again to try to make amends. Chas and Gordon start dating again behind Aaron's back, which upsets Aaron when he catches them together, and triggers Aaron's self-harming. Later, after confronting Chas about her and Gordon, Aaron prepares to leave the village. He collapses from sepsis as a result of his self-harming and is rushed to the hospital by Robert, unknown to Chas. Meanwhile, Diane puts her half of The Woolpack up for sale and Gordon offers to buy it, which Aaron learns about and is vehemently against, and after he confronts his father, Gordon breaks up with Chas. Chas takes out a loan so she can buy Diane out. Thinking that this is Gordon's doing, Aaron accuses Chas of getting back with Gordon, which causes Chas to tell Aaron to move out. Robert learns of this and tells Chas that Aaron is in a dark place and shouldn't be left on his own. After Cain tells Chas that he caught Aaron trying to burn himself on his birthday and that he believes Robert knows something, Chas pays Robert a visit where Robert tells Chas that Aaron is cutting himself again and that he ended up in hospital because of Gordon. Chas asks Robert what else he knows and Robert states that has to come from Aaron. The next day, after spending a day at the seaside, Aaron tells Chas his dad raped him. Chas hugs Aaron and tell him she will make everything better. The next day, Chas visits Gordon and confronts him about what he did to Aaron. Gordon lies that Aaron was actually abused by his football coach, but Chas refuses to believe him. As Chas is about to leave, Gordon blocks her way and threatens her. Gordon showed his dark side and admits to Chas to abusing Aaron. When Chas returns, Chas tells Cain about Aaron's abuse, leaving Cain horrified. Chas tells Cain to make Gordon suffer for what he did to Aaron. The next day, Moira asks Chas about Cain's whereabouts, which forces Chas to tell Aaron, that Cain had gone to see Gordon. They drive to Gordon's house where they stop Cain, from killing Gordon. In order to do so, Aaron tells Cain that he will call the police on Gordon. Aaron tells Chas to inform Paddy, Adam and the rest of the Dingles, and after Gordon threatens Aaron at the scrapyard, Chas convinces Aaron to take some time away from the village. The case against Gordon is running too slow for Chas' liking so she decides to take matters in her own hands. She goes to Gordon's house, and sprays \\"Paedo\\" on his car before Robert turns up. Robert warns Chas that she's making life much worse for Aaron. Chas returns after being given a warning for the vandalism and comes face to face with a furious Aaron who just found out. Aaron gives Chas an ultimatum, tell everyone Gordon is innocent or he will walk away but Chas blurts out to everybody what happened to Aaron, Chas confronts Cain after he appears to be ashamed of Aaron, now that his past is revealed but Cain explains that he feels that he is failing Aaron. During this time, Robert helps Aaron track down his stepmother Sandra and his half-sister, Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), to see if Sandra can back-up his story. The police inform Aaron that another male victim has come forward, which leads to Gordon going to the pub and accusing Chas for paying his neighbour Ryan Harred (George Sampson) to lie to the police and say he abused him, of which Chas has no idea of this. Gordon threatens and pins Chas against a wall and orders her to call Ryan to get him to retract his statement. Marlon walks in and grabs Gordon before the police arrive and take Gordon away. Later, Robert confesses to Chas that he was the person who paid Ryan. Chas is worried that this is going to hurt Aaron's case and is contemplating telling him what Robert has done, but the police arrive and tell Aaron that because of Ryan's statement, they believe that they now have a case. Some time later, Chas confesses to Aaron that Robert paid Ryan to lie to the police. Aaron breaks down and warns Robert if the case falls apart, he will blame it on him. Aaron visits Ryan to tell him to drop his statement, and Chas gets a visit from DS Wise (Neil Roberts) who told her the second witness has dropped his statement but they will charge Gordon anyway. Chas then reveals the excellent news to Aaron. On top of the court case, Chas also has to deal with the return of Charity. She is revealed to have bought Diane's half of the pub, and intends to give her the money in due time. However, as time itself drags on with no payment from Charity, Chas warns her not to screw Diane over. Diane's partner Doug Potts (Duncan Preston) does not trust Charity, especially as he is the one who shall be receiving Charity's payment due to Diane caring for her ill mother-in-law Annie (Sheila Mercier) in Spain. In April 2016, Chas supported Aaron in court. Aaron takes on the stand and brings questions about his mum's past relationship. Later, Chas went to confronts Gordon who told her he blames her for the way their son has turned out. The next day, Chas take on the stand. Gordon's barrister questions Chas on why Aaron still has the same surname as his alleged attacker. He quizzes Chas on her blaming herself for Aaron being messed up, suggesting she believes Aaron to alleviate her own guilt, but Chas hits back that the abuse has made her feel even more guilty for not protecting her son. The defence brings up Chas' PTSD and Aaron leaving for Ireland when she needed him most. Later, Aaron reassures Chas she did great but Chas apologizes. Aaron admits to Chas, Gordon's barrister was right about one thing, he doesn't want Gordon's name - so he is going to change it to Dingle. 2 days later, Gordon is found guilty of rape by the jury. In May 2016, DS Wise arrives at the village and tells Aaron, Chas and Liv that Gordon has been found dead in his prison cell the day after Gordon is sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. Chas confronts an upset Liv, who has been staying with Chas and Aaron at the pub. Later, Chas went to the garage and asks Cain if he got somebody to finished Gordon off. Cain tells her no but he had a feelings that Robert could be involved in Gordon's death. Chas and Cain went to the pub and tell Aaron that they believe Robert paid somebody to have Gordon killed. Aaron starts to believe that it could be true. They were unaware that Liv was listening upstairs. The next day, Chas and Aaron are left shocked to see DS Wise turn up after Liv texts him on Chas' phone. Liv tells DS Wise that Robert killed her dad but DS Wise tells her that Gordon took his life by hanging himself. A few weeks later, Chas, Aaron, Robert and Liv attended Gordon's funeral. Chas watched on as Aaron delivered his eulogy, telling Gordon he is going straight to hell. Shortly after, Aaron and Robert take Liv on holiday and in their absence, the stress of the last few months finally takes its toll on Chas and she starts having nightmares again. Emma convinces her that her PTSD has returned and Chas admits herself into a mental health clinic. She returns a few weeks later and is told that Aaron finally learnt the truth about Robert's shooting and informs her son that she knew the truth months ago but didn't tell him in order to protect him. In September 2016, Chas and Diane go to Butlers farm to take Moira out only to find out the devastating news that Holly has died from an overdose. Chas tells Cain to support his estranged wife, telling him she needs him. In October 2016, Aaron is admitted to hospital after he and Robert crashed into a lake. While waiting for news of Aaron's condition, Chas offers a consoling hug to Robert and is pleasantly surprised to discover he was planning on proposing to Aaron. She jokingly tells him they'll have a \\"big, gay wedding\\". Chas, Robert and Liv keep vigil at Aaron's bedside and Chas happily watches on as her son accepts Robert's proposal. The next day, Chas learns that James died following the recent motorway collision and offers her condolences to Adam. Two weeks later, Chas gathers with the rest of the village to pay their final respects to James. In January 2017, Chas is worried about Aaron when he is arrested for attacking Kasim Sabet (Ethan Kai). As she waits at the police station, she is reunited with DS Wise who offers to help but Paddy's interference causes him to back off and Chas is worried what will happen if her son goes to prison. Chas is shocked and angry when her estranged mother, Faith Dingle (Sally Dexter) turns up in the village and is quick to let her know what she thinks of her. She is skeptical when Faith claims to have donated ¬£20,000 anonymously to Sarah's cancer fund and is frustrated when Cain offers to pay for her lodgings at the B&B.; After Robert tells her he wants to prove his commitment to Aaron and Liv before Aaron goes to prison, Chas, with the help of the Dingles and Sugdens, organises a surprise wedding in The Woolpack. Just as the service gets underway the police show up looking for Faith in connection with the ¬£20,000. As chaos unfolds, Robert and Aaron sneak away on their own and exchange their vows in private before heading back to the pub to tell their guests. Chas is delighted for them but is furious with her mother for the trouble she caused and tells her to leave the village. The next day, Chas accompanies Aaron to court and returns soon after to tell Robert that he's been sentenced to 12 months in prison, leaving her new son in law devastated. Chas returns from Prague to the shocking news that Aaron has been taking drugs in prison as well as the fact that Robert had sex with Rebecca White (Emily Head). Livid, Chas slaps him before ordering him to stay away from Aaron and Liv. Chas later slaps Rebecca for sleeping with Robert. The next day, Robert tells Chas that Aarons appeal was successful and he'll be released in a few weeks. At the prison, Chas is concerned about her son's fragile state of mind and decides to interject just as Robert is about to confess to Aaron about Rebecca. Back at the pub, she insists she only covered for him for Aaron's sake and warns him to make sure Rebecca doesn't say anything. While still awaiting Aaron's return from prison, Chas receives a phone call from Liv's aunt, who reveals that Liv's mother Sandra is in a coma after suffering an accident abroad. While reluctant, Chas opts to escort Liv to Ireland to see Sandra. Later in the year, Liv returns home while Chas remains in Ireland to look after a recovering Sandra. Chas returns to Emmerdale in October 2017 and immediately reunites with Paddy. She also finally makes up with her mother Faith after years of being estranged and hostile. She is also furious to find out she owes money to save The Woolpack pub thanks to Charity and Debbie, after her signature was forged. Upon her return, Chas and Paddy get back together. In early 2018, she learns that she is pregnant. Development =Prison life and affair= Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy confirmed that Chas Dingle would begin a steamy affair with Cameron Murray (Dominic Power), the boyfriend of her niece Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). The pair's attraction ignites after Cameron is employed at the Woolpack and later succumb as their love strengthens. However, back in the summer, Chas' half sister Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams) discovered that half-sister Chas was having an affair with Cameron, but she ultimately decided to conceal her discovery upon the illicit couple agreeing to end the fling. The latest twist begins as Chas plays with fire by suggesting that Cameron should meet her at Gennie's place as nobody will be in. However, as the pair passionately kiss in the house, the front door suddenly opens and Gennie catches them red-handed! Sian Reese- Williams hinted that Gennie may be later involved with protecting her secret, commenting: \\"Nothing ever goes unpunished in soapland, does it? I'm sure that this won't, either. Gennie's role in keeping the secret will be brought up again, I'm sure. It's lurking in the background!\\" As Emmerdale's 40th anniversary episodes aired, Debbie, along with parents Cain Dingle and Charity Sharma, finally uncovered Chas' affair with Cameron, marking the climax of one of the biggest stories in Emmerdale's history. =Temporary departure (2017)= On 31 October 2016, Pargeter announced she was pregnant, and as such the character of Chas would be temporarily written out in 2017. Chas made her final appearance in the episode broadcast 31 March 2017, alongside actress Isobel Steele, who portrayed Olivia Flaherty, as Steele was also leaving temporarily to take her GCSE's. Pargeter gave birth to twin daughters in April 2017, and she returned to filming in August 2017. Chas made her on-screen return to the programme on 25 October 2017. =Pregnancy and daughter's death= In late 2017, producers reunited Chas and Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). A few months later, Chas discovers she is pregnant. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy observed, \\"It's obvious why the Emmerdale writers love these two together ‚Äì they have a strong bond, a shared history, and are first and foremost best mates who are not afraid to take the mickey out of each other. We've watched them co-parent Aaron over the years, but to see them have a biological child would be a whole new world.\\" Chas initially decides to have an abortion, but she changes her mind while she is at the clinic and tells Paddy that she wants to be a mother again. In May 2018, Chas attends a scan alone, as she has mixed up the dates, and the sonographer notices something wrong with the baby. Chas is then informed that her baby has bilateral renal agenesis, a fatal condition in which the kidneys do not develop properly. Grace's birth takes place during an \\"experimental episode\\", in which Paddy imagines he and Chas have taken their daughter on a trip. Scenes show Grace when she is one, four, and 12 years old. Pargeter explained, \\"It's the kind of things they would have done with her if she'd have still been around ‚Äì it's in their heads in the delivery room after she's just been born. They're thinking about all of the things that they won't get to do with her. They kind of go there with her in their minds.\\" Pargeter believed the episode needed some \\"lightness\\" because of how sad the rest of the storyline is. Grace dies in Chas' arms at the end of the episode. Reception On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Chas and Cameron's affair was voted fourth in the \\"Best Storyline\\" category, receiving 8.9% of the vote. Pargeter was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" award at The British Soap Awards 2013, and was also nominated for the same award in 2014, although she did not win. For her portrayal of Chas, Pargeter won the accolade for Best Soap Actor (Female) at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. In 2019, Pargeter received a National Television Awards nomination in the Serial Drama Performance category for her portrayal of Chas.

It is based on the Brazilian market Volkswagen Variant. Origins of the project In the 1970s, the Brazilian market was closed for imports. The only sports car officially made there was the aging (and by then retired) Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, and its successor, the Karmann Ghia TC. Only independent car makers were able to fill the gap, notably Puma, Santa Matilde and Miura. =\\"Project X\\"= The Volkswagen subsidiary in Brazil always had some degree of independence from Wolfsburg, so in 1969 they decided to start a new project of their own. A team led by Mr. Schiemann and supported by Rudolf Leiding (the CEO of the subsidiary and later of the entire company), along with his wife Helga Leiding and the designer of the SP2, Marcio Piancastelli, started work on a project they called \\"Project X\\". They presented a prototype in 1971, but it would take another year before the car reached production. Specifications The SP2 was built on the frame of a Variant, with the same Volkswagen air-cooled engine, but upgraded to 1,700 cc. It developed , propelling the car from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in around 16 seconds according to period tests and to a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph). Fuel economy is . When the car was presented, it quickly drew media attention, with its many improvements over the local \\"air cooled\\" VW line, an impressive interior, its many extra features and its superb finishing. The name officially stands for \\"S√£o Paulo\\", but locals gave it the nickname \\"Sem Pot√™ncia\\", which is Portuguese for \\"without power\\". Decline A car named SP1 was also built, similar in almost every aspects but the engine, logo and a few trim items. However, due to its very poor performance ( from a 1,600 cc engine), it was soon discontinued, after only 88 units were built. Despite being praised by critics for its looks, the SP2 failed to beat its main competitor, the Puma, in the performance category. Although they used similar engines, the fiberglass-bodied Puma was much lighter. This resulted in low sales, and the SP2 was discontinued in February 1976. In total, 10,205 units were made; 670 were exported, of which 155 went to Nigeria. Only one model was delivered to Europe, Portugal. The car is now sought as a valuable collector's item. A white SP2 is displayed in AutoMuseum Volkswagen. While prices during the production time frame were roughly the same as the Beetle, the price of a well-preserved example today is considerably higher than other VW models of its age. alt= SP3 The SP3 concept was an attempt to resolve SP's main problem, lack of engine power, was called \\"SP3 project\\". It would be basically an SP2, but with a 1.8L EA-827 (AP in Brazil) engine, water-cooled, 8,5:1, SAE at 6,000 rpm and twin carburetors, all \\"borrowed\\" from the Brazilian version of the Passat TS. Although nothing came of the factory project, a prototype was made by Dacon who also offered a (prohibitively expensive) conversion kit.

Many are parthenogenic; males are very rare, however, at least in North American species, and have a somewhat different venation than do the females.Smith, K.G.V.

Saunders College Publishing. wing venation (male) Spear-winged flies are common in moist, shady, grassy areas, where the larvae are found within decaying vegetation. One species, Lonchoptera bifurcata, is cosmopolitan in distribution, and may have been transported via shipments of vegetables. Description For terms see Morphology of Diptera. The Lonchopteridae are minute, slender flies with long wings which are pointed at the apex. The head is rounded, with the outer vertical bristles, inner vertical bristles, ocellar bristles, interfrontal bristles, and bristles along the margin of the broad mouth very well developed. The mesonotum and scutellum and legs have well developed bristles. The radial vein R has three branches (R1, R2+3, R4+5). The median vein M is furcate (M1, M2). The anal vein A merges with the cubital vein Cu (female) or terminates freely (male). Systematics They are usually placed in the superfamily of flat-footed flies and allies (Platypezoidea). If the Platypezoidea are restricted to the flat-footed flies sensu stricto, the spear-winged flies are united with the Ironomyiidae and the coffin and scuttle flies (Phoridae) as Phoroidea.

Karl Otto Bonnier A family tree with some of Gerhard Bonnier's descendants. The earliest known member of the patriarchal line of the family was a cloth salesman named Jacob Schye (born 1674), who was from the town of Sobƒõdruhy (Soborten) in Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic). His son, the jeweler L√∂bel Schie (1718‚Äì1790), fathered the jeweler and coin dealer L√∂bel Salomon Hirschel (born 1745). Hirschel's son, Gutkind Hirschel (1778‚Äì1862), moved from Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1801 and changed his name to Gerhard Bonnier. There, Gerhard started a small book store in 1804. Gerhard's oldest son, Adolf Bonnier (1806‚Äì1867), moved to Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1827 to expand the family business. He started a library in the city the following year and another one in Stockholm a few years after. Adolf Bonnier started a publishing company, Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag in 1837 and his two younger brothers, David Felix Bonnier (1822‚Äì1881) and Albert Bonnier (1820‚Äì1900), soon moved to Stockholm to help with the business.

Its owners claim that it is \\"possibly Britain's most travelled preserved locomotive\\". Construction and use by the LMS 8233 was originally built in 1940 by the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, Works No. 24607 on the orders of the War Department, which had adopted the LMS Stanier Class 8F as its own standard. However, the Fall of France saw that it was not sent to mainland Europe with the British Expeditionary Force, as originally intended. Instead, it became LMS No. 8233 and was based out of Toton, Holbeck and Westhouses sheds. Export In 1941, No. 8233 was requisitioned by the War Department and sent to Persia (Iran), becoming Iranian State Railways No. 41-109, during which time, it derailed following a collision with a camel. In 1944, it was converted to oil-firing. In 1948 it was at Suez, needing a new firebox, and was almost scrapped, but was then returned to England in 1952 and overhauled at Derby Works. In 1954, the engine was not needed in the Middle East and went instead to the Longmoor Military Railway as WD. No. 500. British Rail and withdrawal In 1957, No. 500 was taken into British Railways stock as No. 48773. It was allocated initially to Polmadie (66A), and was withdrawn from there in 1962. However, it was reinstated in 1963 and transferred to Carlisle Kingmoor (12A). It was then transferred to Stockport (Edgeley, 9B) and Buxton (9L, though perhaps only on paper), and then to Bolton (9K) in September 1964. With the end of steam approaching, No. 48773 was transferred to the North West, moving to Rose Grove (10F) in July 1968. It worked its last main line train on 4 August 1968. During its last few years of service, No. 48773 had a diagonal yellow stripe painted on its cab side to indicate it was unable to operate south of Crewe as its top-feed was deemed to be out of gauge under the new 25 kV AC overhead electrification. However, as the locomotive's original War Department top-feed had been replaced by one of LMS pattern, enthusiasts have stated the cabside stripe was unnecessary since it would have in fact been within the loading gauge. Preservation In 1968 it was the subject of a late appeal to purchase it for preservation, it was then restored on the Severn Valley Railway. In 1975, it took part in the Shildon cavalcade as part of the 150 anniversary of Stockton and Darlington Railway. As of January 2014 it is on display in the Engine House, awaiting overhaul. In 1977 it was featured in the original BBC 1 drama Survivors. Now retired from a long faithful service, the loco will require a heavy overhaul, including mechanical and boiler work. It is thought she will need new tires and new inner firebox at least to start with.

Professional wrestling career One of Shadow's concerts caught the attention of the upstart wrestling company NWA: Total Nonstop Action, who then hired her. Shadow took on the stage name Goldylocks and as a backstage interviewer who openly backtalked the wrestlers and later became a valet with a rich-girl gimmick. She first managed Erik Watts, her kayfabe love interest. Later, Goldylocks broke up with Watts and Abyss became her protector. Goldylocks had Abyss wrestle Watts, announcing her money was up for grabs against Watts' contract. Abyss won, and she sold the contract to bring in rookie Alex Shelley. Goldylocks and her new \\"Baby Bear\\" Shelley went on to claim more contracts in future matches, using Abyss (who was treated as \\"extra luggage\\") to lay claim to Sonny Siaki, D-Ray 3000, and Shark Boy. In these tag matches, Goldylocks had Abyss do all the work and then brought in Shelley to pin their opponent. When Watts returned to TNA, a match was set up matching Watts, Siaki, and Desire against Abyss, Goldylocks, and Shelley. Abyss turned on Goldylocks in this match and finally left her.

It was long thought that these structures were unique to Scotland, but they have since been identified in several other parts of western and northern Europe. Vitrified forts are generally situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form seems to have been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of embankments. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast lines of ramparts, composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it. The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.Darvill, Timothy (2008). Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. . No lime or cement has been found in any of these structures, all of them presenting the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated by the fusion of the rocks of which they are built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is not equally complete in the various forts, or even in the walls of the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and calcined; in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance. It is not clear why or how the walls were subjected to vitrification. Some antiquarians have argued that it was done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure. Battle damage is also unlikely to be the cause, as the walls are thought to have been subjected to carefully maintained fires to ensure they were hot enough for vitrification to take place.Vitrification temperaturesMore information and the vitrification debate Most archaeologists now consider that vitrified forts are the product of deliberate destruction either following the capture of the site by an enemy force or by the occupants at the end of its active life as an act of ritual closure.Ralston 2006, 143-63 The process has no chronological significance and is found during both Iron Age and Early Medieval Forts in Scotland. Since John Williams, one of the earliest of British geologists, and author of The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom, first described these singular ruins in 1777, over 70 examples have been discovered in Scotland. The most remarkable are: *Dun Mac Sniachan (or Dun Mac Uisneachan), Argyll, the largest in area at 245 m by 50 m. *Benderloch, north of Oban; Sainte-Suzanne (Mayenne) Sainte- Suzanne (Mayenne) *Craig Phadraig, or Phadrick, near Inverness; *Ord Hill, North Kessock, near Inverness; ; *Dun Deardail (or Dundbhairdghall) in Glen Nevis; ; *Knock Farril (or Knockfarrel), near Strathpeffer, ; *Dun Creich, in Sutherland, ; *Finavon (or Finhaven), near Aberlemno ; *Barryhill, in Perthshire; *Laws, near Dundee, ; *Dunagoil and Burnt Islands, in Buteshire; *Mote of Mark, (Rockcliffe) near Rockcliffe, ; *Trusty's Hill, Anwoth, near Gatehouse of Fleet, ; *Tap o' Noth, Aberdeenshire; ; *Dunnideer Castle, Aberdeenshire, Aberdeenshire, *Cowdenknowes, in Berwickshire, . For a long time it was supposed that these forts were peculiar to Scotland; but they are found also in the Isle of Man (Cronk Sumark) County Londonderry and County Cavan, Ireland; in Upper Lusatia, Bohemia, Silesia, Saxony, and Thuringia; in the provinces on the Rhine, especially in the neighbourhood of the Nahe; in the Ucker Lake; in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted bricks; in Hungary; in several places in France, such as Ch√¢teauvieux (near Pionnat), P√©ran, La Courbe, Sainte-Suzanne, Puy de Gaudy, and Thauron; also rarely in the north of England. Barksdale is a vitrified hill-fort in Uppland, Sweden. Appearance in media =Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World= The 16 September 1980 episode of Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World features a segment in which the archaeologist Ian Ralston examines the mystery of the vitrified fort Tap o' Noth and tries to recreate how it might be accomplished by piling stones and setting a massive bonfire, repeating the work of V. Gordon Childe and Wallace Thorneycroft in the 1930s.Clarke, A. C, Welfare, S and Fairley, J. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. Collins, 1980, p.61. The experiment produced a few partially vitrified stones, but it was asserted that no answers were gleaned as to how large-scale forts could have been crafted with the approach tried in the programme.Arthur C.

The term \\"competence\\" first appeared in an article authored by R.W. White in 1959 as a concept for performance motivation. In 1970, Craig C. Lundberg defined the concept in \\"Planning the Executive Development Program\\". The term gained traction when in 1973, David McClelland wrote a seminal paper entitled, \\"Testing for Competence Rather Than for Intelligence\\". It has since been popularized by Richard Boyatzis and many others, such as T.F. Gilbert (1978) who used the concept in relationship to performance improvement. Its use varies widely, which leads to considerable misunderstanding. Some scholars see \\"competence\\" as a combination of practical and theoretical knowledge, cognitive skills, behavior and values used to improve performance; or as the state or quality of being adequately or well qualified, having the ability to perform a specific role. For instance, management competency might include systems thinking and emotional intelligence, and skills in influence and negotiation. Studies on competency indicate that competency covers a very complicated and extensive concept, and different scientists have different definitions of competency. In 1982, Zemek conducted a study on the definition of competence. He interviewed several specialists in the field of training to evaluate carefully what makes competence. After the interviews, he concluded: \\"There is no clear and unique agreement about what makes competency.\\" Here are several definitions of competency by various researchers: * Hayes (1979): Competences generally include knowledge, motivation, social characteristic and roles, or skills of one person in accordance with the demands of organizations of their clerks. * Boyatzis (1982): Competence lies in the individual's capacity which superposes the person's behavior with needed parameters as the results of this adaptation make the organization to hire him. * Albanese (1989): Competences are individual's characteristics which are used to effect on the organization's management. * Woodruff (1991): Competence is a combination of two topics of personal competence and merit at work. Personal merit is a concept which refers to the dimensions of artificial behavior in order to show the competence performance and merit at work depends on the competences of the person in his field. * Mansfield (1997): The personal specifications which effect on a better performance are called competence. * Standard (2001) ICB (IPMA Competence Baseline): Competence is a group of knowledge, personal attitudes, skills and related experiences which are needed for the person's success. * Rankin (2002): A collection of behaviors and skills which people are expected to show in their organization. * Unido (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) (2002): Competence is defined as knowledge, skill and specifications which can cause one person to act better, not considering his special proficiency in that job. * Industrial Development Organization of United States (2002): Competences are a collection of personal skills related to knowledge and personal specifications which can make competence in people without having practices and related specialized knowledge. * CRNBC (College Of Registered Nurses Of British Columbia) (2009): Competences are a collection of knowledge, skills, behavior and power of judging which can cause competence in people without having enough practice and specialized knowledge. * Hay group (2012): Measurable characteristics of a person which are related to efficient actions at work, organization and special culture. * The ARZESH Competency Model (2018): Competency is a series of knowledge, abilities, skills, experiences and behaviors, which leads to the effective performance of individual's activities. Competency is measurable and could be developed through training. It is also breakable into the smaller criteria. Competency is also used as a more general description of the requirements of human beings in organizations and communities. If someone is able to do required tasks at the target level of proficiency, they are \\"competent\\" in that area. Competency is sometimes thought of as being shown in action in a situation and context that might be different the next time a person has to act. In emergencies, competent people may react to a situation following behaviors they have previously found to succeed. To be competent a person would need to be able to interpret the situation in the context and to have a repertoire of possible actions to take and have trained in the possible actions in the repertoire, if this is relevant. Regardless of training, competency would grow through experience and the extent of an individual's capacity to learn and adapt. However, research has found that it is not easy to assess competencies and competence development. Overview The four stages of competence framework arranged as a pyramid Competency has different meanings, and remains one of the most diffuse terms in the management development sector, and the organizational and occupational literature. Competencies are also what people need to be successful in their jobs. Job competencies are not the same as job task. Competencies include all the related knowledge, skills, abilities, and attributes that form a person's job. This set of context-specific qualities is correlated with superior job performance and can be used as a standard against which to measure job performance as well as to develop, recruit, and hire employees. Competencies and competency models may be applicable to all employees in an organization or they may be position specific. Identifying employee competencies can contribute to improved organizational performance. They are most effective if they meet several critical standards, including linkage to, and leverage within an organization's human resource system. Core competencies differentiate an organization from its competition and create a company's competitive advantage in the marketplace. An organizational core competency is its strategic strength. Competencies provide organizations with a way to define in behavioral terms what it is that people need to do to produce the results that the organization desires, in a way that is in keep with its culture. By having competencies defined in the organization, it allows employees to know what they need to be productive. When properly defined, competencies, allows organizations to evaluate the extent to which behaviors employees are demonstrating and where they may be lacking. For competencies where employees are lacking, they can learn. This will allow organizations to know potentially what resources they may need to help the employee develop and learn those competencies. Competencies can distinguish and differentiate your organization from your competitors. While two organizations may be alike in financial results, the way in which the results were achieve could be different based on the competencies that fit their particular strategy and organizational culture. Lastly, competencies can provide a structured model that can be used to integrate management practices throughout the organization. Competencies that align their recruiting, performance management, training and development and reward practices to reinforce key behaviors that the organization values. Dreyfus and Dreyfus on competency development Dreyfus and Dreyfus introduced nomenclature for the levels of competence in competency development. The causative reasoning of such a language of levels of competency may be seen in their paper on Calculative Rationality titled, \\"From Socrates to Expert Systems: The Limits and Dangers of Calculative Rationality\\". The five levels proposed by Dreyfus and Dreyfus were: # Novice: Rule-based behaviour, strongly limited and inflexible # Experienced Beginner: Incorporates aspects of the situation # Practitioner: Acting consciously from long-term goals and plans # Knowledgeable practitioner: Sees the situation as a whole and acts from personal conviction # Expert: Has an intuitive understanding of the situation and zooms in on the central aspects The process of competency development is a lifelong series of doing and reflecting. As competencies apply to careers as well as jobs, lifelong competency development is linked with personal development as a management concept. And it requires a special environment, where the rules are necessary in order to introduce novices, but people at a more advanced level of competency will systematically break the rules if the situations requires it. This environment is synonymously described using terms such as learning organization, knowledge creation, self-organizing and empowerment. Within a specific organization or professional community, professional competency is frequently valued. They are usually the same competencies that must be demonstrated in a job interview. But today there is another way of looking at it: that there are general areas of occupational competency required to retain a post, or earn a promotion. For all organizations and communities there is a set of primary tasks that competent people have to contribute to all the time. For a university student, for example, the primary tasks could be: * Handling theory * Handling methods * Handling the information of the assignment The four general areas of competency are: # Meaning Competency: The person assessed must be able to identify with the purpose of the organization or community and act from the preferred future in accordance with the values of the organization or community. # Relation Competency: The ability to create and nurture connections to the stakeholders of the primary tasks must be shown. # Learning Competency: The person assessed must be able to create and look for situations that make it possible to experiment with the set of solutions that make it possible to complete the primary tasks and reflect on the experience. # Change Competency: The person assessed must be able to act in new ways when it will promote the purpose of the organization or community and make the preferred future come to life. McClelland and occupational competency The Occupational Competency movement was initiated by David McClelland in the 1960s with a view to moving away from traditional attempts to describe competency in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes and to focus instead on the specific self-image, values, traits, and motive dispositions (i.e. relatively enduring characteristics of people) that are found to consistently distinguish outstanding from typical performance in a given job or role. Different competencies predict outstanding performance in different roles, and that there is a limited number of competencies that predict outstanding performance in any given job or role. Thus, a trait that is a \\"competency\\" for one job might not predict outstanding performance in a different role. There is hence research on competencies needed in specific jobs or contexts. Nevertheless, there have been developments in research relating to the nature, development, and assessment of high-level competencies in homes, schools, and workplaces.Raven, J., & Stephenson, J. (Eds.). (2001). Competency in the Learning Society. New York: Peter Lang. Perez-Capdevila and labor competencies The most recent definition has been formalized by Javier Perez- Capdevila in 2017, who has written that the competences are fusions obtained from the complete mixture of the fuzzy sets of aptitudes and attitudes possessed by employees, both in a general and singular way. In these fusions, the degree of belonging to the resulting group expresses the extent to which these competencies are possessed. Benefits of competencies Competency models can help organizations align their initiatives to their overall business strategy. By aligning competencies to business strategies, organizations can better recruit and select employees for their organizations. Competencies have been become a precise way for employers to distinguish superior from average or below average performance. The reason for this is because competencies extend beyond measuring baseline characteristics and or skills used to define and assess job performance. In addition to recruitment and selection, a well sound Competency Model will help with performance management, succession planning and career development.

As such, it is important that they be defined in a measurable behavioral context in order to validate applicability and the degree of expertise (e.g. development of talent) Core competencies: Capabilities and/or technical expertise unique to an organization, i.e. core competencies differentiate an organization from its competition (e.g. the technologies, methodologies, strategies or processes of the organization that create competitive advantage in the marketplace). An organizational core competency is an organization's strategic strength. Functional competencies: Functional competencies are job-specific competencies that drive proven high-performance, quality results for a given position. They are often technical or operational in nature (e.g., \\"backing up a database\\" is a functional competency). Management competencies: Management competencies identify the specific attributes and capabilities that illustrate an individual's management potential. Unlike leadership characteristics, management characteristics can be learned and developed with the proper training and resources. Competencies in this category should demonstrate pertinent behaviors for management to be effective. Organizational competencies: The mission, vision, values, culture and core competencies of the organization that sets the tone and/or context in which the work of the organization is carried out (e.g. customer-driven, risk taking and cutting edge). How we treat the patient is part of the patient's treatment. Technical competencies: Depending on the position, both technical and performance capabilities should be weighed carefully as employment decisions are made. For example, organizations that tend to hire or promote solely on the basis of technical skills, i.e. to the exclusion of other competencies, may experience an increase in performance-related issues (e.g. systems software designs versus relationship management skills) Examples: Attention to detail Is alert in a high-risk environment; follows detailed procedures and ensures accuracy in documentation and data; carefully monitors gauges, instruments or processes; concentrates on routine work details; organizes and maintains a system of records.

Building a competency model Many Human Resource professionals are employing a competitive competency model to strengthen nearly every facet of talent management‚Äîfrom recruiting and performance management, to training and development, to succession planning and more. A job competency model is a comprehensive, behaviorally based job description that both potential and current employees and their managers can use to measure and manage performance and establish development plans. Often there is an accompanying visual representative competency profile as well (see, job profile template). Creating a competency framework is critical for both employee and system success. An organization cannot produce and develop superior performers without first identifying what superior performance is. In the traditional method, organizations develop behavioral interview questions, interview the best and worst performers, review the interview data (tracking and coding how frequently keywords and descriptions were repeated, selecting the SKAs that demonstrated best performance and named the competencies) One of the most common pitfalls that organizations stumble upon is that when creating a competency model they focus too much on job descriptions instead the behaviors of an employee. Experts say that the steps required to create a competency model include: #Gathering information about job roles. #Interviewing subject matter experts to discover current critical competencies and how they envision their roles changing in the future. #Identifying high-performer behaviors. #Creating, reviewing (or vetting) and delivering the competency model. Once the competency model has been created, the final step involves communicating how the organization plans to use the competency model to support initiatives such as recruiting, performance management, career development, succession planning as well as other HR business processes. The problem with the traditional method is the time that it takes to build. Agile Method for building a competency model Because skills are changing so rapidly, by the time the traditional method is completed, the competency model may already be out of date. For this reason, an agile method, designed to model top performers in a particular role, may be used.

This is also a potential reason why some organizations either don't have a competency model in place or don't have a complete and comprehensive competency model in place. Building a competency model requires careful study of the job, group, and organization of industry. The process often involves researching performance and success, interviewing high performing incumbents, conducting focus groups and surveys. When asked in a recent webcast hosted by the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM), 67 percent of webcast attendees indicated that hastily written job descriptions may be the root cause of incomplete competencies. Defining and compiling competencies is a long process that may sometimes require more effort and time than most organizations are willing to allocate. Instead of creating a competency model themselves, organizations are enlisting the help of specialist/consultants to assess their organization and create a unique competency model specific to their organization. There are many ways that organizations can outsource these functions. However, many competency models which have been created are usable in many companies. The most important of these are introduced: 1-Project Manager Competence Development Framework (PMCDF) PMCDF framework, studied since 1997, is the first standard of the Project Management Institute (PMI) addressing the issue of \\"improving performance of project staff\\". This standard is an important step in continuing the mission of this association for definition of the body of knowledge supporting project management profession and provision of standards for its application. PMCDF framework aims to help project managers and those interested in project management to manage their profession development. 2-Project Manager Competency Framework (ICB) The International Project Management Institute has divided the project management competencies into three categories: technical, behavioral and structural-environment. According to this standard, we need 46 elements to describe the competency of the project manager (a professional specialist who plans and controls the project). 3-National Competency Standards for Project Management (NCSPM) The AIPM (Austrian Institute for project management) was formed in 1976 as the project manager's forum and has been instrumental in progressing the profession of project management in Australia. The AIPM developed and documented their standard as the Australian national competency standards for project management. 4-The Model for selection of competent manager in constructional projects This model is designed based on the special conditions of constructional projects. In this model, first, the characteristics of a competent manager based on studies conducted on various standards and models of the world, and after studies on competency in the scientific and traditional attitudes, are divided into several categories and, finally, after identification of the criteria and measurable criteria and sub-criteria, with the help of the network analysis process, each of the criteria and sub- criteria is weighed in two different companies, and finally ranked among the identified factors and based on the weighted average of each of the sub- criteria, for selection of a competent manager among several volunteer managers, modeling is performed. The following figure shows the criteria and sub-criteria required for selection of the competent manager. 5-South African National Competency Model (SABPP) On October 16, 2012, a major human resources organization which was called SABPP created a National Competency Model for South Africa. SABPP is not only a professional organization in the field of Human resource researches but also active in the field of training logistics. This company has developed training programs in the field of management and industrial psychology. Therefore, in development of this model, the views of industrial psychologists have been used. Dr. Lydia Silichemith has headed the research group. According to his early studies, creation of SABPP's competency model is important because it describes the requirements for any professional in a variety of occupational contexts. 6-The Arzesh Competency Model Based on this model, a suitability model should follow the following objectives: 1- Merit 2\\\\. Educate future managers. The purpose of this model is to deserve and develop the culture of success in organizations. The value model tries to identify and develop, within several stages, the competencies of its forces: First step - Identify the capabilities of the organization's human resources Stage II - Identification of job competencies Third stage - Human Resource Ranking Step Four - Meritocracy: Use people in posts that are commensurate with their competencies. =Competency libraries= Organizations that don't have the time or resources to build to develop competencies can purchase comprehensive competency libraries online. These universal competencies are applicable to all organizations across functions. Organizations can then take these competencies and begin building a competency model. =Specialists/consultants= For organizations that find they want a specialist to help create a competency model, outsourcing the entire process is also possible. Through outsourcing, a specialist/consultant can work with your company to pinpoint the root causes of your workforce challenges. By identifying these workforce challenges, customized action plans can then be created to meet the specific needs. Typically, these solutions are unique to every organization's culture and challenges. Competency identification Competencies required for a post are identified through job analysis or task analysis, using techniques such as the critical incident technique, work diaries, and work sampling. A future focus is recommended for strategic reasons.

Background Lennon was involved in aviation since the age of 15, when he went for a short ride in a Curtiss Robin. He soon joined the Montreal Flying Club and began flying D.H. Gypsy Moths and early two-place Aeronca cabin monoplanes. He was educated in Canada at Edward VII School, Strathcona Academy, Montreal Technical School, McGill University and the University of Western Ontario, (London, Ontario). Involvement in Manufacturing Lennon entered the Canadian aircraft manufacturing industry and later moved to general manufacturing as an industrial engineer. Throughout his career, he continued to study aeronautics, particularly aircraft design, aviation texts, NACA and NASA reports and aviation periodicals. He tested many aeronautics theories by designing, building and flying nearly 25 experimental R/C models-miniatures of potential light aircraft. One model, the Seagull III was a flying boat with wide aerobatic capabilities. Lennon was a licensed pilot in the United States and Canada. Contributions in Literature Lennon was a contributing editor to Model Airplane News, Model Aviation, Model Builder, RC Modeler, Fly RC and RC Models and Electronics.

History The enuresis alarm methodology originated from French and German physicians in the first decade of the 20th century. Meinhard von Pfaundler, a German pediatrician made the discovery accidentally, with the original intention to create an alarm device that would notify nursing staff when a child had bed wetting and needed to be changed, showing the device to have a significant therapeutic advantages after a certain time of use. Despite early success, the treatment was not developed until the 1930s by two independent groups of psychologists: Orval Mowrer and Willie Mae Mowrer (1938) and John Morgan and Frances Witmer (1939). Mowrer used a modified Pfaundler alarm device with 30 children (ages 3‚Äì13 years) showing empirical success of the bell and pad method as a treatment for nocturnal enuresis, with the maximum time required to accomplish the treatment not exceeding two months.  Treatment process The individual places the sensor (usually located in briefs or underwear) and turns the alarm device on (there are various types of alarms) before going to sleep. The enuresis alarm is triggered when a sensor in the sheets or night clothes becomes wet with urine, setting off an auditory signal with the intention of causing the individual to wake, cease voiding, and arise to void. Parents are advised to wake their child when the alarm is activated‚Äîotherwise, children are prone to turn it off and go back to sleep. It is highly suggested that during treatment the alarm should be worn every night. The treatment effect and response are not immediate and treatment should be continued for 2‚Äì3 months or until the child is dry for 14 consecutive nights (whichever comes first). There may be cultural differences in its acceptability, as it may be highly disruptive for the household and may require a significant commitment of time and effort. The family must be motivated and adhere to this therapy if it is to be successful so they should be preemptively apprised of likely difficulties, but assured the first few weeks are the most troublesome. If necessary, doctors should monitor the child‚Äôs progress early to address any problems and facilitate adherence. Conditioning The enuresis alarm utilizes both classical and operant conditioning to provide a means of causing the sleeping individual to be regularly awakened immediately after the onset of urination so they can void in the toilet and prevent bed wetting. =Classical conditioning= The classical conditioning paradigm components for the bell and pad method are the following: The unconditioned stimulus (US) is the awakening stimulus or the alarm sound, the unconditioned response (UR) is the awakening response and sphincter contraction, the neutral stimulus (NS) is the feeling produced by bladder distention (feeling of having a full bladder), the conditioned stimulus (CS) is the feeling produced by bladder distention, and the conditioned response (CR) is the awakening response and sphincter contraction. Initially the individual experiences the alarm sounding (activated by urination) (US) eliciting the awakening response and sphincter contraction (UR) to wake up, stop urinating, and travel to the bathroom. After continued pairing of the alarm sound (US) with the feeling of a full bladder (NS), the previous NS of feeling a full bladder becomes the CS and elicits the waking response (CR) of waking up to go use the bathroom and urinate. =Operant conditioning= In the operant conditioning paradigm the alarm sound serves as a noxious stimuli added to the environment, effectively implementing a positive punishment procedure whenever the individual activates the alarm by urinating. This eventually causes an avoidance response from the individual, maintain the behavior through negative reinforcement by avoiding the alarm sound altogether. In the future the individual wakes up to urinate and avoids wetting the bed. =Conditioning theory dissonance= Most researchers of the enuresis alarm credit the treatment effect to the classical conditioning paradigm as was explained in the original research by Mowrer. However, some researchers have noted an important difference between conditioning treatment and the usual classical conditioning treatment. In typical classical conditioning, when the unconditioned stimulus is withdrawn, the conditioned response gradually weakens with repeated application of the conditioned stimulus. In successful cases of the enuresis alarm conditioning treatment, no extinction occurs following the withdrawal of the alarm stimulus (US). This suggests that the conditioning treatment may follow the operant avoidance conditioning rather than the classical conditioning pattern. In addition, a strictly classical conditioning explanation fails to incorporate that social positive reinforcement may be introduced to the individuals environment from family members from signs of improvement taking into account social learning. However, it is theorized that classical and operant conditioning both contribute to the effectiveness of the treatment. Sensors A urine sensor is a necessary part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two electricity conductors separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, so as not to be dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this concept. Note that unless the urine reaches the sensor mechanism and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine absorbing medium. The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, magnetic attachment, and wiring sewed into special briefs. Stainless steel clips are most often used and are easily attached and detached to the briefs at the point of urination. Flat surface sensors require sticky tape or pads to be attached to the briefs. The magnetic sensors are magnetically attached to the briefs. Magnetic sensors and wired briefs are typically used for wireless alarms. Another consideration is how the sensor (through its cable, if applicable) is attached to its alarm or transmitter in the case of wired alarms or wireless alarms. Some wireless alarms are truly wireless, with the transmitter being part of the sensor and completely self-contained. For wired alarms, the sensor's wire (or cable) runs from the sensor (located at the point of urination) underneath the user's pajama shirt to wherever the alarm is located on the body (frequently on the collar of the pajama shirt, so that it is close to the ear). The attachment mechanism to the alarm, through which the electric current flows to the alarm, is important. If it is easily detached (unintentionally comes out from the alarm during use) the alarm may not be triggered. Most connectors are plastic telephone jacks which are very unlikely to be detached unintentionally (RJ-11, RJ-12, 616E, etc.). Types of alarms =Wearable alarms= Wireless Bedwetting Alarm A wearable alarm is a design in which the child or patient wears the moisture sensor in or on their underwear or pajamas. This type of sensor will detect moisture almost immediately. The sensor is attached to the alarm unit with an electricity conducting wire or cable that can be worn under the shirt. Many wearable alarms vibrate as well as sound to wake deep sleepers. =Wireless alarms= A wireless bedwetting alarm is one in which the sensor and the alarm unit communicate by a means other than a wire. The transmitter, which senses the moisture, is directly attached to the child's underwear. The signal is transmitted wirelessly to a unit that is across the room from the child or an alarm unit in the child's room. Once the alarm unit is activated, it is necessary to get out of bed to turn it off. New wireless alarms add the convenience of also sounding an alarm in the caregiver's room, allowing both patient and caregiver to sleep in the comfort and privacy of their own beds and rooms. Multiple alarms in the house can further increase convenience. Remote controls can facilitate using the wireless bedwetting alarm system, and be especially convenient for the parent or caregiver. =Pad-type alarms= Bell-and pad alarms do not attach to the child in any way. The moisture sensor is in the form of a pad or mat that the child sleeps on top of. The pad detects moisture after urine has leaked onto it. The alarm unit is connected with a cord and usually sits on the bedside stand. This alarm requires a larger amount of urine before the sensor can detect moisture. The person must be on the pad for it to sense moisture. Factors of treatment success Successful outcome of enuresis alarm treatment is associated with optimal motivation of the child and family, higher frequency of dry nights, and the absence of adverse environmental factors and psychiatric disorders. Reduced efficacy of the treatment is associated with lack of concern shown by the individual, lack of supervision, inconsistent use, family stress, abnormal scores on behavioral checklists, psychiatric disorders in the individual, failure to awaken in response to the alarm, unsatisfactory housing conditions, and more than one wetting episode per night.

The story slyly satirizes fashionable society in fin-de-si√®cle England. The central characters are an American brother and sister who both entertain and live off this society, which has grown bland and bored and almost exhausted. Plot summary Mamie Cutter is an American living in London. She supports herself by getting questionable people into fashionable social circles, in return for a fee. Her worthless but personable half-brother Scott Homer turns up at her apartment looking for a handout. A particularly tough case for Mamie is a certain Mrs. Medwin, who is apparently beyond the pale even by the lax standards of current English society. But Scott comes to Mamie's rescue by charming the snooty Lady Wantrigde into inviting Mrs. Medwin to one of her exclusive parties. Mamie collects her fee and Scott becomes an unexpected social success. Major themes In his Notebooks James bestowed the adjective \\"cynical\\" on his idea for this story, and it's hard to disagree. Never did James describe English high society with a more sarcastic tone than in this worldly-wise tale of how jaded socialites will accept anything and anybody for the sake of an even slightly fresh experience. Scott Homer puts it in his usual blunt way: \\"The bigger bugs they are the more they're on the lookout...for anything that will help them to live...They're dead, don't you see? And WE'RE alive.\\" James endows Scott with enough charm to make his success with the \\"bugs\\" believable, and Mamie doesn't mind collecting the financial rewards. The story's brevity (under eight thousand words) and simplicity of style help keep its sardonic message from seeming clumsy or forced. The satirical magazine Punch was a perfect vehicle for this astringent view of hoity-toity social circles. Critical evaluation Critics such as Clifton Fadiman, Edward Wagenknecht and Robert Gale have been quite kind to this \\"little cynical comedy\\", as its author dubbed it. James handles his material with the lightest touch, never blundering into a ham-handed condemnation of social hypocrisy. Abundant humor makes it clear that James is unshockable and amused. The idea for the tale came from a few bits of gossip, and the finished product shows how the thoroughly experienced novelist could turn the smallest hint into a minor masterpiece. Keeping the story as brief as possible for commercial and artistic reasons, James still gets his characters into sharp outline and makes his satire memorable.

Biography He was born in Florence to an artistic family. His father, Filippo, was a portrait painter; his sister Alessandra also became a painter; and another sister, Angelica, was a singer in the court of Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.Langmuir 2008 Furini's early training was by Matteo Rosselli (whose other pupils include Lorenzo Lippi and Baldassare Franceschini), though Furini is also described as influenced by Domenico Passignano and Giovanni Biliverti.Cantelli 1972 He befriended Giovanni da San Giovanni. Traveling to Rome in 1619, he also would have been exposed to the influence of Caravaggio and his followers. Among his pupils are Simone PignoniWittkower, p. 1993:345 and Giovanni Battista Galestruzzi. Furini's work reflects the tension faced by the conservative, mannerist style of Florence when confronting then novel Baroque styles. He is a painter of biblical and mythological set-pieces with a strong use of the misty sfumato technique. In the 1630s his style paralleled that of Guido Reni. An important early work, Hylas and the Nymphs (1630), features six female nudes that attest to the importance Furini placed upon drawing from life.Campbell 1972 Furini became a priest in 1633 for the parish of Sant'Ansano in Mugello.Cappelletti Freedberg describes Furini's style as filled with \\"morbid sensuality\\". His frequent use of disrobed females is discordant with his excessive religious sentimentality, and his polished stylization and poses are at odds with his aim of expressing highly emotional states. His stylistic choices did not go unnoticed by more puritanical contemporary biographers like Baldinucci. Pignoni also mirrored this style in his works. One of his masterpieces, and not reflective of the style of his canvases, is the airy fresco in Palazzo Pitti, where on order of Ferdinando II de' Medici, between 1639 and 1642, Furini frescoed two large lunettes depicting the Platonic Academy of Careggi and the Allegory of the Death of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The frescoes can be seen as a response to Pietro da Cortona, who was at work in the palazzo during these years. Furini traveled to Rome again in the year before his death in 1646. Legacy In Robert Browning's series of poems titled Parleyings with certain people of importance in their day, the poet envisions an explanation by Furini that refutes the published assertion by Filippo Baldinucci that (on his deathbed) he had ordered all his nude paintings be destroyed. For Browning, Furini's disrobement of his subjects is emblematic of a courageous search for the hidden truth. Modern research has demonstrated that Furini did not abandon his sensual painting subjects on entering the priesthood. Furini was rediscovered in the early 20th century by .Stanghellini, Francesco Furini, Vita d'Arte 13 [1913). His scantily documented career was sketched by Elena Toesca (Furini, 1950) and brought into focus with an exhibition of his drawings at the Uffizi, 1972.The exhibition catalogue by Giuseppe Cantelli , Disegni di Francesco Furini e del suo ambiente (Florence: Oschki) 1972. Cantelli attributed seventy-two drawings in the Uffizi to his hand. Documents published by Gino Corti in Antichit√† Viva (Match-April 1971) appeared too late to be assimilated in the exhibition. Soon after, A. Barsanti recovered more biographical detail to flesh out the modest armature of dates in \\"Una vita inedita del Furini\\", Paragone 289, (1974), pp. 67‚Äì86.

Early life Koff, who is mixed-race and Jewish, was born in 1972 to a Tanzanian mother, Msindo Mwinyipembe, and an American father, David Koff, both documentary filmmakers focused on human rights issues. Her parents took her and her older brother, Kimera, with them around the world. She spent her childhood in England, Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, and the United States. By the time she was a teenager she had decided to study human osteology, which she did first in California. She earned her bachelor's degree in anthropology from Stanford University.Stanford Magazine Graduate school Koff went on to the master's program in forensic anthropology at the University of Arizona. She completed her masters degree in 1999 at the University of Nebraska, after combining her studies with working for the UN between 1996 and 2000. As a 23-year-old graduate student studying prehistoric skeletons in California, Koff joined a small team of UN scientists exhuming victims of the genocide in Rwanda. Her job was to find evidence to bring the perpetrators to trial, and to help relatives to identify their loved ones. Books Koff captured the events in her memoir The Bone Woman: Among the dead in Rwanda, Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo (Random House) which was published in 2004 in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Argentina, and Canada, 2005 in France and Denmark, 2006 in Norway, Italy, and Portugal, and 2007 in Poland.

It describes his arrest as a member of the Italian anti-fascist resistance during the Second World War, and his incarceration in the Auschwitz concentration camp (Monowitz) from February 1944 until the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945. Background to the memoir Primo Levi was born in 1919 in Turin. His forebears were Piedmontese Jews. He studied chemistry at the University of Turin, graduating cum laude in 1941, notwithstanding the restrictions imposed by Mussolini's racial laws. In 1942 he found a position with a Swiss drug company in Milan.Levi 2015, vol.1, p.xxv‚Äìxxix. With the German occupation of northern and central Italy in 1943, Levi joined a partisan group in Valle d'Aosta in the Alps.Levi 2015, vol.1, p.xxx. He was arrested in December 1943 and transported to Auschwitz in February 1944. He remained there until the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945. If This Is a Man recounts his experiences in the camp. Chapters *The Journey *On the Bottom *Initiation *Ka-Be *Our Nights *The Work *A Good Day *This Side of Good and Evil *The Drowned and the Saved *Chemistry Examination *The Canto of Ulysses *The Events of the Summer *In October 1944 the prisoners anticipate a 'selection': the Germans will send a proportion of the prisoners to the gas chambers to make room for new arrivals. No one knows the exact day on which it will take place; the prisoners reassure each other that surely it will not be they who will be selected. When it comes, the process is so perfunctory that it is almost a matter of chance who is chosen. *In Kraus Levi recalls the Hungarian working alongside him who has not grasped that in the camp hard work is not rewarded; not wasting energy is more likely to lead to survival. *Winter has arrived. Die Drei Leute vom Labor (\\"The Three Laboratory People\\") describes how Levi and two other prisoners are chosen to work in the laboratory. Its cleanliness and warmth contrasts with the rest of the bomb-ravaged and snow-covered camp. The presence of three healthy women makes the prisoners self-conscious about their own physical deterioration. *In The Last One Levi describes the audacious schemes he and Alberto devise to acquire goods to exchange for bread. At the end of the day the prisoners are assembled to witness the hanging of a man who has taken part in an uprising. At the moment of death he cries out \\"Comrades, I am the last!\\" The prisoners look on passively, robbed by now of any autonomy. *Written in the form of a diary The Story of Ten Days is the work's epilogue. Suffering with scarlet fever, Levi is admitted to the camp hospital. By now the arrival of the Red Army is imminent and the Germans decide to abandon the camp. Only the healthy prisoners are evacuated. Alberto leaves, Levi remains. The forced march of the departing prisoners will take almost all of them, including Alberto, to their deaths. Levi and two other prisoners set about helping the other patients in their barrack, scouring the abandoned camp for provisions. The Soviet troops arrive on 27 January 1945. Composition Levi began to write in February 1946, with a draft of what would become the final chapter recording his most recent memories of Auschwitz. According to Ian Thomson, Levi worked over the next ten months with concentrated energy and extreme facility. Levi told him that the words poured out of him 'like a flood which has been dammed and suddenly rushes forth'.Thomson (2003), p.229. In the daytime Levi was working at a paint factory north-east of Turin. Mostly he wrote in the evenings and late into the night, although Levi said that the chapter The Canto of Ulysses was written almost entirely in a single, half-hour lunch break.Thomson, pp.226 and 230‚Äî231. The first manuscript was completed in December 1946 and required considerable editorial work. His future wife, Lucia Morpurgo, helped him to shape the book, giving it a clear sense of direction.Thomson (2003), p.241. Publication Primo Levi In January 1947, the manuscript was initially rejected by Einaudi, with the writers Cesare Pavese and Natalia Ginzburg thinking it too early after the war for such an account. However Levi managed to find a smaller publisher, De Silva,Levi, Primo. Note to the Theatre version of If This Is a Man, pp. 23‚Äì25. who printed 2,500 copies of the book, 1,500 of which were sold, mostly in Levi's hometown of Turin. In 1955, Levi signed a contract with Einaudi for a new edition, which was published in 1958. The initial printing of 2000 copies was followed by a second of the same size.Levi 2015, vol. 1, p.xxxix. An English translation by Stuart Woolf was published in 1959. A German translation by Heinz Reidt appeared in 1961 (titled Ist das ein Mensch?) and a French edition in the same year. All translations were completed under Levi's close supervision. He was particularly careful to oversee the German translation, writing in The Drowned and the Saved: \\"I did not trust my German publisher. I wrote him an almost insolent letter: I warned him not to remove or change a single word in the text, and I insisted that he send me the manuscript of the translation in batches ... I wanted to check on not merely its lexical but also its inner faithfulness.\\"The Drowned and the Saved, p. 139, cited in Gordon 2007, p.157. Robert S. C. Gordon writes that Levi went on to develop a close relationship with Reidt.Gordon 2007, p. 157. The German edition contains a special preface addressed to the German people, which Levi said he wrote out of passionate necessity to remind them what they had done.The Drowned and the Saved (Italian title: I Sommersi e i Salvati) If This Is a Man is often published alongside Levi's second work of witness, The Truce (Italian title: La Tregua). Invocation The book is introduced by a poem. The construction \\"If ..\\" invites the reader to make a judgment. It alludes to the treatment of people as Untermenschen (German for \\"sub-humans\\"), and to Levi's examination of the degree to which it was possible for a prisoner in Auschwitz to retain his or her humanity. The poem explains the title and sets the theme of the book: humanity in the midst of inhumanity. The last part of the poem, beginning \\"meditate\\", explains Levi's purpose in having written it: to record what happened so that later generations will ponder (a more literal translation of meditare) the significance of the events he lived through. It also parallels the language of the V'ahavta, the Jewish prayer that commands followers to remember and pass on the teachings of their faith. Style The calm sobriety of Levi's prose style is all the more striking given the horrific nature of the events he describes. Levi explained in his 1976 Appendix to the work: \\"I thought that my word would be more credible and useful the more objective it appeared and the less impassioned it sounded; only in that way does the witness in court fulfil his function, which is to prepare the ground for the judge. It is you who are the judges.\\"Levi 2015, vol.1, p.169. He ascribed the clarity of his language to the habits acquired during his training as a chemist: \\"My model was that of the weekly reports, a normal practice in factories: they must be concise, precise and written in a language accessible to all levels of the firm's hierarchy.\\"Levi 2015, vol.1, p.199. Adaptation for radio In 1965 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired the 140-minute dramatic feature, \\"If This is a Man\\", George Whalley's adaptation of Stuart Woolf's translation. The broadcast was produced by John Reeves, who has written about the radio production.

This led to the design and manufacture of hardshell and softshell backpacks. Their hardshell backpacks are best known for their impact reduction capabilities (between 86% - 93% depending on the model), unusual design, and accompanying accessory range. They have received two Good Design Awards. In 2015, the company became part of the Point 65 Sweden and their product range was re-launched under the new brand name. Their flagship store & corporate headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden. History The creator of the Boblbee packs, industrial designer Jonas Blanking, has a background in the automotive and sports industries having worked with such companies as Alfa Romeo, Volvo, Porsche and sports-gear maker Salomon. As an outdoorsman, he had trouble with conventional backpack designs that left expensive electronics or paperwork vulnerable to damage in the event of an accident or inclement weather. He set out to design a new type of backpack, unlike those considered suitable for sports such as hiking and biking, that would have to be rigid, protective, and provide adequate volume. Blanking looked to the air cargo industry for the first iteration of the backpack, which led him to employ the use of aluminium and ABS plastics. Prototypes were developed in 1996. The first prototype featured a concept in which the rigid outer shell could be incorporated in such a way that the outside surface area is as useful as the internal volume. Fasteners located all over the pack let the wearer attach a skateboard or snowboard with simple straps that can be taken off with ease. Later, accessories were made to fit around the sides and the crevasse situated at the bottom of the pack for lumbar support. The concept was finalized in April 1998, leading to the birth of the Boblbee monocoque hardshell backpack, now known as the Megalopolis. Boblbee then went on to release several more hardshell & softshell designs, all with varying features for transporting sports equipment, camera gear, laptops & more. In July 2014 the company became part of Point 65 Sweden and moved its HQ from Malmo to Solna. In spring 2015 the complete range of products was relaunched under the new brand name 'Point 65'. Currently the backpacks are sold worldwide, through the official website or various authorised resellers. Megalopolis The Megalopolis was the first backpack released by Boblbee. It uses a design that reminds some of a toboggan or even a jetpack. The futuristic hardshell plastic form of the pack the Megalopolis (and the identical but smaller Peoples Delite) have appeared as accessories in movies such as Charlie's Angels, Hitch, Jason X, The Fast And The Furious, The Italian Job and Bicentennial Man. The original Megalopolis came in two versions, the Executive and Sport models. The difference between the two was the color selections - the Sport version has in-mold primary colors, whereas the Executive has been painted and lacquered in a myriad of colors. The Executive has a partition of the interior, where the Sport has a removable laptop sleeve instead of an actual laptop compartment. The Megalopolis Series was renamed the Boblbee GTO Series (20L & 25L packs) after the company became Point 65 Sweden. In 2016 the design was updated again and the GTO has been changed to the GTX series (today's current version). Target audience The Boblbee backpacks are built to withstand high impacts, protecting both the spine of the wearer and the contents of the pack. Motorcycle riders, skiers/snowboarders, mountain bikers or rock climbers are ideally suited to the extra security provided back protector and rigid outer shell. The packs are also widely used in urban situations, popular with cyclists, couriers, DJ's, business people & travellers to keep laptops or camera equipment protected while on-the-go. Popularity has been achieved particularly in Japan where a big portion of Boblbee items are sold. Boblbee Japan has a website separate from the main site which features products exclusive to that region.

It was built in the 12th century, and later strengthened using stones from nearby Hadrian's Wall, but began to fall into disrepair in the 17th century. The site is protected by Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument status. Meaning of name \\"Thirlwall\\" \\"Thirlwall\\" combines Middle English Thirl, contracted with wall; in context, reference and proximity to Roman-built Hadrian's Wall from which Thirlwall Castle was materially built. Thirl [as verb] means \\"perforated-\\" or [as noun] \\"bored- wall\\", from the Old English √æyrel, √æyrl, \\"a hole made through anything, an aperture, orifice\\" and weall, \\"wall\\". As used and described in an Atlantic Monthly article, it is referenced as \\"a small passage built into a wall to allow sheep but not cattle to pass through ... a thirl, or a thawl\\". In Greek, the word Thura \\"Œ∏œçœÅŒ± th√Ωra, [pronounced] thoo'-rah; apparently a primary word (compare \\"door\\"); a portal or entrance (the opening or the closure, literally or figuratively): \\"door, gate\\".Strong's Hebrew and Greek Dictionaries (entry # G2374) from Blue Letter Bible (US) https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs;=g2374 The middle English noun thirl likewise references a portal; a through passage, gate or door [thura] through which lambs enter in. Book of John (KJV), tenth chapter conveys this same meaning: \\"Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door [thura] of the sheep. I am the door [thura]: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.\\" (John 10:7;9). Thirl, corresponding identically in meaning to Greek thura, conjoined with wall then forms Thirlwall having reference to Roman-built Hadrian's Wall between Northeast England and Scotland in Northumbria. History The home of the Thirlwall family, the castle was fortified in about 1330 by John Thirlwall. In a survey of 1542 it was reported as in the ownership of Robert Thirlwall and in a 'measurable good' state of repair. Sir Percival Thirlwall of Thirlwall Castle was killed at the Battle of Bosworth whilst fighting in the Yorkist cause on 22 August 1485. He was Richard III's standard-bearer in the final charge at Bosworth. He held up the standard even after his legs had been cut from under him. Post medieval Eleanor Thirwall, the last of the Thirlwall family line, abandoned the castle as a residence and the estate passed to the Swinburne family by her 1738 marriage to Matthew Swinburne of Capheaton Hall. Swinburne sold the estate to the Earl of Carlisle for ¬£4000 in 1748. Thereafter the castle fell into decay. In 1832 and again in 1982 there were serious collapses of masonry. In 1999 the Northumberland National Park Authority took over the management of the castle, protecting it from further dereliction. It is open to the public without charge.

Wilbur (August 26, 1908 ‚Äì September 20, 1992) was an American psychiatrist. She is best known for a book, written by Flora Rheta Schreiber, and a television film, both titled Sybil, which were presented as non-fiction accounts of the psychiatric treatment she rendered to a person diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. Biography Wilbur graduated from the University of Michigan in 1930 and was one of eight women medical college graduates in 1939. She was the first female medical student intern at Kalamazoo State Hospital, where she successfully treated an agoraphobic girl diagnosed with hysteria. Wilbur was a pioneer clinician, as well as an educator, researcher, and mentor for others in the field of psychiatry. Wilbur was one of the authors of Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962),Bieber, Irving, et al. Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals. New York: Basic Books, 1962. an influential study of the development of male homosexuality.Lewes, Kenneth. The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality. New York: Meridian, pp.206-211 Wilbur is best known for her work with Shirley Ardell Mason, who was purported to have been severely abused as a child, and who developed 16 alternate personalities as a result. A book, written by Flora Rheta Schreiber, and a television film, both titled Sybil, were ostensibly non-fiction accounts of the psychiatric treatment received by Mason while in Wilbur's care. She diagnosed and treated Mason for dissociative identity disorder (then referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder) beginning in 1954 and continuing for 11 years. From 1965-1967 she served as the Superintendent at the Weston State Hospital in Weston, West Virginia. Wilbur lectured around the world about child, spouse, and elder abuse and their repercussions, and advocated parenting education to prevent child abuse. She was also interested in increasing the admission rates of women to medical schools. In the late 1970s, Wilbur consulted on the case of Billy Milligan, the first man to be acquitted of a crime in the United States by reason of insanity due to multiple personality disorder. Wilbur was a Diplomate of the American Board of Neurology and Psychiatry in both Neurology and Psychiatry (1946), had a certificate in psychoanalysis (1951), and was Professor Emerita at the University of Kentucky Medical College. She was a Life Fellow of the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. She was honored by the University of Kentucky Medical College for her Outstanding Contribution to Medical Education. In 1987, she was honored for her Distinguished Achievements by the International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociative Disorders. She published about 50 papers in peer-reviewed professional journals. Controversy Wilbur's diagnosis of Mason has been questioned, and both Flora Schreiber and she have been accused of inventing or exaggerating the multiple personality diagnosis and manipulating Mason for professional and financial gain. One examination of the case of \\"Sybil\\" is Debbie Nathan's book Sybil Exposed: The Extraordinary Story Behind the Famous Multiple Personality Case. Nathan presented evidence that Mason never enacted multiple personalities until she met Wilbur. The patient's symptoms emerged over the years from a mutually reinforced self-deception of both Mason and Wilbur. Nathan's research indicated that Wilbur and Schreiber fabricated numbers of narrative in Sybil to bolster their story of Mason, including the false confession of Mason's father that her deceased mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Duck canvas is more tightly woven than plain canvas. There is also linen duck, which is less often used. Cotton duck is used in a wide range of applications, from sneakers to painting canvases to tents to sandbags. Duck fabric is woven with two yarns together in the warp and a single yarn in the weft.  Classification  Close-up showing weave Duck is classified according to weight in a numerical system, with grade 1 the heaviest and grade 12 the lightest variety. Besides this, traditional names exist, which are rarely used today. The classification system used today dates from the 1920s. A numbered duck classification system was put into effect by the Cotton Duck Association and the United States Department of Commerce when discrepancies came about with various specifications and qualities of material. In a technical paper titled \\"Development of the Standard Numbered Cotton Duck Specification\\", the Department's National Bureau of Standards established a set of specifications acceptable to manufacturer and consumer. According to the Department of Commerce, \\"The number of the duck is based on the following computation: Number of Duck = 19 ‚àí (Weight per linear yard 22 inches wide in ounces).\\" A numbering system is used to describe the various weights of duck cloth, based on the weight of a piece. Weights below 19 ounces are called numbered duck. Those above 19 ounces are called naught duck. The grade of numbered duck refers to the number of ounces subtracted from 19 for a 36-by-22-inch piece of fabric. For example, a piece of 8 numbered duck with dimensions of 36 by 22 inches weighs (19 ‚àí 8 = 11). ;Number duck classifications per linear yard, 22 inches wide Numbered duck is nominally made in weights from 1 to 12, but numbers 7, 9, and 11 are no longer used. Some typical uses of various grades (with weights in ounces) are: * 1 (18 oz): hammocks, cots, sandbags * 2 (17 oz): hatch paulins * 3 (16 oz): heavy-duty bags * 4 (15 oz): sea bags * 5 (14 oz): heavy work clothes * 6 (13 oz): large boat covers, heavy work clothes * 8 (11 oz): work clothes, clothes bags * 10 (9 oz): work clothes, shower curtains * 12 (7 oz): light clothes ;Number duck classifications per square yard There is often confusion when it comes to matching up weights and the correct number duck classification.

She is the principal owner and former executive chairman of Investment AB Kinnevik, one of the largest family-controlled companies in Sweden. Early life Stenbeck was born in New York City as the eldest daughter of Jan Stenbeck (1942-2002), a Swedish industrialist and entrepreneur, and her American mother, Merrill McLeod. Her parents had three other children, Hugo, Sophie and Max Stenbeck. Her father also had the son Felix Granander. Stenbeck is the granddaughter of Hugo Stenbeck (1890 ‚Äì 1977), a Swedish industrialist and lawyer who was one of the co-founders of the family company, Investment AB Kinnevik. Stenbeck attended St. Andrew's School in Delaware (where she later served as a trustee), and graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Science in 2000 at age 22. Career Stenbeck's business career began in 1997 after she joined the board of Invik & Co, a finance-based subsidiary of Kinnevik at the time. Stenbeck assumed leadership of the group in 2003 when she became the vice chairman of Investment AB Kinnevik, later becoming chairman in 2007. In 2016 she stepped down as chairman of Kinnevik to concentrate on her role as principal owner focusing on investments, increasingly in the e-commerce sector. For the next decade after 2003, Stenbeck made successful changes at Kinnevik, consolidating the ownership of the group, whilst simplifying the corporate structure. She also divested peripheral businesses in order to reduce leverage and increase transparency of the company. Her leadership has also seen the group's global network expand; the Kinnevik Group now operate in more than 80 countries in the communication, entertainment, media and e-commerce sectors, with well-known brands like Tigo, Tele2, Viasat, and Zalando forming part of the firm's reach. In early 2014, she was appointed chairman of the board at the online fashion retail website Zalando. She also assumed the chairman role at telecoms giant Millicom in May 2014. She has also joined external boards of Spotify and Babylon. Stenbeck is a board member of the Reach for Change foundation which promotes social entrepreneurship and business activities in Africa, Scandinavia, Russia and the CIS. She also works for the Hugo Stenbeck Foundation with her siblings, Sophie and Max, a charitable foundation established by her grandfather in 1962. Honors and awards In April 2012, Stenbeck was awarded the Swedish Royal Patriotic Society Business Medal for outstanding entrepreneurship, while in November 2012, she won the Golden Gavel for her leadership as chairman of a listed company. Personal life Stenbeck has been married to the English businessman Alexander Fitzgibbons since September 2005.

For this reason, Tarporley Church of England Primary School has a pear tree for its emblem. In 1066, the settlement was owned by Wulfgeat of Madeley and was worth one pound. Twenty years later, under the ownership of Gilbert the Hunter, Tarporley‚Äôs value had halved, to ten shillings. At the 2001 Census, the population was 2,634, falling slightly to 2,614 at the 2011 Census. Tarporley civil parish also contains the village of Rhuddall Heath. Since 2009 it forms part of the unitary authority district of Cheshire West and Chester. Tarporley High Street features four pubs: the Foresters Arms, the Swan Hotel, the Crown Hotel, and the Rising Sun. The High Street is also home to three restaurants: Piste, The Coast Restaurant and Bar, and Little Tap.

This ward stretches north-east to the Budworths with a total population at the 2011 Census of 4,398. =Civic history= The Urban District of Tarporley was created in 1894 and was abolished in 1936. From 1936 until 1974 Tarporley was a part of the Rural District of Northwich, until that district's abolition as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. From 1 April 1974 Tarporley formed part of the borough of Vale Royal, within Cheshire and was included in the new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester on 1 April 2009. The village has civil parish status and its own parish council, giving it some limited local government autonomy. The parish council comprises 12 locally elected members. =Political representation= Tarporley has been in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury since that constituency's re- establishment in 1983, following its abolition in 1950. The constituency has been represented by Conservative MPs since its re-establishment: Edward Timpson (since 2019), Stephen O'Brien (1999‚Äì2015) and Antoinette Sandbach (2015‚Äì19). Geography and transport Tarporley is bypassed by the A49 and A51 roads. The village was once served by Beeston Castle and Tarporley railway station on the North Wales Coast Line between Crewe and Chester, more than two miles from the village; the line remains open but the station closed in April 1966. A local bus service, route 84, is provided by Arriva Buses Wales. Swan Hotel, Tarporley Education Tarporley has two schools: Tarporley High School and Tarporley Church of England Primary School. Brook Farm School was a state special education boarding school located in the village that closed in 2001. Demolition at the site commenced in 2013.

This example was prepared as a model, with a partial coal dust coating and the plug left out. It was found in Jefferson Davis' office by Union General Edward Ripley when Union forces captured Richmond in April 1865. The coal torpedo was a hollow iron casting filled with explosives and covered in coal dust, deployed by the Confederate Secret Service during the American Civil War, and intended for doing harm to Union steam transportation. When shoveled into the firebox amongst the coal, the resulting explosion would at the very least damage the boiler and render the engines inoperable. At worst, a catastrophic boiler explosion would kill crewmen and passengers, start a fire, or even sink the vessel. Development Thomas Courtenay in the uniform of a Confederate Army captain. The coal torpedo was invented by Captain Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay of the Confederate Secret Service.Milton F. Perry, Infernal Machines. New Orleans: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, pp. 135‚Äì138.The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Washington, DC, 1888. Series I, Vol. 22 part 2, pg. 970. Available online at Cornell University Library's Making of America collection, link verified October 31, 2006. During the Civil War, the term torpedo was used to indicate a wide range of explosive devices including what are now called land mines, naval mines, improvised explosive devices, and booby traps. Northern newspapers referred to Courtenay's coal bombs as torpedoes, or sometimes \\"infernal machines\\"; Courtenay himself called it his \\"coal shell\\".The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Washington, DC, 1897. Series I, Vol. 26, pp. 184‚Äì187. Available online at Cornell University Library's Making of America collection, link verified October 31, 2006. The torpedoes were manufactured at the 7th Avenue Artillery shop (across the street from Tredegar Iron Works) in Richmond, Virginia, in January 1864.The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Washington, DC, 1897. Series I, Vol. 5, pg. 395. Available online at Cornell University Library's Making of America collection, link verified October 31, 2006. The manufacturing process was similar to that used for artillery shells, except that actual pieces of coal were used as patterns for iron castings. The walls of the coal shell were about 3/8 inch thick, creating a hollow space inside sufficient to hold 3‚Äì4 ounces of gunpowder. After filling, the shell was closed with a threaded plug, then dipped in melted beeswax and rolled in coal dust, creating the appearance of a lump of coal.\\"Coal Torpedoes\\", The Times (London), 30 December 1875, page 4. Finished coal torpedoes were about 4 inches (10 cm) on a side and weighed 3‚Äì4 lb (1.5‚Äì2 kg). The size and powder charge of the coal torpedo was similar to a 6-pound shrapnel shell (a hollow, four-inch cannonball containing gunpowder and 24 musket balls as shrapnel) or the equivalent of three Civil War-era hand grenades. Even so, the explosion of a coal torpedo under a ship's boiler would not by itself be sufficient to sink the vessel. The purpose of the coal torpedo was to burst the pressurized steam boiler, which had the potential to cause a tremendous secondary explosion. Boiler explosions were not uncommon in the early years of steam transportation, and often resulted in the complete destruction of the vessel by fire. In action, the coal torpedo would leave little evidence that a boiler explosion was due to sabotage. Deployment The sidewheeler Greyhound. Courtenay was authorized to form a company of men to infiltrate enemy lines and place coal torpedoes in the coal piles used to fuel Union steam ships.William A. Tidwell, April '65. Kent, Ohio: The Kent State University Press, 1995, pg. 52. It was especially intended to be used against ships of the Union blockade, although Courtenay was authorized to act against any Union military or commercial shipping in Confederate waters.Raimondo Luraghi, A History of the Confederate Navy. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1996, pp. 243-244.The War of the Rebellion. The Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Washington, DC, 1900. Series IV, Vol. 3, pg. 202. Available online at Cornell University Library's Making of America collection, link verified October 31, 2006 Although the Union blockade and other forms of military shipping were Courtenay's primary targets, he also had plans to use the coal torpedo to attack steam locomotives, although no confirmed attacks are known to have been made. On 19 March 1864, a Union gunboat captured a rebel courier crossing the Mississippi, carrying a letter from Courtenay describing the coal torpedo. The correspondence was forwarded to Admiral David Porter, who immediately issued his General Order 184, which began > The enemy have adopted new inventions to destroy human life and vessels in > the shape of torpedoes, and an article resembling coal, which is to be > placed in our coal piles for the purpose of blowing the vessels up, or > injuring them. Officers will have to be careful in overlooking coal barges. > Guards will be placed over them at all times, and anyone found attempting to > place any of these things amongst the coal will be shot on the spot. In April 1865, most of the official papers of the Confederate Secret Service were burned by Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin just before the government evacuated Richmond, making it impossible to determine with any certainty how many ships were destroyed by Courtenay's shell. Union Admiral Porter credited the coal torpedo with sinking the Greyhound, a private steamboat that had been commandeered by General Benjamin F. Butler for use as a floating headquarters on the James River.David D. Porter, \\"Torpedo Warfare.\\" The North American Review, Vol. 127, No. 264, 1878, pp. 225‚Äì227. Available online at Cornell University Library's Making of America collection, link verified October 31, 2006. Courtenay also took credit for the boiler explosion on the gunboat USS Chenango that scalded 33 men (28 fatally), though the vessel itself survived and was repaired and returned to duty.Thatcher, Joseph M, \\"The Courtenay Coal Torpedo,\\" in Military Collector and Historian, Vol. XI, Spring 1959. In the Spring of 1865, Canadian customs raided a house in Toronto that had been rented by Jacob Thompson, one of the commissioners of the Confederate Secret Service stationed in Canada. They found coal torpedoes and other incendiary devices hidden under the floorboards.Adam Mayers, \\"Spies across the border,\\" in Civil War Times Illustrated. June 2001, pg. 31. On April 27, 1865, the sidewheel steamboat Sultana exploded her boilers just above Memphis, TN while carrying almost 2,000 Union prisoners of war home to the North. 1,196 people died. Within a few days, the first mate, who had failed to redistribute the weight on the top-heavy boat once a large load of supplies was removed from the hold, claimed that the Sultana was exploded by a coal torpedo. Three investigative bodies looked into the possibility and refuted it. In 1888, a former Union prison guard claimed that a Confederate mail-carrier named Robert Louden had told him years before that he had used a coal torpedo to sink the steamboat. The mail carrier was long dead and unable to answer questions. Many Sultana survivors and other experts immediately refuted the idea. Captain Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay never claimed the sinking of the Sultana by a coal torpedo. Although the coal torpedo sabotage theory remains popular, it is refuted by most experts, including the historians on History Channel's History Detectives. G.E. and Deb Rule, \\"The Sultana: A case for sabotage,\\" in North and South Magazine, Vol. 5, issue 1, December 2001. After the Civil War Courtenay had traveled to England in 1864 and remained there until 1867, trying to sell the \\"secret\\" of the coal torpedo to foreign governments. He approached the British War Office, but they turned him down after he would not agree to allow them to examine his invention before purchasing it. When Courtenay returned to the United States, one or more business partners to whom he had entrusted the secret remained in England. The Times in 1873 reported rumors that disreputable ship owners were purchasing coal torpedoes to put in their own ships as a form of insurance fraud, so that over-insured ships and cargo would sink while far out at sea, leaving no evidence.\\"Infernal Machines,\\" The Times (London), 13 June 1873.\\"Sayings and doings at home and abroad,\\" Appleton's Journal. Vol. 10, No. 226, 19 July 1873, pg. 95. Other reports scoffed at the rumors, suggesting they were false stories planted by supporters of Samuel Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament who was trying to pass a bill reforming the shipping industry.\\"An infernal engine,\\" The Times (London), 9 June 1873. Nothing was ever proven, but the reports stirred up popular interest in various supposed methods of sabotaging ships, and the coal torpedo even made an appearance in the short story, \\"That Little Square Box,\\" by Arthur Conan Doyle, published in the collection The Captain of the Polestar and Other Tales in 1890. Various forms of exploding coal, whether directly descended from Courtenay's original idea or independently developed, have surfaced multiple times throughout history. The Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization operating in the United States in the late 1860s‚Äì1870s, reportedly considered placing coal torpedoes in the furnaces of New York City hotels as well as English transatlantic steamships.Foreign Office archives from the Public Records Office, London. Volume F.O. 5, 1777, March to May 1881. Letters from Clipperton, British Consul in Philadelphia, to the Foreign Office. They were a strong suspect in the destruction of the warship at Punta Arenas in 1881, but later evidence proved the explosion was accidental. Both the American OSS and the British SOE used forms of exploding coal in World War II.H. Keith Melton. The Ultimate Spy Book. New York:DK Publishing, 1996, pg. 97.; The German commandos who came ashore on Long Island in 1943 as part of Operation Pastorius carried plastic explosives disguised as coal for use against coal-fired electric generating plants.Joel Samaha, Sam Root, and Paul Sexton, eds.

Such a German coal torpedo was given to the British double agent Eddie Chapman (also known as \\"Agent Zig-Zag\\") to sabotage the merchant ship City of Lancaster, but he passed it on to his MI5 handler instead. Similar devices were also made by the Japanese during World War II.

As of 2014, the organization included more than 52,000 national and international members and has more than 100 full-time employees. History Anesthesiology's roots date back to the mid-19th century. On March 30, 1842, Crawford Long, M.D. administered the first ether anesthetic for surgery and operated to remove a tumor from a patient's neck. After the surgery, the patient revealed that he felt nothing and was not aware the surgery was over until he awoke. This was the start of a specialty critical to modern medicine, anesthesiology. In 1905, nine physicians (from Long Island, N.Y.) organized the first professional anesthesia society. In 1911, the Society expanded to 23 members and became the New York Society of Anesthetists. Over the next 25 years, involvement in anesthesia-related issues grew and attracted other interested physicians nationwide. In 1936, the Society changed its name to the American Society of Anesthetists. In 1945, the organization moved to become the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). In 1960, the ASA established an Executive Office in Park Ridge, Illinois to meet growing membership and patient-care demands. In 2014, the ASA opened new headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois. Membership Membership is open to holders of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degrees who are licensed practitioners and have successfully completed a training program in anesthesiology approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The ASA also maintains an active resident component, medical student component as well as an anesthesiologist assistant component. Non-physician providers of anesthesia care (nurse anesthetists, dentist, veterinarians, APRNs) can join as educational members. Governance ASA is governed by its House of Delegates. The House of Delegates is composed of ASA delegates and directors (designated by geographic distribution), ASA officers, all past presidents, the Editor-in- Chief of the journal, the chairs of all sections, the chair of the ASA delegation to the American Medical Association House of Delegates and each member of the Resident Component Governing Council not to exceed five members and a non-voting member of the Medical Student component. The House of Delegates meets each year during the Society's Annual Meeting.  Meetings  Meetings are held annually and are based on scientific progress in the anesthesiology fields.

History The paper was founded in 1952 by Kamel Mrowa, the publisher of the Arabic daily Al-Hayat, to serve the growing number of expatriates brought by the oil industry. First circulating in Lebanon, and then expanding throughout the region, it not only relayed news about foreign workers' home countries, but also served to keep them informed about the region. By the 1960s it was the leading English language newspaper in the Middle East. Upon the death of Mrowa in 1966, his widow Salma El Bissar took over the paper, running it until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War forced the suspension of publication. With peace hopes running high in the beginning of 1983, the paper restarted production under the guidance of Mrowa's sons, but the intensification of the war again put the paper under pressure. The flight of the intelligentsia from the country depleted the paper's staff and its readership. Still, it continued as a daily until mid 1985 and then as a weekly for another year, before ceasing publication once again. One of daily's early editors was Jihad Khazen. With the arrival of peace in 1991, and the development of a rebuilding program three years later, the paper again looked to publish. With Kamel's first son Jamil Mroue as leader, printing was recommenced in 1996 with modern presses, experienced foreign journalists, and an energetic Lebanese staff. In 2004, The Daily Star merged its Lebanon and regional editions choosing to focus on Lebanese expatriates in the Persian Gulf region. Now, the unified edition appears in all countries except for Kuwait which has its own local edition published in partnership with Al-Watan, a Kuwaiti Arabic language daily. In 2006, the newspaper announced that its paper would soon be available in print in the United States. For two weeks (14 January to 31 January 2009), the printing of the paper was suspended by a Lebanese court order after financial difficulties. The website was not updated either. The newspaper resumed publishing the second week of February 2009 with certain agreements with creditors about payment of accumulating debt. Although the website Industry Arabic named the Daily Star as the third most influential Arabic newspaper in 2020, on 4 February 2020, the newspaper announced temporary suspension of its print publication owing to financial difficulties. Distribution and circulation The Daily Star signed an exclusive marketing representation, printing and distribution agreement with the International Herald Tribune in 2000. Under the terms of the agreement, The Daily Star represented the IHT in the GCC, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq. The Daily Star also produced a local edition in Kuwait. Under this agreement, The Daily Star was published and distributed alongside the International Herald Tribunes Middle-East edition. The Daily Star management however decided to break the agreement over a dispute regarding the newspaper's length, which the IHT management wanted to see reduced. The paper considerably reduced in size after temporarily closing in January 2009. It is no longer distributed with the IHT. The Daily Star still has a large online readership mainly from Lebanon, the United States, Canada, European Union, and Australia. In 2009, its website registered more than 80,000 unique visitors per day. The 2011 circulation of the paper was 29,940 copies. Articles by Jamal Khashoggi Jamal Khashoggi has been a contributor as a Saudi political analyst and deputy editor of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs English-language Arab News and has written several commentaries for The Daily Star. His opinions since 2002 included endorsing moderation and combating extremism in Western nations, referring to bin Laden as a moderate who was a victim converted to \\"extreme jihad,\\" applying Geneva Convention articles in Gaza and the West Bank, and expressing skepticism of US-Israeli-Saudi relations, especially after the 1991 Gulf War honeymoon period, in view of demolition of Palestinian homes supported by Colin Powell and the Israeli government, and the lucrative target for potential seizure presented by Saudi Arabia's one-fourth of world's proven oil reserves. One of the four 9/11 widows - known as the \\"Jersey Girls\\" - mentions the unusual timing of the disappearance of Khashoggi with respect to the release of documents by the Department of Justice, supporting the 9/11 Families' Litigation, that may implicate the Saudi government in the 9/11 attacks.

If done properly, the trout will go into a trance after a minute or so, and can then easily be thrown onto the nearest bit of dry land.Brian Morgan. Story of the Virgin Soldier (Trout Tickling): Part of the BBC's WWII People's War Series. 12 May 2005. Article ID A4057706. Accessed on: 16-1-07.  History  Trout tickling has been practiced for many centuries. It is mentioned in Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night, where it is used as a metaphor for bamboozlement by Olivia's servant Maria, who is about to play a vengeful prank on the pompous steward, Malvolio: The technique was a common practice used by boys, poachers and working men in times of economic stress, particularly during the 1930s Depression era.1941 U.S. Parks and Wildlife Service article Poachers using the method required no nets, rods or lines or any other incriminating equipment if apprehended by the police or gamekeepers. Thomas Martindale's 1901 book, Sport, Indeed, describes the method used on trout in the River Wear in County Durham: In Scotland the technique is more often called \\"guddling\\" or sometimes \\"ginniling\\". The practice is currently illegal under most circumstances in Britain.See for example: Introduction to the Regional Rod Fishing Byelaws Environment Agency. Retrieved 19 October 2012. A related method of catching catfish by hand is called noodling in the U.S.A. In history and fiction Trout tickling has an ancient history. The Greek writer Oppian writing in his Halieutica, the greatest work of antiquity on angling, refers to catching trout by hand in the following lines: Aelian, a Greek writer of about 230 A.D., writes in his De Natura Animalium (as published in England in 1565): \\"If men wade into the sea, when the water is low, end stroking the fish nestling in the pools, suddenly lay hands upon and secure them.\\" While in Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife, a ribald comedy dating from 1624, Estifania remarks \\"Here comes another trout that I must tickle, / And tickle daintily\\". The technique is also mentioned in several of Shakespeare's plays: in Twelfth Night, the servant Maria refers to the approach of the hated Malvolio, head of Olivia's household, with the words \\"for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling\\" (Act 2, Scene 5). Maria and others are conspiring to trap Malvolio into acting foolishly by forging a love letter from Olivia. Trout tickling is also mentioned in later works: Mark Twain wrote about catching catfish in a similar manner while mentioning that salmon and certain other species can also be lured and caught in this way. Arthur Ransome's novel The Picts and the Martyrs contains a detailed description of the technique by a young boy from the English Lake District. It is also described as a poaching method in Roald Dahl's classic novel Danny, the Champion of the World, in Linda Buckley- Archer's science fiction novel Gideon the Cutpurse, in Robert A. Heinlein's fantasy novel Glory Road, and in the video game Theme Hospital as a hobby of many of the staff for hire. Terry Pratchett's 2003 young adult novel The Wee Free Men opens with young Tiffany Aching amusing herself by tickling trout. An interview conducted by CSV/BBC NI's Brian Morgan, Story of the Virgin Soldier, for the BBC Peoples War project, reports how one soldier, Robert McIlroy, impressed his senior commanders by 'tickling trout' out of the river in order for fellow soldiers to eat. In the book The White Mountains by John Christopher, one of the party members (Henry) attempts to tickle trout unsuccessfully in an attempt to forage food for the group. In an episode of The Waltons (\\"The Search\\", S. 4, E.15), Olivia, Jim Bob, and Elizabeth set out to visit a friend but become lost on Walton's Mountain, and while lost Jim Bob catches fish using this method which he had learned from Grandpa.

Biography Carli was born in San Severo, Apulia, to Florentine father and Apulian mother. He spent his formative years in Florence, where he met Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in the 1910s, and adhered to Futurism as a member of the so-called pattuglia azzurra (\\"Azure platoon\\"). After fighting in World War I, he engaged in favor of the Arditi, and reached Gabriele D'Annunzio during the latter's political experiment in occupied Fiume in 1919. Carli then supported the militant anti- fascist Arditi del Popolo, created in 1920. A successful journalist, Carli adhered to Benito Mussolini's Fascist movement the moment it started; he and his friend Emilio Settimelli published the intimidating newspaper L‚ÄôImpero. Nonetheless, he proved to be a dissident, and joined the field of those considered \\"left-wing fascists\\". In the 1930s, Carli was Italy's consul general in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Tormented by illness, he died prematurely in Rome. Works Carli wrote extensively, producing works like the experimental novel Retroscena (\\"Background\\"; 1915), and the memoir Con d‚ÄôAnnunzio a Fiume (\\"With D‚ÄôAnnunzio in Fiume\\"; 1920). In 1923 he published La mia divinit√† (\\"My Divinity\\"), a text in which he gathered his poetry, small poems in prose among which stands out Notti filtrate (\\"Filtered Nights\\") - a pre-Surrealist piece of importance. The writings express Carli's conviction in life as energy, an egoistical effort at realising oneself against all odds and perils.

Founded in 1998, USSSP is organized as a non-profit corporation and is maintained by volunteer Scouters. While the Project supports the programs of the Boy Scouts of America and the World Organization of the Scout Movement, neither organization contributes financially or provides direction to the organization. Background The USSSP was the idea of Chris Marsey who brought together one of the largest repositories of Scouting Clip-Art to the world Scouting community in 1996. Soon thereafter, Dave Tracewell and Gary Hendra added their large electronic clip-art collections to the collection. The USSSP continued to grow, adding Scouters from around the country with specialized talents who contributed many hours of time and resources to the project. As of 2010, most of the board members were Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts in their youth and have obtained their programs' highest youth honors. All of the board members have served at the local Council level as unit leaders, commissioners and committee chairs and collectively have more than 400 years of service. Many of the board members have served as part of a summer camp staff for two or more summers; three have taught courses at the Philmont Training Center. Two of the board members serve local Councils as Professional Scouters; another board member served for several years as a Paraprofessional Executive. Board members are Wood Badge trained and many have been honored with the BSA's Silver Beaver Award for distinguished service to one or several local Councils.

The program ran after the network's late-night program Saturday Night Live (hence the title playing off from the program) at 1 am, and was a cult favorite. Stella The program was hosted by Stella, dubbed \\"the man-eater from Manayunk\\" (a section near the Schuylkill River, a working- class neighborhood) or the \\"Daughter of Desire,\\" Stella delighted in half-clad gorgeous young men and often had one or two hanging in her dungeon awaiting her pleasure. According to her biography, Stella was \\"born in North Libido, New Jersey, a small village outside of Atlantic City. She is the only child of traveling hecklers. Her parents dropped her in a plastic basket at Fifth and Shunk in front of Guido's Hair Weaving and Plumbing Supplies, but for all intents and purposes she was raised by a flock of pigeons\\". Reincarnated 37 times, Stella was just your typical \\"ghoul\\" next door. In real life, she was Karen Scioli, a South Philadelphia born actress, writer, and homemaker who weekly donned a push-up bra, slinky black dress, feather boa, false eyelashes and a mole on her right cheek. As clarified by Scioli in the 2006 documentary film American Scary, Stella was not a vampiress or monster, she was instead a traditional, non-supernatural vamp. In 2012, Scioli/\\"Stella\\" was inducted into the Horror Host Hall of Fame. Other regulars on the program were Stella's canopied-bed called \\"Beda Lugosi\\" which talked and vibrated; Skeeves the Butler (Bill Brown) who left the show and was replaced by Hives the Butler (Bob Billbrough); Cousin Mel (Glenn Davish), who was nerdy and was told by everyone (in a tribute to a character on The Dick Van Dyke Show played by Richard Deacon) to \\"Shut up, Mel.\\" Davish (who was in the movie Mannequin with Andrew McCarthy, Kim Cattrall and Estelle Getty) also played a whacked out mad scientist named Dr. Schuylkill (a play off the Schuylkill River and the Schuylkill Expressway) and voiced a faceless dungeon monster named Iggy who ate anybody that Stella didn't like, as well as a talking portrait (named \\"Portrait\\") that gave sarcastic responses to whatever Stella was wise-cracking about. Two other actresses - Donna Ryan, who played the whacked out psychic \\"Madame Tofutti\\" and Kathy Robinson - were regulars on the show.

The unit traces its lineage to the 312th Bombardment Squadron (Light) constituted in 1942. It presents realistic adversary threats to US and allied military forces to improve their training for space-associated operations. It is stationed at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. Its present form dates from its activation as part of the United States Air Force in 2000. That year it was activated as part of the Space Warfare Centre, but it was then transferred to the 57th Adversary Tactics Group in 2006. With the formation of the Space Force in 2019, the squadron was part of the second wave of transfers and reorganizations which took place in mid-2020. Mission Its mission is to train US, joint and allied military forces for combat with space-capable adversaries; preparing USAF, Joint and Allied Forces for combat through realistic threat replication, training, and feedback through specialized and certified space-capable aggressors. It operates adversary space systems, develops new tactics, techniques and procedures to counter threats, and improves the US military space posture. The squadron attempts to replicate enemy threats to space-based and space-enabled systems during tests and training exercises. By using Global Positioning System and satellite communications jamming techniques, it provides Air Force, joint and coalition military personnel with an understanding of how to recognize, mitigate, counter and defeat these threats. The 527th serves to know, teach and replicate a wide array of terrestrial and space threats to the U.S. Department of Defense's space enablers. The squadron trains the modern warfighter to operate in an environment where critical systems like GPS and SATCOM are interfered with or denied‚Äîpreparing them for the current and future fights, and guaranteeing U.S. battlefield dominance well into the 21st century. History =World War II= Initially activated as the 312th Bombardment Squadron, a Douglas A-20 Havoc light bomber squadron in the southeast, trained under Third Air Force. Was reequipped as a Douglas A-24 Banshee fighter-bomber squadron and redesignated as the 527th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in August 1943. Was deployed to Twelfth Air Force in North Africa in May 1943, being initially stationed in Algeria. Flying operations began 15 May from M√©diouna Airfield, near Casablanca, French Morocco. Moved eastward supporting the Fifth Army with close air support missions. In the North African Campaign, the squadron engaged German positions in Tunisia. In July, initial elements of the squadron moved to Sicily. From the Gela Airfield, begin flying combat missions, supporting the 1st Division of II Army Corps. On 27 August, the squadron provided air support for the first Allied landings on the European mainland at Salerno, Italy. On 10 September, three days after the invasion of Salerno, advance echelons of the squadron moved to Sele Airfield, near the beachhead. Enemy shelling of the beaches caused considerable difficulty during the move, and the 5527th did not fly its first missions until 15 September. Moved north through Italy during the Italian Campaign, supported Allied forces by attacking enemy lines of communication, troop concentrations and supply areas. In April 1944 the squadron attacked the German Gustav Line. It also attacked rail and road targets and strafed German troop and supply columns during late spring. The 527th was an active participant in Operation Strangle, the attempt to cut German supply lines prior to the Allied offensive aimed at rail and road networks, and attacking German troop and supply columns. While Strangle did not significantly cut into German supplies, it did disrupt enemy tactical mobility and was a major factor in the Allies‚Äô eventual breakthrough. During this period the 527th received Curtiss P-40 Warhawks to augment its aging A-36s, but the obsolescent P-40s were only a stopgap measure. The 527th welcomed its first Republic P-47 Thunderbolts a few weeks later, on 23 June. Moved to Corsica in July 1944. From Poretta Airfield, the squadron flew bombing missions against coastal defenses in direct support of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France 15 Aug. 1944. Allied forces met little resistance as they moved inland twenty miles in the first twenty- four hours. Once the invasion was completed, the squadron moved back to northern Italy and continued its coastal basing by attacking enemy road and rail networks in northern Italy and, for the first time, flying regular escort missions with heavy bombers. The 527th also conducted armed reconnaissance against the enemy in the Po Valley region. The 527th continued combat in northern Italy until February 1945, when it left the Mediterranean Theater and moved to Tantonville Airfield, France, in the Lorraine region, and operations shifted from targets in the Po Valley to those in southern Germany. The 527th's first mission to Germany ‚Äì a cause of some excitement ‚Äì was on 25 Feb. 1945, and by March most missions were flown into Germany against rail lines, roads, supply dumps, enemy installations and airfields. The squadron transferred from Tantonville to Braunshardt Airfield, near Darmstadt, Germany, The 527th Fighter Squadron flew its final combat mission on 8 May 1945. Just after the war, the squadron performed military occupation duty in Germany, with personnel demobilizing throughout the summer. The squadron's last personnel were sent back to the United States from AAF Station Schweinfurt, Germany, on 15 February 1946, with the squadron inactivated as an administrative unit in March. =Cold War= F-86Fs of the 527th Fighter- Bomber Squadron - 86th FBW - Landstuhl AB, West Germany The squadron was reactivated in the postwar era 20 August 1946 at AAF Station Nordholz, Germany equipped with surplus P-47 Thunderbolts from storage depots in Europe. Over the next several years, the squadron underwent several redesignations and several station assignments in occupied Germany. In June 1948, the squadron was moved to Neubiberg Air Base, near Munich when tensions with the Soviet Union culminated in the Berlin Blockade. By 1948, it was obvious that the piston-engine Thunderbolts would be no match for Soviet jet fighters, and in early 1950 the squadron was re-equipped with Republic F-84E Thunderjets for air defense of the Munich area. With the arrival of the jet age in Europe, USAFE wanted to move its units west of the Rhine River, as its bases in the Munich area were just a few minutes flying time from Soviet Mig-15 bases in Czechoslovakia. The squadron relocated to a new base, located west of the Rhine River near Kaiserslautern, West Germany in 1952. Landstuhl Air Base opened for operations on 5 August 1952, and the 527th Fighter Bomber Squadron arrived on 21 August. In April 1953, the 527th completed its move to Landstuhl and was soon reequipped with the North American F-86F Sabre Jet, the first unit in USAFE to fly the most modern American fighter. The F-86F had been very successful as both a fighter and fighter bomber in the Korean War, and marked a quantum increase in the Wing‚Äôs capabilities. A year later the squadron was redesignated the 527th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and assumed a new mission of air defense for the central European region. For this mission, the squadron was re-equipped with the rocket-armed North American F-86D Sabre interceptor which provided an all-weather capability The 527th was inactivated on 8 Feb 1956 in a reorganization of air defense forces in West Germany by USAFE, with personnel and equipment transferring to the 461st Fighter-Day Squadron. = Fighter Aggressor Squadron= 527th Agressor Squadron F-16C Fighting FalconAircraft is General Dynamics F-16C Block 30A Fighting Falcon, serial 85-1479 at RAF Bentwaters, England in 1988. This was the first European based aggressor aircraft and it is shown parked in front of a hardened aircraft shelter adorned with a Russian bear and star. The 527th was the only USAFE squadron in the United Kingdom to be assigned the F-16. In April 1976, the squadron was reactivated at RAF Alconbury, England as the 527th Tactical Fighter Training and Aggressor Squadron, becoming the United States Air Forces in Europe's only aggressor squadron. The 527th began providing aggressor support to European-based combat units in September. Its mission was to train United States Air Forces Europe fighter pilots for air combat with Eastern bloc adversaries using \\"Dissimilar Air Combat Training\\" (DACT) The squadron was equipped with the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, being originally part of an order of aircraft destined for South Vietnam. The first batch of eight aircraft were air-freighted into Alconbury on 21 May 1976 on board a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy direct from the production facility at Palmdale, California. Eight more Tigers arrived on 14 June with the final batch of four following ten days later, on 24 June. These aircraft were also airfreighted on board a C-5A. The 527th was fully operational a few months later with the first DACT course commencing in October 1976 The aggressor F-5Es were painted in a variety of colourful camouflage schemes designed to mimic those in use by Warsaw Pact aircraft. Two-digit Soviet-style nose codes were applied to most aggressor aircraft. These coincided with the last two digits of the serial number. When there was duplication, three digits were used. International conventions made it necessary for military aircraft to carry their national insignia, but the star-and-bar national insignia was reduced in size and relocated to a less- conspicuous position on the rear fuselage. The 527th's Aggressor aircraft were among the first to apply the star and bar in toned-down or stencil form, now standard on USAF aircraft. The 527th Aggressors flew their aircraft in intense turns and other maneuvers as their mission involved intense combat fighter training, often involving high-G turns at supersonic speeds. The Aggressors trained both United States Air Force squadrons in Soviet fighter tactics, but deployed frequently to other NATO airfields, training pilots from Norway to Greece and Turkey, France, West Germany and the Low Countries in combat tactics. After 12 years of intense flying, in 1988 the fleet of aggressor F-5Es were getting rather worn out as a result of sustained exposure to the rigours of air combat manoeuvring. There were restrictions placed on operations in which pilots were warned not to exceed a certain G-load. Some repair kits had to be devised to overcome these problems, and the estimated cost of repair of the entire fleet was beginning to exceed a billion dollars. In addition, with the appearance of a new generation of Soviet fighters, it became apparent that F-5Es could no longer adequately mimic Warsaw Pact threats. It was decided to re-equip the squadron with General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcons and move the squadron to RAF Bentwaters. In return, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II's at Bentwaters would move to Alconbury and give the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing a new close air support mission. After the 527th was reassigned, eight of the lowest-hour F-5E's were transferred to the Navy for Top Gun/Aggressor training at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California in July 1988. The remainder were sent to storage at RAF Kemble for refurbishing. From there they were sold under the foreign military assistance program to Morocco and Tunisia in October 1989. One F-5E was thought to be retained at Alconbury for static display as a gate guard. In reality this is a plastic/fiberglass model with an authentic windscreen and canopy. The 527th flew its last F-5E sortie from Alconbury on 22 June 1988 and personnel and equipment was moved to RAF Bentwaters. The first two of an intended complement of eighteen F-16Cs arrived at Bentwaters on 14 June 1988. These were single examples taken from the 52d Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ramstein Air Base. The first four months at Bentwaters were dedicated to pilot conversion for the new aircraft. The 527th AS resumed their aggressor role in November 1988 when six McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagles from the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base, Germany arrived at Bentwaters for the start of a three-week DACT course. The 527th's complement of aircraft had reached twelve on 16 January 1989 when one more F-16C was delivered from Spangdahlem. In 1989 with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and a reduction of defense spending, the decision was made to terminate the entire USAF aggressor program. In November 1989 the squadron began disposing of its F-16Cs in preparation for inactivation the following year. The first two aircraft to leave were flown to Spangdahlem on 29 November 1989. The 527th had reassigned its entire fleet of 12 aircraft by mid-1990 and was inactivated on 30 September 1990. It was to be the only F-16 unit ever to be based in the United Kingdom. =Space Aggressor Squadron= The 527th was not activated again until 29 September 2000 when it became the 527th Space Aggressor Squadron.

The School of Law is nationally recognized for its public interest law and cooperative legal education programs.http://www.northeastern.edu/law/about/quickfacts.html History Northeastern University School of Law was founded by YMCA of Greater Boston in 1898 as the first evening law program in the city. The program was incorporated as an LL.B.-granting law school, the Evening School of Law of Boston YMCA, in 1904. Additional campuses of YMCA Law School were opened in Worcester, Massachusetts by 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts by 1919, and Providence, Rhode Island by 1921. The Worcester and Providence branches were closed by 1942, but the Springfield branch eventually became the Western New England University School of Law. In its early days, the school \\"saw itself as the working man's alternative to the elite schools\\" and \\"boasted of being 'An Evening Law School with Day School Standards,'\\" using the case method of teaching, according to legal historian Robert Stevens. The school was renamed Northeastern University School of Law in 1922 and began admitting women that year. NUSL was accredited by the University of the State of New York in 1943 and became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1945. It was accredited by the American Bar Association in 1969.  Notable features  The School of Law is named as one of the top public interest law schools in the nation. All students are required to complete a public interest co-op, and many students participate in the school's clinics and institutes, such as the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project. In addition, all students are required to complete a year-long social justice project during their first year. Northeastern is #1 for \\"Practical Training,\\" according to The National Jurist. The Princeton Review's \\"The Best 172 Law Schools\\" ranks Northeastern #2 among all the law schools for both providing the \\"best environment\\" for minority students and for having the \\"most liberal\\" students.

Also known as transconveyance amplifiers, CTAs amplify electronic signals by dynamically conveying charge between capacitive nodes in proportion to the size of a differential input voltage. By appropriately selecting the relative node capacitances, voltage amplification occurs by the charge-voltage relationship of capacitors. CTAs are clocked, or sampling, amplifiers. They consume zero static power and can be designed to consume (theoretically) arbitrarily low dynamic power, proportional to the size of input signals being sampled. CMOS technology is most commonly used for implementation. CTAs were introduced in memory circuits in the 1970s, and more recently have been applied in multi-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute is a nonprofit cancer treatment and research center located in Tampa, Florida. Established in 1981 by the Florida Legislature, the hospital opened in October 1986, on the University of South Florida campus. Moffitt is the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center based in Florida. In 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranked Moffitt Cancer Center as the No. 11 cancer hospital in the nation. History Funding for construction of the initial $70 million facility came primarily from the state of Florida's cigarette tax, while the momentum to create the center came from a cadre of legislators, physicians, educators, and business leaders who envisioned a new dimension of cancer care and research in Florida. In late 1978, H. Lee Moffitt, a Florida state representative, recognized the need for a comprehensive cancer center within the state after several friends died from cancer. An excellent negotiator, Moffitt put his plan into motion by first proposing the idea to Hollis Boren, then dean of the University of South Florida College of Medicine. Over lunch at the Tampa Club, Moffitt proposed his idea. By dessert, Boren has signed on. \\"Out of that discussion came plans for a plug-shaped, multilevel cancer research teaching hospital to be built a short walk away from the USF clinics,\\" The Tampa Times reported on February 5, 1979. Moffitt and Boren had gathered information about the need for a comprehensive cancer center, the article said, and the need was great. Moffitt sought community support and convinced the State Legislature to fund the facility. During the center's planning phase, consultants associated with NCI-designated Cancer Centers were retained to ensure that the finished facility would be as technologically advanced and as efficiently designed as possible. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place in January 1983. The center was incorporated in the spring of 1984 and was named for H. Lee Moffitt, then Speaker of the State House of Representatives. The building was dedicated in October 1986 and admitted its first patients that same month. In 1990, the acquisition of the Research Center building across from the Cancer Center enhanced the recruitment of scientists, clinicians, and support staff, and expanded Moffitt's vision beyond the original structure. The Moffitt Research Center became the focal point for basic and translational cancer research with the overriding goal to produce discoveries that could be translated quickly from the bench to the patient's bedside. The Florida Legislature allocated $12 million for renovation and equipment for this structure, and the Moffitt Research Center became fully operational in 1995. In 1999, of basic research lab space was added to the Moffitt Research Center at a cost of $11 million to house the growing need for additional scientists. Organization On June 10, 1998, in a ceremonial signing at Moffitt, Florida governor Lawton Chiles approved a legislative initiative to fund construction of the Moffitt Tower Project, which opened in April 2003, adding more than of new space. This expansion includes the Vincent A. Stabile Research Building, eponymously named in recognition of the largest private donation ever made to the Cancer Center. The new construction also includes an expansion of the Moffitt Clinic. In addition to new research laboratories, which nearly double the cancer center's research capabilities, the new facilities include a digital imaging center, and a new infusion center. In 1991, John Ruckdeschel, assumed the position of center director, president and CEO. Under Ruckdeschel's leadership, Moffitt became a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Center. In 2017, the NCI renewed Moffitt's Cancer Center Support Grant for another five years. Currently Moffitt receives more than $50 million annually in peer-reviewed grant monies. In 2002, Ruckdeschel stepped down, and William Dalton, became Moffitt's third president, CEO and center director. In 2008, the University of Florida and Shands at UF formed a partnership with Moffitt to develop programs in cancer care, research and prevention. In 2009, the University of South Florida and Moffitt were awarded $6 million in federal grant money to create the Center for Equal Health, a five-year partnership focused on addressing issues of cancer health disparities.USF, Moffitt get grant for minority health center Scientific programs include molecular oncology;, drug discovery; immunology; experimental therapeutics; computational biology of cancer; health outcomes; and behavior and risk assessment, detection and intervention. It also serves as the site for the Bill and Beverly Young National Functional Genomics Center, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Moffitt Cancer Center is affiliated with the University of South Florida College of Medicine, and provides education to medical students and residency training as well. On June 24, 2011, Moffitt Cancer Center opened the first blood and marrow transplant (BMT) clinic in Puerto Rico. On July 1, 2011, Moffitt Cancer Center opened a new 50,000-square-foot satellite facility at International Plaza. The building replaced Moffitt's former outpatient center at Tampa General Hospital. In July 2012, William Dalton, became the CEO of M2Gen and Moffitt's new Personalized Medicine Institute. Alan List, who previously served as Moffitt's executive vice president/physician-in-chief and president of the Moffitt Medical Group, succeeded Dalton as CEO and president. Thomas Sellers assumed the role of center director. In February 2013, Moffitt began construction of a $74.2 million outpatient facility on the cancer center's 30-acre property on N McKinley Drive, about a mile from Moffitt's main campus. In November 2015, Moffitt opens the McKinley Outpatient Center. The six-story, 207,000-square-foot facility at 10920 N McKinley Drive is located about a mile from the main campus. Services on the site include the skin and breast cancer clinics, four operating rooms, an imaging suite, research labs, space for blood draws and a Publix pharmacy.Small touches for patients are the pride of Moffitt's new outpatient center In July 2017, Moffitt and Memorial Healthcare announce a partnership to establish a comprehensive blood and marrow transplant cellular therapy program for South Florida residents. The alliance brings the renowned cancer center's access to research, clinical trials, and comprehensive treatment to leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients. Research and Treatment Through clinical trials, Jeffrey Weber, director of the Donald A. Adam Comprehensive Melanoma Research Center at Moffitt, and researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center discovered two monotherapy drugs ‚Äì Mekinist (trametinib) and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) ‚Äì can be safely combined to overcome or delay treatment resistance for a large percentage of melanoma patients with a specific gene mutation. Approved by the FDA in January 2014, Mekinist in combination with Tafinlar is one of the biggest advancements in melanoma treatment in the past 30 years. In August 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug vemurafenib (Zelboraf) for metastatic melanoma patients who test positive for a specific gene mutation. Moffitt Cancer Center conducted a registration trial using the drug manufactured by Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Anna Giuliano, director of Moffitt's Center for Infection Research in Cancer, led two studies on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in men. Her work strengthened the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation for boys and men to receive HPV vaccinations and provided useful data for the development of realistic cost- effectiveness models for male HPV vaccination internationally. In September 2014, a new cancer immunotherapy for melanoma patients called Keytruda became the first anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy approved in the United States. Jeffrey Weber, director of the Donald A. Adam Comprehensive Melanoma Research Center of Excellence at Moffitt, was one of the lead investigators of the clinical trial which led to the drug receiving breakthrough status from the FDA. In January 2016, researchers at Moffitt teamed up with the state of Florida in a study to see if making fruits and vegetables available to children who otherwise may not have them readily available can decrease their risk of cancer. In October 2017, the Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of Yescarta‚Ñ¢, a revolutionary new immunotherapy for adult patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Yescarta is a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, also known as CAR-T. Moffitt Cancer Center's Frederick Locke, is the co-lead investigator of the pivotal ZUMA-1 clinical trial that tested the new therapy, which is manufactured by Kite, a Gilead company.

Harper and Row, 1973. Degrees were granted after students demonstrated competence in their fields to a faculty committee. In 1975, a group of students from the University of Pittsburgh Alternative Curriculum program toured several New England schools that were offering new and progressive programs, including Franconia College. Several students were invited to come back for a special summer session that included classes for \\"Sugar Maple Woodlot Management\\" and \\"Auto Mechanics\\". Teachers with local professional experience offered hands-on education and experience with tools of the trade and actual work experience, such as the basics of auto tune-ups, as well as learning how to evaluate a woodlot for the healthiest growth of the trees. Students learned how to safely work on cars and use a chain saw to thin the sugar maple woodlots, as well as learning how to tap a tree and how to protect oneself from the notorious black flies. One of the students reports that she was able to use the skills and experience learned in the auto mechanics class to hire on as a Journeyman marine machinist repairing diesel engines onboard Navy ships in Alameda, California. In 1975, that same year, the college was denied a US$560,000 federal grant to support an experimental cooperative project with a local school district that met with opposition by both Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr. and the Manchester Union Leader.Maeroff, Gene. \\"Liberal College Is Denied Federal Grant,\\" New York Times, July 6, 1975: 32.

One of the distinguishing marks of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy is that, since its foundation, its members are required to take a fourth vow: to die, if necessary, for another who is in danger of losing their faith. The Order exists today in 17 countries.  General background  Between the eighth and the fifteenth centuries, medieval Europe was in a state of intermittent warfare between the Christian kingdoms of southern Europe and the Muslim polities of North Africa, Southern France, Sicily and Moorish portions of Spain. According to James W. Brodman, the threat of capture, whether by pirates or coastal raiders, or during one of the region's intermittent wars, was a continuous threat to residents of Catalonia, Languedoc and the other coastal provinces of medieval Christian Europe.Brodman, James William, Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain:The Order of Merced on the Christian- Islamic Frontier, 1986 Raids by militias, bands and armies from both sides were an almost annual occurrence.Ibn Khaldun, Histoire des Berb√®res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale, ed. Paul Casanova and Henri P√©r√®s, trans. William MacGuckin, baron de Slane (Paris, 1925-56), 3: 116-17 For over 600 years, these constant armed confrontations produced numerous war prisoners on both sides. Islam‚Äôs captives were reduced to the state of slaves since they were considered war booty. In the lands of Visigothic Spain, both Christian and Muslim societies had become accustomed to the buying and selling of captives, so much so that tenth-century Andalusian merchants formed caravans to purchase slaves (\\"Slavs\\") in Eastern Europe. In the thirteenth century, in addition to spices, slaves constituted one of the goods of the flourishing trade between Christian and Muslim ports. Starting before the First Crusade, many hospices and hospitals were organized by the chapters of cathedrals or by the monastic orders. Within the communal organizations of towns, local charitable institutions such as almshouses were established by confraternities or guilds, or by successful individual laymen concerned with the welfare of their souls. Broader-based and aristocratically-funded charitable institutions were more prominent, and the episodes of aristocratic and even royal ransom and its conditions, were the subject of chronicle and romance. The knights of the original Order of St John--the Knights Hospitaller --and the Templars in their origins are well known, and the impact of their organized charity upon the religious values of the High Middle Ages. Peter Nolasco (1189-1256)  Peter Nolasco  Sources for the origins of the Mercedarians are scant and almost nothing is known of the founder, Peter Nolasco. A narrative developed between the 15th and early 17th centuries that culminated in Nolasco's canonization as a saint in 1628. All the biographers agree that, at some point in his youth, Nolasco became concerned with the plight of Christians captured in Moorish raids and that he decided to establish a religious order to succor these unfortunates. Nolasco began ransoming Christian captives in 1203. After fifteen years of work, he and his friends saw that the number of captives was growing day by day. His plan was to establish a well-structured and stable redemptive religious order under the patronage of Blessed Mary.Allaria, Anthony. \\"St. Peter Nolasco.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 February 2013  The Foundation of the Order  The Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy (or the Order of Merced, O.Merc., Mercedarians, the Order of Captives, or the Order of Our Lady of Ransom) was one of many dozens of associations that sprang up in Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries as institutions of charitable works. The work of the Mercedarians was in ransoming impoverished captive Christians (slaves) held in Muslim hands, especially along the frontier that the Crown of Aragon shared with al-Andalus (Muslim Spain). The Order of Mercy, an early 13th century popular movement of personal piety organized at first by Nolasco, was concerned with ransoming the ordinary men who had not the means to negotiate their own ransom, the \\"poor of Christ.\\" =Hagiographical origins= From the year 1192 certain noblemen of Barcelona had formed a confraternity for the purpose of caring for the sick in hospitals, and also for rescuing Christian captives from the Moors. Tradition has it that around 1218, Nolasco and King James I of Aragon experienced separately a vision of the Virgin Mary, who asked them to found a religious order dedicated to rescuing the many Christian captives held by the Muslims. Nolasco's confessor, Raymond of Penyafort, a Dominican friar and former canon of Barcelona, encouraged and assisted him in this project; and King James also extended his protection. On August 10, 1218, the new religious order for the Redemption of Captives was officially constituted at the main altar erected over Eulalia of Barcelona's tomb in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (also known as the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia) in Barcelona. Bishop Berenguer de Palou gave Nolasco and his companions the white religious habit that they would wear as characteristic of the Order; he put them under the Rule of Saint Augustine as a norm for their life in common and he gave his authorization for the sign of his cathedral, the Holy Cross, to be on the habit of the Order. After that, Nolasco and the first Mercedarians made their religious profession there before the bishop. Their headquarters was the Monastery of St. Eulalia of Barcelona, which served as the first Mercedarian convent and as a house of welcome for redeemed captives. =Documentary records= Reconstructing the Order's beginnings from the documentary record produces a far less detailed story. In this, the year 1218 plays no role. The founder first appears ca. 1226 as a collector of alms in Perpignan. By 1230 he was collecting alms for captives in Barcelona as the head of a small lay confraternity. On August 12, 1230, Maim√≥ Gombal, a resident of Barcelona and a man of some property, directed in his will that 100 Papal States scudi be handed over to Nolasco for the ransoming of captives. The bequest was not unusual, either in amount or intent, for Catalans of this era frequently included this pious good work in their testaments. What sets this particular bequest apart is that it contains the first notice of the redeeming work of Nolasco. Nothing is known about him before his appearance in Maim√≥'s will and only very little afterwards. During the next six years, the confraternity slowly evolves into a religious order, as members obtain properties in Catalonia. While Nolasco, by all accounts, first established his movement at Barcelona and then on Mallorca, its first acquisitions of note were in the Kingdom of Valencia. Here special circumstances associated with the frontier ‚Äîan abundance of new land awaiting Christian settlement and an arena for the practice of charitable ransoming‚Äî created an ideal environment for the new Order. Consequently, the preponderance of what Mercedarians came to possess here were lands donated by the king, successful crusaders and other patrons. La Merc√® basilica in Barcelona where the Mercedarian mother church, current building built between 1765 and 1775. In 1236, Pope Gregory IX granted the Mercedarians formal recognition as a religious order under the old Rule of St. Augustine. The small order gained additional members, property and support in the 1250s and 1260s. While evidence is scant, one has to assume that this support came in recognition of the Order's work in ransoming captives in a war zone that remained quite active. The growing pains, however, also caused institutional turmoil, whose outlines can only be glimpsed. The visible result was a reorganization in 1272 by a new master, Pere d'Amer. James I, whose descendants claimed him to be the Mercedarian founder, had in fact no documented contact with the Order until the late 1230s and early 1240s, at which time he granted formerly Muslim lands in Valencia, especially the Shrine of Santa Maria del Puig, patron saint of the kingdom. It was not until the 1250s that royal patronage becomes evident, when the king granted the Order his guidaticum (a form of diplomatic protection), economic privileges that promoted gifts to the Order, and, at least temporarily, the important shrine of St. Vincent in the City of Valencia. Claims by King James II and Peter IV of a royal foundation of the Order reflected not real history but their own designs upon the Order's financial resources and personnel. =Constitutions of the Mercedarian Order= Convento de la Merced, founded in 1607, is a Merecedarian convent, which now serves as a church, in the small town of Valdunquillo, in northern Castile. In the preface of the first Constitutions of the Mercedarian Order of 1272, three key elements referring to the foundation stand out: the name, the founder and the purpose of the Order. The name with which the Order founded by Nolasco is identified, is mentioned first. Prior to the 1272 Constitutions, the Order had several names among which: Order of Saint Eulalia, Order of the Mercy of Captives, Order of the Redemption of Captives, Order of Mercy. Those of 1272 established a dual patronage: The Order of the Virgin Mary of the Ransom of Captives of St. Eulalia of Barcelona. But the proper and definitive title is: Order of the Virgin Mary of Mercy of the Redemption of Captives. This name, however, does not come into general use until the 1290s and is not codified until the Albertine Constitutions of 1327. The 1272 Constitutions, further, establish Nolasco as the Order's founder:he has been constituted \\"servant, messenger, founder and promoter\\" of the new Institute. Peter Nolasco is the real founder of the Order or the \\"Procurator of the alms of captives\\" as defined on March 28, 1219, by the first document referring to him. Basilica of La Merced in Cusco, Peru, built between 1651-1696. Finally, it is clearly specified that the purpose of the Order is \\"to visit and to free Christians who are in captivity and in power of the Saracens or of other enemies of our Law‚Ä¶ By this work of mercy‚Ä¶ all the brothers of this Order, as sons of true obedience, must always be gladly disposed to give up their lives, if it is necessary, as Jesus Christ gave up his for us.\\"  The Reform  In the 15th century, a movement grew up among the monasteries of the Order seeking a stricter lifestyle, keeping more exactly the Rule of St. Augustine under which the friars live. This spread and gained approval by the Master General of the Order. As a result of the Counter-Reformation, spurred by the Council of Trent (1545-1563), this goal was revived and further developed by Friar John Baptist of the Blessed Sacrament (). A small community of friars were allowed to open their own monastery under the leadership of Friar John Baptist in 1603. Adopting a simpler form of life and of their religious habit and wearing only sandals, they became known as the Mercedarian Recollects, later as Discalced Mercedarians. They were approved as a semi-autonomous branch of Order by Pope Gregory XV in 1621. They eventually separated and became a fully independent Order.  The Fourth Vow  Some Orders and Congregations add particular vows, besides the three vows of religion. These additional vows are part of the nature of the profession of each Order and are permitted by the Church. They can be solemn or simple, perpetual or temporary. The Fourth Vow of the Order of Mercy is a Solemn Vow. In accordance with the general principle of a vow, it is an act of the will and an authentic promise, in which the reason for the vow is perfection. It also presupposes a sincere will of obligation in conscience and by virtue of the community. =The Fourth Vow in the Various Constitutions of the Order= *In the First Constitutions of the Order, the American Constitutions (1272): \\"... all the brothers of the Order must always be gladly disposed to give up their lives, if it is necessary, as Jesus Christ gave up His for us...\\" *The Albertine Constitutions (1327): \\"Chapter 28: Surrender of one‚Äôs life as hostage in Saracen Territory.\\" *The Zumelian Constitutions (1588): \\"I will be obedient to you and your successors up to death; and I will remain in person in the power of the Saracens if it be necessary for the Redemption of Christ‚Äôs Faithful.\\" *The Madrilene Constitutions (1692) and the Roman Constitutions (1895): \\"Therefore, we must understand in the first place, that all our religious are committed to the Redemption of Captives in such a way that they must not only always be disposed to carry it out in fact if the Order sends them, but also to collect alms, or if the prelates do select them, to do whatever else may be necessary for the act of redemption to be carried out.\\" *#Also in the Madrilene Constitutions: \\"We declare that this vow is essential because it inseparably constitutes our Order in its nature and substance by virtue of the early institution‚Ä¶ and our predecessors have always professed and fulfilled it.\\" *The Constitutions and Norms (1970): \\"The Mercedarian, urged by Charity, dedicated himself to God by a particular vow in virtue of which he promises to give his own life, if it will be necessary, as Christ did for us, to free from the new forms of slavery the Christians who are in danger of losing their Faith.\\" *The Aquarian Constitutions (1986): \\"In order to fulfill this mission we, impelled by love, consecrate ourselves to God with a special vow, by virtue of which we promise to give up our lives, as Christ gave his life for us, should it be necessary, in order to save those Christians who find themselves in extreme danger of losing their faith by new forms of captivity.\\" Church of Our Lady of Ransom, Eastbourne, East Sussex  Our Lady of Ransom  Eventually a feast day was instituted and observed on September 24, first in the religious order, then in Spain and France, and on February 22, 1696 Pope Innocent XII extended it to the entire Church. The Mercedarians keep this day as a first class feast, with a vigil, privileged Octave and Proper Office under the title: Solemnitas Descensionis B. Mari√¶ V. de Mercede. =Patronage= Our Lady of Ransom is the principal patron of Barcelona; the proper Office was extended to Barcelona (1868) and to all Spain (second class, 1883). Sicily took up the old date of the feast (Sunday nearest to August 1) by permission of the Roman Congregation of Rites of August 31, 1805. In England, Our Lady of Ransom is also venerated as ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Dowry‚Äù in the context of a revival of devotion to her ‚Äúto obtain the rescue of England as Our Lady's Dowry‚Äù, i.e., to reverse England‚Äôs formal separation from the Roman Catholic Church and restore papal supremacy. In the Philippines, particularly Barangay Mercedes, Catbalogan City, Roman Catholics have been devoted to Nuestra Se√±ora de las Mercedes as their principal patroness, often invoked for protection against Moro raiders.

Harvey is shunned by his classmates at a private boarding school, and eventually suspended for bad behavior. His father therefore takes him on a business trip to Europe, travelling there by trans-Atlantic steamship. Mid-passage, Harvey falls overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is rescued by a Portuguese- American fisherman, Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy), and taken aboard the fishing schooner \\"We're Here\\", from Gloucester, Massachusetts. Harvey is shocked the schooner's captain, Disko Troop (Lionel Barrymore), intends fishing in the Atlantic for three more months. He fails to persuade the captain to take him back to New York nor can he convince him of his wealth; but Captain Troop offers Harvey temporary crew membership until they return to port. Harvey is reluctant to do real work but eventually accepts. Befriended by Captain Troop's son, Dan (Mickey Rooney), he becomes acclimated to the demanding fishing lifestyle. The We're Here fills with fish they catch. When a prank of Harvey's causes a fish hook to lodge in a crewman's arm, Manuel defends the boy. In the climactic race back to the Gloucester, Massachusetts port against a rival schooner, the Jennie Cushman, Manuel climbs to the top of the mast to furl the sail. However, the mast cracks and he is plunged into the icy sea, tangled in the rigging that will cut him in half. Manuel speaks to the cook in Portuguese and the cook tells the Captain: All the bottom half of him is gone, and he doesn't want the boy to see. He tells the captain to cut him free from the boat, knowing this will kill him. Harvey crawls out on the wreckage, crying and distraught, while the captain strikes blow after blow after blow with the ax until the rigging finally parts. Manuel kisses the cross around his neck and sinks below the water. The schooner returns to port and Harvey is reunited with his father, who is impressed by his son's maturity. Harvey grieves for Manuel, pushing his father away and wanting to stay on the We're Here, but Disko reassures Cheyne, telling him that there is room in Harvey's heart for both men and that once there he ‚Äúwill find Manuel mighty satisfactory company.‚Äù At the church, Harvey lights two candles, one from Manuel to his father and one from him to Manuel. His father overhears Harvey praying that someday he will be with Manuel again and follows the boy to Manuel's dory, floating near the ship. Harvey is inconsolable and begs Cheyne to leave him alone. The next day, in front of the Fisherman's Memorial, he and his father join the Gloucester community in casting bouquets and wreaths on the outgoing tide in tribute to the men and boys lost during this fishing season. The last shot shows the Cheyne's car, speeding down the road with Manuel's dory on a trailer behind. Through the side window, we see that Harvey is laughing and gesturing, regaling his father with stories of his adventures.

The film is considered a classic semi-documentary record of Grand Banks Schooners fishing under sail. The back projection shots of the period fishing schooners under sail are frequently watched by members of the American Sail Training Community for the sailing shots - rather than for the human plot.

Russ Meyer and then Jonathan Kaplan were due to direct from a script by Roger Ebert and Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren. Development McLaren wanted to use the film as a vehicle for the Sex Pistols to break into the American market as opposed to releasing a single or an album. \\"The Sex Pistols are not a 'music group',\\" said McLaren. \\"They play music and they write songs but they are more of a social event. With a film we can demonstrate very clearly the whole social condition the band came out of and deliver that in its pure and undiluted form to everyone outside the UK.\\" The Pistols were fans of Meyer's film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, and McLaren hired him to make the film. \\"McLaren was sincere,\\" recalled Meyer. \\"He was really a zealot. He had fire in his eyes.\\" =Scripting= A script was written by Roger Ebert, who had co written Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Ebert had never heard of the band, and says Meyer told him \\"We can go wild on this. I've got a couple of big-titted London girls already in mind.\\" (A script had apparently been written by Rene Daalder, but Meyer discarded it.) The film was intended as a punk rock version of A Hard Day's Night. Meyer said it was \\"more on the order of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Instead of four girls, I had four boys. It was about this supposedly aging rock star who was prone to go out into the Queen's Reserve, shoot a deer, and then give it to the poor. He was dressed in livery and had a convertible Rolls Royce.\\" According to Ebert, \\"McLaren thought of Meyer as a fascist. Meyer thought of McLaren as a source for money to make an RM film.\\" The working title was Anarchy in the UK, after one of the band's most famous songs. =Rehearsal= According to Meyer, the sets were built and the film cast. He rehearsed with the Sex Pistols. Meyer found guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook \\"very intelligent, level-headed guys\\", but thought singer Johnny Rotten and bassist Sid Vicious \\"were absolutely nuts. Both had an intense hatred for McLaren. They would call me up at two in the morning to say unspeakable horrors about him.\\" Meyer said Rotten \\"definitely had a charisma\\" and Vicious embraced the idea of sex scenes between him and Marianne Faithfull (set to play his mother), \\"but he objected to us showing them shooting up.\\" =Budget= Meyer said \\"they never really knew\\" what the budget was \\"because McLaren had no conception of what it would cost. We did some eight versions of the script... The conception from the beginning was based on a lack of knowledge. And I have to include myself in that.\\" Meyer says originally McLaren had committed only ¬£150,000 with no expense for the Sex Pistols. Meyer said this would not cover one quarter of the film. However the Sex Pistols' popularity increased, so McLaren could get $300,000 from Warner Bros and an extra amount of money from 20th Century Fox in England to bring finance up to $1 million. \\"But the budget was like $1.7 million,\\" said Meyer. \\"Everyone was pulling their hair.\\" Filming Filming started in October 1977. Meyer filmed for three days (though no footage involved the band). Then 20th Century Fox withdrew and shooting was abandoned. =Reasons for cancellation= According to Meyer, Grace Kelly \\"got involved in it. She despises me, and she's an important stockholder at Fox. She was going to pull out all support of Fox in Europe.\\" This was confirmed in media reports at the time. McLaren said Fox pulled out after reading the screenplay. Ebert says \\"This seems unlikely because the studio would not have green-lighted the film without reading the script.\\" Ebert wrote that Meyer said \\"McLaren had made false promises of financing and was broke. Electricians and others had walked off after not being paid. Meyer himself demanded each week's salary be deposited every Monday morning.\\" \\"To get in that situation where you're just the director and not the producer where you can call the shots-it's a very frustrating experience,\\" said Meyer. Sets that had been built at Bray Studios in Berkshire were destroyed. Meyer and the Sex Pistols both wound up suing each other. \\"Too bad it couldn't have been made,\\" said Meyer. \\"Probably Vicious would still be living.\\" Great Rock and Roll Swindle Following Meyer's departure, Jonathan Kaplan was briefly attached to the project. McLaren eventually made The Great Rock and Roll Swindle with director Julien Temple, the trailer for which included the title shot of a deer being killed. This scene was not, however, in the finished film. A song with the same name is also featured in the film, sung by Edward Tudor-Pole. Additional footage appeared in the 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury. In April 2010, Roger Ebert posted the screenplay of Who Killed Bambi? (originally titled Anarchy in the UK) on his blog.

The item is currently in the Collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum. London is a poem by William Blake, published in Songs of Experience in 1794. It is one of the few poems in Songs of Experience that does not have a corresponding poem in Songs of Innocence. Blake lived in London so writes of it as a resident rather than a visitor. The poems reference the \\"Two Contrary States of the Human Soul\\". The \\"Songs of Innocence\\" section contains poems which reference love, childhood and nature. Critics have suggested that the poems illustrate the effects of modernity on people and nature, through the discussion of dangerous industrial conditions, child labour, prostitution and poverty.

It is one of the few poems in Songs of Experience that does not have a corresponding poem in Songs of Innocence. Blake lived in London so writes of it as a resident rather than a visitor. The poems reference the ‚ÄúTwo Contrary States of the Human Soul‚Äù. The ‚ÄúSongs of Innocence‚Äù section contains poems which reference love, childhood and nature. Critics have suggested that the poems illustrate the effects of modernity on people and nature, through the discussion of dangerous industrial conditions, child labour, prostitution and poverty. This poem is taken from ‚Äúsongs of experience‚Äù. It reveals the poet‚Äôs feelings towards the society in which he lived. England in the 1800s became very oppressive, influenced by the French Revolution. It started to impose laws which restrict the freedom of individuals.‚ÄúAt first, Blake loved London, he wrote that ‚Äúgolden London and her silver Thames, throng‚Äôd with shining spires and corded ships‚Äù(Poetical Sketches), but after French Revolution, the British government began to oppress the civil democratic activities. Then London was quite different from before: everything was covered with darkness, terrors and miseries.‚Äù (Zhan,2013). Thus he shows a negative picture of London and he offers a social criticism of 18th-century England. Themes * Lack of freedom * Sources for the lack of freedom * Downfall of London. Literary techniques * Structure ‚Äì four quatrains with alternate lines rhyming. ABABCDCD * Alliteration ‚Äì ‚Äúweakness, marks of woe‚Äù * Oxymoron ‚Äì Marriage hearse * Repetition: ** ‚Äúchartered‚Äù ‚Äì shows the inability to escape and reflects the suffocating atmosphere of the London city. ** ‚Äúcry‚Äù ‚Äì shows the suffering of both adults and children in London. Publishing Songs of Innocence and Experience was originally hand-printed and illustrated by Blake in 1794.Punctuation: as can be seen in the image, there are capital letters, commas, and full stops (periods). Using these as a guide, the poem read as transcribed above when first attached to the image by Blake. The text appears with some alterations and/or additions to its punctuation in later iterations-- 19th through 21st- century anthologies, reviews, etc. Was Blake ever the individual making such changes, or was it always later editors and publishers? Allusions Blake suggests that the experience of living there could encourage a revolution on the streets of the capital. This could have been influenced by the recent French Revolution. The use of the word \\"chartered\\" is ambiguous and goes against control and ownership. It may express the political and economic control that Blake considered London to be enduring at the time of his writing. Blake's friend Thomas Paine had criticised the granting of Royal Charters to control trade as a form of class oppression.Stephen Bygrave (ed), Romantic Writings, Routledge, 1996, p. 20; Tom Paulin, \\"The Invisible Worm\\", The Guardian, London, March 3, 2007. However, \\"chartered\\" could also mean \\"freighted\\" and may refer to the busy or overburdened streets and river or to the licensed trade carried on within them.E. P. Thompson, Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 176. In the original draft, the word used was simply \\"dirty\\" (\\"I wander through each dirty street / Near where the dirty Thames does flow\\"). Blake makes reference to the \\"Blackening church\\" suggesting that the church as an institution is not only physically blackening from the soot of London, but is actually rotting from the inside, insinuating severe corruption.http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126746.html Blake created the idea of the poem from using a semantic field of unhappiness. This is presented through the verbs 'curse', 'cry' and 'sigh'. Adaptations Ralph Vaughan Williams set the poem to music in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs. The poem was set to music in 1965 by Benjamin Britten as part of his song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake. The poem was set to music in 1987 by Tangerine Dream on their album Tyger; the album is based on the poems of William Blake.

History The idea of a seminary for the training of Black Baptist ministers grew out of conversation between National Baptist leaders and Dr. O.L. Hailey about the possibility of establishing a seminary for the education of its ministers, in 1913. Larry G. Murphy, J. Gordon Melton, Gary L. Ward, Encyclopedia of African American Religions, Routledge, USA, 2013, p. 41 In a resolution presented by Dr. Edgar Young Mullins and adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention in that same year, the convention pledged its cooperation and appointed a similar committee. The committees of the two conventions met together and the following year recommended to their respective bodies that the college be established in Memphis, Tennessee. It was later decided to establish the College in Nashville. The present site of 53 acres was purchased with the help of the National Baptists in 1921, and a plan calling for the management of the seminary by a holding board and a governing board representative of the two conventions was adopted. The first building, Griggs Hall, was erected in 1923 and housed dormitory rooms, dining hall, library, and classrooms. American Baptist College formally opened its doors for the training of Christian workers under the name of the American Baptist Theological Seminary on September 14, 1924. Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of African American History: 5-Volume Set, Oxford University Press USA, USA, 2009, p. 440In 1937, the Southern Baptist Convention agreed to share 50/50 with the National Baptist Convention, USA Inc. in the operation of the College. Jessie Carney Smith, Linda T Wynn, Freedom Facts and Firsts: 400 Years of the African American Civil Rights Experience, Visible Ink Press, USA, 2009, p. 83The unprecedented cooperation between the National Baptist Convention, USA Inc. and the Southern Baptist Convention created a unique educational opportunity for African American clergy to gain higher biblical and theological education for over five decades. Due to this partnership, the Southern Baptist Convention helped prepare students and a broad spectrum of church leaders who were ready to meet the challenges of the Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. Providing scholarships and fiscal support of the operations of American Baptist College, the Southern Baptist Convention made a significant contribution to the education of men and women for Christian service in the world. In order to support the future growth and flourishing of the College, the Southern Baptist Convention continued in that partnership until a joint decision to turn over the assets to the Board of Trustees of American Baptist College in 1996. Jessie Carney Smith, Linda T Wynn, Freedom Facts and Firsts: 400 Years of the African American Civil Rights Experience, Visible Ink Press, USA, 2009, p. 83 The College has educated Civil Rights champions, national leaders and Christian ministers. The school's history during the 1960s and 1970s was filled with civil rights champions, national leaders and Christian ministers. Students from American Baptist College, such as Julius Scruggs, Bernard Lafayette, James Bevel, William Barbee and John Lewis served on the front line of the Nashville sit-ins for justice and change. Under the tutelage of then Professor J.F. Grimmett, Kelly Miller Smith, and Dr. C.T. Vivian, many students sat down at local lunch counters, dramatically altering the quality of life for African Americans living in the South. They sat, marched, and persevered through arrests and beatings before they were victorious in pursuit of justice and human rights. The campus itself was a popular command post for organizing and training students for social justice causes throughout the city at the time. A number of students from that period have gone on to become major names in civil rights history and American politics (e.g., Congressman John Lewis, Dr. Bernard Lafayette, Dr. Julius Scruggs). At the time, members of the Nashville Student Movement referred to the college as the \\"Holy Hill\\". In 1971, the school became accredited and its official name was changed to American Baptist College. Walter de Gruyter and American Council on Education, American Universities and Colleges, Walter de Gruyter, USA, 2014, p. 1596The college was originally formed as a joint educational partnership between the Southern Baptist Convention and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. The Southern Baptist Convention withdrew its one of the founding fathers of the College. At its annual meeting in 1993, the National Baptist Convention appointed a committee to investigate support of the college in 1995. The college continues to serve as the primary theological training center for the NBC, USA Inc. =Civil Rights Movement= Nashville was the \\"University of Nonviolence...the movement's research laboratory...here the nonviolent sit-in was first methodically theorized, practiced, and tested... An extraordinary number of [Civil Rights] Movement leaders got their start in Nashville... Their organizational energy was felt throughout the South for the next decade.\\" Author Townsend Davis lists graduates of this \\"University of Nonviolence\\": James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, C.T. Vivian (American Baptist Theological Seminary students); Diane Nash and Marion Berry (Fisk University students). He also notes the leadership of Rev. Kelly Miller Smith (pastor, First Baptist Capitol Hill and professor at ABTS). In the recent \\"rolling history lesson\\" on the 1961 Freedom Rides [January 27‚Äì28, 2007], American Baptist College was represented by Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, C.T. Vivian and four current students as well as one of our faculty members. Rev. James Lawson spoke often during this journey of the impact of the Nashville movement on the national movement, from 1959 until now, and of the importance of American Baptist. A number of people have tried to figure out why so many of the national civil rights leaders came from American Baptist College, a small four year historically black college in North Nashville. Noting that American Baptist was seldom even mentioned, David Halberstam, author of The Children explains: \\"It was a place without pretense, without class lines...But at a time when the black church was becoming the driving force of a larger social revolution taking place in the United States, American Baptist had become a magnet for many of the most talented and passionate young blacks in the country. For young blacks in small towns in the South, dreaming of doing something for their own people, did not in those days dream of going to Harvard or Yale or Stanford Law, they dreamt of going into the Baptist ministry. Therefore the talent and the passion and the innate human strength of the students at American Baptist had nothing to do with the seeming simplicity and relative poverty of the school. It was a place filled with political ferment and passion. Its faculty was gifted and its students, many of them diamonds in the rough, were hungry to learn.\\" =Historic district= The American Baptist Theological Seminary Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 2013. The listing recognized the institution's significance for African American ethnic heritage, education, and religion, as well as its role in the Civil Rights Movement of the mid- twentieth century. Contributing elements in the historic district include the historic plan and landscape of the campus at 1800 Baptist World Center Drive in Nashville, as well as three historic buildings: Griggs Hall (built in 1924), the J.B. Lawrence Administration Building (built in 1947), and the T.L. Holcomb Library (built in 1954). College Facilities =The T.L. Holcomb and Susie McClure Library= The mission of the T.L. Holcomb and Susie McClure Library is to support the academic objectives, programs, and curriculum of American Baptist College by providing appropriate resources and services. The T.L. Holcomb and Susie McClure Library serves both the entire student body and its surrounding community. The T.L. Holcomb and Susie McClure library is a three-floor facility located in the center of campus. The Library provides research and study areas, houses the ABC Chapel and a computer lab. The Library collection contains more than 14,000+ volumes, over 200 periodicals, and a rare collection of Bibles in over 300 different languages. The collected writings of Mohandas \\"Mahatma\\" Gandhi can be found in the library's reading room. The library has also received donations from the private collections of Dr. Renita J. Weems, Harmon Wray, and Professor Janet Wolf. These donated books cover a variety of topics including ethics, politics, social justice, theology, and Christian leadership. The T.L. Holcomb and Susie McClure Library is a member of Project Athena. This membership enables the library to share resources with other libraries. The library staff also offers one-on-one reference assistance as well as the classroom instruction in research skills and the use of specific electronic databases. =T.L. Holcomb Chapel= Chapel services are required and held weekly in the T.L. Holcomb Chapel. Every service involves students, staff, and faculty with occasional guest preachers, alumni, and scholars in residence. Chapel services are mandatory and held weekly on Tuesday from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm. Vesper service is held weekly on Friday beginning at 6:45 pm (attendance not required). =J. H. Flakes and J. B. Lawrence Administration Building= The Administration building was completed in 1946 and is named in honor of Dr. J.B. Lawrence, a former Secretary of the Southern Baptist Home Mission Board. In 2011, Rev. J. H. Flakes' name was added to the administration building in honor of his work and ministry on behalf of the college. This building houses administrative offices and classrooms. =Griggs Hall= Griggs Hall was the first building constructed on the campus in 1923. It was named to honor the legacy of the Griggs family: Dr. Sutton E. Griggs was the first president of American Baptist Theological Seminary (ABTS) and his father, Dr. A.R. Griggs, served as the secretary of the National Baptist Education Board. In 1948, a fifty-foot addition to the structure was completed. The school's first cafeteria was originally housed in the basement of the hall, along with modest laundry facilities. Currently, this building is undergoing renovation. =Baptist World Center= Dedicated in 1989, the Baptist World Center was constructed as a state-of-the-art Official International Headquarters for the National Baptist Convention USA, Inc. It is the very first building of its kind erected by the convention. The Baptist World Center is located on the south edge of the campus, on the original site of the former National Baptist Missionary Training center. It houses administrative offices of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and is used by American Baptist College for classroom space, events, workshops, and the campus dining hall. The sanctuary is large enough to accommodate the Annual Mid-Winter Board Meeting of the National Baptist Convention USA, Inc., as well as annual lectures and major conferences and convocations of the college. =John R. Lewis and Julius R. Scruggs Leadership Development Center= The Lewis-Scruggs building was opened in 2005 and named in honor of two ABC alumni, Congressman John R. Lewis (D-GA) and Rev. Dr. Julius R. Scruggs, ABC Board Member and Vice President at Large, National Baptist Convention, USA, Incorporated. The Leadership Center is located behind the T.L. Holcomb Library and Susie McClure Library =Alumni Hall= Alumni Hall is a single-story structure that was named in honor of the College's alumni. The hall, located near student apartments on the north edge of campus, is used to house the department of Campus Operations. Student activities American Baptist College has a variety of organizations, committees, and activities. =The Garnett-Nabrit Lectures= The Garnett- Nabrit Lectures (GNL) is an annual event held each spring to honor the legacy of the former Dean, Dr. J.H. Garnett and Dr. J.M. Nabrit, fourth President of the college. The lecture series, initiated in 1958, grew out of the annual Ministers and Missionary Conference that began in 1937. American Baptist College hosts this annual event on campus at the World Baptist Center. Religious scholars and preachers are selected to address issues relevant for service and leadership. The lecture series provides a forum for church leaders, as well as students, to listen to, interact with, and be inspired by noted scholars, pastors, and laypersons. The Garnett-Nabrit Lectures is the premier lecture series of the year held at American Baptist College. During the lecture series, alumni return to campus to take part in the tradition of academic enrichment. This time of homecoming allows former students to interconnect with current and prospective students providing a lasting heritage for American Baptist College. Attendance is highly recommended for all enrolled students. =Founders Day= Representatives of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and the Southern Baptist Convention founded the American Baptist Theological Seminary, now known as the American Baptist College, on May 6, 1924. The College observes this day annually with a special service commemorating the event. Generally, special pre-Founders Day activities are sponsored on campus throughout the week and a Founders Day Memorial Service for the community of American Baptist College including the Alumni Association. =Discovery Week= Discovery Week at American Baptist College is a campus wide engagement with the Nashville at large community and beyond and path seekers who desire vocational guidance for relevant spirituality, biblical studies, and theological education. =ABC Day= American Baptist College seeks to develop leaders who aspire to become prophetic in their preaching and teaching ministry. Therefore, ABC Day allows for the college to partner up with churches in various cities to provide opportunities for students to go and preach and represent the college as future leaders and preachers. ABC Day is often held in the Spring semester each academic year. =Student Government Association (SGA)= All students at American Baptist College carrying six hours or more are members of the Student Government Association (SGA). It is the purpose of SGA to promote the welfare of the student body and to maintain high standards of conduct for all students.

Family and education Nathaniel Jocelyn was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of clockmaker and engraver Simeon Jocelin and Luceanah Smith. He trained under his father as a watchmaker, later taking up drawing, engraving, and oil painting. He studied engraving with George Munger around 1813; they published at least one print together under the name Jocelin & Munger. In 1817, Munger painted one of the few known portraits of Jocelyn. The inventor Eli Whitney also helped to foster his career, and in 1820 he briefly worked in the studio of Samuel F. B. Morse. Later, in 1829‚Äì30, he furthered his education by touring Europe with Morse and the architect Ithiel Town. During the War of 1812, at the age of 16, he volunteered for the Governor's Foot Guard, which defended the city of Madison, Connecticut. In 1818, he married Sarah Atwater Plant of New Haven. They had six daughters and a son, Isaac, who died at the age of six. Career leftIn 1817, Jocelyn moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where helped set up the Hartford Graphic and Bank Note Engraving Company. From 1820 to 1822 he lived in Savannah, Georgia, where he established himself as a painter of portraits and miniatures. On returning to New Haven in 1822, he continued as a portraitist. He was an abolitionist, and among his sitters were several notable abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison declared that Jocelyn's portrait was a \\"tolerable likeness,\\" but remarked that \\"those who imagine that I am a monster, on seeing it will... deny its accuracy, seeing no horns about the head.\\" Another of Jocelyn's well-known works is his 1839 portrait of Joseph Cinqu√©, leader of a revolt on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad. Jocelyn and his brother Simeon were also active in seeking legal counsel for Cinqu√©'s defense. In 1827 he was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design, and he became a full Academician in 1846. Throughout his career, he often showed work at the academy's annual exhibitions. Jocelyn continued as an engraver alongside his portrait business. In the 1830s, he and his brother Simeon Smith Jocelyn founded and ran an engraving company under the name N. & S. S. Jocelyn. From 1843 to 1847, Jocelyn had a second portrait studio in New York City. His New Haven studio burned in 1849, and for a time he gave up painting for engraving, initially with the firm of Toppan, Carpenter & Co. He went on to found the National Bank Note Engraving Company, where he served as head of the art department through to the end of the Civil War. After the war, he returned to painting, working out of a studio provided for him at the recently founded Yale School of Art, where he served as curator of Italian art. He retired in 1864 and died in New Haven. Legacy In 1858, Jocely and his brother gave a piece of land to the city of New Haven to be used as public park and playground. It is now known as Jocelyn Square. Many of Jocelyn's portraits are in the collection of Yale University.

History The first release of the 1999 eponymous album was 'home-made' and included many demos produced for various major labels. 3,000 copies of the album were pressed by indie label Global Warming (later to become Series 8) set up by Trevor Holden. The album sold out after receiving good reviews, including a 5-star review in Uncut magazine, and recommended album in Time Out London. When the band signed to Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures label a decision was made to re-record the majority of the album (two tracks, including 'Last Good Day of the Year', were not changed).

Life He was the son of Bartholomew Burghersh the elder, adopted his father's profession of arms and rivalled him in military distinction. His recorded career begins in 1339, when he accompanied Edward III in his expedition to Flanders and took part in the first invasion of French territory. We find his name also as attending the king on his third inglorious and unprofitable campaign in Brittany in 1342-3. In 1346, he was one of the retinue of Edward the Black Prince, then in his fifteenth year, in the Battle of Cr√©cy, and in the following year was present at the siege of Calais, being rewarded for his distinguished services there by a rich wardship. In 1349, he was in the campaign in Gascony. On the institution of the Order of the Garter in 1348, he was chosen to be one of the first knights companions. In 1354, he fulfilled a religious vow by taking a journey to the Holy Land. On his return home, he joined the Black Prince in the expedition, in 1355. He was one of the most eminent of the commanders of the invading army, and had a leading share in the events of the campaign, especially in the battle of Poitiers, 19 September 1356. A daring exploit of Burghersh is recorded by Froissart shortly before the battle. In company with Sir John Chandos and Sir James Audley, and attended by only four-and-twenty horsemen, he made an excursion from the main body of the army, and, falling on the rear of the French army, took thirty-two knights and gentlemen prisoners. His prowess and skill were again tried about the same time, when, on his return with a small foraging party at Romorantin near Berry, he was attacked from an ambuscade by a much more formidable force, which, however, he managed to keep at bay till relieved by the Black Prince. During this campaign his father, Lord Burghersh, died, and he received livery of his lands as his heir. In 1359, he again accompanied Edward III on his last and most formidable invasion of France, ending in the decisive treaty of Bretigny, 8 May 1360. He was deputed to aid in the negotiation of this treaty between ‚Äòthe firstborn sons of the kings of England and France‚Äô at Chartres, for which letters of protection were given him. He and his brother commissioners were taken prisoners in violation of the bond, and Edward had to interpose to obtain their liberation. During this campaign Knighton records his successful siege of the castle of Sourmussy in Gascony, in which he appears to have evidenced no common skill. In 1362, he was appointed one of the commissioners on the state of Ireland. When, in 1364, King John II of France, to make atonement for the Louis I, Duke of Anjou‚Äôs breach of faith, determined to yield himself back to captivity, to die three months alter his Landing at the Savoy Palace, Burghersh was one of the nobles deputed to receive him at Dover and conduct him by Canterbury to Edward‚Äòs presence at Eltham. In 1366, he was one of the commissioners sent to Urban V, who had rashly demanded the payment of the arrears of the tribute granted by King John. His death took place in 1369. By his desire, he was buried in the lady chapel of Walsingham Abbey. Family He married before 10 May 1335 Cecily de Weyland, by whom he had one daughter: * Elizabeth Burghersh (c. 1342-1409), suo jure Baroness Burghersh, she married Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer before December 1364. After the death of Cecily, he married Margaret Gisors, by whom he had no children.

Abdelwahid was born in Marrakech in 1185 during the reign of Yaqub al-Mansur, in 1194 he moved to Fes to pursue his studies, but continued traveling back and forth between the two cities for academic purposes. In 1206 he left for al-Andalus where he stayed for nine years before returning to Morocco. In 1224 he completed Kitab al- mujib fi talkhis akhbar ahl al-Maghrib (The pleasant book in summarizing the history of the Maghreb), a history of the Almohad dynasty as well as the preceding dynasty of the Almoravids coupled with a summary of Al Andalus history from the Muslim conquest until 1224. The book was written in a lighthearted spirit with many anecdotes; Abdelwahid explained that his intention was to inform and entertain the students in a summarized way since academic history books tend to be overly lengthy which can sometimes bore the reader. The book contains valuable information about Ibn Rushd (a contemporary of Abdelwahid) as well as information directly taken from the Almohad archives, various princes and accounts of events that the author witnessed. Although he vowed respect for the Almohad dynasty and its founding tribe the Masmuda, the book was fairly objective as it contained criticism of the actions of some of its kings as well as a neutral account of the dynasty's founder Ibn Tumart and his teachings. Another aspect of this is the account about the Almoravids, who were the rivals of the Almohads, but were properly credited with their good deeds. Additionally events of in-fighting between the Almohad princes were properly reported, contrary to Ibn Abi Zar, writing a century later under the Marinids, who omitted to report about significant plots and revolts that occurred during his lifetime. Abdelwahid finished his life in Egypt, as he reported in his book that the later events of the Almohads did not reach him in great detail since he was away.

All are designs by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), and are based on previous Boiling Water Reactor designs. Passive safety system The passive safety systems in an ESBWR operate without using any pumps, which creates increased design safety, integrity, and reliability, while simultaneously reducing overall reactor cost. It also uses natural circulation to drive coolant flow within the reactor pressure vessel (RPV); this results in fewer systems to maintain, and precludes significant BWR casualties such as recirculation line breaks. There are no circulation pumps or associated piping, power supplies, heat exchangers, instrumentation, or controls needed for these systems. ESBWR's passive safety systems include a combination of three systems that allow for the efficient transfer of decay heat (created from nuclear decay) from the reactor to pools of water outside containmentthe Isolation Condenser System, the Gravity Driven Cooling System, and the Passive Containment Cooling System. These systems utilize natural circulation based on simple laws of physics to transfer the decay heat outside containment while maintaining water levels inside the reactor, keeping the nuclear fuel submerged in water and adequately cooled. In events where the reactor coolant pressure boundary remains intact, the Isolation Condenser System (ICS) is used to remove decay heat from the reactor and transfer it outside containment. The ICS system is a closed loop system that connects the reactor pressure vessel to a heat exchanger located in the upper elevation of the reactor building. Steam leaves the reactor through the ICS piping and travels to the ICS heat exchangers which are submerged in a large pool. The steam is condensed in the heat exchangers and the denser condensate then flows back down to the reactor to complete the cooling loop. Reactor coolant is cycled through this flow path to provide continuous cooling and to add water to the reactor core. In cases where the reactor coolant pressure boundary does not remain intact and water inventory in the core is being lost, the Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) and Gravity Driven Cooling System (GDCS) work in concert to maintain the water level in the core and remove decay heat from the reactor by transferring it outside containment. If the water level inside the reactor pressure vessel drops to a predetermined level, due to the loss of water inventory, the reactor is depressurized and the GDCS is initiated. It consists of large pools of water inside containment located above the reactor that are connected to the reactor pressure vessel. When the GDCS system is initiated, gravity forces water to flow from the pools into the reactor. The pools are sized to provide sufficient amounts of water to maintain the water at a level above the top of the nuclear fuel. After the reactor has been depressurized, the decay heat is transferred to the containment as water inside the reactor boils and exits the reactor pressure vessel into the containment in the form of steam. The PCCS consists of a set of heat exchangers located in the upper portion of the reactor building. The steam from the reactor rises through the containment to the PCCS heat exchangers where the steam is condensed. The condensate then drains from the PCCS heat exchangers back to the GDCS pools where it completes the cycle and drains back to the reactor pressure vessel. Both the ICS and PCCS heat exchangers are submerged in a pool of water large enough to provide 72 hours of reactor decay heat removal capability. The pool is vented to the atmosphere and is located outside of the containment. The combination of these features allows the pool to be refilled easily with low pressure water sources and installed piping. The reactor core is shorter than in conventional BWR plants to reduce the pressure drop over the fuel, thereby enabling natural circulation. There are 1,132 fuel rod bundles and the thermal power is 4,500 MWth in the standardized SBWR. The nominal output is rated at 1594 MWe gross and 1535 MWe net, yielding an overall plant Carnot efficiency of approximately 35%. In case of an accident, the ESBWR can remain in a safe, stable state for 72 hours without any operator action or even electrical power. ESBWR safety systems are designed to operate normally in the event of station blackout, which prevented proper functioning of the emergency core cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Below the vessel, there is a piping structure that allows for cooling of the core during any very severe accident. These pipes facilitate cooling above and below the molten core with water. The final safety evaluation report accepted by the NRC reports an overall core damage frequency of 1.65 * 10‚àí8 per year (i.e., roughly once every 60 million years). NRC design review process The ESBWR received a positive Safety Evaluation Report and Final Design Approval on March 9, 2011. On June 7, 2011, the NRC completed its public comment period. Final rule was issued on September 16, 2014, after two outstanding problems with GE-Hitachi's modeling of loads on the steam dryer were solved. In January 2014, GE Hitachi paid $2.7 million to resolve a lawsuit alleging it made false claims to the NRC about its analysis of the steam dryer. The NRC granted approval in September 2014.http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Design-approval-for-the- ESBWR-1709201401.html However, in September 2015 the NRC withdrew the Combined Construction and Operating License application for the first proposed ESBWR unit at Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station, at the request of owner Entergy.

MITMOT high throughput Wi-Fi IEEE802.11n proposal features  This proposal was motivated by the fact that according to latest market forecasts, in 2009 one third of the mobile phones will be Wi-Fi enabled which corresponds to 200 million units sold per year to be compared to a 70 million Wi-Fi PCs volume. Thus handsets will soon capture the predominant share of the entire Wi-Fi market. IEEE 802.11n thus has to mark an evolution from the IEEE IT-centric focus towards finally capturing both the consumer electronic and handset industry technical requirements. To anticipate and contribute to this change, according to MITMOT proposal summary, it has introduced the following technical features to enable a better support of handsets: * Built-in support for asymmetric antenna configurations to accommodate various terminal sizes (Phone/PDA/PC) offering a scalable and evolutionary solution using space time block codes * Exploit the spatial diversity provided by MIMO not only to increase the peak data rate but also to grant range extension for indoor/limited outdoor operation (i.e. SOHO, corporate enterprise networks, and public \\"hotspots\\") * Support heterogeneous traffic: increase overall peak data rate without jeopardizing lower data rates modes * Focus on simple and proved technologies by considering low complexity open-loop MIMO solutions * Enhance support for low power operation to offer comparable battery lifetime to existing cellular phones with increased throughput efficiency compared to IEEE 802.11e The TGn group of IEEE 802.11 after having suspended the down-selection process in order to allow the merging of the remaining candidate proposals: WWiSE, TGnSync and MITMOT into a single Joint Proposal (JP), has elected at the January 2006 IEEE 802.11 Hawaii meeting the resulting proposal containing handset features as the task group draft.

East Semitic in green. The East Semitic languages are one of three divisions of the Semitic languages. The East Semitic group is attested by three distinct languages, Akkadian, Eblaite and Kishite all of which have been long extinct. Kishite language is the oldest known Semitic language. They were influenced by the non-Semitic Sumerian language and adopted cuneiform writing. East Semitic languages stand apart from other Semitic languages, traditionally called West Semitic, in a number of respects: historically, it is believed that this linguistic situation came about as speakers of East Semitic languages wandered further east, settling in Mesopotamia during the third millennium BCE, as attested by Akkadian texts from this period. By the beginning of the second millennium BCE, East Semitic languages, in particular Akkadian, had come to dominate the region. Phonology Modern understanding of the phonology of East Semitic languages can only be derived from careful study of written texts and comparison with the reconstructed Proto-Semitic. Most striking is the reduction of the inventory of back consonants, that is velar and pharyngeal fricatives, as well as glottals. Akkadian only preserves and (partly) as a single phoneme transcribed and usually reconstructed as a voiceless velar or uvular fricative. The sounds have all been lost. Their elision appears to give rise to the presence of an e vowel, where it is not found in other Semitic languages (for example, Akk. bƒìl 'master' < PS. *ba‚Äòal, ekallu 'palace/temple' < PS. *haykal). It also appears that the series of interdental fricatives became sibilants (for example, Akk. ≈°al≈°u 'three' < PS. *). However, the exact phonological make-up of the languages is not fully known, and the absence of features may have been the result of the inadequacies of Sumerian orthography to describe the sounds of Semitic languages rather than their real absence. The word order in East Semitic may also have been influenced by Sumerian, being subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb rather than the West Semitic verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject order.

Biography Marguerite \\"Maggie\\" Barankitse was born in 1957 in Ruyigi, East-Burundi, one of the poorest regions of the country. Of Tutsi heritage, she was a teacher at a local secondary school but was fired because of her protests against discrimination between the Hutu and Tutsi in the field. She then went to work as a secretary for the Catholic bishop in Ruyigi.Nekita Ink, \\"Extraordinary Women: Celebrating Marguerite Barankitse 'Angel of Burundi'\\", June 2017, https://nekitaink.wordpress.com/2017/06/04/extraordinary-women-celebrating- marguerite-barankitse-angel-of-burundi/ Despite mounting tensions, Barabkitse put her dream of ethnic harmony into practice by adopting seven children: four Hutus and three Tutsis. As violence escalated between the two tribes following the assassination of the first democratically elected president of Burundi, a group of armed Tutsis descended on Ruyigi on October 23, 1993, to kill the Hutu families who were hiding in the Bishop's manor. Barabkitse had managed to hide many of the children but was caught by the fighters. They beat and humiliated her and forced her to watch the killing of 72 Hutus, but she refused to tell them where the children were hidden.University of Notre Dame, \\"The Courage of Giving Refuge: Marguerite Barankitse\\", http://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/events/barankitse/ Ultimately, she was spared only because of her Tutsi heritage. After the ordeal, Barankitse gathered her adopted children and the surviving orphans and hid them in a nearby school. As more and more children sought shelter with her, she decided to create a small nongovernmental organisation: Maison Shalom, the House of Peace. Her house was open to children of all ethnic origins: Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa.

Before the current crisis in Burundi, the organisation employed more than 270 people, including nurses, psychologists, and educators who implemented special projects for the children. In April 2015, Barabkitse spoke out against the third term of President Pierre Nkurunziza and joined the youth demonstrations denouncing him.

In the province of Ruyigi, disaster struck on 24 October. To exact vengeance for the killing of members of their ethnic group, the Tutsi hunted the town's Hutus, who were hiding in diocese buildings. Barankitse, a Tutsi, was also there, and she tried to reason with the group of Tutsi to not to use violence.

() In May 1994, the Roman Catholic bishop of Ruyigi, Bishop Joseph Nduhirubusa agreed to transform a former school into a children's shelter called 'Maison Shalom'. It was named so named by the children, in memory of a song heard on the radio at the time, and because the word \\"peace\\" in Kirundi had been instrumentalized and defiled by the slaughterers on both sides of the conflict.P√®res Blancs, Voix d'Afrique N¬∞83, \\"Maggy et la Maison Shalom\\", http://peresblancs.org/maison_shalom.htm Maison Shalom's focus was predominantly children, including child soldiers, orphans, mutilated children, and minors in prison. However, its services were available to the entire community, having an impact not only on the lives of orphans but also the entire region that could access to its services. Maison Shalom's activities soon also expanded to other cities such as Butezi and Gizuru, where Barankitse opened other children's shelters.

Wescam Inc. is a subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies. The name has become synonymous with cameras of the type although several organizations around the world manufacture similar systems. Wescam is based in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. History A Bell LongRanger fitted with a Wescam gyro-stabilised camera In 1959, the military division of Westinghouse Canada developed a stabilized camera mount for the Canadian Defense Research Establishment. The product was named WESSCAM - Westinghouse Steered Stabilized Camera Mount. In 1974, WESSCAM inventor Nox Leavitt purchased the lab equipment and patents from Westinghouse and founded Istec Limited, Isolation Stabilization Technologies. The company had 17 employees and generated approximately $1 million in revenue. It experienced substantial expansion through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. This brought complementary technologies into the company and broadened its intellectual capability and market share. In 1994, Istec changed its name to Wescam and in 1995 Wescam went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 2002, L3 Technologies acquired Wescam. As part of L3 Technologies, Wescam has expanded its presence in the U.S., and increased its base of products and service offerings to customers. In June 2019, L3 Wescam became L3Harris Wescam when their parent company ‚Äì L3 Technologies ‚Äì had a \\"merger of equals\\" with Harris Corporation. Products Wescam's primary product line is the MX-Series, which consists of MX-series turret families‚Äîthe MX-8, MX-10, MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25. These are all controlled by the US ITAR They are currently used by defence, homeland security, and law enforcement agencies as well as in televised sporting events, such as NASCAR. These products are typically mounted on fixed-wing, rotor-wing, UAV and Aerostat airborne platforms and also on numerous armoured vehicles, and marine-based platforms. =MX-10= Introduced in 2009, the MX-10 is Wescam's newest imaging system. Its fully integrated weight is 37 pounds (16.8 kg), has a 10-inch (26 cm) diameter and stands 14 inches (36 cm) tall. This small size and low weight reduce the weight and clearance requirements for installation on manned and unmanned airborne platforms. The MX-10 can incorporate several different types of sensors (up to six), including high-definition daylight and infrared sensors. Wescam has been in the process of creating variations of the MX-10 for use in a wider range of applications. The MX-10GS (GS: Ground System) has been adapted for mounting on a ground vehicle where it can sit atop a mast or tower for a higher point of view, whether the vehicle is moving or stationary. The MX-10MS (MS:Marinized System) has also been created, and Zyvex Technologies has operated it on the Piranha Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV). WESCAM's MX 10 is a compact a Multi- Sensor, Multi-Spectral imaging system for surveillance missions from light aircraft. The Wescam MX-10 thermal imaging system houses two cameras. A color camera used primarily during the day can read an object the size of a license plate from more than 750 feet away. The second camera, an infrared thermal imager, can be used during the day and at night. Infrared technology permits the flight crew to see objects that may otherwise go undetected at night. =MX-15= The MX-15 is Wescam's most popular family of imaging systems. This turret can weigh up to 100 pounds (45 kg) with a diameter of 15.5 inches (40 cm) and a height of 19 inches (48 cm). The MX-15 Family includes the MX-15, the MX-15HDi (High-Definition variant), the MX-15D (Designator variant) and the MX-15GS (Ground System variant). These imaging systems are usually installed on manned fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. =MX-20= Of the MX- Series, the MX-20 is the largest imaging system, weighing in at up to 198 pounds (90 kg). It has a diameter of 21 inches (54 cm) and a height of 26 inches (67 cm). This larger system is typically installed on large, fixed-wing aircraft, such as the P-3 Orion, and Aerostats. This turret is used for long- range surveillance as it can identify and engage subjects from over 20 km away. =MX-Series key attributes= * Simplified Installation/Integration: These products do not require external or support electronics, thus simplifying installation and reducing weight and space requirements. Wescam has also implemented common operator interfaces and Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to maintain interchangeability between turret models and platforms within a fleet. * Long-Range Optimization: MX-Series imaging systems use custom-designed, large-aperture lenses to for high magnification, state-of- the-art sensors for high resolution, and a missile-grade, solid-state Inertial Measurement Unit for \\"rock-solid\\" stabilization. * On-Board Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): While similar products often require a mounting intercase for the IMU to stabilize the camera, the MX-Series has an integrated IMU, which in turn reduces payload requirements. The IMU allows the system to have a precise, jitter-free lock on any geographic position and a very high target location accuracy, despite aircraft manoeuvres and noise in the aircraft's GPS/INS system. When connected to a GPS antenna, the onboard IMU enables the turret to point to any geographic location supplied by a third party moving map system. * Compatibility with third-party systems: The MX- Series turrets are able to downlink to third-party communications systems in order to provide a clear visual of the situation in real time. This compatibility allows a wide range of installations spanning even complex, multi-operational systems. * Continuous improvement: Wescam invests heavily in research and development in order to incorporate ultramodern technology into the MX-Series. Some contracts also involve a spiral growth path, allowing Wescam to modify the turret over time in order to fit to customers' evolving requirements. Customers Wescam serves militaries and agencies around the world.

Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy at the birthday celebration Monroe's dress from the event, designed by Jean Louis \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\" is a song sung by actress and singer Marilyn Monroe on May 19, 1962, for President John F. Kennedy at a celebration of his 45th birthday, 10 days before the actual date (May 29).  Performance  Monroe sang the traditional \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" lyrics in a sultry, intimate voice, with \\"Mr. President\\" inserted as Kennedy's name. She continued the song with a snippet from the classic song, \\"Thanks for the Memory\\", for which she had written new lyrics specifically aimed at Kennedy. Afterwards, as an enormous birthday cake was presented to him, President Kennedy came on stage and joked about Monroe's version of the song, saying, \\"I can now retire from politics after having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way,\\" alluding to Marilyn's delivery, skintight dress, and image as a sex symbol. The performance was one of her last major public appearances before her death less than three months later on August 4, 1962. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who rarely attended Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children, John and Caroline. Monroe was accompanied by jazz pianist Hank Jones.  History  President Kennedy's birthday celebration was held at the third Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, and more than 15,000 people attended, including numerous celebrities. The event was a fundraising gala for the Democratic Party. Monroe's dress was made of a sheer and flesh-colored marquisette fabric, with 2,500 shimmering rhinestones sewn into it. The dress was so tight-fitting that Monroe had difficulty putting it on; she wore nothing under it. It was designed by Jean Louis. Most notably, Monroe was accompanied to the event by her publicist Patricia Newcomb. Peter Lawford was at the event that night to introduce Monroe. He made a play on the actress's reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the \\"late Marilyn Monroe\\". Monroe peeled off her white ermine fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped. The event was staged and produced by Broadway composer and lyricist Richard Adler. It was choreographed by Carol Haney of The Pajama Game fame. Legacy Monroe's iconic dress was made by designer Jean Louis and originally cost $1,440.33 (equivalent to $ in ). The dress sold in 1999 at an auction in New York City for over $1.26 million (equivalent to $ in ). Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison subsequently purchased the dress on November 17, 2016, at a Los Angeles auction for $4.8 million. In season three of The Golden Girls, Blanche sultrily sings the song to Mikhail Gorbachev replacing \\"Mr. President\\" with \\"Mr. Number One Communist\\". In the 1992 film Wayne's World, Mike Myers puts on a bra and does an impression of Monroe singing the song as his character, Wayne, while his girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere) is on the phone. In 1994, Mathilda (Natalie Portman) reenacts Myer's scene in Leon: The Professional. At the time, she had never seen Marilyn Monroe's performance. On the January 16, 1993, episode of Saturday Night Live the musical guest, Madonna, parodied the song as \\"Happy Inauguration, Mr. President\\", alluding to Bill Clinton's January 20th presidential inauguration. Spice Girl Geri Halliwell performed the song in 1998 for Prince Charles' 50th birthday celebration, replacing the line \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\" with \\"Happy Birthday, Your Royal Highness\\". In 2002 the Texas Rangers had an actress reenact the song for Alex Rodriguez's 27th birthday. In a Season 5 episode of The Sopranos, Fran Feldstein (played by Polly Bergen) ‚Äî a longtime goomah of the protagonist Tony Soprano's late father ‚Äî informs Tony that she was also a mistress too and had an affair with John F. Kennedy during the \\"Camelot Era\\" of his presidency, who invited her to the presidential suite of a hotel with Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra and Jackie Gleason in attendance. After hearing of this, Tony returns to her house and brings a captain hat, he purchased from an auction, that was previously possessed by Kennedy. He lets her wear the hat and she begins to sing Happy Birthday, Mr. President to him in a seductive way, imitating Monroe. In a 2008 episode of 30 Rock, Claire Harper (played by Jennifer Aniston) ‚Äî a friend of the protagonist Liz Lemon ‚Äî begins an affair with Jack Donaghy and follows him without his knowledge to a charity dinner at which she performs a sexy version of Happy birthday to him in spite of the fact that it wasn't even his birthday. In a season two episode of Breaking Bad, 'Mandala,' Skyler White sings the song to her boss Ted Beneke for his birthday. In 2012, American musician Lana Del Rey reenacted the performance in the music video for her song \\"National Anthem\\", with herself as Monroe. In 2016, a trailer for the second season of the alternate history series The Man in the High Castle shows Monroe singing the song for Adolf Hitler, with the line \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\\" replaced with \\"Happy Birthday, Mein F√ºhrer\\".

Description The road has no highway number, although its northern portion is th Avenue SW (counting from Bismarck, ND, which is to the east). The Enchanted Highway extends north from Regent to the Gladstone exit on Interstate 94 east of Dickinson. Each sculpture has a developed pull-out and several have picnic shelters; the highway passes through scenic farm country with intermittent buttes. Geese in Flight is visible from I-94, standing 110 feet tall and 150 feet wide. In 2002, it was recognized as the world's largest scrap metal sculpture by the Guinness Book of World Records. History Local artist Gary Greff conceived of the project and began building it in 1989, and continues to maintain the sculptures. He took inspiration from local wildlife and historical figures, including Theodore Roosevelt. Greff's intention was to revive his hometown of Regent, after decades of population and economy decline. In 2012, Greff opened a motel, The Enchanted Castle, in Regent, continuing the theme of the Enchanted Highway. The state of North Dakota provided $75,000 in its 2019-2020 budget to assist Greff in maintaining the sculptures; prior to that year, he had used his own money and donations to pay for upkeep. The highway attracts approximately 6,000 tourist cars per year.

The first settlers were prospectors looking for gold who established a settlement called C√≥rrego de Jaragu√° on the banks of the Rio Pari. Unhealthy conditions and flooding of the river convinced the inhabitants to move the town to higher ground where they built a church called Nossa Senhora da Penha on a wide and straight street called Rua Direita, after the tradition in Portugal. By 1748 the church was ready with five altars of gold and silver. In 1776 a second church was built called Nossa Senhora do Rosario, and in 1828 a third church called Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o was completed. In 1833 Jaragu√° was made a \\"vila\\" with the name of Nossa Senhora da Penha de Jaragu√°. In 1882 the vila was dismembered from Piren√≥polis to become a municipality. In the 1960s the government finished the BR-153 highway, or Belem-Bras√≠lia, which led to rapid development of the region. See Jaragu√° for the history in Portuguese.

He is currently professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and director of the Institute for the Study of Judaeo-Christian Origins at California State University Long Beach. Eisenman led the campaign to free up access to the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 1980s and 90s, and, as a result of this campaign, is associated with the theory that combines Essenes with Palestinian messianism (or what some might refer to as \\"Palestinian Christianity\\") ‚Äì a theory opposed to establishment or consensus scholarship. Before this, Eisenman spent five years \\"on the road\\" in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East as far as India, encapsulating all these things in his poetic travel Diario (1959‚Äì62), published in 2007 by North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California and called The New Jerusalem, in which he describes the San Francisco \\"Beat\\" scene in 1958‚Äì59, Paris when still a \\"moveable feast\\", working on kibbutzim in Israel, the Peace Corps, and several voyages on the overland route to India. Life and career Robert Eisenman is from New Jersey. He was born to assimilated Jewish parentsEran Neuman, Longing for the Impossible, Haaretz, 12 May 2010. Quote (referring to his brother, Peter Eisenman): \\"I didn't know I was Jewish until I encountered anti-Semitism at the age of 10...\\" Even though he grew up in a non-Zionist and assimilated family where his father held radical leftist views.... His brother is deconstructionist architect Peter Eisenman ‚Äì best known for his design of the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, the Visitor's Center at Santiago de Compostela in Spain, and the Arizona Cardinal Football Stadium. =Education= Eisenman majored for two and a half years in Engineering Physics (a course which was intended to prepare students to enter nuclear physics), graduated B.A. from Cornell University in Physics and Philosophy in 1958. He received an M.A. Degree in Hebrew and Near Eastern Studies with Abraham I. Katsh from New York University in 1966.California State University Website http://www.csulb.edu/centers/sjco/aboutpre.html He received a PhD Degree from Columbia University in Middle East languages and cultures in 1971 with a minor in Jewish Studies and a major in Islamic law, where he studied with Joseph Schacht. He was a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the American Schools of Oriental Research, Jerusalem, Israel, 1985‚Äì86 and, in 1986‚Äì87, he was a senior research fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, Oxford, England. =Current position= He is professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and the director of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian and Islamic Origins at California State University Long Beach. He is also a visiting senior member of Linacre College, Oxford University, and was a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research (American Schools of Oriental Research) in Jerusalem. =Early life= Eisenman grew up in South Orange, New Jersey and went to Columbia High School in Maplewood, but skipped his senior year to take up an acceptance in the Engineering Physics Department at Cornell University. In his junior year Eisenman moved, first to Philosophy to study with Max Black, then on to Comparative Literature with John Senior, and then back to Philosophy to graduate in 1958 with a major in Aesthetics and a minor in Physics. =On the road internationally (1958‚Äì63)= Eisenman left college and immediately took to the road (it was the time of Jack Kerouac's On the Road published the previous year, 1957), but now not nationally, internationally. People who knew him then say he was the first to introduce American tennis shoes ‚Äì substitutes for his college \\"white bucks\\" ‚Äì as white walking shoes to Europe (see the picture at right)Eisenman sitting before the Parthenon, December, 1958. Statement is from Dieter Buhl, former Political Editor of Die Zeit. See also The New Jerusalem back cover and p. 242. and the first American \\"backpacker\\" they ever saw (Australians, New Zealanders, and assorted Europeans had been doing it earlier).See The New Jerusalem, pp. 138, 399, and variously Eisenman before the Parthenon, December 1958 Stopping in Paris, he spent the fall in Alt-Aussee in Austria; and from there to Vienna and down to Greece, to Athens and ultimately Hydra Island, where he was entertained by the Norwegian writer and poet Axel Jensen and his wife Marianne (later immortalized by Leonard Cohen in his song ‚ÄúSo Long, Marianne‚Äù). Having been accepted for graduate study in Comparative Literature at UC Berkeley, Eisenman returned to the U.S. via Paris and Cape Cod and ultimately went across the country by Greyhound Bus to San Francisco where he found a room on Russian Hill and tested the scene at North Beach. When he finally went across the Bay to register at UC Berkeley, what he saw reminded him so much of Cornell (Bermuda shorts, bobby socks, fraternities/sororities, etc. ‚Äì this was a decade before the Free Speech Movement there) that he ripped up his computer punch cards right on the Registration line in the Armory and tossed them into a wastepaper basket.The New Jerusalem, p. xi. He then hitchhiked back across the countrySee The New Jerusalem, pp. 4‚Äì5 and returned to Paris. From 1959 to 1960, Eisenman stayed at \\"the Beat Hotel‚Äù where he encountered the likes of William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, et al.,See The New Jerusalem, pictures, pp. 242ff. but he was not really interested in these sorts of persons or their scene. All this he documents in The New Jerusalem: A Millennium Poetic/Prophetic Travel Diario, 1959‚Äì62,See The New Jerusalem, pp. 7‚Äì17, 70‚Äì81, 294, etc. published in 2007 and taken directly from the free verse notebooks he kept during this period, which he in his \\"Introduction\\" and his publishers on the back cover both call \\"an Anti-Beat Manifesto\\".See The New Jerusalem, pp. xi‚Äìxiii and back cover description. For his anti-Beat sentiments and statements generally, see pp. 129, 321, 452, etc. He then went on to Israel and Jerusalem, where he had the epiphany of encountering members of his family of whom he had previously never heard (his great grandfather had gone to Jerusalem at the time of the Turks and was one of the founders of the Bikur Holim Hospital there, while his two oldest sons left him in Istanbul and came directly to AmericaSee The New Jerusalem, p. 67; also see pp. 41‚Äì44, 112‚Äì16, etc. and obituary for Morris Eisenman, The New York Times, 1/20/1948, who came to U.S. in 1888, age 14, along with his older brother, Eisenman's grandfather, and was President and co-founder with David Sarnoff in 1897 of The Metropolitan News Company, an early Zionist, great philanthropist, patron of the arts, and close personal friend of Chaim Weizmann (cf. letter dated 7/10/1942, C.W. to M.E., St. Regis Hotel, NYC), helped found the Abendblatt Yiddush Newspaper, The Jewish Forward, and Chaim Nahman Bialik and Shmaryahu Levin's Dvir Publishing Company in then Tel Aviv, Palestine, friend of Shalom Asch, and funded childhood \\"newsie\\" friend Samuel Roth's first U.S. publication attempt of James Joyce's Ulysses in 1927 and, through the Morris Eisenman Literary Fund, Yiddush writer Osip Dymow in 1942, the Second Avenue Yiddush Theater, etc.), worked on Kibbutzim in the Galilee (1960‚Äì61 ‚Äì he had previously worked on John F. Kennedy's 1960 Campaign,See \\"America, I Call upon You\\", The New Jerusalem, pp. 49, 52‚Äì59, 63‚Äì68) and finally went back to join the first Peace Corps Group to go into the field. This, curiously enough, trained at the International House at UC Berkeley, so he was back to where he had started out; but while they went on to meet Kennedy on the White House lawn and to Ghana, he was flown back to New York City because, as he saw it, he was on his way to India and the East not Africa.See The New Jerusalem, pp. 98‚Äì104. Curiously this poem, \\"America, I Call upon You\\", became something of \\"an anthem\\" for this group, ibid., pp. xi‚Äìxii Resuming his \\"Passage to India\\", he returned to Paris, and then on to kibbutzim in the Galilee again.See The New Jerusalem, pp. 107‚Äì32 The next Spring, after staying in monasteries throughout Israel, and a climactic fight with the future Israeli \\"Peace Pilot\\" at the California Caf√© in Tel Aviv;See The New Jerusalem, pp. 224‚Äì59 Eisenman made the last overland run from Cyprus, across Turkey, Iran, Beluchistan, and Pakistan by bus, train, and boat to India, where he ended his journey as a guest of, and sleeping in, the Jewish Synagogue of New Delhi,See The New Jerusalem, pp. 344‚Äì446 most of whose members were up in the Simla Hill States because it was high summer and monsoon. He returned to Paris over the Indian Ocean, up the Red Sea, and across the Mediterranean.See The New Jerusalem, pp. 446‚Äì53 Release of the Dead Sea Scrolls From about 1986 onwards, Eisenman became the leading figure in the struggle to release and free the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Scrolls had been discovered from 1948 to 1956 in several waves, but after a suggestive article by literary critic Edmund Wilson in The New Yorker magazine,\\"The Scrolls from the Dead Sea\\", The New Yorker, 5/14/55. editing more or less ground to a halt from about 1959 onwards.Baigent and Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception, London and New York, 1991, pp. 26‚Äì66; Eisenman, \\"The Desecration of the Scrolls,\\" Midstream, December, 1991, pp. 13‚Äì17. This is not to say the Scrolls were not out. The Israelis had been very forthcoming with the first Scrolls that came into their possession from Cave I.Neil Asher Silberman, The Hidden Scrolls, New York, 1994, pp. 39‚Äì67. It was the Scrolls from later caves discovered like III‚ÄìXI, which came in after 1948 and Partition and on-site excavations by persons like Dominican Father Roland de Vaux, which were the problem. In 1985‚Äì86, Eisenman, who had written his first book presenting, as he called it, \\"A New Theory of Qumran Origins\\" in 1983See Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran, Leiden, 1983. and a follow-up on James as Righteous Teacher in 1985,James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher, Leiden, 1986. received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem (also known as \\"the American School\\") where Cave I Scrolls had first come in and been photographed in 1947‚Äì48.See J. C. Trever, Scrolls from Qumran Cave 1, Jerusalem, 1974. Ostensibly he was to work on a project comparing the Jerusalem Community of James the Just to the Community at Qumran, but while at the American Schools of Oriental Research (then the Albright Institute) he found that there was nothing he could do ‚Äì all paths being barred to him. Notwithstanding, he and a colleague, Philip Davies of Sheffield University, England, went in to see one of the curators of the Shrine of the Book and were told categorically, \\"You will not see the Scrolls in your lifetime\\".Eisenman, The Desecration of the Scrolls, Midstream, December, 1991, p.13. Subsequently, he came into possession of the complete computer print-out of all the Scrolls in possession of the Israel Antiquities Authority, both those before 1967 and those afterwards at the Rockefeller Museum and, not three years later, a complete photographic archive of all previously unpublished materials from Cave IV all the way up to Cave XI. He sent a copy of this computer-generated print-out to the Editor of Biblical Archaeology Review, Hershel Shanks, which created a huge stir in the office and the campaign to free the Scrolls really began in earnest.The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception, pp. 73‚Äì83. During his stay at Oxford University as a senior fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies and a visiting senior member of Linacre College in 1986‚Äì87, a colleague had also passed him a xerox copy of 4QMMT, a document which had been talked about but which no one outside the inner circle had ever been allowed to see. This, too, he freely shared with anyone who wanted to see it as part of the campaign,This included Prof. Davies, who fatefully shared it with Prof. Zdzslaw Kapera in Poland; see The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception, pp. 85‚Äì89. and, thereafter, it made the rounds.The Hidden Scrolls, pp. 39‚Äì67, 233‚Äì245. At this time, too, he brought James Robinson ‚Äì a colleague of his at Claremont University and the Editor of the Nag Hammadi Codices (a dispute similar to the Qumran one)J. R. Robinson, The Nag Hammadi Library in English, San Francisco, 1977. ‚Äì into the mix and together they took the decision to publish all the unpublished photographs. This amounted to 1785 plates. The original publication (in microfiche form) was supposed to occur in April, 1991 through EJ Brill in Leiden, the Netherlands. However, a few weeks before publication, Brill's representative had attended a Scrolls Conference in Madrid, Spain and mistook the uproar there over Kapera's publication the year before in Poland of the samizdat copy of 4QMMT he had received from Davies for a dispute over freedom of access to the Scrolls generally. Following this, newly appointed Israeli representatives came to Leiden and talked the Brill publishers out of the Eisenman/Robinson microfiche project and into a newly conceived one of their own.The Dead Sea Scrolls on Microfiche, Leiden, 1992. So Eisenman and Robinson had to fall back on the offices of Hershel Shanks and the Biblical Archaeology Society who were unwilling to go to press before October/November of that year.A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls, B.A.S., Washington DC, 1991 The publication was contracted by public interest attorney William John Cox.Silberman, Neil Asher, The Hidden Scrolls, p. 236. While all these things were going on, Eisenman had been invited to become a consultant to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, which had become aware that it had in its archive a collection of photographs of all the Dead Sea Scrolls, donated to it by Elizabeth Bechtel. The late William Moffett, its director, asked whether he thought the library should open its archive to all scholars. He was projecting this for September, two months before Eisenman's and Robinson's own projected B.A.S. Edition. Eisenman encouraged him to do so, though he knew the library would get most of the credit for breaking the monopoly and Robinson and he very little.See \\"The Riddle of the Scrolls\\", Vanity Fair, November, 1992, pp. 224‚Äì28. Surveys, groundscans, and excavations Since 1988, Eisenman has led the Judean Desert Explorations/Excavations Project under the auspices of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian Origins at CSULB he headed. These expeditions included students from CSULB and other institutions. Its aim was to search for possible new caves that might contain scrolls. It was his feeling that, though the Bedouins in their enthusiasm to find artifacts had clearly been in almost all accessible caves, there might have been others, inaccessible to them or hidden in some manner or cave-ins. These were the best possibilities of finding new scrolls. In the first expedition, between 1988 and 1989, he and his students were involved in the excavation of a cave a kilometer or two south of Qumran, in which they found some Bronze Age artifacts, including an arrow that had evidently been shot into the cave, which still displayed its lacquer rings and feather marks, an oil jug, and the wooden remains possibly of a plough. From 1989 to 1992 Eisenman and his students conducted a walking survey of the entire Dead Sea shore and its environs from seven kilometers north of Qumran to thirty-five kilometers south, past Wadi Murabba'at, to the northern limits of Ein Gedi, mapping the whole area. In this survey they went into some 485 caves and depressions.\\"The 1988‚Äì92 California State University Dead Sea Walking Cave Survey and Radar Groundscan of the Qumran Cliffs\\", The Quman Chronicle, 9/2‚Äì4, December, 2000, p. 125; also see \\"The British had it all Wrong when Naming the Dead Sea\\", Nick Tatro, AP, 2/2/90 In 1990‚Äì91, with the help of author Michael BaigentHoly Blood, Holy Grail, London and New York, 1982 and The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception, London and New York, 1992. and radar groundscan specialist Tony Wood, he conducted the first radar groundscan of the Qumran plateau, its ruins and, in particular, the top of the various marls, including Caves 4‚Äì6 where he felt there was the best chance of finding hidden pockets that previously might not have been visible. Ground-scanning on the marls and below Cave VI did point to several such pockets and seemingly empty areas in the marls adjourning Cave IV.Michael Baigent and Robert Eisenman, \\"A Ground-Penetrating Radar Survey at Khirbat Qumran\\", The Quman Chronicle, 9/2‚Äì4, December, 2000, pp. 131‚Äì38 Eisenman on first Qumran Radar Ground-scan Expedition standing in face of Cave 4, 1990‚Äì91 In 2001‚Äì03, his teams joined an expedition led by Hanan Eshel and Magen Broshi and sponsored by John Merrill and the B.A.S. In the course of this expedition, two of his students, Dennis Walker and Ron Dubay, excavated a small building on the eastern edge of the Qumran Cemetery. They found that it contained bones: two secondary burials (and the next year one primary burial was uncovered beneath this).\\"Bones of Contention,\\" Time 8/6/01, p. 49. The next year everyone went back to do more work on the enclosure and the bones it contained and to further survey the graveyard at Qumran, which evolved into the first comprehensive map of the Qumran settlement and adjacent cemetery.M. Broshi and H. Eshel, \\"Three Seasons of Excavations at Qumran,\\" Journal of Roman Archaeology, 17/1, 2004, pp. 321‚Äì32. In 2004, they had the opportunity to return and investigate the empty areas in the marls of Cave IV, but with little result.Bill Kurtus, Investigating History: The Dead Sea Scrolls, May 2004. Theories =Dead Sea Scrolls= Eisenman claims that the preconceptions of the group of scholars around Father Roland De Vaux who first worked on the Dead Sea Scrolls led them to erroneously date the non-biblical, sectarian community documents to the Maccabean period, and to read them as the writings of a serene, retiring community of Essene monks exiled to the wilderness in the course of a dispute with the reigning priesthood of the day led by the \\"Wicked Priest\\"/\\"Spouter of Lying.\\"See F. M. Cross, The Ancient Library of Qumran, New York, 1961 and Eisenman, The New Testament Code, pp. 3‚Äì196. Eisenman reads the attitude of these documents as militant, nationalistic and zealous and places them not in the Maccabean period but the later, Herodian era ( 35 BCE to 70 CE and beyond), which means the establishment priesthood that they opposed was the collaborating, compromising, corrupt Herodian priesthood. He sees parallels between the political, religious and ethical stance of these sectarian documents and that of James the brother of Jesus, whom he identifies as the scrolls' Teacher of Righteousness, and sees 'the Wicked Priest' and 'the Man of Lying' as two different adversaries of the scroll community, the Wicked Priest being the High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, James' executioner, and the Man of Lying, St. Paul. He is critical of the ways radiocarbon dating and paleography have been employed to date the Dead Sea Scrolls, and relies instead on his interpretation of the content of the scrolls despite this being at a clash with scientific consensus.Miller, Glenn. \\"Good Question......how well- respected are the theories of Eisenman, Allegro, Thiering, and Baigent & Leigh concerning the Dead Sea Scrolls?\\" http://christianthinktank.com/iceman.html 12.April 2013 He claims to find parallels between the James-Jesus first century milieu and the scrolls' repeated allusion to \\"the Star Prophecy\\", the aggressiveness of the War Scroll and similar documents, the hiding of the Jerusalem Temple treasure as delineated in the Copper Scroll,The New Testament Code the description of foreign armies (the Kittim) invading on a much more massive scale than any Hellenistic invasion during the Maccabean period,Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran, Leiden, 1984, pp. 24, 70, and 80 and James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher, Leiden, 1986, pp. 14‚Äì30 and 75‚Äì78. and the reference to themselves several times as \\"the Congregation,\\" \\"Church of the Poor\\" and Ebionites (\\"the Poor\\"), the name of James' community as described in Early Church literature and by Paul.4QpPs 37ii.11 and iii.10 Eisenman lays particular emphasis on the scroll community's description of the Kittim's military and religious practices in their interpretation of Habakkuk 2:2‚Äì2:4 (the Habakkuk Commentary) as \\"sacrificing to their standards and worshiping their weapons of War\\", and their reference to Roman ‚Äútax-farming‚Äù across the whole of the civilized world.James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher, pp. 21‚Äì74. Interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 at Qumran The recourse to an interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 (\\"the Righteous shall live by his Faith\\"), the center piece and real building block of all Christian theology both in the Pauline corpus (Romans, Galatians, et al.) and in the Epistle of James he sees as proof positive that these documents were written more or less contemporaneously and at a time when this prophecy or proof-text was in play.The New Testament Code, pp. 51‚Äì56. In addition, he sees the interpretation in the Habakkuk Commentary at Qumran, seemingly written in the latter part of the Community's history and witnessing its fall and the fall of the Jerusalem Temple (c. 70 CE), as 'Jamesian' as opposed to 'Pauline'.James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher, Leiden, 1996, pp. vii‚Äìx, 32‚Äì42, 99 That is, first of all it is confined to \\"Jews\\" or, in the language of the Commentary, \\"the House of Judah\\", and second of all, it applies only to \\"Torah-doing\\" Jews (\\"doing\\" here, the basis of the Hebrew word for \\"works\\" throughout the Qumran corpus and also being an extremely important usage in the Epistle of James), that is, it does not apply to \\"non-Torah-doing Jews\\" and certainly not \\"non- Torah-doing Gentiles.\\"Ibid. For Eisenman this is a direct riposte and a rejection of the Pauline interpretation of this prophecy, and the basis of the Pauline theology one finds in Galatians and Romans and actually, in fact, seemingly argued against in the extant Epistle of James whether seen as authentic, not authentic, or just part of 'the Jamesian School'; and, therefore, Eisenman claims, a chronological indicator for the document as a whole.The New Testament Code, pp. 551‚Äì638, 848‚Äì938. Finally, he points to the fact that there are even collections of messianic proof-texts at Qumran which include, for instance, the Star Prophecy of Numbers 24:17 which Josephus, at the end of the Jewish War, singles out as the reason for the outbreak of the revolt, and even one dedicated to \\"the Promises to the Seed\\" or \\"House of David\\".4QTest i.9‚Äì13 and 4QFlor i.7‚Äì14. For Eisenman the Dead Sea Scrolls are Messianic, it being not properly appreciated just how messianic the Scrolls actually are. They represent \\"the literature of the Messianic Movement in Palestine\\" which he prefers to the usage \\"Christianity in Palestine\\". Though, one might call them ‚ÄúEssene‚Äù, one must take the definition for this from what the Scrolls themselves say, not necessarily what others think or say the Essenes were. Hippolytus, for instance, possibly preserving an alternate version of Josephus, thinks there are two or even three groups of \\"Essenes\\", ‚ÄúZealot‚Äù or ‚ÄúSicarii Essenes\\", and for Eisenman, this is a better definition of what the Essenes were than the more normative ones people are familiar with.Hippolytus, Refutation of All Heresies, 9,14‚Äì9.22 and The New Testament Code, pp. 939‚Äì97. For him the Essenes are what Christians were in Palestine before 'the Movement' went overseas and was Paulinized, turning it into the mirror opposite of what it was in Palestine before the fall of the Temple. For him, Acts confirms this, averring that \\"Christians were first called Christians\\" in Antioch in Syria in the mid-Fifties AD.Acts 11:26. As opposed to this, he considers the more historically-oriented sectarian or later documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls to be the messianically inspired literature of a pietist, Law-oriented, and nationalistic Party in opposition to Roman/Herodian rule in Palestine which uses the language as \\"Sons of Zadok‚Äù (in some vocabularies, ‚ÄúSadducees‚Äù) or ‚ÄúZaddikim (◊¶◊ì◊ô◊ß◊ô◊ù),‚Äù a derivate usage, in referring to itself or even \\"Messianic Sadducees\\", as opposed to \\"Herodian Sadducees\\" pictured in both the New Testament and Josephus. Call for AMS carbon dating With his attempts to get free access to the Scrolls, Eisenman claims he was the first to call for AMS Carbon dating the Dead Sea ScrollsCf. M. Baigent and R. Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception, London/New York, 1991, pp. 80‚Äì83. (the earliest carbon dating tests ‚Äì non-AMS ‚Äì were performed 14 November 1950 on a piece of linen from Qumran Cave 1, producing a date range being 167 BCE ‚Äì 233 CE.) Libby had first started using the dating method in 1946 and early testing required relatively large samples that were destroyed, so testing on scrolls only became feasible when methods used in the dating process were improved upon.Doudna, G. \\"Carbon-14 Dating\\", in Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Schiffman, Lawrence & VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000) F. E. Zeuner carried out tests on date palm wood from the Qumran site yielding a date range of 70 BCE ‚Äì 90 CE. In 1963 Libby tested a sample from the Isaiah Scroll, which gave a range between 200 BCE ‚Äì 1 CE.Carmi, Israel, \\"Radiocarbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls\\" in The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fifty Years after their Discovery. 1947‚Äì1997, Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, & VanderKam, James, eds., (Jerusalem: IES, 2000) p.881. This proposal was contained in a series of letters to John Strugnell, Eisenman wrote with Philip R. Davies of Sheffield University in England and copied to Amir Drori, the head of the Israel Antiquities Authority.Baigent and Leigh, Ibid., 5/2/89. Not two months after he and Davies made this request to the Antiquities Authority, to which they attached a recent article about AMS radiocarbon techniques, it announced its intention to run just such tests. Eisenman was not mentioned as having initiated the tests. He and Davies had included in their letter to the IAA a caveat, that \\"Opposition Scholars\\" be included in process because they claimed it was they who felt the most need for the tests and they who could identify which documents should be tested.The New Testament Code, pp. 44‚Äì51. Nevertheless, Eisenman and Davies were not included in the testing process. Eisenman disputes the findings of these tests.See Atwill, Braunheim, and Eisenman, Redating the Radio-Carbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Dead Sea Discoveries, 11/2/04, pp. 143‚Äì55. =James= As far as Eisenman is concerned, James the Just, the individual Paul actually refers to as either \\"brother of Jesus\\" or \\"the brother of the Lord\\",James the Brother of Jesus, Penguin, 1997‚Äì98, pp. 51‚Äì153, 647‚Äì816. is the historical character who exhibits the most in common with \\"the Teacher of Righteousness\\" pictured at Qumran and he considers that these events are the ones vividly portrayed in the Habakkuk Commentary. Historically speaking, it is this character who led the \\"Opposition Movement\\", including Essenes, Zealots, Sicarii, and/or Nazoreans ‚Äì even Ebionites ‚Äì and who, as ‚ÄúZaddik\\" (◊¶◊ì◊ô◊ß), i. e., \\"the Zaddik of the Opposition Movement\\", about whom all these groups revolved until his death at the hands of the High Priest Ananus ben Ananus in 62 CE as described both in Josephus and Early Church literature.Ibid. and Josephus, Antiquities 20.200 and Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 2.23 and 4.22 For him, the popularity of James and the illegality of the manner of his death at the hands of the Herodians, establishment High Priesthood, and Pharisees in 62 CE set the stage for and possibly even triggered the First Jewish Revolt against the Rome in 66‚Äì73 CE ‚Äì to say nothing of the fire in Rome, not long afterwards which, aside from his probably having set it himself, Nero was reported to have blamed on \\"Christians\\". For his part, the Jewish historian Josephus makes it clear that those he is calling \\"Essenes\\" (as opposed to these same Herodians, Sadducees, and Pharisees) participated in the uprising, willing to undergo any torture or any form of death rather than \\"eat things sacrificed to idols\\" or \\"break the Law.\\"Josephus, War 2.151‚Äì3 and Hippolytus, Refutation, 9.21 For Eisenman, these ‚ÄúNazoreans,‚Äù (◊†◊¶◊®◊ô◊ù) ‚ÄúZealots,‚Äù (◊ß◊†◊ê◊ô◊ù) ‚ÄúZaddikim‚Äù (◊¶◊ì◊ô◊ß◊ô◊ù) or ‚ÄúEbionim‚Äù (◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù) were marginalized by a Herodian named Saul (Paul of Tarsus) and the gentile Christians who followed him. This version of Christianity, as it later emerged from a gentile milieu as led by Paul, transformed the apocalyptic militancy of the Ebionite/Essene Zaddikim into a universalist peaceful doctrine. In this manner, Eisenman sees the doctrine of Christianity as largely the product of Pauline dialectic and apologetics. In so doing, Eisenman attempts to recover the authentic teaching of Jesus and/or James from the obscurity into which it seems to have been intentionally cast by resultant orthodoxy. As he puts it at the end of James the Brother of Jesus, once you have found the Historical James, you have found the Historical Jesus or alternatively, \\"who and whatever James was so too was Jesus\\".James the Brother of Jesus, Penguin, 1998, p. 963. =Paul as a Herodian= Eisenman identifies Paul as a Herodian, calling attention to Paul's peculiar version of Judaism. A presentation seeming to represent the interests of the Herodian dynasty in Palestine, as well as the intention to extend its influence into Asia Minor and further East into Northern Syria and Mesopotamia. He covered this in a series of papers and books beginning in 1984.Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran, E. J. Brill, 1984, pp. 62‚Äì63 and 90‚Äì91 and \\"Paul as Herodian\\", SBL, 1984, published in Journal of Higher Criticism, iii, 1996, pp. 110‚Äì22 and The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians, 1996, pp. 226‚Äì46. Offered as proof is Paul's salutation (if authentic), at the end of the Letter to the Romans, where he sends greetings to his \\"kinsman Herodion\\" (i. e., \\"the Littlest Herod\\") and \\"all those in the Household of Aristobulus‚Äù (the putative son of Herod of Chalcis and the ultimate husband of the infamous Salome ‚Äì in fact, their son was \\"the Littlest Herod\\").The New Testament Code, pp. 500‚Äì07 and cf. Romans 16:10‚Äì11. Proof is also found in Josephus' picture of a curious member of the Herodian family, an individual he also calls \\"Saulos\\" who shares many characteristics in common with \\"Paul\\" in New Testament portraiture. Not only was this \\"Saulos\\" involved in an appeal of sorts to ‚ÄúCaesar,‚Äù he was also involved in violent behaviour in Jerusalem (although on the surface, at a somewhat later time); and it was he who made the final report to Nero in Corinth about the Roman reverses in Jerusalem which resulted in the dispatch of his best general Vespasian from Britain.Josephus, The Jewish War 2.418, 556‚Äì58, and The Antiquities, 20.214. Finally he found Herodian traces in Paul's own outlook, his philosophy of \\"winning‚Äú or being a \\"Jew to the Jews, a Law-keeper to the Law-keeper and a Law-breaker to the Law-breaker\\" also expressed in I Corinthians 9:19‚Äì27. In his own identification of himself as of \\"the Tribe of Benjamin‚Äù (Romans 11:1 and Philippians 3:5), a claim he might have felt Herodians, as Idumeans, were making for themselves, and his founding \\"a Community where Greeks and Jews could live in harmony, etc.,‚Äù where there were \\"no foreign visitors\\", as well as in the easy access he seems to have had to positions of power, and his own Roman citizenship. Rounding out his arguments, Eisenman cites the matter of an unidentified \\"nephew\\" of Paul ‚Äì seemingly the son of Paul's sister, resident in Jerusalem (Cypros married to the Temple Treasurer Helcias? ‚Äì see the genealogiesThe New Testament Code, pp. 1010‚Äì11 and James the Brother of Jesus, pp. 968‚Äì69.). This \\"nephew\\" has unfettered entr√©e to the Commander of the Roman garrison in the Tower of Antonia who, in turn, saves Paul from ‚ÄúNazirite oath-taking\\" ‚ÄúZealot‚Äù-like Jewish extremists who take an oath \\"not to eat or drink till they have killed Paul\\" (Acts 23:12‚Äì35). Eisenman identifies this individual as Julius Archelaus, the son of Saulos' sister, Cypros. Finally, consider Paul's Roman citizenship; the philosophy of paying the Roman tax to Caesar; and placing the Roman Law above the Jewish Law as an expression of \\"the Righteousness Commandment\\" of \\"loving your neighbor as yourself\\" (Romans 13:1‚Äì10). =First to call the James Ossuary fraudulent= Eisenman was the first to publicly claim that the James Ossuary was fraudulent when it originally surfaced in October, 2002 and he did this on the first day it appeared in news articles from AP and op-ed pieces as in the Los Angeles Times‚ÄùA Discovery That‚Äôs Just too Perfect\\", Los Angeles Times, 29 October 2002. on the basis of what the inscription actually said and not on the basis of 'scientific' or 'pseudo- scientific aids like those of palaeography or patina analysis.Eisenman, The New Testament Code, London/New York, 2006, pp. 56‚Äì64. In the first place, when he actually saw the ossuary at the AAR/SBL Conference in Toronto three weeks later, it was clear there were two separate hands on the inscription, the second patently more cursive. Secondly, even if the \\"Jacob the Son of Joseph\\" part were authentic (there being plenty of ossuaries of this kind available around Jerusalem), the second \\"Brother of Jesus\\" part would have to have been added a substantial amount of time later, either in antiquity by a pious pilgrim or in modern times, by a not-very-sophisticated forger because at the time (62 CE), Jesus ‚Äì if he existed as such ‚Äì would have been no more well known in Jerusalem than his putative brother James, and probably far less so; so there would have been no need to add such a rare cognomen except to please believers. Moreover, as he said in his Los Angeles Times op ed of 29 September 2002, he would have been much more impressed if the first part of the inscription had said \\"son of Clopas'/'Cleophas'/‚ÄòCephas‚Äô or some such thing, which is how individuals connected to this family were known in Palestine in this period and not the more pat or theologically-consistent \\"Joseph\\"; or if the second part had simply added the cognomen \\"the Zaddik‚Äù (◊î◊Ç◊¶◊ì◊ô◊ß) or \\"Just One\\", which was also how James was known by everyone in Palestine at this time according to Eusebius.Eusebius quoting Hegesippus, Ecclesiastical History, 2.23.4‚Äì21.

It is the oldest known surviving wood- frame structure in Jefferson County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With . History The house was built as a manor house for the surrounding farm, which was a truck farm by the early 20th century. The house was built in two sections, typical of a farmhouse of its age. The first was built in 1834 in the Federal style, facing northward towards the Ohio River. This reflected the early rural nature of the area, before the Bardstown Turnpike, a quarter mile to the east, was nothing more than an unpaved trail. In 1873, the Federal facade was removed along with the eastern portion of the house when the signature Italianate/Eastlake facade was built facing east towards the Bardstown Turnpike, which was by this time the focal point of the area. The older portion of the house was built by William Bullock, a politician, judge and philanthropist. As a member of the Kentucky General Assembly Bullock introduced legislation to establish what became the public school system in Kentucky. His most important achievement as a politician was securing an endowment for the Kentucky School for the Blind in 1841. In 1834, he purchased of land from William Pope and constructed the house. Bullock sold the property in 1839 to Francis Thornton, a minister. Features The front, newer, portion of the house is 2¬Ω stories high, with a distinctive octagonal tower rising up for a fourth level cupola.

During the Early and Middle Bronze Age in the third millennium BCE Ali≈üar developed into a walled town. Eventually, it became the most significant city in the region. Like Kanesh (K√ºltepe) to the south, it was a center for trade attracting merchants from Assyria at the beginning of the second millennium BCE.

By the Hittite empire period 1400-1200 BCE Ali≈üar was nothing but a small provincial town probably known as Ankuwa.

Plot summary An old man named, Kim is telling his family history to his grand daughter, as she found the bones of his father. When he was a boy, Kim's father was ill, when their lands flooded. His two buffaloes have no forage. Kim takes the two buffaloes in search of good grass. He joins Lap's herding team, but One of the two buffaloes dies. Later he helps Det, who builds a new herding team with him, to reunite with his girl friend and their son, whom Det hasn't seen for 5 years. When Kim hears his father is dying, he goes to U Minh. The father reveals the truth of Kim's ancestry. A couple of strangers help Kim put his father's corpse in a safe place in the water, until the flooding subsides and he can be properly buried. Lap confirms what Kim's father told him as he died:--that Kim's true mother is the sister of Lap, whom Kim's father raped on a buffalo herding run. Kim tries to rape Det's wife. Det dies in a skirmish between Lap's and Kieng's buffalo herding teams. Kim adopts Det's son, Thieu.

There are two stipendiary magistrates, the High Bailiff and the Deputy High Bailiff, along with lay justices of the peace. The superior court of the Isle of Man is the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man, consisting of a Civil Division and an appeal division, called the Staff of Government Division. The judges of the High Court are the deemsters, appointed by the Queen (acting on the advice of the Secretary of State for Justice in the United Kingdom), and the judicial officers, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. The High Bailiff and the Deputy High Bailiff are ex officio judicial officers, and additional judicial officers (full-time or part-time) may be appointed.High Court Act 1991 s.3C Civil matters are usually heard at first instance by a single deemster sitting in the High Court. Criminal proceedings are heard at first instance before either the High Bailiff or the Deputy High Bailiff or a bench of lay magistrates, in less serious cases. More serious criminal cases are heard before a deemster sitting in the Court of General Gaol Delivery; in a defended case the Deemster sits with a jury of seven (twelve in cases of treason or murder).Jury Act 1980 s.24 Civil and criminal appeals are dealt with by the Staff of Government Division. Appeals are usually heard by a deemster (the one not involved with the case previously in the High Court or Court of General Gaol Delivery) and the Judge of Appeal. Final appeal is to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom.

Corren in 1716, several years before revestment. One special case, that also applies to the Channel Islands, is the jurisdiction of the Queen's Bench Division of the English High Court over the island in matters of habeas corpus.

His music was featured on the Dale Warland Singers Cathedral Classics nationally syndicated radio special, as well as on their concerts in Minnesota. His music, performed by his Aguav√° ensemble, has also been featured on such syndicated shows as Harmonia, Center Stage from Wolftrap, and CD-Tipp syndicated in Europe by Deutsche Welle. His cantata, Ave Maris Stella, was premiered by Aguav√° New Music Studio at the International Cervantino Festival in Mexico, and subsequently broadcast throughout Latin America. His Hodie Christus natus est premiered at Washington National Cathedral's 50th anniversary holiday concert, winning the National Young Composers Award. His quartet, Nightshade, was recorded for Aguav√° by the Corigliano String Quartet. Boyce is the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including awards from Arts International, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Indiana Arts Commission. Boyce frequently tours with Aguav√° as a pianist or singer. Born in Santa Rosa, California, United States, Boyce was raised in Sacramento where he found his first musical training singing high school choruses and teaching himself to play the piano. He went on to earn a bachelor of music degree with a double major in voice and theory/composition at California State University, Sacramento, and later a master of music degree at the University of North Texas under the guidance of Martin Mailman with a cognate in piano studying with Joseph Banowetz. He earned his doctorate at Indiana University Bloomington with teachers Eugene O'Brien and Claude Baker with minors in conducting and theory. Boyce also trained as a figure skater since he was 16, and skated with Holiday on Ice in Europe for a time in the early 80s. This experience added to his love of ballet and dance genres. He left professional skating to teach for Ice Capades Chalet at the Dallas Galleria while working on his master's degree at the University of North Texas. His education was assisted by scholarships and teaching fellowships while he worked steadily as a church and synagogue musician, a practice that shaped his understanding of choral genres. Between degrees Boyce traveled widely through the United States and Europe.

Biography He was born of a sharif family in the Anjra tribe that ranges from Tangiers to Tetuan along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco. As a child he developed a love of knowledge, memorizing the Qur'an and studying subjects ranging from Classical Arabic grammar, religious ethics, poetry, Qur'anic recitation and tafsir. When he reached the age of eighteen he left home and undertook the study of exoteric knowledge in Qasr al-Kabir under the supervision of Sidi Muhammad al- Susi al-Samlali. It was here that he was introduced to studies in the sciences, art, philosophy, law and Qur'anic exegesis in depth. He went to Fes to study with Mohammed al-Tawudi ibn Suda, Bennani, and El-Warzazi, and joined the new Darqawiyya in 1208 AH (1793), of which he was the representative in the northern part of the Jbala region. He spent his entire life in and around Tetuan, and died of the plague in 1224 AH (1809). He is the author of around forty works and a Fahrasa which provides interesting information concerning the intellectual center that Tetuan had become by the beginning of the 19th century. Among his descendants are the famous Ghumari brothers.

The Western Junior C Hockey League was founded in 1966 when the original OHA Central Junior C Hockey League, a large league, was divided up. In 1970, the Western league changed its name to the Central league. A couple years later, another league from the old Central league, the Intercounty Jr. C league merged with the new Central league.

In 1969, the Hanover Hurricanes made the jump from the Western Junior D Hockey League to the Central Junior \\"C\\". Early powerhouses in the league were the Listowel Cyclones, Kincardine Kinucks, and New Hamburg Hahns. The Hanover Barons are the only remaining team that is still a member from the founding of the league in 1966. They won two Clarence Schmalz Cups while playing in the league and dominated in the 1960s. They were promoted to Junior \\"B\\" in 1977. The league became one of at least four different leagues in the OHA to be known as the Central Jr. C league since 1960. The league may have changed its name in 1970 to the Grey-Bruce Junior C Hockey League. This lasted until 1988, as the league granted expansion to 2 teams that were not in Grey or Bruce County‚Äîin 1987, the Mount Forest Patriots and in 1989, the Brussels Bulls. In 1988, the league donned its present name, the Western Junior \\"C\\" Hockey League. From 1972 until 1976, the Central league (now the Western league) featured a variety of teams from the Niagara region of Ontario. In 1974, the majority of these teams broke away to form the Niagara & District Junior C Hockey League.

This marks the second time the Hawks have been in the loop, the first being the mid-1960s. Also, they share the same name as the Walkerton Hawks, although Walkerton's name is from the raptor (since 1999), while Mitchell's is from the Native Chief. In 2012, the OHA entered into talks with the Western League and the Southern Ontario Junior Hockey League. If successful, the northern half of the SOJHL would become the \\"Southern Division\\" of the WOJCHL, while the original teams would form a \\"Northern Division\\". In the Summer of 2013, the OHA opted to realign the SOJHL with the Niagara & District Junior C Hockey League instead.

eventually presumed dead. He is an educator, poet and an advocate of modernization.Panossian, p. 143. Reputed as the father of modern Armenian literature, he is best remembered for his novel Wounds of Armenia. Written in 1841 and published posthumously in 1858, it was the first novel published in the modern Armenian language using Eastern Armenian based on the Yerevan dialect instead of Classical Armenian. Abovian was far ahead of his time and virtually none of his works were published during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited.Hacikyan et al., p. 214. Abovian is regarded as one of the foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large.Hewsen, Robert H. \\"The Meliks of Eastern Armenia: IV: The Siwnid Origins of Xac'atur Abovean.\\" Revue des √©tudes Arm√©niennes. NS: XIV, 1980, pp. 459‚Äì468. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.Bardakjian, p. 135. Early life and career Painting in 1884 by Gevorg Bashinjaghian of the house where Abovian was born Abovian was born in 1809 in the village of Kanaker, then part of the Qajar Persian Empire,Nalbandian, p. 61. and now a district of Yerevan, Armenia.Hacikyan et al., p. 211. Abovian's family were descendants of the Beglaryan melik family in Gulistan, one of five Armenian families who ruled around the current day region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Abovian family held the position of tanuter (a hereditary lordship) in Kanaker; Abovian's uncle was the last tanuter of Kanaker. His aunt was the wife of Sahak Aghamalian, the last melik of Yerevan at the time of the Russian annexation in 1828.Haxthausen, pp. 153-155. His social origins and descent imbued him at an early age with a sense of responsibility to his people. He was born six years after his parents, Avetik and Takuhi, married. He had a brother, Garabed, who died at the age of three. At age 10, Abovian was taken by his father to Echmiadzin to study for the priesthood. He dropped out after five years and moved to Tiflis in 1822 to study Armenian studies and languages at the Nersisyan School under the guidance of Harutiun Alamdarian. Abovian graduated in 1826 and began preparing to move to Venice to further his education. However, the outbreak of the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28) curtailed his plans. For the following three years he taught briefly at Sanahin and then worked for Catholicos Yeprem of Armenia as his clerk and translator. While working for the Catholicos, the twenty-year-old Abovian met many notable foreigners, including the diplomat and playwright Alexandr Griboyedov, who was stuck in Echmiadzin en route to Tabriz in September 1828.Abov, p. 28. Griboyedov's weekly Tifliskiye Vedemosti became the first paper to publish an article on Abovian.Khachaturian, p. 29. Conquest of Ararat The turning point in Abovian's life was the arrival of Friedrich Parrot in Armenia in September 1829, a professor of physics from the University of Dorpat in Livonia (in present-day Tartu, Estonia). Parrot traveled to Armenia to climb Mount Ararat to conduct geological studies and required a local guide and a translator for the expedition. The Catholicos assigned Abovian to these tasks. With Abovian's assistance, Parrot became the first explorer in modern times to reach the summit of Mount Ararat. The project received full approval from the emperor Nicholas I, who provided the expedition with a military escort.Parrot, p. x. Abovian's mentor Friedrich Parrot Abovian and Parrot crossed the Arax River into the district of Surmali and headed to the Armenian village of Akhuri situated on the northern slope of Ararat above sea level. Following the advice of Harutiun Alamdarian of Tiflis, they set up base camp at the Monastery of St. Hakob some higher, at an elevation of .Parrot, p. 103. Abovian was one of the last travelers to visit Akhuri and the monastery before a disastrous earthquake completely buried both in May 1840. Their first attempt to climb the mountain, using the northeast slope, failed as a result of lack of warm clothing. Six days later, on the advice of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was attempted from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829.Parrot, p. 139. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north.Parrot, pp. 141-142. Abovian picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846. The Dorpat years University of Dorpat in the mid-19th century Impressed with Abovian's thirst for knowledge, Parrot arranged for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830.Bardakjian, p. 255. He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied in the Philosophy faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836.Khachaturian, p. 52. The years in Dorpat were very fruitful for Abovian who studied social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and Latin. At this time Abovian fell under the influence of German Romanticism.Panossian, p. 144. In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of Nikolay Karamzin who studied with him.Abov, p. 48. In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in St. Petersburg, then married to the Georgian Prince Alexander. Prior to graduation, Abovian learned his mother Takuhi had died. Return to Armenia In 1836 he returned home anxious to embark on a mission of enlightenment.Hacikyan et al., p. 212. Abovian's efforts were thwarted as he faced a growing and hostile reaction from the Armenian clergy as well as Tsarist officials, largely stemming from his opposition to dogmatism and formalism in the school system. Abovian was appointed as the supervisor of the Tiflis uyezd school and married a German woman named Emilia Looze (d. 1870) in 1839. In 1840 he was approached by English traveler Anne Lister, who was visiting Tiflis with her partner Ann Walker. She hoped that Abovian would guide her on another expedition to Mount Ararat which ultimately did not occur. He was dismissed from the school in 1843 and was transferred to the uyezd school in Yerevan where he encountered apathy and antagonism from his colleagues and the clergy. In the summer of the same year, Abovian was visited by two German travellers. A Bavarian professor, Moritz Wagner, from the University of Munich, arrived in May and toured the Lake Sevan region with Abovian and thereafter corresponded with him on a regular basis.Guest, p. 188. In July Abovian also accompanied Wagner on the first recorded ascent of Mount Aragats in Armenia. In August, Abovian escorted the German Baron August von Haxthausen around the province.Haxthausen, pp. xvii-xx. They visited the Abovian family home in Kanaker and attended a service at the Blue Mosque.Haxthausen, pp. 147-172 and pp. 187-191. They also visited a Yazidi encampment where they met the chief Timur Aga and exchanged pleasantries with a rider from Count Paskevich's guard. He became a trusted friend of the Yazidi community in Armenia, and when the chief returned with lavish gifts from a banquet in Tiflis organized by the viceroy of the Caucasus Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov in 1844, he organized a tribal feast and Abovian was invited to attend. In 1845 he applied for a position at the Catholicate of Echmiadzin but was not accepted. The following year, he became a contributor to Vorontsov's weekly newspaper, Kavkaz, for which Abovian wrote three articles. Disappearance On April 14, 1848, Abovian left his home for an early morning walk, and was never seen again; his disappearance remains unresolved. His wife Emilia did not report him missing for a month. Their children, Vartan (1840‚Äì1896) and Zarmandukht (later known as Adelaide; 1843‚Äì1909), were ages eight and five, respectively, at the time of the disappearance. Numerous theories have been proposed attempting to explain his disappearance: that he committed suicide, was murdered by his Persian or Turkish enemies, or arrested and exiled to Siberia by the Special Corps of Gendarmes, among others. Given his love for his children and their young age, it is generally disregarded that Abovian committed suicide. Writer Axel Bakunts put forward the theory that Abovian was in Western Europe engulfed in the Revolutions of 1848. O.

He was the first Armenian writer to compose literature for children. =Wounds of Armenia= The historical novel Wounds of Armenia (written in 1841, first published in 1858) was the first Armenian secular novel dedicated to the fate of the Armenian people and its struggle for liberation in the period of Russo-Persian war of 1826‚Äì1828. The novel dealt with the suffering of Armenians under Persian occupation. The basic concept of the novel was the assertion of feelings of national merit, patriotism and hatred of oppressors. These themes had a profound influence over wide layers of Armenian society. The hero, Agassi, personifies the freedom-loving national spirit and its will to fight against the foreign conquerors. \\"Give away your life, but never give away your native lands\\", is his motto. The story begins with an abduction of an Armenian girl by a band of thugs sent by the Persian sardar that triggers an uprising led by Agassi.Hacikyan et al., p. 213. Abovian saw in strengthening of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands.Bardakjian, p. 137. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly with the implementation of Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats. =Other works= Abovian's poetry was filled with satire best expressed in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work is a collection of fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration.Bardakjian, p. 136. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore. Legacy Soviet stamp Abovian's statue at his native village of Kanaker, nowadays part of the capital Yerevan Abovian's life is well remembered in Armenia. During the years in which Armenia was under Soviet rule, his pro-Russia stance was emphasized. Hakobyan, P. ¬´‘±’¢’∏’æ’µ’°’∂¬ª (Abovyan). Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. vol. i. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1974, pp. 32‚Äì35. Schools, streets, boulevards and parks were named after him. The village of Elar, located northeast of Yerevan, was named after him in 1961. Two years later, as the village's population grew larger, Abovyan was accorded with city status. His home in Kanaker was turned into a house-museum in 1939, and many of his original writings are preserved there. The work Abovian accomplished in the field of education was remembered. Yerevan's State Pedagogical Institute was named after him. On February 28, 1964, a medal was named in his honour (‘±’¢’∏’æ’µ’°’∂’´ ‘±’∂’æ’°’∂ ’Ñ’•’§’°’¨) and which was awarded to school teachers who showed exceptional abilities in teaching and education.

It is an oil painting with a size of by . In 1938 Abovian's grandsons brought it to the museum. When Abovian's son Vardan returned to the Caucasus, he found the painting in a badly deteriorated condition. But by Vardan's request Armenian painter Gevorg Bashinjagyan restored the portrait. He cut worn-out edges, glued it to a hard paper and then filled the cracks with corresponding colors. The painter of the portrait was Ludwig von Maydell, from Dorpat University. He painted it in the fall of 1830, when Abovian was only 20 or 21 years old. This portrait is the only painting of Abovian made during his lifetime.Charents Museum of Literature and Arts Original portrait of Abovian =Statues= Two prominent statues of Abovian stand in Yerevan. The concept of the first statue dates back to 1908 when a number of Armenian intellectuals in Russian Armenia decided to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Abovian's disappearance and raise funds for a statue. These included Alexander Shirvanzade, Hovhannes Tumanyan and Gevorg Bashinjagyan.Khanjyan, p. 35. By 1910 they had collected enough funds to order the statue. It was designed by M. Grigoryan and sculpted by Andreas Ter-Manukyan in Paris between 1910‚Äì13. The statue is high and made of bronze on a granite pedestal. As a result of a misunderstanding the statue was only delivered to Yerevan in 1925 and first erected on Abovian street by the cinema Moscow in 1933 and then moved to the children's park on the banks of the Hrazdan River. In 1964, it found its permanent home by the Abovian house-museum in Kanaker.Khanjyan, pp 36‚Äì37 The second statue of Abovian in Yerevan was erected in Abovian square in 1950. The high bronze statue was designed by Gevork Tamanian (son of Alexander Tamanian) and sculpted by Suren Stepanyan.Khanjyan, p. 39. =Film= Between 1948‚Äì84, five documentary films were produced in the Armenian SSR about the life and work of Abovian. In 2011, the documentary film Journey to Ararat on Parrot and Abovian's expedition to Mount Ararat was produced in Estonia by filmmaker Riho V√§strik. It was screened at the Golden Apricot International Film Festival in Yerevan in 2013.

Reviewed as \\"a quiet force behind contemporary music in the United States today‚Äù (www.Sequenza21.com), she has been a pioneer of new modes of classical music presentation, through the exploration of the relationship of music with other arts and technology, and the discovery of underrepresented composers (especially women and Latin American authors) with her performances of contemporary works for chorus, orchestra and new opera. She advocates for the reconsideration of the concept of art music, and she proposes the co-creative role of the listener in the value of music as art. Outside of current professional conventions, Carmen-Helena T√©llez has composed new music as her inter-artistic projects have required it. She has conducted in the United States, Europe, Israel and Latin America. After her tenure as Music Director of the National Chorus of Spain, she joined the music faculty at Indiana University in 1992, as Director of the Latin American Music Center and the Contemporary Vocal Ensemble. For these organizations, she commissioned and recorded several new works, produced 14 CDs of Latin American music, and organized several Inter-American Composition Workshops. During the 2001-2002 period, she was the Resident Conductor of the pioneering Contemporary Chamber Players of Chicago and became the Music Director of the Pocket Opera Players in New York City. In 2012, she became Professor of Conducting at the University of Notre Dame, where she founded the doctoral Choral Conducting program and has led a series of musical works with new modes of interdisciplinary presentation. She is known as a conductor of new music, even as she has continued to conduct canonic repertoire. She is the first woman on record to conduct Berlioz's Grande Messe des Morts(Indiana University, 2000). In the year 2001, she conducted the American Midwest premiere of John Adams' El Ni√±o, and in 2002 she conducted Stephen Hartke's Tituli and the second-ever performance of Ralph Shapey's oratorio \\"Praise\\". She has been responsible for several commissions and world premieres, including John Eaton's opera Inasmuch and his Mass for vocal-instrumental ensemble. T√©llez has also performed the Midwest premieres of many important compositions, including James MacMillan's Seven Last Words, Alfred Schnittke's Requiem and Lou Harrison's Orpheus. In July 2006, conducted the world premiere of MacMillan's Sun-Dogs which she co- commissioned. In October 2007 she conducted the collegiate premiere of Osvaldo Golijov's opera Ainadamar. In August 2008 she produced and conducted the world premiere of Gabriela Ortiz's opera ¬°Unicamente la verdad! In 2011 she also premiered a new interdisciplinary version of \\"Passion with Tropes\\" by Don Freund. She has also commissioned and premiered the oratorio Paradiso by Robert Kyr, and recorded the anthology of works based on Poetry by Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz by MacArthur Award winner John Eaton. With Ch√≠a Pati√±o, artistic director of Ecuador's Teatro Nacional Sucre, she developed a version in 2018 of The Magic Flute, La flauta m√°gica de los Andes, featuring aspects of Andean mythology while rewriting and completing a proposed transcription using Ecuadorian instruments. As a scholar and conductor, she has won many grants and awards from the US-Mexico Fund for Culture, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Indiana Arts Commission, the United States Information Agency, and the Circle of Music and Theater Critics of Mexico. She is a respected consultant with international organizations on contemporary composers and on Latin American music, and has written several articles on these subjects for the New Grove Dictionary of Music. Indiana University awarded her the Tracy Sonneborn Award for the integration of creativity and teaching in 2010. In 1996, she founded Aguav√° New Music Studio, with composer Cary Boyce. With this organization, she has recorded two CDs. Her current research and performance interests continues to involve the inter-disciplinary presentation of new music, in order to enhance the connection of composers with the concerns of present-day audiences and reassess the ritual role of art in our time. In 2014, she founded the collective Kosmologia, to advance new modes of music presentation.

Outliers removed by Peirce's criterion =The problem of outliers= In data sets containing real-numbered measurements, the suspected outliers are the measured values that appear to lie outside the cluster of most of the other data values. The outliers would greatly change the estimate of location if the arithmetic average were to be used as a summary statistic of location. The problem is that the arithmetic mean is very sensitive to the inclusion of any outliers; in statistical terminology, the arithmetic mean is not robust. In the presence of outliers, the statistician has two options. First, the statistician may remove the suspected outliers from the data set and then use the arithmetic mean to estimate the location parameter. Second, the statistician may use a robust statistic, such as the median statistic. Peirce's criterion is a statistical procedure for eliminating outliers. =Uses of Peirce's criterion= The statistician and historian of statistics Stephen M. Stigler wrote the following about Benjamin Peirce:S.M. Stigler, \\"Mathematical statistics in the early states,\\" The Annals of Statistics, vol. 6, no. 2, p. 246, 1978. Available online: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958876 > \\"In 1852 he published the first significance test designed to tell an > investigator whether an outlier should be rejected (Peirce 1852, 1878). The > test, based on a likelihood ratio type of argument, had the distinction of > producing an international debate on the wisdom of such actions (Anscombe, > 1960, Rider, 1933, Stigler, 1973a).\\" Peirce's criterion is derived from a statistical analysis of the Gaussian distribution. Unlike some other criteria for removing outliers, Peirce's method can be applied to identify two or more outliers. > \\"It is proposed to determine in a series of m observations the limit of > error, beyond which all observations involving so great an error may be > rejected, provided there are as many as n such observations. The principle > upon which it is proposed to solve this problem is, that the proposed > observations should be rejected when the probability of the system of errors > obtained by retaining them is less than that of the system of errors > obtained by their rejection multiplied by the probability of making so many, > and no more, abnormal observations.\\"Quoted in the editorial note on page 516 > of the Collected Writings of Peirce (1982 edition). The quotation cites A > Manual of Astronomy (2:558) by Chauvenet. HawkinsD.M. Hawkins (1980). \\"Brief early history in outlier rejection,\\" Identification of Outliers (Monographs on Applied Probability and Statistics). Chapman & Hall, page 10. provides a formula for the criterion. Peirce's criterion was used for decades at the United States Coast Survey.Peirce (1878) > \\"From 1852 to 1867 he served as the director of the longitude determinations > of the U. S. Coast Survey and from 1867 to 1874 as superintendent of the > Survey. During these years his test was consistently employed by all the > clerks of this, the most active and mathematically inclined statistical > organization of the era.\\" Peirce's criterion was discussed in William Chauvenet's book. Applications An application for Peirce's criterion is removing poor data points from observation pairs in order to perform a regression between the two observations (e.g., a linear regression). Peirce's criterion does not depend on observation data (only characteristics of the observation data), therefore making it a highly repeatable process that can be calculated independently of other processes. This feature makes Peirce's criterion for identifying outliers ideal in computer applications because it can be written as a call function. =Previous attempts= In 1855, B. A. Gould attempted to make Peirce's criterion easier to apply by creating tables of values representing values from Peirce's equations.Gould, B.A., \\"On Peirce's criterion for the rejection of doubtful observations, with tables for facilitating its application\\", Astronomical Journal, issue 83, vol. 4, no. 11, pp. 81‚Äì87, 1855. DOI: 10.1086/100480. A disconnect still exists between Gould's algorithm and the practical application of Peirce's criterion. In 2003, S. M. Ross (University of New Haven) re-presented Gould's algorithm (now called \\"Peirce's method\\") with a new example data set and work-through of the algorithm. This methodology still relies on using look-up tables, which have been updated in this work (Peirce's criterion table).Ross, S.M., \\"Peirce's criterion for the elimination of suspect experimental data\\", Journal of Engineering Technology, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 1‚Äì12, 2003. In 2008, an attempt to write a pseudo-code was made by a Danish geologist K. Thomsen.Thomsen, K., \\"Topic: Computing tables for use with Peirce's Criterion - in 1855 and 2008\\", The Math Forum @ Drexel, posted 5 October 2008. Accessed 15 July 2013. While this code provided some framework for Gould's algorithm, users were unsuccessful in calculating values reported by either Peirce or Gould. In 2012, C. Dardis released the R package \\"Peirce\\" with various methodologies (Peirce's criterion and the Chauvenet method) with comparisons of outlier removals. Dardis and fellow contributor Simon Muller successfully implemented Thomsen's pseudo-code into a function called \\"findx\\". The code is presented in the R implementation section below. References for the R package are available onlineC. Dardis, \\"Package: Peirce,\\" R-forge, accessed online: https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/Peirce/Peirce- manual.pdf?root=peirce as well as an unpublished review of the R package results.C. Dardis, \\"Peirce's criterion for the rejection of non-normal outliers; defining the range of applicability,\\" Journal of Statistical Software (unpublished). Available online: https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/Peirce/PeirceSub.pdf?root=peirce In 2013, a re-examination of Gould's algorithm and the utilisation of advanced Python programming modules (i.e., numpy and scipy) has made it possible to calculate the squared-error threshold values for identifying outliers. =Python implementation= In order to use Peirce's criterion, one must first understand the input and return values. Regression analysis (or the fitting of curves to data) results in residual errors (or the difference between the fitted curve and the observation points). Therefore, each observation point has a residual error associated with a fitted curve. By taking the square (i.e., residual error raised to the power of two), residual errors are expressed as positive values. If the squared error is too large (i.e., due to a poor observation) it can cause problems with the regression parameters (e.g., slope and intercept for a linear curve) retrieved from the curve fitting. It was Peirce's idea to statistically identify what constituted an error as \\"too large\\" and therefore being identified as an \\"outlier\\" which could be removed from the observations to improve the fit between the observations and a curve. K. Thomsen identified that three parameters were needed to perform the calculation: the number of observation pairs (N), the number of outliers to be removed (n), and the number of regression parameters (e.g., coefficients) used in the curve-fitting to get the residuals (m). The end result of this process is to calculate a threshold value (of squared error) whereby observations with a squared error smaller than this threshold should be kept and observations with a squared error larger than this value should be removed (i.e., as an outlier). Because Peirce's criterion does not take observations, fitting parameters, or residual errors as an input, the output must be re-associated with the data. Taking the average of all the squared errors (i.e., the mean-squared error) and multiplying it by the threshold squared error (i.e., the output of this function) will result in the data-specific threshold value used to identify outliers. The following Python code returns x-squared values for a given N (first column) and n (top row) in Table 1 (m = 1) and Table 2 (m = 2) of Gould 1855. Due to the Newton-method of iteration, look-up tables, such as N versus log Q (Table III in Gould, 1855) and x versus log R (Table III in Peirce, 1852 and Table IV in Gould, 1855) are no longer necessary.

Dardis and S. Muller in 2012 which returns the maximum error deviation, x. To complement the Python code presented in the previous section, the R equivalent of \\"peirce_dev\\" is also presented here which returns the squared maximum error deviation, x^2. These two functions return equivalent values by either squaring the returned value from the \\"findx\\" function or by taking the square-root of the value returned by the \\"peirce_dev\\" function. Differences occur with error handling. For example, the \\"findx\\" function returns NaNs for invalid data while \\"peirce_dev\\" returns 0 (which allows for computations to continue without additional NA value handling). Also, the \\"findx\\" function does not support any error handling when the number of potential outliers increases towards the number of observations (throws missing value error and NaN warning). Just as with the Python version, the squared-error (i.e., x^2) returned by the \\"peirce_dev\\" function must be multiplied by the mean-squared error of the model fit to get the squared-delta value (i.e., Œî2). Use Œî2 to compare the squared-error values of the model fit. Any observation pairs with a squared-error greater than Œî2 are considered outliers and can be removed from the model.

Cyrus Gates was a cartographer and map maker for New York State, as well as an abolitionist. The great granddaughter of Cyrus-Louise Gates-Gunsalus has stated that from 1848 until the end of slavery in the United States in 1865, the Cyrus Gates Farmstead was a station or stop on the Underground Railroad (Woodward 1973). Its owners, Cyrus and Arabella Gates, were outspoken abolitionists as well as active and vital members of their community. Historian Shirley L. Woodward states that through those years escaped slaves came through the Gates' station. One runaway female slave, a 16-year-old girl named Margaret \\"Marge\\" Cruizer was so comfortable with the Gates family that she decided to stay at their station and live with them. Marge ended up spending the rest of her life with the Gates' and is buried in the cemetery next to the house. (Woodward 1973 pp 52‚Äì53). Margaret was also known as the wife of Thomas \\"Old Bay Tom\\" Crocker. Mr. Crocker was famous for being the first African-American to be elected as mayor of Binghamton, New York, albeit a protest vote that was reversed in the election of 1872. (Smith 2014). Role of the Farmstead Owning a station or being a conductor on the Underground Railroad (UGRR) was most certainly illegal behavior, although not considered unethical behavior by many people. In light of this, participation in the Underground Railroad was very secretive; records were not usually, if ever kept of the comings and goings at stations. It would be an unwise act to record illegal behavior, especially in New York where the Northern Democrats were strong. In fact Cyrus' own brother William Gates was an ardent Copperhead and after an argument with Cyrus over \\"breaking the law\\" moved out of the family house. In light of this it is easier to see why much of the history of this vast network of stations has been passed down through oral history. The oral history of the Cyrus Gates Farmstead says that the main house was used before and after the Civil War as a station on the Underground Railway and that Cyrus and Arabella Gates were station hosts or conductors. The following is a statement made by Cyrus Gates' great-granddaughter, Louise Gates-Gunsalus (1894-1982): \\"I know of only one route in Maine township for the travel and care of slaves. This route has, as far as I have been told, its first point of contact in a home in Vestal, New York. Its next station, or stop, the Luce home on Route 26, south of Union Center, and next, to the Russell Gates home. The next and last known point was the Bushnell home on the Newark Valley, Dryden Road at the crossroad where the Bushnell house stood. From there the next station was in or near Ithaca, but where I have no information.\\" (Woodward 1973 p. 52) As UGRR historian Milton Sernett has referenced: To facilitate the harboring and if necessary the hiding of runaway slaves, the Gates' built a hiding place inside the south wing of their attic. Inside the master bedroom upstairs, an access panel was made inside of one of the closets. The old leather thong used to close the panel to the wall is still there to this day. This panel would give assess to an area that was roughly 20 feet by 10 feet by four feet high. It is not known if runaways were actually ever forced to retreat to this area. There would probably have to be a high level of concern, such as a bounty hunter in the area to necessitate the hiding of slaves inside the house. (Sernett 2002, p162) Underground Railroad Connection The Southern Tier of New York State was a key geographic area for runaway slaves, whether on their own or as a part of the Underground Railroad (UGRR). Broome County, New York stands midway between a Philadelphia UGRR launch point such as William Still's and the significant UGRR station zone of abolitionist Gerrit Smith in Peterboro, NY. As the most well known of UGRR conductors, Harriet Tubman frequently traveled this area. She made several trips from the South to Upstate New York stations such as Smith's and possibly the Gates', St. James AME Zion Church (Ithaca, New York), and eventually to final stops in places like St. Catharines, Ontario. In addition, Harriet Tubman lived in Auburn, New York where as a member of the Thompson AME Zion Church she started the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged. Slaves traveled from the South to the North from station to station mostly under the cover of darkness. Often, once runaways got into the states of Pennsylvania and Ohio, they were not in much danger of being captured by bounty hunters or the police. Runaways in New York often worked and did chores with the station owners during the day. In 1850 the United States government, in trying to prevent a war between the slave and non-slave states, passed the new and more aggressive Fugitive Slave Act. This law gave bounty hunters from the South more rights to chase slaves into the North and forced Northern police officers into arresting and returning runaway slaves that they captured. Abolitionists hated the Fugitive Slave Act, and started working with more intensity and urgency to find ways to end slavery. Southern slave plantation owners hated Northern abolitionists because the abolitionists wanted to end slavery which in turn would mean that the plantation owners would lose their laborers, considered as their chattel. The average slave was worth a lot of money to a slave owner-about $1,000 in the 1860s, so owners would pay bounty hunters to bring runaway slaves back to them or pay upon delivery of the runaway slave. Historic Registry The Cyrus Gates Farmstead was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In addition to the main Greek Revival farmhouse, the farmstead contains two barns (one built in 1836), a tenant farmer's house, a bee keeper's house or sugar shack, a blacksmith's shop, a four-seat outhouse, and a pole barn. The placement was based on the home's Greek Revival architecture, the importance of Cyrus Gates, a cartographer and mapmaker for the State of New York and its strong oral history as a stop on the Underground Railroad.

Activated on 29 Apr 2008, the Spaatz Center is named in honor of the Air Force's first Chief of Staff, General Carl A. Spaatz. The Spaatz Center was disestablished in 2017. ;Squadron Officer School The Squadron Officer School (SOS) in-residence program is a 6.5-week course for USAF captains. The course is structured around four primary areas (1) leadership, (2) building highly-effective teams, (3) logical and ethical reasoning in decision making, and (4) multi-domain joint warfare. Squadron Officer School emblem ;Air Command and Staff College Air Command And Staff College emblem Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) is a 10-month master's level resident program that prepares field grade USAF, U.S. Army and USMC officers in pay grade O-4 and USN / USCG officers in pay grade O-4, their international counterparts, and U.S. civilian equivalents, for positions of higher responsibility within the military and other government agencies. Often referred to as \\"Intermediate Level Education\\" (ILE), Intermediate Level Professional Military Education (Intermediate Level PME) or Phase I Joint PME, ACSC is also available via \\"distance learning,\\" primarily a CD-ROM enabled correspondence course. ;Air War College Air War College emblem Air War College (AWC) is a 10-month resident course for USAF, U.S. Army and USMC Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels (pay grades O-5 and O-6), USN and USCG Commanders and Captains (pay grade O-5 and O-6), their international counterparts, and Department of Defense and Department of the Air Force civilian equivalents (GS-14/GM-14, GS-15/GM-15). AWC prepares students to lead in a joint, interagency and multi-national environment at the strategic level of military operations. Also known as \\"Senior Developmental Education\\" (SDE), Senior Level PME, or (since 2010) Phase II JPME, AWC is also available at the Pentagon and selected active USAF installations as a 10-month seminar program paralleling the academic year and course content of the resident course. It is also available via \\"distance learning\\" as a correspondence course typically requiring 18 to 24 months to complete. The Secretary of the Air Force's annual National Security Forum (NSF) conducted for select influential civilian leaders in business, industry, state and local government, law, academia, media, and the clergy is administered and hosted by the AWC. ;International Officer School The International Officer School (IOS) is a seven-week course designed to provide international officers an enhanced understanding of the United States and prepares them for attending Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and/or the Air War College. =Enlisted Professional Military Education= College for Enlisted Professional Military Education emblem The Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education (Barnes Center, formerly the College for Enlisted Professional Military Education) is responsible for the instructional programs and faculty development for all Air Force enlisted professional military education programs. This includes the Airman Leadership Schools, Noncommissioned Officer Academies and the Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy. ;Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy The Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy graduates more than 1,800 Air Force chief master sergeant selectees, senior master sergeants, senior master sergeant selectees, and non-commissioned officers and chief petty officers from other U.S. military services and the services of international U.S.-Allied nations annually. It is located on Maxwell AFB's Gunter Annex. ;NCO Academies The NCO Academies provide selected noncommissioned officers education. Several NCO Academies operate worldwide on various Air Force installations. ;Airman Leadership School The goal of the program is to provide senior airmen an opportunity to understand more fully their position in the USAF organizational structure and the continued need for professional development to be effective NCOs. ;First Sergeant Academy ;Enlisted Heritage Research Institute The Enlisted Heritage Research Institute is dedicated to preserving the history of the enlisted corps of the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army Aeronautical Division, Air Service, Air Corps and Air Forces in the development of air power to defend the United States. The Institute achieves this by featuring artifacts, collections, and pictorial exhibits, written and oral documentation, audiovisuals, equipment, and selected aircraft parts. Additionally, students use the in-house and on-line research capabilities to enhance learning and complete enlisted heritage research projects. =Officer Accessions= Air Force ROTC emblem Officer Training School emblem The Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center), previously known as Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS), operates two of the four USAF officer commissioning sources. These are the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) at civilian colleges and universities across the United States, and the Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) at Maxwell AFB. Although they are USAF officer accession and training programs, the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and the Air National Guard's Academy of Military Science (AMS) do not fall under the Air University. The U.S. Air Force Academy is a Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), and the Superintendent of the USAF Academy reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Admission to and administration of the ANG Academy of Military Science, although collocated with OTS at Maxwell AFB, is controlled by the Director of the Air National Guard via the National Guard Bureau (NGB). =Citizenship Development, Aerospace Education, and Associated Programs= Junior ROTC emblem Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps The Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) program provides citizenship training and air and space science education via a cadet program for high school students in grades 9 through 12 at various high schools across the United States and at select Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) at US military installations overseas. Instruction is conducted by retired field grade USAF officers employed by the respective school systems, assisted by retired USAF senior non-commissioned officers under similar employment. AFJROTC is a \\"citizenship program\\" for high school students and should not be confused with AFROTC, which is a \\"pre-commissioning program\\" for 4-year college and university students to become Air Force officers.Civil Air Patrol emblem =Academic education= Air Force Institute of Technology emblem The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) is a geographically separated unit (GSU) of Air University, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) is the only degree-granting institution of higher learning in the world dedicated exclusively to enlisted military personnel. CCAF offers educational opportunities for active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve airmen and NCOs to earn a job-related, two-year undergraduate associate of applied science degree. CCAF also facilitates selected professional certification and recognition for airmen. Possession of a CCAF degree has in recent years become a de facto mandatory requirement for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant and higher, regardless of whether or not the candidate has a civilian degree such as a baccalaureate. This de facto status is now official: starting with the 2007 promotion cycle, promotion candidates cannot receive critical endorsements on performance reports without having first received an associate degree from CCAF. =Professional continuing education= 100px The Curtis E. LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education (LeMay Center), previously known as the Air Force Doctrine Development and Education Center, develops and publishes Air Force doctrine, teaches doctrine through resident and on-line courses, and advocates air power through visionary war gaming, and provides Integration and outreach services for Air University. The Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Development provides continuing education and technical training to Air Force and other Department of Defense personnel and international officers, including resident and distance-learning courses for a variety of Air Force specialties. =United States Air Force Center for Strategic Deterrence Studies= The USAF Counterproliferation Center (CPC) was established in 1998 at the direction of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Located at Maxwell AFB, this Center capitalizes on the resident expertise of Air University, while extending its reach far beyond - and influences a wide audience of leaders and policy makers. A memorandum of agreement between the Air Staff's Director for Nuclear and Counterproliferation (then AF/XON) and Air War College commandant established the initial personnel and responsibilities of the Center. This included integrating counterproliferation awareness into the curriculum and ongoing research at the Air University; establishing an information repository to promote research on counterproliferation and nonproliferation issues; and directing research on the various topics associated with counterproliferation and nonproliferation . In 2008, the Secretary of Defense's Task Force on Nuclear Weapons Management recommended \\"Air Force personnel connected to the nuclear mission be required to take a professional military education (PME) course on national, defense, and Air Force concepts for deterrence and defense.\\" This led to the addition of three teaching positions to the CPC in 2011 to enhance nuclear PME efforts. At the same time, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, in coordination with the AF/A10 and Air Force Global Strike Command, established a series of courses at Kirtland AFB to provide professional continuing education (PCE) through the careers of those Air Force personnel working in or supporting the nuclear enterprise. This mission was transferred to the CPC in 2012, broadening its mandate to providing education and research on not just countering WMD but also nuclear operations issues. In April 2016, the nuclear PCE courses were transferred from the Air War College to the U.S. Air Force Institute for Technology. In February 2014, the Center's name was changed to the Center for Unconventional Weapons Studies (CUWS) to reflect its broad coverage of unconventional weapons issues, both offensive and defensive, across the six joint operating concepts (deterrence operations, cooperative security, major combat operations, irregular warfare, stability operations, and homeland security). The term \\"unconventional weapons\\", currently defined as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, also includes the improvised use of chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. In May 2018, the name changed again to the Center for Strategic Deterrence Studies (CSDS) in recognition of senior Air Force interest in focusing on this vital national security topic. The Center's military insignia displays the symbols of nuclear, biological, and chemical hazards. The arrows above the hazards represent the four aspects of counterproliferation - counterforce, active defense, passive defense, and consequence management. The Latin inscription \\"Armis Bella Venenis Geri\\" stands for \\"weapons of war involving poisons.\\" =Advanced Professional Military Education= The School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS) is the \\"Air Force graduate school for airpower and space power strategists\\". The school began as the School of Advanced Airpower Studies. It began operation on July 22, 1991, at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.West 1991. p. 10. The first class of 25 students was all-male, although later classes included women. Most of the first class came from the U.S. Air Force's Air Command and Staff College. The first director of the school, Colonel William F. Fortner, stated that the school's goal was to \\"create the soldier-scholars for conflicts of the future\\". Fortner likened the school to the U.S. Army's School of Advanced Military Studies, but stated that the new school's curriculum would go \\"much deeper into the study of air-power history, doctrine and strategy\\". The curriculum, planned for a duration of 11 months, was taught by a faculty of nine civilian and military Ph.D instructors.West 1991. p. 10, 16. The curriculum in the first years comprised two parts, focusing on \\"the past and present of warfare\\". Students read about 150 pages per night, and wrote and defended a research paper. Associated Agencies =Air Force Historical Research Agency= 100px The Air Force Historical Research Agency is the repository for United States Air Force historical documents. The Agency's collection, begun during World War II in Washington, DC, moved in 1949 to Maxwell Air Force Base, the site of the present-day Air University, to provide research facilities for professional military education students, the faculty, visiting scholars, and the general public.

Units and various main operating bases and auxiliary airfields were established throughout an area of central Florida designated as a mock \\"war theater\\" and stretching roughly from Tampa through Orlando, east to Titusville, north to Starke, and northwest to Apalachicola in which air war games were conducted. Following the end of World War II, the simulation facility ceased operation and most of the operating air bases and auxiliary airfields were either placed in military caretaker status or returned to local civilian control. On 1 Jun 1945, the AAFSAT was redesignated as the Army Air Forces School (AAFS). On 29 Nov 1945, the AAFS relocated from Orlando AAB, Florida to Maxwell Field, Alabama. =Operations= The Wright Brothers established the first U.S. civilian flying school in Montgomery, Alabama in 1910. By the 1920s, Montgomery became an important link in the growing system of aerial mail service. It was in the early 1930s when the Army Air Corps Tactical School moved to Maxwell Field and Montgomery became the country's intellectual center for airpower education. Air University (AU), established in 1946, continues the proud tradition of educating tomorrow's planners and leaders in air and space power for both the U.S. Air Force as well as other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, federal government civilians and many international organizations. Today, AU has a reach worldwide affecting the careers of every member of the United States Air Force. Origins As a result of the US Army Reorganization Act of 1920, the Air Service authorized the establishment of an Air Service School on 10 February 1921 at Langley Field, Virginia. To reflect its primary mission of preparing senior officers for higher Air Service duty, the Air Service redesignated the Air Service School as the Air Service Field Officers' School. Following the decision to let all Air Service officers attend the institution in 1922, the Air Service redesignated the Air Service Field Officers' School as the Air Service Tactical School. In conjunction with the 1926 redesignation of the Army Air Service as the Army Air Corps, the Air Service Tactical School became the Air Corps Tactical School. To take advantage of the propitious climate and facilities expansion potential, the Army Air Corps began moving the Air Corps Tactical School from Langley Field in Virginia in 1931 to Maxwell Field, Alabama. World War II Because of the wartime need for officers of the caliber of those attending the Maxwell institution, in May 1941 the Army Air Corps suspended instruction at the tactical school and reduced its faculty and staff to seven officers. Anticipating the institution's eventual reopening, the Army Air Corps moved the skeletonized Air Corps Tactical School to Washington, DC, and placed it under the Directorate of Individual Training. In spite of the institution's successful efforts in developing Air Corps planners and leaders, the Air Corps discontinued the Air Corps Tactical School on 9 October 1942 with the intention of reopening it after the war. To partially fill the educational void left by the discontinuance of the Tactical School and to correct the growing shortage of experienced Air Corps, later renamed Army Air Forces, officers, the Army Air Forces authorized the establishment of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics on 9 Oct 42. The Army Air Forces activated the AAF School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, with the mission to train \\"selected officers\\" under simulated combat conditions. Based on lessons learned in the combat theaters and the school's actual operational experiences, the AAF established the AAF Tactical Center with the AAF School of Applied Tactics as a subordinate unit. Due to a major reorganization of the Tactical Center and a change in the types of courses conducted by the institution, the Army Air Forces redesignated the AAF School of Applied Tactics as the Army Air Forces School on 1 Jun 45. Postwar era In preparation for its post-war educational operations, the Army Air Forces transferred the Army Air Forces School from Orlando AAB to Maxwell Field, Alabama on 29 November 1945 and assigned it directly to Headquarters, U.S. Army Air Forces (HQ AAF) as a major command. In the first conclave of its kind since the end of World War II, the AAF Educational Conference ended after a three-day meeting on 20 Feb 1945 to discuss the post-war AAF educational structure. The Army Air Forces began the first instructor training course in March 1946 for preparing instructors to teach at the post-war AAF educational institutions. HQ AAF redesignated the Army Air Forces School as Air University (AU) on 12 March 1946 and established the Air War College, Air Command and Staff School, and Air Tactical School as its subordinate units. The AU commander organized the Air University Board of Visitors, composed of senior educators and university administrators, to meet regularly and advise him on educational matters. Air University became operational on 1 April 1946 when HQ AAF transferred the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas, from Air Training Command to Air University. To take advantage of existing facilities, Air University transferred the Air Tactical School from Maxwell Field to Tyndall Field, Florida on 21 May 1946. Major General Orvil A. Anderson was appointed the first commandant of the Air War College, the senior school in the three-tiered AAF officer professional military education (PME) system. Assuming responsibilities comparable to those of the Army and Navy advisers on the HQ AU staff, the Royal Air Force Liaison Officer also became a part of the HQ AU staff on 1 June 1946. When members of the Air University Board of Visitors concluded their first meeting with such dignitaries as General Carl Spaatz, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces; Air Marshall Hugh Pughe Lloyd of the Royal Air Force; and the class members of the Air War College and the Air Command and Staff School participating, the Air University was officially dedicated during a ceremony at Maxwell Field. Classes began at the Air War College and the Air Command and Staff School on 4 September 1946, fulfilling the \\"dream for education in airpower\\" of most post-war AAF leaders and planners. The Air Tactical School, the junior officer PME program of the AU educational system, began classes at Tyndall in January 1947. Later that year, the Royal Canadian Air Force sent its first group of students to the two-week indoctrination course at Maxwell. With Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson as the guest speaker, the Air War College and the Air Command and Staff School conducted a combined graduation ceremony for 185 senior and field grade officers. As a result of the National Security Act of 1947, the United States Air Force became a separate and independent branch of the U.S. military on 18 September 1947. In keeping with the Air Force's new status, Headquarters, U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF) redesignated Maxwell Field as Maxwell Air Force Base on 13 January 1948. On 12 July 1949, HQ USAF established the Air University Human Resources Research Institute. It was one of three USAF field agencies created to conduct research on the human factor in Air Force planning and operations. Air University established the 3894th AU School Squadron to provide administrative support to Air Force instructors and students at the various service schools operated by the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The USAF Historical Division relocated to Maxwell AFB from Washington, DC in September 1949 and became a part of the Air University Library. The combined activity is now known as the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA). Recognition The Air University, is accredited by the Commission of Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and is authorized to grant the following degrees: Master of Strategic Studies ‚Äì offered by the Air War College Master of Military Operational Art and Science ‚Äì offered by the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) Master of Aerospace Studies ‚Äì offered by the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS) Master of Science in Flight Test Engineering ‚Äì offered by the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAFTPS) 2017 Air University Airman of the Year - Senior Airman Damian Nicholas Feliciano (AFIT) Associate in Applied Science ‚Äì offered for USAF enlisted personnel by the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) with majors in 68 areas In 2010, SACS upgraded AU's accreditation to Level V, a move that will eventually enable AU to eventually award three different doctoral degrees. Air University was also awarded the Space Foundation's inaugural Space Achievement award in 1995. This award recognizes individuals or organizations for space achievement, breakthrough space technology or program or product success representing critical milestones in the evolution of space exploration and development.

The game was the biggest success for its publisher, Magnetic Images. The player was free to roam around the desert and town at will constrained only by the need to make sure they had enough food to eat and a safe place to sleep. Earning money could be accomplished in a variety of ways including panning for gold in a river, mining for gold in a cave, or capturing a wanted bandit. Food could be purchased or caught from a river if the player had previously acquired fishing gear. The game became well known for its breezy, free-flowing nature. The game was also notable for not having a single environment for the player to operate in; the location of mines and rivers, and the details of characters a player could meet were different each time the game was played.  Reception  Abandonware website Abandonias Ted Striker reviewed Lost Dutchman Mine with \\"There are different different modes that the game will put you in, which are equally basic and so fun (something basic is something fun says I).

Tuna casserole is a common dish in some parts of the United States, prepared using only nonperishable pantry ingredients. History Casseroles became popular in American households in the 1950s mainly because the ingredients were cheap and easy to find at the supermarket. A can of tuna, a can of vegetables, a can of soup, and a package of egg noodles becomes a prepared family dinner in around half an hour. Tuna casserole can also be frozen or refrigerated and then reheated to be eaten the next day. Tuna casserole is popular to take to potlucks. In small communities, it may be taken to the home of someone who is sick or going through bereavement as a gesture of kindness. While there are countless variations on tuna casserole, historically it is made with egg noodles, chopped onion, shredded cheddar cheese, frozen green peas, canned and drained tuna, condensed cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup, sliced mushrooms and crushed potato chips. The cooked noodles, onion, cheese, peas, tuna, soup and mushrooms are mixed in a baking dish, with the potato chips and more cheese sprinkled on top, and then baked. Tuna mornay Also common in most parts of Australia this casserole is also called tuna mornay and served with a Mornay sauce (B√©chamel with cheese added, or cheese sauce).

The Champion of the league competed for the All-Ontario Championship and the Clarence Schmalz Cup. In the summer of 2016, the GMOHL merged into the Provincial Junior Hockey League and became the Carruthers Division in the Northern Conference. History Map of GMOHL, GBJCHL, and MOJCHL teams, red are current, blue are defunct. Dating back to the late 1940s, the Georgian Bay League featured teams like the Owen Sound Greys, Barrie Colts, and Collingwood Blues. As the top tier teams of the group were promoted to Junior B, teams to the north entered the loop in the 1960s - Powassan North Stars, Bracebridge Bears, Huntsville Blair McCann, Parry Sound Shamrocks, Gravenhurst Indians, and so on. In 1971, the South-Central Junior D Hockey League was formed with teams like the Bradford Blues, Alliston Hornets, Schomberg Cougars, and Stayner Siskins. The South-Central League became Central League Group 1 in 1973. In 1974, Powassan and the Sundridge Beavers dropped out of the Georgian Bay League, so Huntsville and Bracebridge joined the Central League for two seasons until 1977 when they found enough interest from other clubs to restart their League. During this time, the Central League had three playoff championships, Central Junior C, Georgian Bay Junior C, and Central Junior D, all representing the league at the provincial level. When the South-Central Junior D league was promoted to Junior C, their league champion competed for the Clarence Schmalz Cup, but a second tier champion also competed for the Junior D OHA Cup. In 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, the Stayner Siskins competed on behalf of the then Central league for the All- Ontario Junior D title, victorious in 1974 and 1976. The Georgian Mid-Ontario Junior \\"C\\" Hockey League is the result of the 1994 merger of the Mid-Ontario Junior \\"C\\" Hockey League and the short-lived Georgian Junior \\"C\\" Hockey League. The league began as a Junior \\"D\\" league in the early 1970s. During the 2004-05 season, the GMOHL played an interlocking schedule with the Western Junior C Hockey League. The GMOHL won the series with 44 victories, 32 losses, and 6 ties. In, May 2010, The OHA confirmed the welcoming of The Caledon Golden Hawks have entered the GMOHL. In March 2012, the GMOHL allowed the Huntsville Otters to join the league after recently retracting from the Ontario Junior Hockey League. With the announcement on April 16, 2015 the league accepted the Collingwood Admirals as the eleventh franchise to the Georgian Bay Mid-Ontario Hockey League.http://www.simcoe.com/news- story/5562188-collingwood-admirals-granted-new-junior-c-franchise/ The awarding of the Collingwood franchise was challenged by the Stayner Siskins on the basis that the area did not have enough hockey players to support another franchise. Their appeal was upheld and the expansion Admirals will not participate. The Fergus Devil's announced that they are taking a leave of absence for the 2015-16 season.

RSerPool is an IETF standard, which has been developed by the IETF RSerPool Working Group and documented in RFC 5351, RFC 5352, RFC 5353, RFC 5354, RFC 5355 and RFC 5356.  Introduction  In the terminology of RSerPool a server is denoted as a Pool Element (PE). In its Pool, it is identified by its Pool Element Identifier (PE ID), a 32-bit number. The PE ID is randomly chosen upon a PE's registration to its pool. The set of all pools is denoted as the Handlespace. In older literature, it may be denoted as Namespace. This denomination has been dropped in order to avoid confusion with the Domain Name System (DNS). Each pool in a handlespace is identified by a unique Pool Handle (PH), which is represented by an arbitrary byte vector. Usually, this is an ASCII or Unicode name of the pool, e.g. \\"DownloadPool\\" or \\"WebServerPool\\". Each handlespace has a certain scope (e.g. an organization or company), denoted as Operation Scope. It is explicitly not a goal of RSerPool to manage the global Internet's pools within a single handlespace. Due to the localisation of Operation Scopes, it is possible to keep the handlespace \\"flat\\". That is, PHs do not have any hierarchy in contrast to the Domain Name System with its top-level and sub-domains. This constraint results in a significant simplification of handlespace management. Within an operation scope, the handlespace is managed by redundant Pool Registrars (PR), also denoted as ENRP servers or Name Servers (NS). PRs have to be redundant in order to avoid a PR to become a Single Point of Failure (SPoF). Each PR of an operation scope is identified by its Registrar ID (PR ID), which is a 32-bit random number. It is not necessary to ensure uniqueness of PR IDs. A PR contains a complete copy of the operation scope's handlespace. PRs of an operation scope synchronize their view of the handlespace using the Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP). Older versions of this protocol use the term Endpoint Namespace Redundancy Protocol; this naming has been replaced to avoid confusion with DNS, but the abbreviation has been kept. Due to handlespace synchronization by ENRP, PRs of an operation scope are functionally equal. That is, if any of the PRs fails, each other PR is able to seamlessly replace it. Using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), a PE can add itself to a pool or remove it from by requesting a registration or deregistration from an arbitrary PR of the operation scope. In case of successful registration, the PR chosen for registration becomes the PE's Home- PR (PR-H). A PR-H not only informs the other PRs of the operation scope about the registration or deregistration of its PEs, it also monitors the availability of its PEs by ASAP Keep-Alive messages. A keep-alive message by a PR-H has to be acknowledged by the PE within a certain time interval. If the PE fails to answer within a certain timeout, it is assumed to be dead and immediately removed from the handlespace. Furthermore, a PE is expected to re- register regularly. At a re-registration, it is also possible for the PE to change its list of transport addresses or its policy information. To use the service of a pool, a client ‚Äî called Pool User (PU) in RSerPool terminology ‚Äî first has to request the resolution of the pool's PH to a list of PE identities at an arbitrary PR of the operation scope. This selection procedure is denoted as Handle Resolution. For the case that the requested pool is existing, the PR will select a list of PE identities according to the pool's Pool Member Selection Policy, also simply denoted as Pool Policy. Possible pool policies are e.g. a random selection (Random) or the least-loaded PE (Least Used). While in the first case it is not necessary to have any selection information (PEs are selected randomly), it is required to maintain up-to-date load information in the second case of selecting the least-loaded PE. Using an appropriate selection policy, it is e.g. possible to equally distribute the request load onto the pool's PEs. After reception of a list of PE identities from a PR, a PU will write the PE information into its local cache. This cache is denoted as PU-side Cache. Out of its cache, the PU will select exactly one PE ‚Äî again using the pool's selection policy ‚Äî and establish a connection to it using the application's protocol, e.g. HTTP over SCTP or TCP in case of a web server. Using this connection, the service provided by the server is used. For the case that the establishment of the connection fails or the connection is aborted during service usage, a new PE can be selected by repeating the described selection procedure. If the information in the PU-side cache is not outdated, a PE identity may be directly selected from cache, skipping the effort of asking a PR for handle resolution. After re-establishing a connection with a new PE, the state of the application session has to be re-instantiated on the new PE. The procedure necessary for session resumption is denoted as Failover Procedure and is of course application-specific. For an FTP download for example, the failover procedure could mean to tell the new FTP server the file name and the last received data position. By that, the FTP server will be able to resume the download session. Since the failover procedure is highly application- dependent, it is not part of RSerPool itself, though RSerPool provides far reaching support for the implementation of arbitrary failover schemes by its Session Layer mechanisms. To make it possible for RSerPool components to configure automatically, PRs can announce themselves via UDP over IP multicast. These announces can be received by PEs, PUs and other PRs, allowing them to learn the list of PRs currently available in the operation scope. The advantage of using IP multicast instead of broadcast is that this mechanism will also work over routers (e.g. LANs inter-connected via a VPN) and the announces will ‚Äî for the case of e.g. a switched Ethernet ‚Äî only be heard and processed by stations actually interested in this information. For the case that IP multicast is not available, it is of course possible to statically configure PR addresses.

It primarily serves as the home of the Columbus Clippers of the International League, the Triple-A minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians since 2009. Groundbreaking for the ballpark took place on August 2, 2007, with construction being completed in April 2009. Designed by 360 Architecture and developed by Nationwide Realty Investors, the 10,100-seat stadium is part of a $70 million project. The stadium is at the corner of Neil Avenue and Nationwide Boulevard in the Arena District of Columbus and replaced the Clippers' former home, Cooper Stadium. In February 2006, the naming rights for the park were purchased by Huntington Bancshares Inc. for $12 million over 23 years. On April 18, 2009, the park opened to the public, with the Columbus Clippers playing the Toledo Mud Hens in the stadium's first game. On August 12, 2009, Huntington Park was named the Ballpark of the Year by Baseballparks.com, beating out all other new or significantly renovated baseball stadiums in the country, including such Major League parks as the new Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. The award is given to the new stadium with the \\"best combination of superior design, attractive site selection and fan amenities.\\" The ballpark's attendance record was set on July 26, 2010 when 12,517 fans saw the Clippers defeat the Pawtucket Red Sox, 11‚Äì7. The coldest game played in the history of the stadium saw Clippers take on the Pawtucket Red Sox on April 16, 2018, amidst snow flurries and 35 degree weather. The ballpark was built adjacent to the old Ohio Penitentiary site. Construction issues The selection of the construction firms to build the ballpark was a contentious issue. On November 5, 2007, Lithko Contracting of Hamilton filed suit against Franklin County. At issue was the fact that the contract for pouring concrete was awarded to Baker Construction despite Lithko's bid coming in $17,500 lower. It was alleged that the Franklin County Commissioners had favored Baker over Lithko because Baker employed union labor and Lithko did not. Because the Commissioners did not want to face delays due to a lawsuit, they awarded the contract to Lithko on November 9, 2007. The county was subsequently sued two more times by firms after they were denied the contracts despite being low bidders. In those cases, the county rejected the low bid due to allegations of \\"prevailing wage\\" violations by the low bidders. State Representative Larry Wolpert (R-23) had asked the state controlling board not to release $7 million in funds until the low bidders were selected. Features The ballpark includes 32 suites, 42 loge boxes, and 650 club seats. The Left Field Building includes a 110-foot bar with six open patios overlooking the field on the second story. The third story is The AEP Power Pavilion, an open air rooftop with bleachers reminiscent of Wrigley Field. The Picnic Terrace in left field will offer fans a place to relax and take in a ballgame 325 feet down the line. The Wendy's Hamburger Balconies in right field overlook a 22-foot wall that is only 318 feet down the line. Other uses The park hosted the 2009, 2011, and 2012 Big Ten Conference Baseball Tournaments. The park has also hosted the OHSAA High School Baseball state championship games since its opening in 2009. The stadium hosted both the Triple-A All-Star Game and the Triple-A National Championship Game in 2018. =Concerts= On June 22, 2010 Huntington Park held its first major concert.

In sports, agility is often defined in terms of an individual sport, due to it being an integration of many components each used differently (specific to all of sorts of different sports). Sheppard and Young (2006) defined agility as a \\"rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus\\". Agility is also an important attribute in many role playing games, both video games such as Pok√©mon, and tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons.

The Independence Park (Parque da Independ√™ncia), where supposedly the Emperor Pedro I of Brazil proclaimed the independence of Brazil, the Paulista Museum, which exhibits classic architecture and a collection of Brazilian colonial artifacts, and the Museum of Zoology of the University of S√£o Paulo, are also located in Ipiranga. The Ipiranga Brook is perhaps one of the most famous Brazilian brooks, because it is mentioned in the first line of the Brazilian National Anthem. The region near the Tamanduate√≠ River had industrial characteristics, to the point where buses and trams heading there had the destination labeled \\"Factory\\". The area next to Nazar√© Avenue, in contrast, is filled with mansions of wealthy families and a number of colleges, like Unesp and S√£o Camilo, and workers of the factory's houses. The commercial center of Ipiranga concentrates on Silva Bueno Street. There are banks, clothes stores and grocery stores like the famous Chocol√¢ndia. In 2007, this neighborhood was served with the installation of a new metro whose station is named Alto do Ipiranga. It is located at Gentil de Moura Street and connects passengers with the green line of S√£o Paulo Metro.

History Lakefield Chiefs player during 2014 Schmalz Cup Final. In 1970, the Suburban Junior C Hockey League divided into two leagues. Most of the westerly teams formed the Mid-Ontario Junior B Hockey League, while most of the easterly teams formed the Central Lakeshore Junior C League. In 1972, the Eastern Junior B Hockey League was also divided up, half to the Metro Junior B Hockey League and the other half to the Central League. With this, the Eastern Junior C Loop became the Quinte-St. Lawrence Junior C Hockey League, the Central League's main territorial rival until 1986. In 1986, the Quinte-St. Lawrence League folded. The Wellington Dukes fled to the Central League and the Gananoque Islanders joined the Ottawa District Hockey Association's Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League. With a plethora of major towns in the league: Trenton, Ajax, Bowmanville, Port Hope, Lindsay, Cobourg, and the retirement community-backed Wellington Dukes; the Central Junior B Hockey League absorbed many of these franchises over the course of a couple years in their run to Junior A status‚Äîobtained in 1993. Since losing half of their teams, the Central Ontario League has survived with the likes of Georgina, Lakefield, Little Britain, Port Perry, and Uxbridge. A sixth team has failed to stick in most cases, in towns like Bobcaygeon and Madoc. Due to retraction in the Ontario Junior Hockey League, the Bowmanville Eagles have returned in 2011 in the form of the Clarington Eagles but Ajax remains unserviced after their team left Junior A, both having folded in 2010. Following the 2015-16 seasons the Central Ontario Junior C Hockey League amalgamated with the other southern Ontario junior \\"C\\" hockey leagues and became a division within the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, General Sobolev was the main proponent of the strand of Russian foreign and military policy that saw for the Russians a duty to expel the Ottoman Empire from Europe and to take the Bosphorus for Russia in order to ensure full access to the Mediterranean Sea. Recognising that the United Kingdom maintained a policy of preventing this Sobolev advocated mobilising forces near Afghanistan and British India in order to distract British attention from the Ottomans and give a Russia a free hand in that region.Martin Sicker, The Islamic World in Decline: From the Treaty of Karlowitz to the Disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p. 159-160 Sobolev was one of two young Russian generals appointed to the Bulgarian cabinet in April 1882 by Alexander. Sobolev was appointed both Prime Minister of Bulgaria and Minister of the Interior, with his fellow Russian general Aleksandr Kaulbars as Minister of War.R. J. Crampton, Bulgaria, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 110 Sobolev awarded the other cabinet posts to members of the Conservative Party and won their favour by endorsing laws to reduce the size of the National Assembly of Bulgaria and limit the franchise to educated property owners, measures that ensured the Liberals were all but eliminated. Sobolev however irked his Bulgarian allies when he dismissed the state as \\"just another Khanate\\", comparing it to the Khanate of Bukhara where he had been governor. He further annoyed the newly elected Conservative Assembly members with his aristocratic manner and his over-the-top attempts to bribe them, which even included leaving confectionery on each member's desk.Crampton, Bulgaria, p. 111 Soon Sobolev was at loggerheads with the Assembly over the presence of a force of Russian Dragoons in Bulgaria and over ownership of the railways. Eventually, with the aid of pro-Russian Orthodox leader Metropolitan Mileti of Sofia, Sobolev forced the resignation of his nemesis Konstantin Stoilov, the Minister for Foreign and Religious Affairs, although Stoilov's departure prompted two other leading Conservatives to also quit the cabinet.Crampton, Bulgaria, pp. 111-112 With the government in ruins Sobolev turned to the Liberal leader Dragan Tsankov for a new coalition but he had another agenda in mind. Tsankov won the support of both Alexander and the assembly for a constitutional restoration after convincing all parties that Russian influence had become too strong.

It was created by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL). The main purpose of this law was to create one way to go about making an arbitration in the United States law. The law is currently preempted in almost all contexts by the 1925 FAA. This arbitration act was drafted as a model arbitration statute to allow each U.S. state to adopt a uniform law of arbitration, instead of having each state enact a unique arbitration statute. The act was updated by the Uniform Law Commission in the year 2000. The new act, called the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, or RUAA, has been adopted by eighteen states. Thirty-five states have adopted some version of the Uniform Arbitration Act.  Details  Section 1 includes the ruling on a written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. (Gibbons,Marten,Sumners,Witte. pg.2) Section 2 requires the court to compel arbitration when there is an arbitration agreement and one party refuses to arbitrate.' In making the determination whether to compel arbitration, the court is limited to deciding whether an agreement to arbitrate exists, whether the dispute involved is within the scope of the agreement and whether the right to arbitrate was waived. The court is not free to examine the merits of the controversy.' (Gibbons,Marten,Sumners,Witte. pg.16) There are more sections included in this act that are not fully listed. In order to find the rest of these acts you can view an image of the actual Uniform Arbitration Act and there you will see the following sections as well as a more detailed description as to what each section entails specifically. This Act has come in to some controversy since its adoption in 2000, and this has to do with the freedom of the states to develop their own version of the Act. So while the Act is meant to make a uniform method of arbitration, it differs slightly depending on which state you visit or reside in.

Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years. Most members of Generation Z are the children of Generation X and sometimes millennials. Despite being dubbed \\"digital natives,\\" members of Generation Z are not necessarily digitally literate. Compared to previous generations, members of Generation Z in some developed nations tend to be well-behaved, abstemious, and risk-averse. They tend to live more slowly than their predecessors when they were their age. They have lower rates of teenage pregnancies, and they consume drugs and alcohol less often. They are more concerned about academic performance and job prospects. They have a tendency to be more flexible in workplaces. In general, they are better at delaying gratification than their counterparts from the 1960s, despite concerns to the contrary. But they are more prone to mental health problems, and may be facing declining cognitive abilities, especially among the cognitive elites. Terminology and etymology An early use of the term Generation Z was in the 1994 book Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie by Hunter S. Thompson: \\"Generation X got off easy compared to the hideous fate of the poor bastards in Generation Z. They will be like steerage passengers on the Titanic, trapped in the watery bowels of a sinking 'unsinkable ship.'\\" Other proposed names for the generation include iGeneration, Gen Tech, Gen Wii, Homeland Generation, Net Gen, Digital Natives, Neo-Digital Natives, Plurals, Internet Generation, Post-Millennials, and Zoomers. The Pew Research Center surveyed the various names for this cohort on Google Trends in 2019 and found that in the U.S., the term \\"Generation Z\\" was the most popular by far, so much so that the Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries both have official entries for it. Multiple people claimed to have coined the term iGeneration (or iGen). Rapper MC Lars is credited with using the term as early as 2003. Demographer Cheryl Russell claims to have first used the term in 2009. Psychology professor and author Jean Twenge claims that the name iGen \\"just popped into her head\\" while she was driving near Silicon Valley, and that she had intended to use it as the title of her 2006 book Generation Me about the Millennial generation, until it was overridden by her publisher. Statistics Canada has noted that the cohort is sometimes referred to as the Internet Generation, as it is the first generation to have been born after the popularization of the Internet. In Japan, the cohort is described as Neo-Digital Natives, a step beyond the previous cohort described as Digital Natives. Digital Natives primarily communicate by text or voice, while neo-digital natives use video, video-telephony, and movies. This emphasizes the shift from PC to mobile and text to video among the neo-digital population. According to Dictionary.com's Slang Dictionary, \\"Zoomer\\" is an informal term used to refer to members of Generation Z. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term \\"Zoomer\\" is rising in popular usage, but was still not widely used enough to justify a dictionary entry as of January 2020. Previously, it was used to describe handheld personal computers or personal digital assistants (in the 1990s) and particularly active Baby Boomers (in the 2000s). Zoomer, in its current incarnation, skyrocketed in popularity in 2018, when it was used in a 4chan Internet meme mocking Gen Z adolescents via a Wojak caricature dubbed a \\"Zoomer\\" (a pun on the term \\"boomer\\"). The term \\"zoomer\\" is modeled on \\"boomer\\" and is often used in an ironic, humorous, or mocking tone. Date and age range definition Oxford Living Dictionaries describes Generation Z as \\"the generation reaching adulthood in the second decade of the 21st century.\\" The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines Generation Z as generation of people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Australia's McCrindle Research Centre defines Generation Z as those born between 1995 and 2009, starting with a recorded rise in birth rates, and fitting their newer definition of a generational span with a maximum of 15 years.Generations Defined . Mark McCrindle The Irish Times defines Generation Z as \\"people born between 1995 and 2010.\\" Psychologist Jean Twenge defines Generation Z as those born 1995‚Äì2012. Randstad Canada describes Generation Z as those born between 1995 and 2014. BBC has described the cohort as anyone born after about 1995. Ipsos MORI states that their official definition of Gen Z is anyone born from 1996. According to UPI, Generation Z starts in 1995. Business Insider describes the cohort as born between 1996 and 2010, but refers to Pew Research Center's definition. The Pew Research Center defines Generation Z as people born from 1997 onward, choosing this date for \\"different formative experiences,\\" such as new technological developments and socioeconomic trends, including the widespread availability of wireless internet access and high-bandwidth cellular service, and key world events, including the September 11th terrorist attacks. Members of Gen Z were no older than four years of age at the time of the attacks, and consequently had little to no memory of the event. Pew has stated that they have not set a definition for the endpoint of Gen Z, but they did use 1997 to 2012 to define Gen Z for an analysis in 2019. According to this definition, as of the oldest member of Generation Z is years old, and the youngest will turn this year. News outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and the Harvard Business Review describe Generation Z as people born since 1997, and The New York Times, PBS, and Reuters define Generation Z as people born after 1996. Bloomberg News describes Gen Z as those born between 1997 and 2012, as does the Brookings Institution. In a 2018 report, the American Psychological Association describes Generation Z as \\"those between the ages of 15 and 21\\" at the time. In Japan, generations are defined by a ten-year span with \\"Neo-Digital Natives\\" beginning after 1996. Statistics Canada defines Generation Z as starting in 1993. They do not recognize a traditional Millennials cohort and instead have Generation Z directly follow what they designate as Children of Baby Boomers. In a minority viewpoint, author Neil Howe, co-creator of the Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory, defines the Homeland Generation as those born 2005 onwards, but states that the \\"2005 date remains tentative,\\" saying \\"You can't be sure where history will someday draw a cohort dividing line until a generation fully comes of age.\\"  Arts and culture  According to a 2020 Childwise report based on interviews with 2,200 British children between the ages of five and sixteen, young people today are highly dependent on their mobile phones. Most now get their first device at the age of seven. By the age of eleven, having a cell phone became almost universal. Among those aged seven to sixteen, the average time spent on the phone each day is three and a third hours. 57% said they went to bed with their phones beside them and 44% told the interviewers they felt \\"uncomfortable\\" in the absence of their phones. Due to the nature of this technology‚Äîcell phones are personal and private devices‚Äîit can be difficult for parents to monitor their children's activities and shield them from inappropriate contents. Both the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Great Recession have greatly influenced the attitudes of this generation in the United States. However, unlike the Millennials, Generation Z typically have little to no memory of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since the oldest members were not yet cognizant when the 9/11 attacks occurred (or had not yet been born at that time), there is no generational memory of a time the United States has not been at war with the loosely defined forces of global terrorism. Psychologist Anthony Turner suggests it is likely that both events have resulted in a feeling of unsettlement and insecurity among the people of Generation Z with the environment in which they were being raised. The economic recession of 2008 is particularly important to historical events that have shaped Generation Z, due to the ways in which their childhoods may have been affected by the recession's financial stresses felt by their parents. A 2013 survey by Ameritrade found that 47% in the United States (considered here to be those between the ages of 14 and 23) were concerned about student debt, while 36% were worried about being able to afford a college education at all. This generation is faced with a growing income gap and a shrinking middle-class, which all have led to increasing stress levels in families. According to Public Relations Society of America, the Great Recession has taught Generation Z to be independent, and has led to an entrepreneurial desire, after seeing their parents and older siblings struggle in the workforce. A 2014 study Generation Z Goes to College found that Generation Z students self-identify as being loyal, compassionate, thoughtful, open-minded, responsible, and determined. How they see their Generation Z peers is quite different from their own self-identity. They view their peers as competitive, spontaneous, adventuresome, and curious‚Äîall characteristics that they do not see readily in themselves. In 2016, the Varkey Foundation and Populus conducted an international study examining the attitudes of over 20,000 people aged 15 to 21 in twenty countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They found that most important personal values to these people were helping their families and themselves get ahead in life (both 27%), followed by honesty (26%). Looking beyond their local communities came last at 6%. Familial values were especially strong in South America (34%) while individualism and the entrepreneurial spirit proved popular in Africa (37%). People who influenced youths the most were parents (89%), friends (79%), and teachers (70%). Celebrities (30%) and politicians (17%) came last. In general, young men were more likely to be influenced by athletes and politicians than young women, who preferred books and fictional characters. Celebrity culture was especially influential in China (60%) and Nigeria (71%) and particularly irrelevant in Argentina and Turkey (both 19%). For young people, the most important factors for their current or future careers were the possibility of honing their skills (24%), and income (23%) while the most unimportant factors were fame (3%) and whether or not the organization they worked for made a positive impact on the world (13%). The most important factors for young people when thinking about their futures were their families (47%) and their health (21%); the welfare of world at large (4%) and their local communities (1%) bottomed the list.right The Economist has described Generation Z as a more educated, well-behaved, stressed and depressed generation in comparison to previous ones. In September 2018, Jean Twenge saw smartphones and social media as raising an unhappy, compliant \\"iGen\\", which she described as the generation born after 1995. Mental depression has been said to be more common among Generation Z than any previous generation, with increased technological and online dependence and decreased face to face interaction as a key cause. According to the aforementioned study by the Varkey Foundation, youths were overall happy with the states of affairs in their personal lives (59%). The most unhappy young people were from South Korea (29%) and Japan (28%) while the happiest hailed from Indonesia (90%) and Nigeria (78%) (see right). In order to determine the overall 'happiness score' for each country, researchers subtracted the percentage of people who said they were unhappy from that of those who said they were happy. The most important sources of happiness were being physically and mentally healthy (94%), having a good relationship with one's family (92%), and one's friends (91%). In general, respondents who were younger and male tended to be happier. Religious faith came in last at 44%. Nevertheless, it was a major source of happiness for youths from Indonesia (93%), Nigeria (86%), Turkey (71%), China and Brazil (both 70%). Top reasons for anxiety and stress were money (51%) and school (46%); social media and having access of basic resources (such as food and water) finished the list, both at 10%. Concerns over food and water were most serious in China (19%), India (16%), and Indonesia (16%); young Indians were also more likely than average to report stress due to social media (19%). London is considered one of the best places to live for Generation Z.A 2019 study conducted by the online rental platform Nestpick considered 110 cities worldwide with regards to factors they believed were important to Generation Z, such as social equality, multiculturalism, and digitization, and found that overall, London, Stockholm, Los Angeles, Toronto, and New York City topped the list. However, the rankings changed with respect to each of the categories considered. Oslo, Bergen (both in Norway), Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm√∂ (all from Sweden) were champions of gender equality, yet Seoul, London, Boston, Stockholm, and Los Angeles best met the digital wants of Generation Z. However, given that members of Generation Z tend to be financially pragmatic, all the aforementioned cities shared a common disadvantage: high costs of living. Therefore, the Nestpick index for Generation Z could change in the upcoming years as these people grow older and have different priorities. Urban researcher Richard Florida and his team found, using U.S. Census data between 2005 and 2017, an increase in employment across the board for members of the \\"creative class\\" ‚Äì people in education, healthcare, law, the arts, technology, science, and business, not all of whom have a university degree ‚Äì in virtually all U.S. metropolitan areas with a population of a million or more. Indeed, the total number of the creative class grew from 44 million in 2005 to over 56 million in 2017. Florida suggested that this could be a \\"tipping point\\" in which talents head to places with a high quality of life yet lower costs of living than well-established creative centers, such as New York City and Los Angeles, what he called the \\"superstar cities.\\" According to Girls Gen Z Digital media company Sweety High's 2018 Gen Z Music Consumption & Spending Report, Spotify ranked first for music listening among Gen Z, terrestrial radio ranked second, while YouTube was reported to be the preferred platform for music discovery. Using artificial intelligence, Joan Serra and his team at the Spanish National Research Council studied the massive Million Song Dataset and found that between 1955 and 2010, popular music has gotten louder, while the chords, melodies, and types of sounds used have become increasingly homogenized. Indeed, producers seem to be engaging in a \\"Loudness War,\\" with the intention of attracting more and more audience members. Old hits are re- recorded with simpler chord progression and increased loudness using different instruments to sound new and fashionable. While the music industry has long been accused of producing songs that are louder and blander, this is the first time the quality of songs is comprehensively studied and measured.  Cognitive abilities  A 2010 meta-analysis by an international team of mental health experts found that the worldwide prevalence of intellectual disability (ID) or mental retardation was around one percent. But the share of individuals with such a condition in low- to middle-income countries were up to twice as high as their wealthier counterparts because they lacked the sources needed to tackle the problem, such as preventing children from being born with ID due to hereditary conditions with antenatal genetic screening, poor child and maternal care facilities, and inadequate nutrition, leading to, for instance, iodine deficiency. The researchers also found that ID was more common among children and adolescents than adults. In 2013, a team of neuroscientists from the University College London published a paper on their neurodevelopmental disorders can affect a child's educational outcome. They found that up to 10% of the human population suffer from specific learning disabilities, or about two to three children in a (Western) classroom. Such conditions include dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder. They are caused by abnormal brain development due to complicated environmental and genetic factors. A child may suffer from multiple learning disorders at the same time. For example, among children with ADHD, 33-45% also suffer from dyslexia and 11% from dyscalculia. Normal or high levels of intelligence offer no protection. Each child has a unique cognitive and genetic profile and would benefit from a flexible education system. Some authors consider that some of their competencies, such as reading competence, are being transformed due to their familiarity with digital devices, platforms and texts. A 2020 report by psychologist John Protzko analyzed over 30 studies and found that children have become better at delaying gratification over the previous 50 years, corresponding to an average increase of 0.18 standard deviations per decade on the IQ scale. This is contrary to opinion the majority of the 260 cognitive experts polled (84%), who thought this ability was deteriorating. Researchers test this ability using the Marshmallow Test. Children are offered treats. If they are willing to wait, they get two. If not, they only get one. The ability to delay gratification is associated with positive life outcomes, such as better academic performance, lower rates of substance abuse, and healthier body weights. Possible reasons for improvements in the delaying gratification include higher standards of living, better-educated parents, improved nutrition, higher preschool attendance rates, more test awareness, and environmental or genetic changes. This development does not mean that children from the early twentieth century were worse at delaying gratification and those from late twenty-first will be better at it, however. Moreover, some other cognitive abilities, such as simple reaction time, color acuity, working memory, complexity of vocabulary usage, and three-dimensional visuospatial reasoning have shown signs of secular decline. In a 2018 paper, cognitive scientists James R. Flynn and Michael Shayer argued that the observed gains in IQ during the twentieth century‚Äîcommonly known as the Flynn effect‚Äîhad either stagnated or reversed, as can been seen from a combination of IQ and Piagetian tests. In the Nordic nations, there was a clear decline in general intelligence starting in the 1990s, an average of 6.85 IQ points if projected over 30 years. In Australia and France, the data remained ambiguous; more research was needed. In the United Kingdom, young children suffered a decline in the ability to perceive weight and heaviness, with heavy losses among top scorers. In the German-speaking countries, young people saw a fall in spatial reasoning ability but an increase in verbal reasoning skills. In the Netherlands, preschoolers and perhaps schoolchildren stagnated (but seniors gained) in cognitive skills. What this means is that people were gradually moving away from abstraction to concrete thought. On the other hand, the United States continued its historic march towards higher IQ, a rate of 0.38 per decade, at least up until 2014. South Korea saw its IQ scores growing at twice the average U.S. rate. The secular decline of cognitive abilities observed in many developed countries might be caused by diminishing marginal returns due to industrialization and to intellectually stimulating environments for preschoolers, the cultural shifts that led to frequent use of electronic devices, the fall in cognitively demanding tasks in the job market in contrast to the twentieth century, and possibly dysgenic fertility. While U.S. IQ scores continued to increase, creativity scores, as measured by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, were in decline between the 1990s and late 2000s. Educational psychologist Kyung Hee Kim reached this conclusion after analyzing data samples of kindergartens to high-school students and adults in 1974, 1984, 1990, and 2008, a grand total of 272,599 individuals. Previously, U.S. educational success was attributed to the encouragement of creative thinking, something education reformers in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan sought to replicate. But U.S. educators decided to go in the opposite direction, emphasizing standardization and test scores at the expense of creativity. On the parenting side, given children little play time and letting them spend large amounts of time in front of a screen likely contributed to the trend. Creativity has real-life consequences not just in the arts but also in academia and in life outcomes.  Demographics  center = Africa = Statistical projections from the United Nations in 2019 suggest that, by 2020, the people of Niger would have a median age of 15.2, Mali 16.3, Chad 16.6, Somalia, Uganda, and Angola all 16.7, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 17.0, Burundi 17.3, Mozambique and Zambia both 17.6. (This means that more than half of their populations were born in the first two decades of the twenty-first century.) These are the world's youngest countries by median age. While a booming population can induce substantial economic growth, if healthcare, education, and economic needs were not met, there would be chronic youth unemployment, low productivity, and social unrest. Investing in human capital is crucial in the formation of a productive society. = Asia = alt= China's fertility rate dropped from 5.91 children per woman in 1967 to 1.6 in 2012. The one-child policy is a factor behind this development. According to the Chinese Central Government, the one-child policy prevented approximately 400 million births. Experts continue to debate this figure, however. Some argue that such a drop in fertility is typical for a rapidly industrializing country while others believe it actually accelerates the aging process. According to demographer Zhen Binwen of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China's labor force would peak in 2015. Almost 7% of China's population were 65 years or older in 2000, a benchmark after which the United Nations considers a population to be aging. China is in fact aging quite quickly. UN figures show that China's ratio of people aged 60 and over increased 3.8% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the global average of 3% between 1950 and 2010. Therefore, China is one of the developing countries with aging populations. The nation's quickly growing and export-driven economy will slow down, as the advantage of abundant and cheap labor fades away. Life expectancy in China rose from 43 in 1960 to 73 in 2010, thanks to improved standards of living, better nutrition, and access to healthcare and education. As a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender imbalances in China and India. According to the United Nations, in 2018, there were 112 Chinese males aged 15 to 29 for every hundred females in that age group. That number in India was 111. China had a total of 34 million excess males and India 37 million, more than the entire population of Malaysia. Together, China and India had a combined 50 million of excess males under the age of 20. Such a discrepancy fuels loneliness epidemics, human trafficking (from elsewhere in Asia, such as Cambodia and Vietnam), and prostitution, among other societal problems. Like the European Union (and unlike the United States), Japan has a declining population. Coupled with an exceptionally long life expectancy (85 years for women and 78 for men, as of 2005) and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, this means that by 2050, 30% of Japanese will be over the age of 60. While the government has been introducing various incentives for people to have more children, no return on investment could be expected till the 2030s, when the children born in the early 2000s enter the workforce. (Immigration is politically unpopular in this country.) According to official figures, the number of individuals below 15 years of age in Japan was 13.6% of the population in 2007 and was predicted to fall to 12.3% in 2015, or about half that of the elderly. 2007 was the twenty-sixth consecutive year in which the number of people under the age of 15 dropped in Japan. Japan's birth rate fell from roughly replacement level, 2.1, in the early 1970s to 1.26 in 2005. Government officials estimated that population of Japan would decrease 30% by the 2050s, from 127 million to below 90 million. Singapore's birth rate has fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 since the 1980s before stabilizing during the 2000s and 2010s. (It reached 1.14 in 2018, making it the lowest since 2010 and one of the lowest in the world.) Government incentives such as the baby bonus have proven insufficient to raise the birth rate. Singapore's experience mirrors those of Japan and South Korea. In Taiwan, the average reported ideal family size among women aged 18 to 24 dropped from 2.1 in 1991 to 1.8 in 2003. In Hong Kong, that among women aged 18 to 27 fell from 1.8 in 1991 to 1.5 in 2011. File:Population pyramid of India 2016.png File:Population pyramid of Japan 2016.png File:Population pyramid of Singapore 2016.png = Europe = European countries by proportions of people aged 65 and over between 2008 and 2018 From about 1750 to 1950, Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to having low birth and death rates. By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \\"correction,\\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist Gary Becker argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the second demographic transition.) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s had leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility that cemented itself in subsequent demographic cohorts. Member states of the European Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed. By the early 2000s, the average reported ideal family size among German-speaking countries has fallen to 1.7, well below the replacement level. Low levels of interest in reproduction is more pronounced among the economically advantaged, in contrast to earlier times, when wealth was correlated with fertility. At the same time, France and Scandinavia retained high fertility rates compared to other developed countries, especially Southern Europe and East Asia. At first sight, it appears that this might be due to their socially progressive values and policies, i.e. making it easier for women to pursue both their careers and reproductive dreams. However, closer scrutiny suggests the argument that \\"feminism is the new pro-natalism\\" is untenable, given that there are socially progressive countries with low fertility rates such as Austria and Canada on one hand, and more conservative and traditionalist countries with high fertility rates such as Ireland and the United States on the other. alt= At the start of the twenty-first century, Europe has a population aging at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that by 2050, 40% of Europeans will be over the age of 60. This problem is especially acute in the East whereas in the West, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses. In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Researches by the demographers and political scientists Eric Kaufmann, Roger Eatwell, and Matthew Goodwin suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of nationalist populist revolts against the political establishment across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which being the Brexit Referendum in 2016. Italy is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad ‚Äì 150,000 did in 2018 ‚Äì and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. One solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash. Greece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere. This brain drain and a rapidly aging population could spell disaster for the country. Russia has a falling birth rate and a declining population despite having an improving economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to the United Nations, Russia's population could fall by as much as one third by 2050. Russian government statisticians estimated in 2005 that a boy born in their country that year has a slim chance of seeing his 60th birthday due to various lifestyle-related problems (such as alcoholism). A gap in life expectancy between the West and Russia started becoming noticeable in the 1960s. Russia's population dropped 6% between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. In the United Kingdom, even though the completed fertility rate changed little, the average age at first birth was increasing during the early 2000s. According to the Royal College of Midwives, this was the main reason why the proportion of births requiring labor inductions or Cesarean sections increased from 31% to 50%. Between 1990 and 2019, Iceland saw its population grew by 40.7%, Norway by 25.9%, Sweden by 20.0%, Denmark 13.1%, Greenland 0.8%, Finland 10.9%, the Faroe Islands 7.5%, and the √Öland Islands 22.9%. File:Population pyramid of France 2016.png File:Population pyramid of Greece 2016.png File:Population pyramid of Russia 2016.png = North America = Data from Statistics Canada published in 2017 showed that Generation Z comprised 17.6% of the Canadian population. According to Statistics Canada, between 1980 and 2009, the frequency of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) dropped from one per a thousand live births to 0.3, a 71% reduction. Data from the United Nations shows that the mortality rate of newborns between 28 and 364 days of age plummeted 64% and that of toddlers below the age of five fell 9.7% between 1980 and 2015. According to Statistics Canada, the number of households with both grandparents and grandchildren remained rare but has been growing. In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in early twenty-first century cannot (or think they cannot) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggle to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Between grandparents and parents, potential sources of friction include the diets of the children, their sleep schedule, how to discipline them, and how they may use electronic gadgets. Parents today are more reliant on the Internet for information than their own parents, and many even recommend that they take grandparenting classes. Because Millennials and members of Generation X tend to have fewer children than their parents the Baby Boomers, each child typically receives more attention his or her grandparents and parents compared to previous generations. In the United States, at the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (also known as the Hart-Celler Act), which abolished national quotas for immigrants and replaced it with a system that admits a fixed number of persons per year based in qualities such as skills and the need for refuge. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most immigrants to the United States had come from Europe, but by the late 1990s and early 2000s, Asia and Latin America became the top sources of immigrants to the nation. A report by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution stated that in the United States, the Millennials are a bridge between the largely Caucasian pre- Millennials (Generation X and their predecessors) and the more diverse post- Millennials (Generation Z and their successors). Indeed, in spite of the diminished flow of immigrants to the United States following the Great Recession, Generation Z is the most ethnically diverse yet seen. 52% of this generation is white. 25% is Hispanic. 14% is black, and 4% is Asian. Approximately 4% is multiracial, and this number has risen rapidly between 2000 and 2010. More specifically, the number of Americans who identify as mixed white and black has grown by 134% and those of both white and Asian extraction by 87%. For comparison, 44% of Millennials, 40% of Generation X, and 28% of the Baby Boomers identify as non-white. Frey's research also suggests that at the national level, Hispanics and Asians are the fastest growing racial minority groups in the United States while the number of Caucasians under the age of 18 has been declining since 2000. This demographic change could have social, cultural, and political implications for the decades ahead. Members of Generation Z are slightly less likely to be foreign born than Millennials; the fact that more American Latinos were born in the U.S. rather than abroad plays a role in making the first wave of Generation Z appear better educated than their predecessors. However, researchers warn that this trend could be altered by changing immigration patterns and the younger members of Generation Z choosing alternate educational paths. As a demographic cohort, Generation Z is smaller than the Baby Boomers and their children, the Millennials. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Generation Z makes up about one quarter of the U.S. population, as of 2015. Provisional data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that U.S. fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 since 1971. (It was 1.765 in 2017.) The fertility rate of Mexico, once among the highest in the world, was approximately at replacement level in 2010, down from almost seven in 1960. This is due to government birth control policies dating back to the 1970s that made heavy use of sterilization in a country with stringent abortion restrictions except in the capital. By the 2000s, about 40% of married Mexican women were sterilized. Women's increased participation in the workforce and improved educational opportunities also played a role in this development. Although the number of new Mexicans each year in the 2000s was the same as those from the 1970s, the rate of growth has slowed substantially. Mexicans' average age was 28 in 2010, up from 17 in 1980. For comparison, Europe took a century rather than 30 years to make the same demographic transition. Mexicans living in the United States had a higher fertility rate than their counterparts in the old country, however, and this means that the number of people of Mexican heritage would continue to grow North of the border. In fact, in the early 2000s, there was significant Mexican migration, legal and otherwise, into the United States, where standards of living and wages are higher. File:Population pyramid of Canada 2016.png File:Population pyramid of the United States 2016.png File:Population pyramid of Mexico 2016.png = Oceania = alt= Australia's total fertility rate has fallen from above three in the post-war era, to about replacement level (2.1) in the 1970s to below that in the late 2010s. (It was 1.74 in 2017.) However, immigration has been offsetting the effects of a declining birthrate. In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 2.5% from China, 2.2% from India, and 1.1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025. However, the ratio of people of working age to retirees (the dependency ratio) has gone from eight in the 1970s to about four in the 2010s. It could drop to two by the 2060s, depending in immigration levels. \\"The older the population is, the more people are on welfare benefits, we need more health care, and there's a smaller base to pay the taxes,\\" Ian Harper of the Melbourne Business School told ABC News (Australia). While the government has scaled back plans to increase the retirement age, to cut pensions, and to raise taxes due to public opposition, demographic pressures continue to mount as the buffering effects of immigration are fading away. Australians coming of age in the early twenty- first century are more reluctant to have children compared to their predecessors due to economic reasons: higher student debt, expensive housing, and negative income growth.  Education  =Global trends= In 2019, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) surveyed educational standards and achievement of its 36 member states and found that while education spending has gone up by an average of 15% over the previous decade, academic performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) has largely stagnated. Students from China and Singapore, both outside of the OECD, continued to outclass their global peers. Among all the countries that sent their students to take the PISA, only Albania, Colombia, Macao, Moldova, Peru, Portugal, and Qatar saw any improvements since joining. Of these, only Portugal is an OECD country. Meanwhile, Australia, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, and South Korea all saw a decline in overall performance since joining. Funding, while important, is not necessarily the most important thing, as the case of Estonia demonstrates. Estonia spent 30% below the OECD average yet still achieved top marks. Socioeconomic background is a key factor in academic success in the OECD, with students coming from families in the top 10% of the income distribution being three years ahead in reading skills compared to those from the bottom 10%. However, the link between background and performance was weakest in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Japan, Norway, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, meaning these countries have the most equitable education systems. For information on public support for higher education (for domestic students) in various countries in 2019, see chart below. center = In continental Europe = In Sweden, universities are tuition-free, as is the case in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland. However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite widespread concern over rising student debt, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008‚Äì9 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a government agency known as the Centrala Studiest√∂dsn√§mnden (CSN), which include low- interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008‚Äì9 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter. In 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \\"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of ‚Ç¨8,500 as of 2005. Opponents believed fees would make it more difficult for people to study and graduate on time. Germany also suffered from a brain drain, as many bright researchers moved abroad while relatively few international students were interested in coming to Germany. This has led to the decline of German research institutions. A sample JAPD certificate. In France, while year-long mandatory military service for men was abolished in 1996 by President Jacques Chirac, who wanted to build a professional all- volunteer military, all citizens between 17 and 25 years of age must still participate in the Defense and Citizenship Day (JAPD), when they are introduced to the French Armed Forces, and take language tests. In 2019, President Emmanuel Macron introduced something similar to mandatory military service, but for teenagers, as promised during his presidential campaign. Known as the Service National Universel or SNU, it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the tricolor, and sing the national anthem. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how navigating with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much. The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad. A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian. At the same time, returning to conscription was also popular; supporters included 90% of the UMP party, 89% of the National Front (now the National Rally), 71% of the Socialist Party, and 67% of people aged 18 to 24. This poll was conducted after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. = In English-speaking countries = Students at the University of Mary Lumen Vitae University Center, 2017 In 2017, almost half of Britons have received higher education by the age of 30. This is despite the fact that ¬£9,000 worth of student fees were introduced in 2012. U.K. universities first introduced fees in autumn 1998 to address financial troubles and the fact that universities elsewhere charged tuition. Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons earning a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Blair did not take into account the historical reality that an oversupply of young people with high levels of education precipitated periods of political instability and unrest in various societies, from early modern Western Europe and late Tokugawa Japan to the Soviet Union, modern Iran, and the United States. Quantitative historian Peter Turchin termed this elite overproduction. Nevertheless, demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high- skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There was, however, a widening gender gap. As of 2017, women were more likely to attend or have attended university than men, 55% to 43%, a 12% gap. By the late 2010s, education has become Australia's fourth largest exports, after coal, iron ore, and natural gas. For Australia, foreign students are highly lucrative, bringing AU$9 billion into the Australian economy in 2018. That amount was also just over a quarter of the revenue stream for Australian universities. In 2019, Australian institutions of higher education welcomed 440,000 foreign students, who took up about 30% of all seats. 40% of non-Australian students hailed from China. In response to a surge in interest from prospective foreign students, Australian universities have invested lavishly in research laboratories, learning facilities, and art collections. Some senior bureaucrats saw their salaries rise tremendously. But the topic of international students is a contentious one in Australia. Proponents of accepting high numbers of foreign students said this was because the Australian government was not providing sufficient funding, forcing schools to take in more from other countries. Critics argued universities have made themselves too dependent on foreign revenue streams. In 2020, as SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, international travel restrictions were imposed, preventing foreign students from going to university in Australia, where the academic year begins in January. This proved to be a serious blow to the higher-education industry in Australia because it is more dependent on foreign students than its counterparts in other English-speaking countries. Australia's federal government excluded universities AU$60bn wage-subsidy scheme because it wanted to focus on domestic students, who, it said, will continue to receive funding. Federal and state governments were likely to provide relief to small regional institutions, but, like the big universities, they might need to shrink in order to survive. In 2013, less than a third of American public schools had access to broadband Internet service, according to the non-profit EducationSuperHighway. By 2019, however, that number reached 99%, which has increased the frequency of digital learning. Students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2019). According to a 2015 Northeastern University Survey, 81% of Generation Z in the U.S. believes obtaining a college degree is necessary in achieving career goals. As Generation Z enters high school, and they start preparing for college, a primary concern is paying for a college education without acquiring debt. Students report working hard in high school in hopes of earning scholarships and the hope that parents will pay the college costs not covered by scholarships. Students also report interest in ROTC programs as a means of covering college costs. According to NeaToday, a publication by the National Education Association, two thirds of Gen Zers entering college are concerned about affording college. One third plan to rely on grants and scholarships and one quarter hope that their parents will cover the bulk of college costs. While the cost of attending college is incredibly high for most Gen Zers, according to NeaToday, 65% say the benefits of graduating college exceed the costs. As of 2019, the total college debt has exceeded $1.5 trillion, and two out of three college graduates are saddled with debt. The average borrower owes $37,000, up $10,000 from ten years before. A 2019 survey by TD Ameritrade found that over 30% of Generation Z (and 18% of Millennials) said they have considered taking a gap year between high school and college. Generation Z is revolutionizing the educational system in many aspects. Thanks in part to a rise in the popularity of entrepreneurship and advancements in technology, high schools and colleges across the globe are including entrepreneurship in their curriculum. According to the World Economic Forum, over one in five members of Generation Z are interested in attending a trade or technical school instead of a college or university. In the United States today, high school students are generally encouraged to attend college or university after graduation while the options of technical school and vocational training are often neglected. According to the 2018 CNBC All-American Economic Survey, only 40% of Americans believed that the financial cost of a four-year university degree is justified, down from 44% five years before. Moreover, only 50% believed a four-year program is the best kind of training, down from 60%, and the number of people who saw value in a two-year program jumped from 18% to 26%. These findings are consistent with other reports. Fine Hall, Princeton University. Members of Generation Z are anxious to pick majors that teach them marketable skills. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), some 88% consider job preparation to be the point of college. 39% are aiming for a career in medicine or healthcare, 20% in the natural sciences, 18% in biology or biotechnology, and 17% in business. A 2018 Gallup poll on over 32,000 university students randomly selected from 43 schools from across the United States found that just over half (53%) of them thought their chosen major would lead to gainful employment. STEM students expressed the highest confidence (62%) while those in the liberal arts were the least confident (40%). Just over one in three thought they would learn the skills and knowledge needed to become successful in the workplace. Because jobs (that matched what one studied) were so difficult to find in the few years following the Great Recession, the value of getting a liberal arts degree and studying the humanities at university came into question, their ability to develop a well-rounded and broad-minded individual notwithstanding. Moreover, institutions of higher education came under heightened skepticism in the 2010s due to high costs and disappointing results. People became increasingly concerned about debts and deficits. No longer were promises of educating \\"citizens of the world\\" or estimates of economic impact coming from abstruse calculations sufficient. Colleges and universities found it necessary to prove their worth by clarifying how much money from which industry and company funded research, and how much it would cost to attend. While the number of students majoring in the humanities have fallen significantly, those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, have risen sharply. Data from the Institute of International Education showed that compared to the 2013‚Äì14 academic year, the number of foreign students enrolling in American colleges and universities peaked in 2015‚Äì6, with about 300,000 students, before falling slightly in subsequent years. Compared to the 2017‚Äì18 academic year, 2018-19 saw a drop of 1% in the number of foreign students. This is a concern for institutions that have become reliant on international enrollment for revenue, as they typically charge foreign students more than their domestic counterparts. As of 2019, these were the first downturn in a decade. However, the number of foreign graduates staying for work or further training has increased. In 2019, there were 220,000 who were authorized to stay for temporary work, a 10% rise compared to fall 2017. Top sources of students studying abroad in the United States were China, South Korea, India, and Saudi Arabia (in that order). While the number of Chinese students on American soil has fallen noticeably‚Äîdue to a variety of factors, such as reported difficulty of obtaining a U.S. visa amid the ongoing Sino- American trade war, more competition from Canada and Australia, and growing anti-Chinese sentiments due to concerns over intellectual property theft‚Äîstudents coming from elsewhere in Asia (though not South Korea and Japan), Latin America, and Africa have gone up. In particular, the number of Nigerian students climbed 6% while those from Brazil and Bangladesh rose 10%. The most popular majors have shifted, with business, an academic subject extremely popular among Chinese students, falling by 7% in the 2018‚Äì19 academic year. Meanwhile, mathematics and computer science jumped 9%, replacing business as the second most popular majors after engineering. In 2019, there were over 4,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. However, Harvard business professor Clayton Christensen, known for creating the theory of \\"disruptive innovation\\" and applying it to a variety of industries, including education, predicted that half of all American colleges will go bankrupt within the next ten to fifteen years because of innovations in online learning. On the other hand, economist Michael Horn, also at Harvard, predicted in 2019 that 25% will close within the next 20 years. Rising administrative costs, sluggish middle-class wages, demographic decline (especially in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States), new forms of learning, stronger competition from better endowed universities, and higher demands for technical training undermine the financial viability of many schools. \\"It's going to be brutal across American higher education,\\" Horn told CBS News. A 2019 analysis by Moody's Investor Services estimated that about 20% of all small private liberal arts colleges in the United States were in serious financial trouble. Historically, this is not unprecedented; the 1970s and the 1980s saw drops in college enrollment, too. But increased enrollment by women halted the decline. Today, higher enrollment by first-generation students and Hispanics could do the same. Historically, university students were more likely to be male than female. The difference was especially great during the second half of the twentieth century, when enrollment rose dramatically compared to the 1940s. This trend continues into the very early twenty-first century. By the late 2010s, however, the situation has reversed. Women are now more likely to enroll in university than men. As a matter of fact, by the late 2010s, more than half of university students were women. In 2018, upwards of one third of each sex is a university student.  Employment prospects and economic trends  =Global developments= In 2018, as the number of robots at work continued to increase, the global unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, the lowest in 38 years. Current trends suggest that developments in artificial intelligence and robotics will not result in mass unemployment but can actually create high-skilled jobs. However, in order to take advantage of this situation, one needs a culture and an education system that promote lifelong learning. Honing skills that machines have not yet mastered, such as teamwork and effective communication, will be crucial. Parents of Generation Z might have the image of their child's first business being a lemonade stand or car wash. While these are great first businesses, Generation Z now has access to social media platforms, website builders, 3D printers, and drop shipping platforms which provides them with additional opportunities to start a business at a young age. The internet has provided a store front for Generation Z to sell their ideas to people around the world without ever leaving their house. As technological progress continues, something that is made evident by the emergence of or breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, three-dimensional printing, nanotechnology, quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, among other fields, culminating in what economist Klaus Schwab calls the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', the demand for innovative, well-educated, and highly skilled workers continues to rise, as do their incomes. Demand for low-pay and low-skilled workers, on the other hand, will continue to fall. By analyzing data from the United Nations and the Global Talent Competitive Index, KDM Engineering found that as of 2019, the top five countries for international high-skilled workers are Switzerland, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. Factors taken into account included the ability to attract high-skilled foreign workers, business- friendliness, regulatory environment, the quality of education, and the standard of living. Switzerland is best at retaining talents due to its excellent quality of life. Singapore is home to a world-class environment for entrepreneurs. And the United States offers the most opportunity for growth due to the sheer size of its economy and the quality of higher education and training. As of 2019, these are also some of the world's most competitive economies, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). In order to determine a country or territory's economic competitiveness, the WEF considers factors such as the trustworthiness of public institutions, the quality of infrastructure, macro-economic stability, the quality of healthcare, business dynamism, labor market efficiency, and innovation capacity. In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic not only created a health crisis but also triggered a severe economic downturn. While they are less likely to suffer from the novel pneumonia, many people born between the late 1990s and early 2000s now face rather dim economic prospects, as companies cut back on hiring, cancel internships, and fire their employees in order to stay in business. Low- skilled workers and those who just graduated are affected the most, but professionals who are able to work from home are spared. = Asia = Statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveal that between 2014 and 2019, Japan's unemployment rate went from about 4% to 2.4% and China's from almost 4.5% to 3.8%. These are some of the lowest rates among the top economies. When he came to power in 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong vowed to abolish capitalism and social classes. 'Old money' ceased to exist in China as a result of a centrally planned economy. But that changed in the 1980s when Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms; the middle and upper classes have blossoming ever since. In fact, he considered getting rich to be \\"glorious.\\" Chinese cities have morphed into major shopping centers. The number of billionaires (in U.S. dollars) in China is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, so much so that butler academies, whose students will serve the 'new rich', and finishing schools, whose students were born to rich parents, have been established. However, according to the World Bank, 27% of Chinese still live below the poverty line. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) promised to end poverty by 2020. CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign also cracks down on what he considered 'ostentatious displays of wealth'. Moreover, members of China's upper class must align themselves closely with the Communist Party. A number of young Chinese entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the Internet to become social media influencers to sell their products. Technology companies and startups are booming in China and Southeast Asia. Whereas in the past, Chinese firms copied the business strategies and models from their U.S. counterparts, now, they are developing their own approaches, and Southeast Asian companies are learning from their success and experience, a practice known as \\"Copy from China.\\" E-commerce has been flourishing. In Singapore, for example, not only is it now possible to place orders online, one may also purchase groceries in person, pay by mobile phone, and have them packed by machines; there are no cashiers. Whereas Westerners were first introduced to the Internet via their personal computers, people in China and Southeast Asia first got online with their mobile phones. Consequently, the e-commerce industry's heavy usage of mobile phone applications has paid off handsomely. In particular, Chinese entrepreneurs invest in what are known as \\"super-apps,\\" those that enable users to access all kinds of services within them, not just messaging, but also bike rentals and digital wallets. In Indonesia, relying on credit-card payments is difficult because the market penetration of this technology remains rather low (as of 2019). Nevertheless, e-commerce and ride-hailing are growing there, too. But it is Singapore that is the startup hub of the region, thanks to its excellent infrastructure, government support, and abundant capital. Furthermore, Singaporean technology firms are \\"uniquely positioned\\" to learn from both the U.S. and China. China's Generation Z has been taking advantage of the variety of lending options available to them, albeit at the cost of exceedingly high and possibly illegal interest rates. Although authorities have been cracking down on questionable money lenders, there is still a plethora of ways to borrow money. According to Bloomberg, China's household debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 27% in 2010 to 57% in 2019. For comparison, household debt was 126% of GDP in Australia, 99% in South Korea, and 75% in the United States, according to Bank of America. However, Fitch Ratings estimated that the rate of growth was twice that of nominal GDP. According to the People's Bank of China, the nation's debt-to-disposable income ratio was 99.9% in 2019, up from 93.4% the previous year. = Europe = In Europe, although the unemployment rates of France and Italy remained relatively high, they were markedly lower than previously. Meanwhile, the German unemployment rate dipped below even that of the United States, a level not seen since its unification almost three decades prior. Eurostat reported in 2019 that overall unemployment rate across the European Union dropped to its lowest level since January 2000, at 6.2% in August, meaning about 15.4 million people were out of a job. The Czech Republic (3%), Germany (3.1%) and Malta (3.3%) enjoyed the lowest levels of unemployment. Member states with the highest unemployment rates were Italy (9.5%), Spain (13.8%), and Greece (17%). Countries with higher unemployment rates compared to 2018 were Denmark (from 4.9% to 5%), Lithuania (6.1% to 6.6%), and Sweden (6.3% to 7.1%). In November 2019, the European Commission expressed concern over the fact that some member states have \\"failed to put their finances in order.\\" Belgium, France, and Spain had a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 100% each while Italy's was 136%. Under E.U. rules, member nations must take steps to decrease public debt if it exceeds 60% of GDP. The Commission commended Greece for making progress in economic recovery.Top five professions with insufficient workers in the European Union (late 2010s). According to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), the European Union in the late 2010s suffers from shortages of STEM specialists (including ICT professionals), medical doctors, nurses, midwives and schoolteachers. However, the picture varies depending on the country. In Italy, environmentally friendly architecture is in high demand. Estonia and France are running short of legal professionals. Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, and the United Kingdom need more financial experts. All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the dropout rate is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments. Indeed, many have left the public sector for industry while some STEM graduates have taken non-STEM jobs. Spanish think-tank Fedea noted that there were not enough young Europeans enrolled in vocational programs that teach them skills favored by the job market. Many new entrants to the workforce lacked the necessary skills demanded by employers. Even though pundits predicted that the uncertainty due to the Brexit referendum would cause the British economy to falter or even fall into a recession, the unemployment rate has dipped below 4% while real wages have risen slightly in the late 2010s, two percent as of 2019. In particular, medical doctors and dentists saw their earnings bumped above the inflation rate in July 2019. Despite the fact that the government promised to an increase in public spending (¬£13 billion, or 0.6% of GDP) in September 2019, public deficit continues to decline, as it has since 2010. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounding Britain's international trade policy suppressed the chances of an export boom despite the depreciation of the pound sterling. According to the employment website Glassdoor, the highest paying entry level jobs in the United Kingdom in 2019 are investment banking analyst, software engineer, business analyst, data scientist, financial analyst, software developer, civil engineer, audit assistant, design engineer, mechanical engineer. Their median base salaries range from about ¬£28,000 to ¬£51,000 a year. In general, people with STEM degrees have the best chances of being recruited into a high-paying job. According to the Office for National Statistics, the median income of the United Kingdom in 2018 was ¬£29,588. In the United Kingdom, the number of teenagers who owned businesses jumped from 491 in 2009 to 4,152 in 2019. These people primarily use social media platforms to establish their careers. Due to the strong correlation between economic growth and youth employment, recessions come with dire consequences for young people in the workforce. In the struggling Southern European economies, such as Greece and Spain, youth unemployment lingered on in the aftermath of the Great Recession, remaining stuck at around a third. With another recession induced by the COVID-19 global pandemic, it could rise to about half. Even the Czech Republic, which previously boasted the lowest youth unemployment rate in Europe, at about 5%, could see that number triple in 2020. Overall, European job markets are hostile towards new entrants, who, unlike their older counterparts, do not have permanent contracts and are often the first to be laid off during hard times. E.U. average unemployment has gone up, but youth unemployment went up even more; among workers below the age of 25, it stood at 15.7% in May 2020. = North America = Railroad engineering was one of the top professions in Canada in 2017. Pictured: An Ottawa-bound train passing through Brighton, Ontario. Between 2014 and 2019, Canada's overall unemployment rate fell from about 7% to below 6%, according to the IMF. In 2017, the magazine Canadian Business analyzed publicly available data from Statistics Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada to determine the top occupations on the basis of growth and salaries. They included construction managers, mining and quarry managers, pilots and flying instructors, software engineers, police officers, firefighters, urban planners, petroleum, chemical, agricultural, biomedical, aerospace, and railroad engineers, business services managers, deck officers, corporate sales managers, pharmacists, elevator mechanics, lawyers, economic development directors, real-estate and financial managers, telecommunications managers, utilities managers, pipe-fitting managers, forestry managers, nurse practitioners, and public administration managers. However, in the late 2010s, Canada's oil and gas industry has been in decline due to a lack of political support and unfavorable policies from Ottawa. The number of oil rigs in Western Canada, where most of the country's deposits are located, dropped from 900 in 2014 to 550 in 2019. Many Canadian companies have moved their crew and equipment to the United States, especially to Texas. Americans aged 15 to 21 expect to be financially independent in their early twenties while their parents generally expect them to become so by their mid-twenties. While the Millennials tend to prefer flexibility, Generation Z is more interested in certainty and stability. Whereas 23% of Millennials would leave a job if they thought they were not appreciated, only 15% of Generation Z would do the same, according to a Deloitte survey. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), 77% of Generation Z expects to work harder than previous generations. As a result, barely one in two recruits from Generation Z are willing to negotiate a higher salary, even though, as of 2019, the U.S. labor market is very tight, meaning the balance of power is currently in favor of job seekers, collectively. Indeed, Employers are open to negotiations for higher salaries and better benefits in order to attract talents. While there is agreement across generations that it is very important for employees to learn new skills, Millennials and Generation Z are overwhelmingly more likely than Baby Boomers to think that it is the job of employees to train themselves. Baby Boomers tend to think it is the employer's responsibility. Moreover, Millennials and Generation Z (74%) tend to have more colleagues working remotely for a significant portion of their time compared to the Baby Boomers (58%). An overwhelming majority, 80%, prefers to work for a medium-sized or large company. A Morgan Stanley report, called the Blue Paper, projected that the Millennials and Generation Z have been responsible in a surge in labor participation in the U.S., and that while the U.S. labor force expands, that of other G10 countries will contract. This development alleviates concerns over America's aging population which jeopardizes the solvency of various welfare programs. As of 2019, Millennials and Generation Z account for 38% of the U.S. workforce; that number will rise to 58% in the incoming decade. According to the United States Department of Labor, the unemployment rate in September 2019 was 3.5%, a number not seen since December 1969. At the same time, labor participation remained steady and most job growth tended to be full-time positions. The number of people who ended up with part-time positions despite looking for full-time jobs dropped to 4.32 million, below the average of the previous three decades. Economists generally consider a population with an unemployment rate lower than 4% to be fully employed. In fact, even people with disabilities or prison records are getting hired. On average, they grew by 2.7% in 2016, 3.3% in 2018, and 3.3% in 2019. However, the Pew Research Center found that the average wage in the U.S. in 2018 remained more or less the same as it was in 1978, when the seasons and inflation are taken into consideration. Real wages grew only for the top 90th percentile of earners and to a lesser extent the 75th percentile (in 2018 dollars). Nevertheless, these developments ease fears of an upcoming recession. Moreover, economists believe that job growth could slow to an average of just 100,000 per month and still be sufficient to keep up with population growth and keep economic recovery going. As long as firms keep hiring and wages keep growing, consumer spending should prevent another recession. Appearing before Congress in November 2019, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that while the U.S. economy had taken a long time to recover from the Great Recession, it now enjoyed a strong labor market, low inflation, and moderate growth, and that his agency expected continued economic growth. At the same time, U.S. household debt fell from 90% of GDP in 2010 to 75% in 2019, according to Bank of America. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the occupations with the highest median annual pay in the United States in 2018 included medical doctors (especially psychiatrists, anesthesiologists, obstetricians and gynecologists, surgeons, and orthodontists), chief executives, dentists, information system managers, chief architects and engineers, pilots and flight engineers, petroleum engineers, and marketing managers. Their median annual pay ranged from about $134,000 (marketing managers) to over $208,000 (aforementioned medical specialties). Meanwhile, the occupations with the fastest projected growth rate between 2018 and 2028 are solar cell and wind turbine technicians, healthcare and medical aides, cyber security experts, statisticians, speech-language pathologists, genetic counselors, mathematicians, operations research analysts, software engineers, forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists, post-secondary health instructors, and phlebotomists. Their projected growth rates are between 23% (medical assistants) and 63% (solar cell installers); their annual median pays range between roughly $24,000 (personal care aides) to over $108,000 (physician assistants). Occupations with the highest projected numbers of jobs added between 2018 and 2028 are healthcare and personal aides, nurses, restaurant workers (including cooks and waiters), software developers, janitors and cleaners, medical assistants, construction workers, freight laborers, marketing researchers and analysts, management analysts, landscapers and groundskeepers, financial managers, tractor and truck drivers, and medical secretaries. The total numbers of jobs added ranges from 881,000 (personal care aides) to 96,400 (medical secretaries). Annual median pays range from over $24,000 (fast-food workers) to about $128,000 (financial managers). According to the Department of Education, people with technical or vocational trainings are slightly more likely to be employed than those with a bachelor's degree and significantly more likely to be employed in their fields of specialty. The United States currently suffers from a shortage of skilled tradespeople. If nothing is done, this problem will get worse as older workers retire and the market tightens due to falling unemployment rates. Economists argue that raising wages could incentivize more young people to pursue these careers. Many manufacturers are partnering with community colleges to create apprenticeship and training programs. However, they still have an image problem as people perceive manufacturing jobs as unstable, given the mass layoffs during the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì8. After the Great Recession, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs reached a minimum of 11.5 million in February 2010. It rose to 12.8 million in September 2019. It was 14 million in March 2007. As of 2019, manufacturing industries made up 12% of the U.S. economy, which is increasingly reliant on service industries, as is the case for other advanced economies around the world. Nevertheless, twenty-first- century manufacturing is increasingly sophisticated, using advanced robotics, 3D printing, cloud computing, among other modern technologies, and technologically savvy employees are precisely who employers need. Four-year university degrees are unnecessary; technical or vocational training, or perhaps apprenticeships would do. = South America = Unlike some major economies, unemployment actually increased in Brazil, from about 6.7% in 2014 to about 11.4% in 2018. Although its economy remains growing, it is still recovering from a recession in 2015 and 2016. Wages have remained stagnant and the labor market has been weak. Unemployment rose to 12.7% in March 2019, or about 13.4 million people. Underemployment also increased in the first quarter of 2019.  Health issues  = Mental = According to the OECD PISA surveys, 15-year-olds in 2015 had a tougher time making friends at school than ten years prior. European teenagers were becoming more and more like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts in social isolation. This might be due to intrusive parenting, heavy use of electronic devices, and concerns over academic performance and job prospects. = Physical = Multidisciplinary research in the early twenty-first century suggests that ongoing human evolution could help explain the rise of certain medical conditions such as autism and autoimmune disorders among children. Autism and schizophrenia may be due to genes inherited from the mother and the father that are over- expressed and that fight a tug-of-war in the child's body. Allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disorders appear linked to higher standards of sanitation, which prevent the immune systems of modern humans from being exposed to various parasites and pathogens the way their ancestors' were, making them hypersensitive and more likely to overreact. The human body is not built from a professionally engineered blueprint, but rather is a system shaped over long periods of time by evolution with all kinds of trade-offs and imperfections. Understanding the evolution of the human body can help medical doctors better understand and treat various disorders. Research in evolutionary medicine suggests that diseases are prevalent because natural selection favors reproduction over health and longevity. In addition, biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.Anatomical diagram of myopia or nearsightedness.A 2015 study found that the frequency of nearsightedness has doubled in the United Kingdom within the last 50 years. Ophthalmologist Steve Schallhorn, chairman of the Optical Express International Medical Advisory Board, noted that research have pointed to a link between the regular use of handheld electronic devices and eyestrain. The American Optometric Association sounded the alarm on a similar vein. According to a spokeswoman, digital eyestrain, or computer vision syndrome, is \\"rampant, especially as we move toward smaller devices and the prominence of devices increase in our everyday lives.\\" Symptoms include dry and irritated eyes, fatigue, eye strain, blurry vision, difficulty focusing, headaches. However, the syndrome does not cause vision loss or any other permanent damage. In order to alleviate or prevent eyestrain, the Vision Council recommends that people limit screen time, take frequent breaks, adjust screen brightness, change the background from bright colors to gray, increase text sizes, and blinking more often. Parents should not only limit their children's screen time but should also lead by example. While food allergies have been observed by doctors since ancient times and virtually all foods can be allergens, research by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota found they are becoming increasingly common since the early 2000s. Today, one in twelve American children has a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent type. Reasons for this remain poorly understood. Nut allergies in general have quadrupled and shellfish allergies have increased 40% between 2004 and 2019. In all, about 36% of American children have some kind of allergy. By comparison, this number among the Amish in Indiana is 7%. Allergies have also risen ominously in other Western countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the number of children hospitalized for allergic reactions increased by a factor of five between 1990 and the late 2010s, as did the number of British children allergic to peanuts. In general, the better developed the country, the higher the rates of allergies. Reasons for this remain poorly understood. One possible explanation, supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is that parents keep their children \\"too clean for their own good.\\" They recommend exposing newborn babies to a variety of potentially allergenic foods, such as peanut butter, before they reach the age of six months. According to this \\"hygiene hypothesis,\\" such exposures give the infant's immune system some exercise, making it less likely to overreact. Evidence for this includes the fact that children living on a farm are consistently less likely to be allergic than their counterparts who are raised in the city, and that children born in a developed country to parents who immigrated from developing nations are more likely to be allergic than their parents are. A research article published in 2019 in the Lancet journal reported that the number of South Africans aged 15 to 19 being treated for HIV increased by a factor of ten between 2019 and 2010. This is partly due to improved detection and treatment programs. However, less than 50% of the people diagnosed with HIV went onto receive antiviral medication due to social stigma, concerns about clinical confidentiality, and domestic responsibilities. While the annual number of deaths worldwide due to HIV/AIDS has declined from its peak in the early 2000s, experts warned that this venereal disease could rebound if the world's booming adolescent population is left unprotected. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that 46% of Australians aged 18 to 24, about a million people, were overweight in 2017 and 2018. That number was 39% in 2014 and 2015. Obese individuals face higher risks of type II diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis and stroke. The Australian Medical Associated and Obesity Coalition have urged the federal government to levy a tax on sugary drinks, to require health ratings, and to regulate the advertisement of fast foods. In all, the number of Australian adults who are overweight or obese rose from 63% in 2014‚Äì15 to 67% in 2017‚Äì18.  Political views and participation  centerIn 2016, the Varkey Foundation and Populus conducted an international study examining the attitudes of 20,000 people aged 15 to 21 in twenty countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the U.K, and the U.S.A. They found that young people's support for free speech dwindled if it was deemed offensive to a religion (56%) or a minority group (49%). The question of whether or not they favored legal migration received mixed responses, with 27% saying 'yes' in France, 31% in the U.K., 37% in Germany, and 38% in Italy and the U.S. Overall, 31% believed their governments should make it easier for immigrants to work and live legally in their countries while 23% said it should be more difficult, a margin of 8%. (See chart above.) While 72% of Brazilian youths thought their government was doing too little to address the international refugee crisis, only 16% of young Turks did; in the U.K. that number was 48%. Overall, their top concerns for the future included extremism and terrorism (83%), war (81%), the widening gap between the rich and the poor (69%), the lack of access to education (69%), climate change (63%), and the risk of a global pandemic (62%). center alt= The same international survey also asked about people's viewpoints on moral questions regarding sex and gender. Overall 89% supported sexual equality, with support being the highest in Canada and China (both 94%), and the lowest in Japan (74%) and Nigeria (68%). 74% favored recognizing transgender rights, but with large national differences, from an overwhelming majority of 83% in Canada to a bare majority of 57% in Nigeria. 63% approved of same-sex marriage. There were again huge variations among countries. 81% of young Germans and 80% of young Canadians agreed that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, compared to only 33% of young Turks and 16% of young Nigerians who did. A 2018 poll conducted by Harris on behalf of the LGBT advocacy group GLAAD found that despite being frequently described as the most tolerant segment of society, Americans aged 18 to 34‚Äîmost Millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z‚Äîhave become less accepting LGBT individuals compared to previous years. In 2016, 63% of Americans in that age group said they felt comfortable interacting with members of the LGBT community; that number dropped to 53% in 2017 and then to 45% in 2018. On top of that, more people reported discomfort learning that a family member was LGBT (from 29% in 2017 to 36% in 2018), having a child learning LGBT history (30% to 39%), or having an LGBT doctor (27% to 34%). Harris found that young women were driving this development; their overall comfort levels dived from 64% in 2017 to 52% in 2018. In general, the fall of comfort levels was the steepest among people aged 18 to 34 between 2016 and 2018. (Seniors aged 72 or above became more accepting of LGBT doctors and having their (grand) children taking LGBT history lessons during the same period, albeit with a bump in discomfort levels in 2017.) Results from this Harris poll were released on the 50th anniversary of the riots that broke out in Stonewall Inn, New York City, in June 1969, thought to be the start of the LGBT rights movement. At that time, homosexuality was considered a mental illness or a crime in many U.S. states. centerThe aforementioned international survey by the Varkey Foundation showed that 66% of people aged 15 to 21 favored legal abortion. But there was significant variation among the countries surveyed. Support for this procedure was strongest in France (84%), the United Kingdom (80%), and Canada (79%), but lowest in Argentina (50%), Brazil (45%), and Nigeria (24%). (See chart above.) (As of 2016, it remained illegal in Nigeria.) Gallup polls conducted in 2019 in the U.S. revealed that 62% of people aged 18 to 29‚Äîolder members of Generation Z and younger Millennials‚Äîsupport giving women access to abortion while 33% opposed. In general, the older someone was, the less likely that they supported abortion. 56% of people aged 65 or over did not approve of abortion compared to 37% who did. (See chart to the right.) Gallup found in 2018 that nationwide, Americans were split on the issue of abortion, with equal numbers of people considering themselves \\"pro-life\\" or \\"pro-choice\\", 48%. Goldman Sachs analysts Robert Boroujerdi and Christopher Wolf described Generation Z as \\"more conservative, more money-oriented, more entrepreneurial and pragmatic about money compared with Millennials.\\" In 2018, the International Federation of Accountants released a report on a survey of 3,388 individuals aged 18 to 23 hailing from G20 countries, with a sample size of 150 to 300 per country. They found that members of Generation Z prefer a nationalist to a globalist approach to public policy by a clear margin, 51% to 32%. Nationalism was strongest in China (by a 44% margin), India (30%), South Africa (37%), and Russia (32%), while support for globalism was strongest in France (20% margin) and Germany (3%). In general, for members of Generation Z, the top three priorities for public policy are the stability of the national economy, the quality of education, and the availability of jobs; the bottom issues, on the other hand, were addressing income and wealth inequality, making regulations smarter and more effective, and improving the effectiveness of international taxation. Moreover, healthcare is a top priority for Generation Z in Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. Addressing climate change is very important for Generation Z in India, and South Korea, and tackling wealth and income inequality is of vital importance to the same in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. left 2018 surveys of American teenagers 13 to 17 and adults aged 18 or over conducted by the Pew Research Center found that Generation Z had broadly similar views to the Millennials on various political and social issues. More specifically, 54% of Generation Z believed that climate change is real and is due to human activities while only 10% reject the scientific consensus on climate change. (See chart.) 70% wanted the government to play a more active role in solving their problems. 67% were indifferent towards pre-nuptial cohabitation. 49% considered single motherhood to be neither a positive or a negative for society. 62% saw increased ethnic or racial diversity as good for society. As did 48% for same-sex marriage, and 53% for interracial marriage. In most cases, Generation Z and the Millennials tended hold quite different views from the Silent Generation, with the Baby Boomers and Generation X in between. In the case of financial responsibility in a two-parent household, though, majorities from across the generations answered that it should be shared, with 58% for the Silent Generation, 73% for the Baby Boomers, 78% for Generation X, and 79% for both the Millennials and Generation Z. Across all the generations surveyed, at least 84% thought that both parents ought to be responsible for rearing children. About 13% of Generation Z thought that mothers should be the primary caretaker of children, with similar percentages for the other demographic cohorts. Very few thought that fathers should be the ones mainly responsible for taking care of children. In a study conducted in 2015 the Center for Generational Kinetics found that American Generation Zers, defined here as those born 1996 and onwards, are less optimistic about the state of the US economy than their generation predecessors, Millennials. Despite reports of a surge in turnouts among young voters in the 2015 and 2017 United Kingdom general elections, statistical scrutiny by the British Elections Study revealed that the margin of error was too large to determine whether or not there was a significant increase or decrease in the number of young participants. In both cases, turnouts among those aged 18 to 24 was between 40% and 50%. Winning the support of young people does not necessarily translate to increasing young voters' turnouts, and positive reactions on social media may not lead to success at the ballot box. Initial reports of a youth surge came from constituency-level survey data, which has a strong chance of over-representing voters rather than the Kingdom as a whole. In addition, higher turnouts generally came from constituencies where there were already large proportions of young people, both toddlers and young adults, and such surges did not necessarily come from young voters. In 2017, there was indeed an increase in overall voter turnout, but only by 2.5%. Similarly, in the United States, despite the hype surrounding the political engagement and record turnout among young voters, their voting power has actually declined. In round terms, the share of voters between the ages of 18 and 24 will fall from 13% in 2000 to 12% in 2020 while that of voters aged 65 and over will rise from 18% to 23% during the same period, according to Richard Fry of the Pew Research Center. A consistent trend in the U.K. and many other countries is that older people are more likely to vote than their younger countrymen, and they tend to vote for more right-leaning (or conservative) candidates. According to Sean Simpsons of Ipsos, people are more likely to vote when they have more at stake, such as children to raise, homes to maintain, and income taxes to pay. A 2017 survey produced by MTV and the Public Religion Research Institute found that 72% of Americans aged 15 to 24 held unfavorable views of President Donald Trump. In a 2016 poll of Gen Z-aged students by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, 32% of participants supported Donald Trump, while 22% supported Hillary Clinton with 31% declining to choose. By contrast, in a 2016 mock election of upper elementary, middle, and high school students conducted by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump among the students, with Clinton receiving 46% of the vote, Donald Trump receiving 41%, and other candidates receiving 12%. 400x400px The March for Our Lives was a 2018 demonstration demanding stricter gun-control legislation following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. An opinion piece titled \\"Dear National Rifle Association: We Won't Let You Win, From, Teenagers\\" published in March 2018 in The New York Times describes Generation Z as the generation after Millennials who will \\"not forget the elected officials who turned their backs on their duty to protect children.\\" However, according to a field survey by The Washington Post interviewing every fifth person at the protest, only ten percent of the participants were 18 years of age or younger. Meanwhile, the adult participants of the protest had an average age of just under 49. Polls conducted by Gallup and the Pew Research Center found that support for stricter gun laws among people aged 18 to 29 and 18 to 36, respectively, is statistically no different from that of the general population. According to Gallup, 57% of Americans are in favor of stronger gun control legislation. In a 2017 poll, Pew found that among the age group 18 to 29, 27% personally owned a gun and 16% lived with a gun owner, for a total of 43% living in a household with at least one gun. Nationwide, a similar percentage of American adults lived in a household with a gun. (See chart.) A YouGov poll conducted in the spring of 2018 revealed that 41% of Britons between the ages of 18 to 24 thought that immigration to their country was \\"too high,\\" compared to 58% of those 25 and 49. Another YouGov 2018 poll asked British voters whether leaving the European Union was a good idea in hindsight. They found that 42% said yes while 45% said no. Among them, 19% of those between the ages of 18 to 24 said yes, as did 61% of pensioners. Overall the British public has not changed their minds on the issue. By analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be demographically displaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, Marine Le Pen and her National Rally (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. Moreover, the share of women aged 18 to 26 who backed the Le Pen political family rose from 9% in 1988 to 32% in 2017, closing the gender gap in the process. In Italy, Matteo Salvini and his League have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the Freedom Party in 2016. The Sweden Democrats were the second most popular political party for voters aged 18 to 24 and the most popular for the 35 and 54 in 2018. The year of 2020 marks the entry of Generation Z into the Brazilian electoral race, with the youngest group being between 18 and 20 years old.  Religious tendencies  the A 2016 survey by Varkey Foundation and Populus conducted on 20,000 people aged 15 to 21 from twenty countries from all inhabited continents revealed that religious faith was influential to 42% of the respondents and inconsequential to 39%. There was, however, a clear difference along the age subgroups, with people 15-16 slightly more likely to value religion as important than those aged 19‚Äì21 (47% vs. 43%). Nevertheless, for 53%, religion influenced the values they hold. In order to further determine the role of religion in young people's lives, the pollsters asked them (1) whether or not it was important to them personally, (2) to their parents, (3) whether their parents' religion determined whom they would marry, and (4) if religion helps them decide whether to be friends with someone. Overall, religion was important to 11% of respondents. But there was a large gap among countries with Nigeria at one end (32%) and Germany and Japan on the other (3%). (See above.) The 2016 British Social Attitudes Survey found that 71% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 had no religion, compared to 62% the year before. A 2018 ComRes survey found that slightly more than one in two of those aged 18 to 24 reported a positive experience with Christians and Christianity. Two-thirds of the same age group have never attended church; among the remaining third, 20% went a few times a year, and 2% multiple times per week. 12% of respondents aged 18 to 24 agreed with the claim that Christians were a bad influence on society, compared to just over half who disagreed. For comparison, 14% of those aged 25 to 34 agreed. In all, 51% of Britons disagreed with the same while 10% agreed. Results from the 2018 the ComRes survey were released a day after the Church of England announced it was going to establish more than a hundred churches, mainly in urban areas, to attract new followers. 440x440px A 2016 U.S. study found that church attendance during young adulthood was 41% among Generation Z, compared to 18% for Millennials, 21% of Generation X, and 26% of the Baby Boomers when they were at the same age. A 2016 survey by Barna and Impact 360 Institute on about 1,500 Americans aged 13 and up suggests that the percentage of atheists and agnostics was 21% among Generation Z, compared to 15% for Millennials, 13% for Generation X, and 9% for Baby Boomers. 59% of Generation Z were Christians (including Catholics), compared to 65% for the Millennials, 65% for Generation X, and 75% for the Baby Boomers. Researchers also asked over 600 non-Christian teenagers and almost 500 adults what their biggest barriers to faith were. They found that for Generation Z, these were what they perceived as internal contradictions of the religion and its believers, yet only six percent reported an unpleasant personal experience with a Christian or at church. Indeed, perception of this establishment tended to be overwhelmingly positive. 82% believed the church was relevant and helped them live a meaningful life. 77% thought they could be themselves at church, and 63% deemed the church to be tolerant of different beliefs. Only 27% considered the church to be unsafe for expressing doubts. 24% argued that religion and religious thought were shallow, and 17% thought it was too exclusive. 46% of adolescents require factual evidence before believing in something, on par with Millennials. 41% of teens believed that science and the Bible are fundamentally at odds with one another, with 27% taking the side of science and 17% picking religion. For comparison, 45% of Millennials, 34% of Generation X, and 29% of the Baby Boomers believed such a conflict exists. 31% of Generation Z believed that science and religion refer to different aspects of reality, on par with Millennials and Generation X (both 30%), and above the Baby Boomers (25%). 28% of Generation Z thought that science and religion are complementary, compared to 25% of Millennials, 36% of Generation X, and 45% for Baby Boomers. Globally, religion is in decline in North America and Western Europe, but is growing in the rest of the world. Although the number of atheists, agnostics, and people not affiliated with organized religion continues to grow in Europe and the United States, their percentage of the world population is falling because of their comparatively low fertility rate (1.7). In general, the growth or decline of a given religion is due more to age and fertility rather than conversion. Besides the level of education and income, how religious a woman is determines how many children she will bear in her lifetime. For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century. According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025. In addition, the Catholic Church has gained 12% additional followers between 2000 and 2010, mainly from Asia and Africa. In 2018, Muslims had a median age of 23, Hindus 26, Christians 30, Buddhists and the religiously unaffiliated 34, and Jews 36. For comparison, the median age of the global population was 28 in 2018. Overall, Christians have a fertility rate of 2.6, and Muslims 2.9. Islam is the world's fastest growing religion. Meanwhile, the expansion of secularism will slow in Europe as the twenty-first century progresses. But religion can grow even in otherwise secular societies. For example, in Israel, the ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just about five percent of the nation's primary schoolchildren in 1960, but by the start of the twenty-first century, one third of Jewish first graders in Israel came from this religious sect. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women in Israel had on average 7.5 children compared to their more mainstream counterparts with just over two in the early 2000s. In Europe, immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77. In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists, who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s. In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization. Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three quarters of Jewish births at the start of the twenty-first century. (This group is projected to make up the majority of Anglo-American Jews by 2050.) In the United States, Catholicism will become the largest religion by 2040 despite considerable losses to secularization and conversion to Protestantism thanks in no small part to the fact that Latino Catholics had a fertility rate of 2.83 compared to the national average of 2.03 in 2003. Such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.  Risky behaviors  Generation Z is generally more risk- averse in certain activities than earlier generations. In 2013, 66% of American teenagers (older members of Generation Z) had tried alcohol, down from 82% in 1991 (younger Generation X). Also, in 2013, 8% of teenagers never or rarely wore a seat belt when riding in a car with someone else, as opposed to 26% in 1991. Research from the Annie E. Casey Foundation conducted in 2016 found Generation Z youth had lower teen pregnancy rates, less substance abuse, and higher on-time high school graduation rates compared with Millennials. The researchers compared teens from 2008 and 2014 and found a 40% drop in teen pregnancy, a 38% drop in drug and alcohol abuse, and a 28% drop in the percentage of teens who did not graduate on time from high school. American adolescents maintained their abstinence from alcohol and sexual intercourse through early adulthood. During the 2010s, when most of Generation Z experienced some or all of their adolescence, reductions in youth crime were seen in some Western countries. A report looking at statistics from 2018 to 2019 noted that the numbers of young people aged ten to seventeen in England and Wales being cautioned or sentenced for criminal activity had fallen by 83% over the previous decade, while those entering the youth justice system for the first time had fallen by 85%. In 2006, 3,000 youths in England and Wales were detained for criminal activity; ten years later, that number fell below 1,000. In Europe, teenagers were less likely to fight than before. Research from Australia suggested that crime rates among adolescents had consistently declined between 2010 and 2019. In a 2014 report, Statistics Canada stated that police-reported crimes committed by persons between the ages of 12 and 17 had been falling steadily since 2006 as part of a larger trend of decline from a peak in 1991. Between 2000 and 2014, youth crimes plummeted 42%, above the drop for overall crime of 34%. In fact, between the late 2000s and mid-2010s, the fall was especially rapid. This was primarily driven by a 51% drop in theft of items worth no more than CAN$5,000 and burglary. The most common types of crime committed by Canadian adolescents were theft and violence. At school, the most frequent offenses were possession of cannabis, common assault, and uttering threats. Overall, although they made up only 7% of the population, adolescents stood accused of 13% of all crimes in Canada. In addition, mid- to late-teens were more likely to be accused of crimes than any other age group in the country.  Use of information and communications technologies (ICT)  Generation Z was one of the first generations to have widespread access to the Internet at an early age. = Use of ICT in general = Generation Z is the first cohort to have Internet technology readily available at a young age. With the web revolution that occurred throughout the 1990s, they have been exposed to an unprecedented amount of technology in their upbringing, with the use of mobile devices growing exponentially over time. Anthony Turner characterizes Generation Z as having a 'digital bond to the Internet', and argues that it may help youth to escape from emotional and mental struggles they face offline. According to U.S. consultants Sparks and Honey in 2014, 41% of Generation Z spend more than three hours per day using computers for purposes other than schoolwork, compared with 22% in 2004. In 2015, an estimated 150,000 apps, 10% of those in Apple's App Store, were educational and aimed at children up to college level, though opinions are mixed as to whether the net result will be deeper involvement in learning and more individualized instruction, or impairment through greater technology dependence and a lack of self-regulation that may hinder child development. Parents of Gen Zers fear the overuse of the Internet, and dislike the ease of access to inappropriate information and images, as well as social networking sites where children can gain access to people worldwide. Children reversely feel annoyed with their parents and complain about parents being overly controlling when it comes to their Internet usage. In a TEDxHouston talk, Jason Dorsey of the Center for Generational Kinetics stressed the notable differences in the way that Millennials and Generation Z consume technology, with 18% of Generation Z feeling that it is okay for a 13-year-old to have a smartphone, compared with just 4% for the previous generation. An online newspaper about texting, SMS and MMS writes that teens own cellphones without necessarily needing them; that receiving a phone is considered a rite of passage in some countries, allowing the owner to be further connected with their peers, and it is now a social norm to have one at an early age. An article from the Pew Research Center stated that \\"nearly three-quarters of teens have or have access to a smartphone and 30% have a basic phone, while just 12% of teens 13 to 15 say they have no cell phone of any type\\". These numbers are only on the rise and the fact that the majority own a cell phone has become one of this generations defining characteristics. Consequently, \\"24% of teens go online 'almost constantly'.\\" A survey of students from 79 countries by the OECD found that the amounts of time spent using an electronic device has increased, from under two hours per weekday in 2012 to close to three in 2019, at the expense of extracurricular reading. = Digital literacy = Despite being labeled as 'digital natives', the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), conducted on 42,000 eighth- graders (or equivalents) from 14 countries and education systems, found that only two percent of these people were sufficiently proficient with information devices to justify that description, and only 19% could work independently with computers to gather information and to manage their work. ICILS assesses students on two main categories: Computer and Information Literacy (CIL), and Computational Thinking (CT). For CIL, there are four levels, one to four, with Level 4 being the highest. Although at least 80% students from most countries tested reached Level 1, only two percent on average reached Level 4. Countries or education systems whose students scored near or above the international average of 496 in CIL were, in increasing order, France, North Rhine- Westphalia, Portugal, Germany, the United States, Finland, South Korea, Moscow, and Denmark. CT is divided into four levels, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Regions. International averages for the proportions of students reaching each of these were 18%, 50%, and 32%, respectively. Countries or education systems whose students scored near or above the international average of 500 were, in increasing order, the United States, France, Finland, Denmark, and South Korea. In general, female eighth-graders outperformed their male counterparts in CIL by an international average of 18 points but were narrowly outclassed by their male counterparts in CT. (Narrow gaps made estimates of averages have higher coefficients of variation.) In the United States, where the computer-based tests were administered by the National Center for Education Statistics, 72% of eighth-graders said they searched for information on the Internet at least once a week or every school day, and 65% reported they were autodidactic information finders on the Internet. = Social media networks = The use of social media has become integrated into the daily lives of most Gen Zers with access to mobile technology, who use it primarily to keep in contact with friends and family. As a result, mobile technology has caused online relationship development to become a new generational norm. Gen Z uses social media and other sites to strengthen bonds with friends and to develop new ones. They interact with people who they otherwise would not have met in the real world, becoming a tool for identity creation. The negative side to mobile devices for Generation Z, according to Twenge, is they are less \\"face to face\\", and thus feel more lonely and left out. Focus group testing found that while teens may be annoyed by many aspects of Facebook, they continue to use it because participation is important in terms of socializing with friends and peers. Twitter and Instagram are seen to be gaining popularity among members of Generation Z, with 24% (and growing) of teens with access to the Internet having Twitter accounts. This is, in part, due to parents not typically using these social networking sites. Snapchat is also seen to have gained attraction in Generation Z because videos, pictures, and messages send much faster on it than in regular messaging. Speed and reliability are important factors in members of Generation Z choice of social networking platform. This need for quick communication is presented in popular Generation Z apps like Vine and the prevalent use of emojis. A study by Gabrielle Borca, et al found that teenagers in 2012 were more likely to share different types of information than teenagers in 2006. However, they will take steps to protect information that they do not want being shared, and are more likely to \\"follow\\" others on social media than \\"share\\". A survey of U.S. teenagers from advertising agency J. Walter Thomson likewise found that the majority of teenagers are concerned about how their posting will be perceived by people or their friends. 72% of respondents said they were using social media on a daily basis, and 82% said they thought carefully about what they post on social media. Moreover, 43% said they had regrets about previous posts. Research conducted in 2017 reports that the social media usage patterns of this generation may be associated with loneliness, anxiety, and fragility, and that girls may be more affected than boys by social media. According to 2018 CDC reports, girls are disproportionately affected by the negative aspects of social media than boys.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2015. Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data. Available at: cdc.gov/yrbs. Researchers at the University of Essex analyzed data from 10,000 families, from 2010 to 2015, assessing their mental health utilizing two perspectives: Happiness and Well-being throughout social, familial, and educational perspectives. Within each family, they examined children who had grown from 10 to 15 during these years. At age 10, 10% of female subjects reported social media use, while this was only true for 7% of the male subjects. By age 15, this variation jumped to 53% for girls, and 41% for boys. This percentage influx may explain why more girls reported experiencing cyberbullying, decreased self-esteem, and emotional instability more than their male counterparts. Other researchers hypothesize that girls are more affected by social media usage because of how they use it. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, researchers discovered that while 78% girls reported to making a friend through social media, only 52% of boys could say the same. However, boys are not explicitly less affected by this statistic. They also found that 57% of boys claimed to make friends through video gaming, while this was only true for 13% of girls. Another Pew Research Center survey conducted in April 2015, reported that women are more likely to use Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram than men. In counterpoint, men were more likely to utilize online forums, e-chat groups, and Reddit than women. Cyberbullying is more common now than among Millennials, the previous generation. It's more common among girls, 22% compared to 10% for boys. This results in young girls feeling more vulnerable to being excluded and undermined. =Online dating= According to the Pew Research Center, although only a negligible number of people dated online in 2005, that rose to 11% in 2013 and then 15% in 2015. This increase was driven mainly by people aged 18 to 24, whose usage almost tripled, and those aged 55 to 64, whose doubled. Attitudes towards online dating has improved, though only 5% of online daters said they were married to or in a committed relationship with someone they met online.

K. Chesterton, who appears in 48 short stories about the character Father Brown. A master criminal, his surname \\"Flambeau\\" is an alias, the French word for a flaming torch. He first appeared in the story \\"The Blue Cross\\" as a jewel thief. Father Brown foiled his attempted crimes in this and several other stories. As a notorious and elusive criminal, Flambeau is a worry for law- enforcers. He is exposed by Father Brown, and later becomes a detective himself. His last appearance as a thief occurs in \\"The Flying Stars\\", in which Father Brown persuades him to return his loot and to give up the criminal life. As a reformed criminal, Flambeau assists Father Brown in a number of other short stories, beginning with \\"The Invisible Man\\". Although Brown and Flambeau spend much of the day together in \\"The Blue Cross\\", when they meet again in \\"The Queer Feet\\", Brown recognizes Flambeau but the thief has no recollection of the priest. He becomes Flambeau's friend before he reforms him, and uses this friendship to transform him. In \\"The Secret of Flambeau\\", Flambeau credits Father Brown for his reformation when he says, \\"Have I not heard the sermons of the righteous? [‚Ä¶] Do you think all that ever did anything but make me laugh? Only my friend told me that he knew exactly why I stole, and I have never stolen since.\\" Flambeau's fate is revealed in \\"The Secret of Father Brown\\". Retiring as a detective, he marries and settles in a Spanish castle, raises a large family and lives in a blissful state of domesticity. Flambeau gives up his assumed name and returns to using his birth name, Duroc. It has been suggested that Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot was inspired by the character. Flambeau has appeared in several film, television and radio adaptations.

Dioscorides wrote the book between 50 and 60 AD. The history of plant systematics--the biological classification of plants--stretches from the work of ancient Greek to modern evolutionary biologists. As a field of science, plant systematics came into being only slowly, early plant lore usually being treated as part of the study of medicine. Later, classification and description was driven by natural history and natural theology. Until the advent of the theory of evolution, nearly all classification was based on the scala naturae. The professionalization of botany in the 18th and 19th century marked a shift toward more holistic classification methods, eventually based on evolutionary relationships. Antiquity The Sushrut (800-1000 BC) (Indian Scholar of ayurveda) first classify plant in 4 categories on basis of flowering pattern structure and life span. (1) vanspataya (2) Vruksha () (3) Virudh (4) Aushodh. The peripatetic philosopher Theophrastus (372‚Äì287 BC), as a student of Aristotle in Ancient Greece, wrote Historia Plantarum, the earliest surviving treatise on plants, where he listed the names of over 500 plant species.Concise Encyclopedia Of Science And Technology, McGraw-Hill He did not articulate a formal classification scheme, but relied on the common groupings of folk taxonomy combined with growth form: tree shrub; undershrub; or herb. The De Materia Medica of Dioscorides was an important early compendium of plant descriptions (over five hundred), classifying plants chiefly by their medicinal effects. Medieval The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII sent a copy of Dioscorides' pharmacopeia to the Ummayad Caliph Abd al-Rahman III who ruled C√≥rdoba in the 9th century, and also sent a monk named Nicolas to translate the book into Arabic. It was in use from its publication in the 1st century until the 16th century, making it one of the major herbals throughout the Middle Ages. The taxonomy criteria of medieval texts is different from what is used today. Plants with similar external appearance were usually grouped under the same species name, though in modern taxonomy they are considered different.Middle East Garden Traditions: Unity and Diversity : Questions, Methods and Resources in a Multicultural Perspective Volume 31 Ab≈´ l-Khayr's botanical workUmdat al-tabib fi ma'rifat al-n abat (Medical support for the knowledge of plants by all experts) is the most complete Andalusi botanical text known to modern scholars. It is noted for its detailed descriptions of plant morphology and phenology. Early modern period In the 16th century, works by Otto Brunfels, Hieronymus Bock, and Leonhart Fuchs helped to revive interest in natural history based on first-hand observation; Bock in particular included environmental and life cycle information in his descriptions. With the influx of exotic species in the Age of Exploration, the number of known species expanded rapidly, but most authors were far more interested in the medicinal properties of individual plants than an overarching classification system. Later influential Renaissance books include those of Caspar Bauhin and Andrea Cesalpino. Bauhin described over 6000 plants, which he arranged into 12 books and 72 sections based on a wide range of common characteristics. Cesalpino based his system on the structure of the organs of fructification, using the Aristotelian technique of logical division. In the late 17th century, the most influential classification schemes were those of English botanist and natural theologian John Ray and French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. Ray, who listed over 18,000 plant species in his works, is credited with establishing the monocot/dicot division and some of his groups ‚Äî mustards, mints, legumes and grasses ‚Äî stand today (though under modern family names). Tournefort used an artificial system based on logical division which was widely adopted in France and elsewhere in Europe up until Linnaeus. The book that had an enormous accelerating effect on the science of plant systematics was Species Plantarum (1753) by Linnaeus. It presented a complete list of the plant species then known to Europe, ordered for the purpose of easy identification using the number and arrangement of the male and female sexual organs of the plants. Of the groups in this book, the highest rank that continues to be used today is the genus. The consistent use of binomial nomenclature along with a complete listing of all plants provided a huge stimulus for the field. Although meticulous, the classification of Linnaeus served merely as an identification manual; it was based on phenetics and did not regard evolutionary relationships among species. It assumed that plant species were given by God and that what remained for humans was to recognise them and use them (a Christian reformulation of the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being). Linnaeus was quite aware that the arrangement of species in the Species Plantarum was not a natural system, i.e. did not express relationships. However he did present some ideas of plant relationships elsewhere. Modern and Contemporary periods Significant contributions to plant classification came from de Jussieu (inspired by the work of Michel Adanson) in 1789 and the early nineteenth century saw the start of work by de Candolle, culminating in the Prodromus. A major influence on plant systematics was the theory of evolution (Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859), resulting in the aim to group plants by their phylogenetic relationships. To this was added the interest in plant anatomy, aided by the use of the light microscope and the rise of chemistry, allowing the analysis of secondary metabolites. Currently, the strict use of epithets in botany, although regulated by international codes, is considered unpractical and outdated. The very notion of species, the fundamental classification unit, is often up to subjective intuition and thus can not be well defined. As a result, estimate of the total number of existing \\"species\\" (ranging from 2 million to 100 million) becomes a matter of preference. While scientists have agreed for some time that a functional and objective classification system must reflect actual evolutionary processes and genetic relationships, the technological means for creating such a system did not exist until recently. In the 1990s DNA technology saw immense progress, resulting in unprecedented accumulation of DNA sequence data from various genes present in compartments of plant cells. In 1998 a ground-breaking classification of the angiosperms (the APG system) consolidated molecular phylogenetics (and especially cladistics or phylogenetic systematics) as the best available method. For the first time relatedness could be measured in real terms, namely similarity of the molecules comprising the genetic code.

It is informally named for its similarity in shape to a baseball home plate. Home Plate is a rocky outcrop that appears to show layered features. The plateau has been extensively studied by Spirit, one of the Mars Exploration Rovers, since 2006. The rover became stuck in loose granular material alongside the northeast side of the plateau. The rover last communicated with Earth on March 22, 2010. Exploration Spirit arrived at Home Plate on sol 744 (February 7, 2006) and has completed a scientific investigation with her robotic arm before moving to Low Ridge Haven due to power concerns. She returned on sol 1126 to resume those studies. Spirit spent her third Martian winter on Home Plate's north edge. Origins Scientists now believe that Home Plate is an explosive volcanic deposit. It is surrounded by deposits of basalt, which are believed to have exploded on contact with water. The presence of brine is further supported by the high concentration of chloride ions in the surrounding rocks. The presence of bomb sags (laminae typically found in beds of volcanish ash) seems to confirm this hypothesis. A patch of 90% pure opaline silicon dioxide was unearthed by Spirit in the vicinity of Home Plate. The patch is believed to be formed in acidic hydrothermal conditions, which supports the theory that Home Plate is of an explosive volcanic origin. Water is also present as mineral hydrates. Since 2008, scientists believe that this formation is an example of an eroded, ancient, and extinct fumarole.The Hydrothermal System at Home Plate in Gusev Crater, Mars, R.V.Morris, S.W.Squyres, -et al., Lunar & Planetary Science XXXIX(2008) Gallery File:Home plate.JPG|Spirit imager moves towards Home Plate.

Plot introduction In late 1963, Mary 'Mouse' Bradford is sent to boarding school by her unsympathetic father and jealous stepmother. There, she meets the rebellious Paulie, and together they embark upon a quest to discover what, fundamentally, separates men from women. Explanation of the novel's title In Swan's own words, \\"... the teachers and matrons of the boarding school remind [Mouse] of Chaucer's Wife of Bath because they are the only women she has met who live by their own rules. Yet even their power is limited, and Mouse concludes near the end of the novel: Plot summary =Part one= Mouse introduces herself, and mentions her involvement in Paulie's \\"weird, Napoleonic act of self-assertion\\", though she does not specify exactly what it was that Paulie did, or even who she is. Mouse speaks of her distracted father, Morley, and her critical stepmother, Sal. She also tells the reader of the hump she has in her left shoulder as a result of a childhood bout of polio, which developed into kyphosis. Mouse has named the hump Alice, after her dead mother, and says that the hump is like a friend to her. Throughout the novel, Mouse's conversations with Alice provide comic relief and exposition on the story's dark events. In the second chapter, Mouse pauses the narrative and recounts details from Paulie's trial, something she continues to do sporadically throughout the novel. It emerges that Paulie committed a murder of some kind. Mouse recalls how she was sent to the boarding school in Toronto- Bath Ladies' College- because her father had \\"an unfortunate inferiority complex about bringing up females\\" and because its headmistress, Vera Vaughan, was a distant cousin of Morley's. Mouse is nervous, keenly aware of her shyness and her physical shortcomings, and is bewildered by the strange atmosphere of the old-fashioned school. She meets the friendly janitor, Sergeant (who is a dwarf), and Paulie's brother, Lewis, whom she later catches shaving in her new dorm bathroom. Mouse meets Tory and Paulie that evening, immediately warming to the friendly Tory and taken aback by Paulie's brash manner. It is clear that, different as they are, the two have a very close friendship. Tory tells Mouse that Paulie's brother, Lewis, is her boyfriend, and that they are in love. Mouse settles quickly, but not comfortably, into the school, picking up the lexicon and the consensus regarding the staff of the school amongst the students. The intensity of her fixation with John F. Kennedy is evident in the long, familiar letters that she sends him on a regular basis. To both Mouse and Paulie's chagrin, Tory breaks her leg in a field hockey accident and is sent home for the rest of the winter term. Tiring of Paulie's volatile behaviour, Miss Vaughan orders Paulie to 'walk off' her frustrations at the school every evening after class, and assigns Mouse to accompany her. The two form a kind of bond, and Paulie soon reveals to Mouse that she doesn't have a brother named Lewis; it is actually her, masquerading as a boy, and that she has everyone fooled, even Tory. She takes Mouse to the shrine she has made to the 1933 film King Kong, and sets Mouse a series of bizarre tests to prove that she, too, can 'be' a boy. These include: eating six bowls of tapioca pudding without vomiting, letting a match burn to the skin without crying, and managing to urinate whilst standing up. After Mouse completes these 'preliminaries', she embarks upon three major tests: mastery over other men, mastery over women and mastery over nature; in the first, Mouse creates her male alter-ego 'Nick the Greek', and dresses as a boy for the first time. Mouse and Paulie pick a fight with boys from the nearby King's College, one of whom is Tory's elder brother, Rick. In the second, Paulie challenges Mouse to seduce an overweight girl from the local convent school, which she does, though the outcome borders on comical; the girl in question, Josie, is found to have known all along that 'Nick' was a girl, and bursts into tears when Mouse hesitates to caress her. In the third test, Paulie challenges Mouse to kill a pigeon. Mouse's reluctance to do these tasks emphasises that her wish to be a man is not founded on a genuine desire to become one, or even on an attraction to girls. Rather, Mouse longs for the freedom that the men of the time enjoyed, which she believes she will never be able to experience as a woman. In Tory's absence, teacher's pet Ismay Thom moves into Mouse and Paulie's dorm room. Her pushy presence aggravates Paulie, but Mouse warms to Ismay's eccentric but likeable character. Paulie leads Mouse in a break-in to Mrs Peddie's private quarters, where they stumble upon correspondence between Miss Vaughan and Mrs Peddie, written years before. The letters detail an incident in which Miss Vaughan was assaulted by a police officer, who had seen her kissing Mrs Peddie. Paulie steals them, and hides them in Mouse's bedside drawer. When Mouse checks on them in the morning, they have disappeared. In Tory's absence, Paulie's behaviour worsens, and she is banned from attending the Visitor's Luncheon at King's College. Mouse is taken there by her Uncle Winnie (her mother's brother) and his wife. Whilst there, she sees Tory with Lewis in the yard outside. Lewis is chased from the school, after being seen vandalising a statue. Amidst the uproar, the news is broken that President Kennedy has been assassinated. Mouse is devastated by the news of the President's death, but is cheered by letters from Jack O'Malley, a King's College student she met at the Luncheon. Paulie's behaviour becomes increasingly sinister; she instructs Mouse to beat her with an old cane, and when she hesitates, Paulie beats her with it instead, hard enough to draw blood. Mouse admits that she continued to go along with Paulie's tests because Paulie's evil character absolves her of all the things in her life that she cannot change (i.e., not being worthy of Morley's love, not having any friends) and makes her even more innocent. After performing in the Christmas show, Mouse is summoned to Miss Vaughan's office, where she is told that Morley has died from a sudden heart attack. =Part two= Mouse returns to her home in Madoc's Landing to bury her father. Though she seems cold and distant to the reality of his death, it is obvious that she is devastated. Her stepmother Sal, who is frequently heard as Mouse's voice of conscience, is revealed to be an alcoholic. Miss Vaughan attends the funeral, bringing Paulie, who tells Mouse that Rick is trying to stop Tory from seeing Lewis. Miss Vaughan asks Mouse to keep what she has discovered in her and Mrs Peddie's letters to herself. Mouse resolves to never dress as a boy again, and meditates on her father's lack of affection for her. She concludes that he loved his work too much. Mouse returns to Bath College with keepsakes of his, one of them being a book on anatomy (he was a surgeon) and his old doctor's bag. =Part three= On returning to school, Mouse discovers that Paulie has been removed from her dorm room, replaced by Asa Abrams, and that Tory has returned. To her surprise, she receives quiet sympathy from her peers as well as her teachers, and is particularly touched by Tory's gift of a New Testament bible. Paulie has been forced to take Asa's old cubicle. Her exile makes her noticeably friendlier to Mouse. Paulie discloses that she (as Lewis) got into a fight with Rick and injured him with a knife, and that Tory was upset with her for doing it. Ismay tells Mouse that Paulie has been carving lurid stick figures on her bedstead and stealing her music scores, which Paulie laughingly denies. Lewis drives Mouse to King's College on the evening of the Christmas dance, to pick up Jack O'Malley. The two make awkward conversation as Lewis drives to Canon Quinn's house to pick Tory up. Mouse sees Rick and Lewis arguing and scuffling at the door of the Quinns' house; Lewis returns to the van noticeably upset and without Tory. Once alone, Lewis reveals to Mouse that Rick had challenged Lewis to prove he was a boy by showing him his penis, and begins to cry. Mouse eventually leaves Paulie, and joins Jack inside. They become involved in the festivities, drinking gin and \\"fooling around for the longest time standing up\\". Toward the end of the evening, Mouse breaks away and searches for Paulie, finally finding her in the tower washroom, her hair shorn and her face cut and bleeding. Paulie angrily brushes Mouse away when she tries to comfort her, and says that she's not giving up on Tory. They are distracted by Sergeant, who has dressed up as the school's dead founder, Miss Higgs, for the evening, and is tearing round the school on an antiquated Victorian bicycle. The girls try to follow him, but Mouse loses Paulie in the darkness. She looks for her in her room, and discovers Ismay's musical scores in there, along with pages ripped from her father's Gray's Anatomy; the pages depict the male penis, and have been annotated by Paulie. Tired, and tipsy from the alcohol Jack gave her, Mouse goes to bed. Mouse wakes early the next morning and, worried by Paulie's prolonged absence, goes to look for her in the tunnels beneath the school. She finds Paulie distressed, saying that Sergeant has fallen against one of the heating pipes and hurt himself. She takes Mouse to his prone body, then sends her to get the Czech groundskeeper, Willy. Sergeant is unconscious, and badly burned from falling against the scalding pipes. When Mouse returns with him, she finds Sergeant dead, and Paulie gone. Remembering what she found the evening before, a horrified Mouse suspects what Paulie has done. Lifting his costume skirts, Mouse sees that Sergeant has been castrated. Mouse recalls details from Paulie's trial, and informs the reader what happened next; after removing Sergeant's genitals with one of Morley's scalpels, Paulie had stuck them to herself with tire glue, and presented herself to Rick Quinn in her chilling garb. She was arrested shortly after, and found to be too mentally unstable to take full responsibility for her actions; eluding jail, Paulie was sent to a mental institution for \\"rehabilitation\\". Tory was sent to another school (though the court heard that she continued to see Paulie whilst she was in custody), and Mouse was sent home to Madoc's Landing until the furor over her involvement in Paulie's crime had died down. She recalls a dream she had about Sergeant after his memorial service, and says she's glad that he didn't know it was not his friend Lewis who had killed him, but Paulie. Now sixteen, Mouse looks back on her time at Bath's College, crediting the girls and women there who inspired her to be herself, and signs herself off as 'M.B.' Characters in The Wives of Bath =Main characters= Mary Beatrice 'Mouse' Bradford Deep-thinking, shy and intelligent. Mouse's adoration of her father, Morley, and her idolization of John F. Kennedy suggests that she, like Paulie, longs for the freedom and status of becoming a man. However, when presented with confrontational situations that test her 'masculinity', Mouse's 'feminine' instincts (i.e. passivity, fear and obedience) take precedence. Pauline 'Paulie' Sykes/Lewis Rebellious, troubled and wild. Paulie resents the status females have been given by society, and constantly challenges one to consider exactly what it is that makes a man characteristically 'masculine', (i.e. strong, self-assured, and resourceful). Paulie finds a freedom in masquerading as a boy. Though mainly unsympathetic and at times even violent toward Mouse, Paulie harbours an idealistic and devoted love for Tory. The horrific murder Paulie commits at the climax of the novel acts as the d√©nouement for the story. Victoria 'Tory' Quinn Kind, beautiful and vulnerable, Tory could be described as being acceptably 'feminine'. Though not as subversive as Paulie, Tory is rebellious in her own way. She frequently breaks school rules, and does not respond seriously to discipline when she doesn't manage to evade it. Most importantly, the nature of her relationship with Paulie prevents her from being described as a typical girl of the time. Mouse questions, toward the end of the novel, whether Tory was aware that Lewis and Paulie were the same person; there is evidence for both arguments, but the intensity of their relationship suggests that she was. =Other characters= *Vera 'The Virgin' Vaughan *Mrs Peddie *Morley Bradford *Sal Bradford *Sergeant *Richard 'Rick' Quinn *Ismay Thom Major themes, symbols and motifs *Gender issues and stereotypes *Repressive atmosphere of the 1960s *Forbidden love *Freudian/Psychoanalytic theories of sexuality and gender identity *King Kong as a masculine hero Allusions/references to other works/authors *Geoffrey Chaucer's The Wife of Bath *Charlotte Bront√´'s criticism of Jane Austen *The character and suicide of Virginia Woolf Allusions/references to actual history and current science *The assassination of President John F.

Susan Swan has recently written a foreword for the new edition of The Wives of Bath praising Lost and Delirious, though she states that it is, superficially, \\"vastly different\\" from the original novel.

The murder that serves as the d√©nouement for the story was not included in the Lost and Delirious screenplay by Judith Thompson, who felt that the grotesque nature of Paulie's crime would not translate properly on-screen.

History =Rwandan Genocide= The site was closed down during the genocide and civil war in Rwanda when most of the workers became refugees in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). Most Karisoke trackers lost their homes and possessions in the war, and some saw family members murdered. Some were imprisoned when they returned home. Rwandan staff continued to monitor the gorillas during this period whenever possible. By 1998 Karisoke‚Äôs expatriate staff had evacuated five times. The facility was destroyed three times, rebuilt twice, and eventually relocated to Musanze (formerly Ruhengeri). Despite the constant threat of war, Karisoke continued to upgrade its capacity for scientific research through new technology and new partnerships with local authorities and other conservation organizations. The gorillas survived the war years in good condition, despite the greatly increased number of snares set by poachers. The buildings, now in ruins and overgrown by vegetation, are still a monument to Fossey, her work and the first camp dedicated exclusively to the study of mountain gorillas. The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund continues to operate the Karisoke Research Center, from its Regional Research Center headquarters in Musanze. =Current= Thanks to Karisoke Research Center's active conservation program, the mountain gorillas of the Virungas are the only great ape species to have increased in number in recent decades. Karisoke conducts extensive daily protection and monitoring of the mountain gorillas, numerous science and research projects, various education initiatives, and community health and development projects. Since its establishment in 1967, Karisoke has produced an unparalleled amount of information about the mountain gorillas and their habitat and attracts scientists and science students from around the world. Karisoke is also a significant resource for the people who live near the gorillas, employing more than 100 staff members, the great majority of whom are Rwandan. Over half of these are involved in research, protection, and monitoring of the gorillas. Others are engaged in biodiversity and socioeconomic research, education, health, and administration. In addition, Karisoke provides the human communities in the area with education, health, and economic development programs. Staff members provide conservation education to primary and secondary school students and to adult community members through a variety of media. The Fossey Fund supports and has helped renovate schools and a health clinic near the park and supports clean water, parasite treatment, and prevention programs that reduce transmission of disease from people to gorillas as well as improving the quality of life for the communities. Ellen DeGeneres plans to help build a permanent home in Rwanda for the work of the Fossey Fund to protect critically endangered mountain gorillas. The Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Fossey Gorilla Fund is to be a permanent, specially designed facility for scientists who are helping to save mountain gorillas.

The League of Lezh√´, led by Skanderbeg, experienced low morale after losing Svetigrad and Berat between 1448 and 1450. Nevertheless, Skanderbeg's exhortations and the support of the clergy, who claimed to have had visions of angels and victory, motivated the Albanians to defend the capital of the League, Kruj√´, at all costs. After leaving a protective garrison of 4,000 men under his trusted lieutenant Vrana Konti (also known as Kont Urani), Skanderbeg harassed the Ottoman camps around Kruj√´ and attacked the supply caravans of Sultan Murad II's army. By September the Ottoman camp was in disarray as morale sank and disease ran rampant. The Ottoman army acknowledged that the castle of Kruj√´ would not fall by strength of arms, lifted the siege, and made its way to Edirne. Soon thereafter, in the winter of 1450‚Äì51, Murad died in Edirne and was succeeded by his son, Mehmed II. Campaigns of 1448 and early 1450 After several failed invasions of Albania by Ottoman captains, Murad II laid siege to the fortress of Svetigrad (which is thought to be today's Demir Hisar) on May 14, 1448, with a force of 80,000 men.Francione p. 77. Svetigrad was an important strategic point, since it controlled the routes from Macedonia into Albania.Hodgkinson p. 95. The small garrison, composed of Albanians, Bulgarians, and other Europeans, held the fortress while Scanderbeg attacked the Ottoman camp from outside. After the Ottomans poisoned the wells, a group of defenders decided to open the gates and let the Turks in, thus giving control of the fortress to the Ottomans.Hodgkinson p. 102.Francione p. 80. The Sultan retired from Albania and Skanderbeg laid siege to Svetigrad on September 23, 1448. After several failed assaults, Skanderbeg lifted the siege and retreated.Francione p. 81. In early 1450, Berat was captured by the pasha of Gjirokast√´r through a night attack, causing Gjergj Arianit to desert Skandebeg's cause.Francione pp. 82‚Äì83. Prelude =Albanian morale before the siege= The morale of the Albanians sank after the losses in the previous years. When the Turks began marching towards Kruj√´ on April 5, 1450, the people claimed to have seen cherubims and angels flying over Albania.Francione p. 85. Skanderbeg himself claimed that he had received a vision of St. George handing him a flaming sword to \\"destroy the enemies of true religion (Christianity).\\"Francione p. 86. This speech, along with many other visions of the clergy, raised Albanians' morale, motivating them to fight. =Albanian dispositions and preparations= Before the siege began, Skanderbeg exited Kruj√´ with 8,000 men‚Äîamong whom were many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen, and Germans.Setton p. 101. 2,000 of these were infantry and 6,000 were cavalry. Skanderbeg found Mount Tumenishta (now known as Mount Sk√´nderbeu) to be a suitable position from which to attack the Ottomans. Kruj√´ was left with a garrison of 4,000 men under the command of Vrana Konti. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also ordered them to their positions.Hodgkinson p. 108. Kruj√´ had enough supplies for a sixteen-month siege. The women and children of Kruj√´ were sent for protection to Venetian possessed cities, whereas the others were ordered to burn their crops and move into the mountains and fortresses.Mount Tumenishta (Skenderbeu) as seen from Fush√´ Kruj√´ =Ottoman dispositions and preparations= Murad reached Kruj√´ on May 14 with approximately 100,000 of his best soldiers (60,000 of which was cavalryGibbon p. 465.) . Murad proposed to Vrana that he should hand over the fortress, but Vrana refused. After receiving the refusal, Murad set his army to cast ten cannons, one of which could fire rocks weighing 400 pounds and another 200 pounds.Hodgkinson p. 109.Setton p. 101. Despite the firepower, the Turkish firing positions were at a disadvantage, since Kruj√´ \\"was almost part of the mountain which it had been built.\\" The cannons could fire two or three times a day and were not accurate. Two large and four smaller guns were placed on the Tirana side, and the remainder were aimed at the main gateway. Siege Ottoman Janissaries during a siege. =First phase= Murad fired on Kruj√´ for four days until a breach was finally made. The Sultan believed that he had the advantage and ordered his troops through the walls. The garrison managed to push the assault back, thus gaining time to repair the walls. Murad, fearing a counterattack from Skanderbeg, sent a scouting patrol towards the surrounding mountains to watch for an attack. Skanderbeg still managed to lead, at dusk, a raid on the Turkish encampment, killing several hundred men, capturing and destroying Turkish supplies, and almost losing his own life. When Skanderbeg returned to his men, his \\"shield was so battered that its shape was scarce to be discerned.\\" The raid cost Skanderbeg ten dead and even more wounded. The assault continued however, with the guns sounding from time to time. The defenders were not facing great difficulty, however. Sixty of them sallied forth to do whatever damage they could, and those at the walls repelled all attempts to enter. The main weight of the attack had come from the Tirana side, where the Turkish losses had been heavy.Hodgkinson p. 110. =Second phase= Moisi Arianit Golemi When the second assault began, the Turks tried to break through the gate with their lances. After heavy casualties, the attackers retreated and Murad held for the next two days a council of all his generals. An immediate precaution was to guard the camp against another surprise attack, which was responded to by placing a force of men, under the command of Prince Mehmed, where the first attack had taken place. Moisi Arianit Golemi feigned an attack with about 500 horsemen: the alarm was given and the Turks prepared for his attack. Meanwhile, Skanderbeg and his forces moved around the camp and broke in where least expected. Before an organized counterattack could be made, Skanderbeg retreated from the camp. The attacks made by Skanderbeg caused the Turks to aim some of their cannons towards the expected guerrilla forces, instead of the fortress. A large force of Turkish cavalry was sent out, which Skanderbeg followed up to the mouth of the Ish√´m River, until they turned back to Kruj√´.Hodgkinson p. 111. While Skanderbeg had been away, a large Ottoman assault was made on Kruj√´ from the Tirana side, but inadvertent friendly fire from the Turks forced them to call off the assault. The Ottomans then attempted to mine the fortress, but could not succeed, since the fortress had been built on rock. Since the food supplies were beginning to run out, the Turks received provisions from Venice, as did the Albanians.Hodgkinson p. 112.Francione p. 91 The Turkish attacks had made no headway and the Ottoman army had lost many dead or wounded, whereas Skanderbeg's force had lost 1,000 men thus far. Moisi Golemi and Tanush Thopia raised a couple thousand more and the force was split between the three, making attacks on the Turkish camp easier. Skanderbeg began to move towards the camp as the Turks had assembled 8,000 men which began to move towards him. Skanderbeg slowly retired, while Moisi and Tanush broke into the camp. The Turkish force sent against Skanderbeg was lured towards the foothills and the next morning (July 25) they were surrounded and completely destroyed.Francione p. 90. The next day, Skanderbeg was seen above the rocks of Kruj√´, in conference with Vrana Konti, surprising Murad.Hodgkinson p. 113. =Final phase= After Vrana had returned to the castle, a pasha was chosen to have a conference with Vrana bringing him many rich presents. The pasha tried to convince the count that Murad would be a more suitable master than Skanderbeg was, and that the siege was almost over, but Vrana refused to surrender. As a result, a fresh Ottoman assault began. Meanwhile, Murad sent an envoy trying to convince Skanderbeg to capitulate by offering 10,000 crowns annually. Skanderbeg also refused replying: \\"Nay if Murad did divide with me and make me co-partner with all his empire, I would never suffer the name of Albania to be stained and blemished with this blot of disgrace and infamy.\\" The assault continued, and the Albanian positions seemed desperate. On October 14, Skanderbeg offered Kruj√´ to the Venetians, threatening to capitulate the fortress to the Turks if they did not accept it. After Murad lifted the siege on October 26, because of the arriving winter, the Venetians replied to Skanderbeg's offer rejecting it and offered to help Skanderbeg to harmonize his relationship with Ottomans.Hodgkinson p. 114.Francione p. 92. Aftermath Skanderbeg's helmet on display in Vienna. The siege cost 20,000 Ottoman casualties and over 1,000 Albanian casualties. Marin Barleti claims that Murad died of disease under the fortress of Kruj√´,Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis by Marin Barleti. but Murad in fact died in Edirne in 1451.Gibbon p. 465, note 42. Murad began to retire from Albania out of fear of losing even more men from the Albanian winter,Housley p. 90. however the retreat itself caused the loss of thousands of Ottoman troops due to attacks from local Albanian militias.Francione p. 93. Skanderbeg was at the end of his resources. He travelled to Ragusa, urging for assistance, and the Ragusans informed Pope Nicholas V. Through financial assistance, Skanderbeg managed to hold Kruj√´ and regain much of his territory. Skanderbeg's success brought praise from all over Europe and ambassadors were sent to him from Rome, Naples, Hungary, and Burgundy.Setton p. 102. Skanderbeg then became a vassal of Alfonso V, on March 26, 1451, by the Treaty of Gaeta, gaining much needed men and supplies from the crown of Aragon. According to legend, one night during the siege Skanderbeg sent out a herd of goats with a candle on each of the goats' horns. The encamped Turks believed it to be an Albanian attack and made a movement against the herd. When the Turks advanced far enough, Skanderbeg launched an attack against the force, destroying it. After the siege was lifted, Skanderbeg commemorated his victory by designing a helmet with the head of a goat on it, as a reference to his \\"ingenious tactics\\" used that night. Popular culture and legacy Naim Frash√´ri, a prominent Albanian poet, wrote of how the siege of Kruj√´ had saved Europe from Ottoman invasion.Histori' e Sk√´nderbeut, by Naim Frash√´ri. Today, Albanians take pride in the actions performed during the siege.

Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire led an army into Albania to defeat Skanderbeg, the leader of the League of Lezh√´, which was created in 1444 after he began his war against the Ottomans. During the almost year-long siege, Skanderbeg's main fortress, Kruj√´, withstood the siege while Skanderbeg roamed Albania to gather forces and facilitate the flight of refugees from the civilian areas that were attacked by the Ottomans. Kruj√´ managed to withstand the siege put on it by Ballaban Badera, sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid, an Albanian brought up in the Ottoman army through the dev≈üirme. By 23 April 1467, the Ottoman army had been defeated and Skanderbeg entered Kruj√´. Mehmed had decided to construct a fortress in what is now Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed on the banks of the Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic and threaten Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where he would try to convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the fear of a Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the time he left Italy, the League of Lezh√´ had been weakened and needed his intervention. After his return the Venetians decided to send troops against the Ottoman advances. Skanderbeg gathered 13,400 men, among whom were many Venetians, to launch an assault on the Ottoman besieging camp, who had taken command once Mehmed left Albania after the construction of Elbasan. Skanderbeg had split his army into three parts and surrounded the besiegers. Ballaban was killed during the fighting and the Ottoman forces were left without a commander and a depleted force which was surrounded. Afterwards the Albanian-Venetian forces completed the rout by killing the remaining Ottoman forces before they could escape by way of Dib√´r. The victory was well received by both Albanians and Italians. This did not signal the end of the war, however, as soon after, Skanderbeg took up some assaults on Elbasan after being urged to by Venice, but was not able to take the fortress due to lack of artillery. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors, which led Mehmed to begin another campaign against the Albanians. This would result in another siege on Kruj√´. Background Mehmed II Skanderbeg Skanderbeg had been an Ottoman sanjakbey, who defected from the empire and united several Albanian princes under the League of Lezh√´. From Kruj√´, his main fort, he led the league in the Ottoman- Albanian wars. Having defeated the Ottomans in many battles he allied with Western Christian states and leaders, especially with Alfonso V of Aragon and the Papal States. On 14 August 1464, Pope Pius II, one of Skanderbeg's major benefactors, died and his plans for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The alliances and promises for help from the major Christian powers were canceled with the exception of the Kingdom of Hungary under Matthias Corvinus and the Republic of Venice. Sultan Mehmed II realized the power vacuum created after Pius died and he tried to take advantage of the situation. He thus attempted to sign a peace agreement with Hungary and Venice so that his forces could focus on Albania to gain a base for future campaigns in the Italian peninsula. His efforts were unsuccessful, however, since neither Venice nor Hungary accepted his proposed treaty. Mehmed thus kept his armies stationed in the Balkans, one force near Jajce in Bosnia, one in Ohrid, and another one in the Morea. Skanderbeg led an incursion into Ottoman territory near Ohrid with the aid of Venetian forces under a condottiero named Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto, on 6 September 1464. Together, they defeated the Ottoman forces under ≈ûeremet bey stationed there on 14 or 15 September. The Venetian Senate informed the Hungarians of the joint Albanian- Venetian success on 29 September. Mehmed, sensing the weakness in his frontier, assigned Ballaban Badera as commander, replacing ≈ûeremet. Ballaban was an Albanian by birth who had been incorporated into the Ottoman army through the dev≈üirme system and was sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1464 and 1465. In the meantime, Pope Paul II began planning his own crusade, but with means different from his predecessor. He planned to get the major European states to help fund the crusade while Venice, Hungary, and Albania would do the fighting. He also wanted to aid the Albanians as much as possible and urged the Kingdom of Naples to supply Skanderbeg with able forces. Venice began to consider peace with the Ottomans since its resources had significantly decreased, while Hungary adopted a defensive strategy, however, pressure from the Pope and Skanderbeg forced them to abort their efforts. The Ottoman-Albanian war continued through 1465 with Ballaban Badera meeting Skanderbeg at Vaikal, Me√ßad, Vaikal again, and Kashari. In the meantime, Mehmed continued to negotiate peace with Hungary and Venice. Skanderbeg found himself isolated during these negotiations, even if they did not succeed, as the conflicting powers temporarily ceased conflict. Furthermore, Ferdinand I of Naples did not send his promised forces and the Venetian forces under Cimarosto left Albania. During the autumn of 1465, Ottoman forces moved from the Morea and Bosnia in order to speed up the peace negotiations. Venice, however, refused peace and Skanderbeg believed that a new Albanian-Venetian campaign would begin. He kept Pal Engj√´lli, his ambassador, in constant correspondence with the Signoria (Venetian Senate), which sent him to Albania to inform Skanderbeg that troops were being raised, although only 300 had been recruited at the time, with Cimarosto as the commander. Venice was also in the process of sending its provveditores in Albania Veneta 3,000 ducats to recruit men. They would also send four cannons, ten springalds, and ten barrels of gunpowder. Throughout April, rumors spread that the Ottomans were preparing to march into Albania. By 18 April 1466, Venice received knowledge that the Ottomans were heading towards Albania. Campaign 350px Once news of the Ottoman approach arrived, Venice sent reinforcements to its cities along Albania; Durazzo (Durr√´s) had already garrisoned 3,000 men. The Scutari Fortress was also reinforced after Skanderbeg's counsel and the walls were rebuilt. On 19 April 1466, news spread that the sultan was going to march into Avlonya (Vlor√´) with an army of 100,000 men although the Ragusans reported that the number was 30,000. Ottoman forces were ready to enter the Kingdom of Naples and pressured Ferdinand to form an alliance with Mehmed. The situation was not clear in the Balkans, however, as it was thought that the Ottomans could march against Bosnia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Negroponte, or Albania. By the beginning of May, however, it was clear that the Ottomans would attack Albania because of the approach of Mehmed's troops towards Albania after the end of his campaigns in Wallachia, Karaman, and the Morea. None of the promised reinforcements from Naples and Venice arrived and Skanderbeg was thus left to fight Ottoman forces only with the league's troops. =Ottoman activities in Albania= News arrived from eastern Albania that the Ottomans had initiated massacres in the area. The pope was distressed by this and called on the Christian princes of Europe to aid Skanderbeg. Soon after, Mehmed's men marched into Albania. Unlike his father Murad II, Mehmed considered that the only way Albania could be conquered would be through isolating Kruj√´, the main Albanian fortress, by reducing Skanderbeg's manpower, supplies, and political and moral backing. Afterwards, Kruj√´ would be put under siege. The Ottoman campaign was thus sent in two directions: one through the Shkumbin River valley and another through the Black Drin River valley. Both fielded men in the frontier regions, right and left of both valleys, and would engage in massacring the local populations, raiding inhabited areas, and burning every village which offered resistance. The populations thus decided to flee into safe areas. Skanderbeg did not expect such a campaign and his army was not ready to halt the advances. According to an act released Monopoli in Apulia, an army of 300,000 soldiers (a figure considered to be exaggerated) had marched into Albania, massacred 7,000 people, and sacked many populated areas, while Skanderbeg was preparing to flee to Italy. However, Skanderbeg had remained in Albania but he had sent twelve ships with many inhabitants of Kruj√´ to Italy as refugees. With them, he sent his wife, Donika, and his son, John. They were headed to Monte Sant'Angelo, a castle awarded to Skanderbeg after his campaigns to restore Ferdinand's rule. The arrival of Albanian refugees further distressed the pope and many Italians who had come to believe that Albania had been conquered and that Mehmed was now preparing to march into Italy. News to the contrary also reached Rome saying that the League of Lezh√´ had not been broken and that Kruj√´ still stood. The League of Lezh√´ saw a massive struggle against Ottoman forces and its front was expanded throughout Albania. Skanderbeg retreated to the mountains surrounding Scutari (Shkod√´r) where he collected men to relieve Kruj√´. Mehmed's akƒ±ncƒ± were allowed to raid the country, a decision which, according to scholar Mehmed Neshriu, was an act of reprisal regarding Skanderbeg's raids in Macedonia in 1464, which interrupted his siege on Jajce. Idris Bitlisi, however, says that Mehmed's campaign was a response to the breaking of the ceasefire in 1463 when Skanderbeg learned that the crusade against the Ottomans organized by Pius II was ready to set off from Ancona. The resistance itself was described by Tursun Bey: the Albanians had gained control of the mountaintops and valleys where they had their kulle (fortified towers) which were dismantled when captured; those inside, especially the young men and women, were sold to slavery for 3,000‚Äì4,000 ak√ße each. Michael Critobulus, a Greek historian for the sultan, also describes the resistance and its aftermath. The Albanians in his chronicle had likewise gained the mountaintops; the light Ottoman infantry climbed up the heights where they cornered the Albanians behind a cliff and fell on them. Many Albanians jumped from the cliffs to escape massacre. The soldiers then spread throughout the mountains and captured many as slaves while also taking anything of value. Furthermore, in order to secure future marches into Albania, Mehmed ordered forests through which the main roads ran through to be cut down. In this way, he created wide military roads which were secure. =Siege= The first phase of the Ottoman campaign to isolate Kruj√´ lasted for two months. According to Marin Barleti, Skanderbeg's main biographer, Skanderbeg had placed 4,400 men under Tanush Thopia as defenders of the castle. This force included 1,000 Venetian infantry under Baldassare Perducci and 200 Neapolitan marksmen. Skanderbeg removed his men from the fortress of Kruj√´ in a manner similar to the first siege. Mehmed had marched into Albania with Ballaban Badera under his command. He offered rewards to the garrison if they surrendered, but the garrison responded by bombarding the Ottoman positions. The Ottomans then began to heavily bombard the fortress but this came to no effect. According to documentary sources, the siege began in mid-June, one month after Mehmed began his campaign to force the eastern regions of Albania into submission. Mehmed's campaigns there had put Skanderbeg under massive strain while the latter had yet to receive financial aid from abroad. In the beginning of July, Skanderbeg sent Pal Engj√´lli to Venice. On 7 July, Engj√´lli informed the Venetians that the League of Lezh√´ continued and Kruj√´ still stood, contrary to rumors that said otherwise. He thus requested the arrival of promised Venetian forces when they signed a treaty of alliance on 20 August 1463 and the promised contribution of 3,000 ducats. The Venetians responded that they were already in a difficult situation due to the Ottoman threat in Dalmatia and the Aegean where they possessed territories. They also responded that they had had difficulty recruiting new soldiers due to financial trouble and could only send 1,000 ducats to its provveditores in Albania. Despite these difficulties, Skanderbeg and his men continued fighting. After becoming convinced that Kruj√´ would not be taken, Mehmed left 18,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry under Ballaban and in June 1466 withdrew with his main army. He withdrew from the siege to Durazzo where he pillaged the area in rage. When Mehmed withdrew from Albania, he deposed Dorotheos, the Archbishop of Ohrid, and expatriated him together with his clerks and boyars and a considerable number of citizens of Ohrid to Istanbul, probably because of their anti-Ottoman activities during Skanderbeg's campaigns since many of them supported Skanderbeg and his fight. He took with him 3,000 Albanian prisoners. =Construction of Elbasan Fortress= The fortress in Elbasan, Albania Despite his inability to subdue Kruj√´, Mehmed decided that the Ottoman presence would not depart from Albania. He organized a timar in eastern Albania to weaken Skanderbeg's domains. The new Ottoman possessions were collected and placed under the administration of the Sanjak of Dibra. He also decided to build a powerful fortress in central Albania to counterbalance Kruj√´'s position and to form a base for further Ottoman campaigns. The fortress would be called Ilbasan (Elbasan). According to Ottoman chronicler Kemal Pashazade, the sultan would place several hundred men to patrol the area and defend the fortress. The foundations were built upon a field called Jundi, located in a Shkumbin valley, where the geographic conditions were regarded as favorable. Since the resources had been gathered and stored beforehand, Elbasan was built within a short time (one month) and Franz Babinger believes the work to have begun in July. Critobulus, who accompanied Mehmed in this campaign, describes that the men stationed in Elbasan would constantly harass the Albanians, to leave them no place for refuge, and to repel any Albanian force which descended from the mountains. Due to his personal guidance, Mehmed was able to see the construction finish before the summer ended. There would also be inhabitants inside to serve the 400 soldiers stationed there along with cannons and catapults; the fortress would be under the command of Ballaban Badera. The personal care and attention Mehmed paid to Elbasan's construction testifies its importance in the sultan's plans. This is further testified by the message Mehmed gave to his son, the future Bayezid II, describing how he had devastated the country and at its center built a powerful fortress. Upon his exit from Albania, Marin Barleti says that Mehmed passed through Dibra and massacred 8,000 people, a figure close to the number given by the Ottoman chronicler Oruc ben Adil of 7,500. The importance of the fortress was further underscored by its position on the ancient Via Egnatia and its central position in the Shkumbin valley from where the Ottomans could travel to the coast. Elbasan concerned not only the Albanians, but also the Venetians, who considered its proximity to Durazzo () alarmant. On 16 August, around the time that the building of Elbasan was completed, Venice urged its proveditors in Albania to cooperate with the Italian and native forces in their proposed siege on Elbasan. Venetian faith in Skanderbeg began to subside, however, since the sultan took a much more aggressive approach in his relations with Venice. Since the Signoria still had not delivered its promised aid, Skanderbeg sent his son John to Venice. Even though the war was at its apogee, John returned from Venice empty-handed. This forced Skanderbeg to look towards Rome and Naples for aid. Skanderbeg in Rome Skanderbeg's portrait above the entrance to the palace where he stayed in Rome During October 1466, Skanderbeg travelled to Italy to reach an agreement with Ferdinand of Naples and Pope Paul II over the provisions, which they would be willing to provide. As a result of the inter-Italian rivalries, the possibility of a crusade was abandoned. Since Paul was Venetian, Ferdinand was also worried that his interests could be inhibited by the pope and eventually he didn't send any resources to Skanderbeg until disagreements with his neighbors were resolved. Thus, Skanderbeg departed from Naples without any definitive agreement on the aid that would be provided by Napes. Venice offered the same and Skanderbeg went to Paul after the latter had declared that the Christian League had raised 100,000 ducats for the planned crusade. Skanderbeg reached Rome on 12 December 1466 where he was greeted by the cardinals and their families. Here they received the impression of Skanderbeg as a poor old man, dressed as an ordinary soldier. He was offered residence in Palazzo di San Marco, in what is now called Piazza Venezia but refused it and instead wanted to stay with another Albanian whose house later took the name Palazzo Scanderbeg. He was greeted by Italian ambassadors from the various states who offered \\"aid and favors\\" and by several bishops and prelates. Paul, however, was still wary of giving Skanderbeg aid because he reasoned that the Neapolitan threat was more powerful than the Ottoman one. Unlike his predecessors, Paul never attempted to form a crusade against the Ottomans and instead preferred the use of pacification methods. Nevertheless, Skanderbeg continued to stay in Rome, hoping that Paul would allocate part of his funds (of about 500,000 ducats) to Albania. Paul asserted to Skanderbeg that Venice's refusal to cooperate with him prevented him from directly helping Skanderbeg. Thus, Skanderbeg was sent to the Signoria to negotiate their stance. During the last weeks of the year in Albania, there was no fighting since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Kruj√´ was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By 22 November, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow to come to terms with Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lek√´ Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and referred to him as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but he explained that he was waiting to see what Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in order not to waste funds. Skanderbeg's view of the situation worsened with news coming from Albania, which strengthened his opinion that his time in Italy was becoming more and more irrational. His pessimism grew once he found out that Venice was now pressuring Paul into refusing Skanderbeg aid since they wished to put an end to the war and capitulate Kruj√´. During the first days of February, news arrived from the Republic of Ragusa that the campaign was nearing its end and that if the necessary actions were not brought up to speed, Albania would fall along with Venice's possessions. Skanderbeg's requests for proper aid were continually rejected on the basis that Italy's peace must first be secured and instead Paul ordered Ferdinand to award to Skanderbeg what tribute would have been given to Rome. Skanderbeg lost all hope and decided to return to Albania before pleas from several cardinals convinced to stay, offering aid from their own pockets and hope in persuading Paul. A third consistory was convened on 13 February 1467 which, like the other two, came to nothing regarding aid to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg thus began his departure from Rome. Paul met with Skanderbeg and gave him the authority to pull 7,500 ducats from Ferdinand's aforementioned tribute to Rome. This amount had not been gathered, however, and Paul thus offered Skanderbeg 2,300 ducats. Skanderbeg departed from Rome on 14 February and soon received news from Albania: the war was nearing its end and needed Skanderbeg to return; an Ottoman force sent to defeat the League of Lezh√´ definitively, however, had been defeated. He met with Giosafat Barbaro in Scutari, the Venetian provveditore in Albania Veneta, where he gathered help from Venetian nobles. Final battles The defeat of the Ottoman forces showed that the League of Lezh√´ had yet to be fully defeated. This allowed Skanderbeg to visit Ferdinand before his departure from Italy, but he received only 1,000 ducats, 300 carts of grain, and 500 ducats to support Kruj√´'s munitions. While Skanderbeg was in his court, Ferdinand received an ambassador from Mehmed offering peace, signaling that the Ottomans did not have any aggressive intentions towards Naples. Ferdinand accepted the proposal and Skanderbeg thus began his return to Albania. Ballaban continued to strengthen the siege against Kruj√´. Upon returning to Albania, the political situation began to change. The once distant Albanian nobles, among them Dukagjini, were now convinced of their impending defeat and allied themselves with Skanderbeg. Meanwhile, the Venetians ended their attempts to negotiate peace with Mehmed and accepted cooperation with Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg met with Dukagjini and other northern Albanian nobles in Alessio (Lezh√´) where they gathered an army to assault Ballaban's forces. Together with 400 of Dukagjini's cavalry and a large number of infantry, 600 heavily armed Italian soldiers, and 4,000 locals from Durazzo, Scutari, Alessio, Drivast (Drisht), and Antivari (Bar), Skanderbeg commanded 13,400 men to relieve Kruj√´ as reported by Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's primary biographers and personal associates, who also served in Skanderbeg's ranks. Among those who joined Skanderbeg was Nicolo Moneta, a lord of Scutari and wealthy Venetian patrician. Ballaban's camp was located on the hills southwest of Kruj√´ and at the bottom of the mountain nowadays known as Mt. Sarisallt√´k, he placed a guarding force. The rest of his army surrounded Kruj√´. Skanderbeg and his allies marched through the mouth of the Mat River and cut through the woods of Jonima to the boundaries of Kruj√´. Skanderbeg's commanders were assigned different groups for an assault on the main Ottoman camp: northern Albanian forces would be put under Dukagjini's command, Venetian battalions were under the command of Moneta, and Skanderbeg's most trusted forces would be assigned to another group under his command; Kruj√´'s garrison would continue to defend the fortress. Moneta's and Dukagjini's men would attack the besieging forces from the north and Skanderbeg's men would attack from south of Kruj√´ while also blocking any possible Ottoman reinforcements from the east. Skanderbeg first assaulted the guarding force which Ballaban had left and he gained control of this strategic point. Skanderbeg then managed to defeat the Ottoman relief forces under Ballaban's brother, Jonuz, and captured him and his son. Four days later, an organized attack from Skanderbeg and the forces from Kruj√´ was carried during which Ballaban forces retreated and he himself was killed in the resulting clashes by Gjergj Lleshi (Georgius Alexius). Map of south-eastern Europe in 1464 AD With the death of Ballaban, Ottoman forces were left surrounded and according to Bernandino de Geraldinis, a Neapolitan functionary, 10,000 men remained in the besieging camp. Those inside the encirclement asked to leave freely to Ottoman territory, offering to surrender all that was within the camp to the Albanians. Skanderbeg was prepared to accept, but many nobles refused. Among them was Dukagjini, who wanted to attack and destroy the Turkish camp. Demetrio Franco described Dukagjini's proposal with the Albanian word Embetha which in modern Albanian means Mb√´ ta or in English Upon them. The Albanians thus began to annihilate the surrounded army before the Ottomans cut a narrow path through their opponents and fled through Dibra. On 23 April 1467, Skanderbeg entered Kruj√´. Meanwhile, the Venetians had taken advantage of Mehmed's absence in Albania and sent a fleet under Vettore Capello into the Aegean. Capello attacked and occupied the islands of Imbros and Lemnos after which he sailed back and laid siege to Patras. √ñmer Bey, the Ottoman commander in Greece, led a relief force to Patras where he was initially repelled before turning on his pursuers, forcing them to flee, terminating their campaign. The victory was well received among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg was in his camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal an end to the war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was for help to come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending congratulatory messages, sent no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and was alone in allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to worry about the Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors who had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Kruj√´.

This time Skanderbeg didn't retreat immediately to the mountains, but decided for the first time to confront the great Ottoman army at Burshek, on the Shkumbin River's valley in order to give time for the civil population to retreat into the mountains. The battle was carried in such a way as to not result with winners or defeated; Skanderbeg then retreated while Ottoman grand vizier Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá pursued him but Skanderbeg succeeded in fleeing to the coast and then to the mountains. Meanwhile, Mehmed II sent detachments to raid the Venetian possessions (especially Durr√´s which was also put under siege and bombarded for a short period) and to keep them isolated. He besieged Kruj√´ for several days but when he realized that he could not take it by assault, he lifted the siege.

It lies on the right bank of the Tanaro on a wedge of land between that river and the Cevetta stream. History In the pre-Roman period the territory around Ceva was inhabited by the branch of the mountain Ligures known as Epanterii. Ceva in 1835 The upper Val Tanaro was Romanized in the second century BC and it is known that the area was organized around a municipium. However, it is not certain that this was Ceba: Mombasiglio is also regarded as a candidate. In the first century AD Columella referred to a particular breed of cattle raised here, and Pliny the Elder praised its sheep's milk cheese in his Natural History. The town is on the site of the old Roman road from Augusta Taurinorum via Pollentia to the coast and it is probable that there was a market here from which the cheese produced in the region was exported with Rome via the Ligurian ports of Vada Sabatia (the modern Vado Ligure) and/or Albingaunum (Albenga). In the Middle Ages it was the seat of a small marquisate, which lasted until the late 15th century when it was acquired by Savoy. Ceva was home to a fortress defending the confines of Piedmont towards Liguria, but the fortifications on the rock above the town were demolished in 1800 by the French, to whom it had been ceded in 1796. Ceva was heavily damaged by a flood of the Tanaro, Cevetta and Bovina rivers. Main sights The 16th century castle of the Pallavicino stands in an area of green parkland between the Tanaro and the Cevetta and comprises two small palaces: the original, red palazzina rossa and the later, white palazzina bianca. Remains of the 16th century fort are also present. The Duomo of Ceva, also known as the Collegiata dell'Assunzione della Beata Vergine Maria, was completed in 1605.

The cross-border movement of workers has become well-established in Southeast Asia, with Malaysia a major labour- receiving country and Indonesia and the Philippines the region's main labour- sending states. Managing cross-border migration (labour, refugee and human trafficking) has become an issue of increasing concern in Malaysia and its international relations.  Definitions  The term \\"illegal\\", when applied to \\"migration\\" and \\"migrant\\", has been replaced in recent years by \\"irregular\\" and \\"undocumented\\" on the grounds that \\"illegal\\" is inaccurate, degrading, and prejudicial. Key institutions have adopted the new terms: the UN General Assembly (1975), the International Labour Organization (2004), the European Parliament (2009), and the Associated Press (2013) and other US news agencies. The new terms are rarely used in official and academic discourse in Malaysia, where the popular term is \\"illegal immigrant\\". The term \\"illegals\\", elsewhere perceived as outdated and pejorative, is regularly used in Malaysian media.A sampling: Illegals a clear and present danger to nation, Home Ministry blamed for influx of illegals, No terrorists, only illegals slipped through KLIA immigration - Zahid The terminology is also obscure because Malaysian law (Immigration Act 1959/63) does not distinguish between undocumented economic migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and trafficked people; all are designated as illegal immigrants. The term \\"illegal immigrant\\" designates a variety of groups who are all liable to arrest, detention and deportation for immigration offences: * People who enter clandestinely, without travel authorisation * Children born to immigrants whose births have not been registered * Those seeking asylum, refugees, and trafficked victims * Those admitted with proper authorisation but who breach the terms of admission (e.g., by entering on student or tourist visas and then working) * Those admitted with authorisation to work, but who breach the terms of that authorisation (e.g., by changing their work or employer) * Those admitted with authorisation to work, but whose work permit is wrongfully cancelled by employers in a labour dispute * Those admitted with proper authorisation, but whose authorisation to stay has expired * Those admitted with authorisation to work but whose work authorisation has expired * Refugees in Sabah who were admitted for a temporary stay under the IMM13P (which must be renewed annually), but who fail to renew * Those possessing counterfeit or forged authorisation * Those possessing official authorisation which was obtained fraudulently  Background  Patterns of migration and the roles and responses of governments in the region concerning migration are rooted in the region's history. Present-day Malaysia has been a migration crossroads, where borders were lacking or permeable. = Pre-colonial migration = Malaysia's first generations of migrants were indigenous peoples, the Orang Asli, believed to have been part of the first wave of migration from Africa about 50,000 years ago or more-recent Asian evolution. The Malay Peninsula developed from port towns which thrived on trade routes from China to India and hosted the next migrants as merchants settled in the ports, some assimilating into the local communities. By the fifth century AD, networks of these towns had evolved into organised political spheres of influence defined by their centre rather than their borders. At the periphery, control is less certain. Borders may be permeable and control sometimes overlaps; areas might be under several powers, or none. During the second-century Langkasuka kingdoms, the eighth-century Srivijaya empire and the 15th-century Malacca Sultanate, the centre of power shifted between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. In addition to their link by political rule, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula were also linked by intermarriage between the Sumatran and Peninsular ruling elite (which led to the migration of their followers). Other significant early migrants are those now classified as Melayu Anak Dagang (non-Malays who migrated to the region and later assimilated into Malay culture, distinct from Melayu Anak Jati: ethnic Malays who are native to the region, including the Minangkabau people from Sumatra and the Bugis people from Sulawesi, Indonesia. Based on Malaysia's long history as a society of migrants, researchers at University Sains Malaysia say: \\"It is, however, pertinent to put the record straight that migration of people to the artificially created enclave known as Malaysia today dated back to centuries. Malaysia like many ex-colonies is artificial ...\\" Researcher Anthony Reid draws another conclusion from this history ‚Äì that Malaysia, like the US and Australia, is best viewed as an immigrant society: = Refugees and asylum-seekers = Malaysia, like most of its Southeast Asian neighbours, did not sign the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and maintains that newly-arrived aliens are illegal immigrants rather than refugees. However, since the early 1970s it has allowed Muslims involved in a conflict in their own country (especially the Moro people of the southern Philippines) to seek refuge in Malaysia. In 1975, Malaysia accepted thousands of Cambodian Muslims who had fled the Pol Pot regime. During the Indochina refugee crisis, Malaysia allowed a small number of Cambodian Muslims to immigrate (assisted by the Malaysian Muslim Welfare Organisation, funded by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Malaysian government. In 1980, Malaysia began admitting Rohingya and Acehnese Muslims who were fleeing the persecution in Myanmar and insurgency in Indonesia. Malaysian Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said in 2015 that his ministry has told the UNHCR several times that \\"Malaysia is not a signatory to its convention on refugees\\", and the United Nations should send refugees to another Third-World nation. Jaafar also said that refugees and migrant workers needed to observe Malaysian law in the country. According to Deputy Foreign Minister Reezal Merican Naina,  Immigration management  = Domestic politics = According to a National Registration Department (NRD) official, 60,000 illegal immigrants in the east Malaysian state of Sabah received Malaysian identity cards (MyKads); such allegations are known as Project IC. This was done through an ethnic connection to people in certain Malaysian occupations (such as the NRD, politics or security forces). A syndicate from Pakistan has mainly Pakistani clients, and syndicates from Myanmar and Indonesia have their own clients. Filipinos with identity documents brought family members to Sabah. An officer of the Eastern Sabah Security Command said that the corruption of local authorities and the issuance of fraudulent identity cards played an important role in the increase of crime in Sabah. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said that illegal immigrants long resident in Malaysia should not be barred from citizenship. According to researchers Myfel Joseph Paluga and Andrea Malaya Ragragio of the University of the Philippines Mindanao, the flood of migrants from Mindanao to Sabah was partly encouraged by Sabah politicians who \\"wanted to be the Sultan of Sulu\\" after the fall of the United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) and Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA) administrations. Following the rampant Islamisation and Muslims migration led by USNO chief Mustapha Harun, the Muslim population in Sabah drastically increased with negative perception from the native indigenous towards the Islam religion also increased as it have been endangering the local culture and practice of the indigenous. As part of the Islamisation of Sabah state, Malaysia affords shelter around Sabah to Filipino Muslims who running from the conflicts between Philippine government and their fellow separatists in their homeland of Mindanao. The Eastern Sabah Security Command Security Coordinating Intelligence Officer said that although the foreigners remained in Sabah, their loyalty to their homeland (Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago) in the Philippines never swayed and they brought drugs, smuggling and piracy. The Filipinos from this region are reportedly vengeful and ill-tempered, and disputes often result in shooting and bloody feuds (\\"a culture they call Rido\\"). During the influx of the Vietnamese boat people, the Malaysian government felt that they would threaten its national security and racial balance; most refugees resemble Malaysian Chinese, resulting in quick repatriation. The Malaysian government blamed the United States, accusing it of causing the Vietnam War and a massive influx of refugees to Vietnam's neighbours. Some Sabah Muslim MPs and State Assembly members, such as Rosnah Shirlin and Abdul Rahim Ismail, were aware of the Filipino Muslim problem. According to Shirlin, Ismail agreed: The Royal Commission of Inquiry on illegal immigrants in Sabah investigated the granting of citizenship to illegal immigrants. Former National Registration Director Mohd Nasir Sugip said that he was part of a secret operation, Ops Durian Buruk (Operation Rotten Durian), during the early 1990s in which the Election Commission of Malaysia and former Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub instructed his department to issue national identity cards to foreigners to change Sabah's voting demographics. The names of 16,000 illegal immigrants were changed by the instruction of the Sabah Election Commission. Former Sabah NRD director Ramli Kamarudin said that former Sabah Chief Minister Osu Sukam was present when Megat Junid gave instructions to carry out the project IC exercise. A Filipino man said that he received an identity card without applying for it, and Indian and Pakistani immigrants said that they received identity cards less than 10 years after they arrived in Sabah during the 1980s. The irregularities reportedly angered Sabahan natives, including those in neighbouring Sarawak. The Christian Dayak people are stateless, without birth certificates, while the newly-arrived illegal immigrants can obtain Malaysian identity cards in a short time. The Malaysian government reportedly favours Muslim asylum-seekers. = National security = In 2008, the Sabah deputy chief minister said that some illegal immigrants attempted to become Malaysian security-force members with fake identity cards. A Sulu militant in Sabah was a Malaysian police corporal with family in the southern Philippines who was believed to have aided militants in illegally entering and leaving the state. A security guard from Tawau in Sabah killed a bank officer in Subang Jaya, Selangor during a robbery. The security guard had a fake identity card, and was later identified as an Indonesian from Sulawesi. Lim Kit Siang asked how the security guard obtained a MyKad, enabling him to work at the bank: In addition to Sabah, the border in the Straits of Malacca between Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra enabled Indonesian immigrants to illegally enter the country; in 2014, an overloaded migrant boat sank. = Human trafficking = Malaysia, Thailand and Venezuela were listed in the third and lowest tier of the US Department of State's 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report. The country has made little progress to combat the exploitation of foreign migrant workers subjected to forced labour and those recruited under false pretenses and coerced into sex work. Rohingya refugees, seeking a better life in Malaysia, are frequently victimised by human traffickers who confine, beat and starve them and demand ransoms from their families. Many Filipinas, promised good jobs in other countries by brokers in the Philippines, have been trafficked to Malaysia and are vulnerable to detention by Malaysian authorities for illegal entry. Vietnamese and Chinese traffickers have shifted their prostitution rings to Malaysia, making Vietnamese women the largest number of foreign prostitutes in the country (followed by Cambodian women). Traffickers usually offer victims good-paying jobs in Malaysia; when they meet a trafficker (posing as a manager), they are imprisoned, raped and forced into sex work. Chinese traffickers kidnapped children, maimed them and used them to beg in the streets of Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia is an electrical-parts manufacturing centre, and large companies such as Panasonic and Samsung (as well as the McDonald's fast-food chain) were accused of poor treatment of workers. Cambodian housemaids have reportedly been poorly treated, and a Cambodian maid detained in a Malaysian immigration centre said that she saw three Cambodian and Vietnamese women die after severe abuse; Thai, Indonesian and Laotian prisoners were also reportedly abused. This however refuted by Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed who said the matter has been investigated and no deaths are actually occurred. Nevertheless, a Malaysian couple were sentenced to death for starving their Cambodian maid to death. Child-selling is ongoing, with babies brought from countries such as Thailand and Cambodia. Some are bought by infertile couples, but the less fortunate are sold to traffickers and forced to become sex slaves or beggars. Prostitution rings also offer babies from their foreign sex workers who become pregnant; some sex workers contact couples to offer their babies, since Malaysian law forbids migrant workers from having children in the country. = Social impact = In 1986, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) attempted to integrate Filipino refugees in Sabah with local communities if it could not repatriate them to the Philippines; however, this was opposed by the Sabah state government and local residents. The UNHCR tried a similar solution in 2015, issuing refugee cards in West Malaysia without government approval.  Policy  The Immigration Department of Malaysia has promised that Malaysia will be free from illegal immigrants in 2020. = Amnesty programme = In 2011, Malaysia introduced Program 6P to reduce the number of illegal immigrants. The 6P is shorthand for six Malay words beginning with p: pendaftaran (registration), pemutihan (legalisation), pengampunan (amnesty), pemantauan (supervision), penguatkuasaan (enforcement) and pengusiran (deportation). Illegal immigrants were given three weeks to accept the offer or face legal penalties if found without a valid travel document or work permit. There was a call to strengthen the programme by monitoring management companies appointed as intermediaries between employers and illegal foreign workers. = Enforcement = Malaysian authorities have frequently cracked down on illegal immigrants (sometimes without notice), with more frequent enforcement since 2014. Illegal immigrants are imprisoned, caned and deported. In early 2017, a former employee of the Malaysian Registration Department (JPN) was sentenced to 156 years in prison for giving illegal citizenship to Filipino immigrants in Sabah. = Regional co-operation = A joint border commission has been formed with the Philippines to patrol from the southern Philippines to East Malaysia, and Thailand has agreed to lengthen its border wall along the Malaysian state of Kedah to curb the flow of illegal workers across the Malay‚ÄìThai border. Spanish Ambassador to Malaysia Mar√≠a Bassols Delgado has urged the country to develop closer ties with other ASEAN nations to solve the immigrant problem: \\"Close understanding between Asean countries would result in a more effective approach to identify the individuals who entered the country illegally and without identification papers. This would facilitate the process of sending them back to their countries of origin\\". Malaysia received two Bay-class patrol boats from Australia in 2015, and said that the vessels would be used to protect their maritime borders from illegal migration across the Straits of Malacca. Before a November 2016 meeting between Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in Putrajaya, both leaders agreed to deport illegal Filipino migrants and refugees in Sabah back to the Philippines and signed agreements to improve the social conditions of legal Filipino migrants and expatriates in the state with a school, hospital, and consulate. That month, Thai Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan announced a plan to replace the southern Malay‚ÄìThai border fence with a wall; Wongsuwan got the idea from a meeting in Laos with his Malaysian counterparts.

Beyond the narrow scholarly issue, the story also shows a typically imaginative Jamesian protagonist inventing an alternative reality in his lecture on the Bard's supposed childhood activities. Plot summary Morris Gedge is a librarian at a dull provincial library in England that is \\"all granite, fog and female fiction.\\" He gets a welcome offer to become the custodian of the Shakespeare house at Stratford-on-Avon. Although Shakespeare's name is never mentioned in the story (James used the name twice in his Notebooks when he was planning the tale) it's obvious to whom \\"the supreme Mecca of the English-speaking race\\" is devoted. Once installed as the custodian, Morris begins to doubt the chatter he is forced to give to tourists who visit the home. He starts to qualify and hesitate in his spiel. This brings anguish to his wife and a warning from the shrine's proprietors. Gedge finally decides that if silliness is what's wanted, he'll supply it abundantly. The last section of the story shows him delivering a hilarious lecture on how the child Shakespeare played around the house. Of course, receipts from tourists increase and Gedge gets a raise. Major themes This story is a superbly humorous play on James' common theme of how the imaginative \\"children of light\\" inevitably find trouble in the real, unforgiving world. Morris is something of an exception in that he triumphs over the world's attempts to grind him down...by giving the world exactly what it wants. The story illustrates T. S. Eliot's dictum that humankind cannot bear very much reality. But the story does not read at all as a grim reminder of how people would rather hear sweet fiction than sour fact. James clearly sympathizes with the amusing way Gedge devises a more appealing \\"reality\\" in his great parodic lecture on Shakespeare's imagined childhood. As for the authorship question itself, James found it very hard to believe that the \\"Stratford man\\" wrote the plays and sonnets. But he had found it almost as difficult to believe in any of the other supposed authors, such as Sir Francis Bacon. The final message of The Birthplace seems to be that Shakespeare's works themselves are far more important than the biographical details of whoever wrote them. Critical evaluation Some critics have seen Morris' compromise not as the development of an artist but rather as the prostitution of an honest man. To some extent this view has validity because Gedge is forced to sacrifice scholarly scruples in favor of a more entertaining presentation. But the story's light touch indicates that James probably admired Morris' ability to construct a clever and detailed fantasy. After all, that's what James himself did in his own fiction. Most critics agree that the story is delightfully told, no matter what the verdict may be on Gedge's intellectual integrity. Morris' final lecture is particularly memorable for its brilliant satire of tourist-trap hucksterism: :Across that threshold He habitually passed; through those low windows, in childhood, He peered out into the world that He was to make much happier by the gift to it of His genius; over the boards of this floor...His little feet often pattered; and the beams of this ceiling...He endeavoured, in boyish strife, to jump up and touch.

In recent years there has been increased concern for the effect of man-made noise pollution in the ocean, particularly upon cetaceans - which are known to be sensitive to sound. As a result, environmental regulations have been introduced in an attempt to minimise negative impacts on marine wildlife. These guidelines have focused on the oil industry's seismic exploration for offshore oil. They center on the practice of delaying or shutting down the use of air-guns if a whale or dolphin is sighted nearby. An MMO will implement these regulations in the field. When on board the seismic vessel, the MMO's job is two-fold: *To spot sensitive wildlife species *To monitor adherence to the guidelines. Spotting, and identifying, animals involves long hours of visual surveys. Detecting cetaceans with hydrophones is known as Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM), and this is an increasingly common technique used in addition to visual surveys. Ensuring adherence to guidelines requires a thorough knowledge of the regulations, understanding of the operations and the ability to communicate effectively with the crew. MMOs usually have a strong background in marine biology and conservation. Increasingly, the oil industry is employing a 'best practice' attitude to environmental commitment and voluntarily taking on MMOs as independent observers in areas where no government regulations exist. In some circumstances guidelines may be open to interpretation or the environmental conditions unique and the MMO will be called upon to advise on a sensible mitigation protocol. As well as the seismic exploration industry, MMOs may also be required during; oil rig decommissioning, where disused oil platform pilings on the seabed are removed by large amounts of explosives, marine construction projects and; military trials of powerful new active sonar systems. Typically MMO duties are funded by the company surveying. Noise from human activity in the ocean environment is likely to increase - and become a bigger environmental issue. Discussion of how to minimize the negative effects of noise upon whales, dolphins and other marine-life will no doubt continue between industry, government agencies, military, environmental organizations and academics. It will be the MMO who puts this into practice in the field.

It was the district capital of the Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis (Central Ore Mountains district) in the southern part of Saxony, and since August 2008 it has been part of the new district of Erzgebirgskreis. As of 2007, the town had 14,181 inhabitants. Location and design The town is situated on a plateau north of the Ore Mountain ridge, at an elevation between 460 and 891 metres above sea level. It is approximately 31 kilometres south of Chemnitz, to which it is connected via the Fl√∂ha Valley Railway. The historical town centre follows a rectangular plan, imitating Italian renaissance. The centre is the market square, a square of 1.7 hectares in area. Marienberg and Pobershau were merged into the administrative unit (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft) of Marienberg, Pobershau has been incorporated into Marienberg with effect from 1 January 2012. History = Marienberg and the villages of Gebirge, Gelobtland and H√ºttengrund = The first documented evidence relating to Marienberg is a mention of the village of W√ºstenschletta as Sletyn in 1323. But by 1481 it was being referred as w√ºste Schlette (\\"abandoned Schlette\\"). The owner of the eponymous glassworks in 1486 was Barthol Preu√üler. On 17 July 1519, silver was first discovered as the entrance to the H√ºttengrund by Clemens Schiffel and, on 11 May 1520, the first ore mine (Fundgrube), St. Fabian Sebastian, was leased to Schiffel. The town was founded on 27 April 1521 by Henry the Pious, Duke of Saxony. The town plan was designed by Ulrich R√ºlein von Calw. Marienberg was granted town rights in 1523 and was given its own mining office (Bergamt) in 1525. A grammar school (Lateinschule) was first mentioned in 1530. The village of W√ºstenschletta was subordinated to the jurisdiction of the town in 1533. With the Protestant Reformation reaching the town in 1536/37, Marienberg became an independent parish. Mining reached its peak in 1540. From 1541 to 1566, the town walls were erected. In 1555, there were more than a thousand pits in the Marienberg mining area. The Late Gothic hall church of St. Mary's was built from 1558 to 1564. On 31 August 1610, the town suffered in a devastating fire in which almost all its 550 houses were destroyed. Following the end of silver mining, the extraction of copper and tin began in 1612. In 1696 troops were first quartered in the town, and from 1753 to 1858, it was a garrison town for the cavalry. Around 1755, Gelobtland (literally: \\"Promised Land\\") was mentioned for the first time in the records (\\"... in the Gelobten Land ...\\"). In the wake of a fever (Faulfieber) epidemic, an orphanage was founded in 1772, which was expanded into a school (Freischule) in 1805. To improve the food situation of the mining employees a miner's grain store (Bergmagazin) was built from 1806 to 1809 on the recommendation of mining director Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich von Trebra. In 1810, a school was built in the village of Gebirge. In 1813 Marienberg became a staging post for the allied armies facing Napoleon. In 1821, the village of Gelobtland was created as a settlement for forest workers. In 1835, the dilapidated town wall was taken down, with the exception of the Zschopau Gate (Zschopauer Tor) and the Red Tower (Roter Turm). In 1842, Marienberg became the seat of the church parish. In 1847, the mining office was closed; that same year a kindergarten was opened in the presence of Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr√∂bel. From 1858 to 1873 Marienberg served as a garrison town for the infantry. The volunteer fire service was founded in 1862. From 1873 to 1920, there was an NCO school and preschool in Marienberg; in 1874 work on the construction of the barracks was begun. In the same year construction started on a gas works and the installation of gas lanterns. In 1875 Marienberg was given a connection to the railway network with the construction of the Fl√∂ha Valley Railway with stations in Marienberg itself, Gebirge, and Gelobtland. In 1882, volunteer fire services were established in Gelobtland and Gebirge. In 1889 the town hospital opened. A water works was built in 1891/1892 and the Central School (Zentralschule, now the gymnasium) was inaugurated in 1893. In 1899 the Rudolf shaft mine closed and, with that, the last mine was gone. In 1910, a power station was built and, in 1913, Marienberg connected to the main electricity supply. In 1914, the church, the Red Tower and the Zschopau Gate were placed under protection by a local by- law. In 1917, work began on the building of the district court. At Gallows Hill (Galgenberg) in 1927 a ski jump was opened. A junior high school and Progymnasium was founded in 1918 and was housed until 1940 within the barracks. With the construction of twelve semi-detached houses from 1933 to 1937, the district of Moosheide was formed. Between 1924 and 1937, the Marienberg Triangle Race (Marienberger Dreieckrennen) took place ten times. The 17 km route ran from Marienberg, via the Heinzebank and Wolkenstein and back to Marienberg. At that time it was the fastest motorcycle road racing circuit in Germany and has hosted rounds of the German motorcycle road championship. Towards the end of World War II, 154 concentration camp prisoners from the subcamp of Wille in Tr√∂glitz/Rehmsdorf were murdered during a death march by members of the SS. They had escaped from transport trains at Gelobtland and Reitzenhain stations during enemy strafing attacks between 15 and 17 April 1945 into the surrounding forests, but were recaptured. From 1874 to 1939, Marienberg was the seat of the eponymous Amtshauptmannschaft which became the county of Marienberg in 1939. The latter was absorbed into the county of Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis in 1994 and, in 2008, the county of Erzgebirgskreis at which point the town lost its status as the county town. Since 2013, there are no more scheduled passenger trains to Marienberg,Freie Presse Online: Fahrplanwechsel bei der Bahn: Marienberg rollt aufs Abstellgleis, retrieved 02 July 2015 while the section of the railway line to Reitzenhain was already closed in 1998. From 1994 to 2012, several surrounding municipalities were merged with Marienberg. These were in chronological order Lauta (1 January 1994), Niederlauterstein (1 January 1996), Lauterbach (1 January 1998), Hirtstein (1 January 2003), Pobershau (1 January 2012), and the town of Z√∂blitz (31 December 2012). =Town districts= Marienberg's districts are: *Marienberg itself *Ansprung *Gebirge *Gelobtland *Grundau *K√ºhnhaide *Lauta *Lauterbach *Niederlauterstein *Pobershau *Reitzenhain *Rittersberg *R√ºbenau *Satzung am Hirtstein *Sorgau *Z√∂blitz  Culture and sights  Marienberg town hall View along Zschopauer Stra√üe to the town church of St. Mary's The Marienberg mining store (Bergmagazin), since 2006 a museum for the Saxon-Bohemian Ore Mountains The historic old town (Altstadt) of Marienberg and the mining country near Lauta is a site being proposed as a candidate for the UNESCO World Heritage site called the Ore Mountain Mining Region (Montanregion Erzgebirge). = Structures = * St. Mary's ‚Äì a Late Gothic hall church * Town hall built in the Renaissance style * Red Tower (Roter Turm) ‚Äì the last of originally 4 corner towers in the town wall * Zschopau Gate (Zschopauer Tor) ‚Äì last of originally 5 town gates * Old Mining Store (Bergmagazin) ‚Äì built 1806-1809 * Rectangular town plan with a square market place (the Marktplatz) * Saxon post milestone (Kurs√§chsische Postmeilens√§ule) from the Zschopau Gate; part of the coat of arms of a Saxon post milestone from the Annaberg Gate in the museum, electoral Saxon full milestone from the High Bridge (Hohe Br√ºcke) as a monument at the Bergmagazin, parts of a Saxon half-milestone walled into the archway of Haus Reiter and two quarter-milestones on the original post road near Reitzenhain and, as the Wettin Oak monument (Wettin Eiche), on Eisenstra√üe in the Marienberg Forest (Marienberger Forst) * Royal Saxon milestones as sentinel stones from the Wolkenstein Gate on Wolkensteiner Stra√üe and converted in 1900 to kilometre stones at the old Freiberg Gate and at the Lauterbach junction on the B 171 federal road. = Museums = * Museum of the Saxon-Bohemian Ore Mountains (Museum s√§chsisch-b√∂hmisches Erzgebirge) in the Bergmagazin = Memorials = * Memorial site created in 1952 at Marienberg-Gelobtland station in memory of the murdered concentration camp prisoners * Memorial plaque for 23 French and 34 Soviet prisoners of the Fl√∂ha subcamp of Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, who were also murdered by the SS in spring 1945 * Memorial site created in 1950 on the B 174 in a wood near Reitzenhain for 218 prisoners executed by SS guards * Gravesite dug in 1945 at the cemetery for Italian military internees * Memorial plaque on the staircase of the town hall to the social democrat resistance fighter, Walter Mehnert, who was murdered on 18 October 1943 in the gaol at Brandenburg-G√∂rden (not in Moabit as stated on the plaque) = Major events = * 26 to 29 July 2001: German Christian Endeavour (Entschieden f√ºr Christus) conference (Christian youth conference) * 1 to 3 September 2006: 15th Day of Saxony in Marienberg = Culinary specialities = * Lauterbacher Tropfen  Economy and infrastructure  Marienberg is developing its tourism offer; one aspect of that being the Silver Road which runs through the town. A German armoured infantry unit, the Panzergrenadierbataillon 371, is based in the Bundeswehr barracks called Erzgebirgskaserne. The barracks lies on the edge of the old town. In 1996 the unit was given the honorary title the \\"Marienberg Rifles\\" (Marienberger J√§ger) by the town council. = Transport = The Fl√∂ha Valley Railway, opened in 1875 and now operated by the DB Erzgebirgsbahn, provided a connection to Chemnitz (via Pockau-Lengefeld and Fl√∂ha) until 2013. The section between Pockau-Lengefeld and Marienberg is still in use for freight trains, the section between Marienberg and Reitzenhain was closed in 1998 and has been lifted in 2013.Niederschrift √ºber die 12.

The B 174 federal highway from Chemnitz runs through the town towards Reitzenhain (border of Czech Republic), and crosses B 171 from Wolkenstein to Dippoldiswalde near H√ºttengrund. The Reitzenhain Pass is the lowest pass in the Ore Mountains and was therefore one of the most important communication links between central Germany and Bohemia in the Middle Ages. State roads connect Marienberg with Annaberg-Buchholz, Pockau, and Lengefeld. The construction of the ring road, planned for many years, which routes the B 174 east of Marienberg, was started in 2005. It was opened on 29 November 2007 in the presence of Federal Transport Minister, Wolfgang Tiefensee. Public transport is provided by VMS with scheduled cross-country buses to Annaberg-Buchholz, Brand-Erbisdorf, Chemnitz, Freiberg, Niederschmiedeberg, Olbernhau, Wolkenstein, and Zschopau as well as local buses connecting the various parts of the town. = Media = MEF (Mittel-Erzgebirgs-Fernsehen), a TV station, has been operating since 1989 and aims to provide a broadcasting platform for the community of the county of Mittlerer Erzgebirgkreis.

The empty train was signalled to draw up behind the express in order to clear the way for another train. The driver of the empty train, who was the only fatality, was considered not to have kept a good lookout. This was possibly compounded by excessive working hours and by the alcohol that was subsequently found in his bloodstream. The Rule Book was changed to avoid this situation. Now if a train is to be signalled into an occupied section and that train is not booked to call at that location, the driver must be first advised.

It was previously under the authority of Shelby County Schools until Collierville Schools splintered from it in 2014. Its school colors are maroon and white and its mascot is the dragon, originally designed by elementary art teacher Lisa Ackerman as \\"Blister the Dragon\\". Collierville High School is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and holds memberships in NASSP, the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA), NACAC, and SACAC. History The original campus was built in 1905, with expansions and additions being made in 1911, 1924, and 1926; the last was a large gymnasium. In the 1930s, the school became one of the first buildings in Tennessee to be aided by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and it was given a $250,000 grant by the CWA in the winter of 1933‚Äì34. Hundreds of workers were brought in from Memphis, Tennessee to build an auditorium, library, and study hall in later years. The second campus sat at the intersection of Byhalia and Frank Road on the same property that once held the Bellevue High-Security Correctional Facility. Collierville High School transitioned there in the autumn of 1995, after ninety years at its original campus. The site received a $14,500,000 addition that made it the largest school facility in Shelby County. In 2014, Collierville High School became the central high school of the newly-created Collierville Schools district after its formation from Shelby County Schools. The third and current campus, first opened for the 2018‚Äì19 school year, was built on land south of State Route 385 and east of Sycamore Road on Shelby Drive at a cost of $94 million due to overcrowding at the previous campus. The former building at Byhalia and Frank Road became the seat of West Collierville Middle School. Academics Academically, the school offers 5 dual enrollment courses, 34 Honors courses, and 25 Advanced Placement courses. It was listed on Newsweek‚Äôs America‚Äôs Best High Schools list from 2008-2013, has the largest PTSA in the state of Tennessee, and has had 21 United States Presidential Scholar candidates in the past fourteen years with two Presidential Scholar winners (in 2002 and 2014). =Extracurriculars= Collierville High School offers an array of extracurricular activities. 51 clubs are registered at the school, in addition to a public-access television cable TV station located on its campus that serves the local Shelby County Comcast and UVerse community on Comcast channel 98.7 & UVerse channel 119. Additionally, CHS's STEM program includes the Dragon Robotics team, which competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition and VEX. Athletics The school accommodates twenty-two sports and five club sports. The boys' baseball team won the state championship in 2013, and the school's Joshua Wheeler won the 2014 Decathlon state championship for track and field. In addition, it is one of only two schools in West Tennessee with a mountain biking team.

The NIRC was created by the Conservative government of Ted Heath as a way to limit the power of trades union in the United Kingdom. It was empowered to grant injunctions as necessary to prevent injurious strikes and also to settle a variety of labour disputes. It also heard appeals from the Industrial tribunals. Unusually, its jurisdiction extended throughout the UK, making no distinction between England and Wales or Scotland. Its first and only President was John Donaldson, supported by John Brightman (both High Court judges who later became Law Lords) and Lord Thomson, a judge of the Scottish Court of Session. The court also had nine appointed lay members, and one of the three judges sat with a lay panel. The court hearings were in public, but its procedure was relatively informal, with neither the judge nor barristers wearing wigs or gowns. The NIRC was controversial throughout its short life. Donaldson, the president of the court, was known to have Conservative leanings, having stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the Conservative party and, indeed, having contributed to the drafting of the Industrial Relations Act. Many cases were decided against the trades unions, although the unions had a policy of not co-operating with, and in many cases ignoring, the court. In July 1972, a dispute involving the dock workers union led to five shop stewards being imprisoned in Pentonville Prison for contempt of court. Unofficial strike action in support of the Pentonville Five created a national crisis, only averted when the Official Solicitor (advised by John Vinelott, later a High Court judge) appealed the arrests to the Court of Appeal, who ordered their release. A dispute involving the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers also led to a finding of contempt of court, a substantial fine, and an order for the sequestration of the assets of the union (although the fine was ultimately paid anonymously). The NIRC was abolished by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 soon after the Labour government of Harold Wilson came to power in 1974. One of the leading legal decisions of the NIRC was Norton Tool Co Ltd v Tewson [1972] ICR, in which Donaldson J ruled that damages for wrongful dismissal only extended to financial loss, and that compensation was not available for non-pecuniary losses, such as injury to pride or feelings. This position was doubted by Lord Hoffmann in Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2003] 1 AC 518, but upheld in Dunnachie v Kingston-upon-Hull City Council [2004] UKHL 36.

Pakula, adapted from William Styron's 1979 novel of the same name. The film stars Meryl Streep as Zofia \\"Sophie\\" Zawistowski, a Polish immigrant with a dark secret from her past who shares a boarding house in Brooklyn with her tempestuous lover, Nathan and a young writer Stingo. It also stars Kevin Kline (in his feature film debut), Peter MacNicol, Rita Karin, Stephen D. Newman, and Josh Mostel. Sophie's Choice premiered in Los Angeles on December 8, 1982 and was theatrically released on December 10 by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $30 million. Streep's titular performance was unanimously praised, often cited amongst the best acting performances in film history. The film received five nominations at the 55th Academy Awards; Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score, with Streep winning Best Actress. Plot In 1947, Stingo moves to Brooklyn to write a novel, and is befriended by Sophie Zawistowski, a Polish immigrant, and her emotionally unstable lover, Nathan Landau. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings, he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him, and he abuses and harasses her. A flashback shows how Nathan first met Sophie after her immigration to the U.S. when she nearly died due to anemia. Sophie tells Stingo that before she came to the U.S., her husband and father were killed in a German work camp, and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Stingo later learns from a college professor that Sophie's father was a Nazi sympathizer. When Stingo confronts Sophie with this, she admits the truth and tells him about her war-time lover, J√≥zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, and was a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later, J√≥zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. Nathan tells Sophie and Stingo that he is doing groundbreaking research at a pharmaceutical company, but Nathan's physician brother tells Stingo that Nathan is a paranoid schizophrenic, and that all of the schools that Nathan attended were \\"expensive funny farms\\". Nathan is not a biologist as he claims. He does have a job at a pharmaceutical firm, but it is in the library, which his brother obtained for him, and he only occasionally assists with research. After Nathan believes Sophie has betrayed him again, he calls Sophie and Stingo on the telephone and fires a gun in a violent rage. Sophie and Stingo flee to a hotel. She reveals to him that, upon arrival at Auschwitz, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death. Sophie and Stingo have sex, but while Stingo is sleeping, Sophie returns to Nathan. Sophie and Nathan commit suicide by taking cyanide. Stingo recites the poem \\"Ample Make This Bed\\" by Emily Dickinson ‚Äî the American poet that Sophie was fond of reading. Stingo moves to a small farm that his father recently inherited in southern Virginia to finish writing his novel.

Streep was very determined to get the role. After obtaining a bootlegged copy of the script, she went after Pakula, and threw herself on the ground, begging him to give her the part. Pakula's first choice was Liv Ullmann, for her ability to project the foreignness that would add to her appeal in the eyes of an impressionable, romantic Southerner. The film was mostly shot in New York City, with Sophie's flashback scenes shot afterwards in Yugoslavia. Production for the film, at times, was more like a theatrical set than a film set. Pakula allowed the cast to rehearse for three weeks, and was open to improvisation from the actors, \\"spontaneous things\\", according to Streep. Streep had to lose a lot of weight to film the scenes in Yugoslavia at the concentration camp. Release The film had its premiere at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Los Angeles on Wednesday, December 8, 1982 and then opened December 10 in nine theatres in New York City (Cinema 1 and 3); Los Angeles (Avco 2); San Francisco; San Jose, California; Chicago; Dallas; Washington D.C.; and Toronto. Reception =Critical reception= Meryl Streep's performance received widespread critical acclaim and earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Sophie's Choice received positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds a 78% rating based on 40 reviews, with an average score of 6.91/10. On Metacritic, the film has a 68 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\".\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, calling it \\"a fine, absorbing, wonderfully acted, heartbreaking movie. It is about three people who are faced with a series of choices, some frivolous, some tragic. As they flounder in the bewilderment of being human in an age of madness, they become our friends, and we love them.\\" Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, finding it \\"not as powerful or as involving\\" as the novel but praising Streep for a \\"striking performance.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Though it's far from a flawless movie, 'Sophie's Choice' is a unified and deeply affecting one. Thanks in large part to Miss Streep's bravura performance, it's a film that casts a powerful, uninterrupted spell.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post stated, \\"There is greatness in the extraordinary performances of Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol, who endow the principal characters of 'Sophie's Choice' with appealing, ultimately heartbreaking individuality and romantic glamor.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Todd McCarthy at Variety called it \\"a handsome, doggedly faithful and astoundingly tedious adaptation of William Styron's best-seller. Despite earnest intentions and top talent involved, lack of chemistry among the three leading players and over- elaborated screenplay make this a trying experience to sit through.\\" Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Although many of the book's characters have been cut away, and with them some of its torrent of words, the film feels claustrophobic, prolix and airless to the point of stupefaction ... Yet, whatever the film's overall problems, the role of Sophie, its beautiful, complex, worldly heroine, gives Meryl Streep the chance at bravura performance and she is, in a word, incandescent.\\"Benson, Sheila (December 10, 1982). \\"Streep Shines Through 'Sophie' Drawbacks\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 1. Boston Globe film critic Michael Blowen wrote, \\"Pakula's literal adaptation of Styron's Sophie's Choice is an admirable, if reverential, movie that crams this triangle into a 2-1/2 hour character study enriched by Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline, and nearly destroyed by Peter MacNicol.\\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote that it \\"is, I think, an infuriatingly bad movie ... The whole plot is based on a connection that isn't there‚Äîthe connection between Sophie and Nathan's relationship and what the Nazis did to the Jews. Eventually, we get to the Mystery‚Äîto Sophie's Choice‚Äîand discover that the incident is garish rather than illuminating, and too particular to demonstrate anything general.\\" The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress (Streep), and was nominated for Best Cinematography (Almendros), Costume Design (Wolsky), Best Music (Hamlisch), and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Pakula). Streep's characterization was voted the third-greatest movie performance of all time by Premiere Magazine.

MRLS was first observed in the U.S. state of Kentucky in a three-week period around May 5, 2001, when about 20% to 30% of Kentucky's pregnant mares suffered abortions. A primary infectious cause was rapidly ruled out, and the search began for a candidate toxin. No abortifacient toxins were identified. In the spring of 2001, Kentucky had experienced an extraordinarily heavy infestation of eastern tent caterpillars (ETCs). An epidemiological study showed ETCs to be associated with MRLS. When ETCs returned to Kentucky in the spring of 2002, equine exposure to caterpillars was immediately shown to produce abortions. Research then focused on how the ETCs produced the abortions. Reviewing the speed with which ETCs produced late-term abortions in 2002 experiments, the nonspecific bacterial infections in the placenta/fetus were assigned a primary driving role. The question then became how exposure to the caterpillars produced these non- specific bacterial infections of the affected placenta/fetus and also the uveitis and pericarditis cases. Reviewing the barbed nature of ETC hairs (setae), intestinal blood vessel penetration by barbed setal fragments was shown to introduce barbed setal fragments and associated bacterial contaminants into intestinal collecting blood vessels (septic penetrating setae). Distribution of these materials following cardiac output would deliver these materials to all tissues in the body (septic penetrating setal emboli). About 15% of cardiac output goes to the late-term fetus, at which point the septic barbed setal fragments are positioned to penetrate placental tissues which lack an immune response. Bacterial proliferation, therefore, proceeds unchecked and the late-term fetus is rapidly aborted. Similar events occur with the early-term fetus, but as a much smaller target receiving an equivalently smaller fraction of cardiac output, the early-term fetus is less likely to be \\"hit\\" by a randomly distributing setal fragment. Since this MRLS pathogenesis model was first proposed in 2002, other caterpillar-related abortion syndromes have been recognized, most notably equine amnionitis and fetal loss in Australia, and more recently, a long-recognized relationship between pregnant camels eating caterpillars and abortions among the camel pastoralists in the western Sahara. History What became MRLS was first noted on April 26, 2001, by Dr. Thomas Riddle of Lexington, Kentucky, who observed an unusual number of equine in utero early fetal deaths in 60-day-old fetuses he was examining by ultrasound for sex determination. These early fetal losses were soon followed by a sequence of numerous early and late fetal losses and, recognized somewhat later, coincident and relatively small numbers of pericarditis, unilateral uveitis, and encephalitis syndromes occurring in horses of all ages and sexes. The fetal loss numbers were large. During the three weeks around the first of May, 2001, about 20% to 30% of Kentucky's pregnant mares suffered abortions. Of foals conceived in the spring of 2001, about 2000 were lost, the so-called early fetal losses (EFLs). Of foals conceived during the spring of 2000, and then close to term, at least 600 were lost, the so-called late fetal losses (LFLs). Based on these overwhelming reproductive losses, the syndrome was named the mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS). MRLS was defined as including four syndromes: (1) EFLs, (2) LFLs, (3) unique unilateral uveitis, and (4) pericarditis syndrome. An associated encephalitis syndrome was not included in the original case definition. The unusual pericarditis cases and the unique single-eye uveitis cases were observed in horses of all ages, breeds, and sexes, were independent of any state of pregnancy, and that they occurred at the same time as the early and late fetal loss syndromes. From the first, therefore, MRLS was clearly not simply a pregnancy-related syndrome. The total economic loss to Kentucky and the racing industry for the 2001 MRLS season has been estimated at $336-$500 million. Coincident with the MRLS syndrome in May 2001, Kentucky was experiencing an extraordinarily heavy infestation of eastern tent caterpillars (ETCs). As part of an extensive and multifaceted investigation spearheaded by the University of Kentucky, a rigorous epidemiological survey by Dr. Roberta Dwyer and her associates soon confirmed an association of MRLS with the presence of the caterpillar. Yet to come, however, was scientific proof that the caterpillars were the cause of MRLS, and the proposed mechanism by which they affected horses. Clinical signs MRLS was initially characterized by four syndromes: (1) EFLs, (2) LFLs and the nonreproductive syndromes, (3) unilateral uveitis, (4) pericarditis, and later (5) Actinobacillus encephalitis. MRLS was observed in mares of all breeds and ages. Early and late fetal losses were observed within the first and last trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. For EFLs, clinical signs from the sick mares included pus-like discharge from the vulva and fetal membranes protruding from the vulva, as the fetuses were located in either the vagina or vulva. One to three days prior to the EFLs, several mares showed mild colic symptoms, abdominal straining, or low-grade fever. Within a week of abortion, inspections indicated moderate to severe inflammation within the uterine region. Performing ultrasounds revealed either dead fetuses or live fetuses with slow heart rates and lethargic movements. All the fetuses, both alive and dead, were surrounded by cloudy amniotic fluid. Clinical signs for LFLs included explosive parturition, dystocia, foaling while standing, premature placenta separation, and foals either stillborn or born weak. Placentas were observed to carry a pale brown hue as opposed to their usual dark reddish- brown color. The umbilical cords were thick, dull, yellowish, and inflamed. The weak foals were often incapable of breathing on their own and required resuscitation. These foals were also observed to be dehydrated and hypothermic, with irregular heartbeat and respiration. The majority of these foals did not survive past four days. One finding observed exclusively in MRLS was unilateral uveitis; initially, affected horses expressed inflammation around a single eye, along with fluid accumulation on the corneas, anterior and posterior chambers due to the inflammation. The fluid in the anterior chambers exhibited tan to yellow hues, and often was accompanied by hemorrhaging around the surface of the iris. Cause Eastern tent caterpillars The eastern tent caterpillar infestation in the spring of 2001 was extraordinary. It was not uncommon to observe more than a dozen caterpillars per square foot of lawn or pasture. One photograph shows a water bucket completely engulfed with ETCs. The pasture presence of ETCs was thought to be related to the MRLS abortions, leading to ETC epidemiological studies. ETC eggs are preferentially laid in webs on black cherry trees, and the primary food for ETCs is black cherry tree leaves. By June 2001, Kentucky ETCs were no longer available for research, and would not reappear until the following April/May. MRLS research in the interim focused on the possible role of black cherry tree-related cyanide as the proximal cause of MRLS. The leaves of black cherry trees are known to be toxic due to their production of cyanide. Cyanide conveyed to mares via the caterpillars was initially thought to be the causative agent. Administration of both cyanide and mandelonitrile (a cyanide-containing chemical in cherry leaves) to horses demonstrated cyanide does not cause MRLS. When the caterpillars returned to central Kentucky in late April 2002, they were readily shown to cause both the early and late fetal losses. In 2002, investigators' attention was drawn to the highly toxic Brazilian Lonomia obliqua caterpillar setae and their enzymatic fibrinolysin toxin. A caterpillar defense mechanism based on specific setal toxins made more biological sense than a defense based on intestinal cyanide content. More importantly, if the ETC abortions were due to an enzyme or toxin, it should be possible to vaccinate horses against the toxin, an approach already explored with reference to the Lonomia toxin. In June 2002, conception of this ETC enzymatic setal toxin hypothesis was recorded as an intellectual property (IP) disclosure with the University of Kentucky IP office in which creation of an anti-ETC abortifacient toxin vaccine was proposed. Following these initiatives, when ETCs again became available in 2002, a number of experiments on pregnant mice seeking to evaluate the use of pregnant mice as a laboratory model of MRLS and to develop experimental support for a filterable protein ETC toxin. These experiments showed intact ETC setae appeared to cause fetal resorption in mice, but frozen ETC setae and ETC setal filtrates failed to produce fetal resorptions in mice. Mechanism of action The septic penetrating setal emboli (SPSE) hypothesis is the most probable mechanism of action for ETC exposure leading to MRLS. SPSE is believed to be a completely novel hypothesis, without precedent in biology or medicine. Reviewing the speed with which ETC dosing produced LFLs in controlled experiments and the barbed nature of ETC hairs (setae), and thereafter) intestinal blood vessel penetration by barbed ETC setal fragments, followed by their systemic distribution following cardiac output (SPSE) and then distant tissue penetration by these distributed fragments to tissues with reduced immune responses, i.e., the early- and late-term fetus, the eye, and the heart/pericardial space/fluid, followed by bacterial proliferation in the reduced immune response tissue (fetus, eye, pericardial fluid) would both quantitatively account for and mechanistically link all four MRLS syndromes, including most particularly the unique and unprecedented single-eye lesions. In this probabilistic model, the number of actual distributing setal fragments is assumed to be small, on the order of tens per day, but the probability of a clinically observed adverse event in a poorly immune-protected tissue penetrated by a setal fragment was assumed to be close to 1.0, leading to the numerous EFL and LFL events and the rare but essentially unique single-eye events of MRLS. A poor immune response in affected tissues is an integral part of the SPSE hypothesis. ETC setal fragments distributing bacteria to immune competent tissues, as occurred in all horses in central Kentucky during the ETC/MRLS do not appear to produce any observable clinical responses. However, the fetus is well known to be poorly immune protected, as is the eye, and extracellular tissue fluids such as the pericardial fluid are also less well immune protected, i.e., the four tissues in which clinical lesions of MRLS were observed. The pericardial and single-eye events, occurring at the same time as the reproductive loss events, but in horses of all ages and sexes, meant the MRLS factor \\"went through\\" essentially all central Kentucky horses at the time of the MRLS reproductive events. However, only in pregnant mares were the most numerous, dramatic and commercially significant events observed. The probability of an MRLS event is, all other things being equal, directly related to the proportion of cardiac output delivered to the tissue in question. This accounts for the very rapid (36-hr) onset of the high-dose LFL events, the much slower rate of onset of EFL events, due to the much smaller size and correspondingly smaller portion of cardiac output going to the early term fetus. The proportion of cardiac output going to a single eye is clearly very small, accounting for the very small incidence (estimated at one per 60,000 equine eyes in central Kentucky) of the unique single-eye events. In fact, based on the incidence of single-eye events, estimates of the actual number of circulating setal fragments on the order of ten per day, the small number of which accounts for the lack of clinical signs in ETC MRLS horses and the difficulty in culturing bacteria from the bloodstream of MRLS mares. The pathogenesis of MRLS was found to depend simply on the mechanical properties of the barbed setal fragments and their ability to transport bacterial pathogens through the cardiovascular system and distribute them by tissue penetration to poorly immune-protected tissues such as the early and late fetus, the eye, and the pericardial fluid. As such, setal fragment penetration could well be an ancient defense mechanism of caterpillars, and given that possibility, MRLS-like syndromes might well be found in association with other caterpillar species. This proposed pathogenesis, SPSE hypothesis of MRLS, was communicated privately among colleagues and university administrators, and then publicly at the Bain Fallon lectures, the Gold Coast, Australia, July 2002, and the following month to participants the First International Symposium on the Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome. In 2003 (Memorial Day Weekend), compelling statistical evidence in support of this probabilistic mechanism developed when a combined analysis of 2012 and 2013 LFL abortion rate data showed their time courses closely followed a probabilistic mathematical equation called accelerated failure time model (AFT). This AFT analysis was immediately written up as a toxicokinetic analysis of MRLS, shared in draft form with colleagues prior to submission for publication, and the full SPSE hypothesis was next written up and published immediately thereafter. At about this time during the fall of 2003, colleagues who had been provided the prepublication draft of the AFT analysis paper were performing necropsies on pigs that had been dosed with ETCs. They noted the intestinal tracts of these pigs showed large numbers of intestinal microgranulomas, each encasing an ETC setal fragment. Discussing rumors of these findings with Dr. Terry Fitzgerald, he noted that similar intestinal microgranulomas had been observed previously in ETC-dosed rats by colleagues experimenting with ETCs, and he shared some H and E section of such a rat intestinal ETC setal microgranuloma slides for inclusion in a second paper. The SPSE hypothesis included intestinal penetration and presumably lethal peritonitis as one logical outcome of intestinal exposure to ETC septic penetrating setal fragments. One may reasonably assume that all living possessors of intestinal tracts have an evolutionarily well-developed and effective defense to intestinal exposure to insult such as ETC setal fragments and/or equivalent structures. The completely consistent and logical nature of the defense mechanism, namely encapsulation of the penetrating fragment in connective tissue so that the tissue movements driving fragment movement are effectively minimized and peristalsis-driven migration of the fragment is thereby prevented. The AFT model, while first developed to describe mechanical failure, has been applied frequently to biological and medical situations. In most toxicological models, the effect is proportional to concentration of toxin or amount of insult. However, in the AFT model, both effect (abortion) and the time to effect are dependent on concentration. This statistical model fit MRLS data which showed abortions occurred rapidly and in higher frequencies at high doses of ETCs, and the onset of abortions was delayed and abortions occurred with lower frequency at low doses. A simple intuitive model of AFT analysis is to imagine what happens when a person armed with a machine gun appears at the door of a crowded ballroom and shoots randomly into the room. Sooner or later, everybody in the ballroom will be killed. However, if the shooter just happens to be shooting very slowly, then the time to the first death will be relatively longer and the frequency of hits is low, which is of course the longer \\"lag time period\\" and low frequency one sees with MRLS in a normal year when the caterpillars are rare (or an experimental dose of caterpillars is small). However, if the shooter is shooting very fast, then the time to first death is very short and frequency of death is high, equivalent to the very short time to first abortions and high frequency of abortions when caterpillar exposure is unusually high, as happened in Kentucky in 2001 (or if the experimental dose of caterpillars is high). When exposure to the caterpillars is high, the first abortions occur very soon after first exposure, drawing immediate attention to the link between the caterpillars and the abortions. This random shooting model is also relevant to the single eyes. A disease of the eyes will usually affect both eyes, but single-eye events were seen with MRLS. With the gun analogy, the probability of any individual being hit in an eye is small; however, the probability of an individual being hit in both eyes is vanishingly small. The shooting model, therefore, explains the unique single-eye events of MRLS, perhaps the single most unusual and initially confounding characteristic of the entire MRLS syndrome. MRLS- related syndromes around the world When the SPSE mechanism explaining MRLS was identified, it was immediately apparent that the model might be an ancient defensive mechanism of caterpillars, and that MRLS-like syndromes might well exist and be identified elsewhere. In 2004, Dr. Thomas Tobin was contacted by a horse farmer in NSW, Australia, who was faced with what she believed were caterpillar-related abortions on her farm in eastern Australia. She put Tobin in touch with the investigating veterinarian, Dr. Nigel Perkins, who at that time understood the Kentucky MRLS outbreak to be black cherry tree/cyanide- driven. Advice to Dr. Perkins was brief and unequivocal‚Äîgiven the similarities between MRLS and the syndrome he was describing and the possible role of caterpillars in his syndrome, his experimental approaches should be to first test the caterpillars, any and all other abortigenic candidates, test second. Following this advice, the recommended caterpillar administration experiments were performed and the local processionary caterpillar was identified as the cause of the Australian caterpillar-driven abortion syndrome, which was named \\"Equine Amnionitis and Fetal Loss.\\" A further indication of the possible ubiquity of caterpillar-related abortions comes from the western Sahara, where traditional camel pastoralists/herders have long known that pregnant camels exposed to caterpillars are at high likelihood of abortion or birth in a condition similar to the late-term MRLS fetuses. In the western Sahara, the condition is known as duda, the local term for caterpillar, and the link to the caterpillar is very well understood in the local Saharan camel pastoralist cultures. Considering the difficulty that certain groups in Kentucky had in accepting the theory of caterpillars causing MRLS, the long-time familiarity of a traditional camel-herding culture with the concept of caterpillar-driven abortions is interesting. Prevention and treatment Because the black cherry tree is the preferred host tree for the eastern tent caterpillar, one approach to prevention is to simply remove the trees from the vicinity of horse farms, which was one of the first recommendations made concerning MRLS. Next, because the brief time for which the full-grown ETCs are on the ground in the vicinity of pregnant mares, simply keeping pregnant mares out of contact with them is also an effective preventative mechanism. In this regard, one Kentucky horse farm took the approach of simply muzzling mares during an ETC exposure period, an approach which was reportedly effective. No effective treatment for MRLS is apparent. Mares which aborted are treated with broad- spectrum antibiotics to avoid bacterial infections. The foals born from mares infected with MRLS are given supportive care and supplied with medication to reduce inflammatory response and improve blood flow, but none of the treatments appears to be effective, as the majority of the foals do not survive. Unilateral uveitis is treated symptomatically with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs.

He ranked among the most successful sportsmen of its discipline, particularly in the 1990s. Funaki is known for his special variant of the V-style, in which the body lies flatter between the skis than usual. Career Funaki began ski jumping at the age of eleven. His birthplace Yoichi is also the home of Yukio Kasaya, who was a Japanese national hero with his Normal Hill victory in the 1972 Winter Olympics at Sapporo. Kasaya was also Funaki's role model. Funaki had his first World Cup appearance on December 20, 1992 in Sapporo. His first World Cup victory was achieved on December 10, 1994 in the normal hill at Planica, Slovenia. Several weeks later, he was leading the Four Hills Tournament in total tour points after the third event. In the second part of the last event at Bischofshofen, he had the longest jump of 131.5 meters, but fell during the landing - and the overall tour victory went to Austrian Andreas Goldberger, and Funaki finished second. Altogether Funaki won 15 World Cup career victories, his last on February 5, 2005 at Sapporo. He achieved his best results in the 1997/98 season with a second rank in the World Cup rankings. In that season he also won the Four Hills Tournament. In 1997, Funaki won the ski jumping event at the Holmenkollen ski festival. He also won the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 1998 in Oberstdorf. The high point of his career was in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games at Nagano. In front of his local crowd, Funaki won the individual gold medal on the individual large Hill, the team large hill gold medal, and the individual normal hill silver medal behind the Finn Jani Soininen. During those games, he became only the second person to ever achieve perfect marks from all five judges (20 points is the highest attainable mark), following Toni Innauer who had achieved this masterpiece already in 1976 and preceding Sven Hannawald (2003), Hideharu Miyahira (2003) and Wolfgang Loitzl (2009). In honor of these achievements, he represented Asia in carrying the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremonies of the next Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City. At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, he became the world champion of the individual normal hill in 1999 at Ramsau, Austria. And together with the Japanese team, he placed 2nd in the Team large hill in 1997, 1999 and 2003. For his ski jumping successes, Funaki received the Holmenkollen medal in 1999. While he does not compete in World Cup or Continental Cup events, Funaki still takes part in local Japanese competitions. In March 2019 he finished 10th and 42nd in FIS Race events in Sapporo.

He was Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the University of Rochester.Nelson Polsby, \\"The Contributions of President Richard F. Fenno Jr\\". PS ‚Äì Political Science & Politics (1984). 17#4: 778‚Äì781. He published numerous books and scholarly articles focused on how members of Congress interacted with each other, with committees, and with constituents. Political scientists considered the research groundbreaking and startlingly original and gave him numerous awards. Many followed his research design on how to follow members from Washington back to their home districts. Fenno was best known for identifying the tendency ‚Äî dubbed \\"Fenno‚Äôs Paradox\\" ‚Äî of how most voters say they dislike Congress as a whole, but they trust and reelect their local Congressman. Schudel, 2020. Biography Fenno grew up in Boston and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he graduated from Amherst College in 1948 and completed a Ph.D. degree in political science under William Yandell Elliott at Harvard University in 1956. Fenno moved in 1958 to the University of Rochester where he spent his career. He wrote about Republicans and Democrats and explored rural, urban and African American congressional districts in depth. An independent who never publicized his personal political views, he never endorsed any candidates. Fenno's books Congressmen in Committees (1973) and Home Style: House Members in Their Districts (1978) (for which he won the first D. B. Hardeman Prize) established him as a leading scholar of American politics. With William Riker, Fenno built the reputation of Rochester's political science department. Riker focused on positive political science, while Fenno focused on establishing Rochester as a center for congressional studies. He built the first internship program for undergraduates to work in Congress.Schudel, 2020. Fenno's trademark style of political science research is sometimes referred to as \\"Soak and Poke\\" (see Fenno 1986). Rather than relying primarily on data sets or rational choice theory, Fenno undertook empirical observation of the movements of political actors on the stage of politics. His most famous book Home Style is written in this fashion. Fenno won the American Political Science Association's (APSA) Woodrow Wilson Award for the best book in political science in 1978 for Home Style. In 1996, the Association for Budgeting & Financial Management awarded Fenno its Aaron Wildavsky Award for Lifetime Scholarly Achievement in Public Budgeting, for his work on Congress and appropriations. Congress at the Grassroots won the 2001 V. O. Key Award for the best book on southern politics. Fenno served as book review editor of the American Political Science Review (1968‚Äì1971), as a director of the Social Science Research Council, and as president of APSA (1984‚Äì1985). He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Since 1986, APSA's Legislative Studies Section has awarded the Richard F. Fenno Jr. Prize for the best book on legislative studies. Fenno's archival collection is housed at the University of Rochester's River Campus Libraries Department of Rare Books, Special Collections, and Preservation. Research interview and oral history notes are also housed at the National Archives and Records Administration's Center for Legislative Activities. According to Norman J. Ornstein: :Fenno was hands down the most significant student of Congress of the last half of the 20th century. He was the first to note that voters loved their congressman while hating Congress, he wrote the definitive study of the appropriations process (‚ÄúThe Power of the Purse‚Äù) and a series of books where he explored the relationship between legislators at home and in Washington. Fenno died in Westchester County, New York on April 21, 2020 from the effects of the COVID-19.

Run on a voluntary basis using funds from the Students' Union, the magazine is available free to students. Impact also publishes a website, which has been online since 8 January 2006, and an app, which was launched in 2016.

The Guardian panel in 2001 described Impact as having \\"great design and great articles that brilliantly reflected its student readership but could have been a real stand-alone magazine\\". History The Gong, launched in 1895 was the University of Nottingham's first foray into the world of student journalism. A polished literary pamphlet, it published the students‚Äô own stories, poems and literary reviews. The Granddad of the students‚Äô creative voice continued for decades alongside its news-based rival, The Gongster, which was launched in 1939 and after several image changes eventually became Impact. The paper suffered many teething problems, coming under fire for being \\"too serious and stodgy\\". The publication also faced difficulties when war broke out, resulting in a print reduction as the country encountered a serious paper shortage. In 1941 Gongster was suspended throughout the summer months due to a lack of funding, given the restrictions imposed on all societies by the SU as the full effects of rationing took their toll. It was only by 1947 that the paper finally found its feet, selling 100% of copies. As the paper hit the 1980s it was decided that Gongster was long due a shake-up and soon became Bias. The new name, coupled with an edgier, aesthetically pleasing design, lasted only five years when someone concluded the paper would be better served as Impact. Still a newspaper and still partially funding itself, at ten pence a copy, Impact promised to be more adventurous. Impact subsequently changed into a magazine, which remains in the same format with an ever increasing number of pages. Impact released its 200th issue during its 70th birthday year on 30 November 2009.

The unicameral National Assembly has 125 deputies: previously 100 members were elected for five-year terms in single-seat constituencies and 25 were members elected by proportional representation; as of the latest election, however, all 125 deputies are returned from single-member constituencies. Milli Majlis was the first secular republican parliament in the Muslim world. History =Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918‚Äì1920)= First meeting of the Azerbaijani Parliament Parliament in 1918 Following the Russian Revolution in February 1917, a special committee consisting of deputies from Transcaucasian State Duma was created. In November, Transcaucasian Commissariat was created as the first government of independent Transcaucasia. The Sejm made up from representatives of three nations did not have a solid political platform as each nation looked after its own interests. This subsequently led to dissolution of the Sejm on May 25, 1918. On May 27, 44 Muslim deputies of the Sejm gathered in Tbilisi and established Azerbaijan National Council to form the government of Azerbaijan. Mammad Emin Rasulzade was elected its chairman. On May 28, the National Council passed a resolution proclaiming independence of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. On June 16, the National Council and the Azerbaijani government moved to Ganja. At the seventh session of the council in Ganja chaired by Mammad Emin Rasulzade, it was decided to dissolve the council and transfer all legislative and executive power to the interim government of Azerbaijan headed by Fatali Khan Khoyski. Once the government was established, Azerbaijani was made the official state language. One of the priorities of the government before moving to Baku was to liberate Baku from Centrocaspian Dictatorship then in control of the city which took place on September 15, 1918. On November 16 when the National Council reconvenes and on November 19, Rasulzade announces that all nationalities of Azerbaijan will be represented in the Azerbaijani Parliament to consist of 120 deputies. Therefore, basing on 24 thousand representatives of nationalities of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani parliament made up from 80 Muslims, 21 Armenians, 10 Russians, 1 German and 1 Jew was established on November 29 and convened on December 7, 1918. Thus, the first session of the parliament took place in the building of former Zeynalabdin Tagiyev Russian Muslim School located on present day Istiglaliyyat Street of Baku and was chaired by Rasulzade. Alimardan Topchubashov was elected the Speaker of the Parliament, Hasanbey Agayev - Deputy Speaker. By the end of 1919, there were 11 various political party factions in the parliament represented by 96 deputies. During its 17-month existence, the parliament held 145 sessions with the last session being convened on April 27, 1920 on the eve of Russian occupation of Azerbaijan. A total of 270 resolutions were sponsored, 230 of which were passed. Parliamentary delegations of Azerbaijan signed several friendship treaties with Turkey, Iran, Great Britain, and US and a defense pact with Georgia; attended Paris Peace Conference several times requesting recognition from Western countries. In January 1920, Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was de facto recognized by the Peace Conference. =Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR= During the last session of Azerbaijani Parliament on April 27, 1920 under pressure of the Bolshevik Russian 11th Red Army and ultimatum from Caucasian Committee of the Russian Communist Party which invaded Azerbaijan, the deputies decided to disband the government in favour of the Bolsheviks to avoid bloodshed. Once the Bolsheviks took over, they abolished all structures of the Azerbaijani government and established the Azerbaijan Interim Revolutionary Committee administered by Azerbaijani communists Nariman Narimanov, Aliheydar Garayev, Gazanfar Musabekov, Hamid Sultanov and Dadash Bunyadzade. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Azerbaijani Army, executed its generals and officers, and nationalized private industries. In May 1921, the first All-Azerbaijan Soviet Session made up of newly elected deputies from all regions of Azerbaijan convened in Baku. The elected deputies were mainly drawn from poor, uneducated, unprepared factory workers and villagers which facilitated complete rule from Moscow. The first session established the Azerbaijan Central Executive Committee consisting of 75 members and its board with 13 members. From 1921 through 1937, nine sessions of All-Azerbaijan Soviets were convened. In 1937, during the 9th session of the All-Azerbaijani Soviets a new Azerbaijan SSR Constitution was ratified and the new legislative body the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR was established. The first elections to Supreme Soviet took place on June 24, 1938. Out of 310 deputies elected, 107 were workers, 88 collective farmers and 115 educated civil servants. Seventy two of the deputies were women. Due to the authoritarian nature of Soviet rule where most new initiatives were met as conspiracies against the state, the parliament was virtually ineffective. Due to multiple reforms and restructuring in the government of the Azerbaijan SSR in the 1970s-1980s, the role of the Supreme Soviet increased. Many legislative reforms including the ratification of the new Azerbaijan SSR Constitution of 1977 took place. After the demands of the Armenian SSR to transfer the NKAO region of Azerbaijan to Armenia, the parliament was largely passive and indifferent. On October 18, 1991 the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution confirming the restoration of the independence of Azerbaijan. Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan The building of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan The first Azerbaijani parliamentary election was held in late 1990, when the Supreme Soviet already held discussions on independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union. The 1995 parliamentary election was the first to be held after restoration of Azerbaijan's independence. The assembly is headed by its Speaker assisted by the First Deputy Speaker and two deputy speakers. Ogtay Asadov is the current speaker of the assembly, Ziyafet Asgarov is the First Deputy Speaker and, Bahar Muradova and Valeh Alasgarov are deputy speakers. The work at the parliament is administered by the Parliament Apparatus headed by Sefa Mirzayev, aided by Assistant Manager Elkhan Ahmadov. The Parliament Apparatus is subdivided into Department of State Roster for Territorial Units and Municipalities, and Codification Sector Department. First session of the National Assembly in 1918 In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling New Azerbaijan Party strengthened its grasp on the legislature, securing a majority of 73 out of 125 seats. The other seats went to nominally independent, government-leaning candidates, and to \\"soft opposition\\" parties. The two major opposition parties (Musavat and the Parties of the People's Front of Azerbaijan) lost their previous eight seats, thus resulting in an opposition-free Parliament. The Central Election Commission said turnout was 50.1%, out of a total 4.9 million people eligible to vote. Opposition leaders suggested the low turnout was due to candidate disqualifications by the CEC, and consequent discouragements to vote after their choice of candidate was excluded. The United States declared that the elections \\"did not meet international standards\\", while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, EU and Council of Europe highlighted some positive aspects, while stating that \\"the conduct of the elections did not represent significant progress in the process of the country‚Äôs democratic development\\". 2015 Parliamentary elections resulted in 72 seats won by ruling party. Currently Parliament consists of 15 parliamentary committees: *Legal Policies and State Structuring Committee, chaired by first deputy speaker of the parliament, MP Ali Huseynli *Defense and Security Committee, chaired by MP Ziyafet Asgarov *Economic Policies Committee, chaired by MP Tahir Mirkishili *Committee on Natural Resources, Energy and Ecology, chaired by MP Sadig Gurbanov *Committee on Agrarian Policies, chaired by MP Tahir Rzayev *Social Policies Committee, chaired by MP Musa Guliyev *Committee on Regional Issues, chaired by MP Siyavush Novruzov *Committee on Science and Education, chaired by MP Bakhtiyar Aliyev *Committee on Cultural Issues, chaired by MP Ganira Pashayeva *Committee on Public Unions and Religious entities, chaired by deputy speaker of the Parliament, MP Fazail Ibrahimli *Committee on Youth and Sport, chaired by deputy speaker of the Parliament, MP Adil Aliyev *Committee on Health Issues, chaired by MP Ahliman Emiraslanov *Committee on Family, Women and Children affairs, chaired by MP Hijran Huseynova *International and Interparliamentary Relations Committee, chaired by MP Samad Seyidov *Human Rights Committee, chaired by MP Zahid Oruj In addition to the parliamentary committees, Milli Majlis has a Chamber of Accounting, Toponyms and Disciplinary Commissions. The Disciplinary Commission is chaired by MP Eldar Ibrahimov. The parliament publishes its own newspaper, Az…ôrbaycan q…ôzeti (Azerbaijan newspaper), widely distributed around the country. Parliament also established more than 80 \\"Interparliamentary working groups\\" with the parliaments of more than 80 states in the world.

The basic gameplay mechanics of the original game remain the same. The player controls an empire with the goal of conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other. Although set in a similar historical period and geographical area to the unmodified game (covering a timespan of 272 BC to 14 AD, compared to the original game's 270 BC to 14 AD), Europa Barbarorum is a total conversion modification as it replaces all the aspects of the original Rome: Total War game that can be replaced, such as unit models, statistics and the musical score. The modification has received favourable reviews in a number of computer gaming magazines. PC Gamer magazine ranks Europa Barbarorum as the best mod for any of the seven Total War games released for the PC at that time.  Gameplay  In the original Rome: Total War, the player took control of an empire, or \\"faction\\", of classical Europe, North Africa or the Middle East, with the aim of expanding their faction's territory and eliminating rival empires through military conquest and city-building. Europa Barbarorum retains this basic gameplay mechanic and sets itself in a similar time period and geographical area to the original game. However, as a total conversion the mod replaces the particular factions, military units, buildings, and other elements present in the original game, and adds a new soundtrack and several brand-new gameplay mechanics not present in the original, such as the installation of puppet rulers. The modification's development team's stated aim in making the changes that they have to Rome: Total War is to make the player's experience of the ancient world more historically accurate. For this reason, numerous parameters of the game at the start of the campaign in 272 BC, such as generals' names, the diplomatic relations between factions, and the particular understanding of the outside world that each faction has, have been set to correspond to the actual political situation in that year. Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude, factions, provinces on the campaign map and factions' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum, rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones, as in Rome: Total War. So, for instance, the original game's Armenia faction is known as Hayasdan in Europa Barbarorum, and Germania as the Sweboz. Instead of having to play one's first campaign as a Roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non-Romans by defeating them in the Roman campaign, all twenty of Europa Barbarorums playable factions can be accessed by the player from the start. Furthermore, the one unplayable and three playable Roman factions of the original have been combined into a single playable faction in Europa Barbarorum, the Romani. Dissatisfied with the homogeneity of the factions of the original Rome: Total War, the Europa Barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate the playing experiences of the game's different factions. So, for example, Rome: Total Wars trait-acquisition system, where the player's faction's family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership, has been made more faction-specific in Europa Barbarorum, with Hellenic characters' traits, for instance, being based on Theophrastos' Characters and Aristotle's teachings on the Golden Mean, and Romans' traits being partially based on the moral tales of Valerius Maximus. There are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait: in order for them to compete in one of the Panhellenic Games, for instance, the player must ensure that they are stationed in the appropriate city on the campaign map in the year that the competition is scheduled to take place. One reviewer has commented that Europa Barbarorums expansions upon the original Rome: Total Wars trait system have served to add a role-playing element to the game. = Campaign = The Europa Barbarorum world map, correct for version 1.1 As in the original Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn- based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of the original Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital that either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city, such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city at the same time as undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions. The campaign map itself of Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area than that of Rome: Total War, expanding into areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile‚ÄìRed Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added to the map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence. The selection of factions present in the original Rome: Total War has been overhauled in Europa Barbarorum. The original game's Gaul faction has been replaced with two new factions, the Aedui and the Arverni. The Scythia faction has been replaced by the Sauromatae, and the Greek Cities faction (which included various city-states) has been replaced by the Koinon Hellenon (), a faction which represents the Chremonidean League of Athens, Sparta and Rhodes. Entirely new factions include Baktria, a Central Asian Hellenic empire, and Epeiros, a western Greek faction famous for producing Pyrrhos of Epiros. On the other hand, the Numidia faction of Rome: Total War was removed entirely. A diagram of the possible development of the governments of nomadic factions in Europa Barbarorum The way in which factions enhance the provinces they own through the construction of new buildings in their province capitals has changed in Europa Barbarorum. The process of assimilating a newly conquered province into one's empire has become more differentiated in the modification than it was in the original game through the introduction of so-called \\"government buildings\\" and military‚Äìindustrial complexes. Government buildings represent different degrees of central State intervention in a province, and range from a homeland government, which can only be built in a faction's traditional ethnic homeland and represents the highest possible degree of central State control, to an allied state government, which makes the province in question semi-autonomous and installs a puppet ruler to govern it on the controlling faction's behalf. The choice of government building in a province affects what other buildings can be constructed there: the greater the degree of autonomy granted to a province, the greater the shift in the make-up of the pool of buildings available for construction from the controlling faction's own buildings to native buildings; that is, buildings which are more closely associated with the faction that would make its traditional home in the province in question, rather than the one currently occupying it. Nomadic, desert- and steppe-dwelling factions have their own government buildings, which some say has helped differentiate between Europa Barbarorums factions and make the differences between Europa Barbarorum and the original Rome: Total War more than just cosmetic. These government buildings also affect unit recruitment options in a province, through the mod's introduction of military‚Äìindustrial complex (\\"MIC\\") buildings. The original Rome: Total Wars system of constructing and subsequently upgrading different types of building in order to recruit different types of soldier (stables for horses, ranges for archers, and so on) has been replaced in Europa Barbarorum by the \\"factional MIC\\", which enables the recruitment of all the province-controlling faction's units, and the \\"regional MIC\\", which enables the recruitment of native types of soldier. How far the two types of complexes can be upgraded depends on the government of the province: the greater the autonomy of the province, the more the native MIC may be upgraded, and the less the factional MIC may be upgraded; and vice versa. In addition to buildings that can be constructed by the player, Europa Barbarorum also introduces a number of unique buildings or \\"wonders\\", which can either be man-made structures or features of the landscape, and which provide unique bonuses to the province. = Warfare = If, during their turn on the campaign map, the player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction's army, or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during the AI's turn, the player then has the option of fighting a real-time battle or siege. In this gameplay mode, the player directs the troops they had brought with them on the campaign map to the engagement, ordering them to manoeuvre and attack the enemy's troops on a three-dimensional battlefield. Troops can either be killed outright on the battlefield or made to rout and flee the field if their morale falls below a certain threshold. Reviewers have noted of Rome: Total War that, during a battle, troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations; other factors such as individual unit types' strengths and soldiers' morale and fatigue at the point of fighting are also taken into account. A battle is won when one side kills or routs the entire enemy army; a siege may be won by the attacking side through either dispatching the opposing forces or gaining control of the besieged city's central plaza for a certain number of minutes, and by the defending side either by killing the attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach the city's defences. The make-up of the game's units is one of the areas in which the most change can be seen going from the original game to the mod. Reviewers have commented that the differences between Europa Barbarorum and its parent game are \\"immediate\\" and \\"striking\\" and that the modification is different from its parent game \\"in look and in play\\". Another reviewer described the mod as having a more \\"gritty, realistic look\\" than the original Rome: Total War. All the units that were present in the original game have been removed and replaced in Europa Barbarorum. Specific examples include the removal of several units that the Europa Barbarorum team considered to be historically doubtful or only marginally used in warfare, such as Arcani, incendiary pigs and Celtic head- hurlers from the original Rome: Total War. Nor was the modding team happy with the way more conventional forces were portrayed in the original game, for instance calling Rome: Total Wars Egyptian soldiers \\"Mummy Returns Egyptians\\" and hence creating a new unit roster for the Egyptian faction in the game (named Egypt in the original Rome: Total War and the Ptolemaioi in Europa Barbarorum), in order to better correspond with the Ptolemaic period of history. The mod also features new custom battle formations in order to encourage more realistic behaviour from the AI.  Audio  Europa Barbarorum features its own soundtrack, distinct from that of Rome: Total War. Some of its tracks were composed especially by Morgan Casey and Nick Wylie; others are examples of authentic music, the Celtic factions' tracks, for example, having been recorded by early music ensemble Prehistoric Music Ireland. Europa Barbarorum also includes its own \\"voicemod\\", an attempt by the developers to replace the English cries of Rome: Total Wars soldiers with ones in their native languages, which include classical Latin, Celtic, and ancient Greek.  Development  The Europa Barbarorum project began in January 2004, eight months before Rome: Total Wars release, when the Europa Barbarorum development team who were following the game's development became concerned that its \\"barbarian\\" factions such as the Gauls were being portrayed inaccurately. The Europa Barbarorum team felt that such factions' representations in Rome: Total War conformed more to a Hollywood stereotype than to historical fact, and wished to see a more realistic portrayal of such factions in the game. The modding team tried to convince the Creative Assembly (CA), the developers of Rome: Total War, to alter their depiction of the period in line with the team's research, but the developers failed to take them up on their offer. Having exhausted this avenue for change, the Europa Barbarorum members then resolved to modify the game themselves upon its release.  Release  Europa Barbarorum was first released to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006, which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military‚Äìindustrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases during the first half of 2007, which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80‚Äì0.81 versions were tracked. The next major release was version 1.0, which was released in October 2007 and included new units, new government options for the Pahlava and Hayasdan factions, the addition of a new type of wall to the battle map and new music from prehistoric music group Prehistoric Music Ireland. The 1.0 version was downloaded over 90,000 times in the six months following its release. This was followed by version 1.1, which was released in April 2008 and included new battle map landscapes, new units, the addition of the Pahlavi voicemod and the inclusion of an introduction video for the Saka Rauka faction. The current release is version 1.2, which contains the addition of the Punic voicemod and bug fixes; the development team had previously stated that future releases of Europa Barbarorum for the Rome: Total War engine will not include any major gameplay changes. Europa Barbarorum has seen some significant changes to its campaign over the course of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba. Following the main modification's release, a number of customisations of Europa Barbarorum have been created, such as porting it to run using the Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion executable, or Feral Interactive's Mac OS X version of Rome: Total War. There had been plans to release a version of the mod for the PC game Europa Universalis: Rome, but no Europa Barbarorum mod has yet been released for the strategy title. = Europa Barbarorum II = The Europa Barbarorum development team also developed a new version of the modification for the Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms engine, which was named Europa Barbarorum II. The modification was designed to take advantage of the improved graphics of Medieval II: Total War and of its engine's additional features, such as the possibility of different soldiers within the same unit to have different appearances, as opposed to the \\"clones\\" criticised by some reviewers of Rome: Total War. Europa Barbarorum II includes new government, unit recruitment and trait systems, and new playable factions such as the kingdom of Gandhara, which has its own Sanskrit voicemod. An initial version of Europa Barbarorum II v2.0 was released on 25 August 2014, with a second version (v2.01) released on 12 September 2014. On 21 December 2015, a third version (2.1b) was released and provided a number of improvements, such as an improved campaign AI/battle AI, remodelled battle map settlements, battle map vegetation, and new units with military reforms for various factions. Version 2.2b, which was released on 4 June 2016, contained the same new improvements.  Reception  Europa Barbarorum was featured and reviewed in a number of video game magazines. It has been reviewed in PC Gamer UK twice, in March 2005 and February 2008. The 2008 review was overwhelmingly positive, saying that \\"EB feels like a whole new Total War game\\", and going on to praise the modification's \\"stunning\\" scope and the \\"striking\\" extent of the differences between it and Rome: Total War. The review was somewhat critical of the modification's graphical user interfaces which \\"[occasionally]\\" had a \\"home-made\\" feel to them, as well as its lack of accessibility and steep learning curve, although it adds that the second point is not a large problem as the modification is largely a \\"master's challenge for accomplished Rome players\\". The review finished on a positive note, summing Europa Barbarorum up as a \\"superior game\\". In 2010, the same magazine's website named Europa Barbarorum the best mod of any Total War game. A number of non-English language magazines have also reviewed Europa Barbarorum. The Italian PC Gaming magazine Giochi per il mio computer reviewed the modification in April 2005 and March 2008. The 2005 review reported that the modification, whose development team included two historians, was to replace the \\"economic system, [soldiers'] equipment and the provinces\\" of Rome: Total War; the latter review praised the mod for having \\"altered and deepened\\" the gameplay of the original title, and wrote that Europa Barbarorum was the best substitute for a Rome 2: Total War game prior to the actual release of such a title. Dutch magazine , reviewing the mod in March 2008, also wrote that the mod was \\"perhaps the best candidate for the title Rome: Total War II\\" \\"until the official announcement\\" and went on to note that the list of changes that the modification had made to the original game almost constituted \\"a history book of its own\\". The German magazine GameStar wrote in April 2007 that the Europa Barbarorum team had \\"banned all historical mistakes from the game\\"; in January 2011, another German publication, PC Games, also noted the mod's historical accuracy, singling out its \\"more realistic, more [challenging]\\" battles for praise, although it did note that the mod was squarely aimed at experienced Rome: Total War players. Reviewing version 0.74 of the mod in November 2006, Romanian publication LeveL concurred that the mod was aimed at experienced players, adding that the modified version of the game put greater demands on the player's computer than the original Rome: Total War, requiring 512 MB of RAM, up from the original's 256. Despite this, the reviewer praised the mod's complexity, the \\"painstaking detail\\" that went into making the units and the mod's soundtrack. Europa Barbarorum has also received several online reviews. The modification received a review early into its development process on gaming website HeavenGames, which said that it was an \\"ambitious\\" project and praised its commitment to historical accuracy, even stating that the Europa Barbarorum development team was going to use satellite imagery and climate change statistics to accurately portray the world as it was in 272 BC. Later, in 2008, the modification has been reviewed on Boomtown, which praised the modification's \\"incredibly well-researched and -devised\\" unit stats system, as well as its \\"legion of historians\\". The modification has sometimes been mentioned as a recommended complement to Rome: Total War in reviews of the original title ‚Äì for instance, by Norwegian gaming website Gamereactor in 2007. In addition, Europa Barbarorum was singled out for praise by the Creative Assembly themselves in 2011, when they called the mod \\"breathtaking\\" in an official statement.
