He united the County of Bordeaux with the Gascony. Documents of his reign state that his grandfather came from Iberia, lending credence to \\"phantasmagorical\\" genealogies placing the origins of Garc√≠a II S√°nchez across the Pyrenees.Higounet, p 44. He died in 996 or 997 and was succeeded by his son, Bernard William. Around 970, William was using only the title of count as when \\"Lord William S√°nchez, count of the Gascons\\"Dominus Willelmus Sancii comes Gasconiorum. donated land in the village of \\"Luco Deo\\" to the monastery of Saint Vincent-de-Lucq. He inherited the county of Bordeaux from his cousin William the Good, son of his aunt Entregodis, who married one Raymond, and united it to Gascony permanently. He later carried the ducal title. Aimoin entitled him \\"Count of Bordeaux and duke of all Gascony\\"Burdegalensium comes et ac totius Guasconiae dux. in his biography of Abbo of Fleury. Before 977, William also added the Agenais and the Bazadais. This expansion of the duchy was probably the cause of an increase in our information about the region and its dukes after a period of obscurity lasting from the Viking raids of the 840s. In 977, William restored the priory of La R√©ole, using the title of dux Wasconum (Duke of Gascony). He was not at that time employing the title Count of Bordeaux. He was in possession of Bordeaux by 988, when he sought the advice of the council of seniores (\\"lords\\") of Bordeaux for the restoration of the monastery of Saint- Sever. While Gascony had long been out of the orbit of the French kings, Bordeaux had not been. With its acquisition, William began dating his charters by the reign of the king, Hugh Capet (987‚Äì96), with the clause \\"King Hugh reigning\\" (regnante rege Hugone). During the reign of William II, his brother Gombald, the \\"Bishop of the Gascons\\", established control over all the dioceses in Gascony and eventually became Archbishop of Bordeaux. The entire Gascon church hierarchy was controlled by William's family. When William travelled to Navarre to join the Reconquista and combat Muslims, he left Gombald in charge in Gascony. In Navarre he acquired a wife, but was forced to return to Gascony as Viking raids became increasingly serious. He defeated the Vikings at Taller in 981 or 982, and they ceased to be a serious threat after that. Their permanent settlements along the Adour were removed and they were driven back into the north, the pays de Born-Landes. William might be the \\"Count William S√°nchez\\" who, according to Sampiro, defeated the Vikings in Galicia in 970. No Galiciam of that name is known from the 10th century, but neither is there any other record of William S√°nchez travelling to Galicia. It has been proposed, however, that the duke of Gascony was on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint James at Compostela when, in an emergency, he took command of the defences during a Viking attack.Christys, 84; Gonz√°lez L√≥pez, 105; Fletcher, 81. Family William married Urraca Garc√©s (died before 1008), a daughter of king Garc√≠a S√°nchez I of Pamplona (927‚Äì70) and widow of count Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile. They had three children: * Bernard, succeeded his father. * Sancho VI, later ruled Gascony as well. * Brisca (Prisca) married duke William V of Aquitaine as his second wife and brought a claim on Gascony to the House of Poitiers, which eventually passed to them, in the person of Brisca's son Odo on the death of Sancho VI.Lewis, 348. William may have been the father (or uncle) of Gersenda, who married Henry I, Duke of Burgundy. He may also have fathered Toda, who married Bernard I of Besal√∫, who otherwise may have been the daughter of William II of Provence. Notes Sources Primary sources *Aimoin.

The series was produced by Dick Clark Productions and its music provided by Scooter Pietsch. Format The show was set to look like it took place on the backstage side of another TV show, and generally had an intentionally \\"cheap\\" feel meant to distinguish it from equivalent programs. There was a coffee maker behind the host and members of the audience were encouraged to get up in the middle of the show and get themselves a cup of coffee. Guests on the show were encouraged to sign a styrofoam cup and bite the cup to leave a dental record for future identification if needed. The cups of all guests where displayed on the wall behind the host. Each show included calling a local L.A. restaurant and ordering food for the audience members.

It was established in the 1870s by developer James O. Woodruff as an early suburb of Indianapolis. Woodruff Place's boundaries are: 10th Street on the north, Woodruff Place West Drive on the west, Michigan Street on the south, and Woodruff Place East Drive on the east. This community was an independent municipality and maintained autonomy, even as the City of Indianapolis grew and expanded around the neighborhood, enclosing the community well within the city limits. Woodruff Place was incorporated in 1876 and remained an independent town until 1962 when it became one of the final municipalities to be annexed by the City of Indianapolis prior to the merger of city and county governments in 1969. Woodruff Place is bounded on the west by the campus of Arsenal Technical High School, which opened in 1912 on the former site of the Indianapolis Arsenal, and which still uses several historic buildings from the arsenal. Woodruff Place was once considered to be one of Indianapolis's more affluent neighborhoods before beginning a gradual decline as the automobile led to the development of newer upscale subdivisions beginning in the late 1910s. By the 1950s many of the grand homes had been subdivided into apartments; previously, the neighborhood had only a modest collection of duplexes and smaller apartment buildings which were added beginning in the early 1910s. The neighborhood reached its lowest point in the 1960s, prompting community organizing in the early 1970s to encourage neighborhood revitalization. The 1980s and 1990s saw extensive neighborhood rehabilitation, and Woodruff Place is now considered a highly desirable historic inner-city address. Its design reflects the developer's plan to build a prestigious enclave. Most of the homes in Woodruff Place are expansive, Victorian style homes from the late 19th century. The layout of the neighborhood is simple; three drives that run north-south (appropriately named East, West, and Middle) and a cross drive (not surprisingly, named Cross Drive). The streets are lined with magnolia and oak trees and have a central median. A fountain sits at each one of the intersections. Smaller fountains line the medians. Note: This includes , Site Map, and Accompanying photographs Woodruff Place was the inspiration behind Indianapolis native Booth Tarkington's successful novel The Magnificent Ambersons. Artist T. C. Steele's son Brandt, a noted designer and architect in his own right, and his family were also Woodruff Place residents, living in a home designed by Brandt Steele. James O. Woodruff also created \\"Hendricks Place.\\" In the spring of 1872, Thomas A. Hendricks was elected governor of Indiana. He sold his property to Woodruff, who then created his first Victorian neighborhood, \\"Hendricks Place\\". In the fall of that year, Woodruff created \\"Woodruff Place,\\" but few homes were built because a depression in 1873 stopped construction in both neighborhoods for almost twenty years. In 1972, Woodruff Place was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2001, the neighborhood was officially designated a local historic preservation district by the City of Indianapolis.

In 524, Northern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan, after Emperor Xiaowu had fled the capital Luoyang to reestablish the imperial government at Chang'an, made Emperor Xiaojing emperor as Emperor Xiaowu's replacement, and moved the capital from Luoyang to Yecheng, thus dividing Northern Wei into two, and Emperor Xiaojing's state became known as Eastern Wei. Although Gao Huan treated him with respect, real power was in the hands of Gao Huan, and then Gao Huan's sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang. In 550, Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). Around the new year 552, the former Emperor Xiaojing was poisoned to death on the orders of the new emperor.  Background  Yuan Shanjian was born in 524. His father Yuan Dan (ÂÖÉ‰∫∂) the Prince of Qinghe was a son of the well-regarded Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÊáå), also Prince of Qinghe and a son of Emperor Xiaowen. His mother Princess Hu was Yuan Dan's wife and was a granddaughter of Hu Zhen (ËÉ°Áúü), an uncle of Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu. Yuan Shanjian was Yuan Dan's oldest son, and was his heir apparent. In 534, Emperor Xiaowu, a cousin of Yuan Shanjian's father Yuan Dan, seeking to resist the control of the paramount general Gao Huan, entered into an alliance with independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù). When Gao, in response, marched toward the capital Luoyang, Emperor Xiaowu fled to Yuwen's territory. Yuan Dan initially joined Emperor Xiaowu on his flight, but quickly abandoned Emperor Xiaowu and returned to Luoyang. After Gao entered Luoyang, he had Yuan Dan assume acting imperial powers, and Yuan Dan began to become arrogant, viewing himself as the next emperor. Gao, who was in fact looking for a new emperor to replace Emperor Xiaowu, felt that Yuan Dan was inappropriate, and therefore, under the excuse that a cousin should not succeed another, chose Yuan Shanjian and declared him emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing). (Yuan Dan, in embarrassment and fear, tried to flee south, presumably to rival Liang Dynasty, but Gao tracked him down and brought him back to Luoyang.) This formally divided Northern Wei into Eastern Wei (with Emperor Xiaojing as emperor) and Western Wei (with Emperor Xiaowu as Emperor).  During Gao Huan's lifetime  Gao Huan, believing that Luoyang was too close to the borders of Western Wei and Liang, moved the capital to Yecheng, an important city firmly under his control. Viewing Emperor Xiaowu's flight as a blot on his person, Gao publicly showed Emperor Xiaojing the utmost respect for the rest of his life, and Gao's subordinates did not dare not to follow suit, although actual authority rested in the hands of Gao and other officials Gao delegated authority to. Gao also made repeated attempts to conquer Western Wei to reunify Northern Wei, but each time was repelled by Yuwen Tai or other Western Wei generals. Gao mostly remained at his headquarters in Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but made occasional visits to Yecheng. In 536, Gao put his son, Gao Cheng, in charge of the Eastern Wei government. Late that year, Emperor Xiaojing's father Yuan Dan died, and according to some historians (but not all), Gao assassinated him. Emperor Xiaojing, as he grew, was described to be handsome and strong, capable of jumping over a fence while holding a stone lion. He was also said to be skillful at horseriding, archery, and literature. People compared him to his famed ancestor, Emperor Xiaowen. In 539, Emperor Xiaojing took Gao Huan's second daughter as his empress. In 544, Gao Cheng, wanting to place a trusted official to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing, made his associate Cui Jishu (Â¥îÂ≠£Ëàí) Emperor Xiaojing's secretary. However, Emperor Xiaojing had a cordial relationship with Cui, who often revised submissions Gao made to Emperor Xiaojing and edicts Emperor Xiaojing issued to Gao Huan and Gao Cheng, to improve the style and content. Emperor Xiaojing frequently made the comment, \\"Cui is my wet nurse.\\" In 545, pursuant to Gao Huan's request, Emperor Xiaojing took the cousin of the khan of Tuyuhun, Murong Kual√º (ÊÖïÂÆπÂ§∏ÂëÇ), as a concubine, to try to enhance the relationship with Tuyuhun. In 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng took over full power of the government.  During Gao Cheng's regency  In light of Gao Huan's death, the general Hou Jing, who did not respect Gao Cheng, first surrendered the 13 provinces he controlled (the region between the Huai River and Yellow River) to Western Wei, and then to Liang. Gao Cheng's general Murong Shaozong (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ¥πÂÆó), however, defeated both Xiao Yuanming ‚Äì nephew of Liang's Emperor Wu, whom Emperor Wu sent to assist Hou ‚Äì and Hou, capturing Xiao Yuanming and forcing Hou to flee to Liang. By 548, all but four provinces (which Western Wei took) were back under Eastern Wei control, and by 549, Eastern Wei had recaptured those provinces as well, after Gao Cheng captured Changshe (Èï∑Á§æ, in modern Xuchang, Henan). Meanwhile, during the campaign against Hou, a conflict between Gao Cheng and Emperor Xiaojing would erupt. Gao Cheng was not as respectful to Emperor Xiaojing as Gao Huan was, and he ordered Cui Jishu to intensify his surveillance of Emperor Xiaojing. On one occasion, when Gao Cheng was attending a feast, he flashed a cup before Emperor Xiaojing as a toast ‚Äì a very disrespectful gesture, as a subordinate, when toasting the emperor, was supposed to kneel. Emperor Xiaojing became angry, and remarked, \\"There is no such thing as an everlasting empire. Zhen [(Êúï, the pronoun used by the emperor to refer to himself)] do not necessarily treasure my life!\\" Gao Cheng angrily responded, \\"Zhen, zhen, zhen! You are a zhen with dog feet!\\" He ordered Cui to punch Emperor Xiaojing three times, and then left abruptly. Emperor Xiaojing thereafter entered into a conspiracy with his teacher Xun Ji (ËçÄÊøü), Yuan Jin (ÂÖÉÁëæ), Liu Siyi (ÂäâÊÄùÈÄ∏), Yuan Daqi (ÂÖÉÂ§ßÂô®) the Prince of Huashan, Yuan Xuanhong (ÂÖÉÂÆ£Ê¥™) the Prince of Huainan, and Yuan Hui (ÂÖÉÂæΩ) the Prince of Jibei to consider overthrowing Gao Cheng. They dug a tunnel from within the palace to the outside of the city, intending to create a secret passage for imperial guards to go through, but the tunnel was discovered, and Gao Cheng entered the palace with his troops, arresting Emperor Xiaojing, putting him under house arrest, and executing the other members of the conspiracy. In spring 549, Emperor Xiaojing was forced to create Gao Cheng the greater title of Prince of Qi, and give him the honorific office of Xiangguo (Áõ∏Âúã), both signifying a move toward Gao's taking of the throne. Gao Cheng formally declined these honors, and further made a formal request for Emperor Xiaojing to create a son as crown prince. Subsequently, in fall 549, Emperor Xiaojing created his son Yuan Zhangren (ÂÖÉÈï∑‰ªÅ) crown prince. (It is not known whether Yuan Zhangren's mother was Empress Gao.) Also in fall 549, Gao Cheng was meeting Chen Yuankang (Èô≥ÂÖÉÂ∫∑), Yang Yin, and Cui Jishu, to secretly discuss the timeframe in which to take the throne, when his servant Lan Jing (Ëò≠‰∫¨) ‚Äì a son of the Liang general Lan Qin (Ëò≠Ê¨Ω) Gao Cheng captured in battle, and whom Gao Cheng had repeatedly threatened to kill ‚Äì assassinated Gao Cheng and Chen. Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang the Duke of Taiyuan, who was also in Yecheng at the time, killed Lan Jing and his associates, and publicly declared only that Gao Cheng had been wounded. Emperor Xiaojing, however, believed that Gao Cheng was dead, and secretly made the remark, \\"It is heaven's will that the Grand Marshal [(Â§ßÂ∞áËªç, D√† JiƒÅngj≈´n, Gao Cheng's title at that time)] is dead. The power to rule should return to the imperial clan.\\"  During Gao Yang's regency  Gao Yang, however, quickly moved to consolidate power. He made a quick show of force, marching his personal guards of 8,000 men into the palace, and stating to Emperor Xiaojing that he was going to Jinyang ‚Äì where the military headquarters were. Emperor Xiaojing, seeing Gao Yang's intent on keeping power, turned pale and stated, \\"This man does not appear any more tolerant of me. I do not know when I will die.\\" Gao Yang set up his headquarters in Jinyang, intending to control the military, and in spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing create him the Prince of Qi Commandery ‚Äì a slightly lesser title than the one that his brother declined before his death. Just two months later, Gao Yang's title was changed to Prince of Qi. Meanwhile, Gao Yang's associate Gao Dezheng (È´òÂæ∑Êîø) was trying to persuade him to seize the throne. In summer 550, Gao Yang agreed, and he started advancing toward Yecheng, while sending Gao Dezheng to Yecheng to try to force the issue. Emperor Xiaojing bestowed Gao Yang the nine bestowments ‚Äì the traditional penultimate step before abdication. After Gao Yang arrived in Yecheng, with the officials Pan Le (ÊΩòÊ®Ç), Zhang Liang (Âºµ‰∫Æ), and Zhao Yanshen (Ë∂ôÂΩ•Ê∑±) sent by Gao Yang to request his abdication, Emperor Xiaojing did so, yielding the throne to Gao Yang, who established Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan).  After removal from power  The new Emperor Wenxuan created the former emperor the Prince of Zhongshan, and gave him the special treatment of not having to declare himself a subject of the new emperor. He created his sister, the former empress, the Princess Taiyuan. The former emperor resided with the princess, and the princess, worried that her brother might do her husband harm, kept close watch on her husband, often tasting his food to make sure that it was not poisoned. However, Emperor Wenxuan was apprehensive of the former emperor. Around the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan invited the Princess Taiyuan to a feast inside the palace. As soon as she left her residence, Emperor Wenxuan sent assassins to force the former emperor to drink poisoned wine, and also killed his three sons. Emperor Wenxuan gave the former emperor the posthumous name of Xiaojing, and also buried him with imperial honors. However, at a later time, for reasons unknown, Emperor Wenxuan opened up the tomb and threw Emperor Xiaojing's casket into the Zhang River (Êº≥Ê∞¥).

The battle gained him much support and immediately preceded his march into Venezuela, later dubbed the Admirable Campaign. The battle The battle began at 9:00 a.m. on 28 February 1813, and finished in the early afternoon involving four hundred men under the command of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and eight hundred under Spanish General Ram√≥n Correa fought. There were two fatalities and fourteen injuries among Bol√≠var's troops, and twenty fatalities and forty injured among Correa's troops. Events Sim√≥n Bol√≠var launched an offensive against the Spanish forces along the eastern banks of the Tachira River. Bol√≠var's campaign ended in victory, enabling him to drive Royalist forces from the valleys of C√∫cuta. On 28 February 1813, the Sunday of Carnival, General Correa went to church; meanwhile Bol√≠var's forces had positioned themselves in the western hills that overlook the town of C√∫cuta. General Correa learned of this movement and set out to drive Bol√≠var's troops from their positions. A force of about 100 royalist infantry tried to overcome the right flank of Bol√≠var's army, but a fast change of position foiled the attempt. There was heavy fighting throughout the morning. The battle lasted four hours before it was decided. In the afternoon, Bol√≠var ordered a bayonet charge, which drove General Correa's men from the field. The decimated troops fled to San Antonio del T√°chira and to La Grita. Simon Bol√≠var entered C√∫cuta with his soldiers and declared victory from General Correa's captured headquarters. After the conflict Supporters of independence rejoiced and cooperated openly with Bol√≠var. Mercedes Abrego de Reyes, in order to show her support and admiration for Bol√≠var, embroidered a coat for him, which he wore during the Admirable Campaign that liberated Venezuela from the Spanish; she was later arrested by the Spanish, accused of conspiracy and executed on 13 October 1813.Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arando - Mercedes √Åbrego de Reyes According to Bolivar Bolivar's Aide-de-Camp General O'Leary published Bolivar's account of the battle in his memoirs:Daniel Florencio O'Leary Sim√≥n Bol√≠var O'Leary & Manuel P√©rez Vila (1981). Memorias del general O'Leary, publ. por S.B. O'Leary. Caracas: Ministerio de la Defensa, pp. 149 \\"After the arrival at my headquarters in San Cayetano of supplies, the rearguard and one hundred and twenty-six men from the Union under the command of Captains Usc√°tegui and Ramirez, we crossed the Zulia river yesterday afternoon and at dawn today we started out for the capital of C√∫cuta and the enemy's headquarters. Before nine in the morning we had taken possession of the heights overlooking the valley, and from the peak opened fire with rifles upon the enemy encamped outside the town. As soon as we showed ourselves a unit of 100 men tried to outflank us on our right, but in vain because our movements made them abandon their enterprise. They then changed plan and took the heights that were to our left, from whence they were dislodged violently and to their great cost. Meanwhile my center, under the command of Colonel Francisco Jos√© Ribas sustained a terrible barrage on the enemy, who defended with a blind obstinacy, yielding ground inch by inch forcing them to change their positions constantly and which they held with the bulk of their troops and all their artillery and cavalry. Seeing that our soldiers were fighting much more fervently when danger was higher, I ordered Colonel Rivas and the rest of the troops to start the attack on the town and encampment. This was carried out despite the intense artillery and rifle fire raining down on us from all sides, advancing step by step; and tired after 4 hours battle, we entered with fixed bayonets as we had almost run out of cavalry ammunition. At that moment the enemy was seized with panic-stricken horror, and fled hastily, yielding to us their positions, artillery, equipment, guns, victuals and a number of effects pertaining to the Spanish government and their accomplices. We have achieved an utterly complete victory, handing us their fortifications and these flower-covered valleys that they had enslaved, killing or wounding a multitude of soldiers and officers, including their leader Correa himself who had left the battlefield with a serious head wound, whilst we suffered such disproportionate losses that we need only lament two dead and 14 wounded, including citizen Concha, valiant Lieutenant of the Union troops. All our soldiers and officers have covered themselves with glory, but most particularly Colonel Rivas, who led all the troops from the front and to whom the country owes this day a great part of its triumph; equally outstanding were Major Narv√°rez, Captain Vidal, commander of the rearguard; Captain Lino Ramirez, commander of the troops of Pamplona; the commander of vanguard, brave citizen Pedro Guillen; Adjutant Rib√≥n; and to avoid a long list I will say in a word that every soldier to the very last one has fulfilled his duty with honor. The enemy never managed to make us back down a single step, despite his advantages in artillery and cavalry and positions within the town\\".

Built in both Austria and Canada, it was developed as a four-seat version of the earlier DA20 by Diamond Aircraft Industries. Design and development Based on the success of the earlier DV20/DA20 two-seat aircraft, the company designed a four-seat variant, the DA40 Diamond Star. The DA40 is a four-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane made from composite materials. It has a fixed tricycle landing gear and a T-tail. The Rotax 914-powered prototype DA40-V1, registered OE-VPC, first flew on 5 November 1997 and was followed by a second prototype DA40-V2 (registered OE- VPE) which was powered by a Continental IO-240. In 1998 a third prototype DA40-V3 flew powered by a Lycoming IO-360 engine. Four more test aircraft were produced followed by the first production aircraft in 2000. JAR23 certification of the IO-360 production variant was obtained in October 2000. In 2002 the production of the Lycoming-engined variant was moved to Canada and the Austrian factory concentrated on diesel-engined variants. The DA40 has officially appeared in only three versions, the DA 40, DA 40D and DA 40F, as documented on its type certificates. The various model names that the aircraft has been sold under are marketing names and are not officially recognized by the authorities that have certified the aircraft. The DA40 was initially marketed as the DA40-180, powered by a fuel injected Textron Lycoming IO-360 M1A engine. In late 2006, the XL and FP models replaced the DA40-180. The FP replaced the fixed pitch propeller version of the 180 and the XL replaced the constant speed propeller version. The major difference between the new models and the 180 is the higher maximum cruise speeds. The DA40-XL is approximately four knots faster than the preceding DA40-180/G1000 with the two-blade Hartzell propeller and the \\"Speed Gear\\" option. The XL's speed increase is mostly due to the Powerflow exhaust system. The DA40-XL has a constant speed propeller and is powered by a Lycoming IO-360-M1A fuel injected engine. It has a maximum cruise speed of 147 knots, burning 9.2 gallons of Avgas per hour. Its maximum takeoff weight is 2,535 lb (1,150 kg). The DA40-F (marketed as the \\"FP\\") has a fixed pitch propeller, a Lycoming O-360-A4M engine, which has a carburettor rather than fuel injection and a more basic interior, but is otherwise similar to the XL. The DA40-TDI uses a Thielert \\"Centurion\\" diesel engine and burns diesel or jet fuel. It has a constant speed propeller and FADEC (single lever) engine control. The first flight of the DA40D was made on 28 Nov. 2002. This model is not certified in the US. Efforts to increase the DA40's cruising speed centered on the propeller and wheel spats. The wheel fairing streamlining was improved, a three-blade scimitar-type constant speed propeller was incorporated and the Powerflow exhaust system from the XL was retained. The canopy contour was also revised, with the sides being more vertical before curving into the roof, which provides more shoulder and head room. In the last half of 2007 the company updated the DA40 line by introducing the XLS and CS versions and eliminated the FP model. The XLS is the deluxe version, with the integration of some options into the standard offering including a Powerflow tuned exhaust, WAAS-capable G1000, GDL69 datalink, and TAS traffic alert system. The CS is the budget version, with fewer standard features. Both CS and XLS versions of the DA40 use the Lycoming IO-360-M1A fuel injected engine. The major difference is the choice of propeller, with the CS using a Hartzell two-blade aluminum constant speed prop and the XLS using an MT composite three-blade unit. Pilot and passengers board the DA40 via the leading edge of the wing, an unusual feature among low-wing aircraft. The aircraft's nosewheel is free-castoring and directional control while taxiing is by mainwheel differential braking.Flying the Diamond Star XLS, Flying, Vol. 135., No. 5, May 2008, p. 64. DA40s are produced at Diamond's aircraft factories in Wiener Neustadt, Austria and in London, Ontario, Canada. A joint venture has also been set up in China with Shandong Bin Ao Aircraft Industries for production of the DA40 TDI (Diesel) in Shandong Province. Capacity is available for up to 1,000 aircraft a year to be produced with certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2008.\\"News Breaks\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 1 January 2007. A Chinese flying school has used its CD-135 for 13 hours per day on average. Past DA40 models were available with either traditional mechanical instruments or an optional Garmin G1000 glass cockpit suite. Current production DA40s are built only with the Garmin G1000 as standard equipment. In April 2008, Diamond introduced the optional availability of Garmin Synthetic Vision Technology on the DA40 XLS. Operational history The DA40 has accumulated a very low accident record, particularly with regard to stall and spin accidents. Its overall and fatal accident rates are one-eighth that of the general aviation fleet and include no stall-related accidents. The level of safe operation is attributed to its high aspect ratio wing, low wing loading and benign flight characteristics. The aircraft can be trimmed full nose up, engine set to idle and it will descend at 600‚Äì1200 feet per minute at hands-off, a lower rate of descent than the competitor Cirrus SR22 can achieve with its airframe ballistic parachute deployed. In a 2011 analysis by Aviation Consumer magazine, the DA40 was shown to have had a fatal accident rate of 0.35/100,000 hours, the lowest in US general aviation and considerably better than the market leading Cirrus SR20 and SR22, which that year had a combined fatal accident rate of 1.6/100,000, despite its full aircraft parachute system. By comparison, the Cessna 172 had a fatal accident rate of 0.45/100,000 hours.

History ;Dookie Football Club - 1887 to 1976 The original Dookie Football Club was established in 1887. In one of Dookie‚Äôs earliest recorded matches in 1891, Dookie: 6.20 - 56 defeated Katamatite: 0.0 - 0 at Dookie. In July, 1903, The Dookie FC was reformed with office bearers and a committee elected. The club colors selected were - navy blue and white, with a red sash, with blue and white socks. In 1906, the Dookie Football Association was formed, with Dookie finishing on top of the ladder and winning the premiership. In 1912, Dookie FC won two premierships, defeating Caniambo in the Dookie FA and in the Katandra Wenesday FA, defeating Katandra. In 1912 & 1913 there was a Dookie Wednesday Football Club, that use to play on the Wednesday afternoon half holiday.

Early years Elman was born in Philadelphia, but his family settled in Atlantic City, New Jersey when he was four. His father was a violinist who had hoped Elman would play violin. Although he did learn to play violin, he preferred brass instruments. He began playing for Jewish weddings and nightclubs at age 15. Career In 1932 made his first recording, playing the trombone. At some point in the decade he adopted the name \\"Ziggy Elman\\". Elman is a shortening of Finkelman. In 1936 Elman joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as a trumpeter after playing briefly with a band led by Alex Bartha at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, where Goodman heard him. In 1938, while with Goodman, he got a contract with Bluebird, RCA's cheaper label, to record 20 sides as Ziggy Elman and his Orchestra, although all the members were in Goodman's band. One original tune was \\"Frailach in Swing,\\" based on a 1918 recording of \\"Der Shtiller Bulgar\\" (\\"The Quiet Bulgar\\") by Abe Schwartz. During the first half of 1939, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra was featured on the \\"Camel Caravan\\" radio show, with singer and songwriter Johnny Mercer as singer, writer of speciality numbers, and announcer. One weekly show, Goodman challenged Mercer, who was known for usually being a fast writer, to write lyrics for Elman's tune in one week. Two weeks later, Mercer brought some lyrics for a slower tempo. Goodman had arranger Jimmy Mundy write an arrangement for the tune, now called \\"And the Angels Sing\\". The recording, with vocal by Martha Tilton and featuring Elmam's trumpet, was a #1 hit. Mercer biographer Philip Furia suggests the challenge to Mercer \\"sounds like a prearranged plug for a completed song.\\"\\"Ziggy Elman:‚ÄôFrailach In Swing'\\" Big Band Library, http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/ziggyelman.html accessed 8/25/2019Philip Furia, Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer\\", St. Martin's Press, New York, 2003, pp.109-110. After leaving Goodman in 1940, Elman joined Tommy Dorsey and stayed until he was drafted in 1943. After he was discharged in 1946, he rejoined Dorsey for another year.Big Band Library He loved frailach music (Jewish wedding music) later known as klezmer, and made a few recordings of such with Mickey Katz. In the period from 1940 to 1947 he was honored in Down Beat magazine's Readers Poll six times. He led his own bands from 1947. In 1956 he was asked to recreate a klezmer solo with the vocalist Martha Tilton for the movie, The Benny Goodman Story, but was unable to, his technique having since withered away. Elman appeared performing it in the film, but another trumpeter, Mannie Klein, played the solo on the soundtrack.The Rough Guide to Jazz By the 1950s, the music had changed. Big bands had declined and for a time he switched to entertainment work. In this decade he appeared in films mostly as himself. In 1956 he had a heart attack, curtailing his music career. By the end of the 1950s he was financially ruined and had to work for a car dealership. In 1961 it was revealed at an alimony hearing that he was virtually bankrupt. He later worked in a music store and gave trumpet lessons. He died in 1968 at 54 and was buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

It has 3,061 inhabitants (2019). History Former Oflag II-C German POW camp, now a museum The area formed part of Greater Poland in Piast-ruled Poland. The settlement was mentioned in 1250, when Duke Przemys≈Ç I of Greater Poland granted it to Cistercians from Owi≈Ñska.Krzysztof Niedzia≈Çkowski, ≈ölad Woldenberczyk√≥w w ≈ºyciu Dobiegniewa po 1945 roku (in Polish) In 1280 it was mentioned under the latinized name villa Dobegneve in a document of Przemys≈Ç II of Poland. Kodeks dyplomatyczny Wielkopolski, tom I, Biblioteka K√≥rnicka, Pozna≈Ñ, 1877, p. 465-466. It was granted town rights in 1298. In 1333 the town's name is mentioned as ‚ÄûWaldinborg‚Äú. In 1373, along with the region it became part of the Czech Crown Lands, ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Krak√≥w, according to which Poland was to purchase and re-incorporate the region,Leon Rogalski, Dzieje Krzy≈ºak√≥w oraz ich stosunki z PolskƒÖ, LitwƒÖ i Prussami, poprzedzone rysem dziej√≥w wojen krzy≈ºowych, Vol. II, Warszawa, 1846, p. 59-60 (in Polish) but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order. It was captured by joint Polish-Czech forces in 1433, during the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1431‚Äì1435). When another Polish-Teutonic war broke out in 1454, the Teutonic Knights sold the region to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war. The prosperity of the town came from agriculture, clothmaking and trade. It was located on the trade route connecting Pozna≈Ñ and Szczecin, and despite its annexation from Poland, it still had strong ties with Greater Poland. After the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) many Poles settled in the town, and until 1660 local merchants were exempt from tariffs in trade with Poland. From the 18th century it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and from 1871 also Germany, until 1945. During World War II, the Oflag II-C German POW camp was located nearby (today within the city limits). The camp housed Polish officers. Today it houses the Muzeum Woldenberczyk√≥w, which is dedicated to the history of the prisoners. The Germans also established a prison for foreigners, mostly Poles, accused of wanting to escape from forced labor. In the final stages of World War II, the town was heavily destroyed and finally captured in January 1945. Subsequently the town became again part of Poland and its historic name Dobiegniew was restored. Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities See twin towns of Gmina Dobiegniew.

The role did not last very long as he left the show and the season wrapped in under a year. Combs died on June 2, 1996 by hanging himself in a Glendale psychiatric ward. The second season, rechristened The New Family Challenge, was hosted by Michael Burger and announced by Charlie Glaize. The show was created by comedian Dave Thomas and Woody Fraser and was originally produced as a pilot for ABC. Thomas and Fraser were executive producers on the show for its entire run on Family Channel. Premise Two teams of six family members competed. Each team usually consisted of two adults and four children (commonly the parents' own children, plus nieces and/or nephews). Usually six stunts were played, and each stunt was worth a varying number of points. The stunts varied in each show; the following are a few stunts used on the show during the first season. Stunts * Tug of war: All six members of the first team competed against American Gladiator Hawk, with a tank full of green \\"gunk\\" set up at the center point. The team won one point for each second they could stay up. They won 60 points if they stayed up for 30 seconds or pulled Hawk into the gunk. This process would be repeated for the second team. * Backwards relay race: Three members of each team competed. The first team started at a table with various items on it. The first teammate ran backwards to a board and read a short message written backwards on it, which corresponded to an item on the table. He then ran backwards to the starting position and do something with the item. (For example, \\"This Icy Sensation Causes A Gyration\\" means they must pour a pitcher of water down their pants, and \\"Simple Simon Met A Pie Man\\" means they must smosh a pie into their face.) This continued until all three teammates had a chance to do two things. After the first family finished, the second family was brought out of isolation to try to beat their time. The family who could do it in the fastest time won 100 points. * Kissing contest: One event involved three doors and one member of each team. The player on the first team would pick a door, behind which was a live animal, which the contestant would have to kiss on the lips. If the player kept contact with it for 5 seconds, that family won 10 points. The player on the second team then picked a second door, and had to kiss whatever was behind it. After this, each player could elect to kiss whatever was behind the unpicked door, but had to do it blindfolded for 10 seconds. Doing this won 20 points. * Pearl diving: Two members of each team had two minutes to wade in a giant tank of gunk looking for large balls that represented pearls. Each white \\"pearl\\" collected won 10 points, and each black \\"pearl\\" won 50. * Family Quiz: In a manner similar to The Newlywed Game, one family member from each team is asked questions about one of their teammates (e.g. parents answering questions about one of their kids). Each correct answer is worth 10 points, while each incorrect answer results in a messy penalty for the player answering the questions, like a pie in the face. * Pie Device Relay: Teams played individually. One family member had to run around to several pie devices where their teammates were placed. First, the runner must run to the Pie Pendulum, where they must lower the 1st family member into a large pie. Next, they run to the Pie Roulette to launch a pie at the next teammate, usually the father. Then, they run to the Pie Guillotine to drop a pie on the next teammate, then launch another pie from the Pie Roulette. Afterward, they must pop a gunk balloon above their next teammate, usually the mother, then it's back to the Pie Roulette to launch another pie. Next, they run to the Pie Cannon to launch whipped cream at the next teammate, returning to the Pie Roulette for one last pie. Afterward, the runner must go up the stairs and down the slide into the Gunk Tank. The runner then must wade through the Gunk Tank, where they must put one last pie in their face to stop the clock. Fastest time won. Both the Pie Pendulum and Pie Roulette were previously used on the Nickelodeon game show What Would You Do?, which was also created by Woody Fraser. At the end of the final event, the team with the most points was the winner. That team won two prizes (such as a new living room group and a ceiling fan), and a trophy called \\"The Family Challenge Championship Cup\\". Season two changes Besides the new host and announcer, the show was re- titled The New Family Challenge and given a new set. It was taped at Universal Studios Hollywood. The game was played the same as before, except that only four stunts were played. Burger also played games with the audience, filling the time previously used for the fifth and sixth stunt. Each team this season had 5 players, usually 2 adults and 3 children, and the team colors changed every episode whereas in season 1 it was always red team versus blue team. Towards the end of the run, all Friday shows consisted solely of audience participation games. The second-season premiere was dedicated to the memory of Ray Combs, as acknowledged during the credits.

This refrigerator is extremely simple and does not require power, making it suitable for use in desert environments without easy access to electricity or repairs. It consists of a small earthenware pot placed inside a larger one, and the space between the two filled with moist sand. The inner pot is filled with whatever is desired to be cooled (fruit, vegetables, drinks) and covered with a wet cloth. The evaporating water draws heat from the inside through the porous outer pot, cooling the interior. Abba hails from a family of potmakers and tapped into the large underemployed local workforce for the project. Local pot-makers he hired produced the first batch of 5,000 pot-in-pot refrigerators. He received the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2001 and used his $75,000 award to make the invention available throughout Nigeria. Abba devised an educational campaign tailored to village life and the illiterate population featuring a video- recorded play by local actors to dramatise the benefits of the desert refrigerator. The pots sell at 40 US cents a pair.

He played on the memorable \\"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook\\" album (1963) under the baton of the great Nelson Riddle. Despite high demand for his services as a lyrical soloist, he only recorded twice as a leader: a half-date for Capitol in 1955 (reissued as part of the Dave Pell Octet CD I Had the Craziest Dream) and a complete project for Mode in 1957 (Music to Fill a Void). In 1956, Fagerquist signed on as a staff musician for Paramount Films, while still periodically recording with artists such as Shelly Manne, Mel Torm√©, and Art Pepper. Throughout the early- to mid-1960s, Fagerquist's solos could be heard on the recordings of Pete Rugolo, Frank Comstock, Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Paul Weston, Si Zentner, Dean Martin and many others. By 1966, health issues forced Fagerquist to withdraw from studio recording altogether. He died from kidney disease at his home in Canoga Park, California, at the age of 46.

It is affiliated to West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE). The school's motto is '‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§Æ‡§Ø' (Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya), which in Sanskrit means Lead us from darkness unto Light. It provides education from standards Kindergarten to Class 6 in the primary section and Classes 07 to 10 in the secondary section. The school leaving examination is called Madhyamik, which is held at the end of class X by WBBSE.  History  In 1938, some members of the Andhra Association (Kolkata Branch) felt their children should be taught Telugu, their mother tongue. At that time no school in Kolkata (then Calcutta) had Telugu language in its curriculum. A small number of children were taught Telugu by a few ladies of the Telugu society. This unofficial and free school went on for some years, but not regularly. As time went on people wanted a regular school. On 28 March 1953, a primary school was founded with three classes. Andhra Association School became broad based, where not only Telugu but other languages and subjects were taught too. The school was recognized as a junior high school in 1958. By 1960, the junior high school rose to be a high school. The first president was Sri Venkatesam and the first headmistress was Mrs. P. Kamalam. West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) recognized it as an unaided high school in 1965. Initially the school operated in two locations - the primary section (nursery to class 4) from rented premises at 5, Satyen Datta Road near Desapriya Park and the secondary section (class 5 to class 10) from Hindustan Park near Gariahat. The Association operated from the primary school premises. The school's current premises at Sahanagar had an indoor auditorium owned by the association. This was used for activities of the school and the association, and was rented out on request. The current school building was constructed in the open area near the auditorium within the premises, and both sections of the schools shifted to this location. After the move to the new location, the school added classes 11 and 12. Famous Personality as studied here Maytr Major Sayamsundar. He studied in the institution for 10 years from class 01 to 10.  Instruction medium and subjects  Andhra Association School provides education in the medium of English. Students choose a compulsory first language from Hindi, Telugu. (Although the school has been offering Tamil as one of the options for first language for many years, the school's website does not list Tamil as an option.) English is the compulsory second language. Students in the secondary school also study a third language: Bengali or Hindi. The medium of instruction is English for all other subjects like mathematics, life science, physical science, history, geography, computers, etc. The school follows its own curriculum and subject combinations from kindergarten to standard VIII. Subject combinations and curriculum of classes IX and X are governed by the WBBSE to allow the school to meet statewide education standards.

She was the second daughter of the paramount general Gao Huan, who, after a formal break with Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei in 534, made Xiaojing, then age 10, emperor, thus dividing Northern Wei into Eastern Wei and Western Wei. In 539, Gao Huan married her to Emperor Xiaojing. It is not known whether Emperor Xiaojing's only son known by name, Yuan Zhangren (ÂÖÉÈï∑‰ªÅ), who was created crown prince in 549, was her son or not. (He had two other sons whose names are lost to history.) In 550, Empress Gao's brother Gao Yang, who had by that point succeeded Gao Huan and another son of Gao Huan's, Gao Cheng, forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan, and created the former Empress Gao the Princess Taiyuan, and she therefore carried double titles. Fearful that her brother, who was known for his violent nature, would harm her husband, she took her husband wherever she went, and she also tasted all of his food to make sure that it was not poisoned. Despite her precautions, however, she could not prevent his death, as around the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan invited her to the palace for a feast, and then, as she was attending the feast, he sent assassins to force the Prince of Zhongshan and his three sons to drink poisoned wine. Later in 552, Emperor Wenxuan married the Princess Taiyuan to one of his officials, Yang Yin. That was the last reference to her in history, and it is not known whether she survived to 560, when Yang was killed by another brother of hers, Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan in a power struggle.

Her stage debut, in her native city, came in 1821, when she performed in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, a performance for which Franz Schubert had briefly served as her r√©p√©titeur. Three years later she sang in the first performances of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Missa Solemnis. She performed a great deal in Italy, principally in Naples after 1825 when she became engaged to the impresario of the Teatro San Carlo, Domenico Barbaia. Among the roles written for her were those of Isoletta in Vincenzo Bellini's La straniera (1829, Milan), Gaetano Donizetti's Parisina (1833, Florence), Antonina in Belisario (1836, Venice), Maria de Rudenz (1838, Venice), and Bianca in Saverio Mercadante's Le due illustre rivali (1838, Venice).

Heuristic analysis is an expert based analysis that determines the susceptibility of a system towards particular threat/risk using various decision rules or weighing methods. MultiCriteria analysis (MCA) is one of the means of weighing. This method differs from statistical analysis, which bases itself on the available data/statistics. Operation Most antivirus programs that utilize heuristic analysis perform this function by executing the programming commands of a questionable program or script within a specialized virtual machine, thereby allowing the anti-virus program to internally simulate what would happen if the suspicious file were to be executed while keeping the suspicious code isolated from the real-world machine. It then analyzes the commands as they are performed, monitoring for common viral activities such as replication, file overwrites, and attempts to hide the existence of the suspicious file. If one or more virus-like actions are detected, the suspicious file is flagged as a potential virus, and the user alerted. Another common method of heuristic analysis is for the anti-virus program to decompile the suspicious program, then analyze the machine code contained within. The source code of the suspicious file is compared to the source code of known viruses and virus-like activities. If a certain percentage of the source code matches with the code of known viruses or virus-like activities, the file is flagged, and the user alerted. Effectiveness Heuristic analysis is capable of detecting many previously unknown viruses and new variants of current viruses. However, heuristic analysis operates on the basis of experience (by comparing the suspicious file to the code and functions of known viruses). This means it is likely to miss new viruses that contain previously unknown methods of operation not found in any known viruses. Hence, the effectiveness is fairly low regarding accuracy and the number of false positives. As new viruses are discovered by human researchers, information about them is added to the heuristic analysis engine, thereby providing the engine the means to detect new viruses. What is Heuristic Analysis? Heuristic analysis is a method of detecting viruses by examining code for suspicious properties. Traditional methods of virus detection involve identifying malware by comparing code in a program to the code of known virus types that have already been encountered, analyzed and recorded in a database ‚Äì known as signature detection. While useful and still in use, signature detection method has also become more limited, due to the development of new threats which exploded around the turn of the century and are continuing to emerge all the time. To counter this problem, the heuristic model was specifically designed to spot suspicious characteristics that can be found in unknown, new viruses and modified versions of existing threats as well as known malware samples. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new threats, and heuristic analysis is one of the only methods used to deal with the huge volume of these new threats seen daily. Heuristic analysis is also one of the few methods capable of combating polymorphic viruses ‚Äî the term for malicious code that constantly changes and adapts. How Does Heuristic Analysis Work? Heuristic analysis can employ a number of different techniques. One heuristic method, known as static heuristic analysis, involves de-compiling a suspect program and examining its source code. This code is then compared to viruses that are already known and are in the heuristic database. If a particular percentage of the source code matches anything in the heuristic database, the code is flagged as a possible threat. Another method is known as dynamic heuristics. When scientists want to analyze something suspicious without endangering people, they contain the substance in a controlled environment like a secure lab and conduct tests. The process is similar for heuristic analysis ‚Äî but in a virtual world. It isolates the suspicious program or piece of code inside a specialized virtual machine ‚Äî or sandbox ‚Äî and gives the antivirus program a chance to test the code and simulate what would happen if the suspicious file was allowed to run. It examines each command as it's activated and looks for any suspicious behaviors, such as self-replication, overwriting files, and other actions that are common to viruses. Potential Issues are reported to the user. Heuristic analysis is ideal for identifying new threats, but to be effective heuristics must be carefully tuned to provide the best possible detection of new threats but without generating false positives on perfectly innocent code. For this reason, heuristic tools are often typically just one weapon in a sophisticated antivirus arsenal. They are typically deployed along with other methods of virus detection, such as signature analysis and other proactive technologies.

These territories include the Spratly Islands, Sabah, Scarborough Shoal, Palmias (Miangas), Orchid Island, the Sangir Islands, the Marianas Islands, and the Caroline Islands. Main territories claimed Spratly Islands The Philippines claims fifty-two landforms in the Spratly Island group. Of these fifty-two landforms, only five islands, two cays, and three reefs are under Philippine occupation: the Flat Island (Patag), the Loaita Island (Kota), the Nanshan Island (Lawak), the Thitu Island (Pagasa), the West York Island (Likas), the Lankiam Cay (Panata), the Northeast Cay (Parola), the Irving Reef (Balagtas), the Commodore Reef (Rizal), and the Second Thomas (Ayungin) Reef. Some of the other landforms claimed but not occupied by the Philippines as of now are either occupied by Vietnam, China, Taiwan or Malaysia. Landforms in the Spratly Islands group that have not been claimed by the Philippines are typically those that are closer to Vietnam. The farthest landform the Philippines claims is Ladd Reef, which is currently occupied by Vietnam. The Philippines established a municipality in the province of Palawan named Kalayaan after all the landforms found on Pag-asa island, North Borneo (Left) The first concession treaty was signed by Sultan Abdul Momin of Brunei on 29 December 1877, appointing Baron de Overbeck as the Maharaja Sabah, Rajah Gaya and Sandakan. (Right) The second concession treaty was signed by Sultan Jamal ul-Azam of Sulu on 22 January 1878, also appointing Baron de Overbeck as Dato Bendahara and Raja Sandakan, approximately three weeks after signature of the first treaty. The Philippine government considers concession as \\"lease\\". ICJ on 25 June 2001 Between 1658 and 1700, the Sultanate of Sulu acquired the eastern part of the territory of Northern Borneo after helping the Bruneian forces settle a civil war. The Sulu Archipelago then came under the control of the Spanish while the area of Northern Borneo was administered by the British after the sultans of Brunei and Sulu agreed to cede their control. The western and eastern parts of Northern Borneo became known as North Borneo. In its process of decolonization beginning in 1946, Great Britain included Sabah in the newly formed Federation of Malaysia. The Philippines, which had already achieved its independence from the United States, protested the formation of Malaysia and filed claims for the whole territory of Northern Borneo under the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal. However, during a meeting to plan Maphilindo, the Philippine government stated that it had no objection to the formation of Malaysia, but claimed that the Sultan of Sulu wanted payment from the British government. The first Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, said he would return to Kuala Lumpur to protest the Philippines' claim. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos later revived the claim and trained a number of Moro fighters to reclaim the territory in a secret mission named Operation Merdeka. However, when the recruits gained knowledge of their true mission, most of them demanded to be returned home, as they did not want to kill their fellow Muslims in Sabah. Their request was denied; Marcos did not send back his soldiers but instead executed most of the fighters in an event known as the Jabidah massacre. This caused a southern Philippines insurgency to emerge, and the claim continued to be escalated by other claimants from the defunct Sultanate of Sulu. These claimants each attempted to give themselves legitimacy by self-proclaiming as the new Sultan of Sulu with support from politicians in the Philippine central government wishing to incorporate Sabah into the Philippines. Most new claimants and Philippine politicians today use the promised Malaysian lease payment as their main reason to take over the territory and also use it as a reason before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Scarborough Shoal The Scarborough Shoal, more correctly described as a group of islands, atolls, and reefs rather than a shoal, is located in the South China Sea. The nearest landmass is Palauig town, Zambales province, Luzon Island, at . It is about west of Subic Bay. The Philippines and the People's Republic of China and Taiwan claim it. In April 2012, the Philippines accused Chinese boats of fishing illegally and asked them to leave. The Philippines is asserting jurisdiction over the shoal based on the juridical criteria established by public international law on the lawful methods for the acquisition of sovereignty. Among the criteria (effective occupation, cession, prescription, conquest, and accretion), the Philippines said that the country \\"exercised both effective occupation and effective jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc since its independence\\". Thus, it claims to have erected flags on some islands and a lighthouse which is reported to the International Maritime Organization. It also asserts that Philippine and US Naval Forces have used it as an impact range and that its Department of Environment and Natural Resources has conducted scientific, topographic and marine studies on the shoal, while Filipino fishermen regularly use it as a fishing ground and have always considered it their own. Likewise, multiple engagements and arrests of Chinese fishermen were already made at the shoal by the Philippine Navy for using illegal fishing methods and catching of endangered sea species. The legal basis of the Philippine's assertion is based on the international law on acquisition of sovereignty. Thus, the Philippine government explains that its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claim on the waters around Scarborough Shoal is different from the sovereignty exercised by the Philippines on the shoal itself. The Chinese basis for the claim is that the shoal would have been first discovered by Chinese in the 13th century and historically used by Chinese fishermen. Palmas or Miangas Island The Island of Palmas (or Miangas) was involved in a territorial dispute between the Netherlands and the United States which was heard by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. This case is one of the most highly influential precedents dealing with island territorial conflicts. Palmas, also referred to as Miangas, is an island of little economic value or strategic location. It is two miles in length, three-quarters of a mile in width, and had a population of about 750 when the decision of the arbitrator was handed down. The island is located between Mindanao, Philippines; and the northernmost island, known as Nanusa, of what was the former Netherlands East Indies. In 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States and Palmas sat within the boundaries of that cession to the U.S. In 1906, the United States discovered that the Netherlands also claimed sovereignty over the island and the two parties agreed to submit to binding arbitration to resolve the dispute on January 23, 1925. The arbitrator in the case was Max Huber, a Swiss national. The question the arbitrator was to resolve was whether the Island of Palmas (Miangas), in its entirety, was a part of the territory of the United States or the Netherlands. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the Netherlands' position and stated that the Netherlands held the actual title to Palmas. In the first of the United States' two arguments, it claimed to hold the island because it had received the actual title through legitimate treaties from the original \\"discoverer\\" of the island, Spain. The United States argued that Spain acquired the title to Palmas when she discovered the island and that the island was terra nullius. Spain's title to the island, because it was part of the Philippines, was then ceded to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris (1898) after Spain's defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The arbitrator noted that no new international law invalidated the legal transfer of territory via cession. However, the arbitrator noted that Spain could not legally grant what it did not hold and that the Treaty of Paris could not grant Palmas to the United States if Spain had no actual title to it. The arbitrator concluded that Spain held an inchoate title when Spain \\"discovered\\" Palmas. However, for a sovereign to maintain its initial title via discovery, the arbitrator said that the discoverer had to actually exercise authority, even if it was a simple act such as planting a flag on the beach. In this case, Spain did not exercise authority over the island after making an initial claim after discovery, so the United States' claim was based on relatively weak grounds. The United States also argued that Palmas was United States' territory because the island was closer to the Philippines than to Indonesia, which was then held by the Netherlands East Indies. The arbitrator said there was no positive international law which favored the United States' approach of terra firma, where the nearest continent or island of considerable size gives title to the land in dispute. The arbitrator held that mere proximity was not an adequate claim to land, noting that if the international community followed the proposed United States approach, it would lead to arbitrary results. The Netherlands' primary contention was that it held actual title because she had exercised authority on the island since 1677. The arbitrator noted that the United States had failed to show documentation proving Spanish sovereignty on the island except those documents that specifically mentioned the island's discovery. Additionally, there was no evidence that Palmas was a part of the judicial or administrative organization of the Spanish government of the Philippines. However, the Netherlands showed that the East India Company had negotiated treaties with the local princes of the island since the 17th century and had exercised sovereignty, including a requirement of Protestantism and the denial of other nationals on the island. The arbitrator pointed out that if Spain had actually exercised authority, then there would have been conflicts between the two countries but none were provided in the evidence. Impact and legacy Under the Palmas decision, three important rules for resolving island territorial disputes were decided: Firstly, a title based on contiguity has no standing in international law. Secondly, a title by discovery is inchoate. Finally, if another sovereign begins to exercise continuous and actual sovereignty, and the arbitrator required that the claim had to be open and public and with good title, and the discoverer does not contest this claim, the claim by the sovereign that exercises authority is greater than a title based on mere discovery. However, to this day, several Philippine legislators claim that the island cannot be part of Indonesia today because the ethnic group living in this island is far more related by language to the Sarangani people of Mindanao than any ethnic group in Indonesia (e.g., Minahasa). However this is not entirely true, since languages spoken in Miangas such as Sangir and Talaud are also spoken in the North Sulawesi province by a significant number of people. Currently, the Philippine government has no desire to contest the sovereignty of the Indonesian Government over Miangas Island and respects the Indonesian administration over the island.

While the lyrics were in French, it did contain several English words or words that could be easily understood by both an anglophone and a francophone audience: \\"bye bye\\", \\"cowboy\\", \\"gigolo\\", \\"rodeo\\". The song's theme concerns a woman ending her relationship with her \\"cowboy\\" even though he makes love like a god when she wants it. (\\"Tu fais l'amour comme un dieu et tu le fais quand je le veux\\".) She gets hot when he approaches her but she can tell by his look there are other women in his life. (\\"Quand tu m'approches je deviens chaude mais! /Ton regard il y'en a d'autres o-o\\".) This makes her angry and she tells him she is tired of playing games‚Äîit's better to leave now than never . (\\"Rien ne va plus les jeux sont faits c'est le temps d'mettre un arr√™t / C'est difficile de te quitter mais vaut mieux maintenant que jamais √©-√©.\\") The singer ends the song with the refrain: \\"Bye bye mon cowboy, bye bye mon rod√©o / C'est si dur de tomber si bas quand t'as √©t√© si haut.\\" (\\"Bye bye my cowboy, bye bye my rodeo / It's hard to fall so low when you've been so high\\".) Remixes The song was later given a house music remix by Shep Pettibone and re-released in 1989 and for the US market in 1990 with a new video. The new video featured higher production values and included shots of Mitsou, dressed in a tight black dress, running about a city with shopping bags. These scenes were interspersed with scenes shot on a studio set made to look like a barn. Several muscular cowboys danced about her as she sang the song. The song was subsequently re- recorded and remixed in 2002 for her club-oriented EP Vibe. It was released again as a single and received airplay in Qu√©bec. Follow-up Mitsou followed up the cowboy and western theme with the country-tinged ballad \\"Lettre √† un cowboy\\" (1991) (on which she sings to a cowboy \\"je t'ai dit bye bye\\", which translates as \\"I said bye bye to you\\") as well as the EP and title track Heading West (1992).

The film's soundtrack includes the George and Ira Gershwin song from which the film takes its title, here sung by Sting, and Vangelis' \\"Memories of Green\\", originally from Scott's Blade Runner. Plot Socialite Claire Gregory (Mimi Rogers) attends a party and art show sponsored by one of her oldest friends, Winn Hockings (Mark Moses). Accompanying her is her straitlaced boyfriend, Neil Steinhart (John Rubinstein). In another part of town, there is another party, this one for newly appointed NYPD detective Mike Keegan (Tom Berenger). Winn is accosted by a former partner, Joey Venza (Andreas Katsulas), who is angry because Winn had not come to him to borrow money for his new art studio. After a short argument, he stabs Winn to death. Claire witnesses the killing as she steps out of the elevator; she screams and is spotted by Venza. He pursues her, but she manages to get back into the elevator just in time. The police are called in and the new detective Keegan is there. He is a married man, but immediately falls for Claire. Along with fellow cops, he is assigned to protect Claire until she can make a positive ID of Venza (once he is arrested) and testify in court. Keegan is determined to protect Claire and goes to extremes to do so. Venza makes numerous threats and attempts on her life, nearly succeeding at one point. Keegan and his wife Ellie (Lorraine Bracco) separate over his involvement in the case. He and Claire acknowledge their love but Keegan cannot bring himself to simply abandon his family. At the end, Venza, who draws out Keegan by taking his son hostage, is shot by Ellie and killed. Claire breaks up with her staid boyfriend and intends to go to Europe to get over Keegan, who returns to his wife and son. Cast Production The film was initially pitched to Scott in 1982 during a dinner party by Howard Franklin. It was primarily written by Franklin by late 1982 with Scott years later bringing in Danilo Bach and David Seltzer to refine it. Ridley Scott made the film following Legend which had been a notable box office failure.

Critical response As of March 2020, Someone to Watch Over Me holds a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews with the consensus stating: \\"Its plot is sometimes hard to swallow, but some fine acting and director Ridley Scott's stylish visual flair make Someone to Watch Over Me an engaging police thriller\\". Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, \\"There is something fundamentally wrong with a script in which the hero sleeps with the wrong woman. I am not talking here in moral terms, but in story terms. The makers of this film got so carried away by their High Concept that they missed the point of the whole story.\\" He did, however, praise Lorraine Bracco for playing her role \\"with great force and imagination.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"Nothing that happens to these three characters is moving or even exciting. To keep the movie going until its absurd ending, the character of the murderer is changed, midstream, from an ordinary, run-of-the-mill New York mobster into a crazed psychotic.

H. Scott. The opera was first performed under the title The Two Poets at the Royal Academy of Music in London in July 1886. Background The opera, Edward German's first, was written while he was trying out various forms of composition during his continued studies of composition at the Royal Academy while a sub-professor. German called it an \\"opera de salon\\". It was written for just six soloists and two-piano accompaniment, over a three-year period, most of the writing taking place during holiday times. The opera is set in \\"an imaginary Anglo-Swiss republic,\\" and the plot has been described as being similar to Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience. The first act was premi√®red at the end of the Spring 1886 semester at the Academy, followed by a full performance that July, and another in St. George's Hall, Langham Place, near the end of the year. The piece was then toured by Academy students that Fall. Presumably due to the success of The Emerald Isle, the first opera to which German contributed since The Two Poets, German revised and expanded The Two Poets, and the opera was revived as The Rival Poets, or the Love Charm at St. George's Hall in 1901, at which time it was published by Boosey & Co. under its new title. In June 1928, the year of German's knighthood, the BBC produced a concert performance for their programming. For this version, German also wrote the narration for the announcer. Scott, the librettist, was a lifelong friend of German's, later writing the first full-length biography of the composer in 1932.

In general, bebop scales consist of traditional scales with an added passing tone placed such that when the scale is begun on a chord tone and on the downbeat, all other chord tones will also fall on downbeats, with the remaining tones in the scale occurring on the upbeat (given that the scale is played ascending or descending; i.e., no intervallic skips are played). As such, many heptatonic scales may be modified by the addition of an eighth passing tone to accomplish this same effect; however, the modifier \\"bebop\\" is reserved to indicate those scales most frequently used‚Äîand popularized‚Äîduring the bebop era (and/or by modern practitioners of the bebop genre).  Bebop dominant scale  The bebop dominant scale is derived from the Mixolydian mode and has a chromatic passing tone between the 7th and the root. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Bebop dominant scale on C } d e f g a bes b! c } } It has all the notes in both the major scale and the Mixolydian scale of the same root. This scale is often used over dominant seventh chords and all extended dominant chords,Miller, Michael (2004). Complete Idiot's Guide to Solos and Improvisation, p.96. . and over II-V chord progressions. According to Michael Miller, \\"[w]hen someone says they're playing 'the bebop scale,' this is the one they're talking about.\\"  Bebop Dorian scale  The bebop Dorian scale (also known as the bebop minor scalehttp://online-musical- scales.com/index.php/bebop-minor- scaleshttp://pianoencyclopedia.com/scales/bebop-minor/C-bebop-minor.html) is derived from the Dorian mode and has a chromatic passing tone between the minor 3rd and the perfect 4th. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Bebop Dorian scale on C } d es e f g a bes c } } It has all the notes in both the Dorian scale and the Mixolydian scale of the same root. It is the 5th mode of the bebop dominant scale. A second form of the bebop Dorian scale features a major seventh bebop note between the dominant seventh and the tonic. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Alternate bebop Dorian scale on C } d es f g a bes b c } } The second style, featuring the major seventh, is generally used by guitar players for its accessibility when applied to traditional minor scale shapes (that is, it is simply easier for guitarists to play). However, many players and resources adhere to the traditional spelling of the scale.  Bebop major scale  The bebop major scale is derived from the Ionian mode (major scale) and has a chromatic passing tone between the 5th and 6th notes. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Bebop major scale on C } d e f g gis a b c } } This scale is often used over major sixth chords and major seventh chords.  Bebop melodic minor scale  The bebop melodic minor scale is derived from the ascending form of the melodic minor scale (jazz minor scale) and has a chromatic passing tone between the 5th and 6th notes. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Bebop melodic minor scale on C } d es f g gis a b c } } It has all the notes of both the ascending form of the melodic minor scale and the harmonic minor scale of the same root. This scale is often used over minor sixth chords. These scales are listed in David N. Baker's books on bebop. They are also included, with the exception of the Dorian bebop scale, in Roni Ben-Hur's book Talk Jazz: A Comprehensive Collection of Bebop Studies, which is derived from the work of Barry Harris. Ben-Hur further elaborates on the concept of placing additional chromatic passing tones between other notes in the scales.  Bebop harmonic minor scale  The bebop harmonic minor scale (or bebop natural minor scale, as listed in Mark Levine's The Drop 2 Book) is derived from the harmonic minor scale and has a chromatic passing tone (an additional 7) between the 6th and the 7th notes. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 8/4 c4^\\\\markup { Bebop harmonic minor scale on C } d es f g aes bes b c } } It contains all of the notes of both the harmonic minor scale and the natural minor scale (Aeolian mode) of the same root. It can be used on all three chords of a minor II-V-I progression. It is a mode of the bebop major scale: for instance, the C bebop harmonic minor scale has the same pitches as the E bebop major scale.

He was an important figure in introducing rock and roll music in France. He was an admirer of Elvis Presley, who influenced both his singing and looks. His stage name came from the character, Deke Rivers, that Presley played in his second film, Loving You (1957).  Biography  Rivers was born in Nice, France. He started his music career in 1960 as the lead singer of the band Les Chats Sauvages, cutting his first record on his fifteenth birthday. In 1961, the British music magazine NME reported that a Rivers concert with his group Les Chats Sauvages at the Palais des Sports de Paris, whilst headlining with Vince Taylor, had turned into a full-scale riot.

Chris Barber Band (Netherlands, February 1957) Monty Sunshine (9 April 1928 ‚Äì 30 November 2010) was an English jazz clarinetist, who is known for his clarinet solo on the track \\"Petite Fleur\\", a million seller for the Chris Barber Jazz Band in 1959. During his career, Sunshine worked with the Eager Beavers, the Crane River Jazz Band, Beryl Bryden, George Melly, Chris Barber, Johnny Parker, Diz Disley and Donegan's Dancing Sushine Band. Biography Born in Stepney, London, England, he along with Lonnie Donegan, Jim Bray and Ron Bowden, formed the back line of what was the embryo Chris Barber Band. Ken Colyer was the first trumpet player, with Sunshine on clarinet, and the original 1953 band took the Colyer name until there was a split from Colyer in May 1954. Pat Halcox, who only turned the band down originally as he wanted to carry on his studies, took over the spot, and the band formally adopted the Chris Barber Jazz Band as its title. The band quickly made an international reputation following their inaugural tour of Denmark, before their professional debut in the United Kingdom. Sunshine stayed with the band for several years, until he left in 1960, to be replaced by Ian Wheeler. He formed his own band, staying true to the original six man line up, whilst Barber expanded his band membership to seven, then eight and finally to eleven. In January 1963, the British music magazine NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace. The event included George Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Alex Welsh, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Sunshine. Sunshine returned to play a reunion concert with the original Chris Barber Band at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon in June 1975. This was well received, and the band reformed once again for an international reunion tour in 1994. Sunshine retired from music around 2001. His discography is extensive, and CDs have been issued of recordings with Colyer and Barber, as well as with his own band. He died in November 2010, at the age of 82.

The musicians for the sessions were Chet Atkins, lead guitar; Velma E. Williams Smith, guitar; Jerry Byrd, steel guitar; Ernie Newton, bass; and Hal Smith, fiddle. The session, The Davis Sisters' first in Nashville, Tennessee was recorded at Thomas Productions. The song tells the story of the ex-girlfriend of a young man warning his smug, ruthless current flame who stole him away that she'll lose him too one day \\"when his love goes cold.\\" The song is sung completely in duet harmony by Skeeter and Betty Jack with the exception of the lines \\"You stole his love from me one day, you didn't care how you hurt me, but you can never steal away memories of what used to be\\" which is sung by Betty Jack. Chart Performance The song was a number one country music single for The Davis Sisters in 1953. The, was the first hit for the duo of Skeeter Davis and Betty Jack Davis and their only one as Betty Jack was killed in an automobile accident the week the record was released. \\"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know\\" was a blockbuster hit, the only number one country song by a female duet until the rise of The Judds some thirty years later. The song stayed at number one on the country charts for eight weeks. \\"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know\\" ranks among the top 100 country hits of all time according to chart historian Joel Whitburn. Cover Versions Many artists have recorded versions of the song including: *Skeeter Davis rerecorded the song as an album track for her first solo album, 1959's I'll Sing You a Song and Harmonize Too and continued to sing the song throughout her career. The song was second only to her blockbuster crossover hit \\"The End of the World\\" as her most popular number in concerts. Elvis Presley told Davis that it was one of his favorite country records and Roy Acuff frequently requested she sing the song at the Grand Ole Opry. * Bob Dylan (on Self Portrait) *In 1960, Sonny James scored a modest pop hit with his version, which peaked at #80 on the Hot 100. *Jeanne Pruett had a mid-level charting country single with it in 1972. *Johnny Cash *Jerry Lee Lewis *Patti Page *Kitty Wells *Jimmie Rodgers *Roy Drusky, Del Reeves *The Statler Brothers *Slim Whitman *Jann Browne with Wanda Jackson *Patty Loveless, and the trio of Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette. *Dylan and Tom Petty performed the song as a duet in their 1986 True Confessions Tour *Elvis Costello recorded the song as a duet with Tom Waits on the album Such Unlikely Covers. *Swedish rock artist-songwriter Svante Karlsson covered it on his debut album American Songs in 1999. *In 2006, The Perrys recorded as a Southern-gospel number, \\"He Forgot More Than I'll Ever Know\\". *Esther Phillips covered also it on her album The country side of Esther Phillips in 1966, I've Forgotten More Than You'll Ever Know About Him.

The league marketed itself as a Junior A league, but was an unsanctioned independent loop with its own rules, processes and procedures, and was marked by franchise instability. Its team logos were based on the old WHA pro league of the 1970s. History The first game in league history (when it was known as the WHA Junior West Hockey League) took place on September 21, 2006, between the Lumby Fighting Saints and the Armstrong Sharks in Armstrong, British Columbia. The result of the game was a 6-4 victory for Lumby. On November 15, 2006, the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League announced its affiliation with the World Hockey Association and the creation of the \\"National Junior Hockey Alliance,\\" an agreement to play for the \\"Alliance Cup\\" between the GMHL playoff champion and the winner of the WHA Junior West Hockey League. On March 2, 2007, the JWHL final was awarded to New Westminster after winning the best of five series. Lumby pulled out of the league final after a financial dispute between Lumby's coach and the league; the league chose to remove Lumby's coach and continued the series without him. The Whalers won the last two games to take the league title. The Whalers moved on to compete for the Alliance Cup against the Greater Metro League's Bradford Rattlers, and were swept three games straight by the GMJHL champion. On March 2, 2007, Vancouver Tours Bus Lines was awarded $71,348 CAD in unpaid fees by the WHA by a British Columbia Court. The WHA lost its Bellingham franchise in the fall of 2007, but gained the Fort Vancouver Pioneers. The Pioneers received much scrutiny in USA Hockey's NorPac league due to allegations of \\"overcompensating\\" their players and violating their amateur status. The team was founded in 2003 as the Portland Pioneers and won two league championships. On October 28, 2007, the Fort Vancouver Pioneers ceased operations following the WHA reneging on travel arrangements made with the club. The Pioneers had a league best 7-1-0-0 record with 61 goals for and 27 goals against. Late in November, the transplanted 2007 champion Whalers (3-6-0-0 with 40 GF and 49 GA) seemingly folded and their players were moved in with the Osoyoos Spurs franchise. The remaining teams played little more than half the schedule before the season was cut short,MORE and a \\"championship\\" series played between the Oliver Jets and the Armstrong Sharks. After a second season cut short and the playoffs won by the Oliver Jets with little notice, there was no sign of any renewal of the \\"Alliance Cup.\\" In the summer of 2008, the WHA announced the addition of teams in Hope, Ashcroft, Nakusp, Clinton and Logan Lake. From the 2007-08 season, the WHA lost Barrhead, Fort Vancouver, Osoyoos, Squamish, and Vancouver, but announced that it had retained Armstrong, Lumby and Oliver. Furthermore, the league announced in July 2008 that it had secured affiliation deals with the Varkaus Eagles of Finland and Red Star-Sofia in Bulgaria. As part of the arrangement, WHA owner Ricky Smith was given control of the Eagles, but subsequently defaulted on a $75,000 bond and unilaterally folded the team.http://www.varkauseagles.com/cgi- bin/pressrelease/pr.pl?action=view&recordid;=3208-1 No WHA franchise apparently attempted to field a roster for the scheduled start of the 2008-2009 season, and no games were ever played. The last post to the league's website was on September 15, 2008 - which as of July 2009 was shut down for lack of payment - addressing the possible suspension by Hockey Canada of any player suiting up for a WHA team. On January 16, 2009, the WHA was successfully sued by Global Developments Inc. for US$4.3 Million in losses in a District of Nevada courtroom for purposely diluting the worth of Global's interest in the company. In addition, the WHA was ordered to repay $277,386 in loans provided to them by Global. Under Smith, the share price of the WHA fell from $3.45 to less than one cent, before being taken off the trading market. On November 24, 2009, Ricky Smith filed a lawsuit in British Columbia against Hockey Canada, the Pacific International Junior Hockey League, BC Hockey, former WHA Coach Matt Samson, and Squamish Manager of Recreational Services Janet Gugins. The charges stem from Smith's belief that Hockey Canada and BC Hockey maliciously targeted the WHA in the summer of 2008 with a series of bulletins targeted at keeping players from joining the WHA. The charges put against Samson, Gugins, and the PIJHL revolve around allegations that Samson and Gugins were in breach of a contract between them and the WHA when attempting to secure a PIJHL franchise. The outcome of the lawsuit is unclear.

A leading youth international goalkeeper for West Germany in 1978, Eike Immel was still seventeen years of age when he succeeded Horst Bertram as Borussia Dortmund's first-choice. He remained Dortmund's top choice until his two million Deutsche Mark transfer to VfB Stuttgart in 1986, the biggest fee ever paid for a goalkeeper in the history German football at that time. He served nine years as Stuttgart's regular goalkeeper, winning the Bundesliga title in 1992 and the UEFA Cup runner-up medal in 1989 with them. Afterwards he left for Manchester City, where he retired at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. He played 534 matches in the German top flight. His West Germany career lasted for just eight years due to his decision to retire from the West German team following EURO'88. Immel had been the starting goalkeeper since Harald Schumacher's ban from the team in 1987, and his 19th appearance in the semi-final of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship at Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, remained his final cap for his country and made him miss out on the title winning 1990 FIFA World Cup squad for which Bodo Illgner then served as starting goalkeeper. The mentioned 1988 UEFA European Football Championship was Immel's fifth participation in a big international tournament. The son of a farmer later admitted his decision to retire from the international game at barely 28 just because of the competition from Bodo Illgner for the goalkeeper's jersey, was extremely hasty. He was however part of the squad that won the 1980 UEFA European Championships. Following his retirement from the game after a stay with Manchester City, whom he joined after his Stuttgart manager had preferred a younger goalkeeper in 1995, Eike Immel was working in a coaching role, performing a similar role under Christoph Daum at Fenerbah√ße in 2005. Immel currently holds the dubious record for 'most goals conceded by a Bundesliga goalkeeper' with 829 goals conceded in 534 games.

Her husband was Emperor Wen (Yuan Baoju).  Background  Her ancestors were ancestral chiefs of a branch tribe of Tuyuhun, and later became vassals of Northern Wei. After Northern Wei conquered Northern Liang in 439, her great-great-grandfather Yifu Mogui (‰πôÂºóËé´Áìå) led his tribe into Northern Wei and became a Northern Wei general. For three generations following his, the Yifus married Northern Wei princesses, and their daughters often married Northern Wei imperial princes. Her father Yifu Yuan (‰πôÂºóÁëó) was a provincial governor, and her mother was the Princess Huaiyang, a daughter of Emperor Xiaowen. In 525, when she was 15, she married Yuan Baoju, who was then 21 and a general under his cousin Emperor Xiaoming, but who carried no noble title because his father Yuan Yu (ÂÖÉÊÑâ) the Prince of Jingzhao had had his title stripped posthumously in a rebellion. In 535, after Northern Wei had split into Eastern Wei and Western Wei, he was made emperor (as Emperor Wen) by the general Yuwen Tai after the death of his cousin Emperor Xiaowu. He created her empress and created her son Yuan Qin crown prince.  As empress  As empress, Empress Yifu was said to be frugal, avoiding extravagant clothing, jewelry, and food, often eating just vegetables. She was also said to be kind and tolerant and never jealous, and Emperor Wen respected her greatly. She bore him 12 children, although only Yuan Qin and Yuan Wu (ÂÖÉÊàä) the Prince of Wudu survived infancy. In 538, with Western Wei occupied with wars against Eastern Wei and unable to defend itself against attacks by Rouran, Yuwen Tai wanted to further relationships with Rouran through an imperial marriage. He first had Emperor Wen create the daughter of the official Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÁøå) as the Princess Huazheng and marry her to the Rouran Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul√º Anagui's brother Yujiul√º Tahan (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â°îÂØí), and then further asked Emperor Wen to marry Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen was forced to agree. He deposed Empress Yifu and made her become a Buddhist nun, and he created Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter empress.  Death  Even though Empress Yifu had been deposed and made a nun, however, Empress Yujiul√º was still jealous of her. To avoid conflict, in 540, Emperor Wen made Yuan Wu the governor of Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu), and had Empress Yifu accompany Yuan Wu to his post. Emperor Wen, still harboring love for her in his heart, secretly requested that she start keeping her hair uncut so that he could eventually welcome her back to the palace. Unfortunately, around the same time, Rouran launched a major attack against Western Wei, and a number of officials believed that the Rouran attack was made on behalf of Empress Yujiul√º. Emperor Wen, with the officials pressuring him, sent his eunuch Cao Chong (ÊõπÂØµ) to Qin Province to order Empress Yifu to commit suicide. She made the comment to Cao: :May it be that His Imperial majesty live for a thousand years, and the empire is happy and calm. I do not have regrets about death. She then committed suicide, and was buried with honors due an empress, albeit not near the capital Chang'an, but instead at the Maiji Cliffs (È∫•Á©çÂ¥ñ), near Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ) the capital of Qin Province. It was not until later, when Yuan Qin was emperor, that she was reburied with Emperor Wen.  References  * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 157, 158. * History of Northern Dynasties, vols. 5 , 13 .

It was announced in December 1963, with first installations in June 1964. Description An SDS 930 system consists of at least three standard () cabinets, comprising the arithmetic and logic unit, at least 8,192 words (24-bit + simple parity bit) magnetic-core memory, and the IO unit. Two's complement integer arithmetic is used. The machine has integer multiply and divide, but no floating-point hardware. An optional correlation and filtering unit (CFE) can be added, which is capable of very fast floating-point multiply-add operations (primarily intended for digital signal processing applications). Weighed about .CPU (single memory bank): 1150 lb, PS cabinet: 1200 lb, I/O cabinet: 700 lb, control console: 150 lb. See A free-standing console is also provided, which includes binary displays of the machine's registers and switches to boot and debug programs. User input is by a Teletype Model 35 ASR unit and a high-speed paper-tape reader (300 cps). Most systems include at least two magnetic-tape drives, operating at up to 75 in/s at 800 bpi. The normal variety of peripherals is also available, including magnetic-drum units, card readers and punches, and an extensive set of analog-digital/digital-analog conversion devices. A (vector mode) graphic display unit is also available, but it does not include a means of keyboard input. The SDS 930 is a typical small- to medium-scale scientific computer of the 1960s. Speed is good for its cost, but with an integer add time of 3.5 microseconds, it is not in the same league as the scientific workhorses of the day (the CDC 6600, for example). A well equipped 930 can easily exceed 10 cabinets and require a climate-controlled room. The price of such a system in 1966 would be in the neighborhood of $500K. Programming languages available include FORTRAN II, ALGOL 60, and the assembly language known as Meta-Symbol. The FORTRAN system is very compact, having been designed and implemented by Digitek for SDS to compile and run in 4,096 word SDS 900 series machines. To do anything useful in such small memory space, the compiler relies on an SDS architectural feature known as Programmed OPeratorS, or POPS. This feature consists of a single bit in the instruction word that causes the machine to \\"mark place and branch\\" to the memory address of the instruction code value plus 100 (octal). As a result, pseudo instructions can be defined and implemented yielding very compact special- purpose code. Both the FORTRAN compiler and runtime take advantage of this capability.A programmed operator was a hardware concept on the SDS 900 series of computers similar to the concept of the Atlas computer's \\"extracodes\\". The programmed operator calling mechanism allowed computer operation codes to be interpreted by software code. See Scientific Data Systems, \\"SDS 900 Series\\", technical manual. Cf. Programmed Operator. Also see \\"SDS 910 Reference Manual\\", February 1970. Cf. Appendix E. page A-19, \\"Programmed Operators\\" for an in-depth discussion of Programmed Operators.Bell, Gordon, \\"Computer Structures: Readings and Examples\\", Section 6: Processors with multiprogramming ability, p.275. \\"The [SDS] 940 uses a memory map which is almost a subset of that of Atlas but is more modest than that of the IBM 360/67 [Arden et al., 1966] and GE 645 [Dennis, 1965; Daley and Dennis, 1968]. A number of instructions are apparently built in via the programmed operator calling mechanism, based on Atlas extracodes (Chap. 23). The software-defined instructions emphasize the need for hardware features. For example, floating- point arithmetic is needed when several computer-bound programs are run. The SDS 945 is a successor to the 940, with slightly increased capability but at a lower cost.\\" Towards the end of the SDS 930's market lifetime a real-time monitor system was introduced, which included a FORTRAN IV compiler. Neither the operating system nor the compiler were used heavily by customers. Many organizations modified and enhanced the 930's hardware. Project Genie at the University of California, Berkeley, added hardware to permit time-sharing with the Berkeley Timesharing System. These changes later formed the basis for the SDS 940. Other operating systems were also written for the machine by customers, including Arachnid (Spider) at the University of Texas at Austin. SDS 930s could be found at most of the major US government labs at the time, including Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Early flight simulators used the SDS 930, because of its hardware integer multiply and divide capability and its real-time data acquisition and control peripheral modules. The machines are particularly well suited to this and other kinds of data acquisition and real-time analysis, as well as to serving as a digital control system for analog-hybrid systems. The Surface Ship ASW Attack Trainer (Device 14A2A) used a SDS 930 computer and was designed to train the ASW attack team of a US Navy destroyer in submarine warfare by providing realistic simulations ashore with cost savings in operating time and expense at sea.

Winter 1966-1967. page 34-38. https://books.google.com/books?id=j0lepyMcE-sC By 1974 estimates, there were about 200 SDS-930/940/945 computers still installed.

An unconventional form of monetary policy,Michael Joyce, David Miles, Andrew Scott & Dimitri Vayanos, Quantitative Easing and Unconventional Monetary Policy ‚Äì An Introduction, The Economic Journal, Vol. 122, No. 564 (November 2012), pp. F271-F288: \\"The most high-profile form of unconventional monetary policy has been Quantitative Easing (QE).\\" it is usually used when inflation is very low or negative, and standard expansionary monetary policy has become ineffective. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply. This differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value. Expansionary monetary policy to stimulate the economy typically involves the central bank buying short-term government bonds to decrease short-term market interest rates. However, when short-term interest rates approach or reach zero, this method can no longer work (a situation known as a liquidity trap). In such circumstances, monetary authorities may then use quantitative easing to further stimulate the economy, by buying financial assets without reference to interest rates, and by buying riskier or longer maturity assets (other than short-term government bonds), thereby lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve. Quantitative easing can help bring the economy out of recessionJoseph E. Gagnon, Quantitative Easing: An Underappreciated Success, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Policy Brief 16-4 (April 2016). and help ensure that inflation does not fall below the central bank's inflation target.Ricardo Reis, \\"Funding Quantitative Easing to Target Inflation,\\" in \\"Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future,‚Äù Proceedings of the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, August 2016, pp. 423‚Äì478. Risks include the policy being more effective than intended in acting against deflation (leading to higher inflation in the longer term), or not being effective enough if banks remain reluctant to lend and potential borrowers are unwilling to borrow. According to the International Monetary Fund, the US Federal Reserve System, and various other economists, quantitative easing undertaken following the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 mitigated some of the economic problems after the crisis. It has also been used by several major central banks (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Process  Standard central bank monetary policies are usually enacted by buying or selling government bonds on the open market to reach a desired target for the interbank interest rate. However, if a recession or depression continues even when a central bank has lowered interest rates to nearly zero, the central bank can no longer lower interest rates ‚Äî a situation known as the liquidity trap. The central bank may then implement quantitative easing by buying financial assets without reference to interest rates. This policy is sometimes described as a last resort to stimulate the economy. A central bank enacts quantitative easing by purchasing, regardless of interest rates, a predetermined quantity of bonds or other financial assets on financial markets from private financial institutions. This action increases the excess reserves that banks hold. The goal of this policy is to ease financial conditions, increase market liquidity, and facilitate an expansion of private bank lending. Quantitative easing affects the economy through several channels: * Credit channel: By providing liquidity in the banking sector, QE makes it easier and cheaper for banks to extend loans to companies and households, thus stimulating credit growth. Additionally, if the central bank also purchases financial instruments that are riskier than government bonds (such as corporate bonds), it can also increase the price and lower the interest yield of these riskier assets. * Portfolio rebalancing: By enacting QE, the central bank withdraws an important part of the safe assets from the market onto its own balance sheet, which may result in private investors turning to other financial securities. Because of the relative lack of government bonds, investors are forced to \\"rebalance their portfolios\\" into other assets. Additionally, if the central bank also purchases financial instruments that are riskier than government bonds, it can also lower the interest yield of those assets (as those assets are more scarce in the market, and thus their prices go up correspondingly). * Exchange rate: Because it increases the money supply and lowers the yield of financial assets, QE tends to depreciate a country's exchange rates relative to other currencies, through the interest rate mechanism. Lower interest rates lead to a capital outflow from a country, thereby reducing foreign demand for a country's money, leading to a weaker currency. This increases demand for exports, and directly benefits exporters and export industries in the country. * Fiscal effect: By lowering yields on sovereign bonds, QE makes it cheaper for governments to borrow on financial markets, which may empower the government to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy. Quantitative easing can be viewed as a debt refinancing operation of the \\"consolidated government\\" (the government including the central bank), whereby the consolidated government, via the central bank, retires government debt securities and refinances them into central bank reserves. * Boosting asset prices: When a central bank buys government bonds from a pension fund, the pension fund, rather than hold on to this money, it might invest it in financial assets, such as shares, that gives it a higher return. And when demand for financial assets is high, the value of these assets increases. This makes businesses and households holding shares wealthier ‚Äì making them more likely to spend more, boosting economic activity. *Signalling effect: Some economists argue that QE's main impact is due to its effect on the psychology of the markets, by signalling that the central bank will take extraordinary steps to facilitate economic recovery. For instance, it has been observed that most of the effect of QE in the Eurozone on bond yields happened between the date of the announcement of QE and the actual start of the purchases by the ECB.  History   Precedents  The US Federal Reserve belatedly implemented policies similar to the recent quantitative easing during the Great Depression of the 1930s.Hoover Institution, Economics Working Paper 14110, \\"Exiting from Low Interest Rates to Normality: An Historical Perspective\\", November 2014 Retrieved 10 March 2015. Specifically, banks' excess reserves exceeded 6 percent in 1940, whereas they vanished during the entire postwar period until 2008.Stefan Homburg (2017) A Study in Monetary Macroeconomics, Oxford University Press, .

Werner, \\"New Evidence on the Effectiveness of 'Quantitative Easing' in Japan\\", Centre for Banking, Finance and Sustainable Development, School of Management, University of Southampton. The BOJ had maintained short-term interest rates at close to zero since 1999. The Bank of Japan had for many years, and as late as February 2001, stated that \\"quantitative easing ... is not effective\\" and rejected its use for monetary policy.Hiroshi Fujiki et al., \\"Monetary Policy under Zero Interest Rate: Viewpoints of Central Bank Economists\\", Monetary and Economic Studies, February 2001, p. 98.

Retrieved 9 August 2010. Under quantitative easing, the BOJ flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity to promote private lending, leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves and therefore little risk of a liquidity shortage.\\"Easing Out of the Bank of Japan's Monetary Easing Policy\\" (2004‚Äì33, 19 November 2004). Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than would be required to set the interest rate to zero. It later also bought asset-backed securities and equities and extended the terms of its commercial paper-purchasing operation. The BOJ increased commercial bank current account balances from ¬•5 trillion to ¬•35 trillion (approximately US$300 billion) over a four-year period starting in March 2001. The BOJ also tripled the quantity of long-term Japan government bonds it could purchase on a monthly basis. However, the seven-fold increase notwithstanding, current account balances (essentially central bank reserves) being just one (usually relatively small) component of the liability side of a central bank's balance sheet (the main one being banknotes), the resulting peak increase in the BOJ's balance sheet was modest, compared to later actions by other central banks.  After 2007  Since the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, policies similar to those undertaken by Japan have been used by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Eurozone. Quantitative easing was used by these countries because their risk-free short-term nominal interest rates (termed the federal funds rate in the US, or the official bank rate in the UK) were either at or close to zero. During the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, the US Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet dramatically by adding new assets and new liabilities without \\"sterilizing\\" these by corresponding subtractions. In the same period, the United Kingdom also used quantitative easing as an additional arm of its monetary policy to alleviate its financial crisis.Alloway, Tracy, The Unthinkable Has Happened, ft.com, 10 November 2008.

In late November 2008, the Federal Reserve started buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities. By March 2009, it held $1.75 trillion of bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury notes; this amount reached a peak of $2.1 trillion in June 2010. Further purchases were halted as the economy started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. After the halt in June, holdings started falling naturally as debt matured and were projected to fall to $1.7 trillion by 2012. The Fed's revised goal became to keep holdings at $2.054 trillion. To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in two- to ten-year Treasury notes every month. In November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, buying $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.\\"What is the Federal Reserve Quantitative Easing\\". useconomy.about.com (22 September 2011). The expression \\"QE2\\" became a ubiquitous nickname in 2010, used to refer to this second round of quantitative easing by US central banks. Retrospectively, the round of quantitative easing preceding QE2 was called \\"QE1\\". A third round of quantitative easing, \\"QE3\\", was announced on 13 September 2012. In an 11‚Äì1 vote, the Federal Reserve decided to launch a new $40 billion per month, open- ended bond purchasing program of agency mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would likely maintain the federal funds rate near zero \\"at least through 2015\\". According to NASDAQ.com, this is effectively a stimulus program that allows the Federal Reserve to relieve $40 billion per month of commercial housing market debt risk. Because of its open-ended nature, QE3 has earned the popular nickname of \\"QE-Infinity\\".Jason Haver (14 September 2012). \\"QE-Infinity: Poking Holes in Bernanke's Logic\\". Accessed 18 August 2018. On 12 December 2012, the FOMC announced an increase in the amount of open-ended purchases from $40 billion to $85 billion per month. On 19 June 2013, Ben Bernanke announced a \\"tapering\\" of some of the Fed's QE policies contingent upon continued positive economic data. Specifically, he said that the Fed could scale back its bond purchases from $85 billion to $65 billion a month during the upcoming September 2013 policy meeting. He also suggested that the bond- buying program could wrap up by mid-2014. While Bernanke did not announce an interest rate hike, he suggested that if inflation followed a 2% target rate and unemployment decreased to 6.5%, the Fed would likely start raising rates. The stock markets dropped by approximately 4.3% over the three trading days following Bernanke's announcement, with the Dow Jones dropping 659 points between 19 and 24 June, closing at 14,660 at the end of the day on 24 June. On 18 September 2013, the Fed decided to hold off on scaling back its bond-buying program, and announced in December 2013 that it would begin to taper its purchases in January 2014. Purchases were halted on 29 October 2014 after accumulating $4.5 trillion in assets.  US QE4  Increase in US Federal Reserve assets in response to COVID-19 pandemic[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm In September 2019, the Federal Reserve began conducting its fourth quantitative easing operation since the 2008 financial crisis; on 15 March 2020, it announced approximately $700 billion in new quantitative easing via asset purchases to support US liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of mid-summer 2020 this resulted in an additional $2 trillion in assets on the books of the Federal Reserve.  United Kingdom  Immediate and delayed effects of quantitative easing During its QE programme, the Bank of England bought gilts from financial institutions, along with a smaller amount of relatively high-quality debt issued by private companies. The banks, insurance companies, and pension funds could then use the money they received for lending or even to buy back more bonds from the bank. Further, the central bank could lend the new money to private banks or buy assets from banks in exchange for currency. These measures have the effect of depressing interest yields on government bonds and similar investments, making it cheaper for business to raise capital. Another side effect is that investors will switch to other investments, such as shares, boosting their price and thus encouraging consumption. QE can reduce interbank overnight interest rates and thereby encourage banks to loan money to higher interest-paying and financially weaker bodies. Beginning in March 2009, the Bank of England had purchased around ¬£165 billion in assets as of September 2009 and around ¬£175 billion in assets by the end of October 2009. At its meeting in November 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to increase total asset purchases to ¬£200 billion. Most of the assets purchased have been UK government securities (gilts); the Bank has also purchased smaller quantities of high-quality private-sector assets. In December 2010, MPC member Adam Posen called for a ¬£50 billion expansion of the Bank's quantitative easing programme, while his colleague Andrew Sentance has called for an increase in interest rates due to inflation being above the target rate of 2%. In October 2011, the Bank of England announced that it would undertake another round of QE, creating an additional ¬£75 billion. In February 2012 it announced an additional ¬£50 billion. In July 2012 it announced another ¬£50 billion,Publications Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and increases size of Asset Purchase Programme by ¬£50 billion to ¬£375 billion. Bank of England. bringing the total amount to ¬£375 billion. The Bank has said that it will not buy more than 70% of any issue of government debt. This means that at least 30% of any issue of government debt will have to be purchased and held by institutions other than the Bank of England. In 2012 the Bank estimated that quantitative easing had benefited households differentially according to the assets they hold; richer households have more assets. In August 2016, the Bank of England said it would buy an additional ¬£60bn of UK government bonds and ¬£10bn of corporate bonds, to address uncertainty over Brexit and worries about productivity and economic growth. In an emergency meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Bank announced ¬£200bn purchases of government bonds, bringing the total to ¬£645bn.  Eurozone and Switzerland  The European Central Bank said that it would focus on buying covered bonds, a form of corporate debt. It signalled that its initial purchases would be worth about ‚Ç¨60 billion in May 2009. At the beginning of 2013, the Swiss National Bank had the largest balance sheet relative to the size of the economy it was responsible for, at close to 100% of Switzerland's national output. A total of 12% of its reserves were in foreign equities. By contrast, the US Federal Reserve's holdings equalled about 20% of US GDP, while the European Central Bank's assets were worth 30% of GDP. In a dramatic change of policy, following the new Jackson Hole Consensus, on 22 January 2015 Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, announced an \\"expanded asset purchase programme\\", where ‚Ç¨60 billion per month of euro-area bonds from central governments, agencies and European institutions would be bought. Beginning in March 2015, the stimulus was planned to last until September 2016 at the earliest with a total QE of at least ‚Ç¨1.1 trillion. Mario Draghi announced the programme would continue: \\"until we see a continued adjustment in the path of inflation\\", referring to the ECB's need to combat the growing threat of deflation across the eurozone in early 2015. On 10 March 2016, the ECB increased its monthly bond purchases to ‚Ç¨80 billion from ‚Ç¨60 billion and started to include corporate bonds under the asset purchasing programme and announced new ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks. After a short pause of about a year, the ECB resumed buying up eurozone government bonds at a rate of ‚Ç¨20 billion as from November 2019 in an effort to encourage governments to borrow more and spend in domestic investment projects. On 18 March 2020, to help the economy absorb the shock of the COVID-19 crisis, the ECB announced a ‚Ç¨750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). The aim of the stimulus package (PEPP) was to lower borrowing costs and increase lending in the euro area.  Sweden  Sveriges Riksbank launched quantitative easing in February 2015, announcing government bond purchases of nearly US$1.2 billion.Sweden cuts rates below zero and starts QE BBC News, Business, 12 February 2015 The annualised inflation rate in January 2015 was minus 0.3 percent, and the bank implied that Sweden's economy could slide into deflation.  Japan after 2007 and Abenomics  In early October 2010, the Bank of Japan announced that it would examine the purchase of ¬•5 trillion (US$60 billion) in assets. This was an attempt to push down the value of the yen against the US dollar to stimulate the domestic economy by making Japanese exports cheaper; however, it was ineffective.\\"Quantitative Easing ‚Äì A lesson learned from Japan\\".

Banking Times (4 August 2011). In October 2011, the Bank expanded its asset purchase program by ¬•5 trillion ($66bn) to a total of ¬•55 trillion. On 4 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that it would expand its asset purchase program by 60 to 70 trillion Yen a year. The Bank hoped to bring Japan from deflation to inflation, aiming for 2% inflation. The amount of purchases was so large that it was expected to double the money supply. This policy has been named Abenomics, as a portmanteau of economic policies and Shinz≈ç Abe, the current Prime Minister of Japan. On 31 October 2014, the BOJ announced the expansion of its bond buying program, to now buy ¬•80 trillion of bonds a year.  Efficacy  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the quantitative easing policies undertaken by the central banks of the major developed countries since the beginning of the late-2000s financial crisis have contributed to the reduction in systemic risks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. The IMF states that the policies also contributed to the improvements in market confidence and the bottoming-out of the recession in the G7 economies in the second half of 2009.Unconventional Choices for Unconventional Times: Credit and Quantitative Easing in Advanced Economies; by Vladimir Klyuev, Phil de Imus, and Krishna Srinivasan; IMF Staff Position Note SPN/09/27; 4 November 2009.. (PDF). Economist Martin Feldstein argues that QE2 led to a rise in the stock market in the second half of 2010, which in turn contributed to increasing consumption and the strong performance of the US economy in late 2010. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calculated that as of July 2012, there was \\"very little impact on the economy\\".Navarro, Bruno J. (12 July 2012). \\"CNBC Coverage of Greenspan\\". Finance.yahoo.com. Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein has said that measures of quantitive easing such as large-scale asset purchases \\"have played a significant role in supporting economic activity\\". According to Neil Irwin, senior economic correspondent at The New York Times, quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve likely contributed to: i) Lower interest rates for corporate bonds and mortgage rates, helping support housing prices; ii) Higher stock market valuation, in terms of a higher price-earnings ratio for the S&P; 500 index; iii) Increased inflation rate and investor's expectations for future inflation; iv) Higher rate of job creation; and v) Higher rate of GDP growth. Several studies published in the aftermath of the crisis found Large Scale Asset Purchases to have lowered long term interest rates on a variety of securities as well as lower credit risk. The impacts were to modestly increase inflation and boost GDP growth.Gilchrist, Simon, and Egon Zakraj≈°ek. \\"The Impact of the Federal Reserve's Large‚ÄêScale Asset Purchase Programs on Corporate Credit Risk\\".

Risks and side-effects Quantitative easing may cause higher inflation than desired if the amount of easing required is overestimated and too much money is created by the purchase of liquid assets. On the other hand, QE can fail to spur demand if banks remain reluctant to lend money to businesses and households. Even then, QE can still ease the process of deleveraging as it lowers yields. However, there is a time lag between monetary growth and inflation; inflationary pressures associated with money growth from QE could build before the central bank acts to counter them. Inflationary risks are mitigated if the system's economy outgrows the pace of the increase of the money supply from the easing. If production in an economy increases because of the increased money supply, the value of a unit of currency may also increase, even though there is more currency available. For example, if a nation's economy were to spur a significant increase in output at a rate at least as high as the amount of debt monetized, the inflationary pressures would be equalized. This can only happen if member banks actually lend the excess money out instead of hoarding the extra cash. During times of high economic output, the central bank always has the option of restoring reserves to higher levels through raising interest rates or other means, effectively reversing the easing steps taken. Economists such as John TaylorJohn B. Taylor, The Fed‚Äôs New View is a Little Less Scary, 20 June 2013 blog post believe that quantitative easing creates unpredictability. Since the increase in bank reserves may not immediately increase the money supply if held as excess reserves, the increased reserves create the danger that inflation may eventually result when the reserves are loaned out.John Taylor, Stanford, 2012 testimony before House Financial Service Committee, page two , retrieved 20 October 2013. QE benefits debtors, since the interest rate has fallen, meaning there is less money to be repaid. However, it directly harms creditors as they earn less money from lower interest rates. Devaluation of a currency also directly harms importers and consumers, as the cost of imported goods is inflated by the devaluation of the currency.  Impact on savings and pensions  In the European Union, World Pensions Council (WPC) financial economists have also argued that artificially low government bond interest rates induced by QE will have an adverse impact on the underfunding condition of pension funds, since \\"without returns that outstrip inflation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years\\". In addition to this, low or negative interest rates create disincentives for saving. In a way this is an intended effect, since QE is intended to spur consumer spending.  Capital flight  According to Bloomberg reporter David Lynch, the new money from quantitative easing could be used by the banks to invest in emerging markets, commodity- based economies, commodities themselves, and non-local opportunities rather than to lend to local businesses that are having difficulty getting loans.  Increased income and wealth inequality  Critics frequently point to the redistributive effects of quantitative easing. For instance, British Prime Minister Theresa May openly criticized QE in July 2016 for its regressive effects: \\"Monetary policy ‚Äì in the form of super-low interest rates and quantitative easing ‚Äì has helped those on the property ladder at the expense of those who can't afford to own their own home.\\" Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research wrote that \\"QE cash ends up overwhelmingly in profits, thereby exacerbating already extreme income inequality and the consequent social tensions that arise from it\\". Anthony Randazzo of the Reason Foundation wrote that QE \\"is fundamentally a regressive redistribution program that has been boosting wealth for those already engaged in the financial sector or those who already own homes, but passing little along to the rest of the economy. It is a primary driver of income inequality\\". Those criticisms are partly based on some evidence provided by central banks themselves. In 2012, a Bank of England report showed that its quantitative easing policies had benefited mainly the wealthy, and that 40% of those gains went to the richest 5% of British households. In May 2013, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said that cheap money has made rich people richer, but has not done quite as much for working Americans. Answering similar criticisms expressed by MEP Molly Scott Cato, the President of the ECB Mario Draghi once declared: > Some of these policies may, on the one hand, increase inequality but, on the > other hand, if we ask ourselves what the major source of inequality is, the > answer would be unemployment. So, to the extent that these policies help ‚Äì > and they are helping on that front ‚Äì then certainly an accommodative > monetary policy is better in the present situation than a restrictive > monetary policy. In July 2018, the ECB published a study showing that its QE programme increased the net wealth of the poorest fifth of the population by 2.5 percent, compared with just 1.0 percent for the richest fifth. The study's credibility was however contested.  Criticism by BRIC countries  BRIC countries have criticized the QE carried out by the central banks of developed nations. They share the argument that such actions amount to protectionism and competitive devaluation. As net exporters whose currencies are partially pegged to the dollar, they protest that QE causes inflation to rise in their countries and penalizes their industries.Jeff Black and Zoe Schneeweis, China's Yi Warns on Currency Wars as Yuan in Equilibrium, Bloomberg News, 26 January 2013John Paul Rathbone and Jonathan Wheatley, Brazil's finance chief attacks US over QE3, Financial Times, 20 September 2012Richard Blackden, Brazil president Dilma Rousseff blasts Western QE as monetary tsunami, The Daily Telegraph (London), 10 April 2012Michael Steen and Alice Ross, Warning on new currency war, Financial Times, 22 January 2013 The world's leading emerging economies have urged Western governments to pursue \\"responsible\\" economic policies, in particular referring to quantitative easing. In a joint statement leaders of Russia, Brazil, India, China and South Africa, collectively BRICS, have condemned the policies of western economies saying \\"It is critical for advanced economies to adopt responsible macro-economic and financial policies, avoid creating excessive liquidity and undertake structural reforms to lift growth\\" as written in the Telegraph. Another criticism prevalent in Europe, is that it creates moral hazard for governments. Central banks‚Äô purchases of government securities artificially depress the cost of borrowing. Normally, governments issuing additional debt see their borrowing costs rise, which discourages them from overdoing it. In particular, market discipline in the form of higher interest rates will cause a government like Italy's, tempted to increase deficit spending, to think twice. Not so, however, when the central bank acts as bond buyer of last resort and is prepared to purchase government securities without limit. In such circumstances, market discipline will be incapacitated.  Political risk  Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, warned in 2010 that QE carries \\"the risk of being perceived as embarking on the slippery slope of debt monetization. We know that once a central bank is perceived as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, concern about debt monetization quickly arises.\\" Later in the same speech, he stated that the Fed is monetizing the government debt: \\"The math of this new exercise is readily transparent: The Federal Reserve will buy $110 billion a month in Treasuries, an amount that, annualized, represents the projected deficit of the federal government for next year. For the next eight months, the nation's central bank will be monetizing the federal debt.\\"Speeches by Richard W. Fisher. Dallas Fed (8 November 2010). Ben Bernanke remarked in 2002 that the US government had a technology called the printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), so that if rates reached zero and deflation threatened, the government could always act to ensure deflation was prevented. He said, however, that the government would not print money and distribute it \\"willy nilly\\" but would rather focus its efforts in certain areas (e.g., buying federal agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities).Wolf, Martin. (16 December 2008) \\"'Helicopter Ben' confronts the challenge of a lifetime\\". Financial Times.Speech, Bernanke -Deflation- 21 November 2002. Federal Reserve Bank. According to economist Robert McTeer, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, there is nothing wrong with printing money during a recession, and quantitative easing is different from traditional monetary policy \\"only in its magnitude and pre-announcement of amount and timing\\".  Terminology   Qualitative easing  Professor Willem Buiter of the London School of Economics has proposed a terminology to distinguish quantitative easing, or an expansion of a central bank's balance sheet, from what he terms qualitative easing, or the process of a central bank adding riskier assets to its balance sheet:  Credit easing  In introducing the Federal Reserve's response to the 2008‚Äì09 financial crisis, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke distinguished the new program, which he termed \\"credit easing\\", from Japanese-style quantitative easing. In his speech, he announced, Credit easing involves increasing the money supply by the purchase not of government bonds but of private-sector assets, such as corporate bonds and residential mortgage‚Äìbacked securities.Credit Easing Definition. Financial Times Lexicon.How Bernanke's Policy of 'Credit Easing' Works. BusinessWeek (28 January 2009). In 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities to support the sagging mortgage market. These purchases increased the monetary base in a way similar to a purchase of government securities.http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1014.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  Monetary financing  Quantitative easing has been nicknamed \\"printing money\\" by some members of the media,Stephanomics: Is quantitative easing really just printing money?.

Citywire.co.uk. central bankers, and financial analysts. Stephen Hester, chief executive officer of the RBS Group, said: > What the Bank of England does in quantitative easing is it prints money to > buy government debt, ... So the Quantitative Easing has enabled governments, > this government, to run a big budget deficit without killing the economy > because the Bank of England has financed it. Central banks in most developed nations (e.g., the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and the Eurozone) are prohibited from buying government debt directly from the government and must instead buy it from the secondary market.Stephanomics. BBC. This two-step process, where the government sells bonds to private entities that in turn sell them to the central bank, has been called \\"monetizing the debt\\" by many analysts. However, QE is a very different form of money creation than it is commonly understood when talking about \\"money printing\\". Indeed, the term printing money usually implies that newly created money is used to directly finance government deficits or pay off government debt (also known as monetizing the government debt). With QE, the newly created money is usually used to buy financial assets other than government bonds. Also, the Federal Reserve has mostly \\"sterilized\\" its bond purchases by paying interest to banks for reserve deposits. This removes money from circulation previously added by the Fed's bond purchases. The net effect is to raise bond prices, lowering borrowing rates for mortgages and other loans, without an inflationary increase in the money supply.Hilsenrath, J., Wall Street Journal, \\"Markets,\\" 3 July 1012 The distinguishing characteristic between QE and debt monetization is that with the former, the central bank creates money to stimulate the economy, not to finance government spending (although an indirect effect of QE is to lower rates on sovereign bonds). Also, the central bank has the stated intention of reversing the QE when the economy has recovered (by selling the government bonds and other financial assets back into the market). The only effective way to determine whether a central bank has monetized debt is to compare its performance relative to its stated objectives. Many central banks have adopted an inflation target. It is likely that a central bank is monetizing the debt if it continues to buy government debt when inflation is above target and if the government has problems with debt financing. Alternative policies  QE for the people  In response to concerns that QE is failing to create sufficient demand, particularly in the Eurozone, a number of economists have called for \\"QE for the people\\". Instead of buying government bonds or other securities by creating bank reserves, as the Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done, some suggest that central banks could make payments directly to households (in a similar fashion as Milton Friedman's helicopter money). Economists Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan argue in Foreign Affairs that this is the most effective solution for the Eurozone, particularly given the restrictions on fiscal policy. They argue that based on the evidence from tax rebates in the United States, less than 5% of GDP transferred by the ECB to the household sector in the Eurozone would suffice to generate a recovery, a fraction of what it intends to be done under standard QE. Oxford economist, John Muellbauer, has suggested that this could be legally implemented using the electoral register. On 27 March 2015, 19 economists including Steve Keen, Ann Pettifor, Robert Skidelsky, and Guy Standing have signed a letter to the Financial Times calling on the European Central Bank to adopt a more direct approach to its quantitative easing plan announced earlier in February.  Altering debt maturity structure  Based on research by economist Eric Swanson reassessing the effectiveness of the US Federal Open Market Committee action in 1961 known as Operation Twist, The Economist has posted that a similar restructuring of the supply of different types of debt would have an effect equal to that of QE. Such action would allow finance ministries (e.g., the US Department of the Treasury) a role in the process now reserved for central banks.  Neo-Fisherism  Neo-Fisherism, based on theories made by Irving Fisher reasons that the solution to low inflation is not quantitative easing, but paradoxically to increase interest rates. This is due to the fact that if interest rates continue to decline, banks will lose customers and less money will be invested back into the economy. In a situation of low inflation and high debt, customers will feel more secure holding on to cash or converting cash into commodities, which fails to stimulate economic growth. If the money supply increases from quantitative easing, customers will subsequently default in the face of higher prices, thus resetting the low inflation and worsening the low inflation issue.https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional- economist/july-2016/neo-fisherism-a-radical-idea-or-the-most-obvious-solution- to-the-low-inflation-problem Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  References   External links  * Credit Easing Policy Tools Interactive chart of the assets on Federal Reserve's balance sheet. * Deflation: Making Sure \\"It\\" Doesn't Happen Here, 2002 speech by Ben Bernanke on deflation and the utility of quantitative easing * Bank of England ‚Äì Quantitative Easing * Bank of England ‚Äì QE Explained Pamphlet * Modern Money Mechanics Federal Reserve Document Explaining How Money Is Created * Quantitative easing explained (Financial Times Europe) * A Fed Governor Discusses Quantitative Easing Among Other Topics Category:Operations of central banks Category:Financial markets Category:Inflation Category:Monetary policy ","title":"Quantitative easing"},{"id":"7235654","text":"Uldis Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈° (born May 17, 1944 in Riga) is a Latvian poet and translator.

Daniel David is also an adjunct professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and is the head of the Research Program at Albert Ellis Institute in New York. Education David was born in Satu Mare. In 1999 he obtained a Ph.D. degree in psychology from Babe»ô-Bolyai University with thesis Mecanisme incon»ôtiente de reactualizare a informa»õiilor, under the direction of Ioan Radu. National achievements David created the first school of cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) in Romania, based on international principles, recognized as such by the founders of this field such as Albert Ellis and Aaron T. Beck; he and his trainee also extended the application of CBT in education (e.g., rational-emotive & cognitive-behavioral education) and organizational fields (e.g., cognitive-behavioral coaching). He is a Fellow in the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, U.S.A. and the national representative in the Social Sciences Standing Committee at the European Science Foundation. He is among those who introduced in Romanian academic psychology the evolutionary psychology and genetic counseling as modern interdisciplinary approaches between psychology and biology. David reintroduced and up-dated the Retman concept, and is the coordinator of the team that created the comics, stories and cartoons with this character. He has promoted the reform of Romanian clinical psychology and psychotherapy based on modern principles. Such a reform was necessary, taking into account that during the communist period of Romania both clinical psychology and psychotherapy were practically forbidden by the communist regime, and thus, the field was frozen in time. For example, after the communist era, Szondi and Lusher, among other projective test, were still commonly used for clinical testing. David, who studied in the U.S.A. for both his doctoral and postdoctoral studies, was one of the leaders of the first generations of psychologists after the anti-communist revolution of 1989, as since the 2000s, he has constantly been the most cited Romanian psychologist in the international literature. Given that he had several governmental and professional positions/leadership, he marked the reform of the clinical field in Romania, helping in moving the field from a '70s style approach to the modern one.

A lieutenant in the LAPD, Decker is assisted in solving crimes by his Orthodox Jewish wife Rina Lazarus. When he meets Rina, a young widow, during an investigation at a yeshiva in The Ritual Bath, he is compelled to explore the religion for himself and eventually to become a religiously observant Orthodox Jew. Decker, though raised Baptist by his adoptive parents in Florida, discovers as an adult that his birth parents were Jewish, which makes him Jewish under traditional Jewish law as well. All the books in the series are rooted in, or at least include, Jewish themes. Aside from Peter - a name with obvious Christian origin and connotations - he has a Jewish name, Akiva - the name of a famous ancient Jewish sage. To his police colleagues, he remains \\"Peter\\", \\"Loo\\", \\"Rabbi\\" or \\"Old Man\\" but at moments of special intimacy and tenderness Rina calls him \\"Akivale\\". On the other hand, at moments of anger and confrontation his step-sons, Rina's children, sometimes call him \\"Peter\\". Major characters in the books include Rina's two sons by her late husband, Jacob and Samuel Lazarus; Cindy Decker, Peter's daughter from his first marriage; Rina and Peter's daughter Hannah Decker; and Peter's police partner Detective Marge Dunn. Decker's daughter from his first marriage, Cindy Decker, a teenager in the earliest books, eventually follows her father into the police force and is the main character of two of the later books, Stalker and Street Dreams. Decker's complicated background makes for continuing complications in his present. For example, the plot of \\"Stone Kiss\\" is launched by a call from his Jewish half-brother Jonathan - a Rabbi in New York, with whom Decker shares a biological mother but whom he met only in adulthood; but the plot later also involves his Christian step-brother Randy, a policeman like himself residing in Florida. Unsurprisingly, it is Randy - with whom he shares childhood experiences though no biological relation - that Decker feels more comfortable.

Rina, an Orthodox Jew, is the daughter of Holocaust survivors from Hungary. She married a yeshiva scholar when she was 17, lived in Israel with him for a time and had two sons. During the First Lebanon War she helped care for wounded Israeli soldiers, gaining a medical skill useful in her later American life. At that time she resided in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba in the West Bank, and - as she clearly expresses in A Stone Kiss - retained a positive attitude towards the Israeli settlers. Her husband died of a brain tumour and she went to a US college to finish her degree in mathematics. She is living and teaching at a yeshiva school when she meets her second husband, Los Angeles police sergeant (later lieutenant) Peter Decker, in The Ritual Bath. Decker, though raised a Baptist by his adoptive parents in Florida, discovered as an adult that his birth parents were Jewish, which makes him officially Jewish as well. After meeting Rina during his investigation of a rape at the yeshiva, he is compelled to explore the religion for himself and eventually to become a religiously observant Orthodox Jew. Religion is a central part of Rina's identity. Though loving Peter, she would never have married him had he not been ready to become a Jew - not only by the accident of birth, but also by a conscious decision to become a practising Orthodox Jew with all that involves. Rina strictly keeps the dress code and behaviour appropriate to a \\"frum\\" Orthodox Jewish woman. Still, there are some exceptions. In Prayers For the Dead it is revealed that, at one moment of her life, Rina had been deeply involved with Bram Sparks, a Roman Catholic priest, as deeply committed to Catholic Christianity as Rina was to Orthodox Judaism. Though probably not physically consummated (that point is left a bit ambiguous), the two of them deeply loved each other - even though such a love was clearly contradictory to the behaviour dictated by both their religions. Moreover, she retains some of her feelings for Bram even when already married to Peter - which makes Peter very jealous. All of the books that follow in the series are rooted in Jewish themes. Major characters in the series include Rina's two sons, Jacob and Samuel Lazarus; Cindy Decker, Peter's daughter from his first marriage; Rina and Peter's daughter Hannah Decker; and Peter's partner Marge Dunn. Decker's daughter from his first marriage, Cindy Decker, a teenager in the earliest books, eventually follows her father into the police force and is the main character of two of the later books, Stalker and Street Dreams.

Laurence Roth adds that Rina's relationship with the \\"assimilated American Jewish male\\", Decker, presents a \\"solution\\" to \\"the bane of American Jewish life during the 1990s\\".

Brock was a Glenelg man to the core, he has been described as, \\"....a Tiger through and through. He grew up at the Bay, worshipped the local club's football stars, then went on to be worshipped himself, one of the great players to wear the black and gold.\\" He made his league debut with the Bays in 1932, and in 1934 played in an unforgettable against-the-odds premiership, being named amongst Glenelg's best in their defeat of Port Adelaide. He was Glenelg's best and fairest player in 1935 and 1940, and won the most consistent player award four times. In 1940 he scored a runaway Magarey Medal triumph, polling 19 votes ‚Äì 5 votes clear of runner-up Max Murdy of South Adelaide. In typically humble style Brock said he \\"never entertained the thought of winning a Magarey Medal, not in my wildest dreams\\". As well as being consistent, Mel Brock was highly versatile. Much of his early football was played in the backline, but later he excelled as both a follower and a rover. He played a total of 166 games, including 3 with the West Adelaide‚ÄìGlenelg wartime pairing. He retained his passion for football for the rest of his life, coaching the reserves side in the 1950s, and was a regular spectator at Glenelg matches, both home and away. Brock died in 2000 and was survived by his wife, Dorothy, and son, Kevin.

Biography He was born of an old French family at Mondov√¨, in Piedmont, northern Italy, on 19 October, according to some 10 October, 1609. His father favoured a military career for him but, after passing some years at a nearby Jesuit college, he entered the Cistercian monastery of the Congregation of the Feuillants at Pinerolo in 1624. There, as also later at Rome, he pursued his studies with exceptional success. He laboured for fifteen years at Turin, then as prior at Asti and as abbot at Mondovi, and in 1651 was called to preside over the whole congregation as superior general. During his seven years of official life in Rome he modestly declined all further honours, refusing the Bishopric of Asti. Bona's coat of arms He welcomed the expiration of his third term, in the scholar's hope that he would be allowed to enjoy a life of retirement and study, but his intimate friend, Pope Alexander VII, wishing to honour his learning and piety, made him Consultor to the Congregation of the Index and to the Holy Office. In 1669 Clement IX, made him cardinal. There was no change in his extremely simple manner of life, and every year he donated his surplus revenue to the needy priests of the Missionary College at Rome. He died at Rome on 28 October 1674. Writings His best known ascetical works include \\"Via Compendii ad Deum\\" (1657), translated into English in 1876 by Henry Collins, O. Cist. under the title \\"An Easy Way to God\\", and \\"Principia et documenta vitae Christianae(1673), and \\"Horologium Asceticum\\" (Paris, 1676). His \\"Manuductio ad c√¶lum\\" (1658) is often compared to Thomas a Kempis's \\"Imitation of Christ\\" on account of simplicity of the style in which the solid doctrine is taught. Besides passing through fourteen Latin editions in four decades, it has been translated into Italian, French, German, Armenian and Spanish. Sir Roger L'Estrange produced an English translation (\\"The Guide to Heaven\\", 1680), later reprinted as \\"A Guide to Eternity\\" (London 1900). Shortly after his ordination he collected some of the most beautiful passages in the Church Fathers on the Mass, and later published them in a booklet, which with certain additions grew into his \\"De Sacrificio Missae\\". In addition he composed several unpublished works, known as \\"Ascetici\\", for the instruction of members of his own order. But his fame does not rest solely on the devotional writings. He was a deep student of antiquity, and so successful in treating of the use of the Psalter in the Christian Church (\\"De Divin√¢ Psalmodi√¢\\", Paris, 1663) that Cardinal Pallavicini urged him to undertake the history of the Mass. Realizing the magnitude of the task, he at first declined, but finally set to work and after more than seven years' labour brought out his famous work: \\"De Rebus Liturgicis\\" (Rome, 1671), a veritable encyclopedia of historic information on all subjects bearing on the Mass, such as rites, churches, vestments and so on. The first of many editions of his complete works was published at Antwerp in 1677. References Sources  Pius Maurer: Kardinal Giovanni Bona.

Founded in 1972, it is based in Pau (d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques) but also in Anglet, Bayonne, Tarbes and Mont-de-Marsan in the Adour river basin. Coming administratively under the Academy of Bordeaux, it is the third largest university in southwestern France (after Bordeaux and Toulouse), with some 12,000 students. The University's logo is a stylised representation of the Pyr√©n√©es or the Pic du Midi d'Ossau, the blue triangle being the Atlantic ocean. The colors used (yellow, green blue) are those of the university's graphic charter. History The university was founded in 1970, in a splendid formerly urban park. However, the origins of the Law faculty ('UFR de Droit, Economie et Gestion') go further back; it was created in 1947 by Robert Poplawski (dean from 1947 to 1953) and Dean Vizioz, and was lodged in Villa Lawrence in Pau town centre. Villa Lawrence The university was led by the following presidents: Pau campus Pr√©sidence building diagram Pr√©sidence building viewed from a South-West position (parking sud) With nearly 9,000 students, the Pau campus is the largest. The President's office is located there in the Pr√©sidence (Presidency) semicircular building. The campus is located to the north of Pau, about twenty minutes ride from the town centre, but within the urban limits. The campus is comprised in the space between Avenue de l'Universit√©-Cours L√©on B√©rard-Boulevard Tourasse to the South, Avenue du Doyen Poplawski to the West, rue Audrey Benghozi and Boulevard Lucien Favre to the North and All√©es Condorcet to the East.

Withdrawal of University On 16 October 1914, three weeks after the end of the 1914 season, the University Football Club dropped out of the VFL and folded. The reasons given for this decision were: * Firstly, after three promising seasons in 1908‚Äì1910, University had become very uncompetitive, finishing last in 1911‚Äì1914, and losing its last 51 consecutive matches. * Secondly, since the players' primary focus was on their studies rather than football, particularly during mid-year examinations, the club found it difficult to maintain a constant lineup. * Thirdly, since University's admission to the VFL in 1908, player payments in the VFL had become commonplace and were officially permitted from 1911, whereas University chose to remain a fully amateur club drawing solely from university students, which had caused a number of players to defect to other clubs. As such, both the club and the VFL had realised it would be virtually impossible for University to become viable and/or competitive in an increasingly professional competition. Despite the outbreak of World War I eleven weeks earlier, the war was not given as a contributing factor in University's decision, especially as the conflict was not, at the time, expected to escalate to the extent it did. Following University's dissolution, players who wished to continue playing in the VFL were all cleared to through an informal arrangement beneficial to both clubs:University (1908-1914), Demonwiki. University wished to see its best players playing together in the same VFL club to retain the strength of its own team for intervarsity competition, and Melbourne, which had mostly struggled since its 1900 premiership due to the lack of a natural recruiting district (formal zoning was not introduced until the following year), gained exclusive access to a valuable source of recruits. Among those who transferred from University to Melbourne were Jack Brake, Claude Bryan, Jack Doubleday, Dick Gibbs, Roy Park, and Percy Rodriguez.Melbourne: University Stars Join, The (Melbourne) Herald, (Friday, 16 April 1915), p.3.Migration of Players, The (Melbourne) Winner, (Wednesday, 21 April 1915), p.6. With the VFL being reduced to nine clubs, a bye was required in the fixture for the first time in the league's history. The University club reformed in 1919, and continues to play amateur football in the Victorian Amateur Football Association to this day. Premiership season In 1915, the VFL competition consisted of nine teams of 18 on-the- field players each, with no \\"reserves\\", although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match. Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 18 rounds (i.e., 16 matches and 2 byes). Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1915 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended \\"Argus system\\".

Awards * The 1915 VFL Premiership team was Carlton. * The VFL's leading goalkicker were Dick Lee of Collingwood and Jimmy Freake of Fitzroy with 66 goals each. * Geelong took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1915. Notable events * Prior to the season, VFL delegates voted in favour of rule changes to bring the game closer to a hybridisation of Australian rules football and rugby league: specifically the addition of a crossbar to the goal posts over which goals were to be kicked, disallowing forward handpasses, and rules to allow stronger rugby-style tackling between the shoulders and the hips. The rules could not come into immediate effect as they required approval at a vote of Australasian Football Council delegates, and this vote never took place due to the war, so none of these changes were ever implemented. * The first round of the 1915 was played on Saturday 24 April 1915, one day before the forces of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps landed at ANZAC Cove in their first hostile action in World War I. * St Kilda changed its traditional colours of red, white, and black, the colours of the enemy (the German Empire) to red, yellow, and black, the colours of a trusted ally (The Kingdom of Belgium).\\"ST. KILDA: BELGIAN COLORS WORN, When the umpire's whistle calls the St. Kllda team to arms against South Melbourne [next Saturday] they will be in the full bloom of new colors ‚Äî something like the gorgeous dahlias in the Alexandra Gardens. The public will cheer them as footballers, but probably the cheering will be more hearty because the colors are those of the brave and suffering Belgians ‚Äî scarlet, yellow and black. Tho club decided last year to cast aside the old colors, which were those of tho German ruffians, pirates and baby-killers.\\" (The Herald, (Friday, 16 April 1915), p.3.) * On 12 March 1915, responding to intense public pressure, a motion was put to a VFL meeting (proposed by the Geelong delegate, seconded by the Melbourne delegate) to suspend the VFL competition for the entire season (in March 1915, nobody expected the war to last for as long as it did). The votes were Geelong, Melbourne, Essendon, St Kilda, and South Melbourne \\"for\\", and the inner-Melbourne clubs of Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Richmond \\"against\\". In the absence of the required three-quarters majority, the motion was lost. * At the instigation of the SAFL, interstate matches were suspended. * At 2:00PM on Saturday 29 May 1915, Essendon centreman and 1914 Victorian State wingman, Cyril Gove, rode the racehorse Menthe into third place in the Springbank Corinthian Handicap. a race for amateur riders,Goodwood, \\"Notes and Chat\\", The Argus, (Saturday, 29 May 1915), p.22, col.A. at Moonee Valley Racecourse.

It is also commonly called the small-headed toadlet, red-groined toadlet or the chubby gungan. Description Thigh colouration of the Wrinkled Toadlet The wrinkled toadlet is a small frog, which varies largely in size. It is smaller on the coast of eastern Australia, and larger inland, ranging from . The dorsal surface is warty, and grey to brown, with dark markings. The ventral surface is smooth and grey. The parotoid glands and inguinal glands are large in comparison to the size of the frog, and yellowish in colour. Behind each knee, and in the groin are bright orange. The tadpoles hatch mostly black, with a distinct gold patch behind each eye. As development continues, the gold pigment spreads, until the tadpole is mottled grey and gold. The wrinkled toadlet has mostly unwebbed hands and feet, and the tympanum is not visible. Ecology and behavior The wrinkled toadlet inhabits subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland and forests, and intermittent freshwater marshes. The males call from within flooded grasslands any time of the year, except winter. The male's call is a high pitched click. Amplexus takes place within the flooded grassland. The male fertilizes each egg individually. The female then dives under water and attaches it to a submerged object. Each egg is attached to a different object.

The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of shastra and \\"see\\" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulatsya, and Vashishtha. In other manvantara there are other saptarishi. In the present manvantara the seven are Kashyapa, Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja. To the Rishi the Vedas were revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The three chief classes of rishi are the Brahmarshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the Devarshi of lower rank, and Rajarshi or Kings who became rishi through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka, Ritaparna, etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as Jaimini. Rakshasas and Kinnaras are children of Pulastya, according to Mahabharata. In Puranic literature He was the medium through which some of the Puranas were communicated to the mankind. He received the Vishnu Purana from Brahma and communicated it to Parashara, who made it known to mankind. He was father of Vishrava and the great Rishi, Agastya. Vishrava Muni was the father of Kubera and Ravana, and all the Yaksha are supposed to have sprung from him. Pulastya was married to one of Rishi Kardam's nine daughters named Havirbhoo. Pulastya Rishi had son Vishrava who in turn had two wives: one was Kaikesi who gave birth to Ravana, Shurpanakha, Kumbhakarna, and Vibhishana; and another was Ilavida and had a son named Kubera.  In Ramakien  In Thai National epic Ramakien, Pulastya is call Latsatian. He was the second king of Lanka and the father of Thotsakan.  Archaeology  Certain sources claim that the famous granite statue of a king in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, which was first thought to be of King Parakramabahu the Great, might actually be the Pulastya Rishi. This idea was later proven to be false by Prof. Senarath Paranawithana. Apart from this, no other statues, carvings, paintings or friezes of Pulastya Rishi have been found on the island.(Sri Lanka) King Parakramabahu the great.jpg|The historical statue in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka which is meant to be of Pulatsya sage.

Throughout its existence, RAF Filton shared the airfield with the Bristol Aeroplane Company (later British Aircraft Corporation) whose works, now owned by BAE/Airbus, are situated on the south side of the main runway. History First World War The first squadron to form at the airfield during the First World War was No. 33 Squadron RFC which formed during January 1916 and was composed of elements of No. 20 Squadron RFC which flew the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2. The next squadron was 42 Squadron which moved to Filton during April 1916 from crews of 19 Squadron and again flew the B.E.2. Then No. 66 (Fighter) Squadron was formed in June 1916 with Sopwith Pup biplanes before the squadron moved on to France in March 1917. The squadron was joined by 62 Squadron in August 1916 when the squadron was formed from elements of No. 7 Training Squadron which were equipped with the Bristol F.2 Fighter from May 1917. Between the wars No. 101 Squadron RAF was disbanded at Filton following its return from France in March 1919 where it had flown the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 as a night bomber squadron. In June 1929 No. 501 (Special Reserve) Squadron RAF was formed at Filton as a day bomber squadron flying Airco DH.9A biplanes. Initially named 'City of Bristol' it was renamed 'County of Gloucester' Squadron in May 1930. It became part of the Auxiliary Air Force in 1936. The Squadron flew Hawker Harts and then the Hawker Hind light bomber from 1938. Second World War During the Second World War it was home to the Filton Sector Operations Room which was part of No. 10 Group RAF of RAF Fighter Command. The first unit to use the airfield was No. 935 (County of Glamorgan) Barrage Balloon Unit (Auxiliary Air Force), which was at Filton from January 1939 with 2 Flights of 8 barrage balloons, and responsible for the defence of the Naval Yard at Plymouth as well as the airfield at Filton. The unit's allocation was increased to 24 Balloons during August 1940 as RAF Filton did not have a defensive fighter squadron attached to defend the airfield. No. 11 Balloon Centre at RAF Pucklechurch, north of Bristol, also came under the command of the RAF Filton station commander. Squadrons stationed at RAF Filton from the beginning of the Second World War included 501 (County of Gloucester) Sqdn (Auxiliary Air Force), now flying Hawker Hurricane Ic fighters, until 10 May 1940 when the Squadron moved to France; and 263 Squadron (reformed on 2 October 1939 at Filton) taking over some of the Gloster Gladiator I biplane fighters previously with No. 605 Squadron RAF and still wearing that squadron's code letter (HE). The Squadron went on to Norway in April 1940 operating from a frozen lake. Between May and June 1940, No. 236 Squadron was based at Filton with Bristol Blenheim twin- engined fighters, flying defensive sweeps over the Channel. In February 1941 No. 118 Squadron RAF was reformed at Filton flying Supermarine Spitfire Is until April 1941. Also in February 1941, Bristol University Air Squadron (UAS) was formed at Filton as part of 54 Group (along with Birmingham UAS). Initially flying the de Havilland Moth and later de Havilland Tiger Moth and North American Harvard trainers. It continued at Filton until it was disbanded in 1946. No. 528 Squadron RAF was formed at Filton in June 1943, flying the Bristol Blenheim and de Havilland Hornet Moth in the radar calibration role. During the Second World War the Station Warrant Officer at Filton was Alec (Tubby) Kerr. Described in the Bristol Evening World in 1957 as one of the best-known Station Warrant Officers the RAF has ever known. SWO Kerr was awarded the MBE on 13 June 1946. The Filton 'Blitz' The airfield was attacked on 25 September 1940 just before mid-day by 58 Heinkel 111 bombers with Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter escort. The Luftwaffe raid was primarily aimed at the Bristol Aeroplane Company's works on the south side of the airfield. One of the air raid shelters on the airfield received a direct hit, five others seriously damaged and during the raid over 200 people were killed. Luftwaffe reconnaissance planes had determined that there were no fighter aircraft stationed at Filton prior to the attack but No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron RAF (Auxiliary Air Force) was moved in from 26 September 1940, flying Hawker Hurricane Mk1 fighters, as a result of this raid. Post war years Camouflaged Vickers Valiant at Filton. Date uncertain but probably the mid-1960s An Avro Vulcan B1A V bomber parked on one of the four rapid dispersal points at Filton during a public air display in the 1960s After the war years Filton again became home to No. 501 Squadron RAF, which was reformed in May 1946 as a Royal Auxiliary Air Force day-fighter squadron equipped with Spitfire XVI (LF)s. These were followed in 1948 by de Havilland Vampire F1s, and the FB5 from Spring 1951. 501 Squadron continued at Filton until it was disbanded in March 1957, when the remaining Royal Auxiliary Air Force flying units were stood down. Filton was also once again home to the Bristol University Air Squadron as part of 62 Group. Initially flying de Havilland Tiger Moth T2s, these were replaced with de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk T10 trainers; and also No. 3 Air Experience Flight RAFVR which was formed on 8 September 1958, also with de Havilland Chipmunk trainers. Operating out of Filton from 1948 was No. 12 Reserve Flying School (RFS) equipped with six de Havilland Tiger Moths for RAF Reserve Pilot training and (from 1949) initially two (later three) Avro Ansons for Navigator training. This school was operated under special contract to the Air Ministry by the Bristol Aeroplane Company as part of the Volunteer Reserve Pilot training scheme. This continued until March 1953 when No. 12 RFS closed. In the 1950s and early '60s, Filton was designated as a V bomber dispersal base. During the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) Avro Vulcan V bombers were at Filton and kept at 'immediate readiness' status with engines idling. Current use The airfield is now closed and the only aircraft operating are NPAS (Western Counties Air Operations Unit) Police helicopter & The Great Western Air Ambulance Charity. In 2017, part of the former RAF Filton site became home to Aerospace Bristol, an aerospace museum run by the Bristol Aero Collection Trust. A varied collection of exhibits is housed in the former RAF hangars [now Grade 2 listed]. The exhibition covers over 100 years of aviation history with emphasis on items relating to Filton, including Concorde 216, the final Concorde to be built and the last to fly, in a newly built structure.

The island is within the locality of Ugar Island within the local government area of the Torres Strait Island Region.  Geography  The island is located near the Great Barrier Reef and north of Coconut Island (also called Poruma) and northwest of Murray Island and west of Darnley Island. Islanders The Torres Islander people of the island are of Melanesian origin and hold close kinship ties with the Islander people of Darnley Island (Erub) and Murray Island (Mer). The Traditional Owners of Stephen Island call themselves the Ugarem-Le.Stephen on behalf of the Ugar People v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 1574 The Ugarem-Le lived in village communities following traditional patterns of hunting, fishing, agriculture and trade for many thousands of years before contact was made with European visitors to the region.R E Johannes & J W MacFarlane, Traditional Fishing in the Torres Strait Islands(CSIRO; 1991) 97-100, 107-108. The people of Stephen Island call themselves Ugarem Le, and are the same people as the neighbouring Erubam Le of Erub (Darnley Island), the Meriam Le and Nog Le of Mer (Murray), the Dauarab Le of Dauar and the people of Waier. The traditional language of these islands is Meriam M√¨r, of which there were formerly two dialects, Erub-Ugar and Mer-Dauar-Waier. Etymology The island's European name was bestowed by Captain William Bligh in 1792 during his second breadfruit voyage to the Pacific, after Philip Stephens, First Secretary to the Admiralty.  History of Stephen Island   European contact  In September 1792, Captain William Bligh, in charge of the British Navy ships Providence and Assistant, visited Torres Strait and mapped the main reefs and channels. Bligh gave Stephen Island its name. In 1793, the merchant vessel Shah Hormuzear and the whaler anchored off Darnley Island. A party of 6 sailors were killed by the Islanders when they were discovered polluting Darnley Island‚Äôs only supply of fresh water. In retaliation the Captains Alt and Bampton ordered the destruction of huts, canoes and gardens on Darnley Island and several Islanders were killed. Captains Alt and Bampton next travelled to Stephen Island in search of a boat which went missing during the attack. The Ugarem-Le shot arrows at the sailors when they landed on the Island. The crew returned with gunfire and set fire to a village on Stephen Island.S Mullins, Torres Strait A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994) 18-20J Singe, The Torres Strait, People and History (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia; 1979) 23-25R Ganter, The Pearl Shellers of Torres Strait(Melbourne University Press, Melbourne; 1994) 37. In the early 1860s, beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) and pearling boats began working the reefs of Torres Strait. In June 1879, the Queensland Coast Islands Act 1879 was passed by the Queensland Government, allowing it to claim all Torres Strait islands including Stephen Island, beyond the previous 60 mile limit. This Act enabled the Queensland Government to control and regulate the beche-de-mer and pearling industries, which previously had operated outside its jurisdiction.S Mullins, Torres Strait A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994), 139-161. A beche-de-mer station was established on Stephen Island in the 1880s by a man named Wilson.S Mullins, Torres Strait A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994), 169. Torres Strait Islanders refer to the arrival of London Missionary Society (LMS) missionaries at Erub in July 1871 as \\"the Coming of the Light\\". Around 1900, the LMS missionary Rev. Walker established a philanthropic business scheme named Papuan Industries Limited (PIL). PIL encouraged Islander communities to co-operatively rent or purchase their own pearl luggers or \\"company boats\\". The \\"company boats\\" were used to harvest pearl shells and beche-de-mer, which was sold and distributed by PIL. The people of Stephen Island made arrangements to purchase their first company boat in 1905. Company boats provided Islanders with income and a sense of community pride and also improved transport and communication between the islands.R Ganter, The Pearl Shellers of Torres Strait(Melbourne University Press, Melbourne; 1994) pp 68-75Queensland, Annual Report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals for 1905 (1906) 29N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993) pp 158-161. In November 1912, 800 acres of land on Stephen Island were officially gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve by the Queensland Government. Many other Torres Strait Islands were gazetted as Aboriginal reserves at the same time.Queensland, Queensland Government Gazette, vol.99, no.138 (1912) 1330. By 1918, a Protector of Aboriginals had been appointed to Thursday Island and during the 1920s and 1930s racial legislation was strictly applied to Torres Strait Islanders, enabling the government to remove Islanders to reserves and missions across Queensland. A government school was built on Stephen Island in 1925.Queensland, Annual Report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals for 1925(1926) 7. In 1936, around 70% of the Torres Strait Islander workforce went on strike, in the first organised challenge against government authority made by Torres Strait Islanders. The 9-month strike was an expression of Islanders‚Äô anger and resentment at increasing government control of their livelihoods. The strike protested against government interference in wages, trade and commerce and also called for the lifting of evening curfews, the removal of the permit system for inter-island travel, and the recognition of the Islanders‚Äô right to recruit their own boat crews.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993) pp181-186, 278J. Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), p.54 The strike produced a number of significant reforms and innovations. Unpopular local Protector J.D. McLean was removed and replaced by Cornelius O‚ÄôLeary. O‚ÄôLeary established a system of regular consultations with elected Islander council representatives. The new councils were given a degree of autonomy including control over local island police and courts.J. Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), pp54-55. On 23 August 1937 O‚ÄôLeary convened the first Inter Islander Councillors Conference at Yorke Island. Representatives from 14 Torres Strait communities attended. Ned Oroki represented Stephen Island at the conference. After lengthy discussions, unpopular bylaws (including the evening curfews) were cancelled, and a new code of local representation was agreed upon.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993) pp 210-214Queensland, State Archives, A/3941 Minutes of Torres Strait Councillors Conference held at Yorke Island 23‚Äì25 August 1937. In 1939, the Queensland Government passed the Torres Strait Islander Act 1939, which incorporated many of the recommendations discussed at the conference. A key section of the new act officially recognised Torres Strait Islanders as a separate people from Aboriginal Australians.Sections 3 (a) ‚Äì (c) of the Torres Strait Islander Act (Qld) 1939.

During World War Two in 1941, the Australian Government began recruiting Torres Strait Islander men to serve in the armed forces. Recruited men from Stephen Island and other island communities formed the Torres Strait Light Infantry. While the Torres Strait Islander recruits were respected as soldiers, they only received one third of the pay given to white Australian servicemen. On 31 December 1943, a number of companies of the Torres Strait Light Infantry went on strike calling for equal pay and equal rights for all soldiers. The Australian military hierarchy agreed to increase their pay to two thirds the level received by white servicemen. Full back pay was offered in compensation to the Torres Strait servicemen by the Australian Government in the 1980s.J. Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), pp64-65 After gaining its independence from Australia in 1975, Papua New Guinea asserted its right to the islands and waters of the Torres Straits. In December 1978, a treaty was signed by the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments that described the boundaries between the 2 countries and the use of the sea area by both parties.For further information see: Australia, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: www.dfat.gov.au/geo/torres_strait/index.html#briefN Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993) pp 226-227. The Torres Strait Treaty, which has operated since February 1985, contains special provision for free movement (without passports or visas) between both countries.Under Art. 11. Free movement between communities applies to traditional activities such as fishing, trading and family gatherings, which occur in a specifically created Protected Zone and nearby areas.See also Art 12. The Protected Zone also assists in the preservation and protection of the land, sea, air and native plant and animal life of the Torres Strait.Further information about the Protected Zone can be found at: www.pzja.gov.au.  Local government and Deed of Grant communities  On 30 March 1985, the Stephen Island community elected 3 councillors to constitute an autonomous Stephen Island Council established under the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. This Act conferred local government type powers and responsibilities upon Torres Strait Islander councils for the first time. The Aboriginal reserve on the island, held by the Queensland Government, was transferred on 21 October 1985 to the trusteeship of the council under a Deed of Grant in Trust.Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1986(1987) 3; Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1987 (1988) 29. On 24 April 2002 the council‚Äôs name was changed from Stephen Island Council to Ugar Island Council. In 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission recommended that the 15 Torres Strait Island councils be abolished and the Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) be established in their place. In elections conducted under the Local Government Act 1993 on 15 March 2008, members of the 15 communities comprising the TSIRC local government area each voted for a local councillor and a mayor to constitute a council consisting of 15 councillors plus a mayor.

She later lived in Stonehouse in a cottage named \\"Elscot\\".  Political ideas  He recognised that there would be increased competition for resources and markets as productivity rose and that this would impact upon people's lives both by taking resources away from good causes, such as health and the advancement of science and by the effects of war: In \\"post-war conditions of politics and trade... trade ... must find a vent in export for the huge increase of capacity in the productive machinery of this and other countries, leading to fiercer and fiercer competition for foreign markets and for 'control' of the raw material producing regions ‚Äì particularly coal and oil areas ‚Äì and so to another large scale war beside which the last will pale into insignificance, a war possibly with America, as part of the price I have to pay for the goods I buy under the present system. Many other items I have also entered up which do not commonly figure in a manufacturer's cost accounts, although they must inevitably be paid for all the same-neglect of science, neglect of health, neglect indeed of all that might to-day make life fair and gracious, simply because industry is run from the point of view of 'frenzied finance' and not for the service of mankind. . . . .\\" The Price We Payhttp://dl.lib.brown.edu/pdfs/1140814894764238.pdf He felt that in the 1920s political change was around the corner, in particular to the left: \\"Nevertheless, in spite of all my doubts there are times when I am upon the whole more hopeful of the world ridding itself of its innumerable burdens; when I see signs of more and yet more fires being kindled in the minds of men; smouldering as yet, but soon it may be to blaze up and spread the knowledge that a time of great change is at hand.\\" He recognised the danger posed by Hitler to Eastern Europe at the end of the 1930s. In \\"Ukraine and its People\\" (1939), he wrote \\"There is good reason to believe that Herr Hitler proposes to make use of (Ukrainian minority movements) to serve his own ambitions. The nature of these ambitions, which include the annexation of Soviet Ukraine, is indicated in Mein Kampf\\". It is interesting that whilst being a Communist, Hugh Vowles' first wife was a shareholder in her family's milling company in Gloucester, England. The company, Priday, Metford and Company Limited, was, however, family-owned for five generations and renowned for retaining many staff members for over fifty years. In a brief account of his life left in about 1990 by his daughter in law Elizabeth Langhorne, she states: \\"HPV was an engineer, socialist and journalist. He also moved to Gloucester and worked as a left wing journalist trying to promote peaceful relations with the Soviet Union. Conservatives still run when they see a Vowles in their territory\\".  Religious ideas  Hugh Pembroke Vowles at the Oxlynch His religious ideas are particularly interesting given that he was the son of a Wesleyan Minister and became a communist in an era when socialism was popular amongst western intellectuals. He discussed Christianity in the context of socialism in his article entitled \\"Tradition in the Great State\\" in the book Socialism and the Great State edited by H.G. Wells and published in 1912. This book outlined how a state run along ideal socialist lines would be like. He stated the following: \\"Many of the needs of men are long-lived, and it is an open question whether most if not all of our present-day traditions will not go on to a fuller and completer influence in the lives of the citizens of the Great State. That large body of tradition we speak of as Christianity, for example, may conceivably serve as the basis of the moral tradition in the Great State. This matter is, I believe, to be discussed more fully in another paper in this book, but the present writer now ventures to offer a few remarks that seem to fall within his scope. In many ways he admits Christian tradition has been a beneficial factor in our evolution. Its teaching of love and concord is of the very essence of the Great State. Whatever broadens the basis of sympathy and mutual understanding is a force operating in the constructive direction, and so it would seem probable that Christianity will at least survive in its spirit and intermingle with the more elaborate traditions of the future. In no case can a tradition disappear without leaving behind it some effect or influence. But this is far from asserting that there need be or will be a definite survival of Christianity as such. Contemporary Christianity must purge itself from a multitude of defects before it can possibly be acceptable to the clear-headed men who will be the normal citizens of the Great State. A mere spirit of co-operation alone can never be all sufficing for the religious basis of tradition. The Great State will be complex beyond all precedent and that he may cope successfully with these complexities the average citizen must be trained to think clearly and exhaustively, and be given a wealth of tradition for his guidance multifarious beyond any the world has yet produced. Christianity as we know it at present makes no insistence upon understanding and mental alertness as duties, nor upon the supreme necessity of thoroughness in thought and work. It is not a critical religion; it is emotionally sound, perhaps, but critically careless, and the vital preservative of right in a complex situation is a critical faculty highly stimulated and fed.\\" It is not known if his perspective on religion changed later in his life.  Collaboration with others  Vowles collaborated with H.G. Wells and Professor Sir E.Ray Lankester. He was a close friend of Hubert Cecil Booth, inventor of the vacuum cleaner. Booth married Margaret Vowles' sister.

The company is best known for the development of NetObjects Fusion, a web design application for small and medium enterprises with designers who need complete control over page layout and a similar user interface as desktop publishing applications. In its first phase, NetObjects was based in Redwood City, California, and ceased operations in 2001 after selling its assets to Website Pros (now Web.com) and a portfolio of patents to Macromedia. In 2009 NetObjects was re-established as an independent software company.  History  Beginnings From 1992 to 1995 the founders of NetObjects had worked at Rae Technology and before that in part at Apple Computer investigating proto-types of web browsers, information navigation and web design tools. In 1995 NetObjects was founded to market NetObjects Fusion, a new design tool to build web sites. The term \\"web site\\", well-known and widespread today, was created by the work of Samir Arora, David Kleinberg, Clement Mok and Sal Arora. and they were awarded the first web site builder patent as inventors. Initially NetObjects was as a privately held company with the Series A venture investment led by Rae Technology, Series B by Norwest Venture Partners and Venrock Associates, followed by Novell, Mitsubishi and AT&T; Ventures and the last round by Perseus Capital, L.L.C. In April 1997 IBM invested $100 million to acquire a majority of the company. The deal had a valuation of $150 million.  Launch of NetObjects Fusion and IPO  NetObjects Fusion 1.0 was released in 1996. As the first complete web design tool it was seen as groundbreaking by technology observers. NetObjects was elected as one of \\"25 Cool Technology Companies\\" of 1996 by Fortune. Also in 1996, NetObjects Fusion won PC Magazine's Editors' Choice award. CNET's Builder.com elected Samir Arora one of the Web Innovators of 1997, and in 1998 NetObjects received the prestigious Gold award from the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). Eleven U.S. patents were granted for Internet- related technologies (design and utility). Releases 2.0 (1997) and 3.0 (1998) of NetObjects Fusion again gained positive reactions by the PC press as well as commercial success on the market. In 1999 IBM brought NetObjects to the stock exchange with initial public offering while remaining the major shareholder. The initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ raised $72 million. The board of directors consisted of six people: Samir Arora as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, and five directors including John Sculley from Apple Computer, three representatives from IBM and one from Novell.  Success on the market and the stock exchange  In the following years numerous product-bundling deals were made with nearly all the big PC sellers like Dell and HP, and with Internet service providers like UUNET, Earthlink or 1 & 1 (Germany). The company itself said it licensed the distribution of more than 15 million copies of NetObjects Fusion. In 2000 the stock price of NETO (ticker symbol) reached its record high of $45 11/16 USD, making NetObjects worth $1.5 billion. Revenue had started at $7.2 million in 1997, reached $15 million in 1998, $23.2 million in 1999 and peaked at $34.2 million for fiscal year 2000 (October 1999 - September 2000). On March 3, 2000, TheStreet.com's Adam Lashinsky praised NetObject's financial performance and its early adoption of e-business: > \\"And, more so than many start-ups, NetObjects has managed to deliver on what > it has promised. It has slightly beaten the expectations of the friendly > analysts who follow it. And quarter by quarter, it has steadily reduced its > operating losses. Plus, it got lucky. It was firmly entrenched as a > business-to-business software company before the term gained currency and > B2B companies took off.\\"  Shift in strategy  In 1998 the company had developed and since then distributed NetObjects Authoring Suite and the related \\"Collage\\" product, which as content management solutions were aimed at big businesses and ranged at much higher price levels than NetObjects Fusion. However, IBM and NetObjects decided that its target market was the sector of small and medium enterprises, so it would focus on its flagship application NetObjects Fusion which would fit within the scope of these customers. In the beginnings of the concept of \\"software as a service\\" (SaaS), the company secondly made a bet on its ability to recognize technological trends and coined a strategy shift to a subscription model. To this end NetObjects Matrix was developed and GoBizGo.com, an e-commerce solution was started. Subscribing web and online services would help small businesses keep pace with the Internet. To finance this shift of strategy, the NetObjects Enterprise Division with 40 employees along with two applications, Collage and NetObjects Authoring Suite, was sold for $18 million to UK-based Merant (merged in 2004 with Serena Software Inc., based in San Mateo, California). High hopes were based on the NetObjects Matrix platform and its possibilities to position NetObjects as a \\"Business Service Provider\\". A version for Mac was announced, and a cooperation with IBM Global Services was forged.  Challenges and crisis  However, several factors led NetObjects to a crisis starting in 2000. Tough competition from Microsoft, Macromedia and Adobe put pressure on market share and falling prices of web-design applications affected revenues. Also, long-term revenue effects of bundling deals in the software industry are controversial. NetObjects slashed prices for NetObjects Fusion from release 1.0 to release 4.0 by more than 50%. Older versions stayed in distribution for even lower prices. Technical demands for large business web sites changed and required direct access of programmers to HTML code ‚Äî which NetObjects Fusion was not designed for. Its target market were designers who need complete control over page layout and a similar user interface as desktop publishing applications.  IBM decisions and sale of NetObjects  In 2001 revenue decreased sharply, a result of changing markets, price cuts, strategy shift to Software as a Service. Subscription fees from NetObjects Matrix started coming in but the company faced losses: total revenues for the first three quarters of FY 2001 were $4.22 million, whilst costs were $7.67 million. NetObjects started a raise of an additional $50 million in a private placement with Deutsche Bank, the cash reserves which was not approved by IBM's NetObjects Board. In the summer of 2001, the markets plummeted with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. And ultimately IBM as the majority shareholder decided to sell NetObjects. NetObjects Fusion, NetObjects Matrix including the MatrixBuilder, BizGoBiz and other assets were sold to Website Pros (now Web.com), a web design and services company based in Jacksonville, Florida Additionally a portfolio of seven patents was sold to Macromedia (now Adobe), the distributor of Dreamweaver, the long-term main competitor of NetObjects Fusion.  NetObjects as a division of Website Pros  Website Pros (WSP) (now Web.com) went on developing and distributing future versions of NetObjects Fusion and offering subscription services based on this application, representing the mixed business model that was invented at NetObjects. License revenue from sales of NetObjects Fusion reached nearly $3.58 million in 2006, $2.4 million in 2007, and $2.5 million in 2008. In May 2009 NetObjects Fusion was sold.  NetObjects as a re-established company  In May 2009 NetObjects Inc. was re- established as an independent company. It acquired the NetObjects Fusion product line from Web.com. A smaller part of the amount was transferred instantly, while $3.0 million remained payable from future revenue of NetObjects Fusion sales until 2013. In terms of management and staff, there are no overlapping between the old and new companies with the same name. Steve Raubenstine, who was vice president of the NetObjects Fusion division at Web.com (former Website Pros), serves as President and CEO of the new NetObjects Inc.  Products  * NetObjects Fusion: web design tool created in 1996, sold to Website Pros (now Web.com) in 2001, re-purchased by the new established NetObjects, Inc. in 2009, still distributed.

Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular stimulation (IMS). It involves the use of either solid filiform needleshttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV- partA-sec360j.pdf or hollow-core hypodermic needles for therapy of muscle pain, including pain related to myofascial pain syndrome. Dry needling is mainly used to \\"treat\\" myofascial \\"trigger points\\", but it is also used to \\"target\\" connective tissue, neural ailments, and muscular ailments. The American Physical Therapy Association defines dry needling as a technique used to treat dysfunction of skeletal muscle and connective tissue, minimize peripheral nociception (pain), and improve or regulate structural or functional damage. The efficacy of dry needling as a treatment for muscle pain is still not ascertained and there remains no scientific consensus whether it is effective. Some results suggest that it is an effective treatment for certain kinds of muscle pain, while other studies have shown no benefit compared to a placebo. Currently, dry needling is being practiced in the United States, Europe, Australia, and other countries; however, not enough high-quality, long-term, and large-scale studies have been done on the technique to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy.  Origin  The origin of the term \\"dry needling\\" is attributed to Janet G. Travell. In her 1983 book, Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual, Travell uses the term \\"dry needling\\" to differentiate between two hypodermic needle techniques when performing trigger point therapy. However, Travell did not elaborate on the details on the techniques of dry needling; the current techniques of dry needling were based on the traditional and western medical acupuncture. The two techniques Travell described are the injection of a local anesthetic and the mechanical use of a hypodermic needle without injecting a solution. Travell preferred a 22-gauge, 1.5-in hypodermic needle for trigger point therapy and used this needle for both injection therapy and dry needling. Travell never used an acupuncture needle. Travell had access to acupuncture needles but reasoned that they were far too thin for trigger point therapy. She preferred hypodermic needles because of their strength and tactile feedback: \\"A 22-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is usually suitable for most superficial muscles. In hyperalgesic patients, a 25-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle may cause less discomfort, but will not provide the clear \\"feel\\" of the structures being penetrated by the needle and is more likely to be deflected by the dense contraction knots that are the target... A 27-gauge needle, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is even more flexible; the tip is more likely to be deflected by the contraction knots and it provides less tactile feedback for precision injection\\". Although dry needling originally utilized only hypodermic needles due to the concern that solid needles had neither the strength or tactile feedback that hypodermic needles provided and that the needle could be deflected by \\"dense contraction knots\\", those concerns have proven unfounded and many healthcare practitioners who perform dry needling have found that the acupuncture needles not only provides better tactile feedback but also penetrate the \\"dense muscle knots\\" better and are easier to manage and caused less discomfort to patients. For that reason, both the use of hypodermic needles and the use of acupuncture needles are now accepted in dry needling practices. Ofttimes practitioners who use hypodermic needles also provide trigger point injection treatment to patients and therefore find the use of hypodermic needles a better choice. As their use became more common, some dry needling practitioners without acupuncture in their scope of practice, started to refer to these needles by their technical design term as \\"solid filiform needles\\" as opposed to the FDA designation \\"acupuncture needle.\\" The \\"solid filiform needle\\" used in dry needling is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device described in the code titled \\"Sec. 880.5580 Acupuncture needle\\" as \\"a device intended to pierce the skin in the practice of acupuncture\\". Per the Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the subsequent amendments to said act, the FDA definition applies to how the needles can be marketed and does not mean that acupuncture is the only medical procedure where these needles can be used. Dry needling using such a needle contrasts with the use of a hollow hypodermic needle to inject substances such as saline solution, botox or corticosteroids to the same point. The Founder of Integrative Systemic Dry Needling (ISDN), Yun-Tao Ma, has been spearheading the \\"dry needling\\" movement in the United States. Ma states, \\"Although ISDN originated in traditional Chinese methods, it has developed from the ancient empirical approach to become modern medical art rooted in evidence-based thinking and practice.\\" Ma then contradicts himself stating, \\"Dry needling technique is a modern Western medical modality that is not related to traditional Chinese acupuncture in any way. Dry needling has its own theoretical concepts, terminology, needling technique and clinical application.\\" Ma realizing both the self-contradictions and the legal ramifications of dry needling being rooted in acupuncture and Chinese medicine has since taken down all information in his bios regarding his education in Chinese Medicine and being a Licensed Acupuncturist in the United States. The American Academy of Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) states: > Dry needling is a neurophysiological evidence-based treatment technique that > requires effective manual assessment of the neuromuscular system. Physical > therapists are well trained to utilize dry needling in conjunction with > manual physical therapy interventions.

Dry needling for the treatment of myofascial (muscular) trigger points is based on theories similar, but not exclusive, to traditional acupuncture; both acupuncture and dry needling target the trigger points, which is a direct and palpable source of patient pain. A high degree of correspondence is reported between myofascial trigger point dry needling and traditional western acupuncture. Acupuncture and dry needling are similar in the underlying phenomenon and neural processes between trigger points and acupuncture points. There is a high degree of correspondence between published locations of trigger points and classical acupuncture points for the relief of pain. Dry needling, and its treatment techniques and desired effects, would be most directly comparable to the use of 'a-shi' points in acupuncture. However, dry needling theory only begins to describe the complex sensation referral patterns that have been documented as \\"channels\\" or \\"meridians\\" in Chinese Medicine. What further distinguishes dry needling from traditional acupuncture is that it does not use the full range of traditional theories of Chinese Medicine which is used to treat not only pain, but also other non- musculoskeletal issues that often cause pain. The distinction between trigger points and acupuncture points for the relief of pain is blurred. The debated distinction between dry needling and acupuncture has become a controversy because it relates to an issue of scope of practice of various professions. Acupuncturists claim that dry needling is a form of acupuncture that doesn't fall in the scope of physical therapists, chiropractors, or the majority of other healthcare professionals; whereas those healthcare professionals claim dry needling is not acupuncture, but rather a procedure that is rooted in biomedical modern sciences. To become a certified acupuncturist requires hundred of hours spent in educational programs, national level exams, and good professional standings. On the other hand, to be certified in dry needling requires continued education or a certification program that is not yet regulated with strict standards; in addition, there is a general lack of policymakers, evaluation systems, or healthcare standards governing the technique of dry needling.  Technique  Technique for dry needling depends on which tissue is being targeted and what the overall objective of the treatment is. For example, one of the most common treatment objectives for dry needling, myofascial trigger points (TrPs), differs physiologically from treatments for scar tissue, connective tissue issues, and other medical issues. In the treatment of trigger points for persons with myofascial pain syndrome, dry needling is an invasive procedure in which a filiform needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point. A myofascial trigger point consists of multiple, hyperirritable contraction knots related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle; essentially, myofascial trigger points will generate much local pain upon stimulation or irritation. Deep dry needling for treating trigger points was first introduced by Czech physician Karel Lewit in 1979. Lewit had noticed that the success of injections into trigger points in relieving pain was apparently unconnected to the analgesic used. Dry needling can be divided into categories in terms of depth of penetration: deep and superficial dry needling. Deep dry needling will inactivate myofascial triggers points by provoking a local twitch response (LTR), which is an involuntary spinal cord reflex in which the muscle fibers in the taut band of muscle contract. The LTR indicates the proper placement of the needle in a trigger point. Dry needling that elicits LTRs improves treatment outcomes, and may work by activating endogenous opioids. The activation of the endogenous opioids is for an analgesic effect using the Gate Control Theory of Pain. In addition to relieving myofascial trigger points, deep dry needling is also identified to decreases pain, increase range of motion, and minimize myofascial trigger point irritability. In regards to the factor of pain reduction, relief occurs at four central levels: local pain, spinal pain through nerves, brain stem pain, and higher brain center pain. The relief of myofascial trigger points has been more highly researched than relief of connective tissues, muscle fascia, muscle tension, and scar tissue; however, the American Physical Therapy Association claims that there potentially may be some benefits of dry needling on these ailments according to some available evidence. The APTA also disclaims that dry needling should not be used as a standalone procedure, but should be used in conjunction with other treatment methods, including manual soft tissue mobilization, neuromuscular re-education, functional retraining, and therapeutic exercises. Once the needle is inserted, one can manually or electrically stimulate the filiform needle depending for the desired effect of treatment.  Efficacy  There is currently no standardized form of dry needling. There is a general scarcity of extensive research in the field. Many studies published about dry needling are not randomized, contain small sample sizes, and have high dropout rates. A review recommended the usage of dry needling, compared to sham or placebo, for decreasing pain immediately after treatment and at 4 weeks in patients with upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome. However, the authors caution that \\"the limited number of studies performed to date, combined with methodological flaws in many of the studies, prompts caution in interpreting the results of the meta-analysis performed\\". Similarly, a second review of dry needling found insufficient high-quality evidence for the use of direct dry needling for short and long-term pain and disability reduction in patients with musculoskeletal pain syndromes. The same review reported that robust evidence validating the clinical diagnostic criteria for trigger point identification or diagnosis is lacking and that high-quality studies demonstrate that manual examination for the identification and localization of a trigger point is neither valid nor reliable between-examiners. Three more recent reviews reached similar conclusions: little evidence supporting the use of trigger point dry needling to treat upper shoulder pain and dysfunction, evidence not robust enough to draw a clear conclusion about safety and efficacy, and that dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in the lower back appeared to be a useful addition to standard therapies, but stated clear recommendations could not be made because the published studies were small and of low quality. However, a retrospective analysis of 2,910 dry needling interventions as reported by Mabry, et al identified no reported safety events when dry needling was performed by physical therapists.  Controversy  Dry needling is controversial for a number of reasons, one of which being that it is invasive. Invasive treatments bring into play the risks associated with infections, cutaneous infections, and sterility, which can be avoided, however, by using good technique. This invasive procedure is increasing in popularity despite the unanswered questions regarding its overall effectiveness and safety. Mild adverse events following dry needling are commonly bleeding, bruising, and pain. Severe adverse effects include pneumothorax, injury to the central nervous system and spine, and blood-borne infection transmission. The American Medical Association made a press release in 2016 that said physical therapists and other non-physicians practicing dry needling should ‚Äì at a minimum ‚Äì have standards that are similar to the ones for training, certification, and continuing education that exist for acupuncture. AMA board member Russell W. H. Kridel, MD: \\"Lax regulation and nonexistent standards surround this invasive practice. For patients' safety, practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians.\\" Many physical therapists and chiropractors have asserted that they are not practicing acupuncture when dry needling. Much of dry needling research, however, has been done with reference to acupuncture. They assert that much of the basic physiological and biomechanical knowledge that dry needling utilizes is taught as part of their core physical therapy and chiropractic education and that the specific dry needling skills are supplemental to that knowledge and not exclusive to acupuncture. Many acupuncturists have argued that dry needling appears to be an acupuncture technique requiring minimal training that has been re-branded under a new name (\\"dry needling\\"). Whether dry needling is considered to be acupuncture depends on the definition of acupuncture, and it is argued that trigger points do not correspond to acupuncture points or meridians. They correspond by definition to the ad hoc category of 'a-shi' acupoints. It is important to note that this category of points is not necessarily distinct from other formal categories of acupoints. In 1983, Janet Travell described trigger point locations as 92% in correspondence with known acupuncture points. In 2006, Peter T. Dorsher, acupuncturist at the Mayo Clinic, concludes that the two point systems are in over 90% agreement. In 2009, Dorsher and Fleckenstein conclude that the strong (up to 91%) consistency of the distributions of trigger point regions‚Äô referred pain patterns to acupuncture meridians provides evidence that trigger points most likely represent the same physiological phenomenon as acupuncture points in the treatment of pain disorders. An article in Acupuncture Today further corroborates the 92% correspondence of trigger points to acupuncture points. In 2011, The Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) published a position paper describing dry needling as an acupuncture technique. The North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board has published a position statement asserting that dry needling is acupuncture and thus is covered by the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing law, and is not within the present scope of practice of Physical Therapists. The Attorney General was asked for an opinion by the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board which he gave in 2011: \\"In our opinion, the Board of Physical Therapy Examiners may determine that dry needling is within the scope of practice of physical therapy if it conducts rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act and adopts rules that relate dry needling to the statutory definition of practice of physical therapy.\\" But that is a matter of opinion and not a matter of law. The North Carolina Rules Review Committee of the legislative branch found that the North Carolina Physical Therapy Board had no statutory authority for the proposed rule. The Physical Therapy board subsequently decided that they had the right to declare dry needling within scope anyway \\"The Board believes physical therapists can continue to perform dry needling so long as they possess the requisite education and training required by N.C.G.S. ¬ß 90‚Äì270.24(4), but there are no regulations to set the specific requirements for engaging in dry needling.\\" In January 2014, The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners did not have the statutory authority to include dry needling in the scope of practice for chiropractors in that state. The ruling did not address whether chiropractors have the medical expertise to use dry needling or whether the training they were being given was adequate. Pending further discussion of training requirements the Oregon Physical Therapist Licensing Board has advised all Oregon physical therapists against practicing dry needling. They have not changed their ruling that dry needling is within the scope of practice for Oregon Physical Therapists.

Since 1954, the French Fourth Republic had been mired in the Algerian War. In May 1958, Pierre Pflimlin, a Christian-Democrat, became Prime Minister. He was known to be in favour of a negotiated settlement with the Algerian nationalists. On 13 May riots broke out in Algiers, with the complicity of the army. A rebel government seized power in Algiers in order to defend \\"French Algeria\\". The next day, General Massu demanded the return to power of General Charles de Gaulle. The rebellious generals took control of Corsica threatening to conduct an assault on Paris, involving paratroopers and armoured forces based at Rambouillet. In Paris, the political leaders were trying to find a compromise. On 1 June De Gaulle replaced Pflimlin to lead a government of national unity and nominated as Ministers of State (Vice-Prime Ministers) Pierre Pflimlin (Popular Republican Movement, MRP), Guy Mollet (French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Louis Jacquinot (National Center of Independents and Peasants, CNIP) and F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny. He obtained the right to develop a new Constitution. Only the Communists and some center-left politicians such as Pierre Mend√®s-France and Fran√ßois Mitterrand, opposed this \\"coup against the Republic\\". On 28 September the new Constitution was approved by 79.25% of voters. The Fifth Republic was born. The two-round system was re-established for the legislative elections. The Gaullists created the Union for the New Republic which became the largest parliamentary group. Their opponents were crushed. The division in the Left between the supporters and the opponents to the Fifth Republic explained, in due to this ballot system which encourages the alliances, the small number of left-wing MPs. On 21 December de Gaulle was elected President of France by an electoral college. His Justice Minister Michel Debr√© became Prime Minister. The pro-Fifth Republic center-left parties (SFIO and Radical Party) left the presidential majority. This established the first gaullist centre-right government.

It occurs off the eastern United States, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and possibly in parts of the Caribbean Sea. This bottom-dwelling shark is found in shallow inshore waters in summer and fall, and deep offshore waters in winter and spring. The sand devil's flattened body and enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins give it a ray-like appearance. There is a band of enlarged thorns running along the middle of its back. It is gray or brown in color, with scattered small dark spots. This species reaches in length. The diet of the sand devil consists mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4‚Äì25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. Taxonomy and phylogeny French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur described the sand devil in an 1818 volume of Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Previously, it had been regarded as the same species as the European Squatina squatina. Lesueur based his account on an adult male long caught off the eastern United States, and named the species in honor of Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril. Phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, has concluded that the sand devil and the Pacific angel shark (S. californica) are sister species. The two of them in turn form a clade with other angel sharks found in the Americas. Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around the time that the Isthmus of Panama formed. The rise of the Isthmus likely split the ancestral angel shark population, leading to their becoming separate species. Description The sand devil has a flattened, moderately narrow body with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds along the sides of the head have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on top of the head and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with smooth edges. There are five pairs of gill slits located on the sides of the head. The pectoral fins are broad and angular with narrow rear tips; the front of the pectoral fin is separate from the head, forming a triangular lobe. The two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape, and are positioned far back on the body. The anal fin is absent. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the upper. The dermal denticles have rounded bases and three horizontal ridges. There is a distinctive band of larger thorns running along the midline of the back, from the nape to the caudal peduncle. The dorsal coloration varies from greenish or bluish gray to reddish brown, with a scattering of small, darker spots and sometimes irregular splotches; the underside is uniformly pale. This species reaches in length and at least in weight. Squatina dumeril SI.jpg|The sand devil is a ray-like shark with a color pattern of many small dark spots on a gray-brown background. Squatina dumeril SI2.jpg|Underside Squatina dumeril jaws.jpg|Jaws Squatina dumeril jaws2.jpg|Jaws Squatina dumeril central teeth2.jpg|Central teeth Squatina dumeril lower teeth.jpg|Lower teeth Distribution and habitat The sand devil is found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to the Florida Keys, where it is fairly common. It also occurs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and there are additional unconfirmed records from Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The southern extent of its range is uncertain due to confusion with the disparate angelshark (S. heteroptera) and Mexican angelshark (S. mexicana). Because they inhabit deep-waters and because of their low commercial value the effort put into data collection is low, as with many species under these circumstances. Although their appearances are fragmented they still are classified under large broader spaces due to the lack of research done. As a result, ranges of deep-water shark species are often considered continuous across broad expanses de-spite records of occurrence, in many cases, being spatially fragmented. This bottom-dwelling shark is found over sandy or muddy bottoms on the continental shelf and slope. Off the eastern United States, the sand devil has been documented to migrate seasonally. In the summer, it moves towards the shore to depths of less than , and many can be found in water only meters deep. During fall it can be found inshore, down to a depth of . In winter and spring, it is found around the outer continental shelf at depths greater than ; individuals have been recorded as far as from land and deep. Biology and ecology The Atlantic croaker is an important food source for the sand devil. The sand devil is an ambush predator that spends much time buried in the bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps because they are more active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50‚Äì60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula. Sand devil embryo with external yolk sac. Like other angel sharks, the sand devil is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. Mature females have one functional ovary, on the left, and two functional uteruses. Mating occurs in the spring; adult males have spines on the outer margins of their pectoral fins, which may help in gripping the female during copulation. Females reproduce no more than once every two years, perhaps longer. Litter size varies from four to 25 pups, and does not appear related to the size of the female. The gestation period lasts roughly 12 months, and birthing occurs between February and June at depths of . The newborns measure in length. Males and females sexually mature at around long respectively; the fact that females mature at a smaller size than males is unusual among sharks. Human interactions Though not normally aggressive towards humans, the sand devil can inflict serious wounds if provoked. Its common name refers to its habit of snapping vigorously at fishery workers when caught, and even out of the water it is capable of lunging upwards to bite. This shark is caught incidentally in bottom trawls operated by commercial fisheries targeting other species. It is edible but seldom brought to market. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently rates this species as least concern.

G. Wells. Because of the complexity and sophistication of its narrative structure, A Modern Utopia has been called \\"not so much a modern as a postmodern utopia.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 165. The novel is best known for its notion that a voluntary order of nobility known as the Samurai could effectively rule a \\"kinetic and not static\\" world stateH.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 75. Wells first introduces the term \\"World State\\" three pages earlier, in ¬ß1 of Ch. 3. The notion of a samurai order was suggested to him by Nitobe Inazo's Bushido (1900). Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Sort of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 165. so as to solve \\"the problem of combining progress with political stability\\".Introduction by Mark R. Hillegas to new ed. of H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 271 (Ch. 9, ¬ß3). Conception of the work In his preface Wells forecasts (incorrectly) that A Modern Utopia would be the last of a series of volumes on social problems that he began in 1901 with Anticipations and that included Mankind in the Making (1903). Unlike those non-fictional works, A Modern Utopia is presented as a tale told by a sketchily described character known only as the Owner of the Voice, who, Wells warns the reader, \\"is not to be taken as the Voice of the ostensible author who fathers these pages\\".H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 1. He is accompanied by another character known as \\"the botanist\\". Interspersed into the narrative are discursive remarks on various matters, creating what Wells calls in his preface \\"a sort of shot-silk texture between philosophical discussion on the one hand and imaginative narrative on the other.\\".H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. xxxii. In addition, there are frequent comparisons to and discussions of previous utopian works.Wells read Plato's Republic in the early 1880s and was deeply marked, even radicalized, by it. Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 50-51. Plato is often discussed in A Modern Utopia, but so is almost every other major work in the western utopian tradition. In his Experiment in Autobiography (1934) Wells wrote that A Modern Utopia \\"was the first approach I made to the dialogue form\\", and that \\"the trend towards dialogue, like the basal notion of the Samurai, marks my debt to Plato. A Modern Utopia, quite as much as that of More, derives frankly from the Republic.\\"H. G. Wells, Experiment in Autobiography (1934), 562 The premise of the novel is that there is a planet (for \\"No less than a planet will serve the purpose of a modern Utopia\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 11.) exactly like Earth, with the same geography and biology. Moreover, on that planet \\"all the men and women that you know and I\\" exist \\"in duplicate\\".H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 25. They have, however, \\"different habits, different traditions, different knowledge, different ideas, different clothing, and different appliances.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 23. (Not however, a different language: \\"Indeed, should we be in Utopia at all, if we could not talk to everyone?\\").H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 17. Plot To this planet \\"out beyond Sirius\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 12. the Owner of the Voice and the botanist are translated, imaginatively, \\"in the twinkling of an eye . . . We should scarcely note the change. Not a cloud would have gone from the sky.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 14. Their point of entry is on the slopes of the Piz Lucendro in the Swiss Alps. The adventures of these two characters are traced through eleven chapters. Little by little they discover how Utopia is organized. It is a world with \\"no positive compulsions at all . . . for the adult Utopian‚Äîunless they fall upon him as penalties incurred.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 34. The Owner of the Voice and the botanist are soon required to account for their presence. When their thumbprints are checked against records in \\"the central index housed in a vast series of buildings at or near Paris,\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 163. both discover they have doubles in Utopia. They journey to London to meet them, and the Owner of the Voice's double is a member of the Samurai, a voluntary order of nobility that rules Utopia. \\"These samurai form the real body of the State.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 277. Running through the novel as a foil to the main narrative is the botanist's obsession with an unhappy love affair back on Earth. The Owner of the Voice is annoyed at this undignified and unworthy insertion of earthly affairs in Utopia, but when the botanist meets the double of his beloved in Utopia the violence of his reaction bursts the imaginative bubble that has sustained the narrative and the two men find themselves back in early twentieth-century London.H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 358. As alternate history Researcher Michael Warren Michael B. Warren, \\"The Minutiae of the History of Alternate History\\", p. 5.12 in Margaret Southfield (ed.), \\"Round Up of New Essays in Twentieth Century Popular Culture\\". noted that A Modern Utopia was never meant to be one of Wells' landmark Science Fiction works, but was a thinly disguised sociological and philosophical essay. Placing his Utopia in an Alternate History was simply a plot device forced upon him since the world was already very thoroughly explored; unlike Thomas More or Jonathan Swift, Wells could not plausibly locate his Utopian society on an island or an unexplored corner of a faraway continent; there were none such. (...) Still, A Modern Utopia did make a very significant contribution to the genre. Alternate History of one kind or another had already been written decades earlier - but Wells seems to be the first to posit when you make the transit to the Utopian timeline in the Alps, you find yourself in the very same spot in the other world's Alps, and when you travel in the Utopian world to an Utopian London and then cross back to our world, you find yourself on the same spot in our mundane London. This one-to-one correspondence was taken up by countless others, and is now taken for granted by any Alternate History fan - but it should be added to the great list of standard Science Fiction plot devices for which we are in debt to Wells' genius.\\" Utopian economics The world shares the same language, coinage, customs, and laws, and freedom of movement is general.H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 45. Some personal property is allowed, but \\"all natural sources of force, and indeed all strictly natural products\\" are \\"inalienably vested in the local authorities\\" occupying \\"areas as large sometimes as half England.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 77. The World State is \\"the sole landowner of the earth.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 89. Units of currency are based on units of energy, so that \\"employment would constantly shift into the areas where energy was cheap.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 79. Humanity has been almost entirely liberated from the need for physical labor: \\"There appears to be no limit to the invasion of life by the machine.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 98. The samurai and Utopian society The narrator's double describes the ascetic Rule by which the samurai live: it includes a ban on alcohol and drugs, and a mandatory annual one-week solitary ramble in the wilderness. He also explains the social theory of Utopia, which distinguished four \\"main classes of mind\\": The Poietic, the Kinetic, the Dull, and the Base.H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 265. Poietic minds are creative or inventive; kinetic minds are able but not particularly inventive; the Dull have \\"inadequate imagination,\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 268. and the Base are mired in egotism and lack \\"moral sense.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), pp. 269-70. The relations of the sexes There is extensive discussion of gender roles in A Modern Utopia, but no recognition of the existence of homosexuality. A chapter entitled \\"Women in a Modern Utopia\\" makes it clear that women are to be as free as men. Motherhood is subsidized by the state. Only those who can support themselves can marry, women at 21 and men at 26 or 27.H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 192. Marriages that remain childless \\"expire\\" after a term of three to five years, but the partners may marry again if they choose.H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 196. Race in Utopia A Modern Utopia is also notable for Chapter 10 (\\"Race in Utopia\\"), an enlightened discussion of race. Contemporary racialist discourse is condemned as crude, ignorant, and extravagant. \\"For my own part I am disposed to discount all adverse judgments and all statements of insurmountable differences between race and race.\\"H.G. Wells, A Modern Utopia (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967), p. 334. Meat The narrator is told, \\"In all the round world of Utopia there is no meat. There used to be. But now we cannot stand the thought of slaughter-houses. And, in a population that is all educated, and at about the same level of physical refinement, it is practically impossible to find anyone who will hew a dead ox or pig. We never settled the hygienic question of meat-eating at all. This other aspect decided us. I can still remember, as a boy, the rejoicings over the closing of the last slaughter-house\\". Origins The work was partly inspired by a trip to the Alps Wells made with his friend Graham Wallas, a prominent member of the Fabian Society. Reception Several Samurai societies were formed in response to A Modern Utopia, and Wells met members of one of them in April 1907 at the New Reform Club.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 101. At a memorial service at the Royal Institution on 30 October 1946, two and a half months after Wells's death, William Beveridge read passages from the book and called it the work that had influenced him the most.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 484. According to Vincent Brome, Wells's first comprehensive biographer after his death, it was widely read by university students and \\"released hundreds of young people into sexual adventure.\\"Vincent Brome, H.G. Wells: A Biography (London: Longsman, Green, 1951), p. 96. W. Warren Wagar praised it, describing it and Wells's other utopian novels (Men Like Gods and The Shape of Things to Come) as \\"landmarks in that extraordinarily difficult genre\\".Wager, W. Warren. \\"Wells, H(erbert) G(eorge)\\", in Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, (p.779-83). Joseph Conrad complained to Wells that he did not \\"take sufficient account of human imbecility, which is cunning and perfidious.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 100. E.M. Forster satirised what he regarded as the book's unhealthy conformism in his science-fiction story \\"The Machine Stops\\", first published only four years later, in 1909. Marie-Louise Berneri was also critical of the book, stating that \\"Wells commits the faults of his forerunners by introducing a vast amount of legislation into his utopia\\" and that \\"Wells's conception of freedom turns out to be a very narrow one\\".Marie-Louise Berneri, Journey through Utopia, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1950. (p. 295) Wells's biographer Michael Sherborne criticizes the book for depicting \\"an undemocratic one-party state\\" in which truth is established not by critical discussion but by shared faith.

Hess, a real-life United States Air Force fighter pilot in the Korean War who helped evacuate several hundred war orphans to safety. The cast also includes Anna Kashfi, Dan Duryea, Don DeFore, Philip Ahn, and Martha Hyer. The film was produced by Ross Hunter and filmed in CinemaScope. Hess's autobiography of the same name was published concurrently with the release of the film. He donated his profits from the film and the book to a network of orphanages he helped to establish. The film is one of the most well-known American films about the Korean War. In South Korea, it is noted for its depiction of Col. Hess (known as the ‚ÄúFather of the Korean War Orphans‚Äù), and is aired annually during Memorial Day. Plot In the summer of 1950, one month after the invasion of South Korea, Dean Hess has been a small town minister in Ohio for two years. He has been suffering a crisis of conscience, however. He realizes he cannot continue as a priest, due to the overwhelming guilt he still feels from accidentally dropping a bomb on an orphanage and killing 37 children, when he was a fighter pilot in Germany during World War II. Hess volunteers to return to the cockpit, leaving his wife behind in Ohio. He promises her he won't see combat, he will be the senior USAF advisor/Instructor Pilot to the Republic of Korea Air Force, only serving as a teacher and flying F-51D Mustangs. As Hess and his cadre of USAF instructors train the South Korean pilots, young orphaned Korean refugees begin to gather at the base - first a few, but soon dozens. Hess takes pity on the children and orders them to be fed. Soon, he solicits the aid of two Korean adults, En Soon Yang and Lun Wa, and establishes a shelter for the orphans in an abandoned Buddhist temple, which soon has over 400 children. En Soon Yang falls in love with Hess, but does not tell him directly. Instead, she tells him of a Korean tradition that the pine tree represents eternity, because it does not change with the seasons. She tells him of two pine trees planted on her native island of Cheju, honoring two lovers who could not be together in this life. Later, she listens, heartbroken, as he tells her his wife back home is pregnant. Capt. Skidmore chooses to engage an enemy convoy while on a training mission, even though they have been forbidden to do so, because it could risk their planes, which are needed for training. Hess punishes Skidmore on his return, and Skidmore wonders aloud what has become of the fierce warrior he knew in WWII. Hess's identity as a priest back home (which he has kept a secret) is finally revealed by a letter addressed to \\"Reverend Dean Hess.\\" When North Korean forces near the training facility, Hess must go into combat again, with his men, and finds himself forced to kill another human being, when he must shoot down a North Korean plane that is about to down one of his men. Skidmore is killed in the battle, but as he dies in Hess's arms, Hess is able to speak words that give Skidmore comfort, restoring Hess's faith in his ability to be a minister. Hess receives transfer orders and says his farewells to En Soon Yang, but once back in Seoul he learns that the North Koreans have begun an offensive, and the area around the orphanage has been abandoned to them. He hurries back and helps En Soon Yang evacuate the four hundred orphans on foot, struggling unsuccessfully to find planes or ships that can rescue them all. As they shelter at an abandoned airfield, a North Korean jet strafes the refugees, and En Soon Yang is shot as she throws herself in front of a young girl. Mortally wounded, she dies in Hess's arms. Soon after they bury her, when all hope seems nearly lost, an airlift of USAF cargo aircraft suddenly shows up, sent by Hess's commanding officer, to evacuate them all to Cheju island, where En Soon Yang described an abandoned building that could be used as an orphanage. Some time later, when peace has been restored, Hess and his wife return to Cheju to visit the orphanage, which has been dedicated to En Soon Yang and sits next to the two pine trees she spoke of earlier.

Park * Amzie Strickland as Mrs. Peterson * General Earle E. Partridge as Himself  Historical accuracy  Like many biographical and historical films, Battle Hymn takes significant artistic license in depicting the life and wartime activities of Hess and his colleagues. * The film depicts Dean Hess as a minister in West Hampton, Ohio, retired from active duty, who volunteers for combat service in the Air Force in July 1950. In reality, Hess was recalled to duty in July 1948, and transferred to Japan in April 1950, two months before the North Korean invasion across the 38th parallel. Furthermore, Hess had stopped preaching in December 1941 after first enlisting in the Air Force, and at the time of his recall was completing a doctoral degree in history and psychology at Ohio State University. * Hess' hometown was Marietta, not the fictionalized \\"West Hampton\\" as depicted in the film. * The film fictionalizes an incident in which Hess accidentally killed 37 children in Germany during World War II, after dropping a bomb on an orphanage. The real incident occurred in Kaiserslautern, whereas the film states it took place in \\"Kaiserberg\\", said to be the birthplace of his late grandmother. Furthermore, Hess did not return to the site after the incident occurred as depicted in the film. * In the film, there was an incident where a pilot named Lieutenant Maples (played by James Edwards and based on Ernest Craigwell) accidentally strafes a truckload of civilian refugees that happened to be near a convoy of North Korean troop trucks. In the real-life incident, it was a fishing junk full of civilian refugees that happened to be near an amphibious assault by North Korean landing craft. The film also removes Hess' involvement in a similar accident, in which he inadvertently strafed a group of refugees due to misinformation received from a liaison pilot. * En Soon Yang (played by Anna Kashfi) is based on On Soon Hwang, a social worker who became the directress of the Cheju orphanage and later chaperoned the Korean orphans who participated in the film's production. Unlike En Soon, the real On Soon was twenty years Hess' senior and did not die in a bombing raid as depicted in the film. She was also not half-Anglo-Indian as depicted in the film.  Production  The real Lt. Col. Hess was a technical advisor to Universal to ensure that the final production did not stray far from his original biography. Nonetheless, the inevitable \\"Hollywood\\" screenplay prevailed.Farmer 1986, pp. 68‚Äì69. Hess had a hand in vetoing the studio's first choice to play him: Robert Mitchum, having reservations about the actor's character.Tomkies 1972, p. 135. Unable to film in Korea, locations shifted to Nogales, Arizona that provided at least a modicum of similar landscape. On Soon Whang, Director of the Orphans Home of Korea arrived in the U.S. along with 25 orphans who would reprise their own lives on film.Farmer 1986, p. 69. Rock Hudson as Col. Hess gathers up a group of orphans. In order to replicate the ROK unit, the 12 F-51D Mustangs of 182nd Fighter Squadron, 149th Fighter Group of the Texas Air National Guard were enlisted by the USAF to provide the necessary authentic aircraft of the period. During filming, an additional surplus F-51 was acquired from USAF stocks to be used in an accident scene where it would be deliberately destroyed.Farmer 1986, p. 70. The gold flying helmet with the United Nations emblem that Rock Hudson wears in the movie was Dean Hess's actual helmet. It was a Navy-issue helmet that Hess scrounged from a Navy pilot who crash-landed at their airfield in Korea (since the Navy pilot was going to be issued a new helmet as a result of the crash-landing). The helmet is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact- Sheets/Display/Article/196376/bout-one-building-a-south-korean-air-force/ ANG F-51Ds \\"stood in\\" for the ROK. Richard Loo filmed scenes as a character based on ROK Air Force chief General Kim Chung-yul, which were deleted from the final release print, though he was still listed in the film‚Äôs credits. Reception Bosley Crowther wrote about the film in The New York Times, saying, \\"Perhaps the most candid comment to be made about Universal's 'Battle Hymn' is also the most propitious, so far as its box-office chances are concerned. That is to say, it is conventional. It follows religiously the line of mingled piety and pugnacity laid down for standard idealistic service films. What's more, it has Rock Hudson playing the big hero role. And it is in CinemaScope and color. Wrap them up and what have you got? The popular thing.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Battle Hymn (1956): Screen: All the cliches; 'Battle Hymn' is usual film about service.\\" The New York Times, February 16, 1957. Other reviews commented \\"Historians will like this movie, as it accurately portrays the most important moments in the subject's life. For this, it cannot be faulted. Military enthusiasts will be similarly impressed with it for it what it gets right. The movie-going public on the other hand, may find it boring.\\"Hawaii in the Movies, 1898-1959 by Robert C Schmitt, 1988, Hawaiian Historical Society pg. 99 Popular culture A poster for Battle Hymn appears outside the movie theater in the 1959 pilot episode of The Twilight Zone, \\"Where Is Everybody?\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 References Notes Citations Bibliography * Dolan, Edward F.

He was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in 1894. He is sometimes referred to as \\"the Japanese Adam Smith\\",De Bary, William Theodore, Carol Gluck and Arthur E. Tiedemann eds. (2005). Sources of Japanese Tradition: Volume Two: 1600 to 2000. Second Edition. New York: Columbia University Press. pp1227ff. as he wrote many journal articles advocating certain economic reforms and policies. Biography Perhaps Taguchi's most famous work is his Short History of Japanese Civilization (, Nippon kaika sh≈çshi). He put forth one of the first, and most famous, bunmeishi versions of Japanese history, focusing on the Japanese people and their culture, rather than on the governments, and on the role of the people in the country's overall progress over the ages. This approach differed from that of so-called kokushi historians of the time, who focused on the governments, and on a nationalistic version of history, emphasizing the nation-state. Taguchi's approach also differed drastically from that of earlier histories, which praised individual historical figures and elevated them as heroes. Taguchi denounced this practice, and many other elements of Confucian moralist history, seeking to describe history as accurately and objectively as possible, eliminating the literary or mythological aspects of heroes and villains. Taguchi also wrote a number of other historical texts, published collections of classical documents in large-scale print runs, many of which survive today, and edited a historical journal called Shikai (, \\"Ocean of History\\"). This journal would ignite a controversy in 1892 which would cost major kokushi historian Kume Kunitake his job. Though his historical works were fairly thorough in their treatment of culture, technology, and other aspects of historical study, Taguchi's expertise was in economics. In addition to a number of texts on Japanese economic history, he founded an economics journal, Tokyo Economics Magazine (, T≈çky≈ç keizai zasshi), and proposed a number of plans for the reform and restructuring of Japan's economy in the wake of the Meiji Restoration. In his work ‚ÄòNihon jinshu ron‚Äô (On the Japanese Race) from 1898 he proposed that the Japanese race was part of the Aryan race and was superior not only to the Chinese race but also superior to the other Aryan races.Yasuko Takezawa (2015) Translating and Transforming ‚ÄòRace‚Äô: Early Meiji Period Textbooks, Japanese Studies, 35:1, 5-21, DOI: 10.1080/10371397.2015.1041219 References *Frederic, Louis (2002). \\"Japan Encyclopedia.\\" Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.

The reef consists of two groups of rocks and is nearly long and in breadth. They rise out of deep water and are a navigational hazard for shipping with 71 named wrecks and an estimated 200 shipwrecks overall. The most infamous is the Torrey Canyon in 1967, which was at that time the world's costliest shipping disaster, and to date, still the worst oil spill on the coast of the United Kingdom. The Sevenstones lightvessel has been situated to the east of the reef since 1841, to warn ships of the danger and to mark the western boundary of a major north/south shipping route between the Isles of Scilly and the Cornish coast. An automatic weather station is on the lightvessel. Geography Situated between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, the Seven Stones reef consists of seven (or eight) peaks, some of which appear at half ebb and others at low tide. They rise out of deep water, at and extend nearly two miles from north-northwest (NNW) to south-southeast (SSE) and are about a mile wide. The sea always breaks over the reef and in good weather, breakers are visible up to away. The rocks consists of small-grained granite which is part of the larger Cornubian batholith. The batholith formed during the Early Permian period, from about 300 to 275 Ma, at a late stage in the Variscan orogeny. Some of the stones have been given names and include Flat Ledge, Flemish Ledges, North-east Rocks, Pollard's Rock, South Rock and a ledge known as the Town. During the 1960s the reef was fished by a small fleet of French fishing vessels for crab, crayfish and lobster. Some of these vessels were the first on the scene when the Torrey Canyon ran aground in 1967. On the vertical surfaces of the more exposed rocks there are clusters of jewel anemones and hydroids, and plumose anemones. Shipwrecks The reef is a major hazard to shipping as it is on the western boundary of a major north/south shipping route between the Cornish coast and the Isles of Scilly. The lightvessel, which has been on site since 1841, is to the north-east, not on the reef, a safety measure, as the sea is less rough away from the reef and also to ensure passing ships give the reef a wide berth. It is estimated that there are over 200 shipwrecks although only 71 are named. The first recorded wreck was in early March 1656. Two English men o'war, the Primrose and Mayflower, were searching for two Spanish frigates which had been patrolling the area and had captured a Bristol bound vessel. The sixth rate, 22 gun man o'war, Primrose lost her main topmast near the Longships, off Land‚Äôs End and drifted onto the Seven Stones. She managed to free herself and later sank in taking sixteen men, two women and a child with her. At the investigation into the loss, Trinity House, on behalf of the Admiralty, stated that they could not find any chart that showed the reef. The Admiralty found that there was no neglect either by the Officers or company, the place of wreck being a rock not visible nor described in any chart they could find. The largest loss of life was on 27 February 1748 with the sinking of the fourteen gun sloop HMS Lizard which was wrecked with the loss of over one hundred crew. On 18 March 1967 the world‚Äôs first major oil pollution incident occurred when a supertanker, the Torrey Canyon hit the Pollard‚Äôs Rock, tearing a gash in her side and spilling 860,000 barrels of oil into the sea. Westerly winds and currents caused the oil to pollute of the Cornish coast and of the Brittany coast. She now lies in of water. Large amounts of toxic detergent was sprayed on the oil in an attempt to disperse it and, along with the oil, accounted for the loss of much of the marine life and 15,000 birds. At the time it was the world's costliest shipping disaster, and to date, still the worst oil spill on the coast of the United Kingdom. Seven Stones lightvessel The government was first petitioned for a light on the reef in 1826 (with no success), and a second petition in 1839 was supported by the British Channel ports, Liverpool merchants and the Chamber of Commerce of Waterford. A meeting held on 21 February 1840 in Falmouth declared the reef would shorten the route around the Isles of Scilly by up to 36 hours, and on 31 July 1841 a lightvessel (also known as a lightship) was seen at nearby St Mary's, Isles of Scilly. A lightvessel was first moored near the reef on 20 August 1841 and exhibited its first light on 1 September 1841. She is permanently anchored in and is north- east (NE) of the reef. Just over a year later on 25 November 1842 her cable parted and she almost became a wreck when she drove over the reef at high tide. The crew steered the ship to New Grimsby, Tresco where she stayed until 6 January 1843. She broke adrift again that January and went over the reef a second time the following March. Two of the crew drowned on 15 October 1851 when one of the lightship's longboats capsized, in a squall, on a journey from Scilly with stores. A meteor exploded over the lightvessel, at 2 am on 13 November 1872, showering the deck with cinders. The ship was replaced with a lighted buoy during the Second World War after being frequently bombed and machine-gunned by German pilots. Since 1987, the ship has been automated and unmanned with the accommodation and storage areas filled with foam to help with buoyancy in the event of a collision. The Seven Stones lightvessel also acts as an automatic weather station. Folklore There is a legend, part of the King Arthur scenario, that there was once a land between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, known as Lyonesse, with several towns and 140 churches. In the legend it was flooded and became sea. Only one man survived, Trevelyan, who riding on a black horse managed to reach dry land. The area is also part of Arthurian legend when Merlin cast a spell to engulf the land and the forces of Mordred who were chasing the fleeing army of King Arthur who he had just slain in battle. Arthur‚Äôs supporters managed to reach high ground in the Isles of Scilly. Fishermen are said to be able to hear the sound of church bells. Rising sea levels since the last ice age fathered the legend and they may have been an island in the not too distant past.

Its follow-up series Did They Pay Off Their Mortgage in Two Years? began airing in January 2007. Presented by business expert Ren√© Carayol, the programme is an experiment that aims to find out if ordinary people in the United Kingdom can pay off their mortgage in two years. Various methods of mortgage acceleration are explained to help viewers succeed in paying off their mortgages early. Pay Off Your Mortgage In Two Years (first series) Each of the eight episodes aired weekly in 2006 focused on one family or individual, who at the time of filming had already been followed for twelve months, i.e. they were halfway through the experiment. In the follow-up series, aired in 2007, their experiences in the second year was shown. The participants were from all ages and from all walks of life, including a couple nearing retirement, families with young children, a lesbian couple and a male ballet dancer. Success in the experiment required minimizing expenses as well as maximizing income. To achieve the former, participants grew their own food, for example. In pursuit of the latter, they sold off possessions, rented out their house or tried to develop various business initiatives, such as creating works of art, giving yoga or exercise classes, becoming a Cliff Richard impersonator or buy and renovate houses. In some cases, leaving the \\"comfort zone\\" and persevering required hard-nosed presenter Carayol to, in his own words, \\"push them to their limits\\". One of the participants, a single woman, gave up and was replaced. Did They Pay Off Their Mortgage In Two Years? (second series) The second series of weekly programmes began on 11 January 2007. The six episodes followed the trials and tribulations of all those that agreed to initially take part. Two of the couples paid off their mortgage, including Dan & Lucy with their successful Hotpod burners - the prototype of which Carayol originally found in Dan and Lucy's living room and subsequently helped turn into a thriving business. With the series attracting praise from the media and the focus shifting more from mortgages to that of the transformations in all the contestants lives, the series was moved from a 7.30pm time slot on BBC2 to a prime time airing of 8pm.

The bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura lymma) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. Found from the intertidal zone to a depth of , this species is common throughout the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans in nearshore, coral reef-associated habitats. It is a fairly small ray, not exceeding in width, with a mostly smooth, oval pectoral fin disc, large protruding eyes, and a relatively short and thick tail with a deep fin fold underneath. It can be easily identified by its striking color pattern of many electric blue spots on a yellowish background, with a pair of blue stripes on the tail. At night, small groups of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the rising tide onto sandy flats to root for small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  A bluespotted ribbontail ray in Komodo National Park, Indonesia. The bluespotted ribbontail ray was originally described as Raja lymma by Swedish naturalist Peter Forssk√•l, in his 1775 Descriptiones Animalium quae in itinere ad maris australis terras per annos 1772, 1773, et 1774 suscepto collegit, observavit, et delineavit Joannes Reinlioldus Forster, etc., curante Henrico Lichtenstein.Eschmeyer, W.N. and R. Fricke, eds. lymma, Raja . Catalog of Fishes electronic version (January 15, 2010). Retrieved on February 17, 2010. The specific epithet lymma means \\"dirt\\". Forssk√•l did not designate a type specimen. In 1837, German biologists Johannes Peter M√ºller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle created the genus Taeniura for Trygon ornatus, now known to be a junior synonym of this species.Eschmeyer, W.N. and R. Fricke, eds. Taeniura . Catalog of Fishes electronic version (January 15, 2010). Retrieved on February 17, 2010. Other common names used for this species include bluespotted ray, bluespotted fantail ray, bluespotted lagoon ray, bluespotted stingray, fantail ray, lesser fantail ray, lagoon ray, reef ray, ribbon-tailed stingray, and ribbontail stingray. Morphological examination has suggested that the bluespotted ribbontail ray is more closely related to the amphi- American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.  Distribution and habitat  Widespread in the nearshore waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific region, the bluespotted ribbontail ray has a range that extends around the periphery of the Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia, including Madagascar, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. It is rare in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. In the Pacific Ocean, this species is found from the Philippines to northern Australia, as well as around numerous Melanesian and Polynesian islands as far east as the Solomon Islands. Rarely found deeper than , the bluespotted ribbontail ray is a bottom-dwelling species that frequents coral reefs and adjacent sandy flats. It is also commonly encountered in the intertidal zone and tidal pools, and has been sighted near seagrass beds. Every summer, considerable numbers of bluespotted ribbontail rays arrive off South Africa.  Description  The bluespotted ribbontail ray has distinctive coloration. The pectoral fin disc of the bluespotted ribbontail ray is oval in shape, around four-fifths as wide as long, with a rounded to broadly angular snout. The large, protruding eyes are immediately followed by the broad spiracles. There is a narrow flap of skin between the nares with a fringed posterior margin, reaching past the mouth. The lower jaw dips at the middle and deep furrows are present at the mouth corners. There are 15‚Äì24 tooth rows in either jaw, arranged into pavement-like plates, and two large papillae on the floor of the mouth. The pelvic fins are narrow and angular. The thick, depressed tail measures about 1.5 times the disc length and bears one or two (usually two) serrated spines well behind the tail base; there is a deep fin fold on the ventral surface, reaching the tip of the tail, and a low midline ridge on the upper surface. The skin is generally smooth, save for perhaps a scattering of small thorns on the middle of the back. The dorsal coloration is striking, consisting of numerous circular, neon blue spots on a yellowish brown or green background; the spots vary in size, becoming smaller and denser towards the disc margin. The tail has two stripes of the same blue running along each side as far as the spines. The eyes are bright yellow and the belly is white. Individuals found off southern Africa may lack the blue tail stripes. The bluespotted ribbontail ray grows to across, long, and .  Biology and ecology  The bluespotted ribbontail ray hides amongst coral during the day. One of the most abundant stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand.Bester, C. Biological Profiles: Bluespotted Ribbontail Ray . Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on November 13, 2009. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by the body of the ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.Miller, J. (2002). Taeniura lymma (On-line). Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved on November 13, 2009. Breeding in the bluespotted ribbontail ray occurs from late spring to summer; the male follows the female and nips at her disc, eventually biting and holding onto her for copulation. There is also a documented instance of a male holding onto the disc of a smaller male bluespotted stingray (Dasyatis kuhlii), in a possible case of mistaken identity. Adult males have been observed gathering in shallow water, which may relate to reproduction. Like other stingrays, this species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are initially sustained by yolk, which later in development is supplemented by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\", containing mucus, fat, and proteins) produced by the mother. The gestation period is uncertain, but is thought to be between four and twelve months long. Females bear litters of up to seven young, each a miniature version of the adult measuring around across. Males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of ; the maturation size of females is unknown. Known predators of the bluespotted ribbontail ray include hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops); it is also potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern, to throw off pursuers. Numerous parasites have been identified from this species: the tapeworms Aberrapex manjajiae, Anthobothrium taeniuri, Cephalobothrium taeniurai, Echinobothrium elegans and E. helmymohamedi, Kotorelliella jonesi, Polypocephalus saoudi, and Rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and R. taeniuri, the monogeneans Decacotyle lymmae, Empruthotrema quindecima, Entobdella australis, and Pseudohexabothrium taeniurae, the flatworms Pedunculacetabulum ghardaguensis and Anaporrhutum albidum, the nematode Mawsonascaris australis, the copepod Sheina orri, and the protozoan Trypanosoma taeniurae. This ray has been observed soliciting cleanings from the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) by raising the margins of its disc and pelvic fins.  Human interactions  A bluespotted ribbontail ray being housed within an aquarium in which they rarely live long. While timid and innocuous towards humans, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is capable of inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines. Its attractive appearance and relatively small size has resulted in its being the most common stingray found in the home aquarium trade. It seldom fares well in captivity and few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long. Many specimens refuse to feed in the aquarium, and seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding. A higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (for example, a total of 15 pups were born at Lisbon Oceanarium from 2011 to 2013). The bluespotted ribbontail ray is utilized as food in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia; it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets, longlines, spears, and fence traps. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. Its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.

Initially primarily as a scientific organisation, today MNS is involved in a wide range of environmental activities and campaigns. In 2008 MNS was awarded the inaugural Merdeka Award for the environment, primarily for its efforts in campaigning for the protection of the Belum-Temengor forests of Malaysia. MNS is a voluntary, membership-based organisation with approximately 3800 members. The Society has branches in most of the states in Malaysia. One of the branches was located in Singapore due to the historical ties the island state has with Malaysia. The Singaporean branch later transformed itself into an independent Nature Society (Singapore) in 1991.About NSS . Extracted November 10, 2006 Principal achievements MNS has been credited for a number of conservation achievements as a result of public campaigns. One of the first of these successes was the halting of the quarrying at Batu Caves in 1980. This was followed by the creation of Endau Rompin National Park, following its expeditions there in 1985 and 1986. More recently, it succeeded in its campaigns to get the northern part of Belum-Temengor declared a state parkJoin MNS. Malaysian Naturalist. Vol 59/3 2006. Malaysian Nature Society. and for a national park to be established on Penang island. MNS' Kuala Selangor Nature Park (KSNP) was honoured and acknowledged in July 2012 by the Selangor State Government, as one of the best ecotourism sites in the state. In September 2012, MNS bagged the EU-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce & Industry Europa 2012 Award at a gala dinner in Kuala Lumpur. MNS also received honour by UKM with Community Engagement Excellence Award in recognition for its outstanding partnership with Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) in reaching out to communities. Besides, MNS was honoured the \\"Pertubuhan Cemerlang\\" or Excellent Society award by the Registrar of Societies of Malaysia in March 2014. Furthermore, MNS was awarded by KFEMCA (Korean Federation for Environmental Movements in Cheonan-Asan) and KEEC (Kwang Environmental Education Center) in January 2015. MNS has also been influential in changing government policy on environmental issues ranging from industrial pollution to wildlife protection to banning Shark's fin soup from official government functions.ChannelNewsAsia.com, Malaysian ministry bans shark's fin soup Members' activities MNS member activities, such as evening talks and excursions on natural history topics, are organised through a network of local branches. Several branches have special interest groups focusing on one particular activity, such as bird watching, nature photography, or jungle trekking. Branches are also active in local conservation projects. Annual Events Annually, MNS organizes 2 major events which focuses on habitat conservation: Raptor Watch: celebrated annually since the year 2000 in the first weekend of March, this event was created to help promote and conserve the Tanjung Tuan. This forest is important for the migratory raptors to rest and find food as they travel back to their home in the Northern Hemisphere. Pesta Sayap (Festival of Wings): held annually in Kuala Selangor Nature Park, this event focuses on educating local school children and the community of the importance of wetlands to the ecosystem. This festival is held in the month of October, during the migration of waterbirds. Conservation MNS sees to the effective management of existing protected areas as well as to establish new protected areas. MNS aims to secure an integrated and comprehensive Protected Area system in Malaysia and at the same time build a knowledge base of key habitats and species with the aim to disseminate this information to decision makers. Besides, MNS also identifies threats to the survival of habitats and species in the wild. The MNS Conservation initiatives are also guided by key documents such as the Important Bird Area (IBA) data which has been compiled since 1997 with the assistance of the MNS Bird Conservation Council and Birdlife International. Conservation is also guided by the MNS Blueprint for Conservation (established in 1974) which calls for the conservation of notable areas such as national parks, reserves, islands, national monuments, wildlife sanctuaries, marine reserves and research sites in Peninsular Malaysia. Education MNS runs a program of Nature Clubs (Kelab Pencinta Alam, KPA) for schools throughout Malaysia. It began with a pioneer group of 12 schools throughout the Klang Valley and today, its membership stands at 318 schools from all over Malaysia. The KPA programme aims to encourage interest, understanding and involvement in various environmental activities and conservation efforts amongst the school-going generation. There are some of special programmes held for KPA, for instances National Teachers Workshop, KPA camp and workshop, Peat Swamp study, Raptor Watch and School River Basin & Water Quality Monitoring. As the extension of KPA, MNS introduced the KPA for Youth programme which the main purpose for initiative is to encourage youth membership where MNS want to cultivate the sense of nature conservation through environmental activities involving youths and communities. Coca-Cola Malaysia first partnered Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) to develop the ‚ÄúWater Vision‚Äù program that aims to inculcate a sense of water conservation amongst youth. In addition, MNS runs education programs at Rimba Ilmu of the Universiti Malaya and at the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM). Parks and nature centres MNS's parks and centres include: #Kuala Selangor Nature Park #Nature Education Centre (NECs)in FRIM #Dark Caves at Batu Caves #ecoCare Centre in Kerteh #Environmental Interpretive Centre (EIC) in Sepang #Urban Environmental Education Hub in Midvalley Megamall #Boh Tea Estate chalet in the Cameron Highlands. Publications and communication MNS has the following periodical publications: # Malayan Nature Journal (MNJ) is the original MNS publication that has now become a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering ecology and conservation in Malaysia and the surrounding region. # Malaysian Naturalist (MN) is a quarterly magazine on the natural history of Malaysia that is free for members and is also sold at newsstands (). # Secretariat News is a supplement to the MN that is provided to MNS members. # Pencinta Alam is the Society's (free) monthly newsletter. # Suara Enggang is a bimonthly bulletin of the MNS Bird Conservation Council, focusing on interesting sightings and bird conservation issues. # Tapir is the quarterly bulletin of the MNS Kelab Pencinta Alam (KPA) school nature clubs. The MNS Conservation Publication series are a collection of reports and advisory papers. Logo The society logo is based on a Malayan Tapir. Under the IUCN Red List, the species is listed as endangered. The species is distributed in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, Thailand and Myanmar. Sightings have been recorded at other places such as deeper in the Indochina but such reports are unconfirmed.

Her writing is characterized by her use of a light conversational tone geared towards a young adult audience. She has published three series of novels and several short stories. Her works, Green Requiem and Neptune, received the Seiun Award for short story in 1981 and 1982.  Early life  Born in Tokyo in 1960, Arai expressed her creativity early on as a sophomore at Metropolitan High School of Igusa when she entered the science fiction magazine Kiso Tengai‚Äôs first competition for new writers. At age 16, she received an honorable mention and praise from prominent science fiction writer Shinichi Hoshi for her short story entry Inside Myself. Hoshi was a classmate of her father's and both of her parents were employees of Kodansha. Writing the entire story in the language of a contemporary teenage girl with minimal Kanji, Arai established a precedent for an emerging genre of shojo and young adult. Two years following the competition, Inside Myself was published in paperback form. Her novel, Hoshi e Iku Fune (A Ship to the Stars), was initially serialized in the K≈ç-1 Course magazine distributed to students in Japanese schools in 1981. The story details a young Japanese girl who stows away on spaceship disguised as her brother to escape the domestic pressures of home.  Green Requiem and later success  Arai‚Äôs most successful work, Green Requiem, was produced during her time at Rikkyo University where she studied German literature. An English translation was produced in 1984 by the Kodansha English Library. Green Requiem tells a star crossed love story between a green haired alien woman, Asuka Misawa and a human man, Nobuhiko Shimamura. Although Asuka attempts to live a life of normalcy by dying her hair black and working at a coffee shop, she is driven to suicide by the recurrence of the song of her mother. The novel questions traditional Japanese family values and a dependence on the past through Asuka's ultimate suicide. Green Requiem was also produced into a live action film directed by Akiyoshi Imazeki in 1988 and starred Eiji Okada and Shinobu Sakagami. Her short story, Please Open the Door was also developed into an anime in 1986. Her novel Black Cat, published in 1984, differed in genre from the rest of her work as a crime novel, but maintained the same youthful audience and tone as her other works. After her novels' initial successes, Arai began writing several sequels to A Ship to the Stars, Green Requiem, and Black Cat. As she and her audience grew older, Arai focused less on science fiction and fantasy and more on stories geared toward more adult subjects like marriage. In 1999, Arai returned to the science fiction genre with her novel, Tigris and Euphrates, which details a society's plan to populate a new world with artificially grown life. The plan goes awry and only one woman, Luna, remains, who decides to unfreeze the cryogenically frozen women. In a world without men, the women must learn to define new roles for themselves. The novel won the Japanese Science Fiction Grand Prize in 1999.  Legacy  Arai was one of the most prominent and popular authors in Japan during the 1980s. Her unique writing style has influenced many Japanese authors including Banana Yoshimoto and others producing work in the shojo genre. Arai has expressed her views on science fiction and its usefulness to society, stating in an essay in 2011 > Science fiction produces the kinds of stories that can ring an alarm bell to > the world...In fact, it has fulfilled that role for a long time now, SF, > Science Fiction. Serious science is at the very root of the genre, embedded > in its name. Thus scientifically minded writers sound a scientifically > grounded alarm bell to the world, in the form of entertainment. Arai is often credited with the popularization of the term otaku in Japanese popular culture through her use of it in her novels.

It may be distinguished from other stingrays in the area by its relatively elongated snout. This species is of little commercial importance, other than for sale in the aquarium industry. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Atlantic stingray was described by French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur as Trygon sabina, in an 1824 volume of the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He based his account on a damaged male specimen collected by American naturalist Titian Ramsay Peale during the Academy's 1817 expedition to Florida. Since then, various authors have included this species in the obsolete genera Pastinaca, Dasybatus (or the variants Dasibatis and Dasybatis), and Amphotistius, all of which were eventually synonymized with the genus Dasyatis. A 2001 phylogenetic analysis by Lisa Rosenberger, based on morphology, found that the Atlantic stingray is one of the more basal members of its genus. It is the outgroup to a large clade that contains, amongst others, the southern stingray (D. americana), the roughtail stingray (D. centroura), the longnose stingray (D. guttata), and the pearl stingray (D. margaritella). Distribution and habitat The Atlantic stingray is found over fine substrates. The Atlantic Stingray is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from Chesapeake Bay southward to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, to as far as Campeche, Mexico. Records of this species from Grenada, Suriname, and Brazil are doubtful and may represent other species. The Atlantic stingray is capable of tolerating varying salinities and can enter freshwater; it has been reported from the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, and the St. Johns River in Florida. The stingrays in the St. Johns River system represent the only permanent freshwater elasmobranch population in North America. This species inhabits shallow coastal waters over sandy or silty bottoms, estuaries, and lakes. They prefer water temperatures over and can tolerate temperatures over . These stingrays conduct seasonal migrations to stay in warmer water: they are only present in the northerly Chesapeake bay in the summer and fall, and elsewhere they migrate to deeper water in the winter. When inshore, they usually stay at depths of , and after migrating offshore they may be found as deep as . Description One of the smallest stingray species, the Atlantic stingray attains a maximum length of and a weight of . It has a spade-shaped pectoral fin disk 1.1 times as wide as long, with rounded corners and concave anterior margins. The snout is relatively long. There are three stout papillae on the floor of the mouth; the teeth are rounded, with a flat, blunt surface. During the reproductive season, the teeth of mature males change to feature long, sharp cusps that curve towards the corners of the mouth, for gripping onto females during mating. The tail is long and whip-like, with a serrated spine measuring a quarter of the width of the disk. The spine is replaced annually between June and October. Dorsal and ventral fin folds are present on the tail. Larger Atlantic stingrays develop tubercles or thorns along the midline of the back to the origin of the tail spine. Some larger females also develop tubercles around the eyes and spiracles. The coloration is brown or yellowish brown above, becoming lighter towards the margin of the disk and sometimes with a dark stripe along the midline, and white or light gray below. The tail fin folds are yellowish. In larger individuals the tail may be flecked with gray near the base and completely dark towards the tip. Biology and ecology A fetal Atlantic stingray The Atlantic stingray feeds mostly on benthic invertebrates such as bivalves, tube anemones, amphipods, crustaceans, and nereid worms, which they locate using their electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini. The exact composition of their diet varies by geographical location. When feeding, these rays will position themselves facing the current so that the sediment will be washed away. Numerous species of sharks, such as the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (Carcharhinas leucas), are major predators of the Atlantic stingray. In freshwater habitats, they may be preyed upon by American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). A known parasite of freshwater Atlantic stingrays is Argulus, a fish louse that feeds on skin mucus. Despite having a regular freshwater presence, the Atlantic stingray is physiologically euryhaline and no population has evolved the specialized osmoregulatory mechanisms found in the river stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae. This may be due to the relatively recent date of freshwater colonization (under one million years), and/or possibly incomplete genetic isolation of the freshwater populations, as they remain capable of surviving in salt water. Freshwater Atlantic stingrays have only 30‚Äì50% the concentration of urea and other osmolytes in their blood compared to marine populations. However, the osmotic pressure between their internal fluids and external environment still causes water to diffuse into their bodies, and they must produce large quantities of dilute urine (at 10 times the rate of marine individuals) to compensate. Like other stingrays, the Atlantic stingray is viviparous. Both marine and freshwater populations in Florida have an annual mating season from September or October to April, though ovulation does not occur until late March or early April. Courtship involves the male following the female and biting at her body and fins, and the male will grip onto the female's pectoral fin to assist in copulation. The embryos are sustained by a yolk sac until around day 60, after which they are nourished by uterine milk secreted by the mother (histotrophy). Litters of 1‚Äì4 young are born from late July to early August, after a gestation period of 4‚Äì4.5 months. Newborns measure wide. Marine males mature at a disk width of and females at a disk width of . Freshwater males mature at a disk width of and females at a disk width of . Human interactions If stepped on, the Atlantic stingray can inflict a painful, though rarely life- threatening wound. Large numbers of Atlantic stingrays are caught as bycatch in gillnets targeting flounder off North Carolina, but most are released alive. They are also caught as bycatch in small numbers in recreational and commercial trout gillnets, shark drift nets, and nearshore trawls. As there is no fishery targeting this species and bycatch mortality appears to be low, it was assessed as of Least Concern by the World Conservation Union. However, some localized freshwater populations have shown reduced health and reproduction due to declining water quality.

The game is a two-on-two versus third person shooter based on the system of the Mobile Suit Gundam VS Series. Each of the four players can be played by humans (either together locally or through netplay) or controlled by the computer. Each character has a choice of two to three different weapons, with vastly different properties. Actions such as dashing, guarding, jumping, or flying through the air are restricted by a \\"stamina\\" gauge ‚Äî once that gauge is depleted, none of the said actions can be carried out, though the gauge refills itself when it is not in use. Also, a \\"charge\\" and \\"main\\" gauge determine what kind of projectile the player fires, and how many he or she can fire. And finally, there is also a \\"limit gauge\\" that can be charged in one of two ways: when the player is damaged, or when the player deals damage. Once the gauge is full, the player can go into Hypermode and receive some stat bonuses for a limited period of time. The game ends when a team's balloon reaches a preset limit (default at 100%); the percentage increases when a team member's HP bar gets depleted. In the story mode, there are initially three storylines to go through, while more can be unlocked after the initial three has been played through. The teams are preset in the story mode, they are: *The protagonists team („Åì„Çå„ÅûÔºÅ‰∏ª‰∫∫ÂÖ¨„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Keiichi Maebara and Rena Ryuugu *The twin sisters team (Ëø∑ÊÉëÂèåÂ≠êÂßâÂ¶π„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Mion Sonozaki and Shion Sonozaki *The chibikko team (È†ëÂºµ„Çå„Å°„Å≥„Å£Â≠ê„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Rika Furude and Satoko Hojo *The lovers team (ÁÜ±ÊÑõ„Ç¢„Éô„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Jir≈ç Tomitake and Miyo Takano *The Okinomiya Police investigator team (ËààÂÆÆÁΩ≤ÁâπÂëΩÂàë‰∫ã„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Kuraudo ≈åishi and Mamoru Akasaka *The Hinamizawa School teachers team (ÈõõË¶ãÊ≤¢ÂàÜÊ†°ÂÖàÁîü„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Ky≈çsuke Irie and Rumiko Chie *The Sonozaki yakuza team (Ê≠¶ÈóòÊ¥æÂúíÂ¥éÁµÑ„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Akane Sonozaki and Tatsuyoshi Kasai *The club leader's private team (ÈÉ®Èï∑„Åï„ÇìÂÜÖÁ∑í„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Keiichi Maebara and Mion Sonozaki (expansion only) *Together with Nee-nee team („Å≠„Éº„Å≠„Éº„Å®‰∏ÄÁ∑í„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Satoko Hojo and Shion Sonozaki (expansion only) *Rena's take home team („É¨„Éä„ÅÆ„ÅäÊåÅ„Å°Â∏∞„Çä„ÉÅ„Éº„É†) - Rena Ryugu and Rika Furude (expansion only) Although the teams are preset in the story mode, a team can consist of any two characters in other matches. Plot In a peaceful day like any other, a small box was dropped on Rika Furude's head when she was sweeping in the Furude Shrine. In it was a pair of magatama, one red and one white. The magatama is actually the sacred treasure of the Furude Shrine. With its magical powers, the holder of the red magatama would unconditionally fall in love with the holder of the white one. Upon testing its effects on the school faculty, the club members of a Hinamizawa school decided that they should duel each other to see which pair gets to keep the magatama. In the beginning it was only an afterschool club activity, but their game eventually engulfed all of Hinamizawa. Characters The character settings are based on the original visual novels. Character selection screen in the expansion ; : *A balanced character with strong melee attacks and good ranged attacks. **Transfer student's bat: The bat offers an excellent range for melee attacks. Ranged attacks are basic but effective. **Invincible iron: The club ranged attacks have an explosion attribute, and are harder to dodge, but also harder to aim with them. **Evidence destructor shovel (expansion): The shovel specializes Keiichi on wide area attacks, which permits the player to cover more efficiently their partner with ranged attacks. ; : *Like Keiichi, Rena is a balanced character with no particular weak points. **Favorite cleaver: The cleaver is her standard playstyle, balancing both melee and range aspects. While she doesn't have the melee range or ranged damage output of Keiichi's bat, her melee attacks are stronger and faster. **Blade-split axe: The axe offers a brutal playstyle, though at the expense of her ranged attacks. She becomes specialized in disabling and wide area attacks, but with much less accuracy. **Ironclad cleaver (expansion): The huge ironclad cleaver drastically changes her gameplay. Because of the blade heaviness, she cannot cancel her attacks, moves rather slowly, dashes on the ground for a much shorter distance and drains her stamina bar quicker on aerial movements. However, her attack power is extremely powered up, while her defense power halves the damage she takes and also offers her some resilience on hit stun, much like Oyashiro Hypermode. Also, her voice changes to reflect her delusional state when wielding this blade. ; : *Mion is an agile ranged attack specialist, being weak in melee combat. **Dual wield pistols: The pistols gives a well balanced mix of firing speed, damage output, ammunition and reload speed. **Specially loaded water guns: The water guns are more powerful and deal a significant hit stun effect, but lack ammunition and have a slow reload speed. **Anti-riot water cannon (expansion): Much like the water guns, the water cannon is focusing Mion's playstyle on a more brutal and burst damage output at the expense of the hitstun, swapped with some knockback effect and recoil on herself. The projectiles are far less spread, focusing much more on straight and longer trajectories, with a much faster reloading and charging speed. ; : *Shion is fragile melee character, lacking of good melee range. However, her speed and agility balance her handicap very well. Unlike her sister, ranged attacks are not her forte. **Combat knives: Designed for her standard playstyle, the knives are suitable for hit and run tactics and for fast assault, along with swift ranged attacks. **Modified stun guns: the stun guns offer a slower but stronger style, along with some wide area of effect attribute. This weapon also has a very special hitstun, as the projectiles electrocute the targets. **Torture chamber whips (expansion): The whips give her more opportunity to deal with ranged characters and can harass high defense melee characters, as the hitstun completely incapacitates the target and can deal damage on knocked characters. ; : *Rika is a very slow and fragile character, lacking of melee options. However, she is extremely at ease whilst airborne, being a very versatile aerial fighter. **Ceremonial hoe: The hoe is her basic ranged attacks, using \\"all range\\" trajectories projectiles, with some good damage and explosion attributes. **Anti-cleaver girl mop: The mop is more specialized on widespread damage. The large energy attacks can bypass obstacles and buildings. **Scythe from the ritual tools shrine (expansion): The scythe changes her playstyle completely. While her defense is still a bit low, Rika has much better physical traits, being much more efficient on ground with much faster and stronger dash and melee attacks at the expense on her aerial abilities. While her ranged attacks aren't that powerful anymore, they are very efficient for any range with good damage, giving her a very nice balance between melee and ranged options. Much like Rena, this weapon changes her personality, being much more serious and cynical about fate and life. ; : *Satoko is a very unpredictable melee character, dealing surprise attacks with a flexible pattern, though the damage is very weak. To compensate this handicap, she has various and different options for any range. **Selected fireworks set: The fireworks deal moderate damage but the projectiles are fast and can create a huge barrage, considering the high amount of ammo and the quick reload speed. **Satoko's Trap Lecture: Her trap mode is unique since she has no range attacks in that mode, but she can set traps that does various kinds of damage to whoever on the opposing team that activates the traps. **Homing fireworks set (expansion): This set of fireworks are much more powerful, giving her some solid options to deal huge damage. Consequently, the amount of ammo and the reload speed are fairly inferior to the first fireworks set. The missiles have a serious explosion attribute, which are better for the damage aspect, but can be a double edged weapon as she can hit her partner or even herself in the process. ; : *Tomitake is a strong melee character, with a moderate range and a good defense. **Survival camera: The survival camera is rather unusual, playing with the line of sight of the opponents regardless the range between him and his target(s), with weak but very fast ranged attacks. Tomitake can also blind his opponents. **Spiritual camera: The spiritual camera is a standard weapon, giving him a usual and direct approach in ranged damage. **Submachine gun (expansion): The H&K; MP5 submachine gun is a versatile weapon, combining standard projectiles with his camera \\"sight attacks\\" and a unique melee dash attack. ; : *Takano is a support character, specialized in ranged damaging attacks. While she isn't exactly an autonomous ranged character, her support can be very effective, depending of her partner. **Toxic syringe: The syringes are her trademark playstyle, as Takano is dealing damage over time: set amount of damage, which follows up with a poison-like ailment that gradually decreases the victim's hit points. Note that the poison ignores completely the extra or minus defense of either character trait or buff (such like Hypermode and Match extra defense); which makes her the perfect (if not rigged) character against high defense opponents, but much less useful against low defense and agile characters. The poison cannot finish off a character with 0 hp, a direct attack is required in such instance. **Poisonous gas spray: Similar to the syringe, the gas spray uses the poison ailment, but in a widespread style with unpredictable projectiles, as their trajectories aren't straight forward. **Reinforcement transponder (expansion): The reinforcement transponder is suitable for hit and run tactics as the damage component is delayed, like her 2 previous poison modes. However, this approach deals direct damage instead, which is a more aggressive playstyle. ; : *≈åishi is a very tough character, having a very high attack and defense power. Consequently, his ranged options and speed are compromised in exchange. **Favorite handgun: Oishi's revolver gives him various versatile options, optimizing his chances to get his target in range. **Hyper arm: This \\"weapon\\" makes Oishi specialized on brute force: he is able to grab his opponent and use him/her as a projectile. A very effective playstyle against tough melee characters, but it makes him completely helpless in term of mid and long range. **The confiscatory (expansion): The confiscatory gives him the ability to randomly pick up a ranged weapon, which improves a lot his usually poor ranged abilities. ; : *Akasaka is similar to Keiichi, being balanced in melee and ranged attacks. Of course, he doesn't have the range, nor the swiftness of his youth counterpart, but has a higher attack power and a slightly better defense. **Secret book of energy attacks: Similar to Keiichi's bat, this book gives basic but efficient energy attacks. These projectiles are generally weaker, slower and longer to charge than Keiichi's baseballs, but they are larger and two simple energy attacks can be fired consecutively. In addition, all energy attacks have some homing effect and the full charged shot bounces to the other opponent if it connects with the first opponent. **Secret book of karate: This book specializes Akasaka in a more brutal melee playstyle, at the expense of the range and speed of his projectiles. The charged and full charged shots are actually strengthened punch, which are very powerful, but only on a straight line. **Secret book of setsuna (expansion): This book works like Karate, but with an innate ability: counterattacks which are effective against either melee or ranged attacks. This playstyle is much more strategic, but its stall and timed aspect can be a handicap against swift characters. ; : *Irie is another support character, specialized in status ailment ranged attacks. Much like Takano, Irie isn't exactly effective as a stand-alone character, but his teamwork is very effective. **Irie's deluxe medical treatment set: This first set deals low damage, but has the unique ability to heal his partner, whenever they are either hit by the projectiles or standing on the healing circles. It isn't required to aim the partner to heal them, as even stray projectiles will heal them. **Irie's deluxe hospitalization set: This second set deals good damage, and has the unique ability to reduce drastically the opponent attack power for a moderate period of time once charged completely. **Irie's deluxe support set (expansion): This third set deals average damage. Much like the two other sets, this one has a unique ability: boosting either the Attack or Defense power (or both) of your partner. The buffs duration can be extended, but the boost values are static. ; : *Chie is a fast and very agile character, having the largest combo moves set. Her movements resemble her model Ciel from Tsukihime. The reference is made more visible in the expansion, where Chie can wear a costume resembling those of Ciel's which, when worn, makes her talk like her Tsukihime counterpart. Like Ciel in Melty Blood, she cannot change directions when dashing. **Lecture-use T-square: This weapon gives to Chie some light but fast ranged attacks, resembling Ciel's trademark weapons, the Black Keys. This mode gives her the ability to deal with both opponents in melee and mid/long range. **Lecture-use compass: Much stronger, this weapon enhance a lot Chie's ranged abilities, at the expense of ammo and reload speed. **Lecture-use chalk (expansion): This weapon puts more emphasis on Chie's agile playstyle, giving more motion options. ; : *Akane is a very fast melee character, dealing great damage without having trouble to get close to an enemy. She has however a low defense and the \\"lag\\" between each melee attack make her approach a risk. **': The Mumei is very efficient in ranged attacks, giving her a good ranged support for her melee moves. **': The Tamahiki plays much more on melee playstyle. While Akane cannot deal with characters from afar due to the lack of projectiles, this weapon offers some support on her movements, making her approach easier. Much like how the name of the weapon suggests (lit. Shell Repeller), this weapon has the unique and innate ability to nullify any ranged attack if Akane hits the projectile with a good timing. **Iai katana (expansion): The Iai Katana is much more \\"brutal damage\\" based, with movements included, which gives more possibilities against high defense characters. This weapon is a great compromise between melee and mid-range situations. ; : *Tatsuyoshi Kasai is a tough ranged character. Despite his stiff and slow movements, his defense and arsenal give him the ability to outlast any standard ranged characters. **Shotgun: The shotgun is the fastest weapon among the three, dealing good damage on one or several targets. **Machine gun: The AK47 assault rifle is more \\"wide area attacks\\" based, with a better damage output, at the expense of ammo and reload speed. **Sniper rifle (expansion): The sniper rifle has the slowest consecutive shot lag, and the slowest reload speed. However, the damage dealt is above average, and can deal 100% damage (on a normal match setup) on a character if the projectile hits the opponent's head. This playstyle is much more stalling and tactical, though the lack of flexibility is a serious handicap without a good partner. ; : *Hany≈´ is a new character, added in the expansion, not available in the story mode. She is the character with the worst defense, which makes her extremely fragile against brutal characters and melee in general. However, her weapons are flexible enough to deal with her weakness. **God's World: This first power gives her the ability to reflect any projectile with magical barriers. She can also freeze her opponents briefly, which can stall them (especially their hypermode, since the freeze effect doesn't stop the hypermode drain). Her final ability is a complete Time stop, freezing everything except herself for several seconds; this move is actually a parody of the same abilities exhibited by two characters from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, namely the character Dio Brando; Hany≈´ even parodies one of his phrases when activating the technique. This weapon gives her the options to deal with both melee and ranged opponents and to support her partner as well. **': This second power gives her the ability to use energy attacks. It sets her playstyle into a more direct but ranged aspect. Onigari no Ry≈´≈ç has also a unique special trait: Any Hypermode will transform Hany≈´ into a serious and wrathful self and will reveal the true form of Onigari no Ry≈´≈ç: a sacred demon banishing sword. This \\"wrath mode\\" also doubles the usual duration of the hypermode, optimizing the effect of this state. This \\"fury state\\" gives her new melee and ranged attacks moves set and drastically increases her melee and ranged attack power. ; *Natsumi is a new character, added in the expansion, not available in the story mode. She is a swift melee character, more balanced in regards of defense, while her speed doesn't completely match Shion's. She has however much more problem to deal with ranged characters, as her ranged options are inferior than most melee characters. **Mother's kitchen knife: The knife is straight forward, giving an aggressive playstyle. This weapon however lacks of versatility in general. **Grandma's saw: The saw deal damage with weaker but consecutive blows with each melee attack, being effective against tough characters and super armor in general. This weapon specializes much more on melee wide area effects, which permits Natsumi to deal with 2 melee opponents at once. Expansion Cover to Higurashi Daybreak Kai The expansion, was announced and was released on April 22, 2007, in the convention Sunshine Creation 37.

The aid was predominantly in the form of food to alleviate starvation in the occupied areas. Germany Germany received GARIOA help between July 1946 and March 1950. In 1946, the US Congress had voted GARIOA funds to prevent \\"such disease and unrest as would endanger the forces of occupation\\" in occupied Germany. Congress stipulated that the funds were only to be used to import food, petroleum and fertilizers. Use of GARIOA funds to import raw materials of vital importance to the German industry was explicitly forbidden.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948\\", Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 101 At the time the US still operated under the occupation directive JCS 1067 which directed US forces to \\"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy\\". (see Industrial plans for Germany after World War II) In 1948 the combined US and UK expenditure on relief food in Germany stood at a total of close to $1.5 billion. Still, German food rations were deficient in composition and remained far below recommended minimum nutrition levels.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948\\", Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 107 Officials in authority admitted that the distributed rations \\"represented a fairly rapid starvation level\\".Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948\\", Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 107 The aid received by Germany through GARIOA was, just as the later Marshall Plan aid (starting 1948), charged to the Germans. By 1953 West Germany's combined GARIOA and Marshall Plan debt was over $3.3 billion. It was however decided in 1953 that West Germany only had to repay $1.1 billion. The amount was repaid by 1971. During 1945 private organizations such as the International Red Cross had been prohibited by the Allies from assisting ethnic Germans with food supplies, but in early 1946 this prohibition was rescinded (see CRALOG). In the spring of 1946, the International Red Cross was also finally allowed to visit and provide limited amounts of food aid to prisoners of war in the US occupation zone.Staff. ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands, 2 February 2005 (see Disarmed Enemy Forces).... Japan The first point in the US directive for the supply of food for civilian relief in Japan as adopted in the fall of 1945 and reconfirmed in 1946 read as follows: \\"a. The objectives of the relief policy of the United States are to prevent such starvation and widespread disease and civil unrest as would (1) clearly endanger the occupying forces, and (2) permanently obstruct the ultimate objectives of the occupation.\\"United States Department of State / Foreign relations of the United States, 1946. The Far East Volume VIII (1946) p.349United States Department of State / Foreign relations of the United States : diplomatic papers, 1945. The British Commonwealth, the Far East Volume VI (1945) p.731 To prevent \\"hunger and social unrest\\"; in fiscal year 1946 GARIOA grants to Japan were $92.63 million, in 1947 $287.33 million, in 1948 $351.40 million. In Western Europe the Marshall plan from 1948 onwards contributed to a reconstruction of the economies. In order to further remove Japan as a potential future military threat after World War II the Far Eastern Commission had decided that Japan was to be partly de-industrialized. The necessary dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved when Japanese standards of living had been reduced to those existing in Japan the period 1930‚Äì1934.Frederick H. Gareau \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 531(Note: A footnote in Gareau also states: \\"For a text of this decision, see Activities of the Far Eastern Commission. Report of the Secretary General, February, 1946 to July 10, 1947, Appendix 30, p. 85.\\") In the end the adopted program of de-industrialisation in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar US \\"industrial disarmament\\" program in Germany.Frederick H. Gareau \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 531 In view of the cost to American taxpayers for the emergency aid, in April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should be reconstructed. The report included suggestions for reductions in war reparations, and a relaxation of the \\"economic deconcentration\\" policy. For the fiscal year of 1949 funds were moved from the GARIOA budget into an Economic Rehabilitation in Occupied Areas (EROA) programme, to be used for the import of materials needed for economic reconstruction. Volunteer organizations created Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA) to coordinate their efforts and have a single point of contact with the military authorities which had refused to deal with them on a one-to-one basis. LARA was operational 1946‚Äì1952 and sent many tonnes of food and clothing to Japan.

The Druk White Lotus School is located in Shey, Ladakh, in northern India, and is known locally as the Druk Padma Karpo School. Karpo means White and Padma means Lotus in the local language Bodhi.  About  The school was started at the request of the people of Ladakh who wanted a school that would help maintain their rich cultural traditions, based on Tibetan Buddhism, while equipping their children for a life in the 21st century. The masterplan and school buildings, designed by architects and engineers from Arup Associates and Ove Arup & Partners, combine local building techniques and materials with leading edge environmental design to make them effective in the extreme climate. In 2012, landscape architects from the School of Architecture, Design and Construction at the University of Greenwich began work on a landscape master plan and garden for the DWLS School. The school offers a broad education, initially in the Ladakhi language and English. Residential blocks allow children from Ladakh's remote areas to attend, and a programme of sponsorship ensures that the poorest are not excluded. It is managed by the Druk Pema Karpo Educational Society and financed with money raised internationally. Druk White Lotus/Padma Karpo school is being built in stages. The Nursery and Infant Courtyard opened in September 2001, and the Junior School in November 2004. Middle and Secondary School facilities were built year by year as funds permitted, with the last two secondary school classrooms completed in 2014. Additional facilities for residential students and the school are ongoing.

It was subsequently on the metre gauge Alipurduar-Bamanhat-Golokganj line. When Assam Link Project constructed the link through North Bengal, it used the longer New Jalpaiguri‚ÄìAlipurduar‚ÄìSamuktala Road line.

There were two stations Pateswari and Sonahat which were in Bangladesh, these functioned even after partition. However, the collapse of the rail-cum-road bridge over the Gadadhar in the seventies ended that link.

He lived in the reign of the Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. This puts him in the late 2nd century CE (Aurelius and Verus reigned from 161 to 180). Cornelianus acted as secretary (ab epistulis Graecis) to Marcus Aurelius. The grammarian Phrynichus Arabius speaks of Cornelianus with high praise; Phrynichus dedicated his Ecloga to him, and describes him as worthy of the age of the great orator Demosthenes.Cf.

This remains the intention today. Without a good working dog, the shepherd's work on both the hills and the lowlands would be impossible. It seeks to achieve this by, amongst other things, managing the registration of dogs in its stud book. The International Sheep Dog Society was founded in 1906, with the purpose of \\"improving the shepherd's dog\\". In the early years, the ISDS (as it is generally known) was centered in the Scottish Borders, but over the years it has grown to be truly international. An annual \\"International\\" sheepdog trial, has been held every year since 1906, with breaks only for the two World Wars and the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak. In 1922, National trials were set up in England, Scotland and Wales to find a national champion for each country and act as qualifying trials for the International trial. Ireland (comprising North, South and the Isle of Man) joined in 1961 to complete the set of four home nations. However, further expansion was to come. The International trial was international in that it was a competition \\"between nations\\", but because of the rules governing quarantine for dogs entering or reentering the UK, an all world competition wasn't possible, even though sheepdog trials, many of them using dogs bred in the UK, were taking place in many countries using ISDS rules and judged by ISDS judges, including the Continental (European) trial, which is held annually with ISDS encouragement and support. The first World Trial took place in Bala, North Wales, in 2002, and is now held every three years. It is a wonderful opportunity for people from all over the world with a similar interest to meet and see the best sheepdog handlers the world has to offer, always in a breathtaking setting. But the ISDS is not only about sheepdog trialling. The ISDS Stud Book was set up in the late 1940s and remains in invaluable list of working sheepdogs and their progeny. Knowledge of how a dog is bred is essential for anybody wanting a dogs from a working strain and looking for certain characteristics. The ISDS has also sought to work with the veterinary profession to eradicate genetic defects in the Border Collie such as CEA (Collie Eye Anomaly) and PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) through careful breeding and through the use of DNA tests. There are over 300,000 entries in the Stud Book, and thousands of new entries are added every year, either on the basis of parentage or if a dog has proved itself to be a good working example (\\"Registered on Merit\\"). The ISDS also promotes the training of young sheepdog handlers through a number of practical methods, some farm based, some competitive. The ISDS has several thousand members all over the world, currently enjoying the membership rights, which include the popular bimonthly magazine International Sheepdog News. Details can be found on the ISDS website at www.isds.org.uk to which there is a link below. The structure of the International Sheep Dog Society is thus: Members from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales all elect up to ten Directors annually, who meet an annual meeting. From those Directors, members of the ISDS Council are elected annually, and it is the Council which is the ISDS governing body, the Council members acting as the Trustees of the ISDS, which is a registered charity. Each of the four home nations has elected Junior and Senior Vice Presidents and a National President. The Chairman of the ISDS is also elected, and as well as chairing meetings, each Chairman has been at the forefront of advancing the Society and in determining policy. The day-to-day administration of the ISDS is in the hands of the Chief Executive (until 2001 going under the title of ISDS Secretary), who is based at the ISDS office in Bedford, where the administrative staff carry out the day to day tasks involved in what over the last 103 years has become a sizeable organisation.

The school has two campuses in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria; one at Bundoora; the other, eight kilometres away at Preston. The school was founded by four Christian Brothers in January 1871. They had taught for two years in a small school behind St Francis‚Äô Church in Lonsdale Street before moving into the bluestone building in Victoria Parade, East Melbourne. The school's official name was CBC East Melbourne but it was generally known as Parade College. About one hundred boys enrolled on the first day and this number grew steadily over the years. This building was affectionately known as the \\"Old Bluestone Pile\\" and the school song takes its name from this building. Eventually in 1953 it became necessary to move the junior classes to a site newly acquired by the Old Paradians Association at Alphington. In 1968 further expansion was necessary and the college moved to a site of on Plenty Road, Bundoora. The old school premises in East Melbourne were taken over by Cathedral College (this school closed in 1995). In 1988, the junior classes at Alphington were moved to Bundoora and all three campuses occupied the spacious grounds large enough to give each campus its own recreational areas. In 2009 Parade opened a second campus in Preston. This had formerly been a long- established school, Marist College Preston which had been renamed Redden College before becoming Samaritan Catholic College. This new campus of Parade Years offers 7‚Äì9 classes as well as the Year 10 Edmund Rice Pathways Program and Year 11 VCAL studies. Today, the college has almost 1900 students in Years 7‚Äì12 across both the Bundoora and the Preston campuses. The four houses of the school are named after the founding Brothers: Treacy (Yellow), Hughes (Blue), Bodkin (Red) and Lynch (Green). The school is a member of the Associated Catholic Colleges. Its \\"old boy\\" association is the Old Paradians. The school's sporting colours are purple, green and blue, which also feature in the lyrics of the school war-cry.

The film was a casting coup in that Chiranjeevi, who was an action hero, was cast as a bumbling private detective in a full-length comedy. The film received critical acclaim and is considered be a classic film. Plot Panduranga \\"Pandu\\" Rao is an amateur detective employed at Universal Detective Agency in Visakhapatnam, which is run and managed by Ramachandra Murthy. He considers James Bond as his idol, and models himself after him in terms of appearance and gives himself the name \\"James Pond\\". Neither the police nor his colleagues take Pandu seriously, including his assistant Ganapathi and the local police inspector Saumitri. Pandu harbours feelings for Jwala, a self-employed telephone cleaner. She considers him as a good friend, but does not take his professional abilities seriously. Once, Jwala visits the house of a businessman to clean his telephone, but finds herself holding a hand gun instead of telephone receiver. She is accused of killing the businessman and theft of diamonds he possessed. Pandu takes up the case, but is interrupted by Murthy, who was appointed by the police to help them as a detective. Pandu refuses to give up and continues to investigate unofficially. Meanwhile, Jwala's friend Nischala, a surgeon, arranges her release on bail. As a part of his investigation, Pandu calls Jwala to his office for an interrogation, which goes horribly wrong. However, Pandu gets to know that Jwala spotted a chocolate brown-coloured Maruti car parked outside the businessman's house on the day of murder. He notices Murthy using a similar car and contacting jewellers outside Visakhapatnam. Pandu grows suspicious, and spies on Murthy with Saumitri's help. They eventually catch Murthy confessing his crime to a jeweller and arrest him. Pandu is subsequently appointed as the head of Universal Detective Agency. Upon Jwala's recommendation, Nischala approaches Pandu with a case: to find her missing half brother who was nicknamed Chantabbai (younger one). Chantabbai was born to Nischala's father Gangadharam and his love interest Sharmishta out of wedlock. Gangadharam was later coerced to marry Nischala's mother, who managed to keep them apart until her demise. With Gangadharam's health deteriorating severely, Nischala wants to bring Chantabbai before him and make him happy. Pandu takes up the case and finds that Gangadharam's friend Ramkoti took care of Sharmistha and Chantabbai for a while. Upon investigating, Pandu learns that Ramkoti had two sons Kalyan and Pattabhi, and favoured the former more. Pandu concludes that Kalyan is Gangadharam's son and introduces him to the family. Days later, Pattabhi comes to Gangadharam's house and claims himself as Chantabbai. Pandu finds himself challenged with the outcome and tries several ways to deduce the real heir. All of them fail due to several loopholes, but the results of a blood test manipulated by both makes Pandu believe that both of them are fraudsters. Gangadharam expels both from his house, and the brothers swear revenge. Meanwhile, Pandu and Jwala fall in love and plan for their marriage. One day, Pandu learns from Nischala that Chantabbai's aunt Bala has arrived to Visakhapatnam for a family function. Pandu goes to meet Bala and learns that his mother was the Sharmistha whom Gangadharam loved. Realising that he is Chantabbai, Pandu recalls the hardships he faced as a child and how he was ostracized by the society for his illegitimate origins. Pandu refuses to return to Gangadharam's place as his son, unless the share of wealth he would inherit be donated to the orphanage he runs in the city. Nischala agrees to the condition and mediates. Meanwhile, Kalyan and Pattabhi kidnap Pandu and demand ransom from Gangadharam. Pandu sens a letter explaining his plight and requests to save him. However, Ganapathi notices number '1' written on the sheet and starts reading the first letters of the message together; they reveal an instruction to tell the kidnappers that he is not the real heir to Gangadharam. Gangadharam executes the plan, and Pandu leads the brothers to a house. There, they notice Gangadharam playing cards with his friend, and proceed to kidnap him. However, Saumitri enters the scene and arrests them. The film ends with Gangadharam accepting Pandu as his son, and his marriage with Jwala. Cast  Soundtrack  Soundtrack is composed by K.

Entry on Hipponicus III a wealthy Athenian. She was married c. 424 BC or earlier Her father died at the Battle of Delium that year to the prominent Athenian statesman and general Alcibiades. Life According to Plutarch, who is however criticized for using \\"implausible or unreliable stories\\" in order to construct Alcibiades' portrait,D. Gribble, Alcibiades and Athens, 30 Alcibiades \\"gave a box on the ear to Hipponicus, whose birth and wealth made him a person of great influence.\\" This action received much disapproval, since it was \\"unprovoked by any passion of quarrel between them\\". To smooth the incident over, Alcibiades went to Hipponicus's house and, after stripping naked, \\"desired him to scourge and chastise him as he pleased\\". Hipponicus not only pardoned him but also bestowed upon him the hand of his daughter.Plutarch, Alcibiades, 8 According to another version of the story, according to Plutarch, is that it was not Hipponicus, but Callias, his son, who gave Hipparete to Alcibiades, with a dowry of ten talents. Then, \\"when she became a mother, Alcibiades exacted another ten talents besides, on the plea that this was the agreement, should children be born. And Callias was so afraid of the scheming of Alcibiades to get his wealth, that he made public proffer to the people of his property and house in case it should befall him to die without lineal heirs.\\"Wikipedia entry on Callias III says: \\"The family was immensely wealthy: the major part of their fortune came from the leasing of large numbers of slaves to the state-owned silver mines of Laurium. In return, the Calliases were being paid a share of the mine proceeds, in silver. Accordingly they were considered the richest family in Athens and possibly all of Greece, and the head of the family was often simply referred to as \\"ho plousios\\" (Greek: \\"Œø œÄŒªŒøœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ\\", \\"the wealthy\\")\\". The father Hipponicus (slain at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC)was married to the woman who later married Pericles; the grandfather Callias II was a cousin of Aristides the Just. Hipparete's mother is not known; she may have been the woman who later married Pericles, or may have been a later wife of Hipponicus III. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she once attempted to divorce him, because Alcibiades consorted with courtesans. According to Plutarch, on her appearing publicly to support her plea for divorce to the magistrate, as the law required, \\"Alcibiades came up and seized her and carried her off home with him through the market place, no man daring to oppose him or take her from him\\". She lived with him until her death and gave birth to probably two children, a daughter and a son, also named Alcibiades.

Avalon produces a wide range of steel-string acoustic guitars.  History  The company, \\"Avalon Guitars Limited\\", was originally formed in 1989 as The Lowden Guitar Company Limited and operated from Bangor, County Down until 1990. From 1989 until 2003, Avalon produced approximately 15,000 Lowden acoustic guitars and for a brief period from 1992 to 1996 also produced a solid body electric bass guitar under the name Goodfellow. The Goodfellow brand was sold to the Shinseido Corp. of Japan in 1996 to allow the company to focus exclusively on making high quality handmade acoustic guitars using traditional methodology. The workshops in Newtownards were purpose built to facilitate the traditional approach to luthiery adopted by Avalon (then Lowden Guitar Co.); the facility was laid out in the pattern of specialised Japanese guitar makers by the then Technical Manager Mitsuhiro Uchida - now one of Japan's foremost luthiers. Uchida also trained the apprentice luthiers, several of whom went on to develop their own guitar design talents which contributed significantly to the development of Avalon Guitars. Due to limitations in the design licence agreement relating to Lowden Guitars, none of the company's luthiers were permitted to contribute design ideas to the development of the company's product range. To rectify this situation, the company created the Avalon Guitars brand in 2000 and invited design input from the group of the most experienced guitar makers working for the company at that time. The new range, called the Avalon Gold series, was launched in 2002. The first reviews of the range (Guitarist magazine (UK), April 2002; Guitar Buyer magazine (UK), June 2002; Total Guitar magazine (UK), June 2002) highly commended the range for its build quality and tonal excellence. In 2012, Avalon announced that it would be going into liquidation. The newly formed Avalon Guitar Company was the feature of a photography essay by David Cleland in 2013 with the images being used by a number of publications. See the photo essay here.  Product developments  In response to the mass market development in guitar manufacturing made possible by advances in wood working technologies such as CNC, laser cutting and UV lacquer curing, the company designed and introduced a mass market version, named the Avalon Silver series and built in Korea. Production of the Avalon Gold series was momentarily transferred to Furch Guitars facility in the Czech Republic to allow Avalon's luthiers to concentrate exclusively on high end custom acoustic guitars. Meanwhile, it was reported in the UK's Guitar & Bass magazine in 2006 that the Avalon Guitars luthiers in Ireland were making the very high-end Zemaitis acoustic guitars Avalon discontinued all offshore produced models in 2007 to concentrate exclusively on making high-end handcrafted acoustic guitars from its workshop in Northern Ireland.

Gabe Cazares, who was the mayor of Clearwater at the time, used the term ‚Äúthe occupation of Clearwater.‚Äù Original (huge) (PDF, 18M), 1980 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting History In the 1970s the Church of Scientology Corporation used a front group called the \\"United Churches of Florida\\" to purchase the Fort Harrison Hotel for $3 million. The church established their headquarters in the Fort Harrison Hotel and dubbed it their Flag Land Base. A 1977 FBI raid on Scientology headquarters uncovered internal Church of Scientology documents marked \\"Top Secret\\" that referred to their secret operation to take over Clearwater as \\"Project Normandy.\\" The document itself states its purpose is \\"to obtain enough data on the Clearwater area to be able to determine what groups and individuals B1 will need to penetrate and handle in order to establish area control.\\" The document says its \\"Major Target\\" is \\"To fully investigate the Clearwater city and county area so we can distinguish our friends from our enemies and handle as needed.\\" On 3 November 1979, the Clearwater Sun ran an article with the headline \\"Scientologists plot city takeover\\" and later stories claimed that the Scientologists also had international plans to take over the world. The St. Petersburg Times won a Pulitzer Prize for one of their stories that exposed some of the criminal wrongdoings of the Church of Scientology. Cazares also noted that he found it odd that a religious group would resort to using code names for a project to take control of a town, and called the project a \\"paramilitary operation by a terrorist group.\\"Gabe Cazares video interview for a Clearwater historical society.

According to the band's official website, the group formed in August 1989. The founding members --consisting of Joe Ewers, Fred Ewers, John Frayler, Dave Goss and Bob Beeman-- were amateurs who played a variety of 19th-century instruments, including banjo, bones, drum, fiddle, guitar, and tambourine. They began by playing informally during re-enactment campaigns. They eventually moved to playing dances and concerts. Today, the roster comprises seven members, including players of the fife, flute, and pennywhistle. The 2nd South Carolina String Band has released six albums through Palmetto Productions. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has featured their music in his films Mark Twain and Jazz. The band appears in the film Gods and Generals, directed by Ronald F.

As a designer of siege machinery he was recommended by Maurice of Nassau, later Prince of Orange, through whose efforts Gerbier arrived in London in 1616, in the train of the Dutch ambassador. In London he soon found a patron in George Villiers, 1st Duke of BuckinghamGerbier's letter introducing himself to Buckingham with a calligraphic flourish survives in the Bodleian Library (MS Tanner 73). for whom he found paintings and negotiated their purchase,His account presented in 1621 to the then marquis of Buckingham, in buying pictures in Italy and arranging their perilous transport, often rolled up in baize cloth and wrapped in waterproof cerecloth then boxed in cases that had to be carried by mule- train and even on porters' backs across an Alpine pass between Turin and Lyon, was discussed and printed by I.

At York House and at New Hall, Gerbier was busy with architectural alterations for Buckingham, 1624-25. At York House, a visit from Inigo Jones while the paving was being laid in the grande chambre reveals Gerbier's intense competitiveness with the Surveyor of the King's Works, whose apparent jealousy of what he saw at York House gave Gerbier undisguised delight.Colvin 1995, following Gerbier's letters to Buckingham in the Bodleian. York Water Gate survives in Embankment Gardens With Buckingham and Prince Charles (the future Charles I), Gerbier was a member of the ill-fated diplomatic party that travelled to Madrid in connection with the Spanish Match. In Madrid Gerbier painted a portrait of the Infanta that was returned to London for the approval of James I. On a similar mission in Paris in 1625 he met his fellow countryman, diplomatist and courtier, Peter Paul Rubens, with whom he developed a close friendship; when Rubens went to London in 1629, it was with Gerbier that he lodged. Rubens' portrait of Gerbier's family is in the Royal Collection, Windsor.Sir Balthazar Gerbier was also painted by Sir Anthony van Dyck. When Rubens died in 1640, Gerbier was in Antwerp and sent an inventory of his collection to Charles. The king inherited Gerbier after Buckingham's assassination (1628) and employed him as resident agent in Brussels, a difficult post (1631‚Äì1641)\\"I have completed here nine years, remained my best time, and spent much in misery,amongst men who do not understand themselves, much less others, who may not give account of their actions to their own sovereign\\" (Gerbier to Peter Paul Rubens, 3 April 1640 O.S., translated by William Noel Sainsbury, Original Unpublished Papers Illustrative of the Life of Sir Peter Paul Rubens London, 1859:218f). He is regarded as being a member of the \\"Whitehall Group\\" a term used by Oliver Millar in a magazine article in 1956 and subsequently in a 1958 book. to describe those associated with Charles I who introduced a taste for Italian old masters to England. While in Brussels as the English agent, Gerbier conspired with Flemish nobles to overthrow their Spanish governors and then sold the secret of the conspiracy to the King of Spain.Cuvellier and Lefevre eds., Correspondance de la Cour d'Espagne (1927) King Charles never found out and Gerbier was knighted in 1638 and appointed Master of Ceremonies, in charges of the royal \\"shows and entertainments\\" but was disappointed not to receive Inigo Jones's post of Surveyor of the King's Works. His court appointment put him in contact with the Lord Treasurer, Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, for whom Gerbier advised on the construction of a house and garden at Putney Park, Roehampton, Surrey, which was demolished in the eighteenth century (Colvin). For the same patron he supervised the equestrian statue of Charles the First, now at Charing Cross. Deborah Kip, wife of Balthasar Gerbier, and her children (Peter Paul Rubens, 1629-1630) A political feud soon led to Gerbier's replacement in 1641, followed by a couple of decades during the Civil War and the Commonwealth in which he improvised a living, ventured a banking scheme in France, made a gold-hunting venture to Guiana, kept a painting academy in Bethnal Green, and allied himself to Cromwell and his republican government, with a profession of loyalty to the Parliamentarians in 1642-43British Library, Add. Mss 32093, noted by Colvin 1995. and a dedication to Lord Fairfax of a lecture on military architecture (1650), In 1653 he published an account of the evil effects on sovereigns of wicked and pernicious favourites.Gerbier, Balthazar (1653), Les effects pernicieux de meschants favoris et grands ministres d'Estat Es provinces Belgiques, en Lorraine, Germanie, France, Italie, Espagne, & Angleterre., The Hague In 1660 he published A sommary description manifesting that greater profits are to bee done in the hott then in the could [sic] parts off the coast off America . . . Here he advocated the enslavement of Africans as a means of increasing profits for investors as a) slaves are cheaper to maintain, and b) Africans work twice as hard as Christians. To the point that it is ‚Äúnot Christian-like to use rational creatures in that quality‚Äù he argues firstly that Africans brought directly from Africa had already been enslaved by other Africans, and had thus lived under the ‚ÄúSlavery off the Devil.‚Äù Furthermore, he argues, by being introduced to the society of Christians their lives are improved as they are changed changed ‚Äúas from brutes into rationals‚Äú. With the Restoration, his suit for reinstatement as Master of Ceremonies was turned away, and he had to retreat into anonymity when the designs for the temporary triumphal arches for Charles II's coronation were engraved; Colvin notes that J. Ogilvie's Relation of His Majestie's entertainment passing through the City of London to his coronation with a description of the triumphal arches (1661, 2nd ed. 1662) credits the design of the arches to Peter Mills \\"and another Person, who desir's to have his name concealed\\", whom Colvin surmises to have been the disgraced Gerbier, who refers to them in his Brief Discourse (1662). Colvin notes similarities with Rubens' designs for the royal entry of the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand into Antwerp, 1635 (published 1642), with which Gerbier would have been familiar. In the 1660s Gerbier's necessities induced him to advertise himself by publishing some essays on architecture: A brief Discourse concerning the Three Chief Principals of Magnificent Building (1662) and Counsel and Advise to all Builders (1663). He was commissioned to rebuild Hampstead Marshall, Berkshire, for William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608‚Äì1697), but died there, with the structure still in the works: the piano nobile had not yet been begun. It was completed by Captain William Winde, but suffered a disastrous fire in 1718 (Colvin).

Deformation styles Development of Riedel shears in a zone of dextral shear Flower structures developed along minor restraining and releasing bends on a dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip fault Riedel shear structures In the early stages of strike-slip fault formation, displacement within basement rocks produces characteristic fault structures within the overlying cover. This will also be the case where an active strike-slip zone lies within an area of continuing sedimentation. At low levels of strain the overall simple shear causes a set of small faults to form. The dominant set, known as R shears, form at about 15¬∞ to the underlying fault with the same shear sense. The R shears are then linked by a second set, the R' shear that form at about 75¬∞ to the main fault trace. These two fault orientations can be understood as conjugate fault sets at 30¬∞ to the short axis of the instantaneous strain ellipse associated with the simple shear strain field caused by the displacements applied at the base of the cover sequence. With further displacement the Riedel fault segments will tend to become fully linked, often with the development of a further set of shears known as 'P shears', which are roughly symmetrical to the R shears with respect to the overall shear direction, until a throughgoing fault is formed. The somewhat oblique segments will link downwards into the fault at the base of the cover sequence with a helicoidal geometry.Ueta, K.; Tani, K. 2001. Ground Surface Deformation in Unconsolidated Sediments Caused by Bedrock Fault Movements: Dip-Slip and Strike-Slip Fault Model Test and Field Survey. American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2001, abstract #S52D-0682 Flower structures In detail many strike-slip faults at surface consist of en echelon and/or braided segments in many cases probably inherited from previously formed Riedel shears. In cross-section the displacements are dominantly reverse or normal in type depending on whether the overall fault geometry is transpressional (i.e. with a small component of shortening) or transtensional (with a small component of extension). As the faults tend to join downwards onto a single strand in basement, the geometry has led to these being termed flower structure. Fault zones with dominantly reverse faulting are known as positive flowers, those with dominantly normal offsets are known as negative flowers. The identification of such structures, particularly where positive and negative flowers are developed on different segments of the same fault, are regarded as reliable indicators of strike-slip.Harding, T.P. 1990. Bulletin American Association of Petroleum Geologists. 74 Strike slip duplexes Strike slip duplexes occur at the step over regions of faults, forming a lens shaped near parallel arrays of horses. These occur between two or more large bounding faults which usually have large displacement. An idealized strike-slip fault runs in a straight line with a vertical dip and has only horizontal motion, thus there is no change in topography due to motion of the fault. In reality, as strike slip faults become large and developed, their behavior changes and becomes more complex. A long strike slip fault follows a staircase-like trajectory consisting of interspaced fault planes that follow the main fault direction. These sub parallel stretches are isolated by offsets at first, but over long periods of time they can become connected by step overs in order to accommodate the strike slip displacement. In long stretches of strike-slip the fault plane can start to curve, giving rise to structures similar to step overs. Right lateral motion of a strike slip fault at a right step over (or overstep) gives rise to extensional bends characterised by zones of subsidence, local normal faults, and pull apart basins. On extensional duplexes, normal faults will accommodate the vertical motion, creating negative relief. Similarly, left stepping at a dextral fault generates contractional bends; shortening the step overs which is displayed by local reverse faults, push-up zones, and folds. On contractional duplex structures, thrust faults will accommodate vertical displacement rather than being folded, as the uplifting process is more energy efficient. Strike slip duplexes are passive structures; they form as a response to displacement of the bounding fault rather than by the stresses from plate motion. Each horse has a length that varies from half to twice the spacing between the bounding fault planes. Depending on the properties of the rocks and the fault, the duplexes will have different length ratios and will develop on either major or subtle offsets, although it is possible to observe duplex structures that develop on nearly straight fault segments. Because the motion of the duplexes may be heterogeneous, the individual horses can experience a rotation with a horizontal axis, which results in the formation of scissor faults. Scissor faults exhibit normal motion at one end of the horse and a thrust motion at the other end. Because strike slip duplexes structures have more horizontal motion than vertical motion, they are best observed on a map rather than a vertical projection, and are a good indication that the main fault has a strike slip motion. An example of strike slip duplexes were observed in the Lambertville sill, New Jersey. Flemington and the Hopewell faults, the two main faults in the region, experienced 3 km of dip slip and over 20 km of strike slip motions to accommodate regional extension. It is possible to trace the lensoidal structures which are interpreted as horses that form duplexes. The lens structures observed in the 3M quarry are 180 meters long and 10 meters wide. The main duplex is 30 m in length and other smaller duplexes are also present. Geological environments associated with strike-slip tectonics San Andreas Transform Fault on the Carrizo Plain Areas of strike- slip tectonics are associated with: Oceanic transform boundaries Mid- ocean ridges are broken into segments offset from each other by transform faults. The active part of the transform links the two ridge segments. Some of these transforms can be very large, such as the Romanche fracture zone, whose active portion extends for about 300 km. Continental transform boundaries Transform faults within continental plates include some of the best known examples of strike-slip structures, such as the San Andreas Fault, the Dead Sea Transform, the North Anatolian Fault and the Alpine Fault. Lateral ramps in areas of extensional or contractional tectonics Major lateral offsets between large extensional or thrust faults are normally connected by diffuse or discrete zones of strike-slip deformation allowing transfer of the overall displacement between the structures. Zones of oblique collision In most zones of continent-continent collision the relative movement of the plates is oblique to the plate boundary itself. The deformation along the boundary is normally partitioned into dip-slip contractional structures in the foreland with a single large strike-slip structure in the hinterland accommodating all the strike-slip component along the boundary. Examples include the Main Recent Fault along the boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates behind the Zagros fold and thrust belt,Talebian, M. Jackson, J. 2004. A reappraisal of earthquake focal mechanisms and active shortening in the Zagros mountains of Iran Geophysical Journal International, 156, pages 506‚Äì526 the Liqui√±e-Ofqui Fault that runs through Chile and the Great Sumatran fault that runs parallel to the subduction zone along the Sunda Trench. The deforming foreland of a zone of continent-continent collision The process sometimes known as indenter tectonics, first elucidated by Paul Tapponnier, occurs during a collisional event where one of the plates deforms internally along a system of strike-slip faults. The best known active example is the system of strike-slip structures observed in the Eurasian plate as it responds to collision with the Indian plate, such as the Kunlun fault and Altyn Tagh fault.Tapponnier, P. & Molnar, P. 1979.

One day, while delivering a basket of groceries, Peyton encounters the smugglers and is made prisoner. He is bound and led to an attic room. Struggling desperately with his bonds, Peyton manages to secure a small pocket mirror from his pocket and flashes a heliograph message to the revenue cutter down the bay. Meanwhile, Marcella, who has been expecting Peyton to call, becomes alarmed at his absence, knowing that he has recently had an altercation with Poole. She warns her cousin, Ben, and by making inquiry, they learn where the officer was seen last. Peyton is discovered in the attic window by Ben, who climbs the porch and assists the officer to escape. Hearing the disturbance, the smugglers take to flight and when the cutter comes steaming up the river in response to Peyton's message, the officer, together with Marcella and Ben, is taken aboard.

It is very efficient in hardware implementations and was designed by Chae Hoon Lim of Future Systems Inc. The CRYPTON algorithm processes blocks of 128 bits in the form of 4√ó4 byte arrays. The round transformation consists of four steps: byte-wise substitution, column-wise bit permutation, column-to-row transposition and finally key addition. CRYPTON uses 12 rounds of this encryption process. Due to the algorithm's nature, the decryption process can be made identical to the encryption process using a different key.

The company was founded in a 60-foot trailer in 1967 by brothers Peter Harken and Olaf Harken. Originally, the brothers manufactured sailboats under the name Vanguard and kept the hardware business separate so they could sell to competing boatbuilders. Gary Comer, founder of Lands' End clothing company, advised and helped them distribute their first blocks by placing them in the Lands' End catalogue. In 1986, Vanguard Sailboats was spun off to Stephen Clark in Rhode Island so that the brothers could focus on hardware. Harken hardware has been a dominant force in the racing segment for many years, making its Olympic and America's Cup debuts in 1976 and 1977, respectively. Harken's primary manufacturing plants are the Pewaukee headquarters and the Italian office in Limido Comasco, Como. Harken has sales and service offices in USA (Rhode Island, California, Florida), France, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Geography  Enoggera is north-west of the Brisbane CBD. The west of the suburb is dominated by Enoggera Hill. History Aboriginal history The word Enoggera is a wrongly spelled by an error made at the Government Lands Office, when the letter u was mistaken for n. It was intended that the name should be recorded as Euogerra, a contraction of the Turrbal phrase youara- ngarea meaning literally \\"sing-play\\" or song and dance. It refers to a ceremonial site used for dancing. It is said to have first applied to a site near the mouth of Breakfast Creek. It is possible, however, that the name was independently applied to a site at the place at presently known as Enoggera.Watson, 1944. page 105 They named the area near Bancroft Park \\"Bu-yu- ba\\", which means, \\"straight shin bone\\", referring to a straight stretch of creek.Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland. St Lucia, Queensland: University of Queensland Press. 1992. p.11. .Tram Stops September OCtober 2004 Volume 2 Number 5. Ashgrove Historical Society. Enoggera is a corruption of Yowogerra, which in Turrbal means corroboree. Because this area was given a distinct name indicates that it held a significant place in Turbull culture as a camping and corroboree region.  19th Century  In 1845, John Brennan purchased six hectares of land in Enoggera. Six years later, Thomas Hayes moved to the area and bought thirty-three acres of land. Enoggera initially developed as a farming community with orchards and vineyards. In the 1860s, the track to the Gympie goldfields passed through Enoggera, and this assisted with development. As the population increased, the first school opened in 1871, and the railway line to Enoggera Station opened in 1899. In 1887, the local government Division of Enoggera was proclaimed, bound to north and south by Kedron Brook and Enoggera Creek, and stretching from Alderley to The Gap and beyond the Enoggera Dam. Enoggera became a shire in 1903 before being amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. In 1890, an advertisement was published to auction the Blackheath Estate, being re-subdivisions of part of portion 190, County of Stanley, Parish of Enoggera, by E. Hooker & Son Auctioneers. In 1890, re-subdivisions 1 to 17, of subdivision 24 of portion 190, County of Stanley, Parish of Enoggera, were advertised for auction by W. J. Hooker.  20th Century  The land for the Enoggera Army Barracks was acquired in 1910, and opened in the same year. The barracks is still operation but now known as Gallipoli Barracks. St Mary's Anglican Church was dedicated circa 1911. It closed circa 1987. On Saturday 15 May 1915 there was a stump capping ceremony for a new Presbyterian church at Enoggera. The location was on the corner of Pickering Street and Station Avenue (), now within Gaythorne. In 1926 the church was extended to create a Sunday school. As part of the merger of many of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches into the Uniting Church of Australia in 1977, the church became Gaythorne Uniting Church. However, falling congregation numbers led to a consolidation of Uniting churches in the area, leading to the closure of the former Presbyerian church. Since 2012, it has been used as an early education centre. alt= In May 1919, subdivided allotments of Rangeview Estate Enoggera were auctioned by Cameron Bros. This area is now within the suburb of Gaythorne. The map advertising the auction states that the Estate was within 5 minutes' walk away from the Rifle Range Railway Station, now known as Gaythorne Station. In April 1921, the land unsold in the previous auction was re-auctioned as \\"Gaythorne & Rangeview Estates\\" made up of 53 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros. In July 1920, subdivided allotments of Elswick Estate Enoggera were auctioned by Isles, Love, and Co. The map advertising the auction depicts the estate‚Äôs proximity to the Enoggera Railway Station, and describes the land as having ‚Äúbeautiful grassy park-link ridges‚Äù and ‚Äúlovely foliage trees‚Äù. The map further states that a water main passes through the estate and that there would be a good prospect of trams and electric light extension. In 1925. Derby Estate, which was once owned by Tim Corbett, was bordered by Laurel Street, Elkhorn Street, Derby Lane, and Clover Street. In December 1927, 31 blocks in Abbotsford Estate Enoggera were advertised for auction by Isles, Love & Co. Limited Auctioneers. The map advertising the sale states the land for sale is resubdivisions 1 to 32 & (Easement A) of subdivision 2 of resubdivision 2 of subdivision 3 of portion 406 & of subdivision 2 of portion 407, Enoggera. The map depicts the close proximity of Abbotsford Estate to the Enoggera Railway Station. In 1949, the tram line from Newmarket was extended along Samford Road to Enoggera. The tram line closed on 2 December 1968.

Hongchang was born in Fugou, Henan province. He started his military career in 1913 under General Feng Yuxiang. He was the commander of the 22nd Army when he was appointed as Ningxia chairman. Refusing to attack the Red Army led by the Communist Party while the whole country was threatened by Japan, he was sacked by Chiang Kai-shek and ordered to \\"observe and study\\" abroad. He returned to China in 1932. In May 1933, he helped to organize the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army together with Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu and directed it along the front line against the Japanese invaders. The army recovered the Japanese-controlled Duolun (now in Inner Mongolia) and built nationwide confidence to fight against the Japanese. In October, the People's Army was extinguished, by Chiang Kai-shek who mobilized sixteen divisions against them. Ji Hongchang fought on for a while before seeking asylum in Tianjin's foreign concessions in January 1934. Chiang's policy to \\"extinguish the outlaws (the Communists) before fighting against invaders\\" disappointed him. As a result, he joined the Communist Party in March 1934. On April 24, Ji established the \\"Great Anti-Fascism Alliance of Chinese People\\" in Tianjin, with Feng Yuxiang, and Fang Zhenwu. Kuomintang agents injured Ji Hongchang in an assassination attempt on Nov 9th, and colluded with French police in extraditing Ji Hongchang for execution in Peking on Nov 24th. Before his death, Ji reportedly asked his executioner for a chair, citing that he was a patriot fighting Japanese invaders and therefore should neither be kneeling nor falling when he dies, as well as demanding to be shot from the front, as he wanted to \\"see how the enemy's bullet kills me\\".

Life Early life and conversion Maria Elizabeth Hesselblad born on 4 June 1870 as the fifth of thirteen children born to August Robert Hesselblad and Cajsa Petersdotter Dag ‚Äì Lutheran parents from F√•glavik in V√§stra G√∂taland County; she had a brother: Thur. She was baptized the following month and received into the Lutheran Church of Sweden in her parish of Hudene. By 1886, she had to work to help them make ends meet. At first she looked for work in Sweden, but eventually emigrated to the United States of America in 1888, where she studied nursing at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. While there, she did home nursing, which brought her into contact with the Catholic faith of many of the poor for whom she cared. She developed an interest in that faith while deep prayer and personal study led her down the path of conversion, and on 15 August 1902 ‚Äì the Feast of the Assumption ‚Äì she received conditional baptism from a Jesuit priest, Johann Georg Hagen, in the chapel of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in Washington, D.C. Hagen also became her spiritual director. As she reflected on that moment, she wrote: \\"In an instant the love of God was poured over me. I understood that I could respond to that love only through sacrifice and a love prepared to suffer for His glory and for the Church. Without hesitation I offered Him my life, and my will to follow Him on the Way of the Cross\\". Two days later, she received her First Communion and would depart for Europe. Hesselblad approached Hagen and asked that she be received into the Church at once to which Hagen said: \\"My dear daughter, how could I do that? I have just met you\\". She said: \\"My father, forgive me, but I have fought in darkness for twenty years; for many years I have studied the Catholic faith and have prayed for a strong faith ... I now possess this faith, and I am ready to submit to an examination on all the points of doctrine\\". Hagen questioned this, and after great consideration told her: \\"I see no reason not to receive you unto the Church. Today is August 12, and the 15th will be the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. That day, I will receive you into the Catholic Church; the following Sunday, the 17th, you will be able to receive Holy Communion. Spend these few days in retreat and come to see me twice a day for lessons\\". It was in that same year that her brother, Thur, converted to Catholicism. As a religious Canonization Mass on 5 June 2016. Hesselblad then made a pilgrimage to Rome, where she received the sacrament of Confirmation. She also visited the house of Bridget of Sweden there, where Bridget had spent the last half of her life, which made a deep impression upon her. At that point she felt called to dedicate her life to the work of Christian unity. She returned to New York City briefly, only to go back to Rome, where, on 25 March 1904, she was welcomed as a guest by the nuns of the Carmelite monastery housed there; Mother Hedwig ‚Äì the prioress ‚Äì welcomed her after hesitating to accept her due to her weak health. However, she allowed her on the condition of a period of probation. Yet it was at this point she fell gravely ill and even had to receive the Extreme Unction. She slowly recovered and held out against her family's pleas to return to Sweden. She petitioned the Holy See to be able to make religious vows under the Rule of the Order which Brigid had founded, and had been a prominent presence in the Church in Sweden before the Protestant Reformation had taken hold there. She received special permission for this from Pope Pius X in 1906, at which time she assumed the Bridgettine religious habit, including its distinctive element of a silver crown. She professed into the hands of Hagen on 22 June 1906, the Feast of the Sacred Heart. Hesselblad attempted to revive interest in the order and its founder in both Sweden and Rome. Her proposal to establish a monastery of the order on the site where Bridget had lived received no volunteers from the few monasteries of the order still in existence. Giving up on the intention of following the established way of life in the order, she proposed one which included the care of the sick. To this end she was joined by three young women from England, whom she received on 9 November 1911, with which the new congregation was established. Their particular mission was to pray and work, especially for the conversion of the Scandinavian people to the Catholic Church. Hesselblad returned to her homeland of Sweden in 1923, where she was able to establish a community in Djursholm, while she worked nursing the sick poor. The new congregation was established in England in 1931 after receiving the approval of the Holy See.The Bridgettine Order ‚Äì UK History. Accessed 19 December 2015. That same year, Hesselblad obtained the House of Saint Bridget in Rome for her new congregation. A foundation was made in India in 1937 which drew many new members. Her order received canonical approval on 7 July 1940. Hesselblad became known as \\"the second Bridget\\". During World War II ‚Äì and after ‚Äì she performed many charitable works on the behalf of the poor and those that suffered due to racial laws and also promoted a movement for peace that involved Christians and non-Christians, and she became part of their journey to faith and to the Church. The war also saw her save the lives of Jews who would have otherwise perished in the Holocaust had it not been for her direct intervention. Her apostolic zeal contributed to the conversion of the Baptist minister Piero Chuminelli ‚Äì author of a biographical account of Bridget of Sweden ‚Äì and she also had close ties to the former Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel Zolli (Eugenio) who converted to the faith in 1946. Death Her health declined around the time when officials prepared the canonical visit of her order. On 23 April 1957 she gave her blessing to the sisters and held her raised hands in a solemn gesture in which she murmured: \\"Go to Heaven with hands full of love and virtues\\". She received the sacraments thereafter. Hesselblad died in Rome on 24 April 1957 in the first hours of the morning ‚Äì it was Easter Wednesday. Sainthood Process and beatification The sainthood process commenced in Rome in 1987 and concluded its work in 1990. During this period the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause and her being granted the title of Servant of God on 4 February 1988 ‚Äì the first official stage in the process. The diocesan process was ratified on 21 June 1991 which allowed for the submission of the Positio to Rome for further investigation. Theologians granted the cause their approval on 10 November 1998 while the C.C.S. approved it also on 16 March 1999. Pope John Paul II proclaimed her to be Venerable on 26 March 1999 after he recognized that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle requested for her beatification was investigated in 1996 and received ratification in Rome on 17 October 1998. The pope approved it at the beginning of 2000 allowing for her beatification on the following 9 April 2000. Canonization Pope Francis approved the second miracle attributed to her on 14 December 2015 which would allow for her future canonization; the date was decided at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on 15 March 2016 and was celebrated in Saint Peter's Square on 5 June 2016.Pope Francis Sets Canonization Date For Mother Teresa: Sept. 4 The miracle was investigated in the diocese of its origin in Cuba in February 2014 ‚Äì the miracle in question occurred in the late 2000s ‚Äì and was validated in Rome on 20 June 2014. A medical board approved the miracle in April 2015.

An animal rights activist, she addresses the way in which people exploit animals and the environment through the repurposing and remodelling of vintage taxidermy, a process she calls \\"de-taxidermy\\". Since the 1990s her work has been exhibited both in New Zealand and internationally.  Education  Singer graduated in 2002 from the Elam School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland with an MFA. She lives with her partner, artist Daniel Unverricht, in Wellington, New Zealand.  Art  Since the mid-1990s, Singer's art has explored the human and non-human animal relationship, driven by her concern with the ethical and epistemological consequences of humans using non-human life, and the role that humans play in the exploitation and destruction of animals and our environment. Singer sees the boundaries separating other species from humans as permeable. She sculpts in various media including modelling clay, wax, fibre, ceramics, gemstones, and vintage jewelry, as well as wool and silk. Many of her sculptural works combine mixed media with vintage taxidermy. Singer is known for working with vintage hunting trophy taxidermy, which she recycles into new sculptural forms to explore the human/animal divide. She calls this practice ‚Äúde-taxidermy‚Äù, a process which involves revealing the wounds inflicted on the animal, wounds that are obscured by the taxidermy process and its attempted \\"rescue from time\\". Singer incorporates into her work some of the history of the death of the animal, which she obtains from those who give her the vintage taxidermy. Like Karen Knorr, Singer uses old hunting trophies or vintage taxidermy that natural history museums have thrown away. Some of the trophy taxidermy Singer uses is found discarded in dumpsters and garbage piles. Curator Jo-Ann Conklin writes: > A number of artists in the exhibition react to human treatment of animals > and the environment. New Zealand artist and animal activist Angela Singer > rails against trophy hunting. Her latest work, Spurts (2015), depicts a > decapitated deer with cartoony yet still gruesome bubble-gum pink ‚Äúblood‚Äù > spurting from it neck. Mark Dion‚Äôs Concrete Jungle (1993) is‚Ä¶the detritus of > our contemporary consumer culture ‚Äî a pile of discards and garbage in which > animals attempt to survive.  Activism  Singer is an artist and an animal advocate. Like other artists such as Sue Coe, she is concerned with the ethics of using live animals in art. She will not work with living animals or have living creatures harmed or killed for her art. In the early 1990s she worked with the animal rights group Animal Liberation Victoria, Australia (ALV) antivivisection campaign. A quote from Singer, regarding her use of taxidermy as an art form: > I think using taxidermy is a way for me to honour the animals‚Äô life, because > all the taxidermy I use was once a trophy kill. ... The very idea of a > trophy animal is sickening to me. She is not related to Peter Singer, the animal rights activist and philosopher.  Exhibitions  * Curious Creatures & Marvellous Monsters.

History The barracks were constructed in 1820-1821 as cavalry barracks for the Life Guards and the Royal Artillery as part of John Nash's original design for Regent's Park. Nash had originally intended the barracks to be situated in the northern area of the park, well away from the residential area, and separated from the rest of the park by Regent's Canal. However Nash's plan was not accepted in its entirety by the Crown with one of the changes involving a change in the location of the barracks to its present site. In 1848, the barracks were described in the Topographical Dictionary of England: :The cavalry barracks in Albany-road are neatly built of brick, and occupy an area of eight acres and a half; the buildings comprise accommodation for 400 men, with stabling for their horses, a riding-school, infirmary, magazine, and an extensive ground for exercise. The barracks in 1904 Originally designed to house 450 officers and men and 400 horses the barracks were almost entirely rebuilt between 1891 and 1893. The rebuilding followed the original general layout, and carried out under the supervision of Colonel R. Athorpe. The layout comprises a complex of buildings arranged around a parade ground. The only building to survive from the original barracks is the Officers' Mess which was built between 1820 and 1821 and is situated on the east side of the parade ground. Other buildings at the northern end of the site include the Gothic chapel which was built in 1857 and the hospital which was built in 1877. Three parallel blocks used for soldiers' accommodation and stables, service buildings and the riding school were all built in 1891. From 1896 to 1969, the Royal Horse Guards were based there, which later became part of the Blues and Royals. On 24 September 1971 an anarchist group called the Angry Brigade bombed the barracks in response to Operation Banner, the British Army's presence in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Current units Today the barracks are the home of 20 Logistic Support Squadron, Royal Logistic Corps, 21 Special Air Service Regiment (Artists) (Reserve) and the regimental headquarters of the Queen's Royal Hussars, as well as the Queen's Royal Hussars Collection Trust charity. Popular culture The music hall singer Ida Barr, whose real name was Maud Barlow, was born in the barracks on 17 January 1882, the daughter of a corporal-major in the Life Guards. In H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, there is a mention of the barracks: \\"the sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks\\".

Description the lingum Khori means cave (Guffa) and Shiv Khori thus denotes Shiva's cave. This natural cave is about 200 metres long, one metre wide and two to three metres high and contains a self made lingam, which according to the people is unending. The first entrance of the cave is so wide that 300 devotees can be accommodated at a time. Its cavern is spacious to accommodate large number of people. The inner chamber of the cave is smaller. The passage from outer to the inner chamber is low and small, at one spot it divides itself into two parts. One of these is believed to have led to Kashmir where Swami Amarnath cave is located. It is now closed as some sadhus who dared to go ahead never returned. To reach the sanctum sanctorum, one has to stoop low, crawl or adjust his body sideward. Inside a naturally created image of Lord Shiva, about 4 metres high, is visible. The cave abounds with a number of other natural objects having resemblance with Goddess Parvati, Ganesha and Nandigan.

History Formerly, a grant- maintained school, La Sainte Union Catholic School is now a voluntary-aided school which teaches girls aged 11‚Äì18. It is a Specialist Science College. It was awarded Beacon school status in 1999. The school is a part of the LaSWAP Sixth Form consortium, together with William Ellis School, Acland Burghley School and Parliament Hill School. As such, although the main student body is female, the school has a mixed sixth-form. The school is named after the order of sisters that founded and continues to run the school, the Sisters of La Sainte Union des Sacr√©s-Coeurs (also known as the Holy Union Sisters). This teaching order was founded in 1826 by Father Jean-Baptiste Debrabant, a Belgian priest who felt that the future of the Catholic Church lay in the hands of the young women who would eventually bring up future generations of the faithful, declaring that \\"a Christian-based education offers sure hope for the future of religion and society\\".Report on the school by the Archdiocese of Westminster The school site is on Highgate Road/Croftdown Road, opposite Parliament Hill Fields. It was originally a small private boarding school, becoming a grammar school in the 1960s, and then a comprehensive in the 1970s. During the 1990s the school had grant-maintained status. It was one of the first schools in London to be named as a Beacon school in a government scheme designed to recognize outstanding achievement in inner-city schools. The school in 2004 been awarded specialist school (science ) status., and High Performing Specialist School status in 2008. The school was recognised as a good school by Ofsted in 2010, and confirmed as such in a Section 8 inspection in 2019. LaSWAP Sixth Form The LaSWAP Sixth Form is the sixth form consortium of four North London schools: Acland Burghley School, La Sainte Union Catholic School, Parliament Hill School and William Ellis School. It is one of the largest sixth form consortia in the Greater London area offering some 42 different AS and A2 courses, AGCEs, BTECs, NVQs and GCSE courses.

The equivalent system for computer-simulated video is known as virtual reality. With FTV, the focus of attention can be controlled by the viewers rather than a director, meaning that each viewer may be observing a unique viewpoint. It remains to be seen how FTV will affect television watching as a group activity. History Systems for rendering arbitrary views of natural scenes have been well known in the computer vision community for a long time but only in recent years has the speed and quality reached levels that are suitable for serious consideration as an end-user system. Professor Masayuki Tanimoto from Nagoya University (Japan) has done much to promote the use of the term \\"free viewpoint television\\" and has published many papers on the ray space representation, although other techniques can be, and are used for FTV. QuickTime VR might be considered a predecessor to FTV. Capture and display In order to acquire the views necessary to allow a high-quality rendering of the scene from any angle, several cameras are placed around the scene; either in a studio environment or an outdoor venue, such as a sporting arena for example. The output Multiview Video (MVV) must then be packaged suitably so that the data may be compressed and also so that the users' viewing device may easily access the relevant views to interpolate new views. It is not enough to simply place cameras around the scene to be captured. The geometry of the camera set up must be measured by a process known in computer vision as \\"camera calibration.\\" Manual alignment would be too cumbersome so typically a \\"best effort\\" alignment is performed prior to capturing a test pattern that is used to generate calibration parameters. Restricted free viewpoint television views for large environments can be captured from a single location camera system mounted on a moving platform. Depth data must also be captured, which is necessary to generate the free viewpoint. The Google Street View capture system is an example with limited functionality. The first full commercial implementation, iFlex, was delivered in 2009 by Real Time Race. Multiview video capture varies from partial (usually about 30 degrees) to complete (360 degrees) coverage of the scene. Therefore, it is possible to output stereoscopic views suitable for viewing with a 3D display or other 3D methods. Systems with more physical cameras can capture images with more coverage of the viewable scene, however, it is likely that certain regions will always be occluded from any viewpoint. A larger number of cameras should make it possible to obtain high quality output because less interpolation is needed. More cameras mean that efficient coding of the Multiview Video is required. This may not be such a big disadvantage as there are representations that can remove the redundancy in MVV; such as inter view coding using MPEG-4 or Multiview Video Coding, the ray space representation, geometry videos, etc. In terms of hardware, the user requires a viewing device that can decode MVV and synthesize new viewpoints, and a 2D or 3D display. Standardization The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has normalized Annex H of MPEG-4 AVC in March 2009 called Multiview Video Coding after the work of a group called '3DAV' (3D Audio and Visual) headed by Aljoscha Smolic at the Heinrich-Hertz Institute.

He was also associated with the monastic reformer √Üthelwold, bishop of Winchester, he is also notable for being involved in a number of land transactions for the refounding and endowment of Peterborough Abbey, as well as with Thorney Abbey during the 970s and early 980s. Family connections It is thought that he married the daughter of Ealhhelm, ealdorman of central Mercia, and hence that he was brother-in-law to √Ülfhere, ealdorman in Mercia between 956 and 983.Williams, \\"Princeps Merciorum gentis\\", p. 147. Her name may have been √Üthelfl√¶d.Williams, \\"Princeps Merciorum gentis\\", p. 147 (note 21). Her brother √Ülfheah, ealdorman in Wessex, left a will \\"probably drawn up in the late 960s\\" in which he bequeathed estates to √Ülfwine, his \\"sister's son\\", who was probably √Ülfric's son with her.S 1485 This √Ülfwine is also thought to be the warrior of this name who died fighting in the battle near Maldon (Essex, 991), according to the Old English heroic poem which was composed to commemorate the event (The Battle of Maldon). It has been suggested that it may have been √Ülfric Cild who in 956 received from King Eadwig land at Hanney and who is addressed as the king's adoptivus parens in the charter which records the transaction.S 597 The description has been interpreted as indicating that √Ülfric had married into a family of royal rank and possibly that he \\"had a hand in raising the young Eadwig\\".Jayakumar, \\"Eadwig and Edgar\\", p. 85. In some contemporary as well as later sources, √Ülfric (a common Old English name) is distinguished by his cognomen Cild. Literally meaning \\"child\\", it is an Old English title borne by some Anglo-Saxon nobles and typically denotes a man of high rank.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, p. 138 note 7. √Ülfric appears to have been a wealthy landowner in Huntingdonshire, East Anglia, hence in the ealdormanry of √Ülfhere's great rival √Üthelwine. √Ülfric Cild and √Üthelwold The sources for √Ülfric's landed possessions associate him with Bishop √Üthelwold's monastic reform in East Anglia. One of them is a charter, dated 973, which purports to confirm the acquisition of various estates by Bishop √Üthelwold for the refoundation of Thorney Abbey. Although the charter is spurious in its present form, it is nevertheless thought to preserve an authentic core.S 792Thacker, \\"√Üthelwold and Abingdon\\", p. 54. The text reports that √Ülfric, called miles, sold Water Newton, Huntingdonshire, to √Üthelwold for 20 librae of silver. Although he initially contested the alleged outcome of the transaction, he consented on accepting from the bishop a further amount of silver (13 librae) as well as some land at R√¶sen (possibly Market Rasen, Lincolnshire) and Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire. √Üthelwold also acquired part of Yaxley from √Ülfric. Another religious house re-established by √Üthelwold was Peterborough Abbey. A list of sureties dating from √Ülfric's time as ealdorman (983 x 985) suggests that it, too, acquired some of √Ülfric's lands.S 1448a √Ülfric is also found in the company of Bishop √Üthelwold on other occasions. The Liber Eliensis specifies that the meeting of King Edgar at which Bishop √Üthelwold bought land at Gransden, was attended by √Ülfhere, √Üthelwine and √Ülfric Cild.Liber Eliensis 2.46 According to the same source, √Ülfric was joining √Üthelwold, bishop of Winchester, the young √¶theling √Üthelred, \\"then an earl [comes]\\", and his mother Queen √Ülfthryth when they were doing business at Ely Abbey sometime in the reign of King Edward the Martyr (975-978). The text remembers these years as a time \\"when the government of the kingdom was in disorder and the legal tenure of the land disrupted\\".Liber Eliensis 2.11 √Ülfric's presence may indicate that he belonged to a faction which supported √Üthelred's claims to the throne, one which included Bishop √Üthelwold.Jayakumar, \\"Reform and Retribution\\", p. 349. Ealdorman of Mercia (983-985) √Ülfric is associated with √Ülfhere in a number of local transactions. Sometime between 971 and 980, √Ülfric witnessed a charter, issued in the absence of the king, which records that √Ülfhere sold land to Ordgar, abbot of Abingdon.S 1216. The Liber Eliensis names √Ülfhere, √Üthelwine and √Ülfric Cild as those present at a local council which was held at Slaughter, Gloucestershire sometime after King Edgar's death. This council dealt with a dispute about land at Hatfield.Liber Eliensis 2.7. See Williams, \\"Princeps Merciorum gentis\\", p. 165. When √Ülfhere died in c. 983, √Ülfric was appointed ealdorman in his place.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle s. a. 983 The office was a powerful asset since under √Ülfhere's tenure, its sphere of authority had grown to include not only central Mercia, but also parts of Mercia formerly controlled by ealdormen √Üthelmund and √Üthelstan Rota, that is, western Mercia (from Cheshire to Gloucestershire) and Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.Williams, \\"Princeps Merciorum gentis\\", pp. 164-66 √Ülfric was not able to retain his new position for very long, however. Early in the year 985, a royal council was convened at Cirencester and √Ülfric was driven out of the country on account of treason.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle s.a. 985; the meeting at Cirencester and the charge of treason are mentioned in S 937. The nature of the accusation is unknown, but it may be related to allegations that he had appropriated estates in Gloucestershire from a widowed matrona called Eadfl√¶d, possibly √Ülfhere's widow. These allegations are known from two royal diplomas which were issued around the turn of the century in favour of Abingdon Abbey.S 896 (AD 999); S 937 (AD 999?). The charters record the donation of her lands to Abingdon Abbey during the reign of King √Üthelred. In one of King √Üthelred's so-called 'restitution charters', ealdorman √Ülfric and Wulfgar, bishop of Ramsbury, are singled out as greedy men whose bad counsel had misled the king into violating the privileges of Abingdon Abbey, such as the right to elect its own abbot. √Ülfric is said to have bribed the king and so to have bought the abbacy for his brother Eadwine.S 876 There is some uncertainty among historians as to whether this √Ülfric, who is described as maior domus regis by the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis (History of Abingdon Abbey), refers to √Ülfric Cild or to √Ülfric, ealdorman of Hampshire (d. 1016).Historia Ecclesie Abbendoniensis, cxxiii and ch. 96.Wiliams, \\"Princeps Merciorum gentis\\", p. 171 note 138.Kelly, Charters of Abingdon Abbey Part 1, cxii. After 985 It is not known when √Ülfric died or what became of him in exile. The cartulary- chronicle Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis written in the 12th century claims that he left for Denmark, assembled a band of Viking soldiers and returned to attack England. However, the text may have confused √Ülfric Cild with his namesake, ealdorman of Hampshire, as it has done elsewhere. √Ülfric's son appears to be the √Ülfwine who died fighting in the Battle of Maldon in 991. In the Maldon poem, he is portrayed as a young man in the personal household troop of Byrhtnoth, ealdorman of Essex, who led the fateful attack against the Viking army and in the event, perished himself. Following Byrhtnoth's death and the flight of several of his men, a speech is attributed to √Ülfwine in which he urges his fellow warriors to remember the heroic boasts they made at the drinking table and exhorts them to avenge their lord, against all odds. √Ülfwine is expressly identified as a son (bearn) of √Ülfric, but in his speech, he is made to identify himself as a grandson of Ealhhelm (wis ealdorman) as well as a kinsman (m√¶ge) of Byrhtnoth.The Battle of Maldon, lines 209-24.Stafford, \\"Kinship and women in the world of Maldon\\", pp. 225-6. The next ealdorman known to have been given responsibilities in Mercia is Leofwine (d. 1016), who received the office in 994. It has been suggested that in the interim when the position of ealdorman remained vacant, √Üthelsige, a king's thegn, may have been given \\"some position in Mercia\\".Williams, √Üthelred the Unready, p. 66 Notes References Secondary sources     Primary sources * Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (MSS C, D and E), tr. * The Battle of Maldon, ed. * Anglo-Saxon charters, listed by number assigned in the Sawyer catalogues: ** S 1485 (c. 968 x 971), will of ealdorman √Ülfheah. ** S 792 (dated AD 973), spurious charter for Thorney Abbey. ** S 1216 (AD 971 x 980), √Ülfhere selling land to the abbot of Abingdon ** S 1448a (AD 983 x 985): list of sureties for estates of Peterborough Abbey ** S 876 (AD 993), confirmation of privileges to Abingdon Abbey ** S 896 (AD 999) and S 937 (AD 999?) * Liber Eliensis 2.7 (=Libellus √Üthelwoldi 5, concerning Hatfield); 2.11 (=Libellus √Üthelwoldi 12, concerning Downham); 2.46 (=Libellus √Üthelwoldi 57, concerning Gransden) ** ed. ** tr. *  External links  * ; see also , Category:Anglo-Saxon ealdormen Category:Anglo-Saxon warriors ","title":"√Ülfric Cild"},{"id":"7237373","text":"√Ülfric was Ealdorman of Hampshire from to 1016. √Ülfric succeeded ealdorman √Üthelm√¶r to the county of Hampshire and possibly Wiltshire in about 982. √Ülfric was among the leading advisers of King √Üthelred and was described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'one of those in whom the king trusted most'; this is perhaps seen in 991 when, along with √Üthelweard and Sigeric, he advised the king to pay the Danes for peace, which he did. Though one of the king's most trusted men, √Ülfric in 992 defected to a Danish fleet that he was supposed to attack. Though his defecting ship was captured, he escaped. However, his family suffered for this act, as √Üthelred had his son √Ülfgar blinded the year after (993). √Ülfric was at some point reconciled with √Üthelred, since the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has him fighting for the English in 1016, but in 1003 he supposedly pretended to be sick in order to avoid leading an army from Wiltshire and Hampshire against Sweyn Forkbeard, who was allowed to pillage Wilton. √Ülfric died in the Battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016 fighting for Edmund Ironside. In a charter from 993 √Ülfric was censured for buying the abbacy of Abingdon for his brother Eadwine and encouraging the king to alienate the abbey's lands to laymen, among whom his son √Ülfgar should probably be numbered.

Durban North lies between the N2 freeway and the eastern seashore, with the Umgeni River forming its southern boundary. Its residential suburbs are some of Durban's most affluent . It is flanked by La Lucia in the north.  History  In 1927 the Durban North Estates Company, a property development company, bought a large tract of land north of the Umgeni River known as the Prospect Hall Sugar Estate.City of Durban Report on the planning of Durban North - C.G. Hands City Engineer, Durban, March 1975 Plans were laid out for the development of the land into a residential suburb, and roads were built, beginning with Northway, to be the main arterial through the new suburb. At the time access to the land across the Umgeni was limited to the Connaught Bridge further upstream. In November 1927 the company completed the iron girder Athlone Bridge across the Umgeni River to link the new suburb at Northway to the established area of Stamford Hill in the South. Following the completion of the bridge and enhanced access to the city, Durban North rapidly developed, followed by Virginia in the 1950s, and Glenashley in the 1970s. Location and Suburbs Briardene, Red Hill and Glen Anil are its main industrial areas. Its more affluent residential suburbs include Glen Anil, Glen Ashley, Glen Hills, Virginia, Greenwood Park, Effingham and LaLucia. Park Hill, Umgeni Park, Avoca, Kenville and Sea Cow Lake are further South of Durban North. Chris Hani Road is the main industrial arterial in Durban North, abutting Briardene and Glen Anil industrial areas.

He is best known for the around 120 songs he recorded throughout 17 years from 1951 together with Gunnar Engedahl. They met at the Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted, and made their first hit as a duo in 1951, produced by Odeon. Erling Stordahl claimed the family line of Norway's King Magnus the Blind. His cultural leadership continued after his recording career. He raised the money to found the Beitost√∏len Health Sports Center, for the handicapped children and adults of Europe, in one evening telethon, a part of the Norwegian Red Feather campaign. He also founded the Stordahl Center for Art and Culture, and presided as chair of the United Nations' International Year for the Handicapped. The yearly Ridderrennet at Beitost√∏len in Norway was also established by Erling Stordahl. When Ridderrennet traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, Stordahl inspired the blind cross country skier Diane Ziegler, who founded the Association for Blind Living and Education (ABLE), Out of Sight Clubs, and celebrity fashion shows for the blind and sighted. Stordahl's approach to recreation for the handicapped was also a model for the Sons of Norway Ski for Light program brought to the United States by Olav Pedersen.

A native of Los Angeles, California, Lomax graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

In 1975, she started working for the Los Angeles County Counsel's office, defending county agencies in labor and civil matters. She founded her own firm in 1984, specializing in age, sex and racial discrimination cases. Appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, Lomax was the first black woman to lead the Los Angeles Police Commission, which she headed when motorist Rodney King was beaten by four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. She won many friends and enemies in its aftermath, when she waged a high-profile battle to oust controversial Police Chief Daryl F. Gates in an effort to transform the department's culture.

The original Bedford Cinema was destroyed by a fire in March 1932. The cinema's owner, Bernard Frutin, immediately commissioned a replacement. The New Bedford was designed by Lennox and McMath and was built by Mr A.B. King. The newly built cinema was opened on 26 December (Boxing Day) 1932. Bernard Frutin sold the cinema to George Green in 1936. The New Bedford Cinema screened its final film, a double bill of Dirty Harry and Klute, on 8 July 1973 and reopened on 12 October 1973 as a Mecca bingo hall. It was designated as a category B listed building on 17 June 1986 by Historic Scotland.

Meadowood Mall contains 125 retailers and restaurants and it is anchored by Macy's Women, Macy's Men/Home, JCPenney, and Dick's Sporting Goods. History Meadowood Mall opened in 1978 anchored by JCPenney, Liberty House, and Macy's. Liberty House closed in 1983 and Macy's South moved in the following year. The mall added a Copeland's Sporting Goods Superstore in 1989 as a fourth anchor. An expansion in 1995 added Sears as a fifth anchor, with additional in-line shops, and the Palms Food Court. Following Copeland's bankruptcy filing in 1996, the company was acquired by Sports Authority. Meadowood Mall's superstore was subsequently re- branded, despite Sports Authority having a stand-alone location less than a mile away. Due to operating costs of having two stores in such a close proximity, the Meadowood location was closed in 2011. The mall underwent cosmetic renovations and inline expansions in 2013 and added Dick's Sporting Goods in a newly constructed anchor location in 2016. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Meadowood Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties. Meadowood Mall currently features 125 shops, a food court and one full-service restaurant. On April 20, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in July 2018. Seritage plans to lease half of the first level of the former Sears into Round One Entertainment. 1995 Expansion Despite renovations, nearby Park Lane Mall struggled to compete with Meadowood Mall and had been failing to retain tenants for several years. The Taubman Company, which owned Meadowood Mall at the time, took advantage and was able to woo several tenants from Park Lane as part of an expansion project. The most notable addition was Sears, which built a two-story anchor location on the north end of the mall, with a new hallway and several new inline store locations leading to the new anchor. The addition also created space for a food court, named the Palms Food Court, to house 12 eateries. Ownership Changes The mall was built and operated by Taubman Company for its first two decades. General Motors Pension Trusts acquired the mall from Taubman in 1998 in exchange for equity it had in the mall company.ICSC Article on first sale Accessed June 2, 2007 In April 2004, General Motors Pension Trusts sold the mall to Mills Corporation,ICSC Article on second Sale Accessed June 2, 2007 which, in turn, was bought by Simon Property Group in 2007.Simon Article on acquisition Accessed June 2, 2007 2013 Modernization The 2006 opening of the upscale Summit Sierra Marketplace in south Reno coupled with the 2008 opening of Legends at Sparks Marina in Sparks, NV left Meadowood Mall trailing in shopping destinations for the region despite it being the lone enclosed mall in the region. As a result, Simon Properties and the mall announced plans for a $3.5 million renovation to bring new stores, restaurants, and a much needed facelift updating the 1970s decor as well as adding more seating areas and device charging stations for mall patrons. The announcement made on 22 January 2013 included the following new stores: Vans scheduled to open in August in a location vacated by The Disney Store, Pink by Victoria's Secret, scheduled to open in May, and Forever 21, scheduled to open in July. Center Court at the mall during construction, 2013 As part of the renovation, many existing tenants relocated to larger, renovated locations closer to the center of the mall and the food court. These moves gave new tenants opportunities to expand into large format stores built from two or three previous tenants. The new Forever 21 store occupied a space from three previous tenants: Borders Express (seasonally occupied by Go Games and Calendars in 2012), Buckle (seasonally occupied by Toys\\"R\\"Us Express in 2012) and Claire's. Buckle relocated within the mall in 2012; Claire's relocated into their Icing brand store which was closed. Additionally, Champs Sports moved to a renovated location vacated by Pac Sun and Kiddie Kandids and Spencer's relocated to the former No Fear location to create space for a new H&M; location. Victoria's Secret temporarily moved, as Pink took their current location near center court. The new Victoria's Secret store was built adjacent to the new Pink store. The renovation also includes updated restrooms and a new private nursing area for mothers. Layout Meadowood Mall has a unique semicircular design, with a straight corridor leading to Sears. A large food court, called the Palms can be found near Sears. Many of the stores in between the anchors are upscale, with many health and beauty and high-end clothing shoppes. A restaurant and small casino can be found near several entrances.

Retrieved 19 November 2011 Parts of the old hospital can still be seen in the modern building, including archways and walls. Under the stage lies a well, which is believed to be dated from the Roman era of York's history. The 1744 theatre replaced a theatre in Minster Yard, built by Thomas Keregan, with the encouragement of the City Corporation, in 1734. Twenty five years after its construction, in 1769, Tate Wilkinson paid ¬£500 for a Royal Patent, and, accordingly, it was renamed the Theatre Royal. Wilkinson ran a company that included theatres in Hull, Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield and other Yorkshire towns. His company was reckoned to be the leading provincial company, and he attracted many of the finest actors of the period, including John Philip Kemble and his sister Sarah Siddons, Dorothea Jordan and Elizabeth Farren, to act in York. Since Wilkinson's time the theatre has undergone several renovations and upgrades. In the late 1800s the theatre was refurbished into the Victorian style, including, in 1880, a new Victorian Gothic frontage, which is decorated with carved heads representing Elizabeth I and characters from Shakespeare's plays. The latest major redevelopment was an extensive renovation of the theatre, with a new modernist foyer (architect: Patrick Gwynne), in 1967. The theatre has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. Pantomime The theatre produced its first pantomime in 1862 with a production of The Sleeping Beauty.

It was directed by Vincent Sherman and produced by Henry Blanke with Jack L. Warner as executive producer from a screenplay by John Van Druten, Lenore Coffee and Edmund Goulding based on Van Druten's 1940 play of the same title. The film starred Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins with Gig Young, John Loder, Dolores Moran, Roscoe Karns and Anne Revere. Background The John Van Druten play on which the film is based had its premiere at the Morosco Theatre, New York City on 23 December 1940 in a production staged by Auriol Lee and designed by Richard Whorf. The play starred Jane Cowl, Peggy Wood and Kent Smith. It ran for 170 performances. Bette Davis initially wanted Norma Shearer to take the role of Millie. But Shearer, who was semi-retired, declined to take the secondary role and second billing. Miriam Hopkins who had filmed The Old Maid with Davis and had endured a difficult working relationship with Davis (owing to the resentment created when Davis allegedly had an affair with Hopkins' husband Anatole Litvak) accepted the role. Plot In 1924, newly successful author Kit Marlowe (Bette Davis) returns to her hometown to speak, as part of a lecture tour, and to visit her dear childhood friend Millie (Miriam Hopkins). The friends have formed distinctly opposite personalities: Kit is witty, perceptive, wry and calmer, while Millie is intense, self-involved and histrionic. Millie has married Preston Drake (John Loder) and is pregnant, and she surprises Kit when she discloses she has also written a book, a romance novel. Millie asks Kit to present her book to her publisher. Upon their meeting, Preston appears to be impressed by Kit Marlowe. Eight years pass, and Millie has become increasingly difficult and resentful of any diversion from full attention being focused upon herself. When Kit jokes and glowingly reports about her shopping trip with Preston and Millie's only child, Deirdre (Dolores Moran), Millie impudently retorts \\"Time you had one of your own!\\" as she swans out. Preston immediately asks Kit why she has remained so loyal to Millie over the years. Kit confides in Preston despite Millie's often emotionally unstable and dysfunctional behaviour, she feels indebted as Millie was her first real friend. Kit feels a particular loyalty to Millie as orphaned Kit grew up with an aunt who died and found a sense of home and family through Millie's parents' kindness and generosity towards Kit. Millie has become a very successful writer, with a string of romance novels. This has made her very arrogant and condescending to those around her. Visiting New York, on the eve of the opening of a play written by Kit, the Drakes' marriage is slowly disintegrating. In an interview with a reporter, Preston, an architect and engineer, is shown to feel secondary to his wife‚Äôs success. In a private moment with Kit, when Millie mentions Preston‚Äôs drinking habit, Kit replies ‚Äúpeople drink for escape,‚Äù but Millie does not seem to appreciate Kit‚Äôs point. In a private moment between Preston and Kit, he professes his love for her. Millie and Preston clash with Kit playing referee. The response is complete ingratitude from self-absorbed Millie and growing romantic feelings from an increasingly frustrated Preston. Moments later, as the three converse, Preston and Millie's argument escalates (with Millie displaying what some might interpret as ‚Äòmanic‚Äô behavior) and Preston leaves Millie ‚Äòfor good‚Äô. Kit tracks down Preston and tries to convince him to return to Millie, but he tries to convince Kit that he is in love with her. Selflessly, Kit tells him she can not reciprocate, as she could not do that to Millie. They kiss goodbye and part. Ten years pass, and World War Two is underway. Kit is on a radio show espousing the good of the American Red Cross, and Preston, now a major in the Army, hears her. He calls the radio station to suggest they meet for a drink. They do, but Kit also has her much-younger beau, Rudd Kendall (Gig Young), and Preston‚Äôs almost 18-year-old daughter, Deirdre, whom Preston has not seen in those ten years, join them. Preston tells Kit he is engaged, and Kit is happy for him. Preston and his daughter become reacquainted. The next morning Rudd (again) presses Kit to marry him, but she puts him off, promising an answer in a few days, and he leaves. Rudd, feeling reproached and rejected, then meets with Deirdre. Millie treats Preston's return as a victory and sets the scene for a desperate reconciliation. Preston however dashes her hopes by revealing his engagement and asks for ‚Äòjoint custody‚Äô of Deirdre. Preston incidentally discloses to Millie that he was once in love with Kit. An outraged Millie throws him out. Millie then rants and raves to Deirdre about how Kit is a Jezebel (the writer's tongue-in-cheek reference to Davis‚Äôs 1938 film Jezebel). Millie spitefully does her best to poison Deirdre against Kit and relishes in excessively establishing herself as the center of attention and reveling in her self-indulgence, oblivious to Deirdre's clear distress. Millie also discloses that Kit is to marry Rudd, causing Deirdre further distress, and Deirdre leaves. Kit and Millie have an all-out argument about all that hasn‚Äôt been said until now, where Millie acts victimized and Kit reveals a few brutal home truths to an in denial and melodramatic Millie. Millie even goes as far to discard to her own daughter to her love rival. Realizing her words are falling on deafened ears, frustrated Kit physically shakes Millie to \\"knock some sense\\" into her self-obsessed friend in arguably the film's most remembered scene. That night, Kit, having decided to marry Rudd, finds out from him that he is now in love with Deirdre. Kit tracks down Deirdre at a handsome but incompatible beau's bachelor pad, calms her, and returns her to Rudd. Kit then returns home to find Millie, and they reconcile. Millie tells Kit about her new book, about the trials of two women friends, and Kit suggests that Millie title the book ‚ÄúOld Acquaintance‚Äù. Millie agrees.

The PIRA claimed the men were members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), but that was denied by their families, by security sources and by the UDA. RUC sources indicated the shootings may have been a case of mistaken identity. In May 1994, at a special court in Coleraine, Patrick Kelly (29) and Liam Averill (29), both of Maghera, County Londonderry, were accused of murdering Smyth and McCloy, and of the attempted murder of the third occupant of the vehicle.

West Germany is shown in blue, East Germany is shown in red, The Saar protectorate under French economic control is shown in green. The Ruhr Area, the industrial engine of West Germany, is shown in brown as it was to some extent under the control of the International Authority for the Ruhr. Pre-war German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line is shown in gray, because it was assigned to Poland or annexed by the Soviet Union. This included Silesia, Germany's second-largest industrial center after the Ruhr. West Berlin is shown in yellow. The industrial plans for Germany were designs the Allies considered imposing on Germany in the Aftermath of World War II to reduce and manage Germany's industrial capacity. Background At the Potsdam conference (July‚ÄìAugust 1945), with the US seeking to implement the Morgenthau plan, drawn up by Henry Morgenthau Jr, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, the victorious Allies decided to abolish the German armed forces as well as all munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them. This included the destruction of all ship- and aircraft-manufacturing capability. Further, the victors decided that civilian industries that might have military potential were to be restricted. The restriction of the latter was calibrated with Germany's \\"approved peacetime needs\\", which were defined based on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level-of-industry requirements. Level of industry plans Allocation policy for \\"surplus\\" German heavy industry. The first \\"level of industry\\" plan, signed by the Allies on March 29, 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants.Henry C. Wallich. Mainsprings of the German Revival (1955) pg. 348. In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production capacity: the maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the prewar production level.\\"Cornerstone of Steel\\", Time Magazine, January 21, 1946 The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a less-limited reduction of 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the US, France, and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the Great Depression (1932).Cost of Defeat, Time Magazine, April 8, 1946 Car production was set to 10% of prewar levels, etc.The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3 Herbert Hoover, March, 1947 pg. 8 On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported: Timber exports from the US occupation zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the US government admitted that the purpose of this was the \\"ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests.\\" Extensive deforestation due to clear-felling resulted in a situation which could \\"be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century.\\".Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 119.

Bryce, from 12 March 1948, page 16 of The Spectator The first plan was subsequently followed by a number of new ones, the last signed in 1949. By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by-then much watered-down \\"level of industry\\" plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.Frederick H. Gareau \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 517-534 Moderation of policy Beginning in mid-1946 American and British policy towards the German economy began to change, illustrated by Byrnes's September speech restatement of policy on GermanyDennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p178 (also known as the \\"Stuttgart speech\\" or \\"Speech of hope\\"). According to Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress in A History of West Germany the Morgenthau Plan came to be seen as inflicting undue hardship, and so the approach was shifted, over time, to one encouraging German economic expansion. As part of this, the allowed levels of industrial capacity were raised.Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A History of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p179 According to Vladimir Petrov in Money and conquest: allied occupation currencies in World War II the reason for the change in US occupation policy was almost exclusively based on economic considerations. Although a large part of the occupation costs were placed on the German economy, the US and the UK were increasingly forced to supply food imports to prevent mass starvation.Vladimir Petrov, Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 261 According to some historians the US government abandoned the Morgenthau Plan as policy in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes' speech Restatement of Policy on Germany. Others have argued that credit should be given to former US President Herbert Hoover who in one of his reports from Germany in 1947 argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating: > There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be > reduced to a \\"pastoral state\\". It cannot be done unless we exterminate or > move 25,000,000 people out of it.Erik Reinert, Jomo K.S.

Time Magazine July 28, 1947. Nevertheless, General Clay needed over two months to overcome continued resistance among his staff to the new directive, but on July 10, 1947, it was finally approved at a meeting of the SWNCC. The final version of the document \\"was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau Plan.\\"Vladimir Petrov, Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 236 (Petrov footnotes Hammond, American Civil-Military Decisions, p. 443) The restrictions placed on German heavy industry production were thus partly ameliorated, as permitted steel production levels were raised from 25% of pre-war capacity to a new limit placed at 50% of pre-war capacity.Pas de Pagaille! Time Magazine, Jul. 28, 1947. Economic consequences The hunger-winter of 1947, thousands protest against the disastrous food situation (March 31, 1947). The reduction in steel production that resulted from the first and the second level of industry plans meant that a steel production bottleneck ensued which forced other parts of German industry to fall below their own permitted production levels. The economy of the Bizone finally hit rock bottom early in 1948 as a consequence of this.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 128-128. Compounding the problems in the steel industry and their effects on the German economy as a whole was the prohibition against importing high-grade Swedish iron ore. Until that was lifted in 1948, German steel plants had to rely on low quality local ore which required almost twice the amount of coal to process. Moreover, the Germans were also forced to sell their steel at wartime prices until April 1, 1948, which meant large losses for the industry.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 130. Additionally, attempts to \\"decartelize\\" the German steel industry also contributed to the low output. The Allied Control Council set the price for German coal at half what it cost to produce it.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 124 From May 1945 until September 1947 the US, UK, and France exported German coal for $10.50/tonne, while the world price hovered closer to $25‚Äì$30 per tonne. During this period the Allies thus took roughly $200,000,000 out of the German economy from this source alone. In September 1947 the export price was raised but remained set at $5‚Äì$7 below world-market prices. In Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem. According to the UNRRA in 1946‚Äì47 the average kilocalorie intake per day was estimated to be 1,080,Alan S. Milward, The Reconstruction of Western Europe. Table p.14 which according to Alan S. Milward was an amount insufficient for long-term health.Alan S. Milward, The Reconstruction of Western Europe. p.18 Other sources state that the kilocalorie intake in those years varied between as low as 1,000 and 1,500. William L. Clayton reported to Washington that \\"millions of people are slowly starving.\\"Gregory A. Fossedal, Our Finest Hour. Germany received many offers from Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed coal and steel. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of lard a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. However, the Allies disallowed the Germans to trade.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948\\", Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 125 The UNRRA charter allowed it to operate in Germany to assist non-ethnic German displaced persons, but did not permit it to assist ethnic Germans. In 1948, after three years of occupation, the combined US and UK expenditure on relief food in Germany through GARIOA and other means stood at a total of close to $1.5 billion (that were charged to the Germans). Still, according to Nicholas Balabkins, German food rations were deficient in composition and remained far below recommended minimum nutrition levels.Nicholas Balabkins, \\"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945‚Äì1948\\", Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 107 Officials in authority admitted that the distributed rations \\"represented a fairly rapid starvation level\\". (see also American food policy in occupied Germany). Reparations and exploitation The Allies confiscated large amounts of German intellectual property (patents and copyrights, but also trademarks).C. Lester Walker \\"Secrets By The Thousands\\", Harper's Magazine. October 1946 Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years the US pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book \\"Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany\\", that the \\"intellectual reparations\\" taken by the US (and the UK) amounted to close to $10 billion.Norman M. Naimark The Russians in Germany pg. 206. (Naimark refers to Gimbels book) (Compared to America's 1948 GDP of $258 billion and total Marshall plan expenditure (1948-1952) of $13 billion, of which Germany received $1 billion in loans and $400 million as a grant). The US competitors of German firms were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities.John Gimbel \\"Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany\\" In 1947 the director of the US Commerce Department's Office of Technical Services stated before congress: \\"The fundamental justification of this activity is that we won the war and the Germans did not. If the Germans had won the war, they would be over here in Schenectady and Chicago and Detroit and Pittsburgh, doing the same things.\\" A German report from May 1, 1949, stated that many entrepreneurs preferred not to do research under the current regulations (Allied Control Council Law No. 25) for fear of the research directly profiting their competitors. The law required detailed reporting to the Allies of all research results. The patents, drawings and physical equipment taken in Germany included such items (or drawings for) as electron microscopes, cosmetics, textile machinery, tape recorders, insecticides, a unique chocolate-wrapping machine, a continuous butter-making machine, a manure spreader, ice skate grinders, paper napkin machines, \\"and other technologies ‚Äî almost all of which were either new to American industry or 'far superior' to anything in use in the United States.\\"JEAN EDWARD SMITH, \\"FEATURE REVIEW American Exploitation of Postwar Germany\\", Diplomatic History, Volume 17 Issue 1, Pages 135‚Äì142 The British took commercial secrets too, by abducting German scientists and technicians, or simply by interning German businessmen if they refused to reveal trade secrets.How T-Force abducted Germany's best brains for Britain Secret papers reveal post-war campaign to loot military and commercial assets, Ian Cobain, The Guardian, August 29, 2007 (accessed 2008-05-20) Konrad Adenauer stated: > According to a statement made by an American expert, the patents formerly > belonging to IG Farben have given the American chemical industry a lead of > at least 10 years. The damage thus caused to the German economy is huge and > cannot be assessed in figures. It is extraordinarily regrettable that the > new German inventions cannot be protected either, because Germany is not a > member of the Patent Union. Britain has declared that it will respect German > inventions regardless of what the peace treaty may say. But America has > refused to issue such a declaration. German inventors are therefore not in a > position to exploit their own inventions. This puts a considerable brake on > German economic development.Konrad Adenauer, \\"Memoirs\\", Volume 1, p.148 > (1966) In JCS 1067 there were provisions allowing German scientists be detained for intelligence purposes as required. Although the original focus on the exploitation was towards military means, much of the information collected by FIAT was quickly adapted commercially to the degree that the office of the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas requested that the peace treaty with Germany be redacted to protect US industry from lawsuits. The US made no attempt to evaluate the value of what was taken from Germany, and in the contracts that led to sovereignty for West Germany in 1955 the West Germans had to formally renounce all claims to possible compensation for all types of assets taken, including scientific and technical know-how. Gimbel notes that this made a later accounting practically impossible. The property taken in Germany was without regard to the rules of the Hague Convention, which prohibits the seizure of enemy private property \\"unless it is susceptible of direct military use\\", but there are legal arguments that the Allied occupation of Germany was not bound by Hague Conventions, because if the German state no longer existed (see debellatio), and the convention only applied to the occupation of territory belonging to one of the Contracting Powers then it did not cover the territories of Germany post war.Eyal Benvenisti, The international law of occupation, Princeton University Press, 2004, , p. 93Melissa Patterson (2006), Who‚Äôs Got the Title? or, The Remnants of Debellatio in Post-Invasion Iraq , Harvard International Law Journal, Vol. 47, No. 2, p. 457 The legal status of Germany under occupation is however unclear, particularly as debellatio in general involves the complete dissolution and annexation of the defeated state, which did not take place and indeed in the Berlin Declaration (1945) it was categorically denied that Germany was annexed. However, the eastern quarter of Germany was later annexed and its German inhabitants expelled). Marshall plan With the Western Allies eventually becoming concerned about the deteriorating economic situation in their \\"Trizone\\"; the US Marshall Plan of economic aid to Europe was extended also to Western Germany in 1948 and a currency reform, which had been prohibited under the occupation directive JCS 1067, introduced the Deutsche Mark and halted rampant inflation. The Ruhr The Ruhr Agreement was imposed on the Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the Federal Republic of Germany. By controlling the production and distribution of coal and steel (i.e. how much coal and steel the Germans themselves would get), the International Authority for the Ruhr in effect controlled the entire West German economy, much to the dismay of the Germans. They were however permitted to send their delegations to the authority after the Petersberg agreement. With the West German agreement to join the European Coal and Steel Community in order to lift the restrictions imposed by the IAR, thus also ensuring French security by perpetuating French access to Ruhr coal,France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944-1954 H-Net Reviews June 2001 the role of the IAR was taken over by the ECSC. The Saar With US permission, as for example given in the Stuttgart speech, France expanded the borders of the Saarland, after the Ruhr Germany's largest remaining source of coal, by adding parts of the Rhineland and thereafter detached it as a protectorate in 1947. The area was integrated into the French economy, and although nominally politically independent its security and foreign policies were decided in Paris, which also maintained a High Commissioner with wide-ranging powers in the protectorate. The Soviet Union In accordance with the agreements with the USSR shipment of dismantled German industrial installations from the west began on March 31, 1946. By August 1947 11,100 tons of equipment had been shipped east as reparations to the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the agreement the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so the US temporarily halted shipments east (although they were never resumed). However, it was later shown that although the shipments stop was utilized for cold war propaganda reasons, the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recusant behavior of France.John Gimbel, \\"The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History\\" Material sent to the U.S.S.R. included equipment from the Kugelfischer ball-bearing plant at Schweinfurt, the Daimler-Benz underground aircraft-engine plant at Obrigheim, the Deschimag shipyards at Bremen, and the Gendorf powerplant. End of dismantling The dismantling of German industry continued, and in 1949 Konrad Adenauer wrote to the Allies requesting that it end, citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories, and also the unpopularity of the policy.Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p259 (See also Adenauers original letter to Schuman, Ernest Bevins letter to Robert Schuman urging a reconsideration of the dismantling policy.) Support for dismantling was by this time coming predominantly from the French, and the Petersberg Agreement of November 1949 reduced the levels vastly, though dismantling of minor factories continued until 1951.Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance (Oxford 1989) p260 In 1951 West Germany agreed to join the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) the following year.

SANFL career A goalkicking rover, Hodgeman established a reputation as a skillful and courageous player. He won the Reserves grade Magarey Medal in 1974 despite spending almost half the season playing in Glenelg's league team. Hodgeman won Glenelg's best and fairest award in 1977 and 1978 and also topped the club's goal kicking for seasons in 1978 (51 goals) and 1979 (32 goals). In 1978, Hodgeman won the League's highest individual award, the Magarey Medal for \\"fairest and most brilliant\\" player, polling one vote more than three-time winner of the award, Russell Ebert.http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/hi- hz.htm#Kym%20Hodgeman%20(Glenelg%20&%20North%20Melbourne ) By winning the medal Hodgeman became one of just a handful of players who would win the award in both the SANFL League and Reserves competitions. In 1979 Hodgeman was selected as an All-Australian following that year's State of Origin Carnival in Perth. VFL career Like many South Australian players of the time, Hodgeman was lured to the more lucrative VFL at the peak of his career. In late 1977, he signed a Form Four which tied him to the Carlton Football Club when he chose to move to Victoria; but, in 1980, while Hodgeman was still at Glenelg, Carlton traded his Form Four to as part of a deal to secure Greg Wells. Hodgeman had no desire to play for Melbourne, and objected to Carlton's treatment of his contract, likening it to horse trading, so he turned his back on both clubs and signed with in 1981.

Over his five seasons in the VFL Hodgeman played in 91 games, kicking 133 goals.

The film was concluded by a sequel, Tragic Hero which was also released in 1987. Plot Rich & Famous tells the story of two boys who are not related but grew up as brothers, Kwok (Andy Lau) and Yung (Alex Man). While Yung is the elder, he is always getting into trouble which Kwok has to help bail him out of. One day, in 1967, Yung's gambling goes too far and he loses a bet he cannot afford to lose. Kwok and Yung get into a massive fight with the local gang running the gambling hall. The boss threatens to cut Yung's pinky off. Fortunately Kwok tells a touching tale about how their father is ill and that is why they are gambling to support him. The pair hatch a plan with their nervous cousin Mak Ying Hung (Alan Tam), who has gang connections, to rob some goods from a gang boss, Chu Lo-Tai (Chun Hsiung Ko). They succeed at stealing the suitcase and attempt to buy plane tickets to America to avoid paying off the debts. They are interrupted at the travel office and Kwok is taken away to be tortured. The sister of Yung, Wai Chui (Pauline Chan) works at a tea house that a powerful gangster named Li Ah Chai (Chow Yun Fat) frequents. She comes in to serve him and is rudely bitten by Li Ah Chai's friend Fan. It reveals a wound that was sustained when Kwok was captured. She and Yung explain their situation and despite advice against helping them, Li Ah Chai decides to bail them out by threatening the gangsters with force. Chu Lo-Tai releases Kwok but not before burning his tongue with his cigar and pouring hot coffee down his throat. Kwok thanks Li Ah Chai and then passes out from happiness when Ah Chai offers him and Yung a job as gangsters. Mak Ying Hung asks Kwok and Yung to introduce him to Li Ah Chai so that he may become a gangster as well. Mak stutters uncontrollably and sneezes in Ah Chai's face. He makes a poor impression and Ah Chai ignores him. Kwok gives Mak a chance so he and Mak go to collect money where Mak is unable to extract the money from the local business. He is thoroughly embarrassed and Ah Chai tells Mak that he is not cut out to be a gangster. Mak walks up the street, which brings a close to act 1. Fast forward to 1971, Kwok and Yung have advanced in Ah Chai's gang and their sister Wai Chui is now Li Ah Chai's housekeeper. They arrange to do a business deal with a gangster. The gangster double crosses them, leading to Kwok being seriously injured. Yung is reprimanded for being selfish and attention seeking for not staying in the van to keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior. This clearly shows the tension starting to rise between Yung and Ah Chai. In attempt to gain favor, Yung introduces Ah Chai to his love interest, Mak's cousin, Lau Po-Yee (Carina Lau). Ah Chai is distracted and is contacted in regards to an interruption in the drug trade. Ah Chai has been hiding his friend Fan, who has become gravely ill. Fan apparently has crossed the Thailand drug lords and has now stopped any drug shipments to Hong Kong. This draws the ire of the other gangs who demand that Ah Chai kill or turn in Fan. They tell him that the drug trade means a lot to them but maybe not so much to Ah Chai since he is not involved in the drug trade for profit. It is at this point that Yung suddenly speaks up and acknowledges that the drug trade is important, contrary to Ah Chai's response. Ah Chai's rival, Chu Lo-Tai notices Yung's impulsiveness. Ah Chai explains that he owes Fan a personal debt because Fan had saved his father. To turn him in would mean dishonor. Ah Chai declines. In the car, on the way back, Ah Chai chastises Yung for speaking up, claiming that it showed the lack of cohesiveness within their gang. He banishes Yung to a local bar. Meanwhile, Kwok visits Mak to see how he is doing. Mak has lost his stutter, has a nice place and now looks handsome. Mak again asks for Kwok to get him into the gang. Kwok hesitates and then they are rudely interrupted by Yung. Yung talks to Kwok in private and asks where he would stand in the event that there is a split between him and Ah Chai. Kwok doesn't openly choose sides and Yung gives him a hug. Inspector Cheung (Danny Lee) visits Ah Chai at a restaurant and tells Ah Chai that he is going to put him in jail. Ah Chai is not fazed by the inspector's threat. Ah Chai attempts to buy off Inspector Cheung but he won't take it. Ah Chai realizes he must be dealt with before he causes him trouble in the future. Yung then meets secretly with Chu Lo-Tai and is paid to kill Fan. Yung shows up at Fan's location and kills him and the guard. Yung then is called to Ah Chai's office. Ah Chai says that he knows that Yung killed Fan and asks his henchman, Number 6 (Shing Fu-On) to kill Yung. Kwok barges into the room and begs for Yung's life. Ah Chai takes the gun and shoots Yung in the hand. He tells them both to get lost. Li Ah Chai converses with Wai Chui and asks her if she wants to leave now that he's had a falling out with her brothers. She wants to stay and tells Ah Chai that she will do anything for him and is about to admit her crush on Ah Chai when Po Yee suddenly appears, offering cake. Ah Chai warms to her and ignores Wai Chui. Wai Chui tries to walk with tears in her eyes. Li Ah Chai spends more time with Po Yee and they become engaged. The scene then switches back to Yung and Kwok. They both go to Chu Lo-Tai to talk to him. Kwok and Yung have a falling out over Yung's behavior and he leaves him, saying that they are no longer brothers. As Kwok tries to leave, Chu Lo-Tai attempts to kill him using gasoline and guns. Kwok gets away to Mak's apartment and hides out there briefly. Yung arrives and questions Mak as to where Kwok is. Mak refuses to tell him and Yung chops off Mak's pinky. Mak stares defiantly back at Yung. Li Ah Chai meets with Kwok and Mak after Yung's attack and they become friends again. Ah Chai invites them to the wedding. Meanwhile, Yung plots to kill Ah Chai at the wedding. The wedding occurs and Yung's men ambushes Ah Chai on the steps. They manage to shoot Po Yee. Ah Chai and Po Yee attempt to escape while being chased by Yung. Mak runs Yung down and beats him with a fender. He is shot in the chest by Yung. The last assassin has Po Yee hostage and stabs her in the side. Mak distracts the assassin long enough for Ah Chai to kill him. Ah Chai has Yung at gunpoint until suddenly his father and Wai Chui appear, begging for his life. Yung runs and is caught by police. Ah Chai thanks Mak for all he has done as he passes away. In the epilogue, it indicates that Kwok quits the underworld and leaves for Malacca. Yung is sentenced to 6 years of jail. Ah Chai attempts to shift away from the world of violence to appease his new wife. Chu Lo-Tai leaves the country to avoid revenge from Ah Chai. Inspector Cheung is banished to border patrol for 3 years.

Before being appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on March 18, 2016, Pratte was a journalist for over 35 years and was editor- in-chief of the Montreal newspaper La Presse. He was a member of the Independent Senators Group.  Biography  Pratte studied political science at the University of Montreal and graduated in 1980. Before even finishing his degree, he was offered a position at CKAC, a francophone radio station in Montreal. Between 1979 and 1986, he worked there as a writer, reporter, parliamentary correspondent in Ottawa and deputy news editor. In 1986, Pratte started his career in print journalism at La Presse and was employed by the paper until 2015. He worked as a columnist and political editor. Succeeding Alain Dubuc, he became editor-in-chief in 2001, defending the federalist and fiscally centre-right political stance of the paper. In 1994, Pratte was suspended from La Presse after publishing a column entitled ‚ÄúTout est pourri‚Äù [It's all rotten], in which he criticized Power Corporation, the newspaper's owner at the time. After pressure from the newspaper's union of journalists, he was reinstated in his role at La Presse. In 2009, Pratte co-founded The Federal Idea, a Quebec-based, non-partisan think tank focused on federalism, and served as chair of its board of directors until 2014. Pratte's father, Yves Pratte (1925‚Äì1988), was a lawyer, chairperson of Air Canada (1968‚Äì1975), justice on the Supreme Court of Canada (1977‚Äì1979) and director of Power Corporation and Power Financial. His brother, Guy Pratte, is a partner at Borden Ladner Gervais. Guy Pratte, called to both the Ontario and Quebec Bar, received the Law Society of Ontario Medal in 2019 for exceptional career achievement and contribution to his community. He received the OBA Award of Excellence in Civil Litigation in 2019 from the Ontario Bar Association and was also named Advocatus Emeritus by the Qu√©bec Bar for \\"outstanding contributions to the legal profession.\\"  Senate of Canada  Following a reform of the Senate appointment process, the goal of which was to make the Senate less partisan, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Andr√© Pratte on March 18, 2016, as part of the first wave of independent nominations. Senator Pratte has sponsored four bills in the Upper House: * 2016: Bill C-10, An Act to amend the Air Canada Public Participation Act and to provide for certain other measures *2017: Bill C-30, Canada‚ÄìEuropean Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement Implementation Act * 2018: Bill C-86, Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2 * 2019: Bill C-71, An Act to amend certain Acts and Regulations in relation to firearms Pratte was Deputy Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, a member of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and a member of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence. He resigned his position on October 21, 2019, the date of the 2019 Canadian federal election.  Publications  In 2005, Pratte was among the group who signed the manifesto \\"For a clear-eyed vision of Quebec\\", better known by the French title \\"Pour un Qu√©bec lucide\\" and critical of the social democratic 'Quebec Model'. Criticized by some sovereigntists, he has defended his neutrality and has claimed in the book Aux pays des merveilles to be a soft-nationalist and to have a soft-sovereigntist past (with claims of 'Yes' votes in both the 1980 and the 1995 Quebec referendums). He published a number of books at VLB √©diteur. The first, Le Syndrome de Pinocchio, discussed dishonesty in politics and earned him a motion of censure from the National Assembly of Quebec in 1997. He also published a biography of the future Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, under the title L'√ânigme Charest in 1997, drawing a paradoxical portrait of the man. He redirected his criticism upon his own journalistic profession in Les Oiseaux de malheur in 2000. Pratte edited Reconquerir le Canada ‚Äî un nouveau projet pour la nation qu√©b√©coise (published in English as Reconquering Canada: Quebec Federalists Speak Up for Change), a book of essays by several prominent francophone Quebecers to better promote federalism in the province. The authors stated they want Quebec to have a greater role within the federation. Pratte said the province must be better linked with other provinces and that Quebecers must serve on bodies of the federal government. To make progress, Quebecers must change their view of federalism and Canada, and their perception of being a victim, which does not correspond with experience. The book counts 14 authors from various political affiliations: Andr√© Pratte, Daniel Fournier, Jean Leclair, Beno√Æt Pelletier, Marie Bernard- Meunier, Patrice Ryan et Fr√©d√©ric B√©rard, Fran√ßois Pratte, Martin Cauchon, Pierre Gerlier-Forest, Herv√© Rivet and Fabrice Rivault, Marc Garneau, Mathieu Laberge.

Prior to this, between 2006 and 2012 K√∂vesi was the Prosecutor General of Romania (Procuror General), attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice. Upon appointment in 2006, K√∂vesi was the first woman and the youngest Prosecutor General in Romania's history. She is also the only public servant to have held the office of Prosecutor General for the entire duration of its term. K√∂vesi was described by The Guardian in 2015 as a \\"quiet, unassuming chief prosecutor who is bringing in the scalps\\", leading \\"an anti-corruption drive quite unlike any other in eastern Europe ‚Äì or the world for that matter\\". Her tenure as head of the DNA has substantially increased public confidence in the institution, both within Romania and across the EU, with a 2015 poll reporting that a high 60% of Romanians trust the DNA (compared to 61% for the Romanian Orthodox Church and only 11% for the parliament). In February 2016, K√∂vesi was renominated for chief prosecutor by the Ministry of Justice, based on the positive results achieved under her leadership. In early 2018 Justice Minister Tudorel Toader proposed her dismissal as DNA chief prosecutor after presenting a report on her managerial activity at DNA based on 20 categories and allegations. Among the accusations were: excessive authoritarian behavior, discretion of the Chief Prosecutor of the DNA, involvement in other prosecutors' inquiries, prioritization of the files according to the media impact, violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Romania and signing illegal agreements with the Secret Services. President Iohannis initially refused to revoke her, but a Constitutional Court decision forced him to do so, stating that he can only verify its legality, not the arguments that lead to the proposal. On 5 May 2020, the European Court of Human Rights held that the aforementioned revocation of Kovesi violated her right to a fair trial as well as her right to free speech. In October 2019, after beating out competition from French magistrate , K√∂vesi was confirmed as the first EU Public Prosecutor.  Life and studies  Born in Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe as Laura Codru»õa Lascu, K√∂vesi played professional basketball in her youth, at the club in Media»ô and in Sibiu, and was selected for the junior players national team which finished second in the 1989 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship for Women. Between 1991 and 1995, she studied Law at the Babes- Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca. In 2012, Kovesi graduated with a Ph.D. in Law (for which she studied at the West University of Timi»ôoara) with a thesis on combating organized crime. Codru»õa Lascu married Edu√°rd K√∂vesi, an ethnic Hungarian, and kept his surname after their divorce in 2007. She can speak Romanian and English.https://www.juridice.ro/wp- content/uploads/2012/10/8.-Kovesi-Laura-Codruta.pdf  Professional activity  Between 15 September 1995 and 1 May 1999, K√∂vesi was a prosecutor for the Court in Sibiu. Between May 1999 and October 2012, K√∂vesi led the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) branch in Sibiu County. On 2 October 2012, she replaced Ilie Boto»ô as the Prosecutor General of the Prosecutor's Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice.  Direc»õia Na»õionalƒÉ Anticorup»õie (National Antigraft Agency)  Under K√∂vesi's leadership, the DNA made notable progress against high-level corruption in Romania. having prosecuted dozens of mayors (such as Sorin Oprescu), five MPs, two ex-ministers and a former prime minister in 2014 alone. Hundreds of former judges and prosecutors have also been brought to justice, with a conviction rate above 90%. In 2015, 12 members of parliament were investigated, including ministers: \\"we have investigated two sitting ministers, one of whom went from his ministerial chair directly to pre-trial detention\\", K√∂vesi said. As a result of the 2015 DNA yearly retrospective, K√∂vesi declared that 431 million euros in bribes was the amount given in the cases that were presented to the Court. Victor Ponta, former prime minister of Romania and the highest-ranking government official currently under DNA investigation and prosecution, accused K√∂vesi of being \\"a totally unprofessional prosecutor trying to make a name by inventing and imagining facts and untrue situations from 10 years ago\\". These comments were posted on his Facebook page, following his indictment on charges of forgery, money laundering, and tax evasion, brought against him by the DNA.  Controversies  In 2018, the Social Democratic Party-led government established the \\"Department for Investigating Judicial Offences\\" to investigate prosecutors. This was criticized by the Venice Commission, who considered that they would likely undermine the independence of the Romanian prosecutors and judges and public confidence in the judiciary. Nevertheless, the government pushed forward, and, on 13 February 2019, Laura Codru»õa K√∂vesi was summoned by this institution as a suspect in a case in which the allegations are malfeasance in office, bribery and false testimony, following a complaint by , a fugitive politician and businessman prosecuted for corruption. On 7 March 2019, K√∂vesi was summoned and questioned by the prosecutors of the Department for Investigating Judicial Offences; at the end she was notified that she was a suspect in a second, different investigation, where she was accused of coordinating an \\"organized group of prosecutors\\" which prosecuted people illegally. The Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice disciplinary Prosecutor's Section issued a statement on 24 of June 2019, about one of the actions aimed at Laura Codruta K√∂vesi. Prosecutors have dismissed the disciplinary action initiated by the Judicial Inspection over the former DNA Chief. The Romanian High Court of Cassation considered her innocent.

Some of the things that he did were really top drawer.\\" At the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Burgess was named in the England National Game XI squad for the Four Nations Tournament against Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and in May 2007, he scored against Scotland in a 3‚Äì0 victory as England went on to win tournament. In August 2007, Burgess re- joined Rushden & Diamonds on a free transfer with a sell-on clause attached, signing a two-year contract. At the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, he won the Player of the Year award at Rushden and admitted that he had sometimes made the wrong decisions in his career, saying, \\"I don't think there's any points having regrets. I've enjoyed my football this season as much as I have during my whole career working for Garry Hill and I think next season we can go on and achieve good things here.\\" He was again selected for the England C squad in May 2008 and scored in the 3‚Äì0 win over Wales as England retained the Four Nations trophy. After rejecting the offer of a new contract from Rushden at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Burgess signed a two-year contract with Luton Town in May 2009. Burgess, who was born in Bedfordshire and supports Luton Town, called the transfer a \\"dream move\\". However, a hamstring injury sustained in late August kept Burgess out of the team for two months and, upon his return to the team, he played in just three further matches before joining Mansfield Town on a one-month loan on 26 November, with the permanent transfer taking place on 1 January 2010. Burgess left Mansfield at the end of the season by mutual consent. On 21 July 2010, he joined Chester in the Northern Premier League Division One North, dropping four leagues. He went on to sign for Fleetwood Town in October 2010 on an emergency basis. On 20 November 2010, Burgess joined Corby Town in the Conference North, after mutually agreeing the termination of his Chester contract. Burgess went on to sign for Conference South club Woking in March 2011. Burgess left Woking at the end of the 2010/11 season after defeat in the play-off's, and rejoined Corby Town as player/coach for the 2011‚Äì12 season. In July 2013, Burgess signed for Stamford. Managerial career Burgess briefly managed Sheffield Wednesday Women in the Northern Premier Division from October 2009 until February 2010. He was formerly first-team coach at Leeds Carnegie Ladies and, prior to that, assistant manager at National Premier Division side Nottingham Forest Ladies. He was named Preston North End Women manager in June 2010. On 6 July 2012, Burgess was handed the role of First Team Manager at FA National Premier Division club Leeds United Ladies. On 31 May 2014, Burgess took up his first managerial role in men's football when he accepted the position of first team manager of North West Counties Division One club Barnton.

It is on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line, between and stations. Built as part of the stretch that bypasses most of the surface stretch of the Filyovskaya Line, Slavyansky Bulvar serves the residents of the southwestern districts situated between the Fruzensky and Filyovsky radii. The station was opened on 7 September 2008. Description Originally the section between Kuntsevskaya and Park Pobedy was to have two stations instead of one. The first one, Minskaya was to be located on the western side of Moscow's Victory Park near the intersection of Minskaya Street and Kutuzovsky Avenue. Whilst the second station, Slavyansky Bulvar, was to be located on the southern side of the same Kutuzovsky prospect in the Fili- Davydkovo District, next to the Slavyansky Boulevard (hence the name), construction of which began to a point where the future pit was ready for the tunnel boring shield. However the prioritisation of constructing a line to Strogino, and the importance of locking the bypass made the Moscow government change its original plan. The curvature of the bypass was reduced (and thus its length by 0.9 km), as was the amount of stations to save time. Originally the station Minskaya was more favoured, but under pressure of locals, the location of Minskaya would leave a provision for a station to be built in at a later date, and Slavyansky Bulvar was returned, however the change of the track path meant that the station would now be on the northern side of the avenue, on the intersection with the Starorublyovskoye highway. The station, designed by Architect S.Volovich, is a single-vault design of shallow depth. The vault rests on horizontal walls, due to the favourable hydroisolation conditions that are present there. Internally the walls are revetted with green Cuban marble \\"Verde Guatemala\\", topped with aluminium profile onto which lighting elements are fixed. Grey granite \\"Aleksandorovsky\\" covers the floor apart from platform edge, which has a darker \\"Gabbro\\". In addition the platform has three beech benches.

Over the years it has been broadcast on both BBC One Scotland and BBC Two Scotland. History The Beechgrove Garden is a gardening programme, which started on 14 April 1978. It was inspired by the garden behind the home of WGBH in Boston, Massachusetts, named the Victory Garden.\\"Garden parties as Beechgrove hits 40: Birthday bash for a show that‚Äôs still bursting with life\\" - The Sunday Post, 12 August 2018 The original plot of land used was the small area of garden attached to the BBC studios in Beechgrove Terrace, Aberdeen. Due to its small size, the programme's popularity and the fact the garden had been transformed several times over, a new area of ground to the west of Aberdeen was acquired for the programme by Tern Television who have produced the series since 1992. The new site covers 2.5 acres and is located at Grampian Regional Council Brotherfield Nursery, in Westhill, Aberdeenshire. Episodes were broadcast from the site in 1996. The show was once parodied in the BBC Scotland comedy sketch show Scotch and Wry, with Rikki Fulton as George Barron and Gregor Fisher as Jim McColl (dubbed the sunshine boyos) \\"growing\\" whisky. Since the 1980s, The Beechgrove Garden has been shown intermittently on the BBC in England usually in non-prime time slots during the day. Since 2013 The Beechgrove Garden has been broadcast in the rest of the UK, usually early on a Sunday morning slot. On 17 June 1983, the 100th show was broadcast. In 1990, the decision was made to redevelop the garden, which meant literally uprooting everything and starting again. It caused an outcry from the press and public, but it went ahead and led to a public auction for keepsake plants from The Beechgrove. There was even bigger change six years later, when the garden moved from its original home to an exposed, rural hillside on the outskirts of Aberdeen. In 1992, The Hit Squad with Jim McKirdy and Walter Gilmour was launched. They revamped gardens in need, according to presenter Jim McColl, they started all today's make-over shows. Episodes of the show have been transmitted across the world, from Canada, the Netherlands, Madeira, Italy and Jersey. The 1,000th episode was filmed in May 2016.

Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo Through its effect on the world's population and major artists in various fields, tuberculosis has influenced history. The disease was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities in its sufferers, and was known as \\"the romantic disease\\". Many artistic figures including the poet John Keats, the composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and the artist Edvard Munch either had the disease or were close to others who did. Tuberculosis played prominent and recurring roles in diverse fields. These included literature, as in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, set in a sanatorium; in music, as in Van Morrison's song \\"T.B. Sheets\\"; in opera, as in Puccini's La boh√®me and Verdi's La Traviata; in art, as in Monet's painting of his first wife Camille on her deathbed; and in film, such as the 1945 The Bells of St. Mary's starring Ingrid Bergman as a nun with tuberculosis. The disease also appears in fields such as anime and manga. Context The poet John Keats, here depicted by William Hilton c. 1822, died of tuberculosis aged 25. Tuberculosis, known variously as consumption, phthisis, and the great white plague, was long thought to be associated with poetic and artistic qualities in its sufferers, and was also known as \\"the romantic disease\\". Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frederic Chopin, the playwright Anton Chekhov, the novelists Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, the Bront√´ family, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham, and Robert Louis Stevenson, and the artists Alice Neel, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Elizabeth Siddal, Marie Bashkirtseff, Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley and Amedeo Modigliani either had the disease or were surrounded by people who did. A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent, as witness the number of great artists who were affected. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and the toxaemia caused by the disease, which allegedly helped them to see life more clearly and to act decisively. In 1680 John Bunyan referred to it as \\"the captain of all these men of death\\". Portrayals Opera The death of Antonia from tuberculosis in the original 1881 production of The Tales of Hoffmann. Several major operas have exploited the theme of heroines dying tragically of tuberculosis, including Mim√¨ in Puccini's opera La boh√®me. Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata features the consumptive Violetta Val√©ry, based on Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas, fils's 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam√©lias. In Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, Antonia has tuberculosis and is under the control of a Svengali- like quack doctor who forces her to sing herself to death by conjuring the shade of her dead mother, an opera singer. Numerous stage and film adaptations have been made, usually titled Camille or The Lady of the Camellias in English-language versions, and more loosely, as the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, where Satine dies of tuberculosis. The real life Paris courtesan Marie Duplessis, the historical Lady of the Camellias, died of the disease at age 23. Theatre A variety of plays have featured the theme of a character dying of tuberculosis. This includes Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, where the protagonist, Edmund, is diagnosed with tuberculosis at the start of the play; his mental anguish forms a substantial part of the drama. Chopin and The Nightingale is a dramatic reading with music in six acts by Cecilia and Jens Jorgensen for narrator, two sopranos and piano. It enacts the true-life romance of the composer Frederic Chopin, who had the disease, and \\"the Swedish nightingale\\"‚Äîthe singer Jenny Lind. Novels Victor Hugo's character Fantine (in his 1862 novel Les Miserables) with consumption in an 1886 painting by Margaret Bernadine Hall Nineteenth-century Russian literature frequently made use of characters with tuberculosis. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment; Kirillov in The Possessed, and both Ippolit and Marie in The Idiot. The disease features, too, in a variety of English novels of the Victorian era, including Charles Dickens's 1848 Dombey and Son, Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 North and South, and Mrs. Humphry Ward's 1900 Eleanor. When tuberculosis was essentially incurable, many patients stayed in a sanatorium for long periods. Several novels by different authors have been set in Swiss sanatoriums for tuberculosis sufferers, including Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, A. E. Ellis's The Rack, Liselotte Marshall's Tongue-Tied and Beatrice Harraden's Ships That Pass in the Night. In addition, W. Somerset Maugham's 1938 short story \\"Sanatorium\\" was set in the north of Scotland (based on his own experience in a Scottish sanatorium in 1919) Andrea Barrett's The Air We Breathe was set in upper New York State, and Linda Grant's The Dark Circle was set in the Kent countryside. Victor Hugo used the tuberculosis theme repeatedly: the disease is the likely cause of the spinal deformity of the hunchback in his 1831 novel Notre-Dame de Paris, while Fantine becomes ill and ultimately dies from consumption in his 1862 Les Miserables. Hammatt Billings's 1853 illustration of Eva, who romantically dies of consumption in Uncle Tom's Cabin Many other novels have tuberculosis as a major plot element. For example, The Constant Gardener by John le Carr√©, and its movie adaptation directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the tale of the testing of anti-tuberculosis drugs on unwitting subjects in Africa. Erich Maria Remarque's novel Three Comrades focuses on Patricia Hollman's love of life in light of her ultimately futile struggle with tuberculosis. In the 1915 novel Anne of the Island, the third in the Anne of Green Gables series, Ruby Gillis, one of Anne's childhood friends, dies of \\"the galloping consumption\\". Little Eva's romanticised death of consumption occurs over several chapters in Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The disease is not limited to human characters, but can help to achieve grim social realism in a novel. Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle portrays tuberculosis as common among cattle reaching the meat-packing plants of Chicago. Sinclair wrote that \\"men welcomed tuberculosis in the cattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly\\". Quote is from Chapter 9 of the novel. Some novels take a medical point of view on the disease, with doctors as major characters, and sometimes an intense use of medical language and procedure. For example, in A. J. Cronin's best-known novel, The Citadel (1937), made into a 1938 film of the same name by King Vidor, the idealistic protagonist, Dr. Andrew Manson, is dedicated to treating Welsh miners suffering from tuberculosis. He later assists a tuberculosis specialist in successfully performing a pneumothorax on a girl who is dying from the disease. Shame is brought to Sheilagh Fielding's Newfoundland family in Wayne Johnston's The Colony of Unrequited Dreams, as she has tuberculosis even though her father is a doctor. Nonfiction Among the many nonfiction treatments of tuberculosis, Illness as Metaphor by Susan Sontag (1979) compares the metaphorical portrayal of the disease to cancer. In his autobiography Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt portrays the prevalence and impact of consumption during his childhood in Ireland. In The Plague and I the author Betty MacDonald describes her nine months stay at a tuberculosis sanatorium and tuberculosis treatment in the pre-antibiotics era. Film Ingrid Bergman playing Sister Benedict, who contracts tuberculosis in the 1945 film The Bells of St. Mary's Many films have dramatised the effects of tuberculosis. In the 1936 film Camille Greta Garbo portrays Marguerite Gautier, who dies from the disease. In the 1945 film The Bells of St. Mary's, Ingrid Bergman portrays Sister Benedict, a nun who suffers from tuberculosis. Drunken Angel, a 1948 film by Akira Kurosawa, is the story of a doctor (Takashi Shimura) who is obsessed with curing tuberculosis in his patients, including a young yakuza (Toshir≈ç Mifune) whose illness is being used by his organization as a biological weapon. In the first Zatoichi movie (1962), Ichi's opponent Hirate has the disease, making him wish to die fighting Ichi. In the 1993 film Tombstone the character Doc Holliday is referred to as a \\"lunger\\", and tuberculosis motivates his actions throughout the film. He dies of consumption near the end. In the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures, directed by Peter Jackson and based on a true story, Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) had the disease, and her fear of being sent away 'for the good of her health' played a large role in determining subsequent actions. Jane Campion's 2009 film Bright Star describes the romantic relationship of Fanny Brawne and the poet John Keats, ending with Keats's death of the disease, aged 25. Fine art Claude Monet's 1879 Camille Monet sur son lit de mort Several major artists have depicted tuberculosis from their personal experience. Rembrandt's wife Saskia seems to have died of the disease aged 29; he drew her both when sick and on her deathbed. Edvard Munch returned to the theme many times in his career, including his paintings The Dead Mother and The Sick Child, of his mother and his sister Sophie, both of whom died of the disease. Claude Monet's Camille Monet sur son lit de mort shows his first wife Camille on her deathbed. Eugeen Van Mieghem's Facing Death depicts his wife Augustine lying sick with the disease. Alice Neel's 1940 painting T.B. Harlem depicts a tuberculosis ward in New York. The permanent collection of the American Visionary Art Museum contains a life-size applewood sculpture, Recovery, of a tuberculosis sufferer with a sunken chest. It is the only known work by an anonymous patient in an English asylum who died of the disease in the 1950s. Music A tuberculosis theme appears in Carl Michael Bellman's 1790 Fredman's Epistles, where the character Movitz catches the disease: Epistle no. 30 has the lines Movitz, din Lungsot, den drar dig i grafven (\\"Movitz, your consumption is taking you to the grave\\"). It appears, too, in American blues music. Jimmie Rodgers (1897‚Äì1933), country music singer, sang about the woes of his tuberculosis in the song \\"T.B. Blues\\" (co-written with Raymond E. Hall) which he recorded in 1931 at San Antonio, Texas. He also recorded Whippin' That Old T.B. in 1932, but ultimately died of the disease days after a New York City recording session. The tuberculosis theme is reworked in Van Morrison's song \\"T.B. Sheets\\", in which the narrator nurses a girl who is dying of tuberculosis. Anime and manga Tuberculosis also appears in anime and manga. For example, an early manga work by the influential author and illustrator Osamu Tezuka is named Tuberculosis. It tells the tale of a boy and his uncle who shrink to microscopic scale to fight the disease inside a child's body. Video games Tuberculosis plays a major role in the 2018 western video game Red Dead Redemption 2. In the game, the main character Arthur Morgan contracts the disease after an altercation with a diseased farmer, giving him only a short time to live. Faced with his own mortality, he reflects on his actions and how to protect the Van der Linde gang following his death, and tries to seek redemption for his past behaviour.

Covering an area of 2.5 million km2, the state is Australia's largest, accounting for almost one-third of the continent. Western Australia is the nation's fourth most populous state, with 2.6 million inhabitants (11% of the national population). In 2011, Western Australia provided 46% of Australia's merchandising exports. In 2010‚Äì11, Western Australia's gross state product was A$193 billion (14.6% of Australia's GDP), making it the nation's most productive state with a GSP per capita of $82,653 (compared with the national average of $57,925). If Western Australia were a separate country, it would be among the Top 50 economies in the world by GDP.  Structure   Overview  Western Australia's economy is largely driven by extraction and processing of a diverse range of mineral and petroleum commodities. The structure of the economy is closely linked to the abundance of natural resources found in the State, providing a comparative advantage in resource extraction and processing. As a consequence: * the Western Australian economy is more capital-intensive than all the other states. * Gross state product per person ($82,653) is higher than any other state and well above the national average ($57,925). * Diversification (i.e. a greater range of commodities) over the past 15 years has provided a more balanced production base and less reliance on just a few major export markets, insulating the economy from fluctuations in world prices (e.g. high oil and gas prices help sustain export income when prices of other commodities such as alumina and nickel fall) * There has been strong growth in the services (finance, insurance and property) and construction sector, which have increased their share of economic output. * Recent growth in global demand for minerals and petroleum, especially in China (iron-ore) and Japan (for LNG), has ensured economic growth above the national average. Western Australia's overseas merchandising exports accounted for 46% of the nation's total. The state's major export commodities include iron-ore, alumina, crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), nickel, gold, ammonia, wheat, wool, and live sheep and cattle. Western Australia has become known as the engine room of the Australian economy.  Resources  Western Australia's resource commodity mix, 2007. Major commodity mix, 2008‚Äì2009. In global terms, Western Australia is a significant producer of a wide range of resource commodities. Australia is the world's largest producer of both bauxite and alumina, with half of national production coming from Western Australia. Alcoa's Huntly mine provides the feedstock for its three refineries at Wagerup, Pinjarra and Kwinana. Worsley Alumina transports bauxite from its Boddington mine to its refinery at Worsley via a 51 km conveyor belt. It is the world's third-largest iron-ore producer (15% of the world's total) and extracts 75% of Australia's 240 tonnes of gold. Diamonds are extracted at Argyle diamond mine in far north of the Kimberley region. Coal mined at Collie is the main fuel for baseload electricity generation in the state's south- west. Australia is the world's fifth largest exporter of LNG, most of which is produced by the North West Shelf Venture near Karratha. Resource sector growth in recent years has resulted in significant labour and skills shortages,Westjobs leading to recent efforts by the state government to encourage interstate and overseas immigration. According to the Feb 2012 statistical data, the average full-time adult weekly income was A$1,617.90 in Western Australia (compared to A$1,406.80 in Australia as a whole). Recent growth has also contributed to significant rises in average property values in 2006, although values plateaued in 2007. Perth property prices are still the second highest in Australia behind Sydney, and high rental prices continue to be a problem. A lot of this has to do with the Mining Industry being so strong in WA.Mining Jobs WA. FIFO Mining Jobs. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.  Agriculture  Agricultural production in WA is a major contributor to the state and national economy. Although tending to be highly seasonal, 2006-07 wheat production in WA was nearly 10 million tonnes, accounting for almost half the nation's total. and providing $1.7 billion in export income. Other significant farm output includes barley, peas, wool, lamb and beef. There is a high level of overseas demand for imports of live animals from WA, driven mainly by South East Asia's feedlots and Middle Eastern countries, where cultural and religious traditions and a lack of storage and refrigeration facilities favour live animals over imports of processed meat. Approximately 50% of Australia's live cattle exports come from Western Australia.  Wine  Western Australia has major wine producing regions in the South West located in Margaret River, the Great Southern and the Swan Valley. Several wineries produce wine for local consumption and international export.  Fishing  Western Australia has a significant fishing industry. Products for local consumption and export include Western Rock Lobsters, prawns, crabs, shark and tuna. Processing is conducted along the west coast. Whaling ceased at Albany in 1978.  Manufacturing  South of Perth is the heavy industrial area of Kwinana. Located here is the nation's largest oil refinery which produces petrol and diesel for local consumption, an iron plant, alumina and nickel processing, port facilities for grain exports, and support industries for mining and petroleum such as heavy and light engineering, and metal fabrication. Shipbuilding (e.g. Austal Ships) and associated support industries are found at nearby Henderson, just south of Fremantle. Significant secondary industries include cement and building product manufacturing, flour milling, food processing, animal feed production, automotive body building, and printing.  Tourism  In recent years, tourism has grown in importance, with significant numbers of visitors to the state coming from the UK (27.8%), other European countries (13.6%) Singapore (16.5%), Japan (10.1%) and Malaysia (8.3%). Tourists from China increased 50% between 2011 and 2012, from 22,000 to 33,000. Revenue from tourism is a strong economic driver in many of the smaller population centres outside of Perth, especially in coastal locations. Total international visitors to WA is currently increasing above the national average - for the year ending June 2011 there were 735,900 international visitors, a growth of 5.3% for WA compared to a growth of 3.4% nationally. They spent in total A$1.94 billion, up 9.4% from the previous year. against a national average growth rate of 4.3%. In addition, nights stayed by international visitors was up 5.6% (+3.8% nationally), with a 22% increase in international business visitors (121,400 people). The largest spike in international visitors came from Indonesia (+26.4%), USA (+23.0%), New Zealand (+19.9%) and Malaysia (+15.5%). The biggest decreases in visitor numbers to Western Australia by country was Korea (-25.7%), South Africa (-21.1%), Netherlands (-17,9%) and Canada (-14%). . Overall Western Australia had an estimated 7,000,000 overnight visitors to the State for the year ending December 2012, with 5,160,000 coming from intrastate, 1,112,000 from interstate, and 760,800 from overseas, making Western Australia's tourism industry worth approximately A$6 billion in total.  Economic history   Foundation (1829 to 1850)  The British Government founded the Swan River Colony in 1829 with the intention of establishing the colony with an agricultural and pastoral base. The poor quality land‚Äîparticularly in the region in close proximity of the coast‚Äîand an inadequate labour supply and infrastructure hindered the expansion of the economy.  Convictism and the gold boom (1850 to 1913)  The Swan River colony was not intended to be a penal colony but, in 1848, the introduction of convicts from Britain was sought to provide much needed labour and income from the British government. These were to be males, so an immigration program was also funded to redress gender imbalance. Prior to this, population and the economy had stagnated. By 1870 the European population had tripled and was reaching 20 000, around half of these were convicts. This allowed the establishment of smaller industries and reduced the reliance on imports. The new labour pool was utilised in new Public Works. The colony began attaining a greater level of financial independence. The discovery of gold in this period also increased the population. Migration from the eastern states, where a post gold rush economic slump existed, and from overseas increased sharply. While much of the revenue generated was retained by the British crown, some was directed toward creating infrastructure in the state. New towns, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, were established at the goldfields and the remote northern town of Roebourne and its port Cossack were boosted by the associated economic boom. The city of Perth and the port of Fremantle, Western Australia were also invigorated by the new economy.  World Wars and Depression (1913 to 1946)  The First World War (1914‚Äì1918) had a disruptive impact on economic development.Anthony Moran, Australia. New York: Routledge, 2004. Wartime conditions ensured high prices for agricultural products, but also created inflationary pressures and manpower shortages, while the completion of the transcontinental rail link in 1917 highlighted growing integration into the national economy and a decline in dependence on Britain.David Day, Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia. Pymble, Sydney, New South Wales: HarperCollins, 2001. In 1919 the state government sought to resume economic growth through the introduction of soldier-settlement in the south-west region. However, initial enthusiasm waned in the face of concerns about the feasibility of the proposed program, while Labour unrest raised concerns about the ability of the state government to manage this program. Undeterred the Nationalist government of James Mitchell pressed ahead. Indeed, Mitchell's enthusiasm was such that his critics soon dubbed him \\"Moo-Cow\\" Mitchell. Unfortunately soldier-settlement soon ran into problems, cost the state over ¬£5 million, and led to the defeat of the Mitchell government at the polls in 1924.Phillip Knightley, Australia: A Biography of a Nation. London: Vintage, 2001. Given the economic importance of agriculture and the debts incurred in the 1920s it was not surprising that the Great Depression had a major impact on WA.Andrew Beer, Maude Aleric and William Pritchard, Developing Australia‚Äôs Regions: Theory and Practice. Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2003. Falling prices for agricultural goods hit farming areas hard leading to a further fall in demand, rising unemployment and much hardship. It was only after the Labor government of Philip Collier accepted the Premier's Plan and agricultural prices began to rise that the economy recovered. Even so, unemployment in WA did not fall below 10% until the outbreak of war in 1939.Stuart Macintyre, A Concise History of Australia. 2nd. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. World War II had a much more dramatic impact on the economy than the previous war. It immediately stimulated industry and agriculture effectively ending the Depression. After the introduction of manpower controls and conscription a severe manpower shortage developed that would continue into the 1950s. During the war the Labor governments of John Willcock and Frank Wise actively promoted industrial growth in the industrial areas of Midland and Welshpool, and was effective in mobilising the population to support the war effort. In addition port facilities in Fremantle and the air transport facilities in Perth were expanded to cope with wartime needs. To balance these developments the attacks of the Imperial Japanese Forces on the north of Western Australia caused much of the existing economic infrastructure of towns like Wyndham, Derby and Port Hedland to be destroyed.Goeffrey Blainey, This Land Is All Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions. Sydney: ABC Publications, 2001.  Post-war era (1946 to present)  The post-war period saw sustained growth in the Western Australia economy. Successful economic development ultimately culminated in the Australian Grants Commission removing its designation of WA as a \\"claimant\\" state in 1971. By the early 21st century WA was no longer regarded as a \\"Cinderella State\\" within the Australian Commonwealth, but the centre of the mining and pastoral industries, and the hub of the export boom.Geoffrey Blainey. This Land Is All Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions. Sydney: ABC Publications, 2001. During the immediate post-war period WA greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of federal involvement in the economy. The establishment of Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), the nationalisation of Qantas, and setting up of a national shipping line ensured that transport links with the other states were greatly strengthened. The launching of a mass migration program in 1946 under the slogan of \\"populate or perish\\" eased manpower shortages, and boosted the WA population.Ann Capling, All the Way with the USA: Australia, the US and Free Trade. Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2004. The federal housing agreement of 1947 allowed the state government to proceed with a program of public housing construction and expansion which saw the Perth metropolitan area double in size between 1945 and 1960.Don Aitkin, What Was It All For? The Reshaping of Australia. Crow‚Äôs Nest, New South Wales: Allen and Unwin, 2005. Finally the success of the government of Ross McLarty in attracting foreign investment culminated in the signing of an agreement with BP to establish an oil refinery at the new industrial area of Kwinana (south of Fremantle).George Megalogenis, From Growth to Greed. Melbourne: Scribe, 2006, . The lifting of the federal ban on the export of iron-ore in 1960 further boosted the economy. Rapidly increasing industrial and mining production fueled the rise of suburbanisation and consumerism in Perth and regional centres in the 1960s and 1970s. The Liberal governments of David Brand and Charles Court encouraged these developments. Foreign investment and the increase in the tax base was also used to modernise existing infrastructure. In the 1960s a metropolitan freeway system was constructed to link South Perth and Fremantle with the rapidly growing northern suburbs of Perth. Suburban shopping centres were built in Floreat, Morley, Forrestfield and Midland. A new container port facility was built in North Fremantle, Perth Airport was re-built and progressively the tram-trolley bus network was closed down.F.G. Clarke, The History of Australia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2002. In contrast to the economic development goals of successive Liberal governments, the Labor administrations of Albert Hawke, John Tonkin and Brian Burke focused more on the development of education and social services infrastructure. In particular the Hawke government commenced a mass expansion of the state high school system, while the Tonkin government funded the opening of a second state university in 1973‚Äì74. The development of regional centres was also encouraged as government funding was directed towards the upgrading of the port of Cockburn, the Stirling Naval base and the mining communities of Newman and Meekatharra. Much of the economic development in the 1960s and 1970s was sponsored by Japanese investors, especially in the iron-ore sector, while American and British investment remained centred in the pastoral, agricultural and construction sectors. From the 1990s China emerged as a major market for WA goods and as a potential investor. State and federal government of major public works continued despite some evidence of local maladministration during the \\"WA Inc\\" years of the late 1980s. Thus the early years of the 21st century saw the completion of the Ord River Project in the north-west and the rapid expansion of the Perth metropolitan rail and freeway networks. In 2003, the State Government launched a Buy WA First campaign to support the State's economy.

Opened in 1933, it is the home field of the California Golden Bears of the Pac-12, with a seating capacity of 2,500. Evans Diamond is located in the UC sports complex in the southwest corner of campus, pressed between George C. Edwards Stadium to the west (right field) and Haas Pavilion to the east. History Originally named Edwards Field, it was renamed after Clint Evans, the Cal head coach from 1930‚Äì54. The stadium was renovated in 1992 at a cost of $275,000, paid for by the donations of UC alumni. Construction was done by RNT Landscaping, a San Leandro landscaping company. thumb The turf at Evans Diamond is natural grass, and the infield dirt is a combination of crushed cinder and the traditional clay. The outfield wall is 320 feet (98 m) from home plate in the corners, 365 feet (111 m) in the power alleys, and 395 feet (120 m) in center field. In the right field corner are the batting cages and pitching machines, covered by a roof (but not enclosed); the bullpen is outside of the roof, closer to the warning track. In the left field corner is the other bullpen, without batting cages. Both bullpens are separated from the field of play by fences. The Jackie Jensen press box lies directly behind home plate, above the last row of stands. Beyond the left field wall is Bancroft Way, the southern border of the UC campus. Beyond the right field wall is the concrete grandstand for the track stadium. The baseball field has an unorthodox orientation, with the catcher and batter (and fans) facing southwest, into the mid-afternoon sun. (The optimal orientation of a baseball diamond is east-northeast.)MLB.com - playing field orientation Future Evans Diamond is in need of major renovations because the stadium is no longer considered up to the standards needed to host NCAA tournament games. This was a problem as recently as 2011, when the Golden Bears had to host their 2011 Super Regional vs. Dallas Baptist University at Stephen Schott Stadium in Santa Clara. One of the Cal Baseball Foundation's primary goals is to see improvements at Evans Diamond including the addition of field lights so the stadium can host night baseball games.http://calbaseballfoundation.org/the-foundation/our-goals/ In the near future, the facility will also have to be able to host large television crews to accommodate the newly created Pac-12 Network. Before California baseball's alumni game on October 21, 2012, it was announced that Evans Diamond will receive lights and a new video and scoreboard by the first conference games in 2013.http://cal.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1425379 For the first time in the venue's history, Evans Diamond will be able to host night games during the 2013 season.

The settlement has a long history previously being known as Summerhill within the parish of New Machar, later being renamed Newmachar. Some buildings retain the split name \\"New Machar\\" to this day including the primary school and church. The population, approximately 2,500., Aberdeenshire Settlements Population 2016, is served by one shop, two public houses, a primary school, a bowling club and, a football club.  History   Etymology  The name originates from the original parish created in 1609, from part of the parish of St Machar's Cathedral. The name refers specifically to the village, originally known as Summerhill, with the surrounding parish being correctly known as New Machar. In 1928, the name Summerhill was changed to Newmachar, which was also the name of the railway station serving the village.  Railways  The Newmachar railway station, on the Formartine and Buchan Railway, closed in 1965.  Auxiliary Units (World War II)  During World War II Winston Churchill initiated the forming of a British resistance force called Auxiliary Units. These units were put together in top secret, and were selected from areas that could be used to benefit from guerilla warfare. Typically, these units (called patrols) were made up from farmers, gamekeepers and estate workers. Newmachar had one of these patrols that were tasked with destroying the main railways to Inverness, and the Buchan line to Fraserburgh and Peterhead, also RAF Dyce and bridges over the River Don. Research by C.A.R.T has revealed the patrol members and also the location of the Operational Base. The Operational Base was built underground to house up to 8 patrol members who, when the Invasion came would go into hiding for 7‚Äì14 days before coming out at night to attack \\"targets of opportunity\\", including assassinations of key individuals (both local and enemy personnel). Aux unit members had a life expectancy of up to 2 weeks after an invasion. All the members had to sign the official secrets act, and were trained at Blairmore House near Huntly.

Background The UVF emerged in the late 1960s, at the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as the Troubles. The UVF's claimed goal was to fight Irish republicanism ‚Äì particularly the Irish Republican Army (IRA) ‚Äì and maintain Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom.Country Reports on Terrorism: 2004. State Department, Office of the Coordinator for Conterterrorism. p.128 Most of its victims were innocent Catholic civilians, who were often killed at random. Whenever it claimed responsibility for attacks, the UVF usually claimed that those targeted were IRA members or were helping the IRA.Kentucky New Era, 14 April 1992 Other times, attacks on Catholic civilians were claimed as \\"retaliation\\" for IRA actions, since the IRA drew almost all of its support from the Catholic population. Since the 1970s, the UVF had carried out many gun and bomb attacks on Catholic-owned pubs and there had been many incidents of collusion between the UVF and members of the state security forces. During the early 1990s, loyalists drastically increased their attacks on Catholics and Irish nationalists and ‚Äì for the first time since the conflict began ‚Äì were responsible for more deaths than republicans or the security forces.\\"Johnny Adair: Feared Loyalist Leader\\", BBC News, 6 July 2000.

On 16 June 1994, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) killed three UVF members ‚Äì Trevor King, Colin Craig and David Hamilton ‚Äì in a drive-by shooting on the Shankill Road in Belfast. Senior UVF members had been meeting in a building nearby. According to one senior member, after this attack the UVF called on its members to retaliate, for there to be \\"blood on the streets\\" and to \\"kill any Catholic\\" they could.2nd Police Ombudsman's report. 9 June 2016. p.81 The following day, the UVF launched two 'retaliatory' attacks. In the first, UVF members shot dead a Catholic civilian taxi driver in Carrickfergus. In the second, they shot dead two Protestant civilians in Newtownabbey, whom they believed were Catholics. The Loughinisland shootings, a day later, are believed to have been further retaliation. Pub attack The pub in 2009 On the evening of 18 June 1994, about 24 people were gathered in The Heights Bar (also known as O'Toole's Pub) watching the Republic of Ireland vs Italy in the FIFA World Cup. At 10:10 p.m., two UVF members wearing boiler suits and balaclavas walked into the bar.

The dead were Adrian Rogan (34), Malcolm Jenkinson (52), Barney Green (87), Daniel McCreanor (59), Patrick O'Hare (35) and Eamon Byrne (39), all Catholic civilians. O'Hare was the brother-in-law of Eamon Byrne and Green was one of the oldest people to be killed during the Troubles. The UVF claimed responsibility within hours of the attack.

Local Protestant families visited their wounded neighbours in hospital, expressing their shock and disgust. Aftermath The massacre ultimately led to a temporary return to tit-for-tat violence.McDonald and Cusack, pp. 259‚Äì70 The following month, the IRA shot dead three high- ranking members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the other main loyalist paramilitary group alongside the UVF.

The Office of the Police Ombudsman, which investigated the police over the massacre In 2008 it was revealed that, since the shootings, up to 20 people had been arrested for questioning but none had ever been charged. In January 2010 a reserve Police Service of Northern Ireland officer (formerly an RUC officer) was arrested by detectives from the Police Ombudsman's Office and questioned over \\"perverting the course of justice\\" and \\"aiding the killers' escape\\". Later that year, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) concluded there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute. In reply, the Ombudsman's Office said it would consider disciplinary action against the officer. First Police Ombudsman's report In September 2009 it was revealed that a Police Ombudsman's report on the killings was to be published on 15 September. At the same time, some details of the report were made known. Police sources said the report would expose the role of four RUC informers in \\"ordering or organising\\" the attack. The report was also said to highlight a series of major failings in the police investigation ‚Äì including that not enough effort was made to identify those responsible, that police failed to speak to people of interest, that key evidence was destroyed and that there was poor record management. Shortly after these revelations, the Ombudsman postponed publication of the report as \\"new evidence\\" had emerged. The Ombudsman's report was finally published on 24 June 2011. It said that the police investigation had lacked \\"diligence, focus and leadership\\"; that there were failings in record management; that significant lines of enquiry were not identified; and that police failed to communicate effectively with the victims' families. It said that there was \\"insufficient evidence of collusion\\" and \\"no evidence that police could have prevented the attack\\".

He was a pioneer of the electric bass guitar and possibly the first to record on it when he recorded with Art Farmer in 1953. He was the brother of jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery and vibraphonist Buddy Montgomery. Biography Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, into a musical family, Monk had three brothers and a sister. His older brother Thomas played drums, and died at 16. Monk gave his younger brother Wes (born 1923) a tenor guitar when Wes was 11 or 12. Wes took up the electric guitar at age 19 and went on to major success. The youngest brother, Buddy (born 1930) played piano and later took up the vibraphone. Their younger sister, Ervena (Lena), also played piano. Monk himself did not take up the double bass until he was 30, after hearing one of Wes' groups perform. The three brothers released a number of albums together as the Montgomery Brothers, also playing together on some albums credited to Wes. Also Buddy and Monk recorded many albums together in their group The Mastersounds. He is perhaps the first electric bassist of significance to jazz, taking up the Fender Precision Bass in 1952 or '53 after replacing Roy Johnson in the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. He said his biggest influences as a bassist were Jimmy Blanton, Ray Brown, and Charles Mingus.Interview by Mike Newman, Guitar Player magazine, September 1977 Monk played electric bass with his thumb (brother Wes, played electric guitar with his thumb, also) and adapted his jazz playing from double bass to electric. In the 1960s he took up Fender Jazz Bass, playing with a felt pick. His professional career did not start until he was 30, and after his younger brother Wes. Monk worked in a foundry and played gigs on upright bass at night in Indianapolis. Wes worked for vibraphonist Lionel Hampton from 1948‚Äì1950, Monk then worked for Hampton around 1952‚Äì1953, with Hampton insisting he play the Fender bass, and not an upright. Monk's recordings with The Art Farmer Septet on 2 July 1953, arranged by Quincy Jones, are possibly the earliest studio recordings of the electric bass, and display his facility with walking bass lines, bebop melodies, and Latin-style ostinato. Chuck Rainey said that Monk was the first electric bassist to record, in any genre.Interview with Chuck Rainey, Bass Heroes, ed. Tom Mulhern, 1993, pp165. A live recording of Montgomery with the Hampton orchestra from April 1953 may exist.https://artfarmer.org/art-farmer-discography-1948-1957/ Monk toured and recorded in Europe with Hampton in late 1953. After that he worked briefly with the Anthony Ortega Quartet in Los Angeles, and then with his brothers in the Montgomery-Johnson Quintet in Indianapolis (with Alonzo \\"Pookie\\" Johnson, sax, and Robert \\"Sonny\\" Johnson, drums). In 1955 he moved to Seattle to form The Mastersounds from 1957 to 1960. In 1964‚Äì65 Montgomery played on two albums by The Jazz Crusaders, and members of that band would go on to produce and play on his first two solo albums. Later, from 1966 to 1970, he freelanced with vibraphonist Cal Tjader and continued to play where he settled in Las Vegas, Nevada, with The Red Norvo Trio until 1972. Between 1969 and 1974 he released four solo albums. In 1970 he recorded in Los Angeles with South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. In 1974 Monk toured South Africa with a group including singer Lovelace Watkins, and Monk recorded his final solo album Monk Montgomery in Africa...Live! in Soweto. In 1976 he served on the Jazz Advisory Panel for the National Endowment for the Arts with Benny Carter, George Russell, Muhal Richard Abrams, and others.Ebony magazine, December 1976 In 1977 he helped organise the inaugural Maseru Music Festival in Lesotho which included Dizzy Gillespie, students and staff from Rutgers University and local musicians.Billboard, 10 December 1977, \\"US Musicians at Lesotho Jazz Fest\\", Hanford SearlBillboard, 28 January 1978, \\"Good things stem from Lesotho\\", Hanford Searl In his final years he was active in the Las Vegas Jazz Society, which he founded, he also presented a local radio show. He had also been planning a world jazz festival. In 1981 he became the founding president of the Western Federation for Jazz. Montgomery died of cancer in Las Vegas on May 20, 1982.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. She debuted in 1987 as the G.I. Joe Team's female ninja character, and since then her code name has been the identity of several other incarnations of the same character, including one of Snake Eyes' apprentices in G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, Chuckles' undercover contact in G.I. Joe: Cobra, and Storm Shadow's cousin in G.I. Joe: Renegades. She is portrayed by √âlodie Yung in the 2013 film G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Profile In G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Jinx is one of the few G.I. Joe Team members whose real name is top secret. She has been studying and competing in several forms of martial arts since she was seven. She grew up in Los Angeles and is a Bryn Mawr graduate. On a vacation trip to Japan, Jinx discovered her familial ties to a ninja clan known as the Arashikage, and was officially initiated into the clan. She was then recruited by Snake Eyes, a fellow ninja and member of the G.I. Joe Team. Jinx has since undergone training with the Blind Master, a ranking ninja sensei, and studied the seven silent forms, including the \\"Eye That Pierces\\", the \\"Iron Hand\\" and the \\"Heart That Waits\\". After the temporary dissolution of the G.I. Joe Team, Jinx became a freelance agent, and is believed to have spent time serving in the CIA. She also started a romantic relationship with her teammate Budo, and the two of them formed a successful bounty hunting business together. When the team was reinstated, Jinx returned to help train new recruits in hand-to-hand combat. Toys Jinx was first released as an action figure in the 1987 edition of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline. Like many of the female G.I. Joe characters, Jinx has had a relatively small number of action figures produced. As of 2011, she has had one 3 3/4-inch figure named Jinx, and two 3 3/4-inch figures named \\"Agent Jinx\\". The first of these was released in 2003 as a member of Tiger Force, and the second (\\"Covert Infiltration Specialist\\") released in 2004 actually reveals her face, but her real name is still classified. In 2011, a new Jinx figure was announced for the exclusive pre-release by the official G.I. Joe Collectors' Club. Two new 3 3/4-inch figures of \\"Kim Arashikage\\" were announced to be released in the G.I. Joe: Retaliation 2012 Movie Line exclusively at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2012: an updated version in a red ninja suit, and an unmasked variant of her wearing a white costume and wielding a kusarigama. In 2013, a Kim Arashikage figure was released with a red outfit as a G.I. Joe Collectors' Club exclusive. Another Kim Arashikage figure was released the same year as part of the G.I. Joe: Retaliation line, outfitted in her black-and-yellow ninja outfit from the live-action film. A Jinx figure was also released in the Kre-O G.I. Joe line in 2013. Comics Marvel Comics In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series, Jinx first appears in issue #59. Her first assignment is to train Cobra Commander's son Billy Kessler in San Francisco. She later helps rescue the captured Joes from Borovia‚Äôs gulags. In subsequent appearances, she helps the Joes clear their name in the scandal that follows the Cobra Civil War. This involves working with ex-Joes like Grunt, as well as other Joes who are officially fugitives such as Roadblock, and eventually the entire Joe team raids an enemy-filled hospital to save the lives of General Hawk and General Hollingsworth. Jinx also appears in some of the Special Mission specials, such as when she helps to stop a hostage situation in Frankfurt. Jinx eventually becomes a member of the G.I. Joe special team Ninja Force. After fighting together with Storm Shadow against Zartan in San Francisco, Jinx and Scarlett are injured during a battle against the rival Red Ninjas. Later, Jinx and her fellow Ninja Force teammates T'Jbang and Nunchuk set up a new training center in Spanish Harlem. She continued serving in Ninja Force until G.I. Joe was disbanded. Devil's Due Publishing In the first four issues of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero comics published by Devil's Due, it is revealed that she spent the years that followed using her skills in intelligence-gathering to become a bounty hunter in Tokyo. A samurai and fellow Joe teammate Budo followed her and they became lovers. Jinx then rejoins G.I. Joe, when the team is reinstated to battle a revived Cobra. During the initial conflict, Duke leads a team with Jinx, Flint, Rock 'n Roll and Shipwreck to defend Washington D.C. against Cobra's forces. Later, she spies on a group of Dreadnoks attempting to purchase a nuclear weapon. She works with several other Joes, such as Heavy Duty and Lady Jaye to try and bring down an out-of-control Battle Android Trooper. Jinx also trains new recruits, and goes on a mission to Seattle. Later, she is part of an infiltration team sent in to sabotage Cobra Island during the second Cobra Civil War. Two members of her team, Flash and Mainframe, die during the mission. Jinx and T'Jbang are injured in a battle with the Red Ninjas in Tibet. When G.I. Joe commander Hawk is shot by Zartan, the team is disbanded once more. After some time, the G.I. Joe team reforms with a much smaller group of specialists called \\"America‚Äôs Elite\\" (G.I. Joe: America's Elite). Jinx serves as a member of the reserves. She stars in Special Missions: Tokyo, a one-shot comic focusing on many characters not seen since the end of the original series, including Wild Bill, Gung-Ho, Clutch, Rock 'n Roll, and Budo. Her profile in the comic reveals her name to be Kimi Arashikage, cousin of Tommy Arashikage (Storm Shadow). However, it states that \\"Kimi\\" might be just a nickname. Jinx is called again into active duty to fight off Cobra Commander's worldwide assault during World War III. She and Budo join Kamakura, Bullhorn, Red Spot, and Nunchuk in battling Cobra forces in China. After Cobra is defeated, Jinx, Budo, and Kamakura join in celebrations taking place in Beijing. Jinx also appears in the comic specials G.I. Joe: Arashikage Showdown, and Snake Eyes: Declassified, as well as in ninja-themed miniseries G.I. Joe: Master & Apprentice, and G.I. Joe: Master & Apprentice II. She makes a cameo in the crossover miniseries G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers II. Hasbro later announced that all stories published by Devil's Due Publishing are no longer considered canonical, and are now considered an alternate continuity. IDW Publishing In the continuation of the A Real American Hero storyline by IDW Publishing, Jinx is sent on her own special mission to Bern, where she tests her new skills and defeats the Blue Ninjas. Later Jinx, Chuckles, Low Light and Lady Jaye go to fight Generalissimo Tep in South-East Asia, where Jinx rescues Lady Jaye from captivity. Jinx is teamed with the Arashikage ninja Pale Peony, with whom she is sent on undercover missions against the Blue Ninjas and their cyborgs. She is in turn herself rescued by Roadblock, Scarlett, and Snake Eyes in Dublin, and helps to avenge the death of Pale Peony. Following the purported death of Snake Eyes, Jinx reunites with Storm Shadow at the Arashikage compound. She later works with Scarlett, investigating the office building that was a former Cobra Headquarters. In the G.I. Joe: Cobra miniseries, Jinx is a Chinese-American woman who is Chuckles' only contact with G.I. Joe, and also his romantic interest, as he infiltrates the Cobra organization. When he gets deeper inside Cobra, she is forced to cut off her meetings with him. However, when Cobra catches Jinx at one of their facilities. Chuckles is called in, and when they discover she has been following him, he is forced to shoot her in order to preserve his cover. The sequel G.I. Joe: Cobra II, features a new recruit who is a Jinx lookalike, sent on a mission to rescue Chuckles, and later revealed to be a Japanese ninja named Chameleon. Chuckles later avenges Jinx's death, destroying Cobra headquarters and killing thousands of Cobra soldiers and commanders including Xamot. Jinx appears in the Danger Girl crossover miniseries Danger Girl/G.I. Joe. Jinx is also a major character in the Transformers crossover series, Transformers vs. G.I. Joe. In the Future Noir series comic \\"Deviations\\", Jinx is one of the last four Joes remaining alive after Cobra takes over the world, and dies while destroying Cobra Island. In the Street Fighter crossover series Street Fighter X G.I. Joe, Jinx plays a leading role, as she trains with and defeats Ryu, and then defeats Rufus. Eventually, she fights in the final duel against M. Bison, whom she also beats, thus winning the World Warrior tournament. Other comics Jinx appears as one of the main characters in the Blackthorne Publishing series G.I. Joe In 3-D. She and Snake Eyes star in Hasbro's standalone comics, such as The Secret Base, Ninja Battles, and Who Owns the Night? Jinx also appears in major roles in some of Fun Publications' comics that are a part of the Devil's Due Publishing continuity. Animated series Sunbow Jinx's only appearance in the Sunbow canon, was in the 1987 animated film G.I. Joe: The Movie, voiced by Shuko Akune. She is established as a member of the \\"Rawhides\\", a group of new Joe recruits including Big Lob, Chuckles, Law & Order and Tunnel Rat, trained by Beach Head. The film plays off her code name in a literal sense, as she is often blamed for unlucky occurrences. She is also Lt. Falcon‚Äôs love interest, and features prominently in the climax, when she hotwires a Tomahawk so the Rawhides can aid the Joes in combat, and later squares off against Cobra-La villainess Pythona. Jinx is depicted as fighting best when blindfolded, as she was trained in this method by the Blind Master. Valor vs. Venom Jinx returns in the 2004 direct-to-video animated film G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom, voiced by Venus Terzo. Her original background with the Blind Master is not mentioned, instead she is training along with Kamakura under Snake Eyes, and likes to rib Kamakura for his lesser experience. Because of the nature of the movie, it is hard to determine if she is an apprentice for the first time, or is learning a new level of skills, as she does seem to be a very seasoned ninja. Ninja Battles In the 2004 animated feature G.I. Joe: Ninja Battles, Venus Terzo reprises her role as Jinx. Set in the same continuity as Valor Vs. Venom, Jinx and Kamakura assists Snake Eyes, Duke, and new apprentice Tiger Claw in a battle against Storm Shadow and the Cobra ninjas Slice, Slash, and Shadow Strike, at the forge of Arashikage Clan swordsmith Iron Master. Sigma 6 In the 2005 anime series G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, Jinx is voiced by Lisa Ortiz. A reserve member of the young Sigma 6 team, she maintains a similar appearance to her Valor vs. Venom incarnation, with a black and yellow Sigma suit. It is more apparent in the series that she is an elder student over Kamakura, whom she is often partnered with. Renegades A different version of Jinx appears in the 2010 animated series G.I. Joe: Renegades, voiced by Kim Mai Guest. The daughter of Arashikage clan leader Hard Master and cousin to Storm Shadow, Kimi Arashikage was rescued by Snake Eyes at the age of eight, and was an instrumental part of Hard Master adopting a moral path for the clan when she protected Snake Eyes from her father's punishment. When Hard Master was killed, Snake Eyes and Kimi left the clan to a dojo in the mountains. She became Snake Eyes' apprentice and took the name of \\"Jinx\\". After Storm Shadow tells her how Snake Eyes murdered her father, as he believed it to have occurred, Jinx returns to Japan to assume her role as the Arashikage's leader.G.I. Joe: Renegades episodes \\"Return of the Arashikage (Part I)\\" and \\"Return of the Arashikage (Part II)\\". Later, Jinx is hired by Destro to assassinate Cobra Commander, receiving a MARS high-tech suit with optical camouflage and force field. Not going through with the mission, Jinx eventually learns the true story behind her father's death, and resolves to lead the Arashikage down the new path that the Hard Master wanted.G.I. Joe: Renegades episode \\"Cutting Edge\\". Live action film In June 2011, French actress √âlodie Yung was cast as Jinx for the 2013 film G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Jinx was featured in the first promotional pictures and trailer, shown sparring against Snake Eyes while clad in red and blindfolded, and fighting together with him against the Red Ninjas while wearing a yellow suit. Yung, who already owned a black belt in karate, prepared for about a month for the role, focusing on her cardio \\"because of how demanding it all was\\", and training in the Chinese martial art wushu for dual sword fighting. The cliff battle scene required two months of green screen work to be done. Yung also said: \\"I was wearing a yellow costume that got pretty hot. It looks sexy, but I needed five people to get into that suit.\\" According to MTV, \\"the totally silent mountainside battle between Snake Eyes, Jinx and a squad of Cobra ninjas mirrors the similarly silent comic book issue in the original Marvel series, which depicts Snake Eyes rescuing Scarlett from a Cobra castle in the Balkans.\\" In Retaliation, Jinx is Storm Shadow's cousin, and the apprentice of Snake Eyes. The Blind Master, leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes and Jinx to locate Storm Shadow, so he can answer for the murder of his uncle the Hard Master. Snake Eyes and Jinx capture Storm Shadow after a battle with ninjas, and take him back to Japan, where Storm Shadow reveals that Zartan murdered the Hard Master, and that he joined Cobra to avenge his uncle. Storm Shadow then accompanies Snake Eyes and Jinx, as they join the Joes' efforts to stop Cobra. Jinx helps G.I. Joe fight Cobra's soldiers, but Cobra Commander escapes during the battle, and Storm Shadow disappears after avenging his uncle. Jinx is then recruited into the G.I. Joe Team. Ray Park, who played Snake Eyes in the film, said that the relationship between Jinx and his character is strictly platonic. Yung said about her character: \\"Jinx wants to fight and she has an objective, and she‚Äôs fiery [laughs]. Whoever is in her way is not a problem to her, she‚Äôs so focused and she just wants to get straight to the point. And with Snake Eyes, he‚Äôs such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he‚Äôs become an icon, he‚Äôs a role model. He‚Äôs Snake Eyes, he‚Äôs the coolest, he‚Äôs the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test that they have in the beginning she wants to win and she wants to prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him. There is a kind of a brother and sister relationship that we tried to instill during the film.\\" In other media Jinx is a supporting character in the 1988 novels Divide and Conquer, where she is part of the Joe team trying to stop Cobra's newest weapon, a device that could endanger the entire world, and Jungle Raid, where she is part of a team ordered to stop a rebel mercenary force in the steaming jungles of South America. In video games, Jinx was one of the 15 playable characters (and the first one to be revealed) in the 2013 Facebook game G.I. Joe: Special Ops by Syfy Games,G.I. Joe Special Ops: G.I. Joe Personnel: JINX Syfy Games and was also a recruitable soldier in the 2013 mobile game G.I. Joe: Battleground by DeNA.

The name of the company is a joining of both companies‚Äô names. Through the years the company had interests in electronics, home appliances (refrigeration and air conditioning), telecommunications, batteries, medical systems and defence electronics. The company does not exist as a conglomerate anymore. The brand name survived through the former conglomerate's many spin-offs and sold divisions. They include: * Tadiran Telecom * Tadiran Telecommunications * Tadiran Batteries * Tadiran Air Conditioners * Tadiran Appliances * Tadiran Electronic Systems * Tadiran Spectralink * Tadiran Communications * Tadiran LifeCare * Tadiran Telematics These brands are business are described below.

The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Saft Groupe S.A. of France, which was created in January 2004 when the Doughty Hanson Funds bought the batteries business of Alcatel (who originally purchased Tadiran Batteries in 2000). Tadiran Air Conditioners, Tadiran Appliances (owned by Tadiran Holdings) Tadiran Appliances (also known as Tadiran Air Conditioners), was acquired by the Carrier Corporation, the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer and distributor of heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, itself a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) of the USA and a constitute of Dow Jones Industrial Average. Carrier initially acquired 26%of the company in 1997 and took full ownership of it in 2004.Carrier Corp acquires remaining interest in Tadiran Appliances Ltd In October 2009, Carrier sold Tadiran Appliances to Crystal Consumer Products, a white goods distributor in Israel, which shortly afterwards changed its name to Tadiran Holdings (). In the past, Tadiran Appliances used to manufacture a wide range of White goods, including: refrigerators and freezers; stoves and ovens; TV sets ( assembly of Italy's Voxon models) and Radio sets and Car Radios. However, today only the Air conditioning business remains active (and still has the highest market share by far in Israel). Tadiran Telecommunications (merged with ECI Telecom) * Tadiran Telecommunications - was a manufacturer of networking infrastructure solutions for carrier and service providers listed on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: TTELF). In September 1998 Tadiran Telecommunications merged with ECI Telecom Ltd. In July 2007 ECI Telecom was acquired by a private equity group and, after 25 years, has been delisted from Nasdaq.

In 1995 Tadiran decided to sell the Ituran concept to a group of investors for $250,000 USD. In 1998 the company had an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, raising the capital required to develop the service overseas in the United States, Brazil and Argentina.'Vehicle Protection Highly Profitable in Israel: Excellent Financial Report for Ituran' Globes, May 1998 In November 1999, Ituran acquired Tadiran Telematics, which continued to manufacture the vehicle tracking systems Ituran was using for its services, for $10 million. The acquisition enabled Ituran to reduce the cost of the systems it sold. Ituran changed the company's name to Telematics Wireless. In 2004, Telematics Wireless won contracts to install and deploy vehicle tracking systems in Korea and China, for local companies developing a service similar to Ituran's.

It appears that on the day in question he called at the house of Mr Eli Benjafield, Marshmoor farm, where he took dinner, leaving there about three o'clock, with two of Mr. Benjafield's sons (boys), for the purpose of bathing in the river Stour. He separated from the young Benjafields a few yards, undressed himself, and plunged into the water, and almost immediately afterwards he was seen struggling in the river. The boys were frightened, and called a to a man named Robert Turke, who was working within thirty yards of the spot, but he only reached the river in time to see the poor unfortunate man sink; and the water being very deep, the body was not got out for more than an hour afterwards.

The purpose of DFC was to serve as an \\"investment banking service\\" that would \\"assist Australia‚Äôs industrial development by providing long-term finance and permanent capital to Australian companies.\\" The abbreviation ‚ÄúDelFin‚Äù was used in the names of some of DFC‚Äôs subsidiary companies.

It is the fourth and last novel in the Rigante series. Plot In northern part of the land lies the Moidart and the city of Eldacre; further north is the location of the Rigante clans. This is the place that the highlanders have settled remain free. The Moidart's son, Gaise Macon (known by the Rigante soul name of 'Stormrider') is in the Royalist king's army, and serves loyally. An old prophecy is making him a hunted man by Lord Winterbourne, the leader of the Redeemer Knights, a group of killers. When they were sacking the village of Shelsans, a monk showed him the skull of Cernunnos. A priest prophesied before he was executed that Winterbourne would be killed by the man with the golden eye - who Winterbourne assumes is Macon. Winterbourne kills the king, takes control of the army, attempts several assassinations on Macon and launches an invasion on the town the Stormrider is deployed at. Macon holds out due to a warning from a traitor of Winterbourne's army, but the woman he loved was killed. The Moidart's castle at Eldacre is invaded by soldiers of the Pinance who are allied to Winterbourne, and is a longtime rival/ enemy of the Moidart. The Moidart hides in the castle with a few loyal men, kills the Pinancer leaders, and takes control of the Pinance's army. Macon leads the Eldacre Company back to Eldacre, and the Moidart seeks the Rigante's assistance in the coming invasion by Winterbourne. Cernunnos' spirit forces Winterbourne to hand his skull to the Rigante witch-woman, the Dweller, who passes it on to Stormrider. As Winterbourne's forces close in on Eldacre, a mage in the Moidart's service communicates with Winterbourne, informing him that the skull of Cernunnos is in his possession. Winterbourne moves around the battlefield and comes to Eldacre with a detachment of elite troops. However the loss of the skull has reduced the fighting skills of the Redeemers from their previous levels to a point where they are defeated by the injured Rigante. Winterbourne is stopped as he tries to escape with the skull and discovers that the man with the golden eye was not Macon. Macon uses the skull, and Cernunnos takes control of him, temporarily giving him god-like powers. He heals and revives both armies. As Cernunnos prepares to destroy mankind, he is stopped by Macon's old friend, Mulgrave, who shoots a golden bullet into his heart. The Moidart is made the new king. Behind the scenes It is generally theorized that the early entries in the Rigante series are Gemmell's interpretation of the wars fought by the native Britons against the invading Romans, a point supported by the single landmass and the mountainous northern regions portrayed in the book. The armies of Stone are clearly based on the Roman Legions, even down to the descriptions of their armaments and military formations. Additionally, the Sea Wolves which frequently raid the Keltoi settlements are clearly based on Saxon, Angle, Jute and Viking raiders. The later books in the Rigante series can be seen as broad parallels to the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the sixteenth century and the English Civil War of the seventeenth century. Since Gemmell never put the point to rest, it can be left to the reader's opinion as to what Gemmel was writing a fantasy counterpart of. The Morrigu is a character carried over from the novels Sword In The Storm and Midnight Falcon. She is depicted as an evil woman who grants men wishes, only to destroy them later. However, in Ravenheart and Stormrider, it is revealed that she is actually someone who loves all life and wants to help the human race.

JBNHS Vol. 102(2) Geographical distribution The long-tailed goral (also known as the Chinese gray goral) was and is sparsely found in the wild throughout China, Russia, and Korea, as well as the Himalayas.Crane, M., J. Willard and J. Grant. 2009. \\"Naemorhedus caudatus\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed November 27, 2011 The main population in the wild today is found in Russia where there is a population of about 600 which is in decline; in other places the populations are below 200. Many of these animals are kept in zoos throughout the world. (e.g., The Wilds of Ohio, Saint Louis Zoo, Woodlands Park Zoo, Seattle WA, Los Angeles Zoo, Minnesota Zoo) Indian Zoo In 1982, 18 gorals died in captivity in the Indian Zoo. Their deaths were caused by taeniasis parasitic disease, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis. Habitat The long-tailed goral prefers high elevations with rocky, dry, steep, cliff-ridden mountains.Duckworth, J.W., MacKinnon, J. & Tsytsulina, K. 2008. Naemorhedus caudatus. In: IUCN 2011. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2011.2. www.iucnredlist.org. They make their homes near sparsely vegetated cliffs with small crevices where they can hide from danger. These areas are sometimes covered by evergreen and deciduous forests, and gorals are occasionally found feeding on exposed grassy ridges. Group size The goral is a group-oriented species and lives in herds with two to 12 individuals.Nowak, Ronald M., ed. 1991. Walker's Mammals of the World. 5th Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London. 1,629p. The groups consist of females, kids, and younger males; older males tend to be solitary. Group range The animals tend to stay within a 100-acre range; this can be different for males in rut. Males in rut will travel long distances over rough terrain to find as many females to fertilize as possible. Description The long-tailed goral appears very similar to goats. Males can weigh 62-93 lbs and females 49-77 lbs. Lengths can vary anywhere from 32 to 51 inches and shoulder height 20-31 inches.\\"Thai Wildlife : Rare or Extinct : Goral (Chinese Goral).\\" Thai Society for the Conservation of Wild Animals. The Society for the Convservation of Wild Animals, 28 Sept. 2001. Web. 27 Nov. 2011. http://www.tscwa.org/wildlife/rare_or_extinct_09.html They are even-toed ungulates of the goat-antelope family. The tips of their horns curve back and have distinct rings. There are openings between their hooves. The face of a goral is flat like that of a serow, and the nose and eyes are very close together. It has brown fur with shades of gray; the outer fur is long. The bushy tail is usually dark brown or black in color. Females usually are lighter in shade than that of males; their horns are smaller than males' horns. Diet Gorals are considered to be browsers because they eat a wide variety of grasses, woody material, and nuts and fruits. In the summer months, they tend to feed on the many grasses that grow on the mountains. Throughout the winter, they browse on woody twigs and leaves of trees and shrubs; they have been known to eat nuts, such as acorns, and a few fruits. Life span The goral's average lifespan in the wild is 10‚Äì15 years, although a captive goral was aged at 17 years.\\" The females will go into a 30- to 40-hour estrus cycle once per year, when they can be fertilized by a male.\\"Thai Wildlife : Rare or Extinct : Goral (Chinese Goral).\\" Thai Society for the Conservation of Wild Animals.

At the end of a 215-day gestation period, they give birth to one offspring, or very rarely twins.\\" Breeding within the zoo systems has been successful, with the San Diego Zoo especially so.Patton, Marilyn L., Lance Aubrey, Mark Edwards, Randy Rieches, Jeff Zuba, and Valentine A. Lance. \\"Successful Contraception in a Herd of Chinese Goral (Nemorhaedus Goral Arnouxianus) with Melengestrol Acetate.\\" Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine 31.2 (2000): 228-30. American Association of Zoo Veterinarians. Web. 11 July 2011. Conservation The long-tailed goral is protected under Appendix I of CITES, and numerous reserves have been set aside, but they are not the main focus of the reserves; however, they are protected when they are on these properties.Duckworth, J.W., MacKinnon, J. & Tsytsulina, K. 2008. Naemorhedus caudatus. In: IUCN 2011. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2011.2. www.iucnredlist.org. In China, the long- tailed goral is a Class II species, meaning it is protected. It is poorly enforced because of the animals' uses in traditional medicine. The only conservation effort is bringing these animals into captivity within the zoo system, which should prevent it from going extinct. Poaching of wild gorals is increasing; they are poached for their fur, meat, and horns. They are also poached because some of their parts are used in traditional medicine. Their natural predators are also affecting the population. Their predators include lynx, snow leopards, tigers, and wolves in some regions. The agriculture business has not been kind to the goral; their habitat is being destroyed rapidly by the slash-and-burn technique -- their natural habitats are being farmed and used for livestock. The domestic livestock are grazing off all the grasses, leaving nothing for the native goral to eat. They are losing space in zoos, because they are not a very well known animal. The gorals are being replaced with more popular animals, such as tigers, lions, and bears; this is strictly an economic issue, because better known animals at the zoo attract more guests which therefore increases profits. Eliminating poaching will be difficult, since the most common reason is sustenance hunting. Increasing ecotourism would bring money to the poachers, so they would not have to further exploit the goral population. Captive populations in zoos are healthy, so reintroduction of this species is possible. The goral has been on the endangered species list for some time, but the species' conservation status has not changed. As long as the population continues to decline, the long- tailed goral's outlook is not a healthy one.

It grew out of the original F√ºhrer-Begleit-Battalion formed in 1939 to escort and protect Adolf Hitler at the front. It was formed in November 1944 and destroyed in April 1945. The F√ºhrer-Begleit-Battalion (FBB), 1939‚Äì1940 Before the 1 September 1939 attack on Poland, Adolf Hitler's personal military bodyguard came from two distinct, independent units based in Berlin: the Chancellery Guards, originally assigned by the army, and then the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (SS bodyguard regiment Adolf Hitler; LSSAH), which replaced the Chancellery Guards.Cook, Stan & Bender, R. James. Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, R. James Bender Publishing, 1994, pp. 9, 17, 19. When hostilities started, Hitler ordered the LSSAH to participate in the campaign against Poland, leaving him with no large military type of bodyguard formation (a small contingent of the Leibstandarte, remained stationed in Berlin). By that time, an army infantry instructor, Erwin Rommel, came to Hitler's attention. Rommel was promoted to Generalmajor on 23 August 1939 and Hitler saw to it that Rommel was appointed in charge of a new battalion being organized to function as his personal escort to the front.Butler, Daniel Allen. Field Marshal: The Life and Death of Erwin Rommel, Casemate, 2015, pp. 142, 144. This led to the formation of the FBB in 1939. It had the task of protecting Hitler's military headquarters and accompanying him when visiting battlefronts. It also was responsible for all luggage that travelled with Hitler and his staff.Hoffmann, Peter. Hitler's Personal Security: Protecting the F√ºhrer 1921‚Äì1945, Da Capo Press, 2009, p. 59.Felton, Mark. Guarding Hitler: The Secret World of the F√ºhrer, Pen & Sword, 2014, p. 41. Prior to the invasion of France and the Low Countries, Rommel left the FBB to take command of the army's 7th Panzer Division.Butler, Daniel Allen. Field Marshal: The Life and Death of Erwin Rommel, Casemate, 2015, p. 151. The F√ºhrerbegleitabteilung, Panzergrenadierdivision \\"Gro√üdeutschland\\" With the expansion of the elite Gro√üdeutschland Infantry Regiment into a division on 3 March 1942, the number of subunits under its control was expanded. Among these subunits was a new F√ºhrerbegleit-unit, as well as another unit with F√ºhrer in its name, the F√ºhrergrenadierabteilung.. Although the new F√ºhrerbegleit-unit had practically the same purpose as the original and still-existing F√ºhrerbegleitbattalion, and was approximately the same size, it was different from the FBB in that it was motorized. The newer unit was further distinguished by nomenclature: it was known as the F√ºhrerbegleitabteilung (FBA: F√ºhrer escort detachment). This is because battalion-sized Wehrmacht (and even Waffen-SS) ground units were designated according to class, with Abteilung for motorized, mechanized, armoured, or self-propelled battalion- sized units controlled by a battalion headquarters, and Battalion for infantry units. As a result of its transfer to the Gro√üdeutschland (GD) division, the detachment‚Äîby now incorporating a heavy battery from Flak-Regiment \\"Hermann G√∂ring\\", First Paratroop Panzer Division Hermann G√∂ring‚Äîwas moved to the eastern front, with headquarters in Hitler's Wolfschanze. Parts of the GD were used to expand the FBA until it eventually served as GD's replacement and reserve battalion. The FBA saw action along with the rest of Gro√üdeutschland Panzer-Grenadier-Division in its campaigns on the eastern front. Although not permanently attached to the division and composed mainly of an ad hoc collections of several units, the FBA and its successors would retain the traditional helmet insignia of its parent division, and when sub-units of the Gro√üdeutschland division were being expanded to bring GD to corps strength (Panzerkorps Gro√üdeutschland), the FBA was enhanced to brigade strength as well. While the FBA was being refitted for service on the eastern front, Hitler ordered it to head west in 1944, along with most of its vehicles and personnel, to prepare for the Ardennes counter-offensive, for which it would be expanded into a brigade. F√ºhrerbegleitbrigade Otto Ernst Remer in 1945 Radically upgraded for the Ardennes Offensive (\\"Operation Wacht am Rhein\\") to provide General der Panzertruppe Hasso von Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army with additional firepower, the F√ºhrerbegleitbrigade was formed from elements of the FBA, Panzerkorps Gro√üdeutschland, Hitler's personal army guard detail, and the mobile artillery from Hitler's Wolfschanze headquarters. This unit was placed under the command of Oberst (colonel) Otto Remer as a reward for his successfully foiling of a critical part of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt of Hitler and attempted military coup against the Nazi leadership in Berlin.Kershaw, Ian. Hitler: A Biography, W. W. Norton & Company, 2008. pp. 837‚Äì839. The new FBB was essentially a restructured tank brigade, with units created from whatever excess personnel were available. Its combat strength included long-barrelled Panzer IVs and the turretless assault guns of the Sturmgesch√ºtz-Abteilung 200, two organic Panzergrenadier (mechanized infantry) battalions, the 928th Bicyclist Battalion, and a self-propelled artillery battalion with 105-millimeter Wespe and 150-millimeter Hummel artillery pieces. Committed to the front on 18 December 1944 as part of Fifth Panzer Army's XLVII. Panzerkorps, the FBB saw action against the US Army 101st Airborne Division at Bastogne. On 26 January 1945 the FBB was ordered to expand and form the F√ºhrerbegleitdivision. F√ºhrerbegleitdivision When the Gro√üdeutschland Division was expanded to Panzer Corps Gro√üdeutschland, its subordinate units were expanded to bring GD to corps status. As part of this drastic reorganization, the FBB was detached from army control, expanded by incorporating elements of the FGB and Panzergrenadier-Division Gro√üdeutschland, and redesignated the F√ºhrer-Begleit-Division (FBD); at the same time, its sister formation, the F√ºhrergrenadierbrigade, was also upgraded to divisional status and renamed the F√ºhrer-Grenadier-Division (FGD). Both \\"F√ºhrer\\" divisions were put in the OKH (Oberkommando der Heere: the army high command), reserve until committed to the eastern front. Commanded by Otto Remer, now a major general, the FBD and FGD served in local counterattacks and later assumed fire-brigade roles for attempts to prevent major Soviet breakthroughs. The FBD and FGD were sent to the eastern front to help defend the Vistula front against massing Red Army forces during the Upper Silesian Offensive.Gunter, Georg.

His sentimental paintings of poor people enjoying nature became a posthumous high fashion, notably in the 1870s when his market price rose higher than Constable (Cromer Sands, ¬£3780, 1872) and stayed so until 1894. Turner, his model, far exceeded him in value (The Grand Canal, Venice, sold to Vanderbilt in 1885 for ¬£20,000).Gerald Reitlinger, The Economics of Taste, London 1959, I.82, 277, 470) Life and work Rustic Civility (1833) Children on a mountain top Barmouth Sands by William Collins, 1835, Guildhall Gallery, London Collins was born in Great Titchfield Street, London, son of William Collins Sr., an Irish-born picture- dealer and writer.His father, a native of Wicklow, Ireland, wrote a biography of George Morland, a poem on the slave trade, and other work. He showed a great aptitude for art from an early age, and was, for a while, an informal pupil of George Morland.Collins biog (www.wilkie-collins.info) In 1807, he entered the schools of the Royal Academy (at the same time as William Etty), and exhibited at the Academy for the first time in the same year. In 1809 he was awarded a medal in the life school, and exhibited three pictures - Boy at Breakfast, Boys with a Bird's-nest and a Portrait of Master Lee as he spoke the Prologue at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1811, Collins sold a picture entitled The Young Fifer, to the Marquis of Stafford for 80 guineas, and the next year produced the work which made him famous, The Sale of the Pet Lamb, which was sold for 140 forty guineas and engraved by S. W. Reynolds. He now became the chief support of his family - following the death of his father (in financial difficulty) in that year - and found some valuable patrons, especially Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote, Sir John Leicester, Sir Robert Peel, Sir George Beaumont, and Lord Liverpool. In 1814 two pictures, The Blackberry Gatherers and The Birdcatchers (both sold privately), won him an associateship of the Royal Academy (ARA). In 1815, Collins undertook a sketching tour of the coast near Cromer, and produced a Scene on the Coast of Norfolk which was acquired by the Prince Regent. In 1817 he visited Paris with Leslie and Washington Allston, and painted The Departure of the Diligence from Rouen, and the Scene on the Boulevards (both sold privately) - these were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818. He also painted several portraits around this time. In 1820, Collins was elected a Royal Academician (RA), presenting as his diploma picture The Young Anglers. In 1822 he married Harriet Geddes, sister of the portrait painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter. He continued to exhibit and travel in England and Scotland, and his art enjoyed great popularity. In 1826 he painted The Fisherman's Departure, (engraved by Phelps), and in 1828 made a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, living for short time in Boulogne in 1836. Rustic Hospitality was painted in 1834, and, in 1836, Sunday Morning and As Happy as a King, the subject of the latter picture having been suggested to Collins by the story of a country boy whose ideal of regal happiness was swinging upon a gate all day long and eating fat bacon. Scene from the Caves of Ulysses, at Sorrento (1841) In September 1836, Collins left London for Italy, where he remained until 1838. During these two years he occupied himself unremittingly in advancing his knowledge of painting, but had to return due to illness. He then began a series of pictures depicting Italian life including Poor Travellers at the door of a Capuchin Convent near Vico, Bay of Naples See and A Scene near Subiaco, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. These were followed in 1840‚Äì1841 by two subjects taken from the New Testament - Our Saviour with the Doctors in the Temple, and The Two Disciples at Emmaus. From 1840 to 1842 Collins was librarian to the Royal Academy and in 1843 he moved to a large house at 1 Devonport Street, Hyde Park Gardens. In 1840 he visited Germany, and in 1842 the Shetland Islands - the latter journey inspiring him to produce a series of illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's novel Pirate, which were published in the \\"Waverley\\" edition of the book. In 1846 Collins' Early Morning was exhibited. Ruskin said of it \\"I have never seen the oppression of sunlight in a clear, lurid, rainy atmosphere more perfectly or faithfully rendered, and the various portions of reflected and scattered light are all studied with equal truth and solemn feeling.\\" Collins also produced some watercolours, such as The Rat-catcher, Landing Fish, A Street in Naples and Kentish Peasant Girls, and made several etchings, most of which, along with engravings of his best work, were given to the British Museum by Mrs. Collins. Death The grave of William Collins, St Marys Gardens, Paddington Collins died from heart disease, \\"terminating in dropsy\\", in Devonport Street, on 17 February 1847, and was buried in the cemetery of the church of St. Mary, Paddington, where a handsome monument, in the form of a cross, was erected to his memory by his widow. The grave now stands isolated, on the north side of St Marys Gardens, following the churchyard's conversion to a public park in 1881. The grave has been vandalised and the marble cross is missing; the inscription is also eroding. He left two sons: The elder, William Wilkie Collins, the novelist named after his godfather, the artist David Wilkie, wrote a biography of his father entitled \\"Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R.A.\\" (1848). The younger son, Charles Allston Collins, was also a painter. Works Collins exhibited at the Royal Academy every year from 1807-46 (a total of 124 pictures), and showed 45 pictures at the British Institution. His major works are listed in Volume 2 (pp. 341‚Äì52) of \\"Memoirs\\" (see bibliography). Today his works are included in the collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate Britain in London and other regional centres. Notes Bibliography Collins, Wilkie.

He has represented Northern Ireland at youth level, through a now closed loophole in the Home Nations agreement, and Guernsey at senior level. Career Tardif began his career in Guernsey with Vale Recreation F.C. before joining Portsmouth, turning professional in the 1998 close season. He joined Havant & Waterlooville on loan in August 1999, playing in the first eight league games of Havants' first season in the Southern League Premier Division. He also had a spell on loan with Newport (Isle of Wight) from March to May 2000 and finally made his Portsmouth debut in their 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Tranmere in the FA Cup on 6 January 2001. He made four further appearances for Portsmouth that season, all in the Championship as Portsmouth successfully avoided relegation. His only other appearance for Portsmouth came on 27 August 2001 when Tardif played in their 4‚Äì1 win at home to Grimsby Town. He spent the 2002‚Äì03 season on loan with Bournemouth, playing 14 games in all competitions and, after a spell on loan with Newport (Isle of Wight), in October 2003 joined Havant & Waterlooville on a month's loan, as cover for the injured Gareth Howells. Released by Portsmouth, he joined Oxford United in May 2004, on a two-year contract. He was a regular the following season. However, he found first-team football hard to come by in later seasons, particularly under Jim Smith when Billy Turley kept him out of the side to the extent that he had a transfer request accepted by Oxford in December 2006. In September 2007, he retired from professional football to start a new career, although planned to continue playing semi-professionally. Tardif played one game as a triallist for Eastleigh in October 2007, and joined Basingstoke Town in December 2007, moving to Maidenhead United in March 2008. He was an integral part of the Maidenhead side that narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the season, Tardif keeping four sheets in the final five games. He became a father shortly after the end of the season and chose to reduce the time spent travelling from his Portsmouth home by joining Farnborough in May 2008. He joined Bognor Regis Town in September 2008. He returned to Maidenhead United in the summer of 2009. On 2 June 2010, Tardif rejoined Basingstoke Town. On 26 August 2010, Tardif had his Basingstoke Town contract terminated by mutual consent and returned to his home island, signing with St. Martins A.C. Joining Guernsey F.C. when it was formed in 2011, Chris became Captain in 2016 following the resignation of Sam Cochrane, however in October 2016 Tardif suffering a double leg break at the home match against Godalming Town F.C. which will see him out of the team, probably for the rest of the season. International career A loophole in the FIFA statutes, which has now been closed, allowed footballers who were British citizens, but born outside the UK, to play for any home nation, regardless of whether or not they have any previous connection to it. As none of the Channel Islands are affiliated to FIFA, and Tardif was born in Guernsey, he was therefore eligible to play for any home nation, and represented Northern Ireland at U19 level. He was called into the U21 squad in September 2001, for a European Championship qualifier against Malta, but did not play.NIFG: Chris Tardif Since returning to Guernsey, Tardif has represented Guernsey, in the 2011 Muratti Vase Final, losing on penalties to Jersey, at the 2011 Island Games and then won the 2012 Muratti Vase Final after Guernsey beat Jersey by two goals to nil Also, in 2011 Tardiff joined the newly formed Guernsey F.C. as their goalkeeper. In 2012, he played one match as a forward for Media United in the Guernsey FA Cup to ensure his eligibility for the Muratti.

Biography Rostislav Petrovich Ustinov was born to naval officer Peter Ustinov and Lydia Andreevna (n√©e Stopchanskaya), daughter of the General of Police in the Caucasus. In 1920, during the Civil War in Russia, Rostislav Ustinov moved with his family to Crimea. There he enlisted into a cadet corps military school established by General Pyotr Wrangel. At the end of the year the corps, numbering 650 cadets, moved to Istanbul, and thence to Yugoslavia. In 1923, his mother recalled him to Istanbul, after which she moved to Paris and placed him in the French college of Saint Louis in the city of Le –ú–∞ns. After completing his studies, Rostislav lived with mother in Cannes. In 1934, he was called to serve in the army and was enlisted in the Ninth Cuirassier (cavalry) Regiment. Having served up to the grade of foreman, he refused to continue military career as an officer, deciding to leave the world and to enter a monastery. Four years later, he arrived in the Monastery of Saint Job in Ladomirova in the Carpathian mountains (at the time, the territory of Czechoslovakia). In 1939, Rostislav Ustinov was professed a monk with the name of Vitaly, and received the Little Schema a year later. The Second World War forced the monastic brotherhood to leave Ladomirova and to evacuate to Germany. Vitaly appeared in Berlin where, together with archimandrite Nafanail (L'vov), he engaged in wide missionary activity amongst the Russian refugees and prisoners of war. Nafanail and Vitaly then relocated to Hamburg where they concentrated on the work of preventing thousands of refugees from being compulsorily repatriated to the USSR. In Hamburg, hegumen Vitaly began active church life at Camp Fischbeck. In the barrack-type church, the daily circle of divine services were conducted. Simultaneously, Vitaly began a small monastic brotherhood, and established a printing house which began to print badly needed anthologies from the church service-books for all the camp churches of Germany. From 1947 to 1951, Vitaly was Prior of the London parish, where archimandrite Anthony (Bloom) serially served in one church. However, not recognizing the \\"soviet\\" bishop as a true servant of God, bishop Vitaly called Anthony \\"the servant of satan\\". Life as bishop On 12 July 1951, on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, Vitaly was consecrated Bishop of Sao Paulo, vicar of the Brazilian diocese. There the young bishop opened a printing house and arranged a small shelter for boys who were trained as acolytes for the cycle of divine services. In 1955, Bishop Vitaly with his brotherhood was transferred to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 75 miles from the city, he erected the Dormition monastery. He was appointed ruling bishop of Montreal and Canada, Bishop Vitaly founded a skete in Mansonville, Quebec. In Montreal, Bishop Vitaly built and magnificently equipped a large cathedral. The fine house of his(its) monastic farmstead and a residence is near to a cathedral. In this farmstead, a printing house operated, publishing service-books and the periodical \\"The Orthodox Bulletin\\". The death of Metropolitan Philaret in 1985 necessitated the election of a new Metropolitan. On 22 January 1986, Vitaly was elected Metropolitan of Eastern America and New York, also retaining management of the Canadian diocese. Citing his declining health in 2001 Metropolitan Vitaly announced that he was going to retire the same year. During the council of Bishops of 2001, Metropolitan Vitaly announced his resignation. Immediately afterwards, he left to his residence at the Holy Transfiguration monastery in Mansonville, accompanied by his supporters. After the election of the New First Hierarch of ROCOR, Metropolitan Laurus, Metropolitan Vitaly released an epistle denouncing the latest ROCOR Synod, asserting that he continued to be ROCOR's primate. A number of ROCOR clergy and parishioners who were against ROCOR's union with the Moscow Patriarchate formed a new church administration around Metropolitan Vitaly, renaming themselves as the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile (referred to as ROCOR-Vitaly in common parlance). The episcopate of ROCOR asserted that Metropolitan Vitaly was being held hostage by schismatics who took advantage of his failing health and used his name to produce a schism. The episcopate made numerous attempts at contacting Metropolitan Vitaly, but were unable to get through to him personally. Metropolitan Vitaly reposed on 25 September 2006. He was buried in his Mansonville skete by the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile. ROCOR bishops were not permitted to be present, consequently they served his funeral separately.

The screenplay by Gerald Ayres is based on the 1940 play Old Acquaintance by John Van Druten, which was previously adapted in 1943 by Vincent Sherman under its original title starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. The film was released to commercial failure and mixed critical response. Plot Two women find their friendship is tested when one rises from obscurity to success while the other stagnates in a stalled career. Liz Hamilton, a young woman with literary ambitions, and Merry Noel Blake, an all- American blonde beauty from Atlanta, are close friends who met while they were freshmen at Smith College in the 1950s. Soon after graduation, Liz writes a critically acclaimed book and drifts into unfulfilling relationships and one- night stands, including an empty encounter in an airplane lavatory, a fling with a teenaged hustler and an affair with Chris Adams, a young reporter for Rolling Stone. Meanwhile, Merry fulfills her aspiration to a life of domesticity caring for a husband and child by marrying Doug Blake and moving to a beach house in Malibu. Although Merry is happy, she can't help but envy Liz for her glamorous career as an author. Merry decides to write a book of her own and, with Liz's assistance, A House by the Sea, a trashy roman √† clef about the Malibu colony, finds a publisher and becomes a huge best-seller. Before long Merry is a darling of the media and her fame and fortune surpass those of Liz (who is experiencing a severe case of writer's block), leading to jealousy between the old friends and problems in Merry's marriage. The film takes place over the course of 22 years, first depicting Merry's and Doug's elopement in 1959, and then picking up during three segments, taking place in 1969, 1975 and 1981, showing changes in the characters' relationships (and society) over the course of two decades.

Mulligan was forced to withdraw when previous commitments conflicted with the new schedule. The film proved to be the last directed by Cukor. It also marked the screen debuts of an 8-year-old Nicole Eggert and also Meg Ryan, who played Merry's daughter in the 1969 and 1981 segments, respectively. Filming New York City locations seen in the film include the Algonquin Hotel and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Additional locations include Madison, New Jersey (standing in for Northampton, Massachusetts), Los Angeles, and Malibu. Interiors were filmed at the Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Sets were later rented for use in the Biltmore Hotel scenes in the 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters. Music The soundtrack includes \\"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\\" performed by Bessie Smith and \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" sung by Willie Nelson. Critical reception The film received generally mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote \\"The movie can't make up its mind whether it's about a tumultuously difficult but rewarding friendship or whether it's a sendup of the contemporary literary scene. It fails as both...The culprit is Gerald Ayres...[who] has spread his talents very thin...Though he has written two big roles, he doesn't seem capable of writing either a romantic drama, like The Turning Point, or an informed satire...Mr. Ayres can occasionally write good wisecracks...But he has no particular insight into the publishing scene. Nor does he ever convince us of the enduring strength of the friendship that lasts through thick and, more often, thin. Though Misses Bisset and Bergen are appealing actresses, Rich and Famous doesn't hold together.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed \\"This film is a real curiosity. It's a good-bad movie, like The Other Side of Midnight or The Greek Tycoon. It contains scenes that make you want to squirm because of their awkwardness and awfulness, and yet you don't want to look away and you're not bored. The movie has the courage to go to extremes, and some of those extremes may not be art but are certainly unforgettable...It's a slick, trashy, entertaining melodrama, with too many dumb scenes to qualify as successful.\\" Variety wrote \\"While not without its problems, Rich and Famous is an absorbing drama of some notable qualities, the greatest of which is a gutsy, fascinating and largely magnificent performance by Jacqueline Bisset...For a bright, sophisticated piece such as this, particularly one under the guidance of the irrepressibly elegant George Cukor, the somewhat harsh, murky visual style is surprising.\\" TV Guide rated the film one out of four stars and commented, \\"This could have been ‚Äì and is ‚Äì a very funny film; unfortunately, most of the laughs are unintentional...Although his version of Van Druten's play Old Acquaintance is sexier than the original 1943 screen treatment...it also fails to satisfy on many levels...This glossy soap opera suffers from Cukor's failure to control his actors. Moreover, the costumes are atrocious. The film simply lacks the sophisticated style that made Cukor famous.\\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated \\"Rich and Famous isn't camp, exactly: It's more like a homosexual fantasy. Jacqueline Bisset's affairs, with their masochistic overtones, are creepy, because they don't seem like what a woman would get into. And Candice Bergen is used almost as if she were a big, goosey, female impersonator.\\" Time Out London wrote \\"Considering neither Bisset nor Bergen had ever shown the slightest acting ability before in movies, their performances in the Bette Davis/Miriam Hopkins roles in this loose reworking of Old Acquaintance are very capable...Of course much of the credit must go to Cukor, the veteran 'woman's director'; but the film disappoints in its unconfident handling of the secondary characters.\\" Awards and nominations Gerald Ayres won the Writers Guild Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.

History The church was added to the gateway of the already-existing Benedictine Abbey of Saint Mary around the year 1170, although the oldest remaining piece is reportedly from 1180. While the monks used the abbey church, St Nicolas's was built for their lay servants and tenants. The Normans propagated the cult of Saint Nicholas and many English churches are named after him. The earliest documentary evidence of this church's existence is in a ruling about tithes in 1177 by Pope Alexander III. Saint Edmund of Abingdon worshipped there as a child and his mother was initially buried there. From its early years, there is evidence that a school used a room in St Nicolas which has links with the founding of Abingdon School. A tower was added and the chancel rebuilt in the 15th century. Parish The church became a parish church in 1372, when the parish of St Nicholas was carved out of the parish of St Helen's. The new parish consisted of scattered pieces of land at Fitzharris, Northcourt and Bayworth, which were granges of the Abbey, as well as a mill on the River Ock and the precincts of the Abbey itself. The purpose of the new parish was to provide an income to the Abbey, after the devastation caused by the Black Death and the sacking of the Abbey in 1327. The two parishes were reunited in 1989 to form the single ecclesiastical parish of Abingdon.St. Nicolas's Church, Abingdon For civil purposes the parish joined Abingdon St Helen's to form the civil parish of Abingdon in 1894.Vision of Britain website.

The two operations were conducted between May and December 1972. Operation Enhance In late March 1972, communist North Vietnam launched what is called by the United States the Easter Offensive against South Vietnam. The communist objective was to weaken the South Vietnamese armed forces, capture additional South Vietnamese territory, and weaken American resolve to continue to assist South Vietnam. The Eastern Offensive was carried out in the context that North Vietnam was negotiating a peace agreement with the United States and wished to strengthen its position in South Vietnam prior to completing the agreement.Andrade, Dale (1995), Trial by Fire, New York: Hippocrene Books, p. 43 The Easter Offensive put the military forces of South Vietnam under intense pressure. After the fall of the provincial capital of Quang Tri and the capability of the South Vietnamese to stave off North Vietnam in doubt, U.S. President Richard Nixon on 17 May directed that a maximum of U.S. equipment and material be given to South Vietnam as quickly as possible. On 19 May, Nixon approved a list of equipment to be provided to South Vietnam by 1 August and Project Enhance began. Nixon also wanted to build up South Vietnamese military equipment so that, if the anticipated peace agreement declared a moratorium on introducing new military equipment, South Vietnam would have adequate supplies.Webb, William J. and Poole, Walter S. (2007), The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the War in Vietnam 1971-1973, Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pp 213-215 Operation Enhance provided South Vietnamese armed forces with artillery and anti-tank weapons, 69 helicopters, 55 jet fighters, 100 other aircraft, and 7 patrol boats.Isaacs, Arnold R. (1983), Without Honor: Defeat in Vietnam and Cambodia, Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 511 The equipment provided to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) included 2 air defense artillery battalions, 3 175mm artillery battalions, 2 M48A3 tank battalions and 141 TOW missile launchers. Operation Enhance Plus On 20 October 1972 President Nixon ordered additional U.S. military equipment to be delivered to South Vietnam. Nixon anticipated that a peace agreement would be concluded shortly and that the agreement would ban an expansion of military aid to South Vietnam and permit only a one-for-one replacement of military equipment. He wanted the South Vietnamese to have a maximum of equipment on hand before the restrictions in the peace agreement took place. The last shipment of equipment arrived on 12 December and the peace agreement was not concluded until 27 January 1973.Hartsook, Elizabeth and Slade, Stuart (2013), Air War Vietnam Plans and Operations 1969-1975, Newtown, CT: Defense Lions Publications, p. 325; Webb and Poole, pp. 220-222 The equipment transfers to South Vietnam were enormous consisting of 234 F-5A and A-37 jet fighter planes, 32 C-130 transport planes, 277 UH-1H helicopters, 72 tanks, 117 armored personnel carriers, artillery and 1,726 trucks. The cost of the equipment was about $750 million 9 ($5.7 billion in 2015 dollars). Moreover, most of the U.S. supplied equipment of two departing South Korean divisions (approximately 38,000 men) was also given to South Vietnam. In addition, the U.S. transferred title of its military bases in South Vietnam and all the equipment on the bases to South Vietnam.Isaacs, pp. 48-49, 511 Impact As a result of Operations Enhance and Enhance Plus South Vietnam at the end of 1972 had the fourth largest air force in the world. However, the ability of the South Vietnamese to use all this equipment and to maintain it was much in doubt. An adviser to President Nguyen Van Thieu said that the operations had political value as a sign that the U.S. would not abandon South Vietnam/\\"Lipsman, Samuel and Weiss, Stephen (1984), The False Peace,;; Boston: Boston Publishing Company, p 18; Isaacs, pp. 48-49 The Paris Peace Accords, signed by all parties to the war on 27 January 1973 prohibited replacement of military equipment in South Vietnam except on a one-for-one basis and ended large transfers of military equipment from the United States.

Bennett batted and threw left-handed, stood tall, and weighed . He was the older brother of Dave Bennett, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in one MLB game as Dennis's Phillies teammate. Bennett was born in Oakland, California, raised in the Shasta Valley town of Yreka, near the Oregon border, and attended Yreka High School. He was signed by the Phillies in 1958 after attending Shasta College and played four full seasons in their farm system before being promoted to the Majors from Triple-A in May 1962. He had a strong rookie campaign, appearing in 31 games, including 24 starts, winning nine contests with seven complete games and two shutouts. He struck out 149 hitters in 174 innings pitched and reached double figures in strikeouts in four games. But he was seriously injured in a car accident in January 1963 while playing winter baseball in Puerto Rico, delaying his 1963 debut until June 23. Nevertheless, he again won nine games as the Phillies finished in the first division for the first time since 1955. Bennett, circa 1965 He was the Phillies' opening day starting pitcher in 1964 against the Mets and did not record a decision in a game the Phils eventually won, 5‚Äì3, behind reliever Johnny Klippstein. Bennett took a regular turn in the 1964 Phillies' starting rotation but a lingering shoulder injury, a leftover from his winter 1963 car accident, began to limit his effectiveness in the season's final weeks. In late September, during the Phillies' disastrous ten-game losing streak that knocked them out of first place, Bennett lost his only two starts: September 23 against the Cincinnati Reds and then six days later against the St. Louis Cardinals. In November, he was traded to the Red Sox for slugging first baseman Dick Stuart. A sore arm plagued Bennett during his Red Sox tenure: he made 42 starts in almost years, with the lone highlight a complete game, 4‚Äì0 shutout against the Angels on May 1, 1967‚Äîa game in which Bennett helped his own cause with a three-run home run off Jorge Rubio. He had another complete game win against the Angels on May 30 (a five-hit, 6‚Äì1 triumph), but a little more than three weeks later, he was traded on waivers to the Mets. During his half-season with Boston, he contributed four wins to the 1967 Red Sox, who unexpectedly won the American League pennant on the season's final day. After going 1‚Äì1 with the 1967 Mets, Bennett played at the Triple-A level in the Chicago Cubs' organization before landing with the 1968 Angels, where he went winless in five decisions over the season's final two months. In a seven-season MLB career and in 182 games pitched, Bennett posted a 43‚Äì47 record with 572 strikeouts and a 3.69 ERA in 863 innings pitched, including six shutouts and 28 complete games.http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v;=l&pid;=931&bid;=1364 He played in the minors into 1973 before retiring from the game.

Volunteers came to fight for a variety of reasons including religious or ethnic loyalties, but mostly for the money. In this sense, Bosniaks received support mostly from so-called \\"Islamic countries\\", Serbs from \\"Eastern Orthodox countries\\", and Croats from \\"Catholic countries\\". The presence of foreign fighters is documented, although numbers, activities and significance are often described and presented in manner which range from objective point of view, without cultural or religious prejudices, and/or without ideological and political bias, to subjective and distorted perspectives which depended on affiliations, to outright misrepresentation that in certain cases took form of conspiracy theories. However, none of these groups constituted more than five percent of any of the respective armies' total manpower strength. Bosnian side Volunteer fighters often colloquially called \\"Bosnian mujahideen\\" were primarily from Afghanistan and Arab countries, though Muslim volunteers arrived from all around the world, including Asia, North Africa and Europe. Estimated numbers varied wildly, depending on sources number vary from 500‚Äì4,000. The military effectiveness of the mujahideen is disputed. Although, former U.S. Balkans peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke said in an interview that he believed the Bosnian Muslims wouldn't have survived without foreign help, as at the time a U.N. arms embargo uniquely diminished the Bosnian government's fighting capabilities - he called the arrival of the mujahideen \\"a pact with the devil\\" from which Bosnia still is recovering.LA Times, Bosnia Seen as Hospitable Base and Sanctuary for Terrorists, 8 October 2001 On the other hand, according to general Stjepan ≈†iber, the highest ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian Army, the key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by Tuƒëman and Croatian counter-intelligence with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and the crimes committed by Croat forces. Although the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegoviƒá regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability. Some originally came as humanitarian aid workers, while others were escaping criminal charges in their own home countries, or came to be prosecuted for illegally departing to a foreign country and becoming soldiers.Humanitarian worker turned Mujahideen They arrived to region of Central Bosnia in the second half of 1992. From that point these fighters operated independently, with little to no coordination with the ARBiH, until winter of 1993-94 Initially, the foreign mujahideen gave food and other basic necessities to the local Muslim population, who were deprived of such by the Serb forces. They sometimes attempted to recruit some local young men, though with limited success, offering them military training, uniforms and weapons. As a result, some locals joined in. Although these foreigners made local Bosniak Muslims upset.Spero News , Bosnia: Muslims upset by Wahhabi leaders, Adrian Morgan, 13 November 2006 Those who accepted to join imitated the foreigners in both dress and behavior, to such an extent that it was sometimes, according to the ICTY documentation in subsequent war crimes trials, \\"difficult to distinguish between the two groups\\". For that reason, the ICTY has used the term \\"Mujahideen\\" regardless who joined the unit.ICTY, Summary of the Judgment for Enver Hadzihasanovic and Amir Kubura, 15 March 2006. See section \\"VI. The Mujahedin\\" Once hostilities broke out between the Bosnian government and the Croat forces (HVO), they participated in some confrontations.ICTY: Summary of the judgement for Enver Had≈æihasanoviƒá and Amir Kubura - The first mujahideen training camp was located in Poljanice next to the village of Mehurici, in the Bila valley, Travnik municipality. The mujahideen group established there included mujahideen from Arab countries as well as some locals. The mujahideen from Poljanice camp were also established in the towns of Zenica and Travnik and, from the second half of 1993 onwards, in the village of Orasac, also located in the Bila valley. In order to impose some control and order, the Bosnian government decided to incorporate organized foreign volunteers into the 7th Muslim Brigade known as El Mud≈æahid on 13 August 1993. ICTY found that there was one battalion-sized unit called El Mud≈æahid (El Mujahid). It was established on 13 August 1993, by the Bosnian Army, which decided to form a unit of foreign fighters in order to impose control over them as the number of the foreign volunteers started to increase. The El Mud≈æahid unit was initially attached to and supplied by the regular Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), even though they often operated independently as a special unit. Following the end of the Bosnian War, in a 2005 interview with U.S. journalist Jim Lehrer, Holbrooke stated that \\"There were over 1,000 people in the country who belonged to what we then called Mujahideen freedom fighters. We now know that that was al-Qaida. I'd never heard the word before, but we knew who they were. And if you look at the 9/11 hijackers, several of those hijackers were trained or fought in Bosnia. We cleaned them out, and they had to move much further east into Afghanistan. So if it hadn't been for Dayton, we would have been fighting the terrorists deep in the ravines and caves of Central Bosnia in the heart of Europe.\\"PBS Newshour with Jim Jim Lehrer, A New Constitution for Bosnia, 22 November 2005 Two of the five 9/11 hijackers, childhood friends Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, had been Bosnian mujahideen.9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 5.2, pp. 153‚Äì159 Consequences The foreign mujahideen were required to leave the Balkans under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Agreement, but few stayed. The U.S. State Department and SFOR official from allied military intelligence estimated that no more than 200 foreign-born militants actually stayed and lived in Bosnia in 2001. In September 2007, 50 of these individuals had their citizenship status revoked. Since then 100 more individuals have been prevented from claiming citizenship rights. 250 more were under investigation, while the body which is charged to reconsider the citizenship status of the foreign volunteers in the Bosnian War, including Christian fighters from Russia and Western Europe, states that 1,500 cases will eventually be examined. During the Bosnian war, instances of Mujahideen units perpetrating war crimes, including the killing, torture and beheading of Serbian and Croat civilians and soldiers have been documented. During the trial of Rasim Deliƒá, the judges concluded that the prosecution had proven that more than 50 Serbs captured during the Battle for Vozuƒáa had been killed in the Kamenica camp by the Mujahideen. Though the judges agreed Deliƒá had effective control over the El Mujahideen unit, he was acquitted from its responsibility since ICTY concluded that he didn't possess enough information to stop them. He was also acquitted from the charge of not saving 24 Croat POWs from being executed and injured by the Mujahideen since the prosecution couldn't prove he had already assumed the position of Chief of Staff of the ARBiH to which he was appointed to the same day. The judges concluded that the prosecution had proven that the Mujahideen from July to August 1995 had treated 12 Serbian POWs detained first in the village of Livada and then the Kamenica camp, inhumanely and had killed three of them. Deliƒá was sentenced to three years in prison for not stopping it. An Iraqi mujahideen Abduladhim Maktouf was convicted for abducting Croat civilians of Travnik in 1993. He was ultimately handed a prison term of three years.Bosnia Awards Iraqi War Crimes Convict ‚Ç¨36,600 However no indictment was issued by the ICTY's investigators and prosecutors against them, only two Bosnian Army commanding officers were indicted on the basis of command responsibility. The indictment in the cases of Amir Kubura and Enver Had≈æihasanoviƒá (the two Bosnian Army officers in question) concerning a number of events involving mujahideen, however prosecution eventually drooped all the charges on both Kubura and Had≈æihasanoviƒá, who were ultimately acquitted on all counts related to the incidents involving mujahideen. However, Had≈æihasanoviƒá served two years having been found guilty of having troops under his command had abused prisoners.Had≈æihasanoviƒá & Kubura Appeals Only Partially Granted In the judgment, the judges concluded that the Mujahideen were responsible for execution of 4 Croatian civilians in the village of Miletiƒái in April 1993, inhumanely treating POWs and killing one at the Ora≈°ac camp in October 1993, damaged and vandalized the Guƒça Gora Monastery in June 1993 and also the Church of St. John the Baptist in Travnik.Summary of the Judgement for Had≈æihasanoviƒá and Kubura According to the indictment of Rasim Deliƒá, Commander of Main Staff of the Bosnian army (ARBiH) at the time, after the formation of the 7th Muslim Brigade on 19 November 1992, prosecution tried to prove that battalion was subordinated within its structure. According to a UN communiqu√© of 1995, the battalion was \\"directly dependent on Bosnian staff for supplies\\" and for \\"directions\\" during combat with the Serb forces. The issue has formed part of two ICTY war crimes trials against two aforementioned Kubura and Had≈æihasanoviƒá on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. The Trial Chamber judgement in the case of ICTY v. Enver Had≈æihasanoviƒá and Kubura, commander of the ARBiH 3rd Corps and commander of the 7th Muslim Brigade of the 3rd Corps of the ARBiH, the Trial Chamber found that the foreign mujahedin were not officially part of the 3rd Corps or the 7th Brigade of the ARBiH. Accordingly, the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the foreign mujahedin officially joined the ARBiH and that they were de iure subordinated to the accused Had≈æihasanoviƒá and Kubura. At the end, the final judgement of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in April 2008 concluded that the relationship between the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army headed by Had≈æihasanoviƒá and the El Mud≈æahid detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as if they were a distinct enemy force. Propaganda and political abuse Although Serbian and Croatian media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by the squad, no indictment was issued by International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia against any of these foreign volunteers. The only foreign person convicted of war crimes was Swedish neo-Nazi Jackie Arkl√∂v, who fought in the Croatian army (first convicted by a Bosnian court, later by a Swedish court). According to the ICTY verdicts, Serb propaganda was very active, constantly propagating false information about the foreign fighters in order to inflame anti-Muslim hatred among Serbs. After the takeover of Prijedor by Serb forces in 1992, Radio Prijedor propagated Serb nationalistic ideas characterising prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished. One example of such propaganda was the derogatory language used for referring to non-Serbs such as \\"Mujahedin\\", \\"Usta≈°e\\" or \\"Green Berets\\", although at the time there were no foreign volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ICTY concluded in the Milomir Stakiƒá verdict that, Mile Mutiƒá, the director of the local paper Kozarski Vjesnik and the journalist Rade Mutiƒá regularly attended meetings with high ranking Serb politicians and local authorities in order to be informed about the next steps for spreading propaganda. Another example of propaganda about \\"Islamic holy warriors\\" is presented in the ICTY Kordiƒá and ƒåerkez verdict for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia leadership against Bosniak civilians. According to verdict Gornji Vakuf was attacked by Croatian Defence Council (HVO) in January 1993 followed by heavy shelling of the town by Croat artillery. During cease-fire negotiations at the Britbat HQ in Gornji Vakuf, Colonel Andriƒá, representing the HVO, demanded that the Bosnian forces lay down their arms and accept HVO control of the town, threatening that if they did not agree he would flatten Gornji Vakuf to the ground. The HVO demands were not accepted by the Bosnian Army and the attack continued, followed by massacres on Bosnian Muslim civilians in the neighbouring villages of Bistrica, Uzriƒçje, Du≈°a, ≈Ωdrimci and Hrasnica. The shelling campaign and the attacks during the war resulted in hundreds of injured and killed, mostly Bosnian Muslim civilians. Although Croats often cited it as a major reason for the attack on Gornji Vakuf in order to justify attacks and massacres on civilians, the commander of the UN Britbat company claimed that there were no Muslim \\"holy warriors\\" in Gornji Vakuf and that his soldiers did not see any. According to Predrag Matvejeviƒá, the number of Arab volunteers who came to help the Bosnian Muslims, \\"was much smaller than the number presented by Serb and Croat propaganda\\". Contemporary examples with high profile public and political individuals and civil servants involved in perpetuating unsubstantiated claims are noteworthy, such as Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, Czech President Milos Zeman, or Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá who stated in 2017 that Bosnia and Herzegovina is hub of Islamic terrorism with more than 10,000 armed Islamists. This statement prompted Croatian media to adopt alleged terrorists in Bosnia narrative as an ongoing theme at the time. Such claims were dismissed by Bosnian officials and local Islamic religious authorities, with Bosnia‚Äôs Security Minister Dragan Mektiƒá being most vocal, even telling the media that there was a possibility of para-secret service agencies staging a bogus terrorist act in order to legitimise false claims of increased Islamic radicalism in Bosnia. Croat side The Croats received support from Croatia and the Croatian Army fought with the local Croatian Defense Council (HVO) forces. Some external fighters included British volunteers as well as other individuals from Catholic countries who fought as volunteers. Dutch, Spanish, Irish, Polish, French, Swedish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Canadian and Finnish volunteers were organized into the Croatian 103rd (International) Infantry Brigade. British, French, Czech, Canadian served in the 108 Brigade of HVO; and one for the French, the \\"groupe Jacques Doriot\\". Many extreme right volunteers from Western Europe, mainly from Germany, joined the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS). Although Russians mainly volunteered on the Serb side, the small neo-Nazi \\"Werewolf\\" unit fought on the Croat side. Swedish Jackie Arkl√∂v fought in Bosnia and was later charged with war crimes upon his return to Sweden. Later he confessed he committed war crimes on Bosniak civilians in the Croatian camps Heliodrom and Dretelj as a member of Croat forces. Serb side The Bosnian Serbs received volunteers from Orthodox Christian countries such as Russia and Greece. These included hundreds of Russians, around 100 Greeks, and some Ukrainians and Romanians. One Japanese volunteer is documented. According to ICTY documents, volunteers from Russia, Greece, and Romania fighting for the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) numbered between at least 500 to more than 1,500. Other estimate vary depending on sources, with some estimate from 529 and 614, other claim that number is well over 1,000 volunteers from Orthodox countries. Michael Innes writes that in April 1994 the VRS consisted of 100,000 men, out of whom 1,000‚Äì1,500 were mercenaries from Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria. Journalist Ljiljana Bulatoviƒá claimed that 49 Russians were killed in the war. Mikhail Polikarpov, a historian and participant in the war, numbered Russian soldiers at the hundreds, about 40 of whom died and 20 injured. These Greek and Russian mercenaries fought for some 200 German marks monthly. Primary Russian forces consisted of two organized units known as \\"–†–î–û-1\\" and \\"–†–î–û-2\\" (–†–î–û stands for \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –î–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –û—Ç—Ä—è–¥\\", which means \\"Russian Volunteer Unit\\"), commanded by Yuriy Belyayev and Alexander Zagrebov, respectively. –†–î–û-2 was also known as \\"Tsarist Wolves\\", because of the monarchist views of its fighters. Another unit of Russian volunteers was composed of hundreds of cossacks, known as the \\"First Cossack Sotnia\\". All these units were operating mainly in Eastern Bosnia along with VRS forces from 1992 up to 1995. In May 1995, the Herzegovina Corp of the VRS intended to organize an international brigade of their own in eastern Bosnia which gathered between 150 and 600 The most notable incident involving Greek Volunteer Guard, who were organized in March 1995 with around 100 soldiers, were reported to have taken part in the Srebrenica Massacre, with the Greek flag being hoisted in Srebrenica after the town fell to the Serbs, and organized systemic executions begun.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 190 - 191. History Origins There are several possible origins of the surname Leask. One possibility is that it is a diminutive of the Anglo-Saxon word lisse, which means happy. In the Norse language it means a stirring fellow. Professor Leask of Aberdeen believed that the ancestor of the Leaks was Liscus who was chief of the Haedui, a tribe of Gauls who were described by Julius Caesar during his Gallic Wars. One of the greatest fortresses in France was the Castle of Boulogne, a possession of Charlemagne which at one time belonged to a family called de Lesque. An early reference to the name is that of Erik Leask who was reputedly chamberlain to the king of Denmark. In 1296 William de Laskereske appears on the Ragman Rolls submitting to Edward I of England. In about 1345 William Leask received a charter of confirmation to his lands of Leskgoroune or Leskgaranne from David II of Scotland, son of Robert the Bruce. He might be the same William Leysk who was recorded in the parish records of the church at Ellon, Aberdeenshire as: William de Laysk, the elder, Lord of that Ilk, bequeathed a pound of wax yearly to the altar of the Holyrood in the church of St Mary of Ellon. In 1390 the second known chief of Clan Leask who was ballie of the barony of Findon, inherited half of the lands of Henry de Brogan, Lord of Achlowne. He also appears as a witness to a charter by the Earl of Orkney in 1391. 15th and 16th centuries In the middle of the 15th century a younger son of Leask went to Orkney at the request of the earl, who had formed a court at Kirkwall Palace. There a branch of the Clan Leask was formed which still shows the longest unbroken male lines of the clan. The third chief of Clan Leask, Wilfred, signed a bond of Manrent in favour of William Hay, Earl of Erroll in 1456 and also resigned his lands in favour of his son and heir. From this point onwards the connection with the Clan Hay appears to have remained strong. When the Cheynes of Esslemont allied themselves with the Hays their bond was signed at the Chapel of Laske in 1499. In 1574 following the deposition of Mary, Queen of Scots, William Leask, seventh chief of Clan Leask signed an oath of allegiance to the child James VI of Scotland. 17th century The register of the Privy Seal records that in 1615 a complaint was made from Alexander Leask that Adam Gordon, brother of the Laird of Gight, put violent hands upon him at the Yet of Leask, wounding him grievously. Later that year the Gordons again attacked the Leasks, setting upon a son of the chief for which George Gordon was outlawed. In 1616, William Leask of that Ilk was accosted by John Gordon of Ardlogy and a party of men with pistolets and hagbuts. In 1672 Alexander Leask of that Ilk was amongst the noblemen who recorded their coats of arms in a newly established public register. Towards the end of the seventeenth century disaster overtook the family after they invested in the failed Darien scheme, a trading venture with Central America intended to rival the East India Company that had been established in London. Alexander Leask of that Ilk, the thirteenth chief was forced to give up his estates which were taken over by Robert Cumming. The clan today Little is known of the Clan Leask between the disaster of the late seventeenth century until 1963, when a descendant managed to buy back a portion of the family lands and established the Leask Society, with the support of other prominent Leasks. This includes Lieutenant General Sir Henry Leask, who was a governor of Edinburgh Castle and General Officer commanding the Army in Scotland. In 1968 Moira Anne Helgesen was granted the chiefship of the clan by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, whereupon she changed her name and became: Madam Anne Leask of Leask. She died in April 2008 and was succeeded in the chiefship of the clan by Jonathan Leask, who became the 23rd chief of Clan Leask.Obituary: Madam Anne Leask of Leask See also *Scottish clan References External links *Clan Leask Society *http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/htol/leask2.html Leask ","title":"Clan Leask"},{"id":"7238924","text":"The Belgaum border dispute is a dispute involving the Indian states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. Belgaum is a part of Karnataka and was earlier part of the British India's Bombay Presidency. The Bombay Presidency encompassed present day Gujarat, Maharashtra as well as certain areas of North Karnataka. Background According to the 1881 linguistic census, the total population of Belgaum district was 864,014. Of this 556,397 were Kannada speakers comprising 64.39 percent while 225,008 or 26.04 percent spoke Marathi. Further the census notes that the Marathi speakers were mostly born outside of Belgaum indicating a significant migration in the previous decades. After India became independent in 1947, the Belgaum district (which was in the erstwhile Bombay Presidency) became a part of the Bombay State. In 1948, the Belgaum Municipality that was dominated by Marathi speaking politicians requested the Indian Dominion, Indian Constituent Assembly and the Boundary Commission to include the Belgaum Municipal District in the proposed Samyukta Maharashtra state for the Marathi speakers. In accordance to the established policy of bifurcation on linguistic majority basis, in 1956, the Belgaum district was incorporated into the newly formed Mysore state (now Karnataka) with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, adjoining areas which had majority of Marathi speaking citizens were included in the newly formed Maharashtra state. The Act, which reorganised India's states along linguistic and administrative lines, included Belgaum in the Kannada-majority Karnataka, the district had most of the Marathi-speaking population hence the 'dispute'; According to the Belgaum Gazette published by the British, in the 1881 census, Belgaum had 864,014 people of which 556,397 were Kannada-speaking (64.39%), while 225,008 were Marathi-speaking (26.04%).  Boundary Commission's decision  Belgaum historically has been a part of the Kannada region and has seen many such dynasties ruling over it. But the scenario in the region changed in the 18th century as in other parts of India. This was the period which saw the expansion of the Maratha empire under the Peshwas which culminated in realising the famous saying of \\"Attock to Cuttack\\". Hence a large chunk of Karnataka region formed a part of the then Maratha empire and was called the \\"Southern Maratha Country\\" (most of North Karnataka). By the time the British came to power, this region was dotted by the remnants of Maratha empire ruling over their jagirs and states. But the language of the land essentially remained Kannada. This has been summed up by historian and civil servant of the Bombay presidency John Faithfull Fleet in his book The Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts of the Bombay Presidency (1894), which forms a part of the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (Vol-1, Part-II, Book- III).The Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts of the Bombay Presidency\\"(1894) J.F.Fleet, Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (Vol-1, Part-II, Book-III) The first page of the book explains the ground realities of the time, which goes as, . Hence when linguistic reorganisation of states was decided upon, this was the background available to the Commission as a part of official records and language was the basis. As a result, the resultant Maharashtra didn't include the 'Maratha'-ruled areas of Baroda, Indore or Gwalior except for Kolhapur as the Commission took into consideration all the changes in the region over a long period of time and not just recent changes in demography. Four member Committee Following a memorandum from the Maharashtra government on 23 June 1957, the Government of India constituted Mahajan Committee on 5 June 1960 to look into the case. The four member Committee consisted of two representatives from the Maharashtra Government, and two from the Mysore state Government. But it failed to reach an agreement. Maharashtra wanted to apply following points and agreed to hand over Kannada majority villages to Mysore: # Villages as a unit # Geographical proximity/integrity # Marathi or Kannada speakers \\"relative majority\\"; in case of villages with no population, it should be merged with that state where the owners of that land reside #People's wish Mysore Government, on the other hand, wanted status quo to be maintained. Mahajan Commission Maharashtra leader Senapati Bapat resorted on hunger strike demanding the government to form a commission which would address border dispute. At Maharashtra's insistence, the Government of India constituted the Mahajan Commission on 25 October 1966. V.P. Naik, Maharashtra's Chief Minister at that time, announced in public on 9 November 1967 that Maharashtra will adhere to Mahajan Commission's report, regardless of the outcome. The commission was headed by the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, Meher Chand Mahajan. The commission, upon review of Maharashtra's claims, recommended the exchange of several villages in Belgaum district between the two states, but rejected Maharashtra's claim on Belgaum city. The Mahajan Commission received 2240 memoranda and interviewed 7572 people and submitted its report. Maharashtra had asked for 814 villages besides Belgaum. It was given 262 villages including Nippani, Khanapur and Nandgad. Mysore State had claimed 516 villages, of which Maharashtra admitted that 260 were Kannada-speaking ones. It was awarded 247 villages including claim to Solapur. Excerpts of the Mahajan Report Excerpts from the Mahajan committee report regarding rejection of Maharashtra's claim over Belgaum: The following are the summary of Mahajan committee report. # Belgaum to continue in Karnataka # Around 247 villages/places including Jatta, Akkalakote, Sholapur to be part of Karnataka # Around 264 villages/places including Nandagad, Nippani Khanapur to be part of Maharashtra # Kasaragod (of Kerala) to be part of Karnataka The Maharashtra and Kerala government refuted the recommendations of the report and demanded another review of the issue. Maharashtra government termed the findings of the reports as biased and self- contradictory because the \\"formula\\" applied for Kasaragod was not applied for Belgaum. Maharashtra Government insisted that the report is against the \\"wish of people\\" of Belgaum. Kerala, on the other hand, refused to hand over Kasaragod to Karnataka. The Karnataka government, continued to press for the implementation of the report or maintaining status quo. Maharashtra's refutations of the report Maharashtra insisted on 1951 census, as the dispute had arisen due to States Reorganisation Act of 1956. According to 1951 census the percentages of Marathi-speakers (with Kannada-speakers in brackets) were as follows: * Belgaum city: 60% (18.8%) * Shahapur: 57.0% (33.2%) * Belgaum cantonment: 33.6% (20.6%) * Belgaum suburbs: 50.9% (21.8%) The Mahajan commission, however, used 1961 census. According to maps of 1961 census, Belgaum was surrounded by Kannada speaking areas on all sides. Mahajan commission said that its decisions on border dispute is not related with number of Marathi schools and students in Belgaum. Maharashtra insisted that Mahajan Commission is not the final verdict on this dispute and ex-Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi himself had asserted about it. The Maharashtra Government rejected the Mahajan Commission's report claiming that it was biased, illogical and against people's wish. Emergence of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) came into being in 1948 for the sole purpose of getting Belgaum into Maharashtra. 1980s and 1990s The first Belgaum City Corporation (BCC) elections were held in December 1983. The MES-dominated BCC made demands for transfer of Belgaum to Maharashtra in 1990, 1996 and 2001. More than 250 MES-dominated gram and taluk panchayats, and some other municipalities (such as neighbouring Khanapur) passed similar resolutions. In 1986 violence on the issue lead to large-scale arson and nine deaths in Belgaum. During H.D. Deve Gowda's tenure as Chief Minister of Karnataka (1994‚Äì96), Karnataka organisation called Kannada Cheluvarigara Sangha submitted a memorandum to the Karnataka Government, asking it to set up of large industries so that 20,000 to 30,000 people would get employment. The pro-Marathi groups protested against the Government notices and records not being translated in Marathi. The Officials Language Act, 1963 and 1981, states that \\"areas where the linguistic minorities constitute 15 per cent or more of the local population arrangements have to be made to translate government circulars, orders, extracts and land records into the minority language\\". In a letter (DO No RB Kannada CR 09/2000-01), Belgaum's Deputy Commissioner, Shalini Rajneesh reasoned that while suitable instructions had been given to the local authorities for the translation of documents into Marathi, it did not happened because the staff was \\"overloaded with the basic work to be carried out in the official language, that is, Kannada\\". BCC's 2005 resolution On 27 October 2005, the MES-controlled BCC, amidst strong opposition by the Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and few independents, passed a resolution requesting the Karnataka State government and the Supreme Court of India to merge disputed border areas in the districts of Belgaum (including Khanapur, Nipani and Belgaum city), Uttara Kannada (including Karwar and Haliyal) and Bidar (including Bhalki, Aurad and Basavakalyan) with Maharashtra. However, protesting against the resolution the entire opposition parties including Congress, BJP and a few independents boycotted the meeting. The meeting also witnessed heavy verbal clashes between ruling party and the opposition. Assistant Executive Officer, N.D. Achanur advised MES members not to pass a resolution which was against the interest of the state. When MES members did not listen to his advice, the officer walked out of the office. The officials of various departments present to provide details of their departments also walked out. Some members of a pro-Karnataka group called Kannada Rakshana Vedike manhandled the BCC mayor Vijay More, former mayor Shivaji Sunthakar and former legislator B I Patil, when the three were standing outside the Karnataka Legislators' Home in Bangalore. The attackers tore Vijay More's shirt and daubed him with black paint. On 10 November, the Mayor was served with a showcause notice by the Karnataka Government seeking why the resolution should not be cancelled under Section 98 and 99 of the KMC Act. On 17 November, the government cancelled the resolution, without waiting for the Mayor's reply. On 17 November, it served another notice that sought an explanation from the Mayor as to why the BCC should not be dissolved under Section 99 of the KMC Act. On 19 November, T N Chaturvedi, the Governor of Karnataka, criticised BCC during a public function. A group of Kannada organisations set 22 November as the deadline for dissolving BCC and threatened to call a Statewide bandh on 24 November if this was not done. On 21 November 2005, the Karnataka government dissolved the Council, under pressure from Kannada activists, citing violation of Section 18 of the KMC Act. The MES secretary, Maloji Astekar, insisted that the BCC resolution was in accordance with the provisions of the KMC Act, 1976, and the Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. He accused the Karnataka Government of \\"step-motherly treatment\\". The legal team of MES pointed out that both the cancellation of the resolution and the dissolution of the Council were done without giving 15 days' time as was stipulated in the notice to enable the Mayor to submit his explanations. MES called a bandh in protest. A delegation of MES leaders visited Mumbai and met Maharashtra leaders, including Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. Deshmukh wrote letters to Karnataka Chief Minister N. Dharam Singh and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressing displeasure over the action taken against the BCC. The former mayor of Belgaum, Vijay More, a Dalit, broke down in front of the media in Mumbai on while narrating the atrocities heaped on him by 30 Kannada fanatics. The incident which had happened right in the front of Vidhana Soudha in Bangalore when Kannada activists blackened his face and mercilessly beat him up resulting in a hand fracture. The attackers were angry with a resolution moved by More demanding the inclusion of Belgaum in Maharashtra. When he returned to Belgaum and narrated the incident to fellow corporators, one of them Satish Chavan suffered a massive heart attack and died. In the press conference in Mumbai he broke into tears and said \\"All of us are entitled to our opinions. But physical attacks are no way of settling differences\\", he stated. Vasant Patil, former MLA from Belgaum, said for the past several decades the Marathi- speaking population of Belgaum (population 5 lakh) have been putting up with a host of atrocities heaped on them by successive governments of Karnataka. \\"But we are determined to get justice\\", he added. MES's legal challenge to the dissolution After the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES)-headed Belgaum City Corporation (BCC) was dissolved, the MES said that it was going to challenge the dissolution in the Karnataka High Court, protesting that the move discriminates against Marathi-speaking people. The MES had 49 corporators in the 58-strong civic body. The BCC was dissolved on several grounds, including passing a resolution seeking merger of Marathi-speaking areas in the border district with Maharashtra. Anticipating the MES move, the Karnataka Government filed a caveat in the High Court, requesting it not to pass any order without hearing its counsel. The MES said that the government was hasty in taking such a decision when the boundary case was still pending in the Supreme Court. MES's working president Deepak Dalvi alleged that they \\"were being treated like slaves and hence will go to the High Court for justice\\" and that the state government's action was \\"an assault on democracy\\". \\"A civic body elected by the people of Belgaum has been dissolved in an undemocratic manner. The unilateral decision has once again exposed the government's step-motherly treatment of Marathi-speaking people of Belgaum district\\", he added. No other developments about MES's litigation have been reported since then. MES changes stance Later, fearing the dissolution of Belgaum taluk Panchayat, MES, the ruling party which had passed the resolution demanding the merger of Belgaum of Karnataka into Maharashtra, changed its stance and told the government that it had 'just discussed the issue and not passed the resolution'. All the 22 members who were issued showcause notices gave the same answer to the government. The members also appealed government not to take any action including termination of the elected body. Maharashtra's petition in the Supreme Court In December 2005, attempts were also made by Congress led government at the Centre to rekindle discussions on the boundary dispute with the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka and the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But even this effort proved futile as Karnataka continued to press for the implementation of the report and Maharashtra continued to stake its claim on Belgaum city and few other parts of Karnataka. Finally, on 15 March 2006, the Maharashtra government filed a petition in the Supreme Court. Maharashtra staked a claim over Belgaum city citing, in its opinion \\"the feeling of insecurity among the Marathi speaking people living in Karnataka, in the recent days\\". Belgaum district along with Belgaum city continues to be a part of Karnataka state while Maharashtra awaits the Supreme Court's verdict. 2006 developments Maharashtra demands to bring the border region under centre's rule Maharashtra has asked to bring 865 disputed villages including Belgaum under centre's rule until Supreme court's final verdict. N.D Patil, head of legal-committee appointed by Maharashtra government said that Karnataka is intensifying the problem. He added that Marathi people of border region are not able to live with honour and dignity under Karnataka's rule pointing out to the 'unconstitutional' dissolution of Belgaum municipal council and manhandling of Belgaum mayor by Kannada activists at Bangalore. Karnataka Government's Assembly session On 25 September 2006, amidst vociferous protests by MES, the Karnataka state government convened a five-day Assembly session in Belgaum, for the first time outside its capital, Bangalore, to assert its hold over the border city. The Karnataka Government declared that Belgaum will be made Karnataka's second state capital but later Karnataka home-minister denied it.http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct82006/state1834352006107.asp The Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy declared that the joint legislative session will be held every year in Belgaum, and a mini Vidhana Soudha (state secretariat) will be built in the city. The Houses unanimously adopted a resolution, endorsing the Mahajan Commission report which declared Belgaum a part of Karnataka. This is the fifth time that Karnataka has passed such a resolution, the first being in 1967 when S Nijalingappa was the CM. Congress, the opposition party in the Karnataka State dubbed the Belgaum session \\"a gimmick and a waste of funds\\". Ironically, the decision to hold the legislative session at Belgaum was taken by the previous Dharam Singh government, when Congress was in power. MES Mahamelava On the same day of the Assembly session, the MES organised a mahamelava (\\"The Great Meet-up\\"), which received a huge response. The mahamelava was attended by the Maharashtra deputy Chief Minister, R. R. Patil and many leaders from Shiv Sena, NCP and MES. Speaking to a gathering of about 50,000 people, R.R. Patil stated that if Belgaum and other Marathi-speaking areas were not merged with Maharashtra there would be no alternative but to take to the streets. R R Patil said that \\"public opinion cannot be changed by using police force. Never in world history has anyone been able to change public opinion through use of force\\". The convention was intended to send a strong message \\"to all concerned\\" that the 10 crore people of Maharashtra were with the Marathi-speaking populace of the border areas in their \\"struggle\\". The leaders ridiculed the Karnataka Government's assembly session and vowed to merge Belgaum and adjoining areas to Maharashtra. The Karnataka Government condemned R R Patil's address. It announced that Belgaum (Belgaon in Marathi) will be renamed to Belagavi. Karnataka bandh Karnataka Border Agitation Committee, an umbrella body of pro-Kannada outfits, called a statewide bandh in Karnataka in October 2006. The bandh was called to press for the implementation of Mahajan Commission report and to protest what the organisers called \\"step-motherly\\" treatment of the state by the Centre. The Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy's appeal to call of the bandh was turned down by the organizers. BJP and JD(S), the ruling coalition partners in Karnataka extended their support to the bandh. The bandh affected the normal life in Bangalore in other parts of Karnataka. The bandh was total in most parts of Karnataka except coastal districts and Tumkur where it didn't evoke expected response. In Bangalore, the bandh was total and incident free. Information technology and BPO industries in Bangalore closed down their facilities. The other reasons for declaring holiday by these organisations were non-availability of public transport and disruption of traffic by activists supporting the bandh. During the bandh, Kannada Rakshana Vedike members allegedly tore Marathi signboards and saffron flags and forced the residents of Belgaum to stop the business. Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti answered the Vedike members in similar way and alleged that the Karnataka bandh was backed by Karnataka Police. Karnataka Police later arrested many Marathi residents which was criticised by Marathi speakers who expressed displeasure as police didn't take action against Kannada chauvinists. Maharashtra home-minister R.R.Patil warned that torture against Marathi speakers will result into similar response by them. Yuvamelava Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti organised Yuvamelvala (Youth convention) at Khanapur on 26 October 2006. It was well received and attended by Maharashtra's leader of opposition, Ramdas Kadam and state-minister, Hassan Mushrif. Marathi people in border region once again resoluted to merge with Maharashtra. Kadam warned Karnataka that atrocities against Maharashtrians will result in similar response against Kannadigas in Maharashtra. Speakers at convention said imposition of Kannada and troubling Marathi people of border region won't suppress the Belgaum struggle. MES leaders said the success of mahamelava forced Karnataka to cancel its decision of making Belgaum the 2nd capital. The situation was tense in Khanapura for the whole day because of the violence which erupted when MES activists tried to remove Kannada boards from shops. The posters and boards, Marathi youth were carrying in the name of Melava showed Kannadigas in a shabby manner. Violence was sparked when attendants clashed with police during the event. Police had to resort for lati charge and shells to disperse the mob when youths pelted stones at police. More than 50 people were injured and about 25 vehicles were damaged. Police allegedly went from house to house to search and book miscreants. They were interrogating everyone with saffron clotes and flags on streets. MES activists tried to set the bus on fire on two occasions. They allegedly stoned at people and shops as they moved along. Situation was also tense near Macche and Ganebail near Belgaum as some pro-Maharashtrians hurled stones at the vehicled coming from Khanapur. Police had beat up attendants of MES Yuvamelava and arrested MES leaders and Marathi speakers to ensure peaceful 'Rajyotsava day' which MES plans to celebrate as Black day. The police department framed charges against Ramdas Kadam, opposition leader of Maharashtra assembly and several other Marathi leaders for making instigative speeches against Karnataka and Kannadigas at the Yuva Melava. The police booked cases against Ramdas Kadam under section 153, 153(A), Indian Penal Code(IPC), which would put Kadam in jail for 3 years if proved. Similar charges were framed against Nitin B Patil from Satara. As many as 85 people responsible for violence including MES working president Deepak Dalvi, were sent to 14-day judicial custody. Hearing of the Supreme Court The Supreme Court began its hearing on Maharashtra's petition on 17 January 2007.

VFL career  Boyall debuted for Collingwood as a 16-year-old in the 1935 VFL season. He was not an automatic selection immediately ‚Äì indeed in 1936 Boyall won the Gardiner Medal for best and fairest in the VFL reserves competition. By the end of 1936 he had played only four Senior games. In 1937 Boyall continued to improve in the key position of Centre half-back and his future with Collingwood seemed bright. In 1938 he came equal third in the Brownlow Medal, the League's award for best and fairest.  SANFL career  In 1939 Boyall sought to move from Collingwood to Glenelg in the SANFL but Collingwood refused to clear him. After standing out of football for a year (thus negating Collingwood's claim to his services) Boyall was then able to join Glenelg for the 1940 season. Initially Boyall was both captain and coach, but struggled with the dual role and resigned these appointments midway through 1940. His form improved almost immediately. That Glenelg had recruited \\"an established Victorian\\" was borne out when he won SANFL's highest individual award, the Magarey Medal in 1941. Boyall briefly returned to play for Collingwood during the war years of 1944‚Äì1945, but finished his playing career with Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Camberwell, which he coached in 1947. In 1960 Boyall returned to Glenelg as coach for that season, but without success.

There were several revolutionary workers' movements in various areas of Europe which declared independence under the name of a soviet republic in the immediate aftermath of the First World War. Examples The first Soviet republics were short-lived communist revolutionary governments that were established in what had been the Russian Empire after the October Revolution and under its influence. These states included some such as the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic which won independence from Russia during the civil war period. Others such as the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia later became union republics of the Soviet Union and are now independent states. Still others such as the Kuban Soviet Republic and the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic were absorbed into other polities and no longer formally exist under those names.

It is found on the continental shelves of the northeast Atlantic, between latitudes 61¬∞ N and 16¬∞ N, from the surface to a depth of . It can grow up to a length of . Description The starry smooth-hound grows to a length of about . It is grey or greyish-brown with a scattering of small white spots on its dorsal (upper) surface and white on its ventral (under) surface. It is a long, lean fish with a somewhat rounded snout and rows of shallowly projecting teeth. The two dorsal fins are of similar shape, but the hindmost one is a little smaller than the foremost. A notch occurs in the upper lobe of the caudal fin and the lower lobe is of medium size. Distribution and habitat This species of houndshark is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from southern Norway, Scotland, and the North Sea southwards to Algeria, Morocco, and Western Sahara. It is found in the whole of the Mediterranean, but not in the Black Sea. It is found on the continental shelf and around islands at depths to at least and prefers places where the seabed is sand or gravel. Biology The starry smooth-hound mostly feeds on crustaceans, such as crabs, lobsters, and slipper lobsters, and molluscs. It matures at a length of about . It is an ovoviviparous fish, retaining its eggs in its oviduct where the young are nourished by the egg yolk and the oviduct's secretions. Seven to 15 young are in a litter, and they are about long at birth. Status The IUCN, in its Red List of Threatened Species lists the starry smooth-hound as \\"Least Concern\\". The justification for this is that it has a wide range and is common in the northern part of its range where its population seems to be steady. In the Mediterranean Sea, it is less common and is targeted for human consumption along with the closely related common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus). Numbers in the Mediterranean have dwindled and in this region it might qualify for \\"Vulnerable\\" status were it not plentiful elsewhere.

Juan de Ugarte, S.J., (1662‚Äì1730) was a Jesuit missionary and explorer in Baja California Sur, New Spain, and the successor to Juan Mar√≠a de Salvatierra as head of the peninsula's missions. Ugarte was born in Tegucigalpa, then in the Kingdom of Guatemala, part of New Spain, today Honduras. He went to Mexico to enter the Society of Jesus in 1679. His younger brother, Pedro de Ugarte, was also a Jesuit missionary in Baja California. After his ordination, he was assigned to teach philosophy at the Colegio M√°ximo de San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City. It was there that he came to know two fellow Jesuits coming from Europe who were headed to the missions on the frontier of the Spanish Empire, the Italian Salvatierra and the Italo- German Eusebio Kino. Through conversing with them, Ugarte chose to commit his life to these missions as well.Baja California \\"Juan de Ugarte\\" Ugarte was initially the procurator for the newly established missions of California in 1697‚Äì1700. As such, he was stationed in Mexico City, administering the Pious Fund of the Californias, a fund of private donations that supported the missions, and seeing to the logistical support necessary to sustain them. In 1701, Ugarte went to the peninsula as its third missionary, following in the footsteps of Salvatierra and Francisco Mar√≠a Piccolo. Stopping first at Mission Loreto, he proceeded to Mission San Francisco Javier which had been abandoned the previous year due to threats from the native population, arriving there in 1702. It was there that he established his home for the rest of his life, among the Cochim√≠ Indians. Ugarte was an able and energetic leader in the expansion and development of the mission system. He served as visitador or Visitator for the missions in Salvatierra's absence and after the latter's death in 1717. Ugarte led several expeditions of overland exploration to seek out mission or visita sites in the region surrounding San Javier. More spectacularly, he oversaw the construction of a ship, \\"El Triunfo de la Cruz\\", from locally harvested lumber called gueribo found at La Sierra \\"La Giganta\\". In September 1720, Ugarte sailed his new ship from Loreto to La Paz to help found a new mission there. In the following year, he sailed to the head of the Gulf of California, trying to resolve the longstanding question of whether California was an island or a peninsula. He died at Mission San Francisco Javier in 1730.Baja California References ;Sources * Crosby, Harry W. 1994. Antigua California: Mission and Colony on the Peninsular Frontier, 1697‚Äì1768.

Filmed in 13 days, using a cast largely of first-time actors, the film played the gay and lesbian film festival circuit in 1997 and 1998. It was Keitel's first film as a writer-director.Max Harrold, BNET, July 20, 1999. Plot John \\"Griff\\" Griffith, an average college student, is active in his fraternity and lives in the frat house. He has a bunk bed in the room he shares with his best friend Todd Bently, Doogie and his pledge Stewy. Another of his fraternity brothers, Pete Bradley, has moved out of the frat house and into a house he shares with other students. Griff and Pete have a secret sexual relationship, but Griff's close-knit fraternity life puts a strain on it. Griff is satisfied with the arrangement, but Pete is not. Griff, Doogie, Todd, and Heather are studying at the library. Pete is also there browsing the stacks and overhears Griff inviting girl flirt Gretchen to a fraternity party. Pete storms out of the library with Griff quickly following. Griff tackles Pete and straddles him and asks, \\"What's your problem?\\" and \\"Come on Pete, what do you want from me?\\" Pete tells Griff that you're my problem and tells him, \\"I want to wake up next to you, read the newspaper, and maybe go out on a date.\\" Griff realizes that Pete is ready to break up with him so Griff quickly agrees to go on a date with Pete. Griff is annoyed when he discovers that he is meeting Pete at a gay coffeehouse. He runs into Sam, an out, loud, and proud activist, who is passing out flyers for a \\"community action patrol\\" to help prevent gay bashing. The juxtaposition of \\"closeted\\" and \\"out\\" gay people heightens the drama and serves as comic relief at the same time. The \\"date\\" ends with Griff telling Pete that he wants no part of the lifestyle displayed by the coffeehouse's clientele. They both leave and separate in anger with Pete walking up a dark alley and Griff getting into his Jeep. Griff then notices a black truck, going up the alley after Pete. The next day Griff and his fraternity brothers are amazed to find out that Pete has been viciously attacked and is comatose in the local hospital. Griff is obviously shocked and disoriented, but the others are concerned about the negative impact on their upcoming rush week of having a gay member of their fraternity. At a special \\"house meeting\\", Buchanan, the head of the house, tells the others that there is a criminal investigation of Pete's attack. The response of some of the fraternity brothers is anything but sympathetic to Pete. When Griff and Todd go to the hospital to see about Pete, they are questioned by Detective Horne, who is investigating the attack, but Griff is silent about being with Pete that night because he would be outing himself at the same time. His deep love for Pete is apparent moments before when he breaks down silently in a stall in the men's room. The tragic situation completely changes Griff: he drifts along in a daze, ignoring his friends, classwork, and fraternity responsibilities. He goes to the coffeehouse, the hospital, the place where Pete was attacked, and Pete's home. He finally meets Pete's female house-mate Rachel, played by Katrina Holden Bronson. Griff asks Rachel if it's okay to get some of Pete's stuff to take to the hospital so he will have something when he's ready to come home. Rachel lets Griff know that Pete really cares about him a lot. Rachel allows Griff in Pete's room where Griff and Pete have spent much time together. At the coffeehouse he sees Denetra, an African American fellow student, and his need to talk with a sympathetic listener motivates him to become friends with her. Griff's continued preoccupation over Pete causes him to forget what he needs to do for the rush party: make sure that the house is well-stocked with alcohol and contact a sorority to invite them to the party. An emotional confrontation between the head of the house and Griff has Todd decide to take a time out with his troubled friend. They drive up into the mountains for the night, and the next morning Todd and Griff are reminiscing about their hikes in the mountains with Pete. Todd finally asks Griff, \\"Are you like in love with him dude?\\" Griff admits to Todd that he has never been so sure of anything as his love for Pete. He then voices his disgust for the way he treated Pete just before he was attacked. Because his failure to give important information to the police was another way he betrayed Pete, he and Todd go right to the police station so that Griff can tell Detective Horne that he was with Pete just before he was attacked and that he saw a black truck going up the alley after him. Pete's father Mr. Bradley has a brief encounter with Griff in the hospital waiting room and sternly tells Griff to never let his son down again. When Griff and Todd get back to the frat house they see Doogie's friend Smitty there with his black truck. Griff realizes that that was the truck that followed Pete, and Todd remembers that Doogie and Stewy were with Smitty the night Pete was attacked. They were Pete's attackers. Stewy admits to the attack when Griff confronts Doogie in the game room. A surprised Denetra walks by the frat house while the police escort Doogie and Stewy out in handcuffs. There is nothing left for Griff to do but move out of the fraternity house and into Pete's place. Griff is called when Pete comes out of his coma. Griff rushes to the hospital to find Pete awake with this parents at his side. Mrs. Bradley has realized that Griff and Pete are really close and convinces Mr. Bradley to join her in the reception area for some coffee so Griff can be alone with Pete. Mr. Bradley shakes Griff's hand and tells him that it's nice to see you again. When he is alone with Pete Griff promises him that what happened will never happen again, and he tells Pete he needs his help in figuring things out as they make their life together. When Pete has fully recovered he and Griff double-date with Todd and Heather at a football game. As couples they appear detached from the fraternity group that is barbecuing near the stadium. Denetra drives up with her date Loretta, whom Heather knows from her English class, and they all go to the game together. In the final scene, which follows during the course of the credits, Pete is shown reading in bed with Griff playfully joining him: Pete's dream becomes a reality.

Lawrence Van Gelder from The New York Times on 9 July 1999 stated the movie \\"plods along, never catching dramatic fire, sometimes suffering from amateurish acting and often relying on its intrusive and treacly music to impart mood and rhythm\\" and \\"good intentions don't necessarily make good drama\\". Emanuel Levy from Variety on 29 June 1997 said \\"modestly agreeable feature directorial debut\\" and it was \\"made with a good deal of charm\\". Mick LaSalle from San Francisco Chronicle on 16 July 1999 noted with \\"more editing\\", it \\"could be a much better movie. It's a decent second-rate picture\\". Wesley Morris from San Francisco Examiner on 16 July 1999 wrote on \\"a budget so low the shoes seem to have walked off and left their strings\\", and it \\"is ransacked by its public- service announcement performances\\". Lasha from gaybook.reviews in 2011 gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, and said \\"moving film about what it means to be true to yourself\\".

The effects of covert incest on children when they become adults are thought to mimic actual incest, although to a lesser degree. This term describes interactions between a parent and child that are exclusive of sexual abuse. Concept Covert incest was defined in the 1980s as an emotionally abusive relationship between a parental figure and child that does not involve incest or sexual intercourse, though it involves similar interpersonal dynamics as a relationship between sexual partners. Defining such relationships as \\"incest\\" has led to criticism of the concept for dramatically loosening the definition of incest, making child abuse seem more prevalent than it actually is and being overused and unsubstantiated. Covert incest is described as occurring when a parent is unable or unwilling to maintain a relationship with another adult and forces the emotional role of a spouse onto their child instead. The child's needs are ignored and instead the relationship exists solely to meet the needs of the parent and the adult may not be aware of the problems created by their actions. The effects of covert incest are thought to mimic actual incest though to a lesser degree, and Kenneth Adams, who originated the concept, describes the victims as having anger or guilt towards parents and problems with self-esteem, addiction and sexual and emotional intimacy. Psychotherapist Roni Weisberg-Ross has noted that the term may not be particularly useful, since it can lead to attributing nearly any possible dysfunctional relationship or problem, becoming \\"a catchall, watered down diagnosis\\". Ross also criticizes the term for its emphasis on children meeting parents' \\"unmet needs\\", noting that children often meet the emotional or other needs of parents, with relationship boundaries frequently blurring and no definition of when this leads to permanent damage or harm. Jungian analyst and author Marion Woodman describes covert incest as \\"unboundaried bonding\\" in which the parent or parents use the child as a mirror to support their needs, rather than mirroring the child in support of the child's emotional development. Alcoholism and other substance addictions are also associated with the occurrence of covert incest.

It is the home field of the University of Louisville Cardinals college baseball team. It hosted the 2007 NCAA Super Regionals, where the Cardinals defeated Oklahoma State two games to one to advance to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. Since then, the Cardinals have hosted an NCAA Division I Baseball Championship every year since the year of 2012. In 2016, the Cardinals ranked 27th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 2,606 per home game. Along with that, the Cardinals have been ranked in the top 10 amongst other collegiate baseball teams in the nation according to Baseball America. Coach Dan McDonnell has been the head coach of the Louisville Cardinals baseball team since the year of 2007 after coming from Ole Miss as an assistant coach. Since making his way to Louisville, he has led the team to four College World Series and seven NCAA Super Regionals. History A game in 2005 The stadium was built on a former \\"brown field\\" site which had been abandoned for over 20 years. The site was split in half when Central Avenue was built through the area, with the original brick office building for the company remaining intact on the north side of the road and the remaining sections bulldozed. The office was refurbished and is now home to the Jewish Hospital Sports Medicine clinic, which was relocated from downtown. There is additional leasable space in the building which features the University of Louisville Family Medicine Clinic, a 24-hour non-emergency medical clinic that is featured by the university's student health insurance. The project to build the stadium was simultaneous with the redevelopment of the southern half of the property on the other side of Central Avenue into a shopping center, with a UofL themed Kroger store as its anchor. All of the site is owned by Faulkner Hinton & Associates, including the stadium itself. UofL currently holds a 99-year lease on the stadium site. At its opening, the stadium had 1,500 chairback seats, with several knolls along the outfield wall which seat an additional 1,000 people. The stadium opened in 2005 and is named after former Louisville baseball player and founder of Long John Silver's, Jim Patterson. Patterson donated $5 million of the complex's $10 million cost. The stadium went through a renovation in 2013 that added another 1,500 chairback seats, which brought the total capacity to 4,000. As part of the renovations, terraces were added behind the seating areas, and the press box and visiting locker rooms were improved.

Their products were very popular in the industrial, scientific, research, medical, education and institutional markets from the late 1960s through the 1980s. As well as the large US market, IVC products were particularly successful in Great Britain were IVC had a subsidiary company, IVC UK Ltd.  IVC 800 series 1 Inch VTR  The IVC 800 series 1 Inch VTR was very popular. 800 series were reel to reel helical 'mid band' professional color VTRs using 1 inch/25mm tape running at 17.2 cm per second/6.77 inches/second. Variants included slow motion and editing models, and all were available in NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. Many special versions were designed and supplied for high bandwidth instrumentation recording. The European versions of the IVC800 in PAL and SECAM were particularly popular in Great Britain, France and Germany where IVC operated subsidiary companies. The VTRs were also branded for Bell & Howell who were a big player in the instrumentation recording market at the time. Bell & Howell also provided some financial support to IVC in the founding days, as well as a number of key engineering and commercial staff. Over 13,000 IVC800 series were sold worldwide from the late 1960s through to 1989. Prices (in 1970) for the 800 series ranged from US$5,000 for the basic 801 record/play machine through to US$10,000 for the 871 insert and assemble edit version. The 800 series, together with spares, accessories, service and support, gave rise to revenues in excess of two hundred million dollars during the 20 year lifetime of the range. IVC's other professional video products contributed a similar amount. The company was a substantial business in both the US and the UK with high tech headquarters at Sunnyvale in the California silicon valley, and at Reading England in the Thames Valley equivalent. Major sales breakthroughs against competition came in 1968 when joint technical trials were held in London by the Inner London Education TV service and The University of London TV service. Both services were mandated to run with full broadcast standards, and were both headed by ex ITV Chief Engineers. The IVC 871 won the trials and subsequently became the ‚Äúde facto‚Äù standard for education broadcast networks in Britain and most of Northern Europe. Other important milestones were choice by the Royal Aircraft Research Establishment for a large number of MOD instrumentation projects, and choice by British Aircraft Corporation for monitoring multiple performance factors on the development models of the supersonic Concorde. In all of the competitive trials leading to multiple sales, the IVC800's 5.0 MHz bandwidth and high S/N ratio were unbeatable in 1‚Äù VTRs at that time. IVC 825A at DC Video ,  IVC UK Ltd  The largest IVC subsidiary company was the British, Reading-based, IVC UK Ltd which not only sold and serviced the IVC800 series (all with a ‚Äú1‚Äù suffix in Europe, eg. 801, 871 etc.) but also designed and produced a range of complementary Digital Time Base Corrctors, Dual Imaging Effects Units, and Zoom Machines. IVC UK Ltd became the most profitable part of the IVC operation and was subsequently purchased by Carlton Communications plc in 1982 giving Carlton an entry into the TV equipment business. IVC UK Ltd went on to outlive its original Californian parent and generated major profits for Carlton. IVC UK Ltd also re-engineered the IVC7000P broadcast portable colour camera in 1975 in order to meet the IBA code of practice. The UK IVC7000P subsequently became the pioneering forerunner of today's field production systems. The IVC7000P was used by LWT, Thames TV, Southern TV, ATV, Grampian TV, Harlech TV, and many of London's independent TV production companies in the 1970s. The R & D and support operations at IVC UK Ltd were particularly strong and went on to engineer many other products, and product variants, not least of which was the world's first Digital Audio transport for Decca records, and then the supply of IVC9000 transports for the world's first Digital Video recording project at the famous Independent Broadcasting Authority research centre in the UK at Crawley Court. After IVC UK Ltd was sold by its Californian parent to Carlton in 1982, the company continued to prosper, with the mid 1980s being particularly profitable. IVC UK Ltd won a Royal Television Society award in 1984 for ‚Äúthe outststanding new product of the year‚Äù, and a Queen's Award for Technology in 1985. It was widely reported that Carlton's ownership did not initially interfere, it was purely a financial investment. However, the success of IVC UK Ltd in producing cash, profits and prestigious awards was beyond Carlton's expectations and encouraged Carlton to buy other businesses in the field, including Cox Electronics and Abekas Video Systems. That in turn led to group rationalisation whereby IVC UK Ltd and Cox were force merged with competitor Abekas. IVC UK and Cox management advised Carlton that such a merger would not work well due to operational style and product overlap, but the advise was not heeded. Key management and engineers left, and the merger was not beneficial to the IVC UK or Cox products. Abekas however gained access to IVC's European sales network and thus achieved a rapid sales boost, albeit a short term one. Carlton then sold the combination to Scitex in 1992, at which time the IVC name was finally lost. The IVC UK premises in Reading have now been converted into a large complex of funeral parlours and associated offices for the high tech, high growth, town of Reading. Ex IVC UK engineers and customers (and indeed others) may see that as a comment on the buying and selling of talented people and businesses.  IVC 9000  One of the last US- designed products was the legendary IVC model 9000 VTR, considered by many experts to be the best analog VTR ever made. It used 2\\" tape, much like the 2\\" Quadruplex format, but using segmented helical scanning for the recording and playback of the video tracks (as opposed to 2\\" Quadruplex's transverse scanning). Vacuum column tape handling and modular plug in electronics made the machine a delight to work with, and the multi generation capability was exceptional. The IVC9000 was also the first production machine to fully meet the complex editing requirements of the PAL eight field sequence. in order to assist with sales and marketing, IVC entered into partnership with Rank Cintel in England for certain sections of the PAL market, and Thomson CSF in France for the SECAM market. Rank and Thomson both contributed to the design costs in return for their exclusive market arrangements. Furthermore, the styling of the IVC 9000 was made to match Rank Cintel's highly successful Broadcast Telecine machines. This arrangement expired when IVC in California ceased operations, at which time all sales and marketing was taken over by IVC UK who had substantial 9000 inventory and were therefore able to continue to supply and support the PAL and SECAM markets. The 9000 was used for the production of many popular television series from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s, as it was capable of higher quality through many more generations than other available products. It was extensively used in mastering and duplication centres where high quality coupled with long head life and low tape wear were important. However, the high R & D costs from the development of the 9000 caused IVC in California to cease operations in the early 1980s, although IVC in the UK and Europe continued and expanded as successful independent businesses. Many engineers and users consider that the IVC9000 with its superior performance should have sold in bigger numbers. The list price of US$80,000 was certainly not a barrier as competing Quad machines generally cost significantly more. However, a battle of 2‚Äù broadcast format wars was waged strongly by the Quad manufacturers who feared for their earlier monopoly. This kept many otherwise enthusiastic customers waiting for an outcome. The irony was that ultimately the battle was overtaken by 1‚Äù format B and C machines which had significantly inferior performance, but far lower prices. Some of the first laserdisc releases on the market from Discovision were mastered by the company using IVC 9000 VTRs for master videotape playback for making glass masters during the laserdisc replication process. Discovision later switched to using 1\\" Type C videotape around the early 1980s for laserdisc mastering when IVC ceased 9000 support in the US. The IVC9000 was (like its smaller sister 800 products) well utilised in Great Britain. The BBC used it in five regions, and many London Independents operated the IVC9000 for mastering and duplication. The final two IVC9000s were installed by IVC UK Ltd in 1980 and ran successfully alongside the many other British 9000 installations using local British-made video heads for over ten years. IVC UK also made video heads for the 1‚Äù 800 series in partnership with local glass bonding ferrite manufacturer Ferrac. These heads enabled operation of both the 1‚Äù and 2‚Äù machines in Britain long after US spares supply ceased. IVC-9000 VTR from DC Video, ,  TBCs, Frame stores, Gemini and Zeno  In the early 1970s IVC entered into an arrangement with UK company Quantel for the design of a Digital Time Base Corrector (TBC) to enable the output of the 800 series VTRs to be synchronous with the studio drives, hence enabling mixing and switching as if the VTR was another studio live source. The result was the IVC2000 in NTSC, and the IVC2001 in PAL and SECAM. These TBCs were the first full eight bit broadcast capable devices and were very well received. Quantel subsequently moved into other areas of digital TV equipment and the arrangement terminated when the 2000/2001 design team left in 1976. Several of the 2000/2001 team subsequently joined IVC UK Ltd in 1978 and then commenced work on a replacement. The result was a more compact and economic TBC, the IVC2002, and a full frame store version, the IVC8000. Both were again well received and sold in large numbers at prices between GB¬£8,000 and GB¬£12,000. They were exclusively designed for PAL and SECAM for IVC UK's European markets, and were designed, supported and manufactured at a new factory facility in Reading England. Their release in 1980 marked the beginning of totally independent operations for IVC UK Ltd. The UK design team grew further as IVC UK Ltd significantly expanded its premises and CAD facilities. This resulted in an entirely new modular design concept leading to further ground breaking digital TV products which included substantial software code. This was considered quite pioneering in the TV equipment business which had been mostly hardware dominated up to that time. The first resulting product was a dual TBC with picture moving effects and mixing, the IVC Gemini, which was released at the 1983 Montreux TV Symposium to packed crowds. Large orders were placed Europe wide, with IVC's early partner Bell & Howell undertaking distribution in some markets not covered by IVC's own network. The Gemini dual TBC was a great success selling for GB¬£15,000 list. It was produced at IVC UK's Reading England factory at the rate of ten per week for many years. The name Gemini was somewhat obviously chosen for the ‚Äútwin‚Äù electronics. Shortly after the release of Gemini, IVC UK Ltd completed the design of the digital zoom and effects unit, Zeno, released at the International Broadcasting Convention in the autumn of 1984, again to crowds of enthusiastic video engineers. The IVC Zeno was promoted as ‚ÄúThe affordable zoom machine‚Äù and carried a list price of GB¬£21,000. At that time competing devices cost more than twice as much. The IVC Zeno was an outstanding success and was produced at IVC UK's Reading England factory alongside the Gemini. Production peaked at six per week during the mid 1980s. The name Zeno was chosen after the ‚ÄúGod of altered images‚Äù.  Other IVC products  In 1979, the IVC-1010, a 1-inch VTR based on the 800 transport, but with new electronics and control systems was introduced. It was capable of recording a 10 MHz bandwidth, designed for medical and scientific markets, but the US operation of IVC did not follow through with volume production. Besides VTRs, IVC also manufactured other types of video equipment, such as studio video cameras and edit controllers. The early color cameras were used in many institutional, scientific and medical applications and were also branded for sale by Bell & Howell. The later broadcast series 7000 cameras were not as widely used due to cheaper competition emerging from far eastern manufacturers by that time, but the pioneering 7000P portable field production camera was re-engineered by IVC UK to meet the IBA broadcast code of practice and then did achieve significant broadcast success in Britain as noted in the IVC UK section above. IVC UK Ltd also designed, equipped and commissioned mobile TV Outside Broadcast vehicles which were sold not only in the UK, but also to emerging TV stations in the Middle East and Africa.

It resembles other snake eagles and was formerly considered conspecific with the short-toed and Beaudouin's snake eagles, to which it is closely related.  Taxonomy  Although originally proposed as separate species, many authors previously considered both the black-chested and Beaudouin's snake eagles to be subspecies of the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus). However, this convention was not followed by all taxonomists, with some citing differences in adult plumage and breeding ranges as evidence in favour of awarding each full species status. Brown (1974) followed this latter view, but cited several instances of alleged hybridization between the three forms which would justify their treatment as a single species under the Biological Species Concept. However, Clark (1999) suggested that these alleged hybridization events may have instead resulted from misidentification of juvenile or subadult black-chested snake eagles as adults of other species. A molecular phylogenetic analysis based on two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear intron showed that the Circaetus snake eagles form a monophyletic group that is sister to the Old World vulture group, Aegypiinae. This study also suggested that the black-chested snake eagle was more closely related to the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus) than to the short-toed snake eagle, supporting its taxonomic recognition as a separate species. However, a different molecular phylogenetic study by Wink and Sauer-G√ºrth (2004) found that the black-chested and short-toed snake eagles form a clade together with the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus). The black-chested snake eagle is thus commonly considered to form a superspecies with the short-toed and Beaudouin's snake eagles.  Identification  Flying with a snake in its beak, Awash National Park, Ethiopia The main identifying character of this bird is its dark brown- black head and chest, to which it owes its name. It is distinguished from the short-toed and Beaudouin's snake eagles by its uniform white lower underparts, in contrast to the darkly blotched belly of the short-toed snake eagle and narrowly barred lower underparts of the Beaudouin's. In flight, the dark head and chest contrast with the lower underparts and underwings, which are both white except for three narrow black terminal bars on the underwings. The sexes are alike in plumage, although the female is appreciably larger. In the field the species may also be confused with the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus); however, it is distinguished from this species by its smaller size, unmarked (not spotted) breast, and white (not brown-black) underwings. The eye is bright yellow-orange in colour, the bill horn-coloured and the legs pale grey and unfeathered below the thigh, as in other snake eagles. The call is a whistled kwo kwo kwo kweeoo.  Distribution  This species has an Afrotropical distribution and can be found throughout southern and East Africa, from Ethiopia and Sudan in the north to South Africa (north of 26S) in the south, ranging as far west as the southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and southeastern Gabon. It is a partial migrant, with many populations in southern Africa and East Africa appearing to be resident year-round, while the species has only ever been recorded as a breeding visitor in Sudan and as a largely non-breeding visitor in Ethiopia and the former Transvaal, where it is considered locally nomadic. However, seasonal movements have been recorded even in areas in which the species is considered resident, for example in Zimbabwe, where there is an influx of birds in the dry winter months.  Habitat  The species inhabits a variety of different habitats, including open acacia and miombo woodlands, grasslands and thornbush savannas, and even semi-arid savanna and desert areas. It avoids mountainous and forested areas. It is usually found singly, although communal roosts of up to 200 birds have been recorded in the non-breeding period. The species is also known to make use of anthropogenic habitats such as farmland and electricity pylons or telephone poles. It is sympatric with the brown snake eagle in much of its range, and the two species have been reported to nest in neighbouring or even the same pylon without apparent animosity.  Feeding Ecology  As its name indicates, this bird feeds mostly on snakes (particularly venomous snakes up to 80 cm. in length), but will also prey on lizards, insects, small mammals and frogs. It mainly hunts from a perch or by hovering or searching the ground, stalking prey on the wing and then parachuting slowly to the ground to capture its prey. The species has also been found to be highly dependent on seasonal fluctuations in small mammal prey availability, with its numbers increasing in accordance with booms in small mammal abundance in the Serengeti National Park. A specimen collected from Morogoro in 1922 was found to have a pellet of rodent fur and a hissing sand snake in its stomach contents.  Reproduction  The black-chested snake eagle nests in trees (typically in the crown of flat-topped acacia, although there is one record of the species nesting in the pine Pinus patula), and typically builds its nests concealed in mistletoe or epiphytic vegetation. The nest itself is a small stick structure. The female will lay only one egg per clutch, which is white and unmarked in appearance. The egg is incubated for 52 days, with the female performing the incubating alone while the male provides her with food. After hatching, the chick remains in the nest for approximately 3 months (90 days). Breeding occurs year-round, although it peaks during the dry winter months in South Africa; in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, the peak time of egg laying has been reported to be between June-July, whereas eggs are laid slightly later in the former Transvaal, around July-August. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, nests containing eggs have been found from February to December, with a peak around April-July (in Zambia) and July-September (in Zimbabwe).  Conservation  The species is categorized as Least Concern by the IUCN and BirdLife International. Although widespread, its status varies from uncommon to locally common, and its numbers fluctuate even in areas in which it is believed to be resident. For example, in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park it has been reported to be very abundant in certain years, but very scarce to virtually absent from the area in others. Brown (1982) suggested that these apparent fluctuations in population size may be the result of range overlap between resident and migratory or nomadic populations, although seasonal fluctuations in prey availability may also play a role. Anthropogenic causes of death in the species include the common threats of drowning, shooting, electrocution and collision with power lines. Recovery of seven out of 289 birds ringed between 1948-1998 suggested that drowning in sheer-walled water reservoirs was the most common cause of death (2 birds), followed by shooting and electrocution or collision with power lines (1 bird each). However, anthropogenic mortality appears to be low in this species, with only one black-chested snake eagle found drowned in a water reservoir in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park between 1988‚Äì1994, while five of the seven ringed birds recovered between 1948 and 1998 survived for periods ranging from 3.5 years to 13 years after ringing.

Freeware and in development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. The primary game mode is set in a procedurally generated fantasy world in which the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves, and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy fortress. Critics praised its complex and emergent gameplay but had mixed reactions to its difficulty. The game influenced Minecraft and was selected among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming in 2012. The game has text-based graphics and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has to set in motion a process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Dwarf Fortress, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and possesses specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventurer mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike mode where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing events like organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed. Prior to Dwarf Fortress, Tarn Adams was working on a project called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood which was a role-playing game. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original Armok to Dwarf Fortress after the former became difficult to maintain. Adams calls it his life's work and said in 2011 that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it. The game has a cult following and an active online community. As there is no way to win, every fortress, no matter how successful, is usually destroyed somehow. This prompts the official community motto: \\"Losing is Fun!\\" Gameplay Overview and game modes The game uses text symbols for graphics (unless modified). For example, a dwarf is a colored, bearded smiley-like character and various other letters represent animals. Here, dwarves and livestock can be seen around their wagon of supplies just after embark. Dwarf Fortress has three primary game modes which take place in worlds created by the player, where most of the elements are randomly generated. * Dwarf Fortress mode, a construction and management simulation of a colony of dwarves. There are no objectives, with the player being free to decide how to go about managing the colony and making them interact with the environment, thus making it an open-ended and sandbox-style game. Since there is no way to win, it only ends when the entire colony is defeated by the various possible threats, or the player decides to abandon the fortress. The visuals are text-based using code page 437 characters in various colors as graphics. Thus, it is full of letters, numbers and symbols; for example, a dwarf is represented by the symbol , a cat is a dark grey \\"c\\", a dog is a brown \\"d\\", and a giant spider is a light grey \\"S\\". * Adventurer mode, a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer. * In Legends mode, players can view maps, histories of each civilization and any figure who has lived or died in the generated world. Any noticeable achievement made by the player in any of the two game modes is recorded in the Legends. A testing arena is present, where players can simulate battles between selected units in various conditions. World generation A world being generated and the years being counted. Each game is played in such generated worlds. The first step in Dwarf Fortress is generating a playable world; only one game can be played per world at a time. The player can adjust certain parameters governing size, savagery, mineral occurrences and the length of history. The map shows symbols representing roads, hills, towns and cities of the various civilizations, and it changes as the generation progresses. The process involves procedurally generated basic elements like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature. For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make a swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific type of plant and animal populations. The next phase is erosion‚Äîwhich the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in- game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world. After a few minutes the world is populated and its history develops for the amount of in-game years selected in the history parameter. Civilizations, races and religions spread and wars occur, with the \\"population\\" and \\"deaths\\" counters increasing. The ticker stops at the designated \\"years\\" value, at which point the world can be saved for use in any game mode. Should the player choose to retire a fortress, or should they be defeated, this world will persist and will become available for further games. Dwarf Fortress mode Basics A Dwarf Fortress world map When Dwarf Fortress mode is selected, the player is given the option to choose the embark location in the world. The player can consider the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations which can pose significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress. Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and physical attributes are randomly generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also randomly generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed. The player embarks with the expedition team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), and does not have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will go about it. They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform said task. Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem cutting, glassmaking, and pottery. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has a very important role because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations. Functional mechanics The player initially can see a top-down view of the surface- level of the fortress site; each layer of a z-axis level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level would be seen as its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it dug into a room. The geology in Dwarf Fortress is fairly accurate. Rocks like olivine and gabbro can be dug up. The topmost layer usually consists of sand, clay or plain soil‚Äîthis can be used for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. Fires can spread and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Mineral ores can be mined just like normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their corresponding metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones are used to make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers. Fortress management and growth Underground farming has customized crops like \\"plump helmet\\" mushrooms, which can be brewed to make dwarven wine. As the fortress prospers, migrants come in larger numbers from the mountainhome (the colony's home civilization) and will need further accommodation. Trading caravans, which can be from the various neighboring civilizations including the home civilization, visit the fortress on a yearly basis and are useful for getting supplies not available in the player's fortress area. The role of bookkeeper, manager and broker can be assigned to any dwarf during early game. The bookkeeper maintains records of every item present in the fort, the manager auto-assigns jobs and the broker deals with trading caravans. The production of crafts from any material are useful for trading. The caravans come from civilizations of elves and humans but depending on the embark region and history, they may be absent or sometimes even hostile. Dwarves need to be provided with food and drink (mostly in the form of alcohol). A dwarf will get negative thoughts for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same type of alcohol, making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things like not having a separate bedroom can upset a dwarf. They may make friends and sometimes marry; females give birth. Dwarves can get upset by sustaining injuries, having poor clothing, losing their pets, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their corpses can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may break furniture or attack others. Continuous stress will cause them to throw tantrums and eventually go insane, whether going berserk and attacking their comrades in a homicidal rage, becoming suicidally depressed and jumping off a cliff, or simply going \\"stark raving mad\\" and stumbling around randomly until their untimely death. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well- decorated dining room, medical care, and providing them with a variety of drinks and well-cooked meals. A chain reaction where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more. As the fortress expands and develops, new noble positions become available. While regular dwarves will be happy with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and mandates, getting negative thoughts if they are not fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed. Inspired dwarves will occasionally get into a \\"Strange Mood\\". They will take over a workshop and go searching for the required materials to begin construction of an artifact. If they cannot find the materials, the dwarf will wait at the workshop, demanding it until it is available. After a few in-game weeks, the work results in a legendary artifact, an item so masterfully crafted that it is usually worth more than a beginning fortress' total wealth put together. These artifacts will be added to the world's records and its exact description can be viewed. Through this entire period of being in a strange mood, a dwarf will not eat, drink or sleep and will eventually go insane if prolonged due to any reason. Threats, defense and dwelling deeper The first in-game year will usually consist of kobold thieves and goblin snatchers trying to infiltrate the fortress. Thieves try to steal valuables, while snatchers try to kidnap dwarven children to raise them as future soldiers. Goblin and kobold civilizations near the fortress will always be hostile and a source of frequent attacks. Wildlife is usually harmless, but depending on the fortress' location, more fierce elephants, bears, unicorns, giant spiders and wolves may be a threat. Wealthier and more populated fortresses will get ambushes and sieges from neighboring goblin (or other enemy) civilizations. A thriving fortress will attract certain \\"megabeasts\\" like hydras, titans or dragons, and randomly generated creatures called \\"Forgotten Beasts\\". These unique creatures have randomized physical qualities and abilities, thus giving them the potential to be very powerful. Undead attack mainly in evil biomes or if the player embarks with a Necromancer Tower being near the site. Undead are harder to kill, and often reanimate once they are defeated, with their body parts being separate units to fight. Military squads can be assigned to barracks to train and be equipped with a uniform (armor and a weapon). Squads can be directly commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows can be made for ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, axe blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available. Combat messages being displayed during Adventurer mode. Each message describes weapons striking specific parts of the combatants' bodies with organs getting pierced or limbs getting severed. The combat system in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is displayed by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific part of the character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit, and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, nerves, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital can be set up, where crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, soap for preventing infection, and splints can be provided to help with the healing process. Digging deeper is usually done for finding magma, which, as a fuel source, removes the player's dependence on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or the even bigger, world- spanning, magma sea are found while digging into warm rock. Near the magma sea, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass down through the entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and nearly always bring a fortress to ruin. Adventurer mode Adventurer is the secondary game mode in Dwarf Fortress. Unlike Fortress mode, Adventurer mode has the player control a single character. In Adventurer mode, character creation works similar to other role- playing games, with the player choosing the name, gender, race and personality of the character. Players also select from a choice of various skills and attributes, such as strength and agility. Like in Fortress mode, these skills further improve normally through exercised use unlike regular experience. They play in the same generated worlds, and these worlds continue to develop and advance while time passes as in Fortress mode. The character starts off in a town of their choosing, depending on the character's chosen civilization, and can interact with the various non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs can speak about the surrounding areas or offer to follow and help the player. Quests are given via a \\"rumor\\" system, where rumors can spread among the NPCs, or players can decide to serve a leader and attain more traditional quests from them via an \\"Agreement\\". Characters can also write poems, books and music compositions, based on procedurally generated forms and styles. The player can choose to form a site and build using materials they collect. Players can use the quick travel mode to quickly travel between geographical regions. Like regular characters in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They need to take shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures. Legends mode Legends is the third way of interacting with a generated world, a listing of the events of historical figures, sites such as towns or fortresses, regions and civilizations. Legends also includes a \\"historical map\\" tool in which players can examine conflicts and other activities between civilizations. These generally take the form of sentences describing the actions of the characters, as well as notable completed events. Some historical entries also include notable kills, megabeasts, and allies and enemies within the game world. The character referenced in these details generally have their own historical entries alongside. At any time, the player can create an XML dump in which players can examine history outside of the game. Similarly, players can export detailed maps that show world details such as biome boundaries, rainfall and drainage. History Early development (2002‚Äì2006) One of Tarn and Zach Adams' early works was a text based adventure game called dragslay, written in the BASIC language and influenced by Dungeons and Dragons. This was the brothers' first fantasy project. In high school, Tarn Adams taught himself the C programming language and developed it further. dragslay would later have an important influence on Dwarf Fortress. Adams explained his interest in fantasy games, that he had grown up \\"surrounded by that sort of thing...along with generic sci-fi, generic fantasy is part of our heritage.\\" Years later, before entering graduate school in mathematics, Adams began working on a project he called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood. It was named after a deity in dragslay, originally named for a variable \\"arm_ok\\"‚Äîwhich counted the limbs the player still had attached. This new project was a two-dimensional (would later have 3D graphics) isometric fantasy role-playing game in which the player encountered and fought goblins. Adams took some time off Armok to work on small side-projects, and another one which would inspire Dwarf Fortress was Mutant Miner. It was turn-based loosely inspired by a game called Miner VGA. Mutant Miner involved the player digging underneath buildings, searching for ores and fighting monsters, and carrying radioactive \\"goo\\" back to the surface for application in growing extra limbs and gaining other abilities. Adams was dissatisfied with only having a single miner, and the game began to lag because it was turn-based. Adams said: > [I]nstead of rewriting the game, I thought, well maybe it should be dwarves > instead. And it should be real-time to combat the [lag] problem. Now, you'd > be digging out minerals in a mountain, combating threats inside, and making > little workshops. Then I thought, well, how should the high score list work? > We really like to keep records of plays. Not just high score lists, but > expansive logs. So we'll often try to think of ways to play with the idea. > This time, the idea was to let your adventurer come into the fortress after > you lose and find the goblets you've made, and journals it generates. First release (2006) Adams began working on Dwarf Fortress in October 2002, estimating that the project would take two months, but suspended development soon after, in order to finish his previous work, Armok. He explained that it began like the 1982 arcade game Dig Dug. The Adams brothers started the Bay 12 Games company, launching its website and releasing their games online. Armok became harder to maintain due to him focusing on adding features to Dwarf Fortress instead, in addition to its inferior code and 3D graphics. By 2004, Adams announced on his website that he would be switching his main project to Dwarf Fortress after he struggled to continue working on it. Adams explained that it would be a simulation game with dwarves but kept Adventurer mode as a surprise feature, which was revealed during its release. At that time, his fan base consisted of a few dozen people and more came in when he made this announcement. He put up a PayPal button after a request from a fan; similarly, a subscriber system was added later. In the next five months, they made around $300, which brought in only enough to cover the site's $20 hosting cost. He dubbed the game Slaves to Armok, God of Blood II: Dwarf Fortress; Adams explained that it was a sequel because it continued to work on much of Armok's code but said its cumbersome name was mostly \\"for kicks.\\" Adams decided to focus on the game's development full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at Texas A&M; in 2006. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year. Adams agreed and commented on this, \\"I woke up the morning after I gave notice, like, I can actually make this work.\\" Later, Adams expected he would use his $15,000 savings for a year and then have to get a job in order to support himself because the game had not been released yet. Development continued till 8 August 2006, when the first alpha version (version 0.21.93.19a) was released. Donations reached $800‚Äì1,000 in the following months, this average increased gradually until they were financially stable. He then decided to solely rely on donations. Development (2007‚Äìpresent) According to Adams, Dwarf Fortress is written in an \\"unsanctioned messy combination\\" of C and C++ using a free edition of Microsoft Visual Studio as the IDE. Adams did not use the 3D graphics which Armok had since its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game. Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) because of its randomly generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role- playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation of the world and its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. He further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music. A z-axis was introduced in the 2008 release because he felt the limitations with a single plane increasing; the feature of making various constructions like walls was also added at this time. In the earlier version, players could dig only into a mountainside and not underground because of having only one \\"z-level\\", thus it was considered \\"2D\\". This was significantly easier to maintain due to the limited playable area. Adams commented that this major change was further difficult to implement because of considering details like fluid mechanics and cave-ins. Vampiric and lycanthropic infections with necromancers and undead were added in 2012. On his reliance on PayPal donations, Adams says he is content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, where there is a sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self- sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own‚Äînot being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, \\"Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way.\\" He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it. Enhanced release In March 2019, the Adams announced they will be releasing a paid-for enhanced version of Dwarf Fortress, featuring a graphical tileset and other similar improvements, for Windows computers through Steam and itch.io, published by Kitfox Games. Adams stated this will not affect the ongoing free version of Dwarf Fortress, but due to family situations at the time and the waning income from Patreon, they wanted to find another way to monetize the game. The Steam version will include support for Steam Workshop which allows users to provide modifications to the game. Further updates the latest update was version 0.47.03, with it completing years in development despite being an alpha version. Adams and his brother have a to-do list of features the game should have before version 1.0 and the version number is the percentage progress of its completion. He says he has been able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its large coverage. While regular game development aim to perfect their work for release, he considers that a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. Wired and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called some of its bug fixes unintentional and funny, with PC Gamer saying it makes an entertaining RSS feed to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting his own bed, and the other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms, thus unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years. Adams considers Dwarf Fortress his life's work, and has stated in 2011 that he does not expect version 1.0 to be released for at least another twenty years, and even after that, he would still continue to update it. Adams calls his game an open-ended \\"story generator\\". The game's code base is proprietary, and Adams has stated he has no plans to release it into the open-source domain, citing the risk of them going into financial trouble. He explained he would consider releasing its source if he could not maintain it anymore, seeing different game developers taking it up. He says that he does not mind any modifications as long as he is not put into risk. Adams describes version 1.0 having an Adventurer mode that would be a regular role-playing game, with changing plots and ordering subordinates to perform various tasks. Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger, he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then‚Äîciting numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, \\"sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like sitting down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels.\\" Modern in-game technologies and 3D graphics were fan requests Adams said he would never implement, yet showing ambivalence about the latter if the task was easy enough. Reception The game received attention mainly because of its emergent gameplay, text-based graphics, complexity, poor interface and difficulty. Many reviewers described the game as unusually difficult to learn. It has been compared to other simulation games like SimCity and The Sims, Dungeon Keeper, and roguelike games like NetHack. The game has not had much influence on the mainstream gaming industry because of its non-commercial nature. However, reviewers praised Adams' independence and attention to detail. Gamasutra said, \\"There have been few indie gaming success stories as big as Dwarf Fortress.\\" Wired magazine, following one of its updates, described it as an \\"obtuse, wildly ambitious work-in-progress [that] mashes the brutal dungeon crawling of roguelikes with the detail-oriented creativity of city-building sims.\\" Dwarf Fortress was praised for its depth and complexity. Jonah Weiner from The New York Times stated, \\"Many simulation games offer players a bag of building blocks, but few dangle a bag as deep, or blocks as small and intricately interlocking, as Dwarf Fortress.\\" PC Gamer's Steve Hogarty commented, \\"Dwarf Fortress's reluctance to expend even a joule of energy in prettying itself results in astonishing hidden complexity.\\" Regarding the open-ended nature and emergent gameplay, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith found that with its procedurally generated world and characters simulated \\"down to the most minute detail\\", the game's results are \\"often hilarious, occasionally tragic, and always surprising.\\" Mike Rose from Gamasutra said, \\"...to an outsider looking in on this game so many years into development, with such a wide scope of features and potential play styles, it's fair to say that getting into Dwarf Fortress is perhaps one of the most daunting tasks the video game industry as a whole can provide.\\" The lack of graphics, poor interface and controls were seen as the reasons for the game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, \\"[the game] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill.\\" Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, \\"The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it to do what you want is like teaching a beetle to cook.\\" Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to \\"trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together\\". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy \\"even after hours\\" of gameplay. The editors of Computer Games Magazine presented Dwarf Fortress with their 2006 \\"Best Free Game\\" award. Community Dwarf Fortress has attracted a significant cult following. The game's difficulty, with most fortresses eventually succumbing to various forms of defeat, led to its unofficial slogan \\"Losing is fun!\\" Adams has said that the slogan was originally a throw-away joke from the game manual, and is meant to create comfort with the concept of permadeath. Tarn and Zach Adams answer questions from players on the game's official podcast, \\"Dwarf Fortress Talk\\". Donors receive personalized crayon drawings or short stories from Tarn Adams, and their names are displayed on a \\"Champions' List\\" online. In addition to cash donations, Adams said he has received many in-kind donations. For example, volunteers handle the bug tracking system. Players and members of the community have often written creative interpretations of game events. They have made diaries, short videos, comics and audio depicting their stories whether it involved success or defeat. Besides testing the game, sharing it with others and supporting it through donations, they make suggestions, help newcomers, share stories, and information in the Bay 12 Games forums. They maintain the dedicated wiki; there are also fan-organized podcasts and meet- ups. In 2006, a saga called \\"Boatmurdered\\" where fans passed around a single fortress and each played the game and saved it before sending it to another, was portrayed in detail from the start to its destructive end. This spread around gaming sites and boosted the game's popularity. There have been tutorials on YouTube with one being a 15-part series, and another 12-part written series called \\"The Complete and Utter Newby Tutorial for Dwarf Fortress\\". An illustrated guide to the game, called Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress: Learn to play the most complex video game ever made was released by technology publisher O'Reilly Media in 2012 written by Peter Tyson. Containing 240 pages, it has a foreword from Adams and is updated along with the game's development. On the game's community, Adams said, \\"They are the reason I've been able to make the step from hobbyist to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things.\\" On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, \\"It's really gratifying, because it's one of the things we set out to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game.\\" Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves. Third-party utilities and mods like \\"Dwarf Therapist\\" help players manage toggling labors and skills. The utility \\"Stonesense\\", based on the \\"DFHack\\" library, can render the game in a 3D isometric view. The \\"DF to Minecraft\\" utility allows players view their Dwarf Fortress maps by converting them into Minecraft dungeons. Adams has acknowledged the role of the community in supporting development and endorsed third-party tools, visualizers and interface code; indeed, he has said that he admires third-party developers who create tools for Dwarf Fortress in spite of the fact that the game is closed-source. On 11 June 2016, an event called Dwarfmoot was held at Mox Boarding House in Bellevue, Washington to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the game's release. It was organized by video game developer Kinnon Stephens. The Adams brothers and Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic: The Gathering, attended. Legacy The game influenced Minecraft, which reviewers considered a more user-friendly version of Dwarf Fortress. Adams says he is thankful for the Minecraft developers citing his game because that drew more players. Other games inspired by Dwarf Fortress have largely failed to replicate its visual style and depth. Homages to Dwarf Fortress appear in World of Warcraft. In July 2014, the game won a poll conducted by Turtle Beach as the community's most \\"Beautiful Game\\"; games were nominated by fans posting videos, images or text, and a list was compiled by the community which also contained The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Far Cry 3 and The Last of Us. Justin Ma, one of the developers of FTL: Faster Than Light, commented on its use of text-based graphics, \\"Part of the reason Dwarf Fortress can include a breadth of mechanics unseen in other games is because complex mechanics are expressed in the most simple of visual forms.\\" Gaslamp Games cited it as one their main influences for the game Clockwork Empires. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked Dwarf Fortress 7th on its The 50 Best Free Games On PC list. In February 2019, PC Gamer listed Dwarf Fortress as one of the best open world games.https://www.pcgamer.com/best-open-world-games/ In March 2012, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City exhibited Dwarf Fortress among other games selected to depict the history of video gaming. As new updates are made available, the Museum of Modern Art instantly downloads them and archives them in their server. Curator of the exhibition, Paola Antonelli, said she was amazed by the combination of \\"beautiful aesthetics\\" and \\"mind- boggling\\" complexity in the game. Game designer Craig Ellsworth commended Dwarf Fortress for having a uniquely long \\"staying power\\". According to Ellsworth, it will not be replaced by any other more advanced game of its genre: \\"There is simply no such thing as a flashier Dwarf Fortress, and there can't be, by definition.\\" He predicted that the game's popularity \\"will reach its apex\\" at its final release. Use in academia The game has been the subject of several academic papers investigating a range of fields. These include studies on artificial intelligence, computer game landscapes and computer game pedagogy.

He was mortally wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg defending against Pickett's Charge. Early life Sherrill was born in Greenville, New York,http://localhistory.morrisville.edu/sites/unitinfo/sherrill.htmlhttps://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/infantry/126thInf/126thInfCWN09.pdf where he attended the public schools. He moved to Herkimer County in 1832. He married Emily Eldridge, a daughter of Judge Eldridge of Madison County. The couple moved to Shandaken in 1838, where Sherrill owned a tannery. He entered local politics, holding several political offices. He served as a major in the State Militia. He was elected as a Whig to the 30th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1849. He was a member of the New York State Senate (10th D.) in 1854 and 1855. Three years later, he moved to Brooklyn, then in 1860 to Geneva, where he had a farm. Civil War During the Civil War, he organized the 126th New York Infantry in August 1862 and became its first colonel. His regiment was among the troops defending Harpers Ferry against Joseph B. Kershaw's Confederate brigade of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division during the Maryland Campaign. He was severely wounded with a gunshot through his lower jaw in fighting on Maryland Heights during the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Sherrill was captured and later paroled. The wound never healed, but he temporarily rejoined his regiment at Union Mills, Virginia, in October 1862. After a furlough for further recuperation, he returned for duty on January 27, 1863. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, II Corps, after Col. George L. Willard's death on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg. Sherrill, in his first full day commanding the brigade, was positioned near Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Ridge, when he was mortally wounded on July 3 by a musket shot in the bowels. Carried off the field by men of the 39th New York Infantry, he was taken to the XI Corps field hospital, where he died about 8:00 a.m. the next day. His body was sent by the regimental surgeon to Baltimore for embalming. Lt. Col. James M. Bull, 126th New York Infantry, who filed the brigade's report, giving a detailed account of the artillery barrage on July 3 but not much on the repulse of Pickett's Charge, places Sherrill's death at 4 p.m.Civil War home. He was buried in the Washington Street Cemetery in Geneva, New York.Find-A-Grave Nearly 10,000 people attended his funeral.

He also worked with Lionel Hampton and Buck Clayton. He is also known for starting his cousin Joe McQueen's interest in the saxophone. Life and career Evans was born in Denton, Texas, but spent some of his childhood in Kansas City, Kansas, where his cousin Eddie Durham was a trombonist and guitarist. Durham persuaded him to switch from alto to tenor saxophone, the instrument that ultimately established Evans's reputation. After perfecting his craft in the jam sessions held in the jazz district between Twelfth and Eighteenth streets in Kansas City, Evans returned to Texas in the 1920s and joined the Troy Floyd orchestra in San Antonio in 1929. He stayed with this territory band until it dispersed in 1932. Evans performed for a time with Lionel Hampton and Buck Clayton in Los Angeles, and in the mid-1930s returned to Kansas City to become a featured soloist in Count Basie's big band. For the next three years Evans's prominence as a tenor saxophonist was at its peak, and he participated in musical duels with fellow band member Lester Young. Count Basie's \\"One O'Clock Jump\\" featured the contrasting styles of the two musicians and brought to each the praise of both critics and the general public. Evans's greatest single success was his featured solo on Basie's hit \\"Blue and Sentimental.\\" Evans also made records with jazz musicians such as Harry James, Teddy Wilson, and Lionel Hampton. Evans has been credited with influencing fellow tenorist Buddy Tate ‚Äî who, in 1939, came from the Nat Towles band in Omaha to replace Evans in the Basie band when he died He is also credited for influencing Illinois Jacquet and Arnett Cobb. Although not a prolific composer, Evans wrote a number of well known pieces, including \\"Texas Shuffle\\" and \\"Doggin' Around.\\"  Death  Evans was a member of the Basie Orchestra from September 1936 until his death. * Evans became ill while playing with Basie at the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., sometime during the week from January 13 to January 19. * Evans didn't feel well enough to make the Basie's session with Decca on February 3, 1939; Chu Berry substituted. * Evans collapsed while performing a one-nighter on February 6, 1939, with the Basie band at the Crystal Ballroom in Hartford, Connecticut; he was rushed to Wadsworth Hospital in New York City at 629 West 185th Street. * Evans died February 9, 1939, at the age of 29 of heart disease in New York City while the Basie band was playing a one-nighter in Toledo, Ohio. * Evans' body was transferred to Los Angeles and interred February 14, 1939, St. Valentine's Day, at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.

He was the first Asian in the Straits Settlements to be appointed to the Colonial Legal Service. He was a magistrate at Penang and Crown Counsel, Singapore. After resigning government service, he joined the Lee Rubber Company. He was interested in introducing new construction methods, like lightweight concrete, to bring down building costs and was interested in helping to solve Singapore's housing shortage. These directed his commercial and political activities.The Straits Times, 2 April 1949, Page 8 Background Origins Coming from a Teochew family,Lim, B.

Decision to study law While Koon-Teck was actually really interesting in building things, and had wanted to study architecture; that was a six-year course, and all the money he had for his studies and living abroad were insufficient for that, so he decided to take up law instead.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 1.

Except for some isolated cases, the Malayan Civil Service, and the Colonial Legal Service were the sole province of Europeans. By June 1940, in response to increasingly loud calls from locals for opportunities in the higher positions in Government service, the Straits Settlements Civil Service was created in 1936.The Straits Times, 15 February 1936, Page 12The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 7 June 1940, Page 2The Straits Times, 7 June 1940, Page 11 On 1 August 1940, the Straits Settlements Legal Service was introduced. Both were opened to British subjects who were local-born Asiatics or Eurasians. The salary scale was nearly half of that offered in either the exclusive Malayan Civil Service or Colonial Civil Service.The Straits Times, 24 July 1940, Page 11The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 1 August 1940, Page 5The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 5 August 1940, Page 5The Straits Times, 5 August 1940, Page 9The Straits Times, 12 August 1940, Page 6 His large bungalow house at 1 Pringgit Hill, was just below the house of the Resident. The houses of all other civil servants were situated below Koon- Teck's.

Volunteer Corps Koon-Teck had joined the Volunteer Corps at the same time as he joined Government service in Singapore. While he started as a Private, owing to the high position he held, he was given special training and was promoted, in October 1929, to Second Lieutenant in charge of a Company of 40 men, just a month later.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 3The Straits Times, 26 October 1929, Page 12 He was promoted to Lieutenant from 25 October 1932.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 10 November 1932, Page 3 World War II 1941‚Äì1945 Departure of the British In 1941, after first insisting that British commanders, their troops, and even the local population, should die before allowing an inch of ground to the invaders, Churchill and the chiefs of staff gave the order to surrender. With that order began the withdrawal of British troops from Penang and all of Malaya. On 13 December 1941, fearing the very real possibility of execution for being a magistrate and forbeing an officer of the Straits Settlements Volunteer Corps ‚ÄúC‚Äù Company, Lim Koon Teck and his family prepared to board a ferry and withdraw with the rest of the troops only to be refused entry and told that the ferry was for \\"whites\\" only. Cast aside and deserted by the Colonial masters he had long idolised, Lim Koon Teck could only watch as an entire contingent, including his former colleagues, left. By 16 December 1941, British Officialdom had left Penang.The Straits Times, 17 December 1947, Page 6 After the departure of the British, Lim Cheng Ean and Lim Koon Teck took on themselves the responsibility of cordoning off the main shopping and harbour districts in order to stop looting.Cooper, B.

Hand-over of Penang Before the British left, they had asked Koon-Teck to do what they would not, themselves, do. They had asked him to stay back to keep law and order among the people, and to hand Penang over to the Japanese when the latter arrived. After the Japanese stopped their rain of bombs, a Japanese Lieutenant with 10 men arrived from the mainland on a sampan. Koon- Teck approached the officer and handed over the place as he had been instructed to do. Koon-Teck was asked to take the Lieutenant around and he did so, taking him all over Ayer Itam, after which the officer, having observed that everything was peaceful, instructed Koon-Teck to carry on with his Government of the place. This he did for about a month before the Japanese took complete control.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 2 Japanese occupation legal service Eventually the Magistrate Court began again. Koon-Teck had been offered to take up the post or be taken away by the Japanese Military Police. Conditions in prison were so bad that Koon-Teck avoided sending people there, preferring to let them off with a warning and an extremely light sentence. The Japanese noticed this and after a few months he was replaced with a Malay who became magistrate. They made Koon-Teck Civil District Judge in Penang with a jurisdiction of $500. As no cases of this nature happened, owing to the Japanese occupation, Koon-Teck had no cases to try for the rest of tenure at Penang ‚Äì There had been a gang, looting the homes of the rich, all over Penang. They were caught, taken to the police headquarters, where they were tied up and then publicly beheaded by the lieutenant who had taken over the island. There was no serious trouble from anyone after that.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 3 Saving the lives of 50 British soldiers Three days after the Japanese had taken Penang Island, the prison superintendent approached Koon- Teck and informed him that almost 50 young English soldiers between 18 and 20 years of age, together with a few British residents from Penang Hill who had not heard of the invasion, were squeezed together in the prison, had not eaten in three days, and were dying. Koon-Teck approached the Japanese lieutenant whom he had handed over the island to, and pleaded their case. Koon-Teck was allowed to feed them and this he did out of the stores of food in the godowns controlled by his men. When the Japanese discovered that he was giving those prisoners more than vegetables, salt and rice ‚Äì he had introduced a bit of pork bone that he got from the roadside market ‚Äì they objected. Koon-Teck then went to the Penang General Hospital and discovered a Dr. Evans who had not run away when the others did. Explaining that the prisoners would not live long on the diet they had been allowed, Dr. Evans suggested adding Bovril or some other meat stock into the soup. And this worked. In their weakened state they were susceptible to disease. He then spoke to his superior, a Japanese county court judge who had been made chief judge of the Northern part of the Malayan peninsula. Koon-Teck showed him a book on international law, pointing out that prisoners-of-war should not receive the same treatment as criminals. The prisoners were then removed to Singapore, where they might receive better food and treatment, two weeks after that.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 3 Choong Eng Hye When the war first started, Choong Eng-Hye who had helped Koon-Teck when the latter first arrived in Penang, asked if he could help get some diesel oil for his engines. Eng-Hye was the son of Choong Lye Hock of Hock Hin Brothers, whose family business was in rice and coconut. Instead, Koon-Teck suggested he start the engine with a little of the diesel he had left and then introduce coconut oil, which Eng-Hye had plenty of, when the engine was warm. This worked and Eng-Hye was the only one, among his rivals, who did not have a fuel problem.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 2 Rejoining government service after the war Accused of collaboration, then cleared When the British returned to Penang, everyone, except Third Magistrate Koon-Teck, was called back to their jobs. A month or so later the British Military Police took Koon- Teck away for investigations relating to collaboration with the Japanese. He was freed after about five hours in solitary confinement in an area usually reserved for condemned prisoners awaiting hanging. His wife, Betty, had called up a Judge, who in turn called the Chiefs of the Military Police and the British Military Administration. Koon-Teck put his case for wrongful imprisonment before a Judge who cleared him of all suspicion and praised him for having saved the lives of British soldiers.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 4 Vindicated by honourable discharge on full pension By December 1947 he was made deputy public prosecutor. He was then informed that he would be appointed Ipoh District judge, but, a month after that, still prejudiced against him being local, Koon-Teck was informed that he was being posted to Seremban as registrar of the high court, there, instead ‚Äì the lowest post in the Malayan Civil Service. Koon-Teck objected.The Straits Times, 24 January 1956, Page 7The Straits Times, 18 December 1947, Page 5The Singapore Free Press, 16 August 1947, Page 8 Koon-Teck wrote a letter of complaint for being sent to the lowest possible post despite all he had done to keep order in Penang, the lives he had saved, and his being cleared of all charges of collaboration. He also noted his ill-health. A copy of the letter was sent to the acting chief justice in Kuala Lumpur. In less than a week he received a letter putting him on early retirement at full pension, at just 42 years of age, which was unheard of.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 4 He provided the same testimony before the Malayanisation Commission in January 1956The Straits Times, 24 January 1956, Page 7 The colour bar and the civil service The Straits Settlements were constituted in 1826, and transferred to the Colonial Office in 1867. The Malay States were Federated in 1896. These then correspond with the establishment of their respective civil services.Makepiece, Walter, Gilbert E. Brooke, and Roland St.J. Braddell (eds.). One Hundred Years of Singapore Vol 1. London: John Murray, 1921. Page 70. In 1858 Queen Victoria had proclaimed, \\"That as far as may be, our subjects, of whatever race or creed, shall be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity duly to discharge.\\" There had been no restrictions to the admission of non-European British to the civil services of the Straits Settlements or the Federated Malay States from the date of that proclamation till 1904, when the colonial government secretly and silently, without any announcement, imposed a colour bar in the regulations.The Straits Times, 28 April 1924, Page 11 Up to 1904 the requirement was that \\"cadets must be natural-born British subjects selected by open competitive examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners.\\" In 1905 this was amended that \\"cadets must be natural-born British subjects of European descent,\\" and in 1911 that\\"cadets must be natural-born British subjects of pure European descent on both sides.\\" The last amendment had been made, at that time, by the Secretary for State for the Colonies because there was an Eurasian student then in England who had applied for admission to the examination.\\"The Straits Times, 27 June 1924, Page 9 In February 1912 there were broad protests to the exclusion of non-European British subjects to the Straits Settlements Civil Service.

Beins, Tan Tat Yan, S. A. R. Alsagoff, S. C. Yin, and F. W.

Messrs Nambyar and Tan Cheng Lock were informed that the rule would not be changed.The Straits Times, 15 April 1924, Page 8The Straits Times, 15 April 1924, Page 9The Straits Times, 8 April 1924, Page 9The Straits Times, 14 April 1924, Page 9 At an extraordinary general meeting of the Straits Chinese British Association on Monday 23 June 1924, the members considered the reply of the Colonial Secretary in Council dated Monday 14 April 1924 on the question of the civil service not being open to non-Europeans, which was felt to be unsatisfactory. Other resolutions passed were that the government be requested to state who was responsible for the regulation that excluded non-Europeans; that, if the government was not responsible, that The Association make representations to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies or otherwise take steps to redress grievances; that the civil service and police of the Straits Settlements should be made open to British subjects born or permanently domiciled in the Straits Settlements; that the member of council representing the Chinese community be requested to consult the members of council representing other communities with the view to proposing a motion and having a debate on this subject in council.The Straits Times, 16 June 1924, Page 9The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 24 June 1924, Page 7The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 26 June 1924, Page 5 On 24 June 1924, the Eurasian Association, at their extraordinary general meeting held at St. Andrews School, passed the same resolutions.The Straits Times, 17 June 1924, Page 7The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 25 June 1924, Page 9 Right after that, the majority of those attending the Moslem Association's special general meeting voted to adopt the resolutions already passed by the Straits Chinese and Eurasian associations respecting non-Europeans and the civil service.The Straits Times, 30 June 1924, Page 8The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 30 June 1924, Page 7The Straits Times, 24 June 1924, Page 10 The subject of non- Europeans and the civil service was again brought up at the Legislative Council in August 1927.Malayan Saturday Post, 27 August 1927, Page 20 Asking the question again in August 1932, legislative council member Dr. Noel Clarke was informed that Government was still not prepared to admit non-European British subjects to the civil service.The Straits Times, 24 August 1927, Page 10The Straits Times, 23 August 1927, Page 8The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 23 August 1927, Page 9 The subject was brought up in the Legislative Council in 1932, and the answer again was no.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 10 August 1932, Page 10 Each time the question was raised, a different reason was given, but the answer was always no.The Straits Times, 23 December 1932, Page 19 In March 1933, the Straits Settlements Civil Service for non-Europeans was introduced.Malayan Saturday Post, 29 April 1933, Page 2Malayan Saturday Post, 11 March 1933, Page 2 At the legislative council meeting in May 1933, Dr. Noel Clarke raised an issue. He noted that there were contradictions between what was said by sir George Hicks, Labour member for East Woolwich and Philip Cunliffe-Lister, Secretary of State for the Colonies as reported in the press on 24 March 1933, and what had been said by the colonial secretary at the legislative council meeting of 6 March 1933. From the newspapers, it was given to understand that London acknowledged that there had been discrimination, and further that the Malayan Civil Service was not part of the colonial administrative service, with facilities for local recruitment. However at the previous legislative council meeting, the colonial secretary had said that the Asiatic service should be entirely separate from the Malayan Civil Service proper, the latter being reserved for candidates of pure European descent, while the former was open to Asiatics or Eurasians. He questioned whether Malays born and bred in the colony were admitted into the service as were Malays born and bred in the Malay states. He pointed out that there were inconsistencies in the policy and between what had been said in London and what had more recently been described in Singapore.The Straits Times, 1 May 1933, Page 11 The Malayan Saturday Post in 1933 wrote, \\"The door of the real Civil Service is not opened.

There is to be no open competition with Europeans for any of the plums.\\"Malayan Saturday Post, 6 May 1933, Page 2 After the war, efforts to call for a level playing field, resumed. In 1947 voices were raised in the legislative council, insisting on the removal of the colour bar from the civil services.The Straits Times, 4 July 1947, Page 6The Straits Times, 11 December 1947, Page 6The Straits Times, 2 July 1948, Page 6 There was to be no free access to the civil service. Things only started easing up with the departure of Europeans from the service after 1956.The Straits Times, 7 December 1956, Page 8 War damage compensation When the Joint Malayan Committee on War Damage Compensation was put together in 1946, Koon-Teck was then elected by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to represent Chinese mercantile interests on the committee.The Straits Times, 9 November 1946, Page 3 Lee Rubber had receipts of payments for all its premiums on its $15 million insured but the head of the committee did not want to do anything until all claims were in and so he sat on everything for a year, enjoying his $5,000-a-month salary, free house and car, while Koon-Teck scurried around getting hold of all the other directors of big companies in Singapore and have them prepare and submit their claims. Then Koon-Teck was sent to London to address the authorities there. He related his experience and a senior officer of Lloyd's was sent to Singapore to replace the head of the Claims Committee. All claims were settled within two months, the first being those of Lee Rubber, who recovered $13 million. It seems clear that Lee Rubber did not expect to have recovered this much. Lee Kong-Chian gave Koon-Teck $500,000 in appreciation for managing to recover as much as he had.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Post-war part-time government service There were not enough Public Prosecutors right after the Japanese Occupation and at one time there was an eight-month backlog of cases. Despite all that had been done to him and the way he had been treated in the past, Koon-Teck responded to the Government's appeal and voluntarily went back, on a part-time basis, working for about six months, as Crown Counsel or Public Prosecutor - he was paid half what full- time prosecutors got. But he did not accept the Attorney-General's invitation to return full-tile to the legal profession ‚Äì even with the promise of the Solicitor-General's position a few years after rejoining, Koon-Teck could make $100,000 a year outside compared to, at most, $12,000 a year back in Government service.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Rebuilding Singapore ‚Äì Sennett Housing Committee He was member of The Committee, appointed in April 1947 by Governor Sir Franklin Charles Gimson, to report on housing in Singapore and draw up a preliminary plan for building to relieve the housing shortage. The Committee was chaired by C. W. A. Sennett (the then Commissioner of Lands and Chairman of the Singapore Rural Board). Other members of The Committee included E. C. Cooper representing the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, R. Jumabhoy representing the Indian Chamber of Commerce, S. I. O. Algasoff (Municipal Commissioner), and Teo Cheng-Tian. Koon-Teck represented the interests of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce.The Straits Times, 19 April 1947, Page 1The Straits Times, 23 May 1947, Page 3 The Committee issued its report in August 1948.The Straits Times, 18 August 1948, Page 4 The Committee's programmes for 1950‚Äì1953, were approved by Sir Patrick Abercrombie, British town planner.The Straits Times, 3 February 1949, Page 1 By June 1947 The Committee had inspected possible sites for their $50,000,000 plan to re-house 50,000 low-income members of the population.The Straits Times, 15 June 1947, Page 1 Champion of low-cost homes for low-income people He often criticised Government spending where he felt it was excessive, was sympathetic to the plight of the less fortunate who struggled to have their own homes and encouraged savings among wage-earners. In November 1954, Singapore United Rubber Estates Limited and Sembawang Rubber Estate Limited, two Singapore rubber companies with a joint-multimillion-dollar plan to build low cost houses for sale to the public on installment, appointed Koon-Teck to be on their respective Boards of Directors in London.The Straits Times, 27 November 1954, Page 4The Straits Times, 6 September 1952, Page 9The Straits Times, 28 February 1953, Page 9The Straits Times, 11 August 1952, Page 6 In March 1955 he said that his life's ambition was to build low-cost houses for low-salaried wage-earners. He was, at that time associated with two housing estates whose object was to build 2,000 to 3,000 houses for people with low incomes, and factories producing building materials.The Straits Times, 30 March 1955, Page 2The Straits Times, 21 March 1955, Page 2 By the end of 1955, one of those, Phoo Yong Estate, off the sixth mile Bukit Timah Road, became home to 150 low income families. The houses in estate were priced at $6,000, $8,500 and $12,000. The estates were the property of Lee Kong Chian, to whom Koon Teck was legal adviser.The Straits Times, 13 February 1955, Page 9The Straits Times, 28 November 1954, Page 10 In 1952, he had demonstrated that low cost housing for low-income wage-earners was a very real possibility. By 15 November, over 1,500 people had come to see the block of four cheap \\"package\\" houses completed in 140 hours by 10 workers at cost of $2,000 each. Eace of these came with a bedroom, sitting room, store, kitchen and bathroom, and if wood were to be substituted for steel in the house frame, a lavatory could be added on for free. The estimated labour cost was $500, but, if he chose to, a homeowner could build it himself with the help of an experienced labourer. The estimated cost for installation of light and water was $300 and the amount of land needed was only 500 square feet.The Straits Times, 16 November 1952, Page 9The Straits Times, 12 November 1952, Page 8The Straits Times, 19 July 1952, Page 5The Straits Times, 24 March 1952, Page 5The Straits Times, 27 February 1952, Page 7 Expanding Lee Kong Chian's business Lee Kong Chian, who had been in America during the war, stopped at Penang before proceeding to Singapore. Koon-Teck used to have lunch with Lee Kong-Chian when the former was still Deputy Registrar at Singapore. Kong-Chian decided to stay a night at Penang and used that time in discussion with Koon- Teck. At that point Kong-Chian offered Koon-Teck a job as the former's lawyer. It was 1946 and Koon-Teck returned to Singapore under the employ of Lee Kong- Chian.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 4 Koon-Teck's connection with Lee Kong-Chian went back a long way. They had served together at the Garden Club when the latter was President and the former a member of the Election and the Management committees.Singapore Daily News, 22 November 1932, Page 4The Straits Times, 22 November 1932, Page 12 Kong-Chian was also associated with Koon-Teck's father- in-law, Seow Poh Leng, the two of them having been established businessmen and had served together as long-time members of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce,The Straits Times, 29 July 1929, Page 12 Chinese Association,The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 4 March 1924, Page 7 Straits Settlements Association,The Straits Times, 15 December 1926, Page 12The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 15 December 1926, Page 20 Singapore Chinese Recreation Club,The Straits Times, 19 August 1927, Page 10 board of directors of the Singapore Chinese Girls' School,The Straits Times, 4 July 1931, Page 18 board of directors of the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation Limited,The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 19 June 1935, Page 10 founded earlier by Poh Leng, Rotary Club,The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884‚Äì1942), 12 November 1935, Page 2 Chinese Swimming Club,The Straits Times, 10 February 1936, Page 5 and the Garden Club, where Koon-Teck also served.Singapore Daily News, 22 November 1932, Page 4 Koon-Teck was more of a personal assistant than a legal advisor ‚Äì Lee Rubber had its own solicitors. Initially Koon-Teck was occupied in attending to Lee Kong-Chian's war claims and buying land very cheaply at auctions ‚Äì no one had much money at that time.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 During the Japanese occupation Lee Rubber's property had been seized by the Japanese for their own use. All Japanese property had then been held by the returning British to be used to pay out war damage compensation. After recovering $13 million out of the $15 million claimed, there was very little legal work to be done or legal advice to be given. Lee Kong-Chian gave Koon- Teck a very free hand. And with all the free time he had, Koon-Teck soon found things to do.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Koon-Teck told Kong-Chian about pepper and how he would like to deal in pepper produce. With a nod from the latter, Koon-Teck started the Lee Produce Company, a profitable venture, exporting produce to London.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 He saw an opportunity in real-estate and Koon-Teck soon spent most of his time acquiring property for Lee Kong- Chian, including the Chequer's Hotel, purchased at 24 cents an acre. He attended auctions and bought mostly vacant land. Koon-Teck became a Director and took a closer interest in the company. Koon-Teck told Kong-Chian of his love for building houses, especially to help lowly-paid people like clerks, own their own homes. Kong-Chian told Koon-Teck that he had 50 acres across from Hume Industries on Bukit Timah Road that could be developed. In 1949, with a nod from Lee Kong-Chian, Koon-Teck, all by himself, started and ran a factory, on 50 acres of land at Elias Road, to manufacture concrete blocks. The factory turned out 1,000 special concrete blocks a day at a time when there was a shortage of bricks and homes. His objective was to help build more houses at prices within reach of the working man which he saw as the best way of solving the housing shortage problem.The Straits Times, 23 March 1949, Page 8 He helped solve problems of delays at the Singapore Improvement Trust's Tiong Bahru project caused by a brick shortage by supplying them with 2,000 light cellular concrete blocks.The Singapore Free Press, 1 February 1949, Page 5 Concrete block terraced houses were built on 25 acres and sold (without sewage) for $6,000 each, and semi-detached houses (with sewage) for $10,000. When the Salvation army approached Koon-Teck for help in building a Home for Boys he turned to Kong-Chian who agreed to give them the other 25 acres.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 He bought land cheaply and when others had a genuine need, he would bring their plight to the attention of Lee Kong-Chian. People knew that the way to get to Lee Kong-Chian was through Lim Koon Teck and so when the Government wanted land for a school adjacent to Chequer's Hotel, they approached Koon-Teck. Kong-Chian agreed and the school was named Lee Kuo Chuan School, after Kong-Chian's father. A few acres at the back of the Hotel were sold to the Straits Times at $6 per square foot. And, 12 acres with some shophouses were acquired by Government at approximately $1 per square foot.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited In 1968, he became Chairman of newly formed Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited, listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The company's first year ended 31 March 1969 with a profit and after acquiring Bukit Sembawang Rubber Co. Lt.d of Britain. He served as Chairman till his death.The Straits Times, 11 September 1971, Page 14The Straits Times, 1 July 1976, Page 23The Straits Times, 11 July 1978, Page 15The Straits Times, 2 July 1979, Page 27The Straits Times, 7 July 1980, Page 9The Straits Times, 6 July 1981, Page 1The Straits Times, 5 July 1982, Page 17Singapore Monitor, 30 May 1985, Page 10 Koon-Teck heard that Bukit Sembawang Rubber Estate had short-sold 500 acres to a syndicate for $3,000 an acre, the price the Admiralty and Air Force had paid the estate for much more land that was used for the Seletar Navy and Air bases. He knew that the price ought to have been at least double. He informed Lee Kong-Chian who was dismayed. Lee Kong-Chain had a lot of shares in Bukit Sembawang Estate. At his suggestion Koon-Teck went to London to address the Board of Drectors there and was appointed a Director with a responsibility for Sales.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Koon-Teck's interest in taking up the Directorship with Sembawang Estate was to help people through the construction of low-cost housing. His first project involved 100 acres at Sembawang, Upper Thomson Road, entirely built under his supervision, and sold at prices below that being charged by the syndicate who had bought the land earlier (for Serangoon Gardens estate). between eight and nine hundred houses, selling for between eight and twelve thousand dollars, were sold.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Koon-Teck then looked at Yio Chu Kang Road and began there with Mimosa Park, with the same idea. To sell cheap houses. Koon- Teck was happy to be able to help those less well-to-do get a roof over their heads. He did all he could to keep the price of houses down, often selling 10 to 15 percent below what other developers were charging. Over a thousand houses were built and sold that way.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 5 Building Society of Malaya, Limited Koon-Teck was a Director of the Building Society of Malaya, Limited, for a great many years. The Building Society of Malaya, formed in 1938 by S. H. Peck, closed down in 1942, when Singapore fell. The Society's slogan was, \\"Don't Pay Rent - Buy Your Own Home,\\" and its closely mimicked the methods of British building societies. The Society was re- organised and reopened in August 1948. Koon-Teck, together with Lee Kong- Chian, W. Munro and Ng Sen-Choy were associated with S. H. Peck, as Directors.The Straits Times, 15 August 1948, Page 7Berita Harian, 28 June 1975, Page 8Berita Harian, 26 May 1980, Page 9The Straits Times, 1 June 1981, Page 35The Straits Times, 30 May 1983, Page 25Berita Harian, 28 May 1984, Page 9The Straits Times, 28 May 1984, Page 25The Straits Times, 16 May 1951, Page 7 Other official roles Corporate directorships *Director, Lee RubberThe Straits Times, 27 February 1952, Page 7 *Director, Lee EngineersThe Straits Times, 16 November 1952, Page 9 *Director, Chinese Bankers Trust Co.The Straits Times, 27 November 1956, Page 1 *Director, Hume Industries (Far East) Limited, in 1967The Straits Times, 31 March 1967, Page 19The Straits Times, 7 May 1964, Page 15 *Director, British and Malayan Trustees LimitedThe Straits Times, 4 July 1966, Page 17 *Director of Singapore Land and Investment Company LimitedThe Straits Times, 4 December 1964, Page 20 Non-corporate roles *Vice-president and patron, Singapore Arts Theatre.The Straits Times, 9 December 1951, Page 11 *Fund-raiser, University of Malaya Endowment Fund.The Straits Times, 13 March 1951, Page 4 *Chairman, Committee of Approval regarding evictions from premises belonging to the Singapore Improvement Trust.The Straits Times, 21 July 1949, Page 7 * Member, Board of Management of St. Andrew's Mission Hospital.The Straits Times, 30 April 1949, Page 5 *Founding member, Singapore's Safety First Committee.The Straits Times, 13 June 1948, Page 7 *Member, Elections Committee and Management Committee of the Garden Club.Singapore Daily News, 22 November 1932, Page 4 Independence movement In 1955 a commission to inquire into the Malayanisation of the public services was set up under the Inquiry Commissions Ordinance, 1941.The Straits Times, 1 July 1955, Page 8 Koon-Teck appeared before the commission and told them of how he retired from service in disappointment. While he had applied to join the Colonial Legal Service in 1936, it was only four years later (1940) that he was told he had been appointed. He informed The Commission that he was acting Registrar of the Supreme Court, Singapore, in 1936, when he applied to join the Colonial Legal Service, and was only told he had been appointed to that service four years later, in 1940. At that time the post given to him was one specially created for him ‚Äì Registrar, Civil District Court, which was lower than the post he had when he first joined the service four years earlier. Then the war occurred, and after liberation he was informed that he would be appointed district judge, Ipoh, but a month later he was told that he was to proceed to Seremban as registrar of the high court there. This, he told the commission, was \\"too much,\\" and he retired from the service in 1946.The Straits Times, 24 January 1956, Page 7 He was also a member of the Singapore delegation in the Rahman‚ÄìMarshall talks in 1955.The Straits Times, 31 August 1955, Page 7 In April 1956 Koon-Teck, representing the Liberal Socialist party accompanied Chief Minister David Marshall to London for the first Malayan Independence or Merdeka Constitutional Talks at Lancaster House.

Lim Koon-Teck was also one of a select few included in Singapore's Merdeka Mission to London in 1957. There were five delegates ‚Äì three from the Coalition Government and one each from the Liberal Socialist Party and the People's Action Party. The delegation of five was made up of the Chief Minister, Mr. Lim Yew Hock, the Minister for Education, Mr. Chew Swee Kee, the Assistant Minister for Education, Inche Sidek bin Haji Abdul Hamid, Liberal Socialist Mr Lim Koon Teck and the PAP leader, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.The Straits Times, 6 March 1957, Page 1The Straits Times, 8 March 1957, Page 1 Politics Koon-Teck's interest in the welfare of the people led him to look more closely at the subject of the new independence. He joined the Progressive Party and was made candidate for Paya Lebar. Koon-Teck had wanted Tanglin, where he lived, but party leaders thought that was too easy. Most of the labourers and working-class lived there. So Koon-Teck did not mind and agreed to this.Lim Koon Teck, oral history interview, Oral History Centre, National Archives of Singapore, reel 6 Lim Koon Teck stood for elections for the City in 1949 under the Progressive Party, Paya Lebar in 1955 under the Progressive Party and Aljunied in 1962 under the Singapore Alliance. In December 1958, Lim Koon Teck, former leader of the Liberal Socialists, took his seat on the benches of the Singapore People's Alliance in the Legislative Assembly.The Straits Times, 4 December 1958, Page 11 Taking up his new seat he showed that his position, however, had not changed, when he made a call, in the Legislative Assembly, for the Government to help lower income groups in need of housing, proposing that Government start a 'revolving fund' of $1,000,000 to buy land and sell cheaply as building sites, the proceeds of which could be recycled indefinitely.The Straits Times, 19 December 1958, Page 2 He was unable, under law, to contest in the 30 May 1959 election resulting from the objection to his nomination by an assistant returning officer.The Straits Times, 13 May 1959, Page 12 1949 elections 1949 Legislative Assembly Results for City (1,156):The Straits Times, 3 April 1949, Page 1 16.90% ‚Äì 326‚ÄîPP‚ÄîLim Koon Teck 27.40% ‚Äì 527‚ÄîPP‚ÄîMohamed Kassim bin Oli Mohamed 20.70% ‚Äì 398‚ÄîPP‚ÄîSandy Gurunathan Pillay 19.50% ‚Äì 375‚ÄîIND‚ÄîHassan Ali bin Jivabhai 15.50% ‚Äì 299‚ÄîLP‚ÄîSyed Mumtaz bin Hussain 1955 elections 1955 Legislative Assembly Results for Paya Lebar (12,827):The Straits Times, 3 April 1955, Page 1 52.07% ‚Äì 3,330‚ÄîPP‚ÄîLim Koon Teck 47.93% ‚Äì 3,065‚ÄîDP‚ÄîTan Eng Joo 1963 elections 1963 Legislative Assembly Results for Aljunied (16,152):The Straits Times, 22 September 1963, Page 2 11.05% ‚Äì 1,681‚ÄîSA‚ÄîLim Koon Teck 50.90% ‚Äì 7,745‚ÄîPAP‚ÄîS.

It was named Turkey Flat because of the flocks of Australian Bustard that lived along the creek flats. In 1865 the Schulz family became the owners of the Turkey Flat property. When fourth generation vineyard owners, Peter and Christie Schulz took over the property in 1987 they switched its focus completely over to grape growing and winemaking in the 1990s.Knight- Ridder News Service \\"Down Under Ripe for Grape Growing\\" Rome News-Tribune, 28 June 2000 Old vines The 1847 Shiraz vines at Turkey Flat are believed to the oldest authenticated vines that are still producing fruit for a commercial use. At over a 160 years of age, it is still far behind what is believed to be the world's oldest single grapevine, a ≈Ωametovka vine growing in Maribor in Slovenia that was planted over 400 years ago. Still, while the Slovenian vine only produces enough fruit to make around 25 liters of wine that is not available for public sale, the Shiraz block of Turkey Flat vines produces several cases of wines for commercial use. The 2002 vintage of the old vine Shiraz was even favorably reviewed by American wine critic Robert Parker who described the wine as having \\"glorious fruit with notes of cr√®me de cassis, raspberry liqueur and licorice.\\" The property is also home to old vine Grenache plantings that are over 90 years old with the a block of Grenache vines that were first planted in 1920.

Career Born in Gusenburg, Germany, Alten worked as an artist between 1890 and 1938. Although best known for his land- and seascapes he was also an accomplished portrait, floral, and animal painter. William H. Gerdts, a pre- eminent authority on American regional painting, describes Alten's style as that of a \\"second-generation Impressionist.\\" Alten studied at the acclaimed Acad√©mie Julian and at the Acad√©mie Colarossi where he won a gold medal for the best figure drawing. As early in his career as 1905, Alten was being invited to show his paintings in museum exhibits. During his lifetime, his work was exhibited at the National Academy in New York, The Chicago Institute of Art, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Detroit Institute of Art and other smaller venues. As catalogs from those aforementioned exhibits show, Alten's paintings hung among the works of acclaimed artists such as Childe Hassam, Edward Henry Potthast, Charles Russell, H.O. Tanner, Frederic Remington, O.E. Berninghaus, George Bellows, J.S. Sargent, E.L. Blumenschein, Thomas Eakins, William Merritt Chase, and William Wendt ‚Äì as well as those of his similarly distinguished friends - H.R. Poore of Old Lyme, Connecticut, and E.I. Couse of Taos, New Mexico. According to Gerdts, \\"By 1898 Alten appears to have felt the need for greater professional training and exposure ‚Ä¶ to more cosmopolitan experience in artistic craftsmanship and association.\\" He made a number of voyages to Europe; first to study his craft in Paris (with the help of wealthy patrons) in 1899. Then, attracted to the Hague School of Dutch artists, he spent 1910-11 working in the Netherlands amidst the settings favored by the Maris brothers, Jozef Isra√´ls, Willem Roelofs, and even Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondriaan's (Eng. \\"Mondrian\\") early work. Later, Alten fell under the influence of the work of Spanish painter Joaqu√≠n Sorolla. Several working trips to Spain followed. An exhibit of Alten's sun-drenched canvasses from the 1920s was held at the Holt Galleries in New York City. The Literary Digest for October 12, 1929, featured the showing with an article and a reproduction of one of the Spanish marine scenes on its front cover. This was perhaps the high point of Alten's national recognition. Alten's career entailed an astounding amount of travel; especially given the conditions at the time ‚Äì sea voyages, less than luxurious trains, horse-drawn carriages ... even donkeys. He frequently visited noted art colonies such as √âtaples in France; Old Lyme, Connecticut; Taos, New Mexico; Laguna Beach, California and Tarpon Springs, Florida. But, although Alten painted alongside fellow artists, he never became a resident member of any artists' colony. Nor did he formally, by designation or choice, become a follower of specific \\"schools\\" such as the Fauves in France or the Ashcan School of the Depression era. Alten continued his working trips within the US well into the 1930s, traveling to both coasts, Florida, Taos and always within his beloved West Michigan. His subject matter was notably diverse; landscapes, still lifes, seascapes, animals and portraits - often of judges throughout Michigan, as well as other notables as far afield as California and Oregon. His style evolved in accordance with both the tastes of the times and his own preferences. He never felt pressure to veer into the overtly \\"modernist\\" style which artists of the generation after his frequently embraced. Over the years, various local (West Michigan) arts-affiliated organizations named Alten as an honorary member. Regional and national organizations sought his membership as well. By 1904, he had joined the pioneering Society of Western Artists, one of the era's most influential art organizations. And, in 1916, he was invited to become a member of the National Arts Club in New York. In addition, Alten was a longtime member of Detroit's prestigious Scarab Club by which he was awarded a gold medal for his art in 1920. According to James A. Straub, the compiler of his Catalogue Raisonne, Alten is often referred to as the \\"dean of Michigan painters.\\" Alten died, at age 67, on March 8, 1938, at 1593 East Fulton Street in Grand Rapids, Michigan. That home is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  References  External links * Mathias J. Alten at American Art Gallery *Mathias J.

It is composed of 285 stanzas of four lines of eight-syllables each. The poet-narrator of utenzi offers details of his lineage but never identifies himself. The only old manuscript of the poem known is held in the library of the German Oriental Society in Halle. This copy, which is written in Arabic script, was sent by Ludwig Krapf from Africa (most probably, German East Africa) in 1854. The poem was published in 1887, followed by a Latin-script transliteration in 1894 by Carl Gotthilf B√ºttner. Jan Knappert offered the first English translation in 1967, though he also introduced a number of significant mistranslations. The original title is Chuo cha Utenzi (\\"A book of poetry in utenzi meter\\"). This was changed by B√ºttner to a title he felt was more descriptive.  Plot  A long time ago, the angels Gabriel and Michael had an argument. Both agreed that in the distant past humans were kind and compassionate towards each other. However, while Gabriel held that this was still true, Michael argued that humans had lost the quality of compassion. To settle the dispute, they agreed to carry out a test. The two descended to Medina, where Gabriel appeared at the mosque as a severely ill man and Michael appeared in the marketplace as a physician. The townspeople pitied Gabriel and offered him money to go find a healer. Gabriel said that he knew of one and took them to Michael. Michael stated that he could cure Gabriel but only with the blood of a sacrificed young man, in particular a seventh son who was the only surviving after his six siblings had died in infancy. The only man fitting the description was Kassim, the son of the wealthiest man of the village. The townspeople agreed and explained to Kassim's father, who agreed but said his wife must agree. His wife agreed, but said that Kassim must also agree, which he did. Michael then stated the father must be the one to kill his son. Sorrowing, the father does so. The angels vanish, leaving the townspeople to prepare a burial. In Heaven, Michael agrees with Gabriel that humans still possess exemplary compassion. The angels appeal to God to resurrect Kassim. God grants permission and the angels return to the town as different person, who return to Kassim's family and say that they are hungry and thirsty. The bereaved father tells his wife to prepare food and drink. Gabriel invokes God to bring all seven of the sons to life and the whole town celebrates. The angels return to Heaven, where they prophesy that in the future humans will lose their compassion and become obsessed with their physical well-being and material wealth. The poet concludes by stating that this prophecy has been fulfilled.  Significance  Jan Knappert stated that Utenzi wa Shufaka was important because of its age and because it is one of the most remarkable pieces of Swahili literature, though he did not elaborate on why he thought it was remarkable. In 1920, Alice Werner wrote: > It is difficult to relate this [epic] seriously in English but, strange as > it may seem, it has certain pathos in the original. The emotions of the > parents are dwelt on at great length, and the poem is enormously popular > especially among Swahili women.

It is located at 424 South Washington Avenue. On January 12, 1990, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The house is owned by the Brevard County Board of County Commissioners and operated by the North Brevard Heritage Foundation.  Family History  James Pritchard was born in New York City in 1839. He served in the Confederacy and met his wife Mary Haley Boye in December 1866. After inheriting land from Mary's grandfather, the couple moved to an area near what \\"became Indian River City but was then known as Pritchard's Landing\\". After initially growing sugarcane and citrus, Captain Pritchard became involved in the real estate business. In 1888, Pritchard organized the Indian River State bank and served as its president. In 1891, contractor Pleasant J. Hall began building the Pritchard's new home located on Washington Avenue. Captain Pritchard, his wife Mary, his mother-in- law Frances Delespine Boye, and his children Boud and Kate were the original occupants. Captain Pritchard died in 1926 and is buried at Oaklawn Cemetery in Titusville, Florida. Boud and his wife, Lola Pauline Smith, known as \\"Miss Lovie\\" lived in the house until their deaths. Boud and Miss Lovie's daughter Mary lived in house until 2005, when the house was purchased by Brevard County Board of County Commissioners.  Architecture  The Pritchard House is a two-story wood framed Queen Anne style residence located near downtown Titusville. It is surrounded by a white picket fence and is situated between two major thoroughfares. According to the original paperwork submitted to the National Park Service for the inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places: > The main block of the house is gable front with a slope front gable wing on > the south elevation. Exterior walls imbricated with wood fishscale shingles. > Outstanding features on the main block include decorative ogee shaped > bargeboard with incised scrollwork and drop pendants.

The Pritchard House is the last > remaining Queen Anne residence on South Washington Avenue.  Restoration  In 2003, the owner of the home, Mary Pritchard Schuster sent a letter of intent to District 1 County Commissioner Truman Scarborough offering to sell the home to Brevard County. The house was to be restored in its original location and used as a Living History House Museum. No portion of the land could be sold, a member of the Pritchard family must be included in the organization that operates the museum and if the house ever ceases to operate as a house museum, ownership will revert to the Pritchard family. The county purchased the home and property for $250,000. After Brevard County took ownership of the Pritchard House in 2005, restoration began immediately. Brevard County spent approximately $50,000 fixing the home before leasing it to the North Brevard Heritage Foundation. The North Brevard Heritage Foundation continued to renovate the home and planned to operate it as a museum. The house needed several repairs when Brevard County took possession of it. The foundation needed to be stabilized with concrete footings and hurricane-resistant straps. The porch required a return to historical accuracy. The home's interior needed to be restored as well, including furniture restoration, wallpapering, painting, and flooring. An archeological dig began in 2005 by the Indian River Anthropological Society. Some treasures that were found included an ink bottle, perfume bottle, square nails, ceramic pieces, and children's marbles.  Historical Marker  The North Brevard Heritage Foundation unveiled a state historic marker in December 2005. The marker reads: > Captain James Pritchard bought a lot from Mary Titus, and in the spring of > 1891 contracted Pleasant J. Hall, who had built St. Gabriel's Episcopal > Church, to build a Queen Anne style house of heart pine. It appears today > much like it did then.

Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525 (1958), decided on May 19, 1958, was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that refined the doctrine regarding in what instances courts were required to follow state law. Background of the case Electric power utility company Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., the defendant in this case, provided electric power to subscribers in rural South Carolina. James Earl Byrd, the plaintiff, was employed by R. H. Bouligny, Inc., an independent contractor. Bouligny had a $334,300 contract with Blue Ridge to construct 24 miles of new power lines, the reconversion to higher capacities of about 88 miles of existing lines, and the construction of two new substations and a breaker station. Byrd touched a live wire and suffered injuries while connecting power lines to one of the new substations. He brought a claim against his employer, Bouligny, and collected workmen's compensation, his guaranteed but only remedy for work-related injuries under state law. Byrd then proceeded to bring an action in diversity against Blue Ridge in the District Court for the Western District of South Carolina. Byrd was a resident of the state of North Carolina and Blue Ridge was a South Carolina corporation. Byrd sought damages for injuries allegedly caused by Blue Ridge's negligence. At issue was South Carolina's Workmen's Compensation Act that held that the employees of subcontractors are considered employees of the contractor for the purposes of the Act if, but only if, they perform work that is part of the contractor's trade or business. Additionally, the local judicial interpretation of the Act held that it was a question of law, not fact whether a workman was an employee under the statute, thus to be decided by a judge, not a jury. Byrd argued that the work that Bouligny, Inc. was performing (building electric substations) was not part of Blue Ridge's \\"trade or business.\\" At trial the judge entered judgment for Byrd (agreeing with the plaintiff that substations are not part of a trade or business, as the use of the substations was purely internal, and trade or business required work for someone else). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed judgment for Blue Ridge. The Supreme Court granted certiorari. The Court's decision The question was whether the cause of action brought by the plaintiff was covered by the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act and therefore whether the plaintiff was barred from any other remedy against his employer in connection with the events at issue in the case. The Court, in a majority opinion by Justice William Brennan, first discussed whether the issue should be decided by a jury or by a court, as is the practice (and common law) in South Carolina. The Court noted that while in South Carolina the court decided the question, the rule is not bound up with the definitions and rights of the parties, being purely a practical consideration with irrelevant historic causes, a custom. The Court then addressed the outcome determinative test of York. The Court reasoned that if reaching the same outcome were the only consideration then the federal court would have to follow state practice. However, in addition to the outcome- determinative test of York, the court reasoned the federal courts should consider any countervailing federal policies. In the case, following the state practice would disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between judges and juries and go against \\"the influence - if not the command - of the Seventh Amendment\\" (that guarantees the right of a trial by jury in suits at common law). Thus the Court found that the possibility of a different outcome was less important than perverting the judge-jury function allocations in the American federal system.

Analysis by scholars C. Wright and M.

York, 326 U.S. 99 (1945), was a United States Supreme Court case that described how federal courts were to follow state law. Justice Frankfurter delivered the majority opinion further refining the doctrine set forth in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins. Background The Erie Doctrine, adopted in 1938, held that while Federal law was determinative in procedural matters, state law should control for substantive matters, thus preventing 'forum shopping' between state and Federal courts. The defendant in Guaranty Trust argued that the plaintiff's action was time-barred under a New York statute of limitations. The plaintiff countered that the relevant statute of limitations was \\"procedural,\\" was not \\"substantive\\" law, and therefore was not within the ambit of the doctrine established in the Erie case. Decision of the Court The court dispensed with this substantive/procedural distinction and stated that regardless of whether the case was argued in state or federal court, the outcome should be substantially the same. Thus, the court set forth an \\"outcome determinative test\\" for deciding whether a piece of state law must be obeyed in federal courts--if the outcome is substantively the same then the federal court can apply its own rules instead of state rules. The court held in this case that the New York Statute of limitations be obeyed and the case was reversed and remanded. This rule was refined first in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. and subsequently defined more specifically in a related series of cases over the next few decades.

She has been a political columnist for the English-language Montreal, Quebec newspaper The Gazette as well as Le Devoir, L'Actualite and, currently, Le Journal de Montreal.  Biography  Legault earned a degree in history and political science and subsequently taught at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQ√ÄM). Before the 1995 Quebec referendum, she published a report on the Charter of the French Language (Bill 101). From 1995 to 1998, she was a columnist for Le Devoir. For the Quebec general election of 1998, she defied the party establishment and ran unsuccessfully for the PQ nomination in the Mercier riding for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ). Between 2001 and 2002, she was political counsellor for PQ Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry. The cessation of her employment at this post caused a minor controversy in sovereigntist ranks. The rumours were that she had conflicts with members of the Landry team, notably on the strategy to achieve sovereignty. Perhaps her greatest moment of notoriety came during the 1995 referendum, when Liberal Senator Jacques H√©bert called her a vache s√©paratiste or a separatist cow. H√©bert was roundly criticized for the sexist and insulting remark, but efforts to galvanize separatist forces around this issue were unsuccessful. Additionally to her columns, she was also a regular political panelist on CTV News and is also heard on the airwaves of radio stations CKAC (French language) and CJAD (English language).

It is located at 900 Birch Road. On July 5, 1984, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is named after the Bonnet Lily. History The property was originally acquired in 1895 by Hugh Taylor Birch, a successful Chicago lawyer, and given to his daughter Helen and her husband, artist Frederic Clay Bartlett, as a wedding gift in 1919. Bartlett built a plantation-style home on the property and wintered there with his wife and child from a previous marriage, Frederic Jr, until Helen died in 1925. As a memorial to his late wife Bartlett donated his extensive art collection to the Art Institute of Chicago. Bartlett was a self-taught architect, the main house is based on his interpretation of Caribbean plantation-style architecture. Bartlett then married Evelyn Fortune Lilly, ex-wife of Eli Lilly, and they continued to use the home as a winter residence until his death in 1953 and hers in 1997. She deeded the property in 1983 to the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation, which maintains the property as a historic house museum called the Bonnet House Museum & Gardens. The estate was valued at $35 million, the largest single private donation in state history. In 1988 Jon Nordheimer of The New York Times described it as, \\"an unrivaled time capsule neatly preserved from an era earlier in the century when the wealthy elite could afford a cozy 35-acre winter hideaway in Florida.\\" Layout The principal buildings include; the main house, an art studio, a music studio and a guest house. They are all of vernacular architecture, designed by Bartlett. The estate is . It includes of beach. In April 2015, Bonnet House officials completed five years of negotiations with the city of Fort Lauderdale to designate the stretch of beachfront property in front of it private so that it can host wedding receptions and other private events there without having to get special permits from the city. There are five different ecosystems within the property; primary and secondary dunes, mangrove wetlands, a fresh water slough and a maritime forest. Art studio The first building completed was the art studio. Main house The ceiling of the drawing room in the main house is of mahogany from a large log that washed ashore in a storm. Throughout a motif of pairs reflecting an interest of Frederic and Evelyn Bartlett. Music studio Guest house Modern times In 1987 six thousand visitors took the 90 minute tour of the site. Evelyn Bartlett had a pet monkey and bought 30 to 40 monkeys to live in the trees of the estate. When a local bar, LeClub, that featured monkeys closed they fled to the Bonnet House. In 2014 at least three of them still lived there. Bartlett's sister, Maie Bartlett Heard, founded the Heard Museum in Phoenix with her husband Dwight B. Heard. Since 2003 the Bonnet House has sought to increase revenue by serving as a filming location. It was the Finish Line for the seventh season of the hit CBS reality show The Amazing Race. It also was a filming location for the movie Hoot. In May 2008, the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the building on their list of America's Most Endangered Places. The same year the Bonnet House settled a lawsuit against a developer planning an 18-storey hotel nearby. The settlement included almost half a million dollars for landscaping to obscure the view of the new building. The proposed hotel had been controversial, many people both in favor and opposed spoke at public hearings on the subject. Also in 2008 it was featured in the book, Great Houses of Florida. In 2012 the Bonnet House joined the Riverwalk Arts and Entertainment District as a cultural partner. In 2017 Patrick Shavloske was named chief executive officer.

History  The union was formed as the National Amalgamated Coal Porters Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers in 1890, and affiliated with the Trades Union Congress in 1890. Union membership grew rapidly from 5000 in 1891 to 12,000 in 1892. A major three-week strike occurred in London in 1892, involving 6,000 members of the union, over the employment on a non-union worker and the failure of some employers to pay standard wages. The strike was unsuccessful, but it was agreed through conciliation that the strikers would be re-employed. Following the failure of the strike, the union affiliated to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, but its membership fell, to 4,000 in 1896 and 1,535 in 1910. By 1920 it had recovered somewhat, with a membership of 10,000. In 1922 it merged with 13 other British trade unions to form the Transport and General Workers' Union.

Some of the original buildings are now part of the headquarters for the West London Mental Health NHS Trust (WLMHT). Its first superintendent, Dr William Charles Ellis, was known in his lifetime for his pioneering work and his adherence to his \\"great principle of therapeutic employment\\". Sceptical contemporaries were amazed that such therapy speeded recovery at Hanwell. This greatly pleased the visiting Justices of the Peace as it reduced the long term cost of keeping each patient. Under the third superintendent John Conolly the institution became famous as the first large asylum to dispense with all mechanical restraints. The asylum is next to the village of Hanwell but parochially was in Southall (officially in the 1830s the northern precinct (chapelry) of Norwood). It is about 8 miles or 13 km west of Central London and 6 miles (10 km) south-east of Uxbridge.Ordnance Survey map, 1896 edition The building lies on a gently sloping river gravel terrace, a common feature of the Thames Valley. The land immediately to the east was further eroded by the River Brent, which flows along its eastern perimeter. At its southern boundary is the Grand Union Canal and a flight of six locks. Both the southern wall of the old asylum and the flight of locks have been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument.Ealing Borough Council (2007). St Marks and Canal Conservation Area. Management Plan. Pages 19 Accessed 9 October 2010. History Foundation London County Asylum at Hanwell The layout of the asylum c.1850 Several Acts of Parliament allowed the building of the Asylum, and statutes have driven the subsequent changes in mental health care. The background to the creation of the asylum included the 1808 County Asylums Act which was passed after an expensive war against France. This recognised lunatics as being ill, as being held in the wrong institutions and perhaps having a chance to recover if given the right type of treatment. Non-recovery would mean that the insane pauper would always need to be looked after, which would cost more in the long run. Some parishes were growing in population due to industrialisation, and the existing charitable institutions and workhouses could not cope with the increasing demand. The recognition of insanity as an illness with a possibility of recovery can perhaps be seen as a cost-saving measure as well as a humane one. \\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\\" The 1808 Act was passed to empower county Justices of the Peace (JPs) to construct asylums financed out of the local rates, which proved very unpopular. As JPs faced annual re-election, they often met resistance to this policy. The cost of keeping lunatics in jails and workhouses had previously been charged to their parish of birth, and continued indefinitely as there was no attempt to cure them. To make matters worse, the Corn Laws kept food prices high while the Enclosure Act of 1813 removed the right of poor people to use the common lands to support themselves, causing added mental distress to the already impoverished. Concern grew about the disproportionate number of lunatics in Middlesex. The local judiciary (before whom the lunatics would have appeared charged with various offences or running amok) decided on 15 November 1827 to exercise their powers and build an asylum.Roberts, Andrew (1981) Colonel James Clitherow Middlesex JP and Deputy Lieutenant ‚Äì Metropolitan Commissioner 1828 The asylums index. Middlesex University, London, England. accessed 24 September 2006 In the following year Parliament recognised the barriers to asylum building (mostly financial) and passed the 1828 Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy Act to ensure the 1808 Acts was enforced. Work on the new asylum at Hanwell started in 1829. Most of the land ‚Äì ‚Äì was purchased from the Earl of Jersey. The building contractor was William Cubitt, who completed the work to a tight budget of ¬£64,000. The architect was William Alderson. His neo-classical design consisted of a central octagonal 'panopticon' tower with a basement and two other floors. The windows are tall with semicircular bonded gauge brick arches at the top. There were two wings of one basement and just one other floor in the form of a west‚Äìeast corridor. Both wings turn north, and each terminates at its own panopticon tower, which again has a basement and two floors; the overall building forms three sides of a square. The east side of the central tower was intended for the male patients and the west for the females. With germ theory beginning to be developed around this time, spreading the wards out in this manner was thought to help reduce the spread of infections.Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. . The design also reduced the need to build corridors and saved money. The wards themselves were long and thin with a corridor from one part of the asylum to another running through the ward itself. From the air the design is roughly symmetrical with services: kitchens; laundry; management; chapel and hall (used for parties, theatre and dances) all located in the middle with wards laid out to each side, male to the left of the entrance and female to the right. Hanwell became a model for future hospitals and was copied and modified by the designers of countless other asylums across England and Wales (for example Horton, Colney Hatch, Claybury, or Springfield). The main alternative design being the villa plan (for example Chalfont or Shenley). The central tower was adorned with a monumental clock procured from John Moore & Sons of 38‚Äì9 Clerkenwell Close, London. This was later moved to the Chapel towerLondon Metropolitan Archives: Middlesex Sessions of the Peace: Administration [MA/D/A1 ‚Äì MA/DCP/G]. Messrs. Moore and Son of Clerkenwell Close, clock manufacturers ref. MA/D/A1/081/6/1-2 ‚Äì date: 18 March 1831. Accessed 5 June 2007 when the chapel was built. In November 1829 building work started again on the first extension, and there were further expansions in 1879. The building was designed as a functional work space and home for the treatment of insane paupers, rather than a residence or civic building. This unfortunately led to poor ventilation, and together with overcrowding may be have been the cause of tuberculosis. The main view most people see of the hospital is the elegantly proportioned gatehouse entrance which adjoins the Uxbridge Road. It takes the form of a neoclassical half-circular arch, large and solid, over tall vertical barred, iron gates, which incorporate a small pedestrian gate with its own key lock. On the north side of the building there is a blue Ordnance Survey Bench Mark. This point was measured to be 69.279 feet (21.116 m) above mean sea level. The Victorian era The asylum opened on 16 May 1831 under the administration of the local Committee of Visiting Justices of Middlesex County Council. The first superintendent was Dr William Charles Ellis, who in 1817 had been appointed superintendent to the newly purpose- built West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at Wakefield. His wife, Mildred Ellis, held the post of matron at Hanwell (as she had at Wakefield) from the opening in 1831 until William Ellis' resignation in 1838. It was found essential for recovery that the patients should get out into full daylight for fresh air and exercise, so the ground floor wards had 'airing courts' which were shared by the other wards upstairs. These were pleasantly laid out areas with seating and bounded by walls or railings. Some patients, well into their recovery, were allowed to walk and work in the surrounding fields. The asylum had its own carpentry, bakery and brewery along with many other services and was as self-sufficient as possible. The asylum paid the canal company for taking water from the canal and had its own dock to receive barges. This was very convenient for receiving coal deliveries, which was used not only for heating but for producing gas for lighting. Hanwell Asylum, The Chapel ‚Äì c.1875 Originally planned to house 450 patients, with space for a further 150, its capacity was reduced back to 300, with space for another 150. This was due to fears of an outcry if the local tax rate increased too sharply. At first the number of paupers admitted was low due to the charge of nine shilling per week each, this being higher than the workhouses and jails, but by force of the law the asylum was full within six months and more space was badly needed. In November of the same year, work on building extensions began to address this problem, and so started the almost continuous process of rebuilding and improvements that go on in the present day.Rev H A Norris; Hanwell Asylum: St. Bernard's Hospital London Metropolitan Archives, Ref: 26.21 Han The friends or relatives of a deceased patient were free to remove the remains for burial. Failing this, the deceased were interred in unmarked paupers' graves in the hospitals burial ground. With the 1832 Anatomy Act, the body was first kept in a building called the 'dead house', on the west side of the burial ground (see diagram above). If unclaimed after 72 hours it could be sold to a licensed anatomy school. The Act also provided for the donation of bodies. As autopsies on paupers did not require the coroner's permission, autopsies became common at the hospital. From 1845 the results of these autopsies were recorded in detail by Dr Hitchman.Rev H A Norris; Hanwell Asylum: St. Bernard's Hospital London Metropolitan Archives, Ref: 26.21 Han page 84 right John Conolly took up residence as the third superintendent on 1 June 1839. In April 1839, Serjeant-at-law John Adams, one of the Visiting Justices of the asylum and a founding member and first chairman of Legal & General, suggested that Conolly visit the Lincoln Asylum and see the system operated by Robert Gardiner Hill. He was so impressed by this that he decided to abolish mechanical restraints at Hanwell. This must have taken enormous powers of persuasion: the existing staff would have to change their work practices and learn how to nurse more effectively those patients with troubling behaviour. However, the reform seemed to avoid the patient suffering further trauma as a result of restraint and being made to feel completely helpless. Conolly succeeded in introducing the reform by 21 September 1839, less than 3 months after he took charge. This is perhaps a testament to the earlier work of Ellis. Something of Connolly's success can be gauged from this extract from the first page of the 68th report of the Visiting Justices: Conolly described the therapy in his book The Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraints. Twelfth Night at the Hanwell Asylum. A full-page illustration and short article was published in The Illustrated London News on 15 January 1848 about how Twelfth Night was celebrated at the Hanwell Asylum. In 1888, the earlier 1879 Act of Parliament to facilitate the control and care of Habitual Drunkards was made permanent (and the term 'Habitual Drunkard' changed to 'Inebriate'). As Hanwell would take in such patients for up to a year, this Act was seen as a reason to close the brewery. With the term \\"London County\\" being introduced for the greater London area, the asylum was renamed the London County Asylum in 1889. Early 20th century Aerial view of the hospital c.1920 On 11 June 1910, nurse Hilda Elizabeth Wolsey followed a female patient who climbed one of the fire escapes and then along the guttering of the ward roof. She held on to the patient until help arrived and they could both be lowered to the safety of the ground. For this act of heroism she was awarded the Albert Medal which was exchanged for a more suitable George Cross in 1971. Under the administration of the London County Council from 1918, the asylum was renamed the Hanwell Mental Hospital in 1929. Part of the flight of locks beside the hospital A postcard displaying a arial photograph taken in the first half of the 1920s shows that the nurses' home has still to be built in the top right corner of the frame. It has since been demolished. Further to the top right is the railway iron bridge at the junction of Uxbridge Road (A4020) and Windmill Lane (A4127) which runs south to the left of the frame. Running down the left-hand side is a section of the 'Flight of Locks' on the Grand Union Canal.Post card - SFS No. 1576 - kindly supplied out of the private collection of Paul H. Lang By the 1920s there were sufficient beds to ensure that no person too ill to keep within the laws of the land (or avoid getting misled by others into transgressing the law) need be sent to gaol. Local prison population subsequently fell. The hospital was under the administration of the London County Council until 1948 when responsibility was transferred to the new National Health Service ‚Äì North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. One ward of the hospital was used as the local 'Emergency Medical Services (EMS) centre, to treat war casualties during the Second World War. Several bombs landed on the hospital and its grounds during the war. It was close to two strategic targets: the AEC factory in Windmill Lane which built fighting vehicles, and the Wharncliffe Viaduct which carried the Great Western Railway, a vital transport route. Some of the UXBs fell into the soft sediment of the River Brent, and some may still be there. However a V1 hit the hospital laundry and caused many casualties. This event is mentioned in a personal account by Simon Tobitt in WW2 Peoples War. The Gatehouse also received some bomb damage. The facility became St Bernard's Hospital, Southall in 1937.  Post war era  \\"E Block\\", St Bernard's Hospital Following the Second World War, new medicines were found to be effective in the treatment of many of the major mental illnesses, see Chlorpromazine. Following refinement and clinic trials they were introduced at the end of the 1950s and made a massive positive impact on the hospital. At last there was an effective treatment, and as a result the containment aspect of segregated patients within wards could for most wards be relaxed. As their illnesses responded to treatment patients recovered and started to be discharged. In the early 1960s the hospital accommodated circa 2,200 patients. Dr Max Meier Glatt, (26 January 1912 ‚Äì 14 May 2002) was one of the pioneers in the treatment of people with an addictive personality trait. Appointed as a consultant in 1958 he set up an alcohol dependency unit in a female ward. His approach of creating a \\"therapeutic community\\" with a 12-week inpatient stay to help patents come to terms with their problems and explore new methods of living in the future without their addiction was found to be a great success. In 1982 this facility was moved and became a drug and alcohol dependence unit; it moved again in 2000 and is now known as the Max Glatt Unit. It is currently run by the Central North West London Mental Health NHS Trust Substance Misuses Service. In the mid-1970s a UK Government, (Health Department) trial was announced to try to reduce the stigma of psychiatric hospitals. At Hanwell a new district general hospital was built in the grounds of the former asylum. The whole site was then named Ealing Hospital and comprised two wings: the \\"General Wing\\" for acute patients and \\"Ealing Hospital, St. Bernard's Wing\\" for psychiatric patients. In 1998, St. Bernard's Wing underwent a major refurbishment. It cost in excess of ¬£4.5 million and took roughly eight months. In 2007, the Orchard Centre was opened, as a medium secure psychiatric unit for women. The Department of Health had conducted a consultation and found that women experiencing mental health problems were poorly catered for.Department of Health (sept 2002) Women's Mental Health: Into the Mainstream.

At least one other episode uses a ward as a location where the three main characters visit a person supposedly in a general hospital ward. Some scenes of the BBC 1970s TV series Porridge starring Ronnie Barker was filmed at Hanwell. Some scenes of the 1989 Batman film starring (amongst others) Jack Nicholson as the Joker, were also filmed in empty wards at Hanwell (using K block). This went down especially well with the staff as an earlier film of Jack's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), set in an American psychiatric hospital, was at that time a favourite. Some scenes of Stephen Poliakoff's film She's Been Away (1989) were filmed at the hospital.

Phonetics Professor Henry Higgins, after successfully telling strangers where they were born by their accent, was jokingly told he came from Hanwell Insane Asylum.  Museum  Reverend H A Norris, (a former chaplain to the hospital) realized in the early 1980s that there were old records at hospital which were historically important and should join the others in the Greater London Council Records Library (now part of the National Archives). He feared these would be thrown out by staff, and volunteers formed the 'Museum Committee' to help. They recovered much of the hospital heritage. This also included mechanical restraints, ECT machines, and some of the old fixtures and fittings. The largest item by far was the last original 'seclusion room' with white stained leather-covered straw padding walls and floor. One of the books retrieved in the search by the museum committee was a discharge book, the first entry was within a few months of the asylum's opening and recorded the death of a young woman, it listed her reason for admission as being \\"Continually sneezing\\".

Built in 1901 as a trading post and converted into a residence for the Stranahans in 1906, the house is the oldest surviving structure in Broward County. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and today operates as a historic house museum. The House is open for guided tours at 1, 2, and 3 p.m. daily, and hosts special events throughout the year. The Stranahans 1893‚Äì1900 In 1893, at the age of 27 Frank Stranahan was hired by his cousin to manage his camp and ferry at Tarpon Bend located on the New River. He would quickly establish his own trading business with the Seminole Indians and gain the reputation of being a fair business man. Arriving via dugout canoes, large groups of Seminole families would camp at the post for days at a time. Eventually, in 1894 Frank would acquire ten acres of land for his own commercial interests and would move the trading post farther west along the river. This property became the focal point of the tiny New River settlement, of which Stranahan was now its postmaster. By 1899, the community had grown large enough to qualify for a teacher from the county board of education. Eighteen-year-old Ivy Julia Cromartie of Lemon city (what is now Little Haiti) was hired at $48 a month for the job. Community members built the one-room schoolhouse for Ivy and her nine students. Frank and Ivy would come to know one another during the five months Ivy lived and taught at the settlement. They would marry on August 16, 1900 at her family home, and as was customary for married women at the time, Ivy gave up her paid position. Though she gave up her paid position she did not, however, give up her teaching aspirations. She instead turned her attention to the Seminole children, offering informal lessons at the trading post that respected the Tribe's traditions. Her approach quelled skeptical tribal elders' fears and formed the basis for her lifelong friendship with the Seminole people. 1901‚Äì1910 Frank built the present day Stranahan House in 1901; the lower floor served as a trading post and the upper floor as a community hall. By 1906 Frank's business had expanded to include a general store and bank, he would also build a new building closer to the Railroad which had arrived in 1896. The old trading post was renovated as a result into a residence for the Stranahans. As Frank's businesses grew, so did the settlement. By 1910 the Census reports that there was 142 people living in the town. Frank and Ivy would take on many leadership roles in the social and civic life of their developing city, Ivy for instance would help found the Women's Civic improvement Association, later the Woman's club of Fort Lauderdale. Throughout the rest of her life Ivy would be involved with virtually every civic and social cause in the city. 1911‚Äì1929 Renamed Fort Lauderdale after the army forts that had been built during the Seminole Wars, the area was incorporated in 1911. Frank donated land for many public projects. With this new name Frank would end up selling the trading company in 1912 to focus on real estate and banking while Ivy would become president of the Florida Equal Suffrage Association in 1916. In 1924 due to her close relationship with the Seminoles, the federal government would seek out Ivy and ask for assistance in persuading the tribe to move to the reservation. She would be successful in her efforts. In 1926, Florida's land boom had collapsed. Frank suffered extreme economic reverses that were worsened over the next three years by two devastating hurricanes. Adding to Frank's distress was the knowledge that friends and associates who had invested with him were financially ruined as well. On May 22, 1929, deeply depressed and in ill health, Frank committed suicide drowning in the New River in front of his home. 1929‚Äì1971 Ivy carried on, making ends meet by renting out rooms of her home and eventually leasing the lower floor to a series of restaurants. She gradually returned to her civic activism. Among her many accomplishments she became a long-term member of the city's planning and zoning committee, successfully lobbied for the Homestead Exemption law, established the Friends of the Seminoles and founded Broward County chapters of the Red Cross and Campfire Girls. Ivy remained in her home until her death on August 30, 1971 at the age of 90. The house was left to the Seventh Day Adventist church, of which Ivy had been a member since 1915 it was purchased by the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society in 1975. The House 1901‚Äì1928 Frank built the two-story structure at its present site in 1901. The lower floor was used as the trading post, and the upper floor as a community hall. In 1906 Frank renovated the house and made it into their home. Bay windows were added, and gas lighting fixtures were likely installed at this time. The upper floor is believed to have remained an open space, accessible via the exterior stairs. In 1913 the house went through a second major renovation, the interior staircase was added and the house was wired for electricity. Water towers were installed in 1915 and it is believed that indoor plumbing was also installed at the same time. 1929‚Äìpresent Following Frank's suicide in 1929, Ivy continued to live in the house, but rented out rooms to visitors and later leased the lower floor to a series of restaurants, the last of which is known as the Pioneer House Restaurant. In 1971 Ivy died, but she left the home to the Seventh Day Adventist Church who registered the home with the National Register of Historic Homes in 1973. With the last restaurant closed, the Historical Society of Fort Lauderdale bought the house from the Seventh Day Adventists in 1979 and for the next four years a construction project began to restore the house to its 1915 appearance. In 1981 the House became its own corporation, with a separate board of trustees. The house opened to the public in the spring of 1984. Adjacent house is used as an administration building for Stranahan House.

Building The house was completed in 1935 in the locally popular Mediterranean Revival style. It is a one and two-story building with gable and hip roofing. The exterior walls are smooth stucco and the roof is Spanish tile. The one-story portion contains the public spaces and the two-story section has bedrooms and private baths. A garage is located behind the house. Hollywood architect Bayard Lukens a Pennsylvania native designed the house for the Hammerstein couple. Lukens also worked on many of Hollywood's churches and hotels. Bayard Lukens's private residence which he designed for himself is also on the list of historical sites in Hollywood and is located on the 1500-block of Adams Street in Hollywood. History In 1980 the owner of the home Clarence Hammerstein donated the house to the Hollywood Historical Society in honor of his late wife Vera Hammerstein. It was his wish that the home be operated as a museum and he contributed many artifacts of his life which form much of the display there. Items on display include Hammerstein's WWI Air Force uniform. The ashes of the home's owners Clarence and Vera Hammerstein reside at the house in two large urns. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 15, 2005. The home is operated as a historic house museum by the Hollywood Historical Society and contains artifacts of the Hammerstein's life. When Hammerstein died in 1987 at the age of 92 he donated 10% of his estate for the operation of the house as a museum.

The Thracians either had skillful craftsmen themselves, or access to Greek craftsmen. They made beautifully ornate golden and silver objects such as various kinds of vessels, rhytons, facial masks, pectorals, jewelry, weapons, etc. These show strong, and increasing, influence from the neighbouring cultures, especially the Greeks. They used to bury rich hoards of precious objects both to hide them in times of enemy invasions and unrest as well as for ritual purposes.

The Gardens themselves front onto Sheffield's gothic town hall, not to be confused with the Sheffield City Hall, a concert venue or the Sheffield Old Town Hall at Castle Market. History The Gardens were first laid out in 1938, following the demolition of St Paul's Church. Originally named St Paul's Gardens, they were immediately nicknamed the \\"Peace Gardens\\", marking the contemporary signing of the Munich Agreement.Ruth Harman and John Minnis, Pevsner Architectural Guides: Sheffield The Gardens were originally intended to be replaced by an extension to the Town Hall, but due to World War II, this was never built.The Peace Gardens , Sheffield City Council In 1985, the space was formally renamed the \\"Peace Gardens\\".Chen Chao, Sights in Sheffield: The Peace Gardens The Sheffield gardens are a fine example of the network of similar gardens created between the two world wars and presage later gardens and community spaces in London and other urban centres.

In 1997 work commenced to remove the former St Pauls graveyard, and the whole space was re-modelled. Water features and a central fountain were introduced, with the channels representing the rivers of Sheffield. The construction work was carried out by Tilbury Douglas Construction (now Interserve) under a Management form of Contract, with the design work carried out mainly by Sheffield City Council. The \\"topping out ceremony\\" was carried out by Prince Charles, and a plaque on Pinstone Street was unveiled to mark this event. The Peace Gardens were substantially completed by the end of 1998, then the Sheffield Millennium Galleries works commenced and the old egg-box council offices were then demolished. This allowed the remainder of the Peace Gardens to be completed in a second phase, which is also known as Millennium Square. Features One of the cascades It has fountains at the centre, and cascades around the outside. These are to represent the flowing molten steel, which made Sheffield famous, and also the water of Sheffield's rivers, the Sheaf, River Don, River Rivelin, River Loxley and Porter Brook, which were used to power the mills which drove Sheffield's industry. The site contains several memorials for citizens of Sheffield who served in wars, including in the Spanish Civil War and another plaque commemorating Sheffielders who gave their lives in all conflicts, including the Korean War.

Home boat builders often favor these synthetic sheet sails because the materials are inexpensive and easy to assemble into functional, durable sails.http://www.simplicityboats.com/simplicitysailrig.html  Construction method  The usual construction method involves * laying out the tarp material, * measuring the sail dimensions, * creating baselines from corner to corner, * placing double-faced carpet tape around the sail outline with sufficient rounding on selected edges to shape the sail, * placing a reinforcing rope along the inner edge of the tape, and * folding the taped overlap back over the rope to create the sail shape. The sail can be strengthened by adding reinforcing material to the corners and stitching around the edges of the sail. Adding grommets to the corners and edges will allow the sail to be attached to the mast and spars. Because these grommets are placed through doubled material and behind the reinforcing line inside the sail edge, the resulting attachment points have tremendous strength.  Grades and specifications  The most attractive, durable polytarp sails are usually made from a heavier white polytarp material. Generally, polysails are made from white ultraviolet-protected (UV-protected) material that is 12‚Äì16 mils (0.30‚Äì0.40 mm) thick (1 mil is .001 inches) and weighs about 6‚Äì8 ounces per square yard (200-270 grams per square meter) ‚Äîabout twice the weight and thickness of the common colored tarps which usually have no UV protection. The weave density of polyethylene strips in the inner layer determines the quality of the material. Common tarps have a weave of about 6' x 8' (1.8 x 2.4 m). \\"Canopy grade\\" white polytarps, on the other hand, have a weave of 12' x 14' (3.6 m x 4.3 m) or 14' x 14' (4.3 m x 4.3 m). Increasingly, white polytarp is used to construct mainsails, jibs, and mizzens, while the lightweight polytarp materials are reserved for making spinnakers. Polysail is the term given to any sail made of polytarp material and not just the white polytarp material.  Common sail types  Polytarp is used to construct nearly every type of sail. However, the material is best for traditional sail types such as sprits, lugs, gaffs, gunters, lateens, junk sails, and jib-headed sprits. They are not suitable for sails that depend upon being highly tensioned, such as the marconi or Bermuda types of triangular sails.

The project was previously given the marketing name Sevenstone, prior to Hammerson, the developer, being dropped from the project in July 2013 with Sheffield City Council seeking new developers. The first phase, consisting of restaurants, shops and offices is currently under construction and will open in 2020. The second phase will begin construction after and the full development is scheduled to be completed by 2022.  Overview  Located to the west of Pinstone Street, between Barkers Pool and Moorhead, the New Retail Quarter plans to cover a site in the heart of Sheffield and would involve a major re-design of this part of the city. The original ¬£600 million project, master-planned by architects BDP, planned to create a shopping and leisure environment in the heart of the city with a mixture of uses. of retail space was to be created, including a John Lewis department store, designed by multi- award-winning architects O'Donnell + Tuomey,O'Donnell + Tuomey a new Next store, and around 100 new shops. In addition, up to 200 residential flats, a health club and leisure facilities, and a ten-storey car park with 1,696 spaces were to be provided. The project was to relocate John Lewis and use the old store as a two-tiered shopping mall with covered streets. The proposal also included the pedestrianisation of Charter Row and the demolition of several buildings such as the Grosvenor House Hotel. Burgess Street would be realigned by redirecting it down towards the bottom of Barkers Pool as opposed to its current position parallel with Cambridge Street. Proposals are under review following the termination of agreement with Hammerson. However, with a pre-letting to HSBC of 14,000 m2 of new office, Sheffield City Council, acting as developer, approved the delivery of the first phase of the scheme. This phase includes 6,000 m2 of new retail space and the creation of a new public space over what was the Charter Square traffic roundabout. This first phase is due for completion in 2019.  History  Concept and original scheme Investigations into the rapid decline of Sheffield city centre from the mid-1980s led the Sheffield Development Corporation and Sheffield City Council to jointly commission Hillier Parker and the Oxford Institute of Retail Management to undertake a study of the region in 1994, and to recommend a strategy for regeneration of the city centre. The study noted the decline in status of the city centre and recommended a long-term strategy for the unification of The Moor and Fargate through a major retail development. This concept was developed and in 2000 the New Retail Quarter site was identified by a City Centre Masterplan, commissioned by Sheffield 1, the City's urban regeneration company. In 2001, Hammerson was selected as preferred developer through conducted jointly by Sheffield 1 and the Council. Hammerson submitted an Outline Planning Application in October 2005, seeking permission for a mixed use development consisting of refurbishment of use of existing buildings and erection of buildings for retail, housing, a night club, a health and fitness club, and multi-storey car parking. Amended planning applications were submitted in May and July 2006. Enabling works (that is, providing the gas, water, electrical and telephone infrastructure) began in March 2006 on the roads surrounding the new site, including Division Street, Moore Street, Charter Row and others.Enabling Works The Outline Planning Application was approved by the Council in August 2006. The Secretary of State confirmed by letters dated 25 September 2006 and 9 October 2006 that he did not wish to intervene, and that the decision as to whether to grant outline planning permission and the associated listed building consents would therefore remain with the Council. The Section 106 Agreement was completed in November 2006 and outline planning permission and associated listed building consents were issued that month. In October 2007, developers Hammerson unveiled the official marketing name for the New Retail Quarter as Sevenstone. The branding was welcomed by business and political leaders in Sheffield. In March 2008, a three-day public exhibition displayed the plans for Sevenstone in Sheffield City Centre. Local press described the reactions of Sheffield citizens to the plans as 'mixed'. Collapse of original scheme On 29 January 2009, the Sheffield Star reported that the project had been put on hold indefinitely, based on an interview with the city's regeneration company who retracted the statement the following day. Despite the uncertainty, the demolition of the Wellington Street fire station, began in December 2009, with agreement that the site would be used as a temporary car park until work begun. On 17 June 2010, the Coalition Government, just weeks after its formation, announced the suspension of ¬£12 million of central funding toward the project. Nevertheless, on 15 March 2011, Sheffield City Council announced that it was taking out a ¬£10 million loan to kick-start the stalled development. The money plus a further ¬£10 million contributed by the developers Hammerson would be used to part finance the compulsory purchase of all the empty shops and land needed to build the scheme. As a result, the Sevenstone scheme was expected to start in late 2013 or early 2014. BBC News (15/3/11). However, the project continued to stall and in March 2012, John Lewis announced that it was no longer seeking to move from its current store into the Sevenstone development. Sheffield City Council provided an update in March 2013 claiming: > Sheffield City Council, Hammerson plc and John Lewis Partnership remain > committed to delivering on the city‚Äôs Sevenstone retail project. The three > partners have accelerated discussions by which the Sevenstone retail led > project can be brought forward for delivery in Sheffield City Centre. All > parties have been focused on a new scheme layout and have agreed the > location of a new anchor John Lewis store. It is anticipated that the new > scheme will include up to 700,000 sq ft of retail with extensive food and > entertainment venues along with a multi storey car park and high quality > public realm throughout. Positive negotiations are ongoing for a revised > scheme layout. It is still hoped to start on site in 2014/15. On 29 July 2013 it was announced that developer Hammerson had been axed by Sheffield City Council. 2014 revised scheme On 10 October 2013, Sheffield City Council announced that it had begun the formal process to \\"end their relationship with Hammerson\\". However, the statement also claimed that: > The Council aims to deliver a New Retail Quarter that will fundamentally > improve the retail offer in the City Centre, by providing modern flexible > retail spaces and attracting quality fashion retailers. This will make a > significant step change and will boost Sheffield City Centre‚Äôs status back > up the retail ranking index. The statement also claimed that the project would be ready to take to the market place in spring 2014 and was on programme with a target for completion during 2018/19. In March 2015, more detailed plans of the Sheffield Retail Quarter development designed by Leonard Design Architects were revealed, with a focus on introducing ‚Äúaspirational and contemporary retailers‚Äù along Cross Burgess Street and Pinstone Street, concentrated around an anchor store. The new schedule aims to have the quarter 80% complete by 2019, with the end objective of having all phases completed by 2021.

This article covers the situation in major countries, provides a historical perspective, and reviews the main arguments made for and against women in combat. History American Civil War veteran, Cathy Williams For most of human history, people serving in combat were overwhelmingly male. In a few cases, however, individual women have been recorded as serving in combat roles or in leadership roles as queens (such as Queen Boudica, who led the Britons against Rome; Joan of Arc is the most famous example).Bernard Cook, Women and War: Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present (2006) During the First World War, first ever woman officer was enlisted for military service - .

Milit√§r und Gesellschaft in der Habsburgermonarchie (1800 bis 1918) (Reihe Frieden und Krieg 18) (2011) After the February Revolution, Russia used one all-female combat unit. Thousands of women served in combat and rearguard roles in the Spanish Civil War. In the Second World War, hundreds of thousands of British and German women served in combat roles in anti-aircraft units, where they shot down thousands of enemy aircraft. They were widely accepted because they were not at risk of capture.D'Ann Campbell, \\"Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union\\", Journal of Military History 57 (April 1993), 301-323 In the Soviet Union, there was large-scale use of women near the front as medical staff and political officers. The Soviets also set up all-female sniper units and combat fighter planes.Anna Krylova, Soviet Women in Combat: A History of Violence on the Eastern Front (2010)K. Jean Cottam, \\"Soviet Women in Combat in World War II: The Ground Forces and the Navy,\\" International Journal of Women's Studies (1980) 3#4 pp 345-357 A few women also played combat roles in resistance movements in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.K. Jean Cottam, \\"Soviet Women in Combat in World War II: The Rear Services, Resistance behind Enemy Lines and Military Political Workers,\\" International Journal of Women's Studies (1982) 5#4 pp 363-378 Specific countries Australia Female Australian soldiers in Afghanistan The Australian military began a five-year plan to open combat roles to women in 2011. Front line combat roles opened in January 2013. The positions women will now be able to fill are: Navy Ordnance disposal divers, airfield and ground defense guards, infantry, artillery and armored units. Australia is one of nineteen countries which includes women in its direct combat forces. During Australia's participation in World War II, the Australian military created a sub-branch of each of its armed forces specifically for females. In 1977, the Royal Australian Air Force was the first Australian service to fully integrate women. The Australian Army was next, in 1979, followed by the Royal Australian Navy in 1985. Servicewomen's combat restrictions were eased beginning in 1990. In 2011, Defence Minister Stephen Smith announced that the Australian Cabinet had lifted all gender-based restrictions for women in combat. Canada Women have been an important component of the military of Canada. Though, it was not until Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedom was enacted in 1982, that the Armed Forces were required to consider the equality of women in the services and to permit them into all military roles. It took exactly 7 years, until 1989, for all combat roles to finally be opened to women in Canada. That same year, in 1989, the Canadian Human Rights Commission gave the Canadian Forces 10 years to meet a specific quota for women employed in the combat trades. Although the Canadian Human Rights Commission had an exception of excluding women of serving on submarines, it was eventually lifted by the Royal Canadian Navy on March 8, 2000 and roles opened in 2001. In 1998, the Canadian Forces embarked on a series of initiatives aimed at recruiting more women into the combat trades. While attrition remains an issue, with significantly higher rates of women leaving their military careers than men, the introduction of women into the combat arms has increased the potential recruiting pool by about 100%. Jennie Carignan is the world's first-ever female to become a combat general. June 2016, she has been promoted to the highest rank achieved by a Canadian woman from the combat armed trade. Although there were other Canadian female generals in the past, the roles were limited to non-combat disciplines such as intelligence, medicine, combat support or administration. For a long time it has been the support, and never the combat itself. The military says 2.4% of personnel in combat units are women ‚Äî 145 officers and 209 enlisted soldiers. Overall, 9,348 women serve in the Canadian Armed Forces, 14% of all personnel. She is currently on a mission to bring equal opportunities to the force by recruiting more women into combat roles and creating a better environment for women to pursue their careers in the military. Denmark In 1988, Denmark created a policy of \\"total inclusion\\". They proposed \\"combat trials\\" which they explored how women fight on the front lines. A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men. All positions in military are open to women, although as yet no women have fulfilled the physical requirements of the Special Operations Forces. Finland Men are required to enlist whereas for women it is voluntary. If women do choose to enlist they are allowed to train for combat roles. There are no restrictions for women in the Finnish combat. France Women comprise nearly one-fifth of the military in France. Women can serve in most areas of the military except riot control. They have been allowed in submarines, including nuclear submarines, since 2014.AFP, Baptism At Sea For First Women To Join France's Nuclear Subs, NDTV, July 19, 2018 Women are allowed to serve in combat infantry. 1.7% of combat infantry are women. Germany In 2001, Germany opened all combat units to women. This greatly increased recruitment for female soldiers. Since 2001, the number of women in the German Armed Forces has tripled. By 2009, 800 female soldiers were serving in combat units. India India began recruiting women to non-medical positions in the armed forces in 1992..... In 2007 on 19 January, the United Nations first all female peacekeeping force made up of 105 Indian policewomen was deployed to Liberia. In 2014, India's army had 3 per cent women, the Navy 2.8 per cent and the Air Force performed best with 8.5 per cent women. In 2015 India opened new combat air force roles for women as fighter pilots, adding to their role as helicopter pilots in the Indian Air Force.\\"India paves way for women in military combat roles\\" Channel NewsAsia 24 Oct 2015 In 2020, the Supreme Court of India has ordered the Centre to ensure that women officers are given a permanent commission (PC) in the Army while adding that the officers will now be eligible for command posting. The court stated that all terms of appointments of women officers shall be the same as their male counterparts.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court- clears-permanent-commission-for-women-officers-in-army-1647196-2020-02-17 Israel According to the Israel Defense Forces, 535 female Israeli soldiers had been killed in combat operations between the period 1962-2016 (this figure does not include the dozens of female soldiers killed in Israeli service prior to 1962). In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in \\"combat-support\\".Gaza: It's a Man's War The Atlantic, 7 Aug 2014 In spite of this, women in ground combat positions are typically only deployed to guard duties in relatively quiet areas. Women are excluded from frontline infantry brigades which are actively deployed into combat zones. Female infantry combatants are limited to three mixed-gender infantry battalions (the Caracal, Lions of Jordan, and Bardelas battalions) which are deployed along Israel's border with Egypt, the Jordan Valley, and the Arava region to guard against infiltration and smuggling attempts, the IDF's Oketz K9 unit, the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps, and the Search and Rescue Unit of the Home Front Command. Although they are expected to respond if a combat situation breaks out during operational activity, female infantry soldiers are not actively deployed into war zones. They are also subjected to lighter physical training standards than male soldiers. Female tank crews are limited to the Border Defense Array, in tanks guarding the borders with Egypt and Jordan, and are not part of regular armored units that are deployed into war zones. Their sole expectation as combatants is to return fire from a stationary position if engaged.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5047996,00.htmlhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/reversing- course-idf-restarts-all-female-tank-crew-trial- program/https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/02/20/idfs-pioneering-all-women-tank- crews-to-provide-protection-of-israels-south/ The Israeli Air Force allows women to serve as pilots alongside men in all roles since the ban on women serving as pilots was lifted in 1995, though the IAF's combat pilots are still overwhelmingly male. By 2014, 38 women had been accepted as pilots into the Israeli Air Force since 1995, including 3 combat pilots and 16 combat navigators. Kurdistan YPJ, alongside their male YPG counterparts Women have notably been incorporated in Kurdish militias fighting ISIL, including in combat roles, a preeminent example being Women's Protection Units. New Zealand New Zealand has no restrictions on roles for women in its defence force. They are able to serve in the Special Air Service, infantry, armour and artillery. This came into effect in 2001 by subordinate legislation.  Norway  In 1985, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its submarines. The first female commander of a Norwegian submarine was Solveig Krey in 1995. Norway was, along with Israel, first to allow women to serve in all combat roles in the military in 1988. In 2015, Norway made women eligible for compulsory military service. Pakistan Women in the Pakistan Armed Forces are the female soldiers who serve in the Pakistan Armed Forces.[1][2] Women have been taking part in Pakistani military since 1947 after the establishment of Pakistan. There are currently around 4,000 women who are serving in the Pakistan Armed Forces.[3][4] In 2006, the first women fighter pilots batch joined the combat aerial mission command of PAF[5][6]  Sri Lanka  Female personnel of all three services play an active part in ongoing operations. However, there are certain limitations in 'direct combat' duties such as special forces, pilot branch, naval fast attack squadrons.  Sweden  Women have been able to serve in most military positions, including combat since 1983. The exception was tactical air service (pilot) and various submarine positions, which opened up in 1989. Since 2018, Sweden also conscripts women on the same (mandatory) terms as men. As of 2018, women constituted 15% of the selected conscripts and 7% of the professional military officers (however numbers were much higher on temporary positions).  Turkey  Sabiha G√∂k√ßen with her Breguet 19. Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country. Nene Hatun, whose monument has been erected in Erzurum, fought during the Ottoman-Russian War. Turkish women also took main roles in combat in WWI and the Independence War. Sabiha G√∂k√ßen was the first Turkish female combat pilot, having flown 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. As of 2005, there are 1245 female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces. Women officers serve in all branches except armor, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias. United Kingdom In July 2016 all exclusions on women serving in Ground Close Combat (GCC) roles were lifted. All roles in the King's Royal Hussars, the Royal Tank Regiment, and all Army Reserve Royal Armoured Corps units have been opened to women, and women were permitted to join the rest of the previously closed GCC roles in the Royal Armoured Corps, British Army Infantry, Royal Marines and the RAF Regiment by the end of 2018. It's important to note, however, that even though GCC roles were closed to women until 2016, women have been previously on the \\"front line\\" and exposed to combat in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through other roles, such as all roles in the Royal Artillery, which despite being one of the combat arms is not classed as a GCC role. Women were permitted to serve in Fire Support Teams and on 105mm L118 Light Gun crews. Women were also permitted to apply to join the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, which is one of the major components of the UK Special Forces alongside the Special Air Service, Special Boat Service and Special Forces Support Group. Women also served as combat medics attached to Army Infantry, Royal Marines and other GCC units. Some were awarded the prestigious Military Cross for bravery under fire. Six British women in the Iraq War, and three in the Afghanistan War were killed in action. United States A female US Navy engineer on guard duty during a deployment to Afghanistan in 2009 As far back as the Revolutionary War, when Molly Pitcher took over a cannon after her husband fell in the field, where she was delivering water (in pitchers), women have at times been forced into combat, though until recently they have been formally banned from choosing to do so intentionally. In WWI and WWII women served in numerous roles such as the Army Nurse Corps, and the Women's Army Corps (WAC). They carried out various roles such as clerical work, mechanical work, photo analysis, and sheet metal working; in some cases they were utilized as test pilots for fighter planes as WASPS. In 1979 enlistment qualifications became the same for men and women. While women were able to enlist, they were prohibited from direct combat roles or assignments. In 1994 the Department of Defense officially banned women from serving in combat. The United States has more women in its military than any other nation. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 was a pivotal point for women in the Military. As the Army's mission changed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the roles of women also changed in the ranks. In 2016, women had the equal right to choose any military occupational specialty such as ground units that were not authorized before. On January 24, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta removed the military's ban on women serving in combat. Implementation of these rules is ongoing. There is some speculation that this could lead to women having to register with the Selective Service System. On November 21, 2013, the first three women to ever complete the United States Marine Corps‚Äô Infantry Training Battalion course graduated from the United States Marine Corps School of Infantry in Camp Geiger, North Carolina.After first co-ed infantry class, new perspectives on women in combat accessed November 25, 2013 However, these three female graduates will still not be allowed to serve in infantry units until further studies can demonstrate they are physically capable of doing so.Three women pass Marine ‚Äògrunt‚Äô test, but Corps holds off on letting them in infantry Craig Whitlock, Washington Post, published November 20, 2013, accessed November 24, 2013 However it was later reported on January 3, 2017 that three women who graduated became the first join a Marine combat battalion that would serve as a rifleman, machine gunner and mortar Marine in the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines. In April 2015, a -year period in which the tough Marine Corps' Infantry Officer Course became gender-integrated for research ended without a single female graduate.Marines' combat test period ends without female grad accessed January 6, 2016 The final two participants in the Marines' experiment with training women for ground combat started and failed the IOC on April 2. Both were dropped that same day during the grueling initial Combat Endurance Test.Last IOC in Marine infantry experiment drops female officers accessed January 6, 2016 Army Ranger Battalions and Navy SEAL units planned to open positions to women by 2015 and 2016, respectively. In August 2015, Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became the first two women to graduate from the U.S. Army Ranger School, though at the time, women were not eligible to enlist in the 75th Ranger Regiment. In 2016, Griest became the first female infantry officer in the US Army when the Army approved her request to transfer there from a military police unit. In December 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter stated that starting in 2016 all combat jobs would open to women. The decision was not supported by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford of the Marine Corps, who wanted to keep certain direct combat positions such as infantry and machine gunner closed to women. One significant female contribution was recognized on June 16, 2005, when Sgt. Ann Hester was awarded the Silver Star for her actions during a firefight that took place outside Baghdad. This was the first Silver Star in U.S. military history awarded to a woman soldier, not tied to Army medicine. In March 2016, Ash Carter approved final plans from military service branches and the U.S. Special Operations Command to open all combat jobs to women, and authorized the military to begin integrating female combat soldiers \\"right away.\\" On October 26, 2016, ten women became the first female graduates from the United States Army's Infantry Basic Officer Leader's Course at Fort Benning, Georgia. In December 2016, an anonymous woman passed the RASP II selection course for the 75th Ranger Regiment. She was the first woman to graduate from a special operations unit selection course. On September 25, 2017, an anonymous woman, later revealed to be 1st Lt. Marina Hierl, became the first to complete the United States Marine Corps' Infantry Officer Course at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia and become the first female Marine infantry officer. Issues The following is a list of issues at the center of the debate whether or not gender integration lends to combat effectiveness. The debate centers more on the physical characteristics of individual women rather than the question of their overall contributions to teams and units. A detailed study was also done by Global Policy on the ongoing debate, which categorizes the following criticisms. Physical concerns The Center for Military Readiness, an organization that seeks to limit women's participation in the military, stated that ‚ÄúFemale soldiers [are], on average, shorter and smaller than men, with 45-50% less upper body strength and 25-30% less aerobic capacity, which is essential for endurance‚Äù. Motherhood accounts for 58% of hospitalizations among active-duty female troops. A 2014-2015 experiment by the Marine Corps with a gender-integrated combat unit found that women were twice as likely to suffer injuries significant enough to remove them from duty, and that women's shooting accuracy was much less than that of men in simulated combat situations. Female soldiers were also found to have lower performance in the basic combat tasks like negotiating obstacles and removing wounded troops from the battlefield.U.S. Marines study: Women in combat injured more often than men UPI accessed January 6, 2016 The female skeletal system is less dense, and more prone to breakages. There is also a concern that, in aviation, the female body is not as adept at handling the increased g-forces experienced by combat pilots. Furthermore, health issues regarding women are argued as the reason that some submarine services avoid accepting women, although mixed-gender accommodations in a small space is also an issue, as is explained in more depth below. In the Austrian Armed Forces and almost all NATO countries, significantly lower physical performance requirements for entrance and subsequent tests apply to female soldiers in determining fitness for service. The Swiss Armed Forces abolished this advantage for female soldiers in 2007. Social concerns The purported disruption of a combat unit's morale is cited as another reason for women to be banned from front-line combat situations. There is a secondary concern that romantic relationships between men and women on the front lines could disrupt a unit's fighting capability and a fear that a high number of women would deliberately become pregnant in order to escape combat duties. To compare, the U.S. military is substantially staffed by young women. The volunteer military has turned out to be \\"family friendly\\". Marriage is frequent and fertility levels are increasing to this day in the military. A third argument against the inclusion of women in combat units is that placing women in combat where they are at risk of being captured and tortured and possibly sexually assaulted is unacceptable. Rhonda Cornum, then a Major and flight surgeon, and now a Brigadier General and Command Surgeon for United States Army Forces Command, was an Iraqi prisoner of war in 1991. At the time, she was asked not to mention that she had been molested while in captivity. Finally, there is the argument that by not incorporating women into combat, the American government is failing to tap into another source of soldiers for military combat operations. This argument claims that the government is creating a military that treats women as second-class citizens and not equals of men.Congresswoman Louise M. Slaughter: Remarks on Women in Combat Tactical concerns Lieutenant colonel Dave Grossman's book On Killing briefly mentions that female soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been officially prohibited from serving in close combat military operations since 1948. The reason for removing female soldiers from the front lines was due less to the performance of female soldiers, and more due to the behavior of the male infantrymen after witnessing a woman wounded. The IDF saw a complete loss of control over soldiers who apparently experienced an instinctual protective aggression that was uncontrollable, severely degrading the unit's combat effectiveness. However, in 2001, subsequent to the publication of Grossman's book, women did begin serving in IDF combat units on an experimental basis. There is now a male-female infantry battalion, the Caracal Battalion. In a similar vein, Melody Kemp mentions that the Australian military has also voiced similar concerns saying their soldiers \\"are reluctant to take women on reconnaissance or special operations, as they fear that in the case of combat or discovery, their priority will be to save the women and not to complete the mission. Thus while men might be able to be programmed to kill, it is not as easy to program men to neglect women.\\" Recent studies from Harvard Business School and MIT have shown that group intelligence of an organization rises when women are on teams. Women tend to bring a level of sensitivity and the ability to read emotions of other people. In today's battlefield experiences, social sensitivity is a very much needed skill for military professionals. Having women in the military would dramatically increase the ability to extract critical intelligence. This could possibly be the difference between a mission's success or failure. Grossman also notes that Islamic militants rarely, if ever, surrender to female soldiers. Similarly, Iraqi and Afghan civilians are often not intimidated by female soldiers. Combat support In modern warfare, however, where \\"winning minds\\" and gaining intelligence can prove more important at times than enemy casualties, having female soldiers serving alongside a combat unit may have some advantages. For example, the use of female US military personnel attached to combat units specifically for the purpose of performing culturally sensitive searches such as in the USMC Lioness program which used female Marines to search females at checkpoints both on the Iraq-Syrian border and inside urban areas. Another example is the US Army Cultural Support Teams (CSTs). that accompany special operations teams and work alongside them providing access to the needs of and information and from local community women in communities where contact between male soldiers and civilian women is culturally fraught. Women made a huge impact in 2010 when the United States Army began utilizing Female Engagement Teams in Afghanistan. The main purpose for these teams was to engage more female populations where such combat was not possible by male service members. These teams perform a number of duties, including intelligence gathering, relationship building, and humanitarian efforts. There is evidence showing women in both Iraq and Afghanistan have had considerable success in acquiring intelligence from children and women. In these cases the US military adheres to local customs for the purposes of counterinsurgency, whereby males are not permitted to talk to women who are not in their family or are not married to them.

It is native to parts of eastern North America and present to some extent in the wild in much of the eastern, southeastern and midwestern United States as well as in the Canadian Province of Ontario. It is most common in the Ozarks and in the Mississippi/Ohio Valley. Its habitats include dry open woods, prairies and barrens. Taxonomy 'Echinacea' is derived from Greek, meaning ‚Äòspiny one‚Äô, in reference to the spiny sea urchins 'ŒµœáŒØŒΩŒøŒπ'. 'Purpurea' means 'reddish-purple'. Originally named Rudbeckia purpurea by Linnaeus in 1753 in Species plantarum 6 , it was reclassified in 1794 by Conrad Moench, in a new genus named Echinacea purpurea (L.). In 1818, Thomas Nuttall describes a new variety that he named Rudbeckia purpurea var. serotina. Just two decades later, De Candolle raises him to the rank of species of the other genus Echinacea serotina (Nutt.) DC. (1836). In 2002, Binns et al. discovered a misapplication of the name Echinacea purpurea for the taxon correctly named Echinacea serotina in 1836. The authors proposed to retain the names not to cause confusion among gardeners and herbalists. Description Echinacea purpurea is an herbaceous perennial up to tall by wide at maturity. Depending on the climate, it blooms throughout summer into autumn. Its cone-shaped flowering heads are usually, but not always, purple in the wild. Its individual flowers (florets) within the flower head are hermaphroditic, having both male and female organs in each flower. It is pollinated by butterflies and bees. The alternate leaves, borne by a petiole from 0 to 17 cm, are oval to lanceolate, 5-30 x 5-12 cm; the margin is tightened to toothed. The inflorescence is a capitulum, 7 to 15 cm in diameter, formed by a prominent domed central protuberance consisting of multiple small yellow florets. These are surrounded by a ring of pink or purple ligulate florets. The tubular florets are hermaphrodite while the ligular florets are sterile. The involucral bracts are linear to lanceolate. The plant prefers well-drained soils in full sun. The fruit is an achene, sought after by birds. Cultivation Plants raised outdoors Echinacea purpurea is grown as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It is ideal for curbs, walkways or beds. The flowers can also go into the composition of fresh bouquets. Numerous cultivars have been developed for flower quality and plant form. The plant grows in sun or light shade. It thrives in either dry or moist soil and can tolerate drought once established. The cultivars 'Ruby Giant' and ='Elbrook' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Propagation Echinacea purpurea is propagated either vegetatively or from seeds. Useful vegetative techniques include division, root cuttings, and basal cuttings. Clumps can be divided, or broken into smaller bunches, which is normally done in the spring or autumn. Cuttings made from roots that are \\"pencil-sized\\" will develop into plants when started in late autumn or early winter. Cuttings of basal shoots in the spring may be rooted when treated with rooting hormones, such as IBA at 1000 ppm. Seed germination occurs best with daily temperature fluctuations or after stratification,USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Eastern Purple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) which help to end dormancy. Seeds may be started indoors in advance of the growing season or outdoors after the growing season has started. Ecology Slugs and Rabbits will also eat the foliage when young, or shortly after emerging in the spring. Additionally, roots can be damaged and eaten by gophers. Chemistry Echinacea purpurea contains alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, polysaccharides, and glycoproteins with purported stimulating effects on the immune system. Nicotiflorin is the dominant flavonoid in E. purpurea, followed by the flavonoid rutin. As medicine Native Americans used the plant to treat many ailments, including wounds, burns, insect bites, toothaches, throat infections, pain, cough, stomach cramps, and snake bites. Research has shown how the purple coneflower stimulates the immune system, leading to renewed interest for treating immunodeficiencies, lowering the glycemia and \\"boosting\\" healthy immune systems during periods of stress or pandemic, anxiety, and inflammation. Echinacea purpurea is used in pharmaceutics because of its ability to mobilize leukocytes, activate phagocytosis, and stimulate fibroblast formation. It has been implemented in chemotherapy medications and is one of the most widely medically cultivated species of its genus.

However, a more suitable site for the mission was found about 50 kilometers farther north, at Cabujakaamung, following seven months of mission activity at Calamaju√©. Calamaju√© also served as a travel station on the Camino Real Misionero between San Borja and Santa Mar√≠a. Adobe ruins and rock corrals now mark the location. References * Vernon, Edward W. 2002.

The MISTIC, or Michigan State Integral Computer, was the first computer system at Michigan State University and was built by its students, faculty and staff in 1957. Powered by vacuum tubes, its design was based on ILLIAC, the supercomputer built at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, a descendant of the IAS architecture developed by John von Neumann. History The interest in developing a computer system at Michigan State University (MSU) began several years before MISTIC was conceived. In 1954 when MSU was known as Michigan State College (MSC), Professor J. Sutherland Frame of the Mathematics department sent a proposal for a computer donation from the United States Army Aberdeen Proving Ground. Unfortunately, a federal agency won that donation and the computing vision was not realized at that time. However, all hope was not lost. In April 1955, Dr. Frame, Dr. Kenneth Arnold, Dr. John Hofman, Francis Martin, Dr. George Swenson Jr., Dr. Lloyd Turk, and Dr. Charles Wells traveled to the University of Illinois to examine the ILLIAC, one of the few university-operated digital computers of its time. When they returned to MSU they made a recommendation to the university to build its own computing facility. The Board of Trustees and MSU president John A. Hannah quickly approved it. John Ryder, MSC's Dean of Engineering, former head of Electrical Engineering at University of Illinois had assisted in the construction of the ILLIAC, estimated that MSC could build their ILLIAC equivalent (including hiring two engineers) for $150,000. The MISTIC Interests in designing MISTIC as the ILLIAC computer model at MSU was gaining attention from wide areas of academia within the United States, even as far as Iowa State University where electrical engineering Professor Dr. Lawrence Wayne Von Tersch originated. He came to MSU in March 1956 with the interest in the ILLIAC platform due to its large amount of statistical software available on paper tape. After a summer of study of the ILLIAC in Illinois, Dr. Von Tersch and three of his graduate students began building MISTIC in the fall of 1956. Both ILLIAC and MISTIC were based on the Institute for Advanced Study's (IAS) computer, known for its revolutionary storage of data and instructions in the same memory. MISTIC and IAS consisted of five sections‚Äîinput, memory, arithmetic processing, control, and output‚Äîsetting the standard for at least twelve other computers later built. MISTIC was built on the fifth floor, Room 500, of the Electrical Engineering Building, which today is the MSU Computer Center. Completed in the fall of 1957, the MISTIC weighed about one ton, filled the whole room, and was capable of storing 1,024 40-bit words (5 KB) in memory. Its anticipation sparked the establishment of the MSU Computer Laboratory in 1956 under the direction of Dr. Von Tersch. It was used in MSU's first computer course taught by computer coding professor Dr. Gerard Weeg. Departments from all over the MSU campus utilized the MISTIC for a myriad of courses and activities. The post-MISTIC era MISTIC was the introduction of digital computing to the university, first step in the vast unexplored field. Computers with higher computational power followed within a few years. The vacuum-tube-based MISTIC was replaced by transistor-based Control Data Corporation (CDC) 3600 in 1963, CDC 6500 in 1968, CDC Cyber 170-750 in 1979 and many more down the years. MISTIC proved to be the cornerstone that changed the way faculty and students perceived computation. The university has owned many mainframes since MISTIC, but none has ever had as magical and inspirational effect as the one that was built on the fifth floor of the Electrical Engineering building, now the Computer Center.

Life  Coleman first went to Rome in 1831, to study the paintings of Michelangelo and Raphael. He became permanently resident there in 1835, and on 21 June 1836 married Fortunata Segadori (or Segatori) from Subiaco, who, along with Vittoria Caldoni of Albano, was one of the most famous Roman models of the time. Segadori had sat for August Riedel; a portrait of her by Johann Heinrich Richter is in the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen. The couple had eight children; their son Enrico Coleman (1846‚Äì1911), was also a landscape painter, in oils and watercolour, as was the younger and less well-known Francesco Coleman. The Colemans' first address was 25 via Zucchelli. In 1869 the family moved to 16 via Zucchelli, and for the first time Coleman set up a separate studio, at 33 via Margutta, possibly with the intention of providing space for his two painter sons.  Works  Four of Charles Coleman's paintings, dated from 1845 to 1847 and all featuring buffaloes, are listed in the catalogue of the collection of Beriah Botfield. From 1848 to 1850 he made etchings of scenes and animals in the Campagna Romana, and these were published in 1850. He was dismissive of academic teaching, believing that observation from nature was the best education for an artist. He exhibited five times at the Royal Academy of London, for the last time in 1869. Coleman remained largely unknown in his native country but became a major influence on the Italian landscape painter Nino Costa, whom he met in the Campagna in the early 1850s. Coleman was considered the founder of the \\"Campagna Romana\\" school of painting in Italy. Charles Coleman died in Rome in 1874.

It is a 10-day festival, starting with nine nights called Navaratri and the last day being Vijayadashami. The festival is observed on the tenth day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October. The Hindu festival of Dasara, Navratri and Vijayadashami celebrates the victory of good over evil. It was the day in the Hindu legends when Goddess Chamundeshwari (Durga) killed the demon Mahishasura. Mahishasura is the demon whose slaying by the Goddess gave the city the name Mysuru. The Mysuru tradition celebrates the warriors and the state fighting for the good during this festival, ritually worshipping and displaying the state sword, weapons, elephants, horses along with Hindu Devi goddess in her warrior form (predominantly) as well as the Vishnu avatar Rama. The ceremonies and a major procession is traditionally presided by the king of Mysuru. The city of Mysuru has a long tradition of celebrating the Dasara festival with grandeur and pomp to mark the festival. The Dasara festival in Mysuru completed 409th anniversary in the year 2019, while evidence suggests the festivities were observed in Karnataka state by the Vijayanagara Empire kings in the 15th century.Dasara of Mysore , All India Radio, Government of India History The Dasara festivities began with the Vijayanagar kings as early as the 15th Century. The festival played a historical role in the 14th- century Vijayanagara Empire, where it was called Mahanavami and the festivities are shown in the relief artwork of the outer wall of the Hazara Rama temple of Hampi. The Italian traveller Niccol√≤ de' Conti described the festival's intensity and importance as a grandeur religious and martial event with royal support. The event revered Durga as the warrior goddess (some texts refer to her as Chamundeshwari). The celebrations hosted athletic competitions, singing and dancing, fireworks, a pageantry military parade and charitable giving to the public. After the fall of the Vijayanagar to Deccan Sultanates, these Hindu celebrations came to an end under Muslim rulers. The Wodeyars of Mysore formed a kingdom in Southern parts of the Vijayanagara Empire and continued the Mahanavami (Dasara) festival celebration, a tradition started initially by Raja Wodeyar I (1578-1617 CE) in mid September 1610 at Srirangapatna. Festivities A lit up Mysore Palace, the epicenter of all Dasara festivities held in Mysore The festivities included a special durbar (royal assembly). It was during the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III in the year 1805, when the king started the tradition of having a special durbar in the Mysore Palace during Dasara; which was attended by members of the royal family, special invitees, officials and the masses. After the death of Srikanta Wadiyar in December 2013, this tradition has been continued by placing the \\"Pattada Katti\\" (royal sword) on the golden throne. The ninth day of Dasara called as Mahanavami is also an auspicious day on which the royal sword is worshipped and is taken on a procession involving elephants, camels and horses.Detailed account of the Mysore Dasara festival is provided by Lightings in Mysore Palace The main attraction of the ten-day Mysore Dasara festival is the Mysore Palace which is lighted daily with nearly 100,000 light bulbs from 7 pm to 10 pm on all days of the festival. Various cultural and religious programs highlighting the dance, music and culture of the State of Karnataka are performed in front of the illuminated Palace. Procession On Vijayadashami, the traditional Dasara procession (locally known as Jumboo Savari) is held on the streets of Mysore city. The main attraction of this procession is the idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari which is placed on a golden mantapa (which is around 750 kilograms of gold) on the top of a decorated elephant. This idol is worshipped by the royal couple and other invitees before it is taken around in the procession. Colourful tableaux, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels form a part of the procession which starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantap where the banni tree (Prosopis spicigera) is worshipped. According to a legend of the Mahabharata, banni tree was used by the Pandavas to hide their weapons during their one-year period of Agnatavasa (living life incognito). Before undertaking any warfare, the kings traditionally worshipped this tree to help them emerge victorious in the war. The Dasara festivities would culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with an event held in the grounds at Bannimantap called as Panjina Kavayatthu (torch- light parade). In Mysore, India, the Vijayadashami Elephant procession during Mysore Dasara is called Jumbo Savari (from the British during their control of Mysore State). The original name to this procession is Jumbi Savari (\\"going to the Shami (Banni) tree\\"). Now Goddess Chamundeshwari is taken in procession on an Elephant. But the \\"Jumbo\\" name is still intact. After the Jamboo Savari, a torchlight parade takes place in the evening at the Bannimantap Parade Grounds. Exhibition Another major attraction during Dasara is the Dasara exhibition which is held in the exhibition grounds opposite to the Mysore Palace. The exhibition was started by the Maharaja of Mysore Chamaraja Wodeyar X in 1880 with the sole aim of introducing timely developments to the people of Mysore. The task of holding the exhibition is now entrusted with the Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA). This exhibition starts during Dasara and goes on till December. Various stalls which sell items like clothes, plastic items, kitchenware, cosmetics and eatables are set up and they attract a significant number of people. A play area containing attractions like a Ferris wheel is also present to provide entertainment to the people. Various Governmental agencies setup stalls to signify the achievements and projects that they have undertaken. Other programmes On all the 10 days of Dasara, various music and dance concerts are held in auditoriums around Mysore city. Musicians and dance groups from all over India are invited to perform on this occasion. Another attraction during Dasara is the Kusti Spardhe (wrestling- bout) which attracts wrestlers from all around India. it is also called banimantap there the people who are trained do bike parades etc  Controversy  The Dasara procession has faced increasing pressure from activists and campaigners to end its controversial use of elephants. Procession elephants, as well as their handlers known as ‚Äòmahouts‚Äô, have died from several shocking incidents over the years. In 2018, leaked footage from the elephants‚Äô training ground showed an elephant swaying in distress. International press labelled the video ‚Äúheartbreaking‚Äù, and reported on how the elephants must undergo two months of ‚Äúrigorous training‚Äù in order to perform in the procession.

The nth subharmonic of a signal of fundamental frequency F is a signal with frequency F/n. This differs from ordinary harmonics, where the nth harmonic of fundamental frequency F is a signal of frequency nF. Subharmonic synthesizers can be used in professional audio applications as bass enhancement devices during the playback of recorded music. Other uses for subharmonic synthesizers include the application in bandwidth extension. A subharmonic synthesizer can be used to extend low frequency response due to bandwidth limitations of telephone systems. Subharmonic synthesizers are used extensively in dance clubs in certain genres of music such as disco and house music. They are often implemented to enhance the lower frequencies, in an attempt to gain a \\"heavier\\" or more vibrant sound. Various harmonics can be amplified or modulated, although it is most common to boost the fundamental frequency's lower octave. The kick drum can benefit greatly from this type of processing. A subharmonic synthesizer (or \\"synth\\" as it is known in the industry) creates a bigger presence and can give the music that much sought- after \\"punch\\". History During the disco era, sound engineers aimed to create a more powerful, deep bass sound in dance clubs and nightclubs. A key approach used by engineers to get heavier, deeper bass sound was to add huge subwoofer cabinets to reproduce the sub-bass frequencies. The Paradise Garage discotheque in New York City, which operated from 1977 to 1987, had \\"custom designed 'sub-bass' speakers\\" developed by Alex Rosner's disciple, sound engineer Richard (\\"Dick\\") Long Brewster, Bill; Broughton, Frank. The Record Players: DJ Revolutionaries. Black Cat. p. 64 that were called \\"Levan Horns\\" (in honor of resident DJ Larry Levan). By the end of the 1970s, subwoofers were used in dance venue sound systems to enable the playing of \\"[b]ass-heavy dance music\\" that we \\"do not 'hear' with our ears but with our entire body\\". Lawrence, Tim. ‚ÄúBeyond the Hustle: Seventies Social Dancing, Discotheque Culture and the Emergence of the Contemporary Club Dancer‚Äù. In Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader, ed. Julie Malnig. University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 204 One challenge with getting deep sub-bass was that in the era of vinyl records, \\"to get as much music as possible on a record, recording engineers must limit the depth and excursion of record grooves. So in the recording process, the lower frequencies are often deliberately reduced or cut off altogether.\\" To overcome the lack of sub-bass frequencies on 1970s disco records (sub-bass frequencies below 60 Hz were removed during mastering), Long added a DBX 100 \\"Boom Box\\" subharmonic synthesizer into his system.Papenburg, Jens Gerrit. \\"Enhanced Bass\\" in Sound as Popular Culture: A Research Companion, edited by Jens Gerrit Papenburg, Holger Schulze. MIT Press, 2016. p. 210 The DBX 100 Sub Harmonic Synthesizer \\"recreates this lost portion of the audio spectrum by seizing information in the 50-100 Hz range, creating a signal one octave lower (25-50 Hz) and mixing this new signal back into the program.\\" The dbx 120A Subharmonic Synthesizer with Modeled Waveform Synthesis provides two separate bands of bass synthesis and a subwoofer output jack.

The new 2-baht coin design features H.M. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Great on the obverse, like all other Thai legal tender coins presently in circulation. The reverse design depicts the Golden Mountain at Wat Saket Ratcha Wora Maha Wihan in Bangkok. Before the two-baht coin entered into circulation, this denomination was used as a commemorative coin since 1979. As of 1996, there is one cupronickel and forty cupronickel-clad-copper commemorative coin series. On September 15, 2005, the Royal Thai Mint began minting two-baht coins to complete the binary system in Thailand's coinage. That is, each successive denomination is worth twice, or roughly twice, as much as the previous one. Thai coin denominations in general circulation are now 25 satang, 50 satang, 1 baht, 2 baht, 5 baht, and 10 baht. Recent statistics show that the one-baht coins constitute about 60% of the total coin circulation in the Thai economy. According to the Treasury Department, the issuance of the two-baht coins will solve the overwhelming demand for the one- baht coins as the two-baht coins now fill the gap between the one- and five- baht coins. This translates into savings in time and materials for the mint. The mint is considering expanding the use of multi-ply plated steel technology to other coin denominations due to volatile base metal prices and rising production costs. On February 3, 2009, the Royal Thai Mint released the new series two-baht coin, minted in 2008, which uses aluminium bronze in place of the former nickel-clad low-carbon steel.  2005-2007 two-baht coin  The original two-baht coin was minted 2005-2007, and was the sole two-baht coin in circulation from 2005 until February 3, 2009, when the new design was released. The old design will not be removed from circulation. The obverse was designed by Mrs Phutthachat Arunwet (), and sculpted by Mr Panya Khamkhen (). The reverse was designed by Mr Chaiyod Soontrapa (), and sculpted by Mr Thammanun Kaeosawang ().Profile of the old two-baht coin, Treasury Department website. Retrieved on March 2, 2009.

Excavations on a three-hectare site south of the village have revealed remains of a Roman farm villa with extensive 2nd-century Gallo-Roman mosaics. The site was occupied for more than 600 years. Originally a modest farmstead built a few kilometres south of the Via Domitia, on the hillside overlooking the Bassin de Thau, it rapidly prospered and grew. During the early Empire, in the 1st and 2nd centuries, the villa was a large patrician residence with thermal springs. The main agricultural activity was viticulture, for which a storehouse capable of holding 1,500 hl of wine was constructed. This period also saw the building of a small port on the northern shore of the Bassin de Thau, as well as pottery workshops producing amphorae for the transportation of wine. In the 5th century, the villa was completely rebuilt and the owner's home turned into a small mansion. The thirteen ground floor rooms are covered in multicoloured, highly decorated mosaics. The potteries by now were producing not just amphorae but also household pottery. The mosaics The springs from the original house were decorated with 2nd- century mosaics. However, those in the later villa are unique inasmuch as there is no other villa in which the influences of two such geographically separated countries, Aquitaine and Syria, have come together. This oddity is perhaps explained by the eclectic taste of the owner, or possibly simply from a desire to have the work completed quickly. In theory, a team of four mosaic workers would take a whole year to cover a 500 m2 floor. At Loupian, two teams working together could have laid the original 450 m2 in between six and eighteen months. Visitor information A 1000 m2 building protects the remains of the villa and its mosaics. Guided tours of the site and its museum are available, in French, every day in summer and on Wednesdays and weekends outside the season (closed in January). Tours in English are available at certain times. External links *Villa, villae in roman Gaul.

As of 2019, it has 5,020 inhabitants. History The town was founded in early 1920s when, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the railroad hub in nearby ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ (Bentschen) became part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1922, the government of Weimar Germany decided to build a new border station, a new rail hub (which replaced Zbaszyn) as well as a settlement for railroad workers. Within a few years in 1923-30, a large station was constructed, together with a modern suburban type settlement, based on a project by architect Friedrich Veil. The town, named Neu Bentschen, was inhabited by ethnic German railroad workers. There were two churches, a printing shop, a house of culture (Deutsches Haus), a school, a mail office and a bank. The settlement belonged to the Meseritz county. It was from German Neu-Bentschen (now ZbƒÖszynek) that thousands of Polish Jews expelled from Germany in October, 1938, were forced into Polish ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ, among them the parents of Herschel Grynszpan. World War II Following the invasion of Poland in World War II, the Germans opened a forced-labour camp in ZbƒÖszynek, in which various categories of prisoners were kept including POWs from France, Italy, and, after 1941, from the Soviet Union, as well as Jews from the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto. Hundreds died of diseases and exhaustion. Those who survived, worked on the rail infrastructure, which was necessary for transports to the Eastern front. In January 1945 some German inhabitants of Neu Bentschen fled the advancing Red Army and the town was captured without fighting. As a result of the territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II following the Potsdam Conference, it was part of the German territory transferred to Poland. The remaining populace was expelled to Germany. Neu Bentschen was briefly called Nowy ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ, some time in late 1940s, the name was changed to ZbƒÖszynek.

Like every standard-issue coin in Thailand, its obverse features the King of Thailand, Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun and previously Bhumibol Adulyadej. The newest coin features King Vajiralongkorn's royal monogram on its reverse side while the previous set featured Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawora Mahavihara seen from the Chao Phraya River. Ten-baht coin has been used as a commemorative coin for many occasions since 1971. As of March 2012, there are one silver, twenty- three nickel, twenty-three cupronickel and fifty-eight bi-metallic face-valued ten-baht commemorative coin series. Features Raised dots corresponding to Braille cell dot 1 and dots 2-4-5, which correspond to the number 10, are at the 12 o'clock position on the reverse of the standard-issue 10-baht coin. Braille enumeration does not appear on coins of other denominations, nor on ten-baht coins frequently issued as commemorative coins (for example, the 50th and 60th Anniversary of Accession to the Throne of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.) The bi-metallic ten-baht coin is very similar to the two‚Äìeuro coin, which first minted in 2002, in size, shape and weight and likewise consists of two different alloys. Vending machines that are not equipped with an up-to-date coin-checking system might therefore accept them as ‚Ç¨2 coins. This similarity is because both coins are minted on the model of the defunct Italian 500 lire coin, the world's first modern bi-metallic coin. To mint its 10 baht coin in 1988, the Thai government had to be allowed by the Italian mint, which had an international copyright over bi-metallic minting. The 10 baht is a perfect copy of the 500 lire coin even in its alloy, being made of acmonital for the outer ring and bronzital for the centre plug, but slightly larger (26 mm to 25.80 mm) and heavier (8.5 g to 6.8 g). Series 2009 changes In 2009, a new series of Thai baht coins were released in circulation. The Ten-baht coin was issued for this series, the difference is the redesign of the portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the obverse, to reflect his current age.

They provide a broad justification defence and a wide range of exceptions which have been criticised for undermining the concept of discrimination law by providing too many compromises on what would otherwise be unlawful. Default Retirement Age Significant issues addressed by the legislation include the provision of a national default retirement age set at 65 (to be retained for at least 5 years) and the ability for employees to request work beyond the retirement age following procedure in schedule 6 of the Regulations. A legal challenge to the Default Retirement Age (\\"DRA\\") brought by the charity Age UK failed in September 2009, with the judge finding that the Regulations did not breach the European Union's Equal Treatment at Work Directive.

The trio was soon discovered by legendary music producer/songwriter, Ken Gold, who also wrote and produced hits like ‚ÄúYou to Me Are Everything‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Get By Without You‚Äù for The Real Thing. Ken and his writing partner, Micky Denne, also wrote songs for the legendary queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, Jackie Wilson, and Cliff Richard, to name but a few. In 1976, Delegation released their first single, ‚ÄúThe Promise Of Love‚Äù, taken from their debut album of the same name, and released on the State Records label. Unfortunately, this single wasn‚Äôt as successful as expected, but it was after the release of their second single, ‚ÄúWhere Is The Love We Used To Know‚Äù also from the same album, that their fortunes changed for the better. That single charted in February 1977, and gave the group their first hit, and consequently, their first ‚ÄúTop Of The Pops‚Äù appearance in the UK, by far the most popular music TV show of its day. Ray Patterson replaced Roddy Harris later that year and the group released their third single, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Been Doing Me Wrong‚Äù, which became their second hit from the Promise Of Love album. ‚ÄúOh Honey‚Äù, a smooth ballad (also from the Promise Of Love album), gave the group their first US hit in 1979. This song reached #5 in the US RnB charts. Bruce Dunbar was visiting the UK from the US at the same time they were looking for a falsetto singer to replace the recently departed Len Coley. Rick Bailey and Ray Patterson placed an advert in the Melody Maker music magazine and Bruce answered the call. The chemistry was there from the offset, so they decided to include him in the lineup. The timing was right because they had just signed to Ariola Records and they were already in the process of making their second album ‚ÄúEau De Vie‚Äù. This album turned out to be very successful, with hits like ‚ÄúYou And I‚Äù, ‚ÄúPut A Little Love On Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúHeartache #9,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDarling I Think About You‚Äù, again, with Ken Gold in the producer‚Äôs chair. Bruce Left the Group 1981 and returned to the states after their third album entitled ‚ÄúDelegation‚Äù. Rick and Ray continued touring and recording extensively as a duo for a number of years after that. Two more albums were made, ‚ÄúDeuces High‚Äù (the bands fourth), and ‚ÄúEncore‚Äù. Ray Patterson decided to quit in the mid-‚Äô80s and Rick made the decision to go it alone. Delegation is still very much active as a live outfit, touring as the ‚ÄúDelegation Band‚Äù (with original founder member Rick Bailey, at the helm).

It is also officially known as the Tribe of Mar.Tribe of Mar Official Website retrieved 21 November 2016. The chiefs of the Clan Mar were the original Earls of Mar, although this title later went via an heiress to the Douglases in the late fourteenth century, and then to the Stewarts before going to the Erskines. The current chief of Clan Mar is Margaret of Mar, Countess.  History   Origins of the Clan  One of the seven ancient provinces or kingdoms of Scotland that was ruled by a Mormaer, which was an ancient Pictish equivalent of an Earl, was the Mormaerdom of Mar. The territory of the Earldom of Mar was in Aberdeenshire, between the River Dee and the River Don. Donald, Mormaer of Mar fought alongside the High King of Ireland, Brian Boru, against the Viking invaders at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. In a charter of 1114, erecting Scone Abbey, Rothri, Mormaer of Mar is named and is given the Latin title Comes which equates to the modern rank of Earl. Sometime before 1152 Morgg√°n (or Morgund) witnessed a charter to Dunfermline Abbey. Uilleam (William) was one of the Regents of Scotland and in 1264 he was the Great Chamberlain of the Realm. William's son was Domhnall (Donald) I who was knighted at Scone in September 1270 by Alexander III of Scotland. Donald witnessed the contract of marriage between Eric II of Norway and Margaret of Scotland. Donald also acknowledged Eric's daughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway as the lawful heir to the throne. However, Margaret died in Orkney en route to claim her kingdom.  Wars of Scottish Independence  The ruins of Kildrummy Castle which was the seat of early chiefs of Clan Mar. It is believed to have been built during the lordships of Uilleam (William) and Domhnall (Donald) I. The Earls of Mar supported Robert the Bruce's claim to the throne. Donald's eldest daughter was Isabella of Mar who was the first wife of Robert the Bruce. Isabella's brother was Gartnait (Gratney) who married Bruce's sister, Christina Bruce. Gratney was succeeded by his son, Domhnall (Donald) II. This Donald was captured at the Battle of Methven in 1306. He was then taken as a hostage to England and was not released until after the Scottish victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when several other hostages including the wife, sister and daughter of Robert the Bruce were exchanged for the Earl of Hereford. Mar was chosen as Regent of Scotland in 1332 but he only held the title for ten days. On the eve of his election to the post, Edward Balliol marched with his English troops to Perth while Mar gathered his troops to confront the invaders. In the dead of night the English fell upon the Scots army while they were asleep and totally routed them. The Earl of Mar was among those who were killed. Donald's son, the next earl, Thomas, died without issue and the title passed to Margaret, Countess of Mar who was his sister. From Margaret the title passed to her daughter, Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar. Isabella's second husband was Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, son of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, the feared Wolf of Badenoch.  15th to 16th Centuries  Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar died without issue and the claim to the Earldom of Mar passed to Robert Erskine, 1st Lord Erskine who was descended from Elyne, daughter of Gartnait (Gratney). Robert Erskine was recognized retrospectively as an Earl of Mar by an 1885 Act of Parliament.  17th century and Civil War  In 1615 Chief John Erskine was appointed governor of Edinburgh Castle. He supported Charles I of England. Lord Erskine fought for the royalists at the Battle of Kilsyth in 1645. The family estates were forfeited for their support of the royalists but were later restored by Charles II of England in 1660.  18th century and Jacobite risings  Chief John Erskine (known as \\"Bobbing John\\") supported the House of Stuart and the Jacobite cause during the uprisings. He had his honours forfeited for supporting the Jacobite cause. These honours were restored in 1824 by Act of parliament.

South 220th Street is no longer called West Old Cutler Road west of West 124th Avenue.  Historical Notes  The origins of this coastal route predates the building of roads in Dade County, as a trail along the high ridge of South Florida's coastline, often referred to by pioneer settlers as \\"The Reef.\\" From the state historical marker placed on the road: \\"Old Cutler Road owes its name to the former town of Cutler, a farming community founded by William Fuzzard in the late 1800s. The town was named after Dr. William Cutler of Massachusetts who visited the area about 1880 and encouraged Fuzzard and others to settle here. In 1883, Fuzzard, with the help of other residents of Cutler, cut a path north and east through a wilderness of pine rocklands and hardwood hammocks to the Village of Coconut Grove. The road followed a natural limestone ridge along Biscayne Bay, and established the first overland route connecting Coconut Grove and Cutler. It was subsequently widened to a wagon trail, and was declared a public road in 1895. The road became known as Cutler Road, later as Ingraham Highway, and still later as Old Cutler Road. Today, Old Cutler Road, which follows a somewhat altered course, maintains the appearance and atmosphere of a country road, and provides a tangible reminder of the heritage of the Miami area. Old Cutler Road was declared a State Historic Highway in 1974 by the Florida Legislature.\\" Progress on paving the route was greatly improved by installing a concrete bridge over Snapper Creek in 1916. Soon, the road reached all the way to Royal Palm Park, a magnificent natural area featuring the largest stand of Royal Palms in North America (later part of Everglades National Park). In 1916 members of the Miami Woman's Club successfully petitioned the Dade County Commission to name the road in honor of James Ingraham, brought in by Mr. Flagler as his Land Commissioner to manage FEC land holdings, buying, selling and attaining them as grants. Eventually, the FEC Land Department became the Model Land Company and Mr. Ingraham was given the title of ‚Äú3rd Vice President,‚Äù in charge of that company. The completion of Ingraham Highway to the Everglades was instrumental in the establishment of Florida's first state park: Royal Palm State Park, owned by the General Federation of Woman's Clubs. Several prominent land owners were successful in diverting the original highway around their properties. Just south of Snapper Creek, the road once ran through the Montgomery Estate (now Montgomery Botanical Center), right past the main house, proceeding through what is now the Gulliver School property. Further south, the road ran through Chapman Field USDA Subtropical Horticulture Research Station, and further, through the Charles Deering Estate, past the historic Richmond Cottage early settlement on Biscayne Bay. From the History of Chapman Field: \\"Within the USDA Station at Chapman field, an access road west of and parallel to 60th Avenue is a remnant of the old Ingraham Highway, which was relocated about three quarters of a mile to the west as the base was constructed. Ingraham Highway would eventually be renamed Old Cutler Road.\\" http://www.pinecrest- fl.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=39 Deering successfully petitioned the Dade County Commission to allow him to divert the road around his estate in exchange for building a public dock at the south end of his property which would allow local farmers and the general public direct access to Biscayne Bay. Remnants of the old road still run through these properties, and some portions of the original route, notably in Coconut Grove and near the entrance to Everglades National Park, still carry the name Ingraham Highway.

When the Dominicans took over the mission field of Baja California from the Franciscans in 1773, the missions in the central and southern parts of the peninsula were in evident decline, as their Indian populations dwindled under the impact of Old World diseases. However, the northern portion of the peninsula, only recently reconnoitered by Gaspar de Portol√° and Junipero Serra, had much more potential. The site of El Rosario, located near the western coast among the northernmost Cochim√≠ Indians, was chosen as the initial Dominican mission site. The location had been initially identified by the soldier Jos√© Vel√°squez in 1770 and had been favored by the Franciscans as a potential mission site. Its native name was variously given as Vi√±adaco, Mi√±araco, and Vi√±atacot. In 1802, the mission was moved from its first site to a location about 6 kilometers closer to the coast with more space, more agricultural land, and better access to external supplies. When the second site ceased to function as a mission in 1832, it was turned over to local residents. Ruined walls and foundations from both the first and the second mission survive.

It can grow to a length of up to . Description Male spotless smooth- hounds grow to a length of about with females growing to around . The head is short with a fairly long, bluntly pointed snout and the body is slender. The eyes are small and close together. The mouth is long and the lower lip groove is usually longer than the upper one. The teeth are molar-like with low cusps. Both the dorsal fins have a curved trailing edge and the distance separating them occupies about 20% of the total length of the fish. The dorsal surface and flanks are grey or greyish-brown and the ventral surface is paler. The colour is uniform and there are no spots or bands of darker or lighter colour. Distribution and habitat The spotless smooth-hound is found in the temperate and tropical Pacific Ocean between 40¬∞N and 11¬∞N, off the coast of Vietnam, Japan, China and Taiwan, and possibly the Philippines. It occurs on the continental shelf and in semi-enclosed areas of sea at depths down to and possibly as deep as . It is found near the seabed, often over sandy substrates and is thought to feed on crustaceans and other benthic invertebrates. Biology The spotless smooth-hound is viviparous. Males become sexually mature at a length of between and females at . Litter size varies between about five and sixteen pups which are nourished by yolk sac placentas. The gestation period is about ten months and the pups measure about at birth. Maximum recorded age is nine years. Status The spotless smooth-hound is used for human consumption of its flesh and fins which are much esteemed. It is caught using gillnets, trawls and longline fishing, either as bycatch or as a targeted species. It is not known whether the level of fishing is sustainable or whether the population is in decline. The IUCN has listed its conservation status of this shark as being \\"data deficient\\" and considers that further survey work needs to be done to assess population trends and catch sizes.

He also became a part-owner of the franchise. His nephew Connie Mack III became a U.S. Senator. Mack was born in Spencer, Massachusetts and attended Niagara University and the University of Notre Dame. He played only five games for the Athletics between 1910 and 1914, at third base, first base, and catcher. In his only appearance in 1910, he went 2 for 4, including a triple. These would prove to be his only major league hits, as he was not played again until the following year, when he appeared in two games. Again, he would play in two games in 1914, without a hit, though he did get on base (driving in a run) and steal a base. This ended his playing career with a career batting average of .125. Mack's appearances were in the final games of the season; he played after the Athletics had clinched the pennant in each of the three seasons in which he played, and they went on to win World Series titles in 1910 and 1911. Since Mack had not been on the Athletics' roster before September 1 as required by the rules, he was ineligible to play in the World Series‚Äîeven if his father had been minded to play him. As a minor league player in 1910, Mack batted .135 in 26 games. From 1913 until 1915, Mack served as player-manager of the Raleigh team in the Class D North Carolina State League. He returned in the same capacity for the Charlotte franchise in 1917 until the league folded (no doubt a war casualty) on May 30. Mack then became player-manager of the Hanover (Pennsylvania) Raiders of the Blue Ridge League, another Class D circuit. Mack achieved some success as the player/manager of the Moline Plowboys of the Class B Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League (often called the Three-I, or Three-Eye League). In 1921, his team, with almost no legitimate major league prospects, won the Three-I pennant. However, in his three years there (1920‚Äì22), the team had only a 196-214 record. Mack's final season as a minor league manager was 1923, returning to the Blue Ridge League and managing the Martinsburg (WV) Blue Sox to a 67-30 record and the pennant. His father, the manager and part owner of the Athletics, hired him as a coach and assistant manager in 1924. During the 1937 and 1939 seasons, Mack managed the Athletics when his father (by then in his mid-70s) was ill. It was widely expected that when his father retired, Earle would manage the team and Connie Jr. (Earle's younger half-brother) would run the front office. This was not to be. In May 1950, he was moved to the position of chief scout and was replaced as coach and assistant manager by Jimmy Dykes ‚Äì a disappointment, as he had hoped to succeed his father as permanent manager of the Athletics. In spite of this, in August, with his brother Roy Mack, he was able to gain control over the franchise, purchasing shares from Connie Jr. While Roy and Earle Mack announced that their father was free to manage as long as he wanted to, Connie Mack announced his retirement only seven weeks later, at age 88.Connie Mack Baseball Library The team was heavily mortgaged, though, and continued to perform poorly both on the field and at the box office. Eventually, the Mack brothers were forced to sell, and the team relocated to Kansas City in 1954. Earle Mack died at age 77 in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania and is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Morganton, Burke County, NC.

Together with Almendra and Los Gatos, they are considered founders of Argentine rock.El Rock Portal Oficial del Gobierno de la Rep√∫blica Argentina.(Spanish) The band members were Claudio Gabis on guitar, Javier Mart√≠nez on drums and vocals, and Alejandro Medina on bass and vocals. Mart√≠nez was the band's lead vocalist and leading songwriter.  Trajectory   1968‚Äì1969: Formation  The band grew out of the mythic \\"La Cueva\\" club. Mart√≠nez was a regular, and Gabis played guitar with several bands, including Miguel Abuelo's Los Abuelos.Explorando el blues argentino Claudio Gabis Biograf√≠a (Spanish) Gabis was not keen about joining a band and regularly as he was committed to college, but eventually was persuaded by Mart√≠nez, and Manal was born. The name \\"Manal\\" was based on the word mano (\\"hand\\"), which had acquired an additional meaning among young people in Buenos Aires, to refer to \\"things\\" or \\"the situation\\" (e.g. c√≥mo viene la mano, lit. \\"how's the hand coming\\", would mean \\"how are things going\\"). Mart√≠nez would use \\"manal\\" as a made-up adjective, instead of the correct \\"manual\\". Manal was influenced by The Beatles, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, The Animals and other blues rock acts, bringing the blues to Argentina's rock conscience. In 1968, after their demos being rejected by multiple record labels, the band approached long time friend and producer Jorge √Ålvarez, who teamed up with Pedro Puj√≥ and created the Mandioca label, which became the first label exclusively dedicated to Argentine rock.Javier Mart√≠nez Biograf√≠a Inforock.com (Spanish) Under the fledgling label, Manal released their first two singles in 1968. Their moment of triumph came at the 1969 Pinap Festival. On the back of their near daily performances throughout the year, the group's tightness was apparent. Fans ended up doing choruses and singing along with Manal's three members, who had resorted to a cappella vocals as their bass and drums broke down from overuse.Manal www.rock.com.ar (Spanish)  1970‚Äì1972: Breakthrough Success and Break-Up  Manal released a self-titled debut album in 1970. Sales were encouraging, prompting RCA to offer the band a contract. Their major label debut El Le√≥n (1971) proved less successful than Manal. By 1972 however, musical tastes had changed. Acoustic rock (with folk-rock influences) was on the verge of an explosion fueled by artists such as Le√≥n Gieco, and a heavier rock had become dominant. Blues-rock fell out of favor, and Manal couldn't make the transition. Their third album in 1972 was poorly received, leading to the break-up of the band that same year. Pappo, who was more at ease courting heavy metal audiences, would become the godfather of Argentine blues, a role he kept for over thirty years.  1980‚Äì1981: Reunion  However, in 1980, Argentine rock was caught up in a revival period of rock from the late 1960s, with Almendra successfully reuniting. Producers asked Manal to do the same, which they did, and produced one last LP in 1981, named Reuni√≥n (reunion), but due to differences between Martinez and Gabis the meeting lasted only until 1981. After that meeting, Claudio Gabis not accept return to play again with Javier Martinez. Manal's well-attended last concerts across Argentina led to a live album, and helped mitigate the unfortunate climate of their first separation. Furthermore, during the 1982 war, English- language music was informally banned from the airwaves for several months, resulting in increased airplay for Argentine bands, including Manal.  1987‚Äì1994: Reformations without Claudio Gabis  In 1987 Javier Mart√≠nez returned from France and reunited Manal with Aldo Giacommino (guitars), Luis de Le√≥n (bass), Jorge Iacobellis (drums) and Jorge Szajko (keyboards and saxophone). Today, Manal are credited with bringing the grittier form of blues-rock to Argentine rock,.Manal www.VH1.com -- by Wade Kergan (Allmusic Guide contributor) Few at the time could have foreseen the strong influence Manal would have on the suburban rock explosion of the mid 1990s. Throughout their career, Manal's lyrics suggested a more mature outlook on life than their hippie-influenced colleagues. One song advised that the recipe for success was to have \\"cold tomato juice (flowing) in your veins\\".

Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant. As the main energy-consuming and greenhouse-gas‚Äìemitting stage of cement manufacture, improvement of kiln efficiency has been the central concern of cement manufacturing technology. The manufacture of cement clinker A preheater tower, rawmix silo and exhaust stack. Bottom left: rawmill. Bottom right: rotary kiln with tertiary air duct above. The U-shaped duct leading from the kiln inlet is an \\"alkali bleed\\". A typical process of manufacture consists of three stages: * grinding a mixture of limestone and clay or shale to make a fine \\"rawmix\\" (see Rawmill); * heating the rawmix to sintering temperature (up to 1450 ¬∞C) in a cement kiln; * grinding the resulting clinker to make cement (see Cement mill). In the second stage, the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot gases from combustion of the kiln fuel. Successive chemical reactions take place as the temperature of the rawmix rises: * 70 to 110 ¬∞C - Free water is evaporated. * 400 to 600 ¬∞C - clay-like minerals are decomposed into their constituent oxides; principally SiO2 and Al2O3. dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) decomposes to calcium carbonate (CaCO3), MgO and CO2. * 650 to 900 ¬∞C - calcium carbonate reacts with SiO2 to form belite (Ca2SiO4) (also known as C2S in the Cement Industry). * 900 to 1050 ¬∞C - the remaining calcium carbonate decomposes to calcium oxide (CaO) and CO2. * 1300 to 1450 ¬∞C - partial (20‚Äì30%) melting takes place, and belite reacts with calcium oxide to form alite (Ca3O¬∑SiO4) (also known as C3S in the Cement Industry). Typical clinker nodules Alite is the characteristic constituent of Portland cement. Typically, a peak temperature of 1400‚Äì1450 ¬∞C is required to complete the reaction. The partial melting causes the material to aggregate into lumps or nodules, typically of diameter 1‚Äì10 mm. This is called clinker. The hot clinker next falls into a cooler which recovers most of its heat, and cools the clinker to around 100 ¬∞C, at which temperature it can be conveniently conveyed to storage. The cement kiln system is designed to accomplish these processes. Early history Portland cement clinker was first made (in 1825) in a modified form of the traditional static lime kiln.R G Blezard, The History of Calcareous Cements in P C Hewlett (Ed), Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete, 4th Ed, Arnold, 1998, A C Davis, A Hundred Years of Portland Cement, 1824-1924, Concrete Publications Ltd, London, 1924G R Redgrave & C Spackman, Calcareous Cements: their Nature, Manufacture and Uses, London, 1924 The basic, egg-cup shaped lime kiln was provided with a conical or beehive shaped extension to increase draught and thus obtain the higher temperature needed to make cement clinker. For nearly half a century, this design, and minor modifications, remained the only method of manufacture. The kiln was restricted in size by the strength of the chunks of rawmix: if the charge in the kiln collapsed under its own weight, the kiln would be extinguished. For this reason, beehive kilns never made more than 30 tonnes of clinker per batch. A batch took one week to turn around: a day to fill the kiln, three days to burn off, two days to cool, and a day to unload. Thus, a kiln would produce about 1500 tonnes per year. Around 1885, experiments began on design of continuous kilns. One design was the shaft kiln, similar in design to a blast furnace. Rawmix in the form of lumps and fuel were continuously added at the top, and clinker was continually withdrawn at the bottom. Air was blown through under pressure from the base to combust the fuel. The shaft kiln had a brief period of use before it was eclipsed by the rotary kiln, but it had a limited renaissance from 1970 onward in China and elsewhere, when it was used for small-scale, low-tech plants in rural areas away from transport routes. Several thousand such kilns were constructed in China. A typical shaft kiln produces 100-200 tonnes per day. From 1885, trials began on the development of the rotary kiln, which today accounts for more than 95% of world production. The rotary kiln General layout of a rotary kiln The rotary kiln consists of a tube made from steel plate, and lined with firebrick. The tube slopes slightly (1‚Äì4¬∞) and slowly rotates on its axis at between 30 and 250 revolutions per hour. Rawmix is fed in at the upper end, and the rotation of the kiln causes it gradually to move downhill to the other end of the kiln. At the other end fuel, in the form of gas, oil, or pulverized solid fuel, is blown in through the \\"burner pipe\\", producing a large concentric flame in the lower part of the kiln tube. As material moves under the flame, it reaches its peak temperature, before dropping out of the kiln tube into the cooler. Air is drawn first through the cooler and then through the kiln for combustion of the fuel. In the cooler the air is heated by the cooling clinker, so that it may be 400 to 800 ¬∞C before it enters the kiln, thus causing intense and rapid combustion of the fuel. The earliest successful rotary kilns were developed in Pennsylvania around 1890, based on a design by Frederick Ransome,http://www.cementkilns.co.uk/early_rotary_kilns.html and were about 1.5 m in diameter and 15 m in length. Such a kiln made about 20 tonnes of clinker per day. The fuel, initially, was oil, which was readily available in Pennsylvania at the time. It was particularly easy to get a good flame with this fuel. Within the next 10 years, the technique of firing by blowing in pulverized coal was developed, allowing the use of the cheapest available fuel. By 1905, the largest kilns were 2.7 x 60 m in size, and made 190 tonnes per day. At that date, after only 15 years of development, rotary kilns accounted for half of world production. Since then, the capacity of kilns has increased steadily, and the largest kilns today produce around 10,000 tonnes per day. In contrast to static kilns, the material passes through quickly: it takes from 3 hours (in some old wet process kilns) to as little as 10 minutes (in short precalciner kilns). Rotary kilns run 24 hours a day, and are typically stopped only for a few days once or twice a year for essential maintenance. One of the main maintenance works on rotary kilns is tyre and roller surface machining and grinding works which can be done while the kiln works in full operation at speeds up to 3.5 rpm. This is an important discipline, because heating up and cooling down are long, wasteful and damaging processes. Uninterrupted runs as long as 18 months have been achieved. The wet process and the dry process % of North American Capacity using Wet Process Mean Fuel Energy used in North American KilnsFrom the earliest times, two different methods of rawmix preparation were used: the mineral components were either dry-ground to form a flour-like powder, or were wet-ground with added water to produce a fine slurry with the consistency of paint, and with a typical water content of 40‚Äì45%.Trend charts are based on USGS Annual Reports (for detailed output) and Cembureau World Cement Reports (for process details). The wet process suffered the obvious disadvantage that, when the slurry was introduced into the kiln, a large amount of extra fuel was used in evaporating the water. Furthermore, a larger kiln was needed for a given clinker output, because much of the kiln's length was used up for the drying process. On the other hand, the wet process had a number of advantages. Wet grinding of hard minerals is usually much more efficient than dry grinding. When slurry is dried in the kiln, it forms a granular crumble that is ideal for subsequent heating in the kiln. In the dry process, it is very difficult to keep the fine powder rawmix in the kiln, because the fast-flowing combustion gases tend to blow it back out again. It became a practice to spray water into dry kilns in order to \\"damp down\\" the dry mix, and thus, for many years there was little difference in efficiency between the two processes, and the overwhelming majority of kilns used the wet process. By 1950, a typical large, wet process kiln, fitted with drying-zone heat exchangers, was 3.3 x 120 m in size, made 680 tonnes per day, and used about 0.25‚Äì0.30 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. Before the energy crisis of the 1970s put an end to new wet-process installations, kilns as large as 5.8 x 225 m in size were making 3000 tonnes per day. An interesting footnote on the wet process history is that some manufacturers have in fact made very old wet process facilities profitable through the use of waste fuels. Plants that burn waste fuels enjoy a negative fuel cost (they are paid by industries needing to dispose of materials that have energy content and can be safely disposed of in the cement kiln thanks to its high temperatures and longer retention times). As a result, the inefficiency of the wet process is an advantage‚Äîto the manufacturer. By locating waste burning operations at older wet process locations, higher fuel consumption actually equates to higher profits for the manufacturer, although it produces correspondingly greater emission of CO2. Manufacturers who think such emissions should be reduced are abandoning the use of wet process. Preheaters In the 1930s, significantly, in Germany, the first attempts were made to redesign the kiln system to minimize waste of fuel.K E Peray, The Rotary Cement Kiln, CHS Press, 1998, , Chapter 2 , Hewlett op cit, pp 73-77 This led to two significant developments: * the grate preheater * the gas-suspension preheater. Grate preheaters The grate preheater consists of a chamber containing a chain-like high-temperature steel moving grate, attached to the cold end of the rotary kiln.Peray op cit, Hewlett op cit, pp 73,74,76 A dry-powder rawmix is turned into a hard pellets of 10‚Äì20 mm diameter in a nodulizing pan, with the addition of 10-15% water. The pellets are loaded onto the moving grate, and the hot combustion gases from the rear of the kiln are passed through the bed of pellets from beneath. This dries and partially calcines the rawmix very efficiently. The pellets then drop into the kiln. Very little powdery material is blown out of the kiln. Because the rawmix is damped in order to make pellets, this is referred to as a \\"semi-dry\\" process. The grate preheater is also applicable to the \\"semi-wet\\" process, in which the rawmix is made as a slurry, which is first de-watered with a high-pressure filter, and the resulting \\"filter-cake\\" is extruded into pellets, which are fed to the grate. In this case, the water content of the pellets is 17-20%. Grate preheaters were most popular in the 1950s and 60s, when a typical system would have a grate 28 m long and 4 m wide, and a rotary kiln of 3.9 x 60 m, making 1050 tonnes per day, using about 0.11-0.13 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. Systems up to 3000 tonnes per day were installed. Gas-suspension preheaters Cutaway view of cyclone showing air path The key component of the gas-suspension preheater is the cyclone. A cyclone is a conical vessel into which a dust- bearing gas-stream is passed tangentially. This produces a vortex within the vessel. The gas leaves the vessel through a co-axial \\"vortex-finder\\". The solids are thrown to the outside edge of the vessel by centrifugal action, and leave through a valve in the vertex of the cone. Cyclones were originally used to clean up the dust-laden gases leaving simple dry process kilns. If, instead, the entire feed of rawmix is encouraged to pass through the cyclone, it is found that a very efficient heat exchange takes place: the gas is efficiently cooled, hence producing less waste of heat to the atmosphere, and the raw mix is efficiently heated. This efficiency is further increased if a number of cyclones are connected in series. 4-Stage preheater, showing path of feed The number of cyclones stages used in practice varies from 1 to 6. Energy, in the form of fan-power, is required to draw the gases through the string of cyclones, and at a string of 6 cyclones, the cost of the added fan- power needed for an extra cyclone exceeds the efficiency advantage gained. It is normal to use the warm exhaust gas to dry the raw materials in the rawmill, and if the raw materials are wet, hot gas from a less efficient preheater is desirable. For this reason, the most commonly encountered suspension preheaters have 4 cyclones. The hot feed that leaves the base of the preheater string is typically 20% calcined, so the kiln has less subsequent processing to do, and can therefore achieve a higher specific output. Typical large systems installed in the early 1970s had cyclones 6 m in diameter, a rotary kiln of 5 x 75 m, making 2500 tonnes per day, using about 0.11-0.12 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. A penalty paid for the efficiency of suspension preheaters is their tendency to block up. Salts, such as the sulfate and chloride of sodium and potassium, tend to evaporate in the burning zone of the kiln. They are carried back in vapor form, and re-condense when a sufficiently low temperature is encountered. Because these salts re- circulate back into the rawmix and re-enter the burning zone, a recirculation cycle establishes itself. A kiln with 0.1% chloride in the rawmix and clinker may have 5% chloride in the mid-kiln material. Condensation usually occurs in the preheater, and a sticky deposit of liquid salts glues dusty rawmix into a hard deposit, typically on surfaces against which the gas-flow is impacting. This can choke the preheater to the point that air-flow can no longer be maintained in the kiln. It then becomes necessary to manually break the build- up away. Modern installations often have automatic devices installed at vulnerable points to knock out build-up regularly. An alternative approach is to \\"bleed off\\" some of the kiln exhaust at the kiln inlet where the salts are still in the vapor phase, and remove and discard the solids in this. This is usually termed an \\"alkali bleed\\" and it breaks the recirculation cycle. It can also be of advantage for cement quality reasons, since it reduces the alkali content of the clinker. However, hot gas is run to waste so the process is inefficient and increases kiln fuel consumption. Precalciners % of North American Capacity using Precalciners Mean Daily Output (tonnes) of North American Kilns In the 1970s the precalciner was pioneered in Japan, and has subsequently become the equipment of choice for new large installations worldwide.Peray op cit, Hewlett op cit, pp 74-75 The precalciner is a development of the suspension preheater. The philosophy is this: the amount of fuel that can be burned in the kiln is directly related to the size of the kiln. If part of the fuel necessary to burn the rawmix is burned outside the kiln, the output of the system can be increased for a given kiln size. Users of suspension preheaters found that output could be increased by injecting extra fuel into the base of the preheater. The logical development was to install a specially designed combustion chamber at the base of the preheater, into which pulverized coal is injected. This is referred to as an \\"air- through\\" precalciner, because the combustion air for both the kiln fuel and the calciner fuel all passes through the kiln. This kind of precalciner can burn up to 30% (typically 20%) of its fuel in the calciner. If more fuel were injected in the calciner, the extra amount of air drawn through the kiln would cool the kiln flame excessively. The feed is 40-60% calcined before it enters the rotary kiln. The ultimate development is the \\"air-separate\\" precalciner, in which the hot combustion air for the calciner arrives in a duct directly from the cooler, bypassing the kiln. Typically, 60-75% of the fuel is burned in the precalciner. In these systems, the feed entering the rotary kiln is 100% calcined. The kiln has only to raise the feed to sintering temperature. In theory the maximum efficiency would be achieved if all the fuel were burned in the preheater, but the sintering operation involves partial melting and nodulization to make clinker, and the rolling action of the rotary kiln remains the most efficient way of doing this. Large modern installations typically have two parallel strings of 4 or 5 cyclones, with one attached to the kiln and the other attached to the precalciner chamber. A rotary kiln of 6 x 100 m makes 8,000‚Äì10,000 tonnes per day, using about 0.10-0.11 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. The kiln is dwarfed by the massive preheater tower and cooler in these installations. Such a kiln produces 3 million tonnes of clinker per year, and consumes 300,000 tonnes of coal. A diameter of 6 m appears to be the limit of size of rotary kilns, because the flexibility of the steel shell becomes unmanageable at or above this size, and the firebrick lining tends to fail when the kiln flexes. A particular advantage of the air-separate precalciner is that a large proportion, or even 100%, of the alkali-laden kiln exhaust gas can be taken off as alkali bleed (see above). Because this accounts for only 40% of the system heat input, it can be done with lower heat wastage than in a simple suspension preheater bleed. Because of this, air-separate precalciners are now always prescribed when only high-alkali raw materials are available at a cement plant. The accompanying figures show the movement towards the use of the more efficient processes in North America (for which data is readily available). But the average output per kiln in, for example, Thailand is twice that in North America. Ancillary equipment Essential equipment in addition to the kiln tube and the preheater are: * Cooler * Fuel mills * Fans * Exhaust gas cleaning equipment. Coolers A pair of kilns with satellite coolers in Ashaka, Nigeria Sysy Early systems used rotary coolers, which were rotating cylinders similar to the kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped.Peray op cit Chapter 18; Hewlett op cit,p. 77. The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7‚Äì9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no separate drive. From about 1930, the grate cooler was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which cold air is blown, enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 ¬∞C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, because they do not rotate, hot air can be ducted out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air. The latter advantage means that they have become the only type used in modern systems . Fuel mills Fuel systems are divided into two categories:Peray op cit Section 4.1; R H Perry, C H Chilton, D W Green, Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed, McGraw-Hill, 1997, , p 20.54 * Direct firing * Indirect firing cement plant In direct firing, the fuel is fed at a controlled rate to the fuel mill, and the fine product is immediately blown into the kiln. The advantage of this system is that it is not necessary to store the hazardous ground fuel: it is used as soon as it is made. For this reason it was the system of choice for older kilns. A disadvantage is that the fuel mill has to run all the time: if it breaks down, the kiln has to stop if no backup system is available. In indirect firing, the fuel is ground by an intermittently run mill, and the fine product is stored in a silo of sufficient size to supply the kiln though fuel mill stoppage periods. The fine fuel is metered out of the silo at a controlled rate and blown into the kiln. This method is now favoured for precalciner systems, because both the kiln and the precalciner can be fed with fuel from the same system. Special techniques are required to store the fine fuel safely, and coals with high volatiles are normally milled in an inert atmosphere (e.g. CO2). Fans A large volume of gases has to be moved through the kiln system.Peray op cit Sections 12.1, 12.2, 18.5 Particularly in suspension preheater systems, a high degree of suction has to be developed at the exit of the system to drive this. Fans are also used to force air through the cooler bed, and to propel the fuel into the kiln. Fans account for most of the electric power consumed in the system, typically amounting to 10‚Äì15 kW¬∑h per tonne of clinker. Gas cleaning The exhaust gases from a modern kiln typically amount to 2 tonnes (or 1500 cubic metres at STP) per tonne of clinker made.Hewlett op cit,pp 81-83 The gases carry a large amount of dust‚Äîtypically 30 grams per cubic metre. Environmental regulations specific to different countries require that this be reduced to (typically) 0.1 gram per cubic metre, so dust capture needs to be at least 99.7% efficient. Methods of capture include electrostatic precipitators and bag-filters. See also cement kiln emissions. Kiln fuels Used tires being fed mid-kiln to a pair of long kilns Fuels that have been used for primary firing include coal, petroleum coke, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, landfill off-gas and oil refinery flare gas.Peray op cit Chapter 4 Because the clinker is brought to its peak temperature mainly by radiant heat transfer, and a bright (i.e. high emissivity) and hot flame is essential for this, high carbon fuels such as coal which produces a luminous flame are preferred for kiln firing. In favorable circumstances, high-rank bituminous coal can produce a flame at 2050 ¬∞C. Natural gas can only produce a flame of, at best 1950 ¬∞C, and this is also less luminous, so it tends to result in lower kiln output.  Alternative fuels In addition to these primary fuels, various combustible waste materials have been fed to kilns. These alternative fuels (AF) include: * Used motor-vehicle tires * Sewage sludge * Agricultural waste * Landfill gas * Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) * Chemical and other hazardous waste Cement kilns are an attractive way of disposing of hazardous materials, because of: * the temperatures in the kiln, which are much higher than in other combustion systems (e.g. incinerators), * the alkaline conditions in the kiln, afforded by the high-calcium rawmix, which can absorb acidic combustion products, * the ability of the clinker to absorb heavy metals into its structure. A notable example is the use of scrapped motor-vehicle tires, which are very difficult to dispose of by other means. Whole tires are commonly introduced in the kiln by rolling them into the upper end of a preheater kiln, or by dropping them through a slot midway along a long wet kiln. In either case, the high gas temperatures (1000‚Äì1200 ¬∞C) cause almost instantaneous, complete and smokeless combustion of the tire. Alternatively, tires are chopped into 5‚Äì10 mm chips, in which form they can be injected into a precalciner combustion chamber. The steel and zinc in the tires become chemically incorporated into the clinker, partially replacing iron that must otherwise be fed as raw material. A high level of monitoring of both the fuel and its combustion products is necessary to maintain safe operation.Use of waste derived fuels in cement industry: a review, Nickolaos Chatziaras, Constantinos S. Psomopoulos, Nickolas J. Themelis, 2016, Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal, Vol. 27 Iss 2 pp. 178 - 193, https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MEQ-01-2015-0012, 08 March 2016 For maximum kiln efficiency, high quality conventional fuels are the best choice. However, burning any fuels, especially hazardous waste materials, can result in toxic emissions.https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/cement/basic.html Thus, it is necessary for operators of cement kilns to closely monitor many process variables to ensure emissions are continuously minimized. In the U.S., cement kilns are regulated as a major source of air pollution by the EPA and must meet stringent air pollution control requirements.https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/cement/actions.html Kiln control Online X-ray diffraction with automatic sample feed for free calcium oxide measurement The objective of kiln operation is to make clinker with the required chemical and physical properties, at the maximum rate that the size of kiln will allow, while meeting environmental standards, at the lowest possible operating cost.Peray op cit Chapter 14, Hewlett op cit,pp 76-7 The kiln is very sensitive to control strategies, and a poorly run kiln can easily double cement plant operating costs.Peray, op cit Formation of the desired clinker minerals involves heating the rawmix through the temperature stages mentioned above. The finishing transformation that takes place in the hottest part of the kiln, under the flame, is the reaction of belite (Ca2SiO4) with calcium oxide to form alite (Ca3O¬∑SiO5): :Ca2SiO4 \\\\+ CaO ‚Üí Ca3SiO5 Also abbreviated in the cement chemist notation (CCN) as: : C2S + C ‚Üí C3S :Tricalcium silicate is thermodynamically unstable below 1250 ¬∞C, but can be preserved in a metastable state at room temperature by fast cooling: on slow cooling it tends to revert to belite (Ca2SiO4) and CaO. If the reaction is incomplete, excessive amounts of free calcium oxide remain in the clinker. Regular measurement of the free CaO content is used as a means of tracking the clinker quality. As a parameter in kiln control, free CaO data is somewhat ineffective because, even with fast automated sampling and analysis, the data, when it arrives, may be 10 minutes \\"out of date\\", and more immediate data must be used for minute-to-minute control. Conversion of belite to alite requires partial melting, the resulting liquid being the solvent in which the reaction takes place. The amount of liquid, and hence the speed of the finishing reaction, is related to temperature. To meet the clinker quality objective, the most obvious control is that the clinker should reach a peak temperature such that the finishing reaction takes place to the required degree. A further reason to maintain constant liquid formation in the hot end of the kiln is that the sintering material forms a dam that prevents the cooler upstream feed from flooding out of the kiln. The feed in the calcining zone, because it is a powder evolving carbon dioxide, is extremely fluid. Cooling of the burning zone, and loss of unburned material into the cooler, is called \\"flushing\\", and in addition to causing lost production can cause massive damage. However, for efficient operation, steady conditions need to be maintained throughout the whole kiln system. The feed at each stage must be at a temperature such that it is \\"ready\\" for processing in the next stage. To ensure this, the temperature of both feed and gas must be optimized and maintained at every point. The external controls available to achieve this are few: * Feed rate: this defines the kiln output * Rotary kiln speed: this controls the rate at which the feed moves through the kiln tube * Fuel injection rate: this controls the rate at which the \\"hot end\\" of the system is heated * Exhaust fan speed or power: this controls gas flow, and the rate at which heat is drawn from the \\"hot end\\" of the system to the \\"cold end\\" In the case of precalciner kilns, further controls are available: * Independent control of fuel to kiln and calciner * Independent fan controls where there are multiple preheater strings. The independent use of fan speed and fuel rate is constrained by the fact that there must always be sufficient oxygen available to burn the fuel, and in particular, to burn carbon to carbon dioxide. If carbon monoxide is formed, this represents a waste of fuel, and also indicates reducing conditions within the kiln which must be avoided at all costs since it causes destruction of the clinker mineral structure. For this reason, the exhaust gas is continually analyzed for O2, CO, NO and SO2. The assessment of the clinker peak temperature has always been problematic. Contact temperature measurement is impossible because of the chemically aggressive and abrasive nature of the hot clinker, and optical methods such as infrared pyrometry are difficult because of the dust and fume-laden atmosphere in the burning zone. The traditional method of assessment was to view the bed of clinker and deduce the amount of liquid formation by experience. As more liquid forms, the clinker becomes stickier, and the bed of material climbs higher up the rising side of the kiln. It is usually also possible to assess the length of the zone of liquid formation, beyond which powdery \\"fresh\\" feed can be seen. Cameras, with or without infrared measurement capability, are mounted on the kiln hood to facilitate this. On many kilns, the same information can be inferred from the kiln motor power drawn, since sticky feed riding high on the kiln wall increases the eccentric turning load of the kiln. Further information can be obtained from the exhaust gas analyzers. The formation of NO from nitrogen and oxygen takes place only at high temperatures, and so the NO level gives an indication of the combined feed and flame temperature. SO2 is formed by thermal decomposition of calcium sulfate in the clinker, and so also gives in indication of clinker temperature. Modern computer control systems usually make a \\"calculated\\" temperature, using contributions from all these information sources, and then set about controlling it. As an exercise in process control, kiln control is extremely challenging, because of multiple inter-related variables, non-linear responses, and variable process lags. Computer control systems were first tried in the early 1960s, initially with poor results due mainly to poor process measurements. Since 1990, complex high-level supervisory control systems have been standard on new installations. These operate using expert system strategies, that maintain a \\"just sufficient\\" burning zone temperature, below which the kiln's operating condition will deteriorate catastrophically, thus requiring rapid-response, \\"knife-edge\\" control. Cement kiln emissions Emissions from cement works are determined both by continuous and discontinuous measuring methods, which are described in corresponding national guidelines and standards. Continuous measurement is primarily used for dust, NOx and SO2, while the remaining parameters relevant pursuant to ambient pollution legislation are usually determined discontinuously by individual measurements. The following descriptions of emissions refer to modern kiln plants based on dry process technology. Carbon dioxide During the clinker burning process CO2 is emitted. CO2 accounts for the main share of these gases. CO2 emissions are both raw material-related and energy-related. Raw material-related emissions are produced during limestone decarbonation (CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2) and account for about half of total CO2 emissions. Use of fuels with higher hydrogen content than coal and use of alternative fuels can reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. Dust To manufacture 1 t of Portland cement, about 1.5 to 1.7 t raw materials, 0.1 t coal and 1 t clinker (besides other cement constituents and sulfate agents) must be ground to dust fineness during production. In this process, the steps of raw material processing, fuel preparation, clinker burning and cement grinding constitute major emission sources for particulate components. While particulate emissions of up to 3,000 mg/m3 were measured leaving the stack of cement rotary kiln plants as recently as in the 1960s, legal limits are typically 30 mg/m3 today, and much lower levels are achievable. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) The clinker burning process is a high- temperature process resulting in the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The amount formed is directly related to the main flame temperature (typically 1850‚Äì2000 ¬∞C). Nitrogen monoxide (NO) accounts for about 95%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for about 5% of this compound present in the exhaust gas of rotary kiln plants. As most of the NO is converted to NO2 in the atmosphere, emissions are given as NO2 per cubic metre exhaust gas. Without reduction measures, process-related NOx contents in the exhaust gas of rotary kiln plants would in most cases considerably exceed the specifications of e.g. European legislation for waste burning plants (0.50 g/m3 for new plants and 0.80 g/m3 for existing plants). Reduction measures are aimed at smoothing and optimising plant operation. Technically, staged combustion and Selective Non- Catalytic NO Reduction (SNCR) are applied to cope with the emission limit values. High process temperatures are required to convert the raw material mix to Portland cement clinker. Kiln charge temperatures in the sintering zone of rotary kilns range at around 1450 ¬∞C. To reach these, flame temperatures of about 2000 ¬∞C are necessary. For reasons of clinker quality the burning process takes place under oxidising conditions, under which the partial oxidation of the molecular nitrogen in the combustion air resulting in the formation of nitrogen monoxide (NO) dominates. This reaction is also called thermal NO formation. At the lower temperatures prevailing in a precalciner, however, thermal NO formation is negligible: here, the nitrogen bound in the fuel can result in the formation of what is known as fuel-related NO. Staged combustion is used to reduce NO: calciner fuel is added with insufficient combustion air. This causes CO to form. The CO then reduces the NO into molecular nitrogen: :2 CO + 2 NO ‚Üí 2 CO2 \\\\+ N2. Hot tertiary air is then added to oxidize the remaining CO. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) Sulfur is input into the clinker burning process via raw materials and fuels. Depending on their origin, the raw materials may contain sulfur bound as sulfide or sulfate. Higher SO2 emissions by rotary kiln systems in the cement industry are often attributable to the sulfides contained in the raw material, which become oxidised to form SO2 at the temperatures between 370 ¬∞C and 420 ¬∞C prevailing in the kiln preheater. Most of the sulfides are pyrite or marcasite contained in the raw materials. Given the sulfide concentrations found e.g. in German raw material deposits, SO2 emission concentrations can total up to 1.2 g/m3 depending on the site location. In some cases, injected calcium hydroxide is used to lower SO2 emissions. The sulfur input with the fuels is completely converted to SO2 during combustion in the rotary kiln. In the preheater and the kiln, this SO2 reacts to form alkali sulfates, which are bound in the clinker, provided that oxidizing conditions are maintained in the kiln. Carbon monoxide (CO) and total carbon The exhaust gas concentrations of CO and organically bound carbon are a yardstick for the burn-out rate of the fuels utilised in energy conversion plants, such as power stations. By contrast, the clinker burning process is a material conversion process that must always be operated with excess air for reasons of clinker quality. In concert with long residence times in the high-temperature range, this leads to complete fuel burn-up. The emissions of CO and organically bound carbon during the clinker burning process are caused by the small quantities of organic constituents input via the natural raw materials (remnants of organisms and plants incorporated in the rock in the course of geological history). These are converted during kiln feed preheating and become oxidized to form CO and CO2. In this process, small portions of organic trace gases (total organic carbon) are formed as well. In case of the clinker burning process, the content of CO and organic trace gases in the clean gas therefore may not be directly related to combustion conditions. The amount of released CO2 is about half a ton per ton of clinker. Dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) Rotary kilns of the cement industry and classic incineration plants mainly differ in terms of the combustion conditions prevailing during clinker burning. Kiln feed and rotary kiln exhaust gases are conveyed in counter-flow and mixed thoroughly. Thus, temperature distribution and residence time in rotary kilns afford particularly favourable conditions for organic compounds, introduced either via fuels or derived from them, to be completely destroyed. For that reason, only very low concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (colloquially \\"dioxins and furans\\") can be found in the exhaust gas from cement rotary kilns. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) The emission behaviour of PCB is comparable to that of dioxins and furans. PCB may be introduced into the process via alternative raw materials and fuels. The rotary kiln systems of the cement industry destroy these trace components virtually completely. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) PAHs (according to EPA 610) in the exhaust gas of rotary kilns usually appear at a distribution dominated by naphthalene, which accounts for a share of more than 90% by mass. The rotary kiln systems of the cement industry destroy virtually completely the PAHs input via fuels. Emissions are generated from organic constituents in the raw material. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) As a rule benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are present in the exhaust gas of rotary kilns in a characteristic ratio. BTEX is formed during the thermal decomposition of organic raw material constituents in the preheater. Gaseous inorganic chlorine compounds (HCl) Chlorides are a minor additional constituents contained in the raw materials and fuels of the clinker burning process. They are released when the fuels are burnt or the kiln feed is heated, and primarily react with the alkalis from the kiln feed to form alkali chlorides. These compounds, which are initially vaporous, condense on the kiln feed or the kiln dust, at temperatures between 700 ¬∞C and 900 ¬∞C, subsequently re-enter the rotary kiln system and evaporate again. This cycle in the area between the rotary kiln and the preheater can result in coating formation. A bypass at the kiln inlet allows effective reduction of alkali chloride cycles and to diminish coating build-up problems. During the clinker burning process, gaseous inorganic chlorine compounds are either not emitted at all or in very small quantities only. Gaseous inorganic fluorine compounds (HF) Of the fluorine present in rotary kilns, 90 to 95% is bound in the clinker, and the remainder is bound with dust in the form of calcium fluoride stable under the conditions of the burning process. Ultra-fine dust fractions that pass through the measuring gas filter may give the impression of low contents of gaseous fluorine compounds in rotary kiln systems of the cement industry. Trace elements The emission behaviour of the individual elements in the clinker burning process is determined by the input scenario, the behaviour in the plant and the precipitation efficiency of the dust collection device. The trace elements introduced into the burning process via the raw materials and fuels may evaporate completely or partially in the hot zones of the preheater and/or rotary kiln depending on their volatility, react with the constituents present in the gas phase, and condense on the kiln feed in the cooler sections of the kiln system. Depending on the volatility and the operating conditions, this may result in the formation of cycles that are either restricted to the kiln and the preheater or include the combined drying and grinding plant as well. Trace elements from the fuels initially enter the combustion gases, but are emitted to an extremely small extent only owing to the retention capacity of the kiln and the preheater. Under the conditions prevailing in the clinker burning process, non-volatile elements (e.g. arsenic, vanadium, nickel) are completely bound in the clinker. Elements such as lead and cadmium preferentially react with the excess chlorides and sulfates in the section between the rotary kiln and the preheater, forming volatile compounds. Owing to the large surface area available, these compounds condense on the kiln feed particles at temperatures between 700 ¬∞C and 900 ¬∞C. In this way, the volatile elements accumulated in the kiln-preheater system are precipitated again in the cyclone preheater, remaining almost completely in the clinker. Thallium (as the chloride) condenses in the upper zone of the cyclone preheater at temperatures between 450 ¬∞C and 500 ¬∞C. As a consequence, a cycle can be formed between preheater, raw material drying and exhaust gas purification. Mercury and its compounds are not precipitated in the kiln and the preheater. They condense on the exhaust gas route due to the cooling of the gas and are partially adsorbed by the raw material particles. This portion is precipitated in the kiln exhaust gas filter. Owing to trace element behaviour during the clinker burning process and the high precipitation efficiency of the dust collection devices, trace element emission concentrations are on a low overall level.

A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a de facto art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities. History In 1989, the Helsinki Festival established its Night of the Arts, \\"when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue\\". A year later, the mayor of Nantes, Jean-Marc Ayrault's program included renovating the central city and establishing a \\"contemporary patrimony\\", which led arts programmer Jean Blaise to create a late-night cultural festival, \\"Les Allum√©es\\" (\\"Things Alight\\").Alliance Fran√ßaise of New Zealand, May 2009 Newsletter His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6 pm to 6 am, over six years with artists from six cities.Les Allum√©es (in French) They were as follows: * Barcelona, 15‚Äì20 October 1990 * St. Petersburg, 14‚Äì19 October 1991 * Buenos Aires, 19‚Äì24 October 1992 * Naples, 18‚Äì23 October 1993 * Cairo, 17‚Äì22 October 1994 * Havana, 16‚Äì21 October 1995. (The Cuban government refused to issue travel documents to the 300 artists expected, so the event was formally cancelled, though events did take place.) In 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allum√©es, the annual White Nights Festival in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the Scarlet Sails celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included pop culture (e.g. the Rolling Stones in the open air at Palace Square) in 2007 and high culture events (\\"Stars of the White Nights Festival\\" at the Mariinsky Theatre under Valery Gergiev) every year since 1993. In 1997, the Long Night of Museums, took place in the newly re-united Berlin with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night. In 2001, when Bertrand Delano√´ became Mayor of Paris, his deputy, Christophe Girard, invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born.History of Nuit Blanche (in French) The concept of Les Allum√©es was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. \\"The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since.\\" The idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as \\"Nuits Blanches Europe\\". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates. In 2013, Melbourne hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, laneways, shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport.Premier of Victoria's Press Release: White Night Melbourne ‚Äì celebrating our city from dusk to dawn This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia. Continuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community. In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the \\"Noche en Blanco\\" was made between 2013 and 2015.

The Canton of Fribourg school system provides one year of non- obligatory Kindergarten, followed by six years of Primary school. This is followed by three years of obligatory lower Secondary school where the students are separated according to ability and aptitude. Following the lower Secondary students may attend a three or four year optional upper Secondary school. The upper Secondary school is divided into gymnasium (university preparatory) and vocational programs. After they finish the upper Secondary program, students may choose to attend a Tertiary school or continue their apprenticeship.Chart of the education system in Canton Fribourg During the 2010-11 school year, there were a total of 14 students attending one class in Grangettes.

It was released under the title Innocence is Bliss in the UK. Plot For Ellen Grant, the worst student at the Woodruff Secretarial School, it comes as a great surprise when Dick Richmond hires her to work at his realty company. Actually, it is her apparent empty-headedness that has won her the job. The real estate firm, and now Ellen, are merely fronts for a bookmaking operation run from the back of the office, where Dick and his associates, Gleason and Kilcoyne, take bets on races. Ellen is distressed when she watches as her uncle, Judge Ben Grant, is forced to rule in favor of landlord Roscoe Johnson in eviction proceedings against several of her friends. There is an acute shortage of low-cost housing, exacerbated by Johnson's plans to tear down what he has and rebuild more expensive units. To avoid raising Ellen's suspicions, Dick mentions that he cannot purchase some land offered because $60,000 is too high a price, but that he would for $55,000. Ellen goes to the vendors without authorization and negotiates the price down to $50,000. When she returns to the office with the news, accompanied by the seller and Ellen's boyfriend, Assistant District Attorney Ralph Winton, Dick has to play along. Little does she know her plans to construct affordable housing are driving Dick's organization into financial trouble. He cannot fire her without questions being asked, so he tries being aggressively romantic with her. This backfires, however: both he and Ellen find themselves enjoying embracing and kissing. Young widow Mrs. Peggy Donato comes to see her old flame, Dick, to try to get him to run her much larger bookmaking operation (inherited from her late husband). She and Ellen soon detest each other. Dick's trouble really begins when Ellen unwittingly takes a bet from Mrs. Donato on a fixed race, putting Dick in debt to her for $50,000. Mrs. Donato, who would rather have Dick than the winnings, tells him that if he does not go away with her or pay her, her gang will deal with him. To raise the money, Dick lets Ellen take charge of the housing development, having Kilcoyne embezzle enough funds from down payments on the new homes. When the funds run out before the homes are built, she accepts full responsibility, believing that her own incompetence was to blame. Seeing the girl he has come to love suffer, Dick decides to go away with Mrs. Donato and pay the people back. Ellen discovers the truth behind the missing money and the betting racket, but forgives Dick and cooks up a scheme to force Mrs. Donato to leave Dick alone, pretending to be the brains behind the bookmaking operation, backed by her own \\"gang\\". Peggy's men, however, are too tough. Just in time, Gleason and Kilcoyne show up with the $50,000, won by a bet placed with Mrs. Donato's own organization. Dick and Ellen embrace. Cast Notes Ball was at the peak of her pre-television movie career. In the late 1940s, Ball had a string of hit comedies such as Sorrowful Jones with Bob Hope and The Fuller Brush Girl (1950) with Eddie Albert, her first major release showcasing her talent for physical comedy. It would be two years before her super-stardom on television in I Love Lucy. William Holden's career, like Ball's, would mushroom in the 1950s. He was just a year away from filming the blockbuster Sunset Boulevard. Miss Grant Takes Richmond was well received by critics and movie-goers in 1949.

It was one of two long-distance services on the T≈çkaid≈ç- Sany≈ç corridor. The other train on the route, named Sakura, was aimed at middle-class travelers, while Fuji had higher-class rooms, dining cars serving Western food and a \\"Momoyama\\" observation car. Fuji and Sakura were the first named trains in Japan. Fuji services originally operated between Tokyo and Shimonoseki Station. Connecting ferries were available from Shimonoseki to Pusan, Korea, from which passengers could connect to train services bound for China, Russia, and even Europe. In November 1942, service was extended to Nagasaki, from where ferries were available to Shanghai. Fuji services were suspended in April 1944 due to Japan's deteriorating situation in World War II. Post-World War II A 151 series EMU on a Fuji service The Fuji name was briefly used on a Shinjuku - Kawaguchiko service (Ch≈´≈ç Main Line) in 1950, but did not return to the Tokaido corridor until 1 October 1961, when the Fuji service resumed as a daytime limited express between Tokyo and Kobe using 151 series EMUs. After the Tokaido Shinkansen opened on 1 October 1964, the Fuji became a Tokyo-≈åita sleeper service using 20 series sleeping cars. Between 1965 and 1980, the service was extended to Nishi-Kagoshima Station, becoming the longest train service in Japanese history: the Tokyo-Kagoshima run took over 24 hours (departing Tokyo at 18:00 and arriving Nishi-Kagoshima at 18:03). From 1980 to 1997, the Fuji operated between Tokyo and Miyazaki (Miyazaki Station or Minami-Miyazaki Station). Dining car service was discontinued from March 1993. The final Hayabusa and Fuji sleeping car service after arriving at Tokyo Station, 14 March 2009 From 1 March 2005, the Fuji was combined with the Hayabusa service between Tokyo and Moji, following the discontinuation of the Sakura service which previously operated in conjunction with the Hayabusa. Finally, the Fuji was discontinued in its entirety from the start of the revised timetable on 14 March 2009, due to declining ridership. Rolling stock The train was formed of 14 series sleeping cars based at JR Kyushu's Kumamoto Depot, typically consisting of six cars in the Hayabusa portion and six cars in the Fuji portion. The train was hauled by a JR West Class EF66 electric locomotive between Tokyo and Shimonoseki, a JR Kyushu Class EF81-400 electric locomotive between Shimonoseki and Moji (through the undersea Kanmon Tunnel), and by a JR Kyushu Class ED76 electric locomotive from Moji to ≈åita.\\"Ôº™Ôº≤Êñ∞ÂππÁ∑öÔºÜÁâπÊÄ•ÂàóËªä„Éï„Ç°„Ç§„É´\\" (JR Shinkansen & Limited Express Train File), published 2008 by K≈çts≈´ Shimbun Gallery File:Fuji Train6.jpg|Beds (March 2009) File:Fuji Train5.jpg|Passageway (March 2009) File:Fuji (Japanese sleeper train) B1-class Car Entrance.jpg|Entrance of a car (November 2008) File:Fuji (Japanese sleeper train) B-class Car Washstand.jpg|Washstand (November 2008) File:Fuji (Japanese sleeper train) B-class Car Toilet.jpg|Toilet (November 2008) See also * Blue Train (Japan) References External links * Hayabusa & Fuji train information * JR Kyushu website Category:Kyushu Railway Company Category:Named passenger trains of Japan Category:Night trains of Japan Category:Railway services introduced in 1929 Category:Railway services discontinued in 2009 ","title":"Fuji (train)"},{"id":"7241107","text":"\\"Teriazoume\\" (Greek script: \\"Œ§Œ±ŒπœÅŒπŒ¨Œ∂ŒøœÖŒºŒµ\\", English translation: \\"We're alike\\") was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992, performed in Greek by Evridiki.

One of Chester Anderson's early little magazines, satirizing the beatnik coffee house scene in North Beach. Chester Valentine John Anderson (August 11, 1932 - April 11, 1991) was a novelist, poet, and editor in the underground press. Raised in Florida, he attended the University of Miami from 1952 to 1956, before becoming a beatnik coffee house poet in Greenwich Village and San Francisco's North Beach. As a poet, he wrote under the name C.V.J. Anderson and edited the little magazines Beatitude and Underhound. In journalism, he specialized in rock and roll. In that area, he was a friend of Paul Williams and edited Crawdaddy! for a few issues in 1968-1969. He also wrote science fiction, because of Michael Kurland. Anderson's The Butterfly Kid is the first part of what is called the Greenwich Village Trilogy, with Kurland writing the second book (The Unicorn Girl) and the third volume (The Probability Pad) written by T.A. Waters. The novel was nominated for the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It, and his few other genre works are associated with New Wave science fiction. He was also a gifted musician, played two part inventions with two recorders simultaneously, played duets with Laurence M. Janifer at the Cafe Rienzi. He subsequently moved to San Francisco during the Summer of Love and, along with Claude Hayward, was one of the founders of the Communications Company (ComCo), the \\"publishing arm\\" of the anarchist guerrilla street theater group The Diggers, having bought a mimeograph with his second royalty check from Butterfly Kid.Anderson, Chester. \\"Letter To Thurl\\" Chester Anderson (1932- ) Papers (ca. 1963-1980).

After his stint with Crawadaddy! he was connected for a brief period with the underground newspaper Tuesday's Child and with Peace Press, a small movement print shop in Los Angeles. He published two works, both of them thinly disguised memoirs (one under the pseudonym John Valentine) with Paul Williams's Entwhistle Books. Prior to his death in 1991, he lived for a number of years in Mendocino, California, where he collaborated with local artist Charles Marchant Stevenson on his book Fox and Hare: The Story of a Friday Evening. A number of science fiction and publishing personalities, including Norman Spinrad and Lou Stathis, posed on location for the illustrations in this book, which attempted to recreate a particular evening in Greenwich Village in the 1960s.

Mechanism  The process of ERAD can be divided into three steps:  Recognition of misfolded or mutated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  The recognition of misfolded or mutated proteins depends on the detection of substructures within proteins such as exposed hydrophobic regions, unpaired cysteine residues and immature glycans. In mammalian cells for example, there exists a mechanism called glycan processing. In this mechanism, the lectin- type chaperones calnexin/calreticulin (CNX/CRT) provide immature glycoproteins the opportunity to reach their native conformation. They can do this by way of reglucosylating these glycoproteins by an enzyme called UDP-glucose- glycoprotein glucosyltransferase also known as UGGT. Terminally misfolded proteins, however, must be extracted from CNX/CRT. This is carried out by members of the EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing Œ±-mannosidase-like protein) family (EDEM1-3) and ER mannosidase I. This mannosidase removes one mannose residue from the glycoprotein and the latter is recognized by EDEM. Eventually EDEM will target the misfolded glycoproteins for degradation by facilitating binding of ERAD lectins OS9 and XTP3-B.  Retro-translocation into the cytosol  Because the ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome system (UPS) is located in the cytosol, terminally misfolded proteins have to be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum back into cytoplasm. Most evidence suggest that the Hrd1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase can function as a retrotranslocon or dislocon to transport substrates into the cytosol. Hrd1 is not required for all ERAD events, so it is likely that other proteins contribute to this process. For example, glycosylated substrates are recognized by the E3 Fbs2 lectin. Further, this translocation requires a driving force that determines the direction of transport. Since polyubiquitination is essential for the export of substrates, it is widely thought that this driving force is provided by ubiquitin-binding factors. One of these ubiquitin-binding factors is the Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p complex in yeast. Humans have the homolog of Cdc48p known as valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) with the same function as Cdc48p. VCP/p97 transports substrates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm with its ATPase activity.  Ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome  The ubiquitination of terminally misfolded proteins is caused by a cascade of enzymatic reactions. The first of these reactions takes place when the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 hydrolyses ATP and forms a high-energy thioester linkage between a cysteine residue in its active site and the C-terminus of ubiquitin. The resulting activated ubiquitin is then passed to E2, which is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Another group of enzymes, more specifically ubiquitin protein ligases called E3, bind to the misfolded protein. Next they align the protein and E2, thus facilitating the attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues of the misfolded protein. Following successive addition of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues of the previously attached ubiquitin, a polyubiquitin chain is formed. A polyubiquitinated protein is produced and this is recognized by specific subunits in the 19S capping complexes of the 26S proteasome. Hereafter, the polypeptide chain is fed into the central chamber of the 20S core region that contains the proteolytically active sites. Ubiquitin is cleaved before terminal digestion by deubiquitinating enzymes. This third step is very closely associated with the second one, since ubiquitination takes place during the translocation event. However, the proteasomal degradation takes place in the cytoplasm.  ERAD ubiquitination machinery  The ER membrane anchored RING finger containing ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10 are the major mediators of substrate ubiquitination during ERAD. The tail anchored membrane protein Ubc6 as well as Ubc1 and the Cue1 dependent membrane bound Ubc7 are the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes involved in ERAD.  Checkpoints  As the variation of ERAD- substrates is enormous, several variations of the ERAD mechanism have been proposed. Indeed, it was confirmed that soluble, membrane and transmembrane proteins were recognized by different mechanisms. This led to the identification of 3 different pathways that constitute in fact 3 checkpoints. *The first checkpoint is called ERAD-C and monitors the folding state of the cytosolic domains of membrane proteins. If defects are detected in the cytosolic domains, this checkpoint will remove the misfolded protein. *When the cytosolic domains are found to be correctly folded, the membrane protein will pass to a second checkpoint where the luminal domains are monitored. This second checkpoint is called the ERAD-L pathway. Not only membrane proteins surviving the first checkpoint are controlled for their luminal domains, also soluble proteins are inspected by this pathway as they are entirely luminal and thus bypass the first checkpoint. If a lesion in the luminal domains is detected, the involved protein is processed for ERAD using a set of factors including the vesicular trafficking machinery that transports misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. *Also a third checkpoint has been described that relies on the inspection of transmembrane domains of proteins. It is called the ERAD-M pathway but it is not very clear in which order it has to be placed with regard to the two previously described pathways.  Diseases associated with ERAD-malfunctioning  As ERAD is a central element of the secretory pathway, disorders in its activity can cause a range of human diseases. These disorders can be classified into two groups. The first group is the result of mutations in ERAD components, which subsequently lose their function. By losing their function, these components are no longer able to stabilize aberrant proteins, so that the latter accumulate and damage the cell. An example of a disease caused by this first group of disorders is Parkinson's disease. It is caused by a mutation in the parkin gene. Parkin is a protein that functions in complex with CHIP as a ubiquitin ligase and overcomes the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins. [There are numerous theories addressing the causes of Parkinson's disease, besides the one presented here. Many of these can be found in the section of Wikipedia devoted to Parkinson's disease.] In contrast to this first group of disorders, the second group is caused by premature degradation of secretory or membrane proteins. In this way, these proteins aren't able to be deployed to distal compartments, as is the case in cystic fibrosis.  ERAD and HIV  As described before, the addition of polyubiquitin chains to ERAD substrates is crucial for their export. HIV uses an efficient mechanism to dislocate a single-membrane-spanning host protein, CD4, from the ER and submits it to ERAD. The Vpu protein of HIV-1 is a protein on the ER membrane and targets newly made CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum for degradation by cytosolic proteasomes. Vpu only utilizes part of the ERAD process to degrade CD4. CD4 is normally a stable protein and is not likely to be a target for ERAD. However, HIV produces the membrane protein Vpu that binds to CD4. The Vpu protein mainly retains the CD4 in the ER by SCFŒ≤-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions. The CD4 Gly415 is a contributor to CD4-Vpu interactions, several TMD-mediated mechanisms by HIV-1 Vpu are necessary to downregulate CD4 and thus promote viral pathogenesis. CD4 retained in the ER will be a target for a variant ERAD pathway rather than predominantly appearing at the plasma membrane without the presence of Vpu through the RESET pathway. Vpu mediates the CD4 retention in the ER and the addition of degradation. As Vpu is phosphorylated, it mimics substrates for the E3 complex SCFŒ≤TrCP. In cells that are infected with HIV, SCFŒ≤TrCP interacts with Vpu and ubiquitinates CD4, which is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Vpu itself escapes from the degradation.  Questions  The big open questions related to ERAD are: * How are misfolded proteins more specifically recognized? * How ERAD substrates/luminal substrates and membrane substrates are differentiated for retrotranslocation? * Is the retrotranslocation conserved across the yeast to human system? * What is the channel for the retrotranslocation of luminal ER proteins? * Which E3 ligase finally tags the proteins for the proteasomal degradation?

In 2002, Paideuma broadened its focus, changing its subtitle to \\"Studies in American and British Modernism.\\" Since 1978, when NPF published its first collection of poetry, the works of such poets as Carl Rakosi, Thomas Parkinson, and Kenneth Fearing have appeared. As well, NPF has published the influential anthology of Language poets, In the American Tree, edited by Ron Silliman. The National Poetry Foundation also publishes the Man/Woman and Poet Series. Begun in 1979, it has devoted critical and bibliographical attention to British and American poets. In 1982, NPF initiated the scholarly journal Sagetrieb: A Journal Devoted to Poets in the Imagist/Objectivist Tradition. In 2002, Sagetrieb changed its subtitle to \\"Poetry and Poetics after Modernism.\\" Finally, NPF has regularly hosted international conferences on modern poetry, including three conferences devoted to Ezra Pound (1975, 1980, and 1985) and conferences on William Carlos Williams (1983), H.D. (1986), Marianne Moore (1987), T.S. Eliot (1988), Pound and Yeats (1990), American Poets of the 1930s (1993), and in 1996 American Poets of the 1950s. Speakers at these conferences have included some of the better known scholars working in the field of modern poetry. Hugh Kenner was a featured speaker at all the NPF conferences from 1975 through 1993, for example. Featured speakers in 1996 included Marjorie Perloff, M. L. Rosenthal, Albert Gelpi, Robert Von Hallberg, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Charles Altieri, Jerome Rothenberg, Armand Schwerner, Theodore Enslin, Ed Dorn, Alicia Ostriker, and others.

He was in charge of the Batall√≥n de Inteligencia 601. Biography Born in Buenos Aires, he enrolled at the National War College in 1944, and took an interest in national politics before his 1948 graduation. A magnetic and charismatic figure, he was involved at that time in several liaisons with prominent women, through whom he invariably furthered his interests; he took little or no interest, however, in the children reported at that time to have been fathered by him. Su√°rez Mason took part in a failed military coup against the populist President Juan Per√≥n in 1951. He was forced to retreat to Uruguay, and later collaborated with the overthrow of Per√≥n in 1955. He was received back in Buenos Aires with honours following the coup's success on September 19.La Naci√≥n: Falleci√≥ ayer el ex general Su√°rez Mason Su√°rez Mason taught at the School of Higher War Studies, and rose in rank, becoming a military attach√© to the Argentine Embassy in Ecuador in 1971, and a director of military intelligence in 1972. He was attached to the Operativo Independencia counterinsurgency mission in 1975, and upon the March 1976 coup against President Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, was appointed Commander of the First Army Corps, a unit whose principal duty was to garrison the capital. During the subsequent dictatorship, Su√°rez Mason had purview over a number of the most notorious detention centers (among the over 300 such facilities that led to the disappearance of between 8,000 and 30,000 people. Those under his command included Automotores Orletti, Pozo de Banfield, La Cacha, and El Olimpo. He also supervised Polic√≠a Bonaerense Chief Ram√≥n Camps, as well as Army Intelligence Battalion 601, which carried out numerous extortions and kidnappings for ransom.Andersen, Martin. Dossier secreto. Westview Press, 1993. He financed Cabildo, a far-right Catholic publication known at the time for its espousal of anti-semitism, and relaunched the previously banned publication. Su√°rez Mason earned a reputation as a hard-line figure in the regime, particularly after steps toward political liberalization began in 1979, and fell out of favor with the president, General Jorge Videla, after the latter's cancellation of Operation Soberan√≠a (the aborted 1978 invasion of neighboring Chile, at the height of the Beagle Conflict). Su√°rez Mason was relieved of his post at the First Army Corps in January 1980, and made Chairman of the Joint Military Chiefs. He oversaw Argentine tactical support for the July 1980 \\"Cocaine Coup\\" in Bolivia, and later chaired the Latin American chapter of the World Anti-Communist League. He was appointed Director of the state oil concern, YPF, by President Leopoldo Galtieri in December 1981, and in 1983, at the end of his tenure, the company recorded a US$6 billion annual loss (the largest in the world at the time).The Guinness Book of World Records.

He fled to the United States with a false passport, however, and took up residence in Miami. He was stripped of rank and ordered arrested by President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n on charges related to a putative 1985 plot to overthrow the democratic government. Pursuant to an Interpol order, however, he was arrested in Foster City, California in January 1987,New York Times: Argentine office is arrested and on May 9, 1988, extradited to Buenos Aires to face charges of murdering 43 people and kidnapping a further 23, including newborn babies.Clar√≠n: Trajeron a Su√°rez Mason. 10 May 1988. Convicted for these crimes, he was pardoned by President Carlos Menem in 1990, and fled to California. He was again extradited in 1995, and was prosecuted by Luis Moreno Ocampo on charges of crimes against humanity for the kipnapping of minors. He was later placed under house arrest, and in 2000, was condemned to life imprisonment in absentia by Italian courts for the murder of eight Italian Argentines.Clar√≠n: Condenaron a prisi√≥n perpetua en Italia a Su√°rez Mason y Riveros Although prisoners aged over 70 are usually kept under house arrest in Argentina, he would be reimprisoned in 2004 after abusing the terms of his detention.

Life Henshall was born in Manchester. Leaving school at the age of sixteen, Henry - he preferred his second forename to that of John - attended the Manchester School of Art, where he was taught by William Jabez Muckley, who was a talented but demanding master. In March 1876 he travelled to London to join the South Kensington School of Art, but he remained there only one term, passing in the following June to the Royal Academy on the special recommendation of Edward Poynter. In 1880 he was awarded a Royal Academy silver medal for a Painting of a Head from the Life, almost certainly the fine watercolour An Egyptian Muleteer now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Although Henshall did paint some oils he was principally a watercolourist, being elected an Associate of the RWS in 1883, and becoming one of the Society's forty full members in 1897. He exhibited 171 pictures at the RWS and his diploma work, La Serenata, may be viewed at the Society's Bankside gallery. A favourite theme of Henshall's work is the contrast between the happy innocence of childhood, without cares, and the tribulations of old age. He was not afraid to tackle uncomfortable subjects and his honest, realistic pictures of ordinary life were quite unusual for painters in the Victorian era. In April 1912 the Leicester Galleries in London had an exhibition of Henshall's watercolours of Country Folk (catalogue No. 162).

The elephants form the core of the Mysore Dasara procession on the Vijayadashami day. The lead elephant carries the Golden Howdah (Chinnada Ambari) with the Goddess Chamundeshwari in it. The Golden Howdah weighs 750 Kilograms in weight and is purely made of gold. Arrival The Elephants start arriving to Mysore city in groups. They arrive to Mysore a month or so before the start of the actual festivities and they undergo practice for their march on the final day. The elephants are accompanied by their respective keepers or Mahouts. The elephants are usually brought in trucks and are occasionally walked the 70-km distance from their home base in the Nagarahole National Park to Mysore. Villagers greet the sacred animals all along their designated trekking route. As each party of pachyderms arrives at the Veerana Hosahalli forest checkpost in Hunsur taluk, from the forest, they are received by the District Minister, a host of officials and prominent persons from Mysore and people from nearby villages. The villagers perform folk dances, and beat drums and sing songs to welcome the elephants. This in keeping with the royal tradition of the Mysore Maharajas. Royal feast While in their respective camps the elephants are served 'Ragi mudde', a mixture of ragi and horse gram and fodder branches. But when they are royal guests in the royal city of Mysore preparing for Dasara, they are served with ‚Äòroyal‚Äô food till the grand Dasara finale - Jamboo Savari. The elephants get to eat uddina bele (black gram), green gram, wheat, boiled rice, onion and vegetables in the mornings and evenings. They get rice, groundnut, coconut, jaggery and sugarcane with some salt to add taste to the diet after they return from their regular rehearsals. This food is served twice a day. They also get branch fodder like banyan leaves. Extra care is taken while serving food to the jumbos. High-calorie and protein-rich food is served to the elephants to improve their physical fitness. They carry a lot of weight at the procession and for that, they need strength. Hence they are fed with rich food. The food served in the morning is laced with pure butter for flavour. Besides nutritious food, vitamin doses are also injected so as to balance the diet. An elephant eats 400 kilograms of fodder in a day in the forests. The food served to them in Mysore contains high calories and is more than what they eat in the jungles. Choosing the elephants An elephant chosen to lead the Dasara parade The Dasara Elephants are usually caught by the elephant trainers via the Khedda operation. During the Wodeyar rule, the elephants thus caught were inspected in an open field for strength, personality, and character. The walking styles, weaknesses to seduction, the facial charisma were some of the factors considered for selection. Then the chosen elephants were trained for the festival. It is said that the king himself would oversee the training. Sometimes abandoned young elephants are also trained for dasara. The abode The abode of the elephants during the rest of the year is usually their training camps and the surrounding National Parks. There are around 70 tamed elephants in exclusive camps at Dubare, Hebballa, Moorkal, Kallalla, Nagarahole, Veeranahosahalli, Metikuppe, Sunkadakatte, Bandipur, Moolehole, K. Gudi and Bheemeshwari. About 240 mahouts and kavadis take care of the needs of these elephants and develop a bond with them. The elephants The elephants are named in Kannada and usually have the names of Hindu gods and historical figures. Elephants Drona and Balarama carried the idol of deity Chamundeshwari housed in the Golden Howdah for a combined total of 30 years. Balarama took up the responsibility after Drona was electrocuted in 1998 at Nagarahole National Park. Balarama has been granted retirement after 13 years. The 52-year-old Arjuna replaced Balarama and carried the Golden Howdah during the Dasara 2012 Jamboo Sawari procession at Mysore on 24 October 2012. The other elephants participating in the event are Bharatha, Kanthi, Gayathri, Kokila, Sri Rama, Abhimanyu, Gajendra, Biligiriranga, Vikram, Varalakshmi, and Sarojini. Controversy The Dasara procession has faced increasing pressure from activists and campaigners to end its controversial use of elephants. Procession elephants, as well as their handlers known as ‚Äòmahouts‚Äô, have died from several shocking incidents over the years. In 2018, leaked footage from the elephants‚Äô training ground showed an elephant swaying in distress. International press labelled the video ‚Äúheartbreaking‚Äù, and reported on how the elephants must undergo two months of ‚Äúrigorous training‚Äù in order to perform in the procession.

Pieces using sonata form typically use the recapitulation to conclude a piece, providing closure through the repetition of thematic material from the exposition in the tonic key. In all musical forms other techniques include \\"altogether unexpected digressions just as a work is drawing to its close, followed by a return...to a consequently more emphatic confirmation of the structural relations implied in the body of the work.\\"Perle, George (1990). The Listening Composer. California: University of California Press. . For example: * The slow movement of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, where a \\"diminished-7th chord progression interrupts the final cadence.\\" * The slow movement of Symphony No. 5 by Beethoven, where, \\"echoing afterthoughts\\", follow the initial statements of the first theme and only return expanded in the coda. * Var√®se's Density 21.5, where partitioning of the chromatic scale into (two) whole tone scales provides the missing tritone of b implied in the previously exclusive partitioning by (three) diminished seventh chords. Coda Coda (Italian for \\"tail\\", plural code) is a term used in music in a number of different senses, primarily to designate a passage which brings a piece (or one movement thereof) to a conclusion. Outro An outro (sometimes \\"outtro\\", also \\"extro\\") is the opposite of an intro. \\"Outro\\" is a blend as it replaces the element \\"in\\" of the \\"intro\\" with its opposite, to create a new word. The term is typically used only in the realm of popular music. It can refer to the concluding track of an album or to an outro-solo, an instrumental solo (usually a guitar solo) played as the song fades out or until it stops. Examples * \\"Purple Rain\\" as recorded by Prince is an excellent example of an outro-solo, as is \\"Hotel California\\" as recorded by The Eagles. * \\"Jeremy\\" as recorded by Pearl Jam. * \\"Outro\\" ‚Äì The final track of the M83 album Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. * \\"Drugs\\" by Talking Heads Repeat and fade Repeat and fade is a musical direction used in sheet music when more than one repeat of the last few measures or so of a piece is desired with a fade-out (like something traveling into the distance and disappearing) as the manner in which to end the music. It originated as a sound effect made possible by the volume controls on sound recording equipment and on the sound controls for speaker output. No equivalent Italian term was in the standard lexicon of musical terms, so it was written in English, the language of the musician(s) who developed the technique. It is very difficult to approximate this effect on an instrument such as the piano, but instrumentalists can simulate it by thinning the musical texture while applying diminuendo within the limits of their instruments, and by taking advantage of the open-ended feeling of an unresolved harmony or melodic tone at the end. It is in the family of terms and signs that indicate repeated material, but it does not substitute for any of them, and it would be incorrect to describe it as a \\"shortcut\\" to any of the other repeat signs (such as Dal segno). The direction is to be taken literally: while repeating the music contained within the section annotated \\"repeat and fade\\", the player(s) should continue to play/repeat, and the mixer or player(s) should fade the volume while the player(s) repeat the appropriate musical segments, until the song has been faded out (usually by faders on the mixing board). Examples Repeat and fade endings are rarely found in live performances, but are often used in studio recordings. Examples include: * \\"Hey Jude\\" as recorded by The Beatles * \\"Time and a Word\\" as recorded by Yes See also *Da capo *Epilogue Sources Category:Formal sections in music analysis Category:Musical terminology Category:Jazz terminology ","title":"Conclusion (music)"},{"id":"7241385","text":"TC Matic was a Belgian rock band founded in 1980 in Brussels. Centered on singer Arno Hintjens and guitarist Jean-Marie Aerts, the band played a kind of music sometimes referred to as \\"eurorock\\", containing various styles including new wave, blues, funk, hard rock, avant-garde and French chanson. The band released four studio albums and attained a measure of commercial and popular success, and disbanded in 1986. History The band has its origin in the duo Tjens-Couter, composed of Arno Hintjens and guitarist Paul Decoutere,His last name is spelled variously, also as Decouter, Couter. which played rhythm and blues since the early 1970s, and in 1974 were augmented with Ferre Baelen (bass) and Rudy Cloet (drums), and in 1977 with Serge Feys (keyboards). Two albums were released, Who Cares (1975) and Plat du Jour (1978). In 1980, the group was renamed TC Matic after the Yugoslav surrealist poet Du≈°an Matiƒá. Decoutere was soon replaced by Jean-Marie Aerts, who cooperated with Hintjens in the majority of the band's compositions and produced the first three albums. Their debut album, TC Matic, was described as a mixture between Killing Joke and Gang of Four; they scored an early hit in Belgium with \\"Oh La La La\\" in 1981, and another with \\"Putain Putain\\" from 1983's Choco. In 1984, the Dutch bass player Michael Peet replaced Ferre Baelen. In 1985, the band toured Europe, opening for the Simple Minds, a tour which proved that Belgian bands could attain commercial success outside the country. A final album, Ye Ye (1985), was produced by Howard Gray. The band broke up in 1986. In 1985 Arno performed in the Konrad Boehmer opera 'Faust' at the Paris Operahouse 'Palais Garnier'. There may have been other TC Matic band members involved but could not confirm that. After the breakup Arno Hintjes started a solo career, under the name Arno. He continued to cooperate with Jean-Marie Aerts, who went on to work mainly as a producer (for Jo Lemaire and the Urban Dance Squad, among others), and with two other ex-TC Matic-members, drummer Rudy Cloet and keyboard player Serge Feys.

Prior to this, the Muslim presence on the island was itinerant. Conversion to Islam was not compulsory but the majority of the Catholic Latin population of the island, along with a smaller subsection of the Greek Orthodox population, converted to Islam for preferential tax status‚Äìas dictated by the Ottoman millet system. This tax system required a small payment and in return the citizens received protection from the state as well as other benefits. Before the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the Turkish Cypriots (the Muslim community of Cyprus) made up 18% of the island's population and lived throughout the island. Today, most of the estimated 264,172 Muslims are based in the north of the island. Turkish Cypriot society is markedly secular though, at least formally; adherents to the faith subscribe mostly to the Sunni branch, with an influential stream of Sufism underlying their spiritual heritage and development. Nazim al-Qubrusi, the leader of the Naqshbandi-Haqqani order, hailed from Larnaca and lived in Lefka. Another branch among the Turkish Cypriot Muslims is the Alevism.http://www.kktcakm.com There are a few Ahmadi Muslims in the country.  History  Islam came to Cyprus early on in the Arab conquests though a permanent presence only followed the Ottoman conquest in 1571. It is rumored that an aunt of Muhammad, Umm Haram, had accompanied one of the early Arab expeditions to the island. She died during the expedition and was buried at the present Hala Sultan Tekke monument. Since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the Muslim population in the north of the island has been bolstered by settlers from Turkey who are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims. The status of these settlers is disputed under international law and specifically the prohibition, under the Geneva Convention, on the cross-border transfer of populations by states aiming to engineer changes in the demographic make-up of other states. The segregation of Cypriot Turks and Greeks has effected that most of the Muslims in the territory controlled by the Republic of Cyprus are Arab immigrants and refugees, unrelated to the Turks historically living in the area.  Important landmarks  Several important Islamic shrines and landmarks exist on the island including: *the Arabahmet Mosque in Nicosia (built in the 16th century) *the Hala Sultan Tekke/Umm Haram Mosque in Larnaca (built in the 18th century) *the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque, Selimiye Mosque and the Haydarpasha Mosque; former Catholic cathedrals left from the Crusader era, which were meant to cater exclusively to the Catholic minority which ruled the island and were converted to mosques after the Muslim conquest in the Middle Ages.

The area is centered along Sakaisuji Avenue, extending from the Ebisu-ch≈ç Interchange of the Hanshin Expressway in the south, to Nansan-d≈çri (just east of Nankai Namba Station) in the north. Known colloquially as \\"Den-Den Town,\\" Nipponbashi is known for its many shops which specialize in furniture, tools, and \\"otaku\\" interests such as electronics, anime, manga, and collectibles. Nipponbashi is often compared to Akihabara Electric Town, its equivalent (in terms of focus) in Tokyo. Although written with the same characters Êó•Êú¨Ê©ã in Japanese, Nihonbashi in Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo is a different place and has a different pronunciation. History During the Edo period, this district was known as a , called . In 1792 and 1872, the Osaka municipal government renamed this district from Nagamachi to Nipponbashi. During the Meiji and Taish≈ç periods, many second-hand bookshops opened there. After World War II, many consumer electronics stores were opened, and it became well known as Den Den Town. The name \\"Nipponbashi\\" \\"Nipponbashi\\" most properly refers to the bridge of the same name, which crosses over the D≈çtonbori canal. However, the shopping district bearing the name of the bridge does not actually reach as far north as its namesake, though its northern areas are part of the \\"Nipponbashi\\" municipal designation (unlike Akihabara Electric Town which sits entirely apart from the origin of its name). Den Den Town , or is an alternate name for Nipponbashi, as it is famous for its wide variety of consumer electronics stores, and especially famous for its negotiable prices‚Äîunique to Osaka and the Kansai region. Several retailers are also tax- and duty-free. With the opening of Yodobashi Camera in Umeda and Bic Camera in Namba, Den Den Town saw a major fall-off in furniture and home-appliance sales, but has more recently become known as a haven for anime and otaku-related shopping, analogous to Tokyo's famous electronics district Akihabara. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Akihabara of West Japan\\", or by the phrase \\"Akiba in the East, 'Ponbashi in the West\\". Attractions Besides the usual large electronics retailers such as Joshin, Sofmap, etc. Nipponbashi is also host to numerous retailers of anime, manga, and other otaku-related goods such as Mandarake, Tora no Ana, and Osaka Gundams‚Äîa two-story all-Gundam outlet. The town also features numerous maid caf√©s and cosplay caf√©s. These include small and simple maid-themed coffee shops, maid-staffed massage and beautician services, and sit-down style full service cabarets. Transportation Ebisucho Station of the Sakaisuji Line, as well as the Nipponbashi Station of the Sakaisuji and Sennichimae lines both lead into Den Den Town.

When he entered a village, he would instantly start cleaning the gutters and roads of the village. He also told the citizens of the village that their congratulations would have to wait until his work was done. Villagers gave him money, babaji used that for progress of physical as well as thinking of society. From the obtained money, Maharaj built educational institutions, dharmashalas, hospitals and animal shelters.when he was a good personality He conducted his discourses in the form of \\"Kirtans\\" in which he would emphasize values like service to humanity and compassion. During his Kirtans, he would educate people against blind faiths and rituals. He would use Dohas (couplets of a song) by Saint Kabir in his discourses. He exhorted people to stop animal sacrifice as part of religious rituals and campaigned against vices such as alcohol abuse. He tried to embody the values that he preached: hard work, simple living and selfless service to the poor. He abandoned his family (a wife and three children) to pursue this path.G.N.

The reason for this was that the social reform work he was doing by preaching to the people through his \\"kirtan\\", Dr. Ambedkar was doing the same through politics. He was impressed by Babasaheb's personality and work. Gaadge Baba had donated the building of his hostel at Pandharpur to the People‚Äôs Education Society founded by Dr Ambedkar. He used to cite the example of Ambedkar while urging the people to get educated. \\"Look, how Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar became such a learned man by dint of sheer hard work.

He was the author of the controversial best selling book, Calories Don't Count. The FDA charged that the 1961 book, which cited a specific source of safflower oil capsules in the first printings, existed solely to promote the sales of safflower oil capsules. In 1962, FDA Commissioner George Larrick said: \\"This bestselling book was deliberately created and used to promote these worthless safflower oil capsules for the treatment of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and other serious conditions. One of its main purposes was to promote the sale of a commercial product in which Dr. Taller had a financial interest.\\" To this, publisher Simon & Schuster replied: \\"There is nothing in the record which could possibly support these vicious and irresponsible innuendoes.\\" The FDA's Larrick went further: \\"The book is full of false ideas, as many competent medical and nutritional writers have pointed out. Contrary to the book's basic premise, weight reduction requires the reduction of caloric intake. There is no easy, simple substitute. Unfortunately, calories do count.\\" Despite this, the book sold more than two million copies. Later, after a trial, and an unfavorable appeal on the confusion of the jury instructions about misdemeanors, Taller was found guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy in 1967, fined $7000, placed on probation for two years, and sentencing suspended on some charges. In the October 1962 pocket book edition of \\"Calories Don't Count\\" there is no mention of safflower oil capsules. Safflower oil is mentioned as the oil highest in polyunsaturated fat content at the time of writing. The main component of the diet is polyunsaturated fats; corn oil and sunflower oil are also suggested as good sources. The intake of oil recommended in the book is around 3-4 oz per day. \\"What got Taller into trouble with the law was that first printings of the book included an endorsement of a specific manufacturer of safflower oil (CDC capsules), and copies of the book were used to promote the capsules.\\" References Further reading *Stephen Barrett, William T.

Early life Brockedon was born at Totnes on 13 October 1787, son of a watchmaker. He was educated at a private school in Totnes, but learned more from his father, taking over the business during the illness of nearly twelve months which ended in his father's death in September 1802. Brockedon then spent six months in London in the house of a watch manufacturer. Sir Charles Fellows by William Brockedon.Charles Fellows, National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved June 2010 On his return to Totnes he continued to carry on the business for his mother for five years. Robert Hurrell Froude, then rector of Dartington, encouraged him to pursue painting as a profession, and supported him during studies at the Royal Academy. Brockedon found another generous patron in Arthur Howe Holdsworth, governor of Dartmouth Castle. Painter Illustration from Little Saint Bernard, the mont Genevre, the mont Cenis, the mont Saint Gothard, the Great Saint Bernard, and the monte Stelvio, 1828 From 1809 he pursued his studies in London as a painter with little interruption till 1815. Immediately after the battle of Waterloo he went to Belgium and France, and saw the gallery of the Louvre before its dispersion. From 1812 to 1837 he was a regular contributor to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy and the British Institution. In these twenty-five years he exhibited 65 works, historical, landscape, and portraits: 36 at the Academy and 29 at the British Institution. The works he exhibited in 1812 were portraits of Governor Holdsworth, M.P., and of Samuel Prout, who was, like himself, a Devonshire artist. He next exhibited a portrait of 'Miss S. Booth as Juliet', pictures on scriptural and other subjects, portraits of Sir Alexander Burns and Sir George Back, and landscapes of Alpine and Italian scenery. Another large picture, representing the 'Delivery of the Tables of the Law to Moses on Mount Sinai,' was presented by him to Christ's Hospital in 1835. A picture, painted at Rome in 1821, the 'Vision of the Chariots to the Prophet Zechariah,' was by permission of Pope Pius VII exhibited in the Pantheon. Brockedon was elected a member of the Academies of Rome and Florence. In compliance with a law of the Florentine Academy he presented it with his portrait painted by his own hand. Brockedon's portrait was hung in the Uffizi of the Florence Gallery near those of Reynolds and Northcote. Writer Brockedon was meanwhile earning for himself a reputation as an author. In 1824 he made an excursion to the Alps for the purpose of investigating the route of Hannibal, and the idea of publishing Illustrations of the Passes occurred to him. During the summers of 1825, 1826, 1828, and 1829, he was led in the course of his journeys to cross the Alps fifty-eight times, and to pass into and out of Italy by more than forty different routes. The result was the publication, in 1827, of the first part of his Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps by which Italy communicates with France, Switzerland, and Germany. The work, containing 109 engravings, was issued in twelve parts, from 1827 to 1829, forming when complete two royal quarto volumes, and was dedicated to his earliest patron, Archdeacon Froude. The drawings, which were entirely by Brockedon's own hand, were done in sepia, and were sold in 1837 to George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon for 500 guineas. In 1833 he published in one volume his Journals of Excursions in the Alps, the Pennine, Graian, Cottian, Rhetian, Lepontine, and Bernese. He also edited William Finden's Illustrations to the Life and Works of Lord Byron. In 1835 he edited for the Findens the Illustrated Road Book from London to Naples, with thirty illustrations by himself and his friends Prout and Stanfield. In 1836 he wrote for Blackwood's Magazine Extracts from the Journal of an Alpine Traveller, and he subsequently wrote the Savoy and Alpine parts of Murray's Handbook for Switzerland. His next work, published in folio in 1842-4, was Italy, Classical, Historical, and Picturesque, illustrated and described, with sixty engravings from drawings by himself, Eastlake, Prout, Roberts, Stanfield, Harding, and other friends. In 1855, in conjunction with George Croly, he wrote part of the text of David Roberts's The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia, Croly writing the historical, and Brockedon the descriptive portions. Works  In Literature Letitia Elizabeth Landon published a poem on the subject of Brockedon's painting of Raphael Showing his Mistress her Portrait in The Literary Gazette in 1824. Inventor In 1819 he turned attention to the mode of wire-drawing then in use. Brockedon invented a mode of drawing the wire through holes pierced in sapphires, rubies, and other gems. He patented this invention, and visited Paris in connection with it; but it was not a source of profit. In 1831 he invented and patented, in conjunction with Mr. Mordan, a pen of a form called the 'oblique,' from the slit being in the usual direction of the writing. He next turned his attention to the preparation of a substitute for corks and bungs by coating felt with vulcanised india-rubber. He took out a patent for this invention in 1838, and in 1840 and 1842 enlarged its scope by other patents for retaining fluids in bottles, and for the manufacture of fibrous materials for the cores of stoppers. This invention led to his forming business relations with Messrs. Charles Macintosh & Co. of Manchester. About the year 1841 he submitted to them his patents for a substitute for corks, through which he was interested in their business till 1845, when he became a partner, and retained that position till his death. In 1843 he patented an invention for the manufacture of wadding for firearms; another for compressing sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate into the form of pills and lozenges; and for preparing or treating plumbago by reducing common black lead to powder, and then compressing it in vacuo, so as to produce artificial plumbago for lead pencils purer than any that could then be obtained, in consequence of the exhaustion of the mines in Cumberland, and especially valuable to artists because free from (diamond) grit. The invention was first worked for him by Messrs. Mordan & Co., but at his death in 1854 the plant and machinery were sold by auction, and bought by one of the merchants connected with the lead industry at Keswick. In 1844, 1846, and 1851, he patented inventions for various applications of vulcanised india-rubber. Later life In 1830 Brockedon took an active part in the formation of the Royal Geographical Society, and was elected a member of its first council. He was afterwards the founder of the Graphic, an art society. On 12 June 1830 he was elected a member of the Athen√¶um. On 18 December 1834 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He died on 29 August 1854, in his sixty-sixth year, at 29 Devonshire Street, Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and was buried in the grave which contained the remains of his first wife and his son in the burial-ground of St. George the Martyr, in Hunter Street, Brunswick Square. Family He married in 1821 Elizabeth Graham, who died in childbirth on 23 July 1829, in her fortieth year, leaving two children, Philip North, born at Florence on 27 April 1822, and Mary, married to Joseph H. Baxendale, the head of the firm of Pickford & Co. The son, who was educated as a civil engineer, became the favourite pupil of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but died of consumption at the age of 28, on 13 November 1849. On 8 May 1839 Brockedon married, as his second wife, the widow of Captain Farwell of Totnes, who survived him, and by whom he had no issue.

History WJSA was originally an AM only radio station authorized to operate during the daytime at 1600 on the dial. Though not a Christian format, the station did air some daily devotional programs. In the fall of 1980 the station's owner, Williamsport businessman Ken Breon, sought the help of John Hogg as broadcast engineer and programing consultant, then within the year as general manager. Under Mr. Hogg's management and with Mr. Breon's agreement and involvement, the station changed format to full-time Christian programming. The AM station also extended its hours of operation and improved coverage. The Birth of WJSA-FM 24 years ago, Mr. Hogg identified an available FM frequency which would provide extended coverage and allow 24 hours a day service. Two years later the FCC granted the application and Light for Life... WJSA-FM began broadcasting on November 1, 1984 with a power of 3,000 watts at 93.5 FM. A new company to operate the facilities was formed, Covenant Broadcast Company, a partnership between Ken Breon and John Hogg. Expanding the FM Coverage Almost immediately Mr. Hogg identified the opportunity for several stations in the area to upgrade their signal strength by changing frequencies. This required cooperation of those stations and FCC approval took the next 12 years. In the early spring of 1997 this power upgrade was realized and Light for Life...WJSA's frequency was changed to 96.3 FM with a power equivalent of 25,000 watts.

Route description Route 243 begins in the Westville neighborhood of New Haven as Fountain Street branching from Whalley Avenue (Route 63 towards the west, while Whalley Avenue continues northwest). Fountain Street passes by the Westville Post Office then continues through the residential part of Westville. Along the way, it intersects Route 122 (Forest Road and Dayton Street). Fountain Street continues west, going under the Wilbur Cross Parkway (with no junction) into the town of Woodbridge.

T. Barnum and Dan Castello in 1870 to form the \\"P. T. Barnum's Museum, Menagerie and Circus\\". Previously Barnum had a museum at a fixed location in New York City and the traveling circus allowed him to bring his curiosities to more paying customers. Coup's innovations were the circus train to transport the materials from town to town. He also came up with the concept of adding a second ring in 1872 and a third ring to the circus in 1881 to allow more people to view the events. Biography He was born in 1837 in Mount Pleasant, Martin County, Indiana. His father purchased a tavern, which was not what William wished to do with his life. He worked in a country newspaper office as a \\"devil\\". However, this was not to his liking either. Coup went to see a show and decided to apprentice himself to the show. In 1853, he joined E. F. & J. Mabie Circus, where he secured sideshow privileges. Between 1866 and 1869, he had similar privileges with the Yankee Robinson Circus. He and Dan Castello formed a partnership that had a show travel by boat in 1869, visiting the ports of the Great Lakes. The show was a success. Dan Castello suggested he work with P. T. Barnum. In 1870, Castello, Coup and Barnum created \\"P. T. Barnum‚Äôs Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Circus and Hippodrome\\" in New York City. Coup started to use rail transportation for the circus in 1872, against Barnum's judgement. In 1874, Coup built the New York Hippodrome as a permanent amusement building. This fatigued him, and in 1875 he ended his partnership in the circus and moved to Europe. In the second quarter of 1876, he returned to the US and formed a new partnership with Charles Reiche to build the New York Aquarium, which opened on . After a disagreement about opening on Sunday with Reiche, he sold his part at a loss.

He represented Wales in international football, making seven appearances. Partridge's club career included spells at Dundee United and Motherwell in Scotland, Bristol City in England and St. Patrick's Athletic in Ireland, as well as several other clubs on loan. He ended his career in English non-League football, with Cambridge United and Thurrock. Club career Dundee United Born in Westminster, London, Partridge joined West Ham United as an apprentice in August 1996 but did not break into the first-team and joined Dundee United for a fee of ¬£40,000 in March 1999. An agreed move to Plymouth Argyle, where he would have linked up with his former Dundee United manager, Paul Sturrock, in August 2001, fell through and Partridge eventually joined English Division Three side Leyton Orient in January 2002 on a three-month loan, having made 75 league and cup appearances for Dundee United in three seasons. Having made three appearances, Partridge was sent off on his home debut for Leyton Orient, after fracturing the jaw of Swansea City defender Terry Evans with a deliberate elbow. Following his return, he made a further four appearances for Leyton Orient in his loan spell. Motherwell Partridge joined Motherwell on a free transfer in July 2002. Manager Terry Butcher had spotted Partridge playing for West Ham reserves and brought him to Dundee United where he was working at the time. When Butcher took over at Motherwell, he made Partridge his first signing. His performances for Motherwell led to him being called up for the Wales national football squad in January 2005. Butcher said of Partridge, \\"It just shows what players can achieve if they knuckle down and work hard [...] He's a left-footed centre-half and there are not many good ones about. If you do well at Scottish Premier level, which is still a good standard, then you have a great chance to show what you can do on the international stage. David is in a good position to go on from here and establish himself with Wales, I've always had a good feeling about him.\\" Partridge made a total of 86 league and cup appearances in three seasons for Motherwell. Bristol City Partridge joined Bristol City for ¬£150,000 at the start of the 2005‚Äì2006 season, signing a three-year contract. Manager Brian Tinnion described him as \\"..a left-sided central defender, a tough character who will inspire.\\" He made 13 league and cup appearances for Bristol City in the 2005‚Äì2006 season but following the arrival of Gary Johnson as manager and a breach of club discipline for which Partridge and other players were fined two weeks' wages after being arrested on suspicion of violent disorder following an incident in a nightclub in October 2005, he was sent out on loan to Milton Keynes Dons in January 2006 until the end of the season. He was transfer listed in May 2006 after returning from Milton Keynes Dons and joined Leyton Orient on a one-month loan at the start of the 2006‚Äì2007 season with a view to a permanent transfer. However, in September 2006, he was sentenced to two months in prison alongside teammates Bradley Orr and Steve Brooker for his part in the \\"drink-fuelled brawl\\" at a nightclub in the previous October. He was released after one month but was unable to win back a first-team place at Bristol City and joined Brentford on a one-month loan in January 2007. On his third appearance for Brentford against Yeovil, he was sent off for headbutting and subsequently his loan spell was not extended. Partridge returned to Bristol City and then joined Swindon Town on a one-month loan in March 2007. His lack of fitness however meant that he did not make an appearance for Swindon and he returned to Bristol City the following month. A broken hand suffered during the summer of 2007 meant that he missed all of pre-season training and was ruled out of the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season. His contract with Bristol City was terminated by mutual consent in August 2007. Brentford Partridge signed a one-month contract at Brentford on 20 December 2007 as a free agent. However, he made no appearances for the Football League Two side. St Patrick's Athletic Partridge signed for League of Ireland runners-up St Patrick's Athletic on 29 January 2008. Initially used at left back, he soon settled into a centre-half spot where he impressed greatly as a solid, no-nonsense defender with very good distribution of the ball out of defence. Injury and suspensions have halted his progress with the Saints though he returned to the first team for the 2009 season. Non-League football Partridge was signed by Conference National side Cambridge United in January 2010 as a replacement for the departing Wayne Hatswell. He was released by Cambridge at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, and joined Thurrock at the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season. International career He has represented Wales at Under-18 and Under-16 level, as well as securing an Under-21 cap against Turkey in 1997. He was called up to the senior squad and made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 friendly win over Hungary in February 2005. He went on to make further appearances in Wales' 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign against Austria, Slovenia England, Poland and Northern Ireland. His last appearance for Wales was the friendly game against Trinidad & Tobago in May 2006.

Headed by Jean-Paul David, founder of the anti-Communist movement Paix et Libert√© (Peace and Freedom), it was in fact a right-of-center conservative coalition, which presented candidates to the June 1946, November 1946, and 1951 legislative elections. Despite its name, the coalition was on the right wing of French politics; for a long time, the French republican right has refused to call itself \\"right\\" since the right-wing in France has historically been associated with monarchism (this practice is known as sinistrisme). It was subsidised by French employers, who saw in it the best defense against Communism and the defender of economic liberalism, in a context marked by various nationalizations supported by the French Communist Party (PCF), the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and the Gaullist movement. Employers conceived the RGR as such until at least the 1951 creation of the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) gathering independent conservative deputies. During the 1956 legislative campaign, it became a political party led by Edgar Faure and Radicals who refused to join the Republican Front coalition.  Composition of the coalition  The RGR was largely composed of the Radical-Socialist Party, which had governed France during most of the Third Republic, and of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (Union d√©mocratique et socialiste de la R√©sistance), which included Ren√© Pleven and Fran√ßois Mitterrand. The UDSR was a founding member of the Liberal International in 1947. Others parties included: *Republican Social Party of French Reconciliation (Parti r√©publicain social de la r√©conciliation fran√ßaise), founded by former members of Colonel de la Rocque's Parti Social Fran√ßais (PSF) *Democratic Republican Alliance (Alliance D√©mocratique), main right-wing party during the interwar period *Democratic Socialist Party (Parti socialiste d√©mocratique) of Paul Faure, which gathered former SFIO members excluded from that party because of their Collaborationism *Independent Radicals (Radicaux ind√©pendants), radicals refusing the Radical- Socialist Party alliance with the left-wing during the Cartel des gauches, issued from a scission in 1928; the group is reconstituted at the Liberation by the mayor of Nice, Jacques M√©decin *Republican-Socialist Party (Parti r√©publicain-socialiste) created by independent socialists who had refused the unification of the socialist movement in 1905 under the SFIO, which was, like the Independent Radicals, almost an empty shell by then.  Foundation  After World War II, France was governed by the Three-parties alliance composed of the Communists, the Socialists and the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP). The Radical Party and the pre-war right-wing groups were considered jointly responsible for the 1940 collapse of the Third Republic. In the same time, the attempt to gather the non-Communist Resistance in a new party, the UDSR, failed. In 1946, they formed a coalition to resist to the Three-parties alliance in the legislative elections. They defined themselves as \\"left-wing republicans\\" whilst they opposed left-wing policies. Indeed, until the end of the 19th century, the French left was defined as republican and the right as pro-monarchy. Then, when the republic was no longer questioned, the conservative republican groups, who had sat at the center-left of the assemblies, moved to the right-wing seats, but they continued to consider themselves as left-wingers: this is known as sinistrisme. When the Communists were ejected from the government during the May 1947 crisis, the RGR joined the government of the Third force with the SFIO, the MRP, then the National Center of Independents and Peasants. The RGR obtained 11.6% of the votes in 1946, 11,1% in 1951 and 3.9% of 1956 (most of the Radicals had decided to present themselves as members of the Republican Front of Pierre Mend√®s France.) In 1955, under the leaderships of Pierre Mend√®s France and Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the Radical Party and the UDSR advocated left-wing policies and left the RGR. Their internal opponents pursued the RGR, which became a small center-right party led by Prime Minister Edgar Faure and composed of Radicals expelled from the party. It disappeared in 1958, many Radicals joining again the Radical party while Jean-Paul David created the Parti lib√©ral europ√©en (European Liberal Party), which would eventually fusion in 1978 with the Parti Radical Valoisien.

Collected samples are analyzed for bacteria, chlorine levels, pH, inorganic and organic pollutants, turbidity, odor and many other water quality indicators. In the United States, water sampling stations aid in public infrastructural safety in regards to water quality monitoring and help municipalities comply with federal and state drinking water regulations.

Hewitt was a prominent architectural firm in the eastern United States at the turn of the twentieth century. It was founded in Philadelphia in 1878, by brothers George Wattson Hewitt (1841‚Äì1916) and William Dempster Hewitt (1847‚Äì1924), both members of the American Institute of Architects. The firm specialized in churches, hotels and palatial residences, especially crenelated mansions such as Maybrook (1881), Druim Moir (1885‚Äì86) and Boldt Castle (1900‚Äì04). The last was built for George C. Boldt, owner of Philadelphia's Bellevue-Stratford Hotel (1902‚Äì04), G.W. & W.D. Hewitt's most well-known building.David R. Contosta, Suburb in the City: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1850-1990 (Ohio State University Press, 1992) Career George Hewitt worked in the office of John Notman, and became an expert on English ecclesiastical architecture. In 1867, he formed a partnership with John Fraser and Frank Furness, which lasted until 1871. The younger men formed their own firm, Furness & Hewitt, whose most notable building was the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871‚Äì76). Louis Sullivan worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness & Hewitt (June ‚Äì November 1873), and left descriptions of the Hewitt brothers (speaking of himself in third person as \\"Louis\\"): > George Hewitt [was] a slender, moustached person, pale and reserved, who > seldom relaxed from pose. It was he who did the Victorian Gothic in its > pantalettes, when a church building or something of the sort was on the > board. With precision, as though he held his elements by pincers, he worked > out the decorous sublimities of inanity, as per the English current > magazines and other English sources. He was a clean draftsman, and believed > implicitly that all that was good was English. Louis regarded him with > admiration as a draftsman, and with mild contempt as a man who kept his nose > in books. But George Hewitt had a younger brother named John [sic], and John > was foreman of the shop. He was a husky, smooth-faced fellow under thirty. > Every feature in his clean cut, rather elongated face, bespoke intelligence > and kindness, in fact a big heart. He had taken a fancy to Louis from the > start. He was the 'practical man' and Louis ran to him for advice whenever > he found himself in a tight place. John was patience itself and made > everything clear with dainty sketches and explanatory notes. These drawings > were beautiful and Louis frankly told him so. He begged John to teach him > 'touch' and how to make such sketches, and especially how to 'indicate' so > crisply. This John did. In fact, it was not long before he made of Louis a > draftsman of the Upper crust, and Louis's heart went out to lovable John in > sheer gratitude.Louis Sullivan, Autobiography of an Idea (1924; reprint, New > York: Dover, 1956), pp. 190-96. St. Peter's Episcopal Church of Germantown, 1873 Writing a half century after the fact, Sullivan misremembered William Hewitt's name (there was no John Hewitt). Furness & Hewitt continued until 1875, and George opened his own firm, making his brother William a partner in 1878. In the early 1880s, Henry H. Houston, a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad, began developing in the western Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. The Hewitt brothers did the planning for the upper-class suburb and designed the principal buildings, including a resort hotel, the Wissahickon Inn (1883‚Äì84) (now Chestnut Hill Academy); the first clubhouse for the Philadelphia Cricket Club (1883‚Äì84, burned 1909); Houston's own mansion, Druim Moir (1886); and St. Martin-in-the- Fields Episcopal Church (1888). More than 100 Chestnut Hill houses were designed by the Hewitts.James B. Garrison, Houses of Philadelphia: Chestnut Hill and the Wissahickon Valley (New York: Acanthus Press, 2008) p. 295. Horace Trumbauer did his apprenticeship with the firm. Phineas Paist worked for the firm, and became a partner in it. Following George's 1907 retirement, the firm continued as Hewitt, Stevens & Paist. Houston-Sauveur House, Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, PA (1885).

Balarama is a bull born about 1958 and is accompanied in the procession by other Dasara Elephants. Of the many (about 16) elephants participating, Balarama was one of the star attraction when he carried on his back the sacred idol of goddess Chamundeshwari in the golden howdah on the auspicious 10th day of Dasara celebrations.  History  Balarama was captured in 1987 in the Kattepura forest near Somwarpet, in the Kodagu region of Karnataka. Balarama has taken part in the Dasara procession since 1994, carrying the golden howdah. A very silent bull (against the norm for elephants), he is said to be an introvert, and has to have special training so he can withstand the firing of canons that occurs during the festival. He succeeded Drona as the carrier of the Golden Howdah. Balarama was not the first choice to carry the Howdah after Drona. Elephant Arjuna, a 44-year-old bull weighing was supposed to be the carrier of the howdah, but was sidelined for accidentally killing a Mahout. One day, Arjuna went to bathe in a river with elephant Bahadur and Bahadur's trainer Annayya. While crossing a road, the elephants were startled by a vehicle and in the chaos that ensued, the rider Annayya fell down to the ground, only to be stamped on the head by Arjuna. He was crushed to death. People opined that an elephant that had killed a man was unfit to carry the religious duties of Dasara. So Arjuna, while being as capable as Drona, was not given the honorable duty, though he did have the honour of carrying the Chinnada Ambari once before being replaced by Balarama. Balarama has now been rested from the duty of carrying the Golden Howdah due to his reducing weight and has been succeeded by Arjuna. Balarama now leads the procession as the 'nishane aane' or the lead elephant. Balarama's Mahout Sannappa once refused to mount Balarama after his family were stopped by the police from watching him ride during Dasara. Balarama refuses food given to him by anybody other than his Mahout. Balarama weighs about 4590 Kilograms and he conquers the hearts of human beings by his majestic looks and the silence that he possess. He is looked after at the Morkal Elephant camp at Nagarahole national park and his previous mahout Sannappa has retired and his new master Thimma has taken over. At 61 years he still looks strong though his weight has reduced over the years.

It is headed by a \\"master\\" appointed for a term of five years. The Office and the consultants who advise it support the pope in expressing his interpretation of the liturgical modifications instituted following the Second Vatican Council. Popes have at times supported post-Council reforms, restored earlier practices, and introduced further innovations. When Pope Francis named five new consultants in September 2013, he included none of those appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, who were known to promote a return to pre-Council liturgical practices. Benedict restored pre-Council elements to the rite for the canonization of saints and Francis removed them and further shortened the ceremony. Guido Marini, the Master when Francis instituted his changes, is known as a traditionalist, but performs to the pope's instructions. In the words of one journalist, his job is \\"to thread papal preferences into the pageantry\\". For example, he works to ensure that liturgical music is integrated into the liturgy as Francis prefers, so that participants are never forced to wait for music to conclude before proceeding. On 19 January 2019, Pope Francis transferred responsibility for the Sistine Chapel Choir from the Papal household to this Office.

Club career Born in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, and a product of the Scottish Highland Football League, Murray made his debut at his local Highland League club Fraserburgh aged just 16, where he played for the first-team for four years while working full-time in a local fish processing factory. Impressive on- field performances lead to interest from Aberdeen, Rangers and Liverpool. After scoring in a trial game for Liverpool's reserves, Graeme Souness was shortly sacked as first-team manager and therefore any chance of signing a deal faded. However, Aston Villa stepped in, and after scoring the quickest ever hat-trick in the Premiership reserve league - with his three strikes coming inside the first 12 minutes - Villa paid Fraserburgh ¬£35,000 (at the time, the biggest fee received by a Highland League club for a transfer) for his services. During his three years at Villa Park, Murray failed to make a big impression and made only four league appearances in that time. He was signed by Bristol City from Aston Villa in December 1997 and was City's top scorer in the 2002‚Äì03 season. That season he was part of the side that won the 2003 Football League Trophy Final. He later joined Reading for ¬£650,000 in June 2003, and was a first team regular for Alan Pardew. In March 2004, he rejoined Bristol City. Murray's return boosted City's form but they lost in that season's playoff final to Brighton & Hove Albion. He was made club captain during Brian Tinnion's spell as manager. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, City were drawn against Premier League side Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. Murray scored a chip against Australian number one Mark Schwarzer to earn the Robins a 2‚Äì2 draw at Ashton Gate, however they eventually lost the tie on penalties in the replay. A key player in City's promotion push despite a stress fracture to his fourth metatarsal bone restricting him to 37 appearances, he signed a new one-year extension to his contract. On 15 September, Murray became new Cheltenham Town manager Martin Allen's first signing on an emergency one-month loan, returning to Bristol City on 15 December. Murray was released by Bristol City in May 2009. On 1 July, it was confirmed that he had signed a one-year contract with Yeovil Town becoming manager Terry Skiverton's third summer signing. He scored a brace in the 2‚Äì2 home draw with Brighton to rescue a point, with goals either side of half time bringing up his 100th and 101st career goals. He was released by Yeovil along with three other players on 13 May 2010. Murray signed for part-time Football Conference side Bath City on a 12-month deal so that he could focus on his coaching role at Bristol City. International Murray has been capped by the Scotland B team after coming on as a substitute against Germany.

The villages suffered extensive damage after flash floods caused by an exceptional amount of rain that fell over eight hours that afternoon. The flood in Boscastle was filmed and extensively reported but the floods in Crackington Haven and Rocky Valley were not mentioned beyond the local news. The floods were the worst in local memory. A study commissioned by the Environment Agency from hydraulics consulting firm HR Wallingford concluded that it was among the most extreme ever experienced in Britain. The peak flow was about 140 m3/s, between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm BST. The annual chance of this (or a greater) flood in any one year is about 1 in 400. The probability each year of the heaviest three-hour rainfall is about 1 in 1300 (although rainfall probability is not the same as flood probability). At midday on 16 August 2004, heavy thundery showers had developed across the South West due to a weak disturbance to the northeast of the United Kingdom. The last time Boscastle had suffered notable flooding was in 1996 as a result of Hurricane Lili, but floods are recorded in 1847, 1957, on 3 June 1958 (one man drowned) and in 1963. On 16 August 1952 the small town of Lynmouth, north-east along the north coast in Devon near Exmoor, suffered extensive damage in a catastrophic flood, in which 34 people lost their lives. Coincidentally, this was 52 years to the day before Boscastle's 2004 flood. Causes of the flood On the 16th, warm air picking up moisture ‚Äì due to residual heat from the Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall on the afternoon of 16 August 2004. 185 mm (7 inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of the downpour, at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200 mm and 185 mm respectively on the day, whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3 mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect. The torrential rain led to a rise in river levels in one hour. A wave, believed to have been triggered by water pooling behind debris caught under a bridge and then being suddenly released as the bridge collapsed, surged down the main road. Water speed was over , more than enough to cause structural damage. It is estimated that of water flowed through Boscastle that day alone. The steep valley sides, and the saturated surface ensured a high amount of surface run-off. Changes in farming practice in the area also possibly contributed, sewage could have been a cause as well, with a reduction of trees and hedges higher up the valley causing water to flow through more quickly than would have been the case in the past. No one died in the flood. Impact of the flood 75 cars, 5 caravans, 6 buildings and several boats were washed into the sea; approximately 100 homes and businesses were destroyed, and some had to be demolished; trees were uprooted and debris were scattered over a large area. In an operation lasting from mid-afternoon until 2:30 am, a fleet of 7 Westland Sea King helicopters rescued about 150 people clinging to trees and the roofs of buildings and cars. No major injuries or loss of life were reported. The estimated cost of damage was ¬£15 million. Work since the flood The rebuilt Harbour Light in October 2006, now used as tea rooms. The shop is over the river. Most work took place in the winter season (October‚ÄìMay), during the off-season. The carpark was reduced to half capacity (120 spaces) in winter, for works to take place, and then back to 240 spaces in summer. 2004 *August: Buildings searched, buried cars removed from harbour, trees removed, roads cleared, B3263 bridge temporary concrete parapets installed. *20 August: Boscastle Coast Path closed *14 September: Work started on the overflow culvert for the Valency River. *December: Overflow culvert work completed. Also many hard sticks were inserted into the ground so it would create a barrier against the flood. 2005 *Early 2005: Most shops and restaurants re-open * Boscastle power system renewed * Water supply restored * Food supply restored * The flood defences were increased * Defences improved strongly * Rebuilding and repairs are mostly finished 2006 *30 October: Work on two underground pumping stations for the sewage treatment scheme began. *1 November: Work started to widen and lower the river channel to increase capacity. *December: A new visitor centre opened, in the former Harbour Restaurant, bought by the National Trust. *December: The car park level was raised, and extended, reducing the risk of cars being washed away . 2007 *January: Work started on the 'gateway building' next to the car park, to contain toilets, a bus shelter, and information boards. *April: Work stopped on gateway building due to problems with planning permission, and the building being built taller than expected. *21 June: Boscastle reflooded, although it was not nearly as bad as during the 2004 floods. *September: Work restarted on Gateway Building, after planning permission is approved to lower the height of the building *October: Work started on rebuilding an old culvert at the top of the village, to allow more water to flow through in periods of heavy rain. *October: Work started on installing the pipes for the new sewage treatments works, in the harbour area (between the Lower and Upper bridges). *12 November: The main road in the harbour area was closed, from the bridge to the car park, while Cormac started work on new wider pavements, and Carillion installed pipes under the road for the new sewage treatment works. *14 December: The main road in the harbour area was reopened and temporary traffic lights put in place. *18 December: The new lower bridge was installed. 2008 * January: Work on improving the harbour pavements completed. Work on rebuilding the culvert next to the petrol station completed. * February: Work began on renewing the culvert in Dunn Street, to allow more water through in times of heavy rain. * March: The Harbour area road was resurfaced. Work on rebuilding the culvert in Dunn Street completed. * April: Old Lower Bridge was demolished, and the new Lower Bridge was brought into use. The lower bridge The New Lower Bridge, taken on 20 December 2007. The main structure of the former lower bridge survived the flood, however the stone walls did not, and were washed away. On 1 May 2005, the official reopening of the village, wooden fences were used on the bridge to temporarily replace the stone walls. The bridge used to have a concrete plaque on it saying \\"This bridge is the private property of the lord of the manor, August 1887\\". This was lost during the flood, but then recovered from the harbour in good condition. This bridge has now been replaced with a new one. During the flood of 2004, 14 cars became lodged beneath it, this had caused a huge backlog of flood water and debris, adding to the damage caused in the surrounding area. The original proposal was for a stone bridge, this was rejected. The second proposal is for a modern concrete bridge, with steel railings. Public consultations were held and villagers were asked to select their preference from four designs; most did not choose the one which has been proposed. This plan was rejected. The new bridge is a few metres further down the river than the old bridge. The bridge was installed on 18 December 2007, and was made by Cornish Concrete, a company based near Truro. The main arch is made from reinforced concrete, with metal railings. The old stone bridge, which was over 100 years old, was demolished in early April 2008. Mini flood ‚Äì 21 June 2007 Boscastle flooded again, although not nearly as badly as the 2004 floods. After an afternoon of intense localised rainfall, and a week of steady rain everyday, a small flood happened on 21 June 2007. 30 mm fell on the area in one hour. Roads had become flooded in the area and in the village, most water came from the saturated fields around the village. Many drains had become blocked. Roads around the Tintagel, Camelford and Davidstow area were closed off to stop people visiting the village. River levels were alarmingly high, but the banks contained the water. However the many culverts of the River Jordan had overflowed onto the villages roads, adding to the amount of water on the roads.

In April 2014, after a period of silence, Kahlon announced in an interview with the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth his intention to return to politics \\"imminently\\", but that he had not decided on a \\"framework\\" for his return; in the same interview, he criticised the socio- economic and diplomatic policies of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding to speculation that he would attempt to run against Netanyahu in the future elections.

History The lighthouse was requested, along with buoys for the lake, in 1913 by the Lake Tahoe Protective Association, and was built under the direction of J. J. Bodilsen in 1916; the work was done by the United States Coast Guard. The keeper was paid $180 per year, and was \\"required to furnish his own launch for visiting and recharging the light and in addition to shipping and receiving supplies for the light will be required to make a short trip each night to a point from which the light can be observed, there being no year around resident on the lake who can properly inspect the light from his residence.Rubicon Point Lighthouse\\" Official sources state that the light was only lit for three years, until 1919; some locals, however, report that the tower was lit until sometime in the 1920s or 1930s. Still others report that it was discontinued in 1921. It was replaced by a light at Sugar Pine Point. The light at Rubicon Point was acetylene-powered. Two 300-gallon tanks of the fuel were brought to Emerald Point daily, then taken to the light by mule or wagon. Maintaining the lighthouse was expensive; this appears to be the reason why it was abandoned fairly quickly. Over the years it has deteriorated to the point that many people mistake it for an outhouse. Today efforts are being made to restore the tower. The lighthouse at Rubicon Point has the highest elevation of any American lighthouse; it stands above sea level, at a point where it could be seen from most places around the lake. It is currently located in D. L. Bliss State Park. The Rubicon Point Light was added to the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List in 1997.
