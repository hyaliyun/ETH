It used to be owned by Altadis until it was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in 2008.  History  Bastos was founded in the 1830s by the Spanish pioneer and businessman Juan Bastos (1817‚Äì1889). He and his parents moved from his birthplace in M√°laga to Oran in French Algeria the day after the French conquered the place. They were among the first Spaniards to live in Algeria at the time. Old pack of Bastos cigarettes Not long after, Juan opened a tobacco shop, just as it existed back in Spain, with the intent of providing the soldiers there with snuff. His first tobacco company was called \\"Cigars and Cigarettes J. Bastos\\", was founded in 1838 and was one of the first \\"industrial\\" establishments of the new colony. After the death of Juan on 1 September 1889, his widow Francisca and his four children transformed the Tobacco Factory Juan Bastos into a partnership. Just before the start of the First World War, the Bastos company transformed itself into a Public limited company and was known as one the first industrial enterprises in Algeria. When Emmanuel (one of Juan's sons) died in 1920, the members of the family sold their shares, which were bought immediately by the Hoskier Bank. Eventually, a second bank, the Cr√©dit Foncier de France would acquire almost all of the shares held by the Bastos family. After World War II and the Algerian War, in which Algeria became independent, the Bastos house moved their operations to Cameroon, Louiseville (Canada), Bastia (France), Dakar (Senegal), Switzerland, Saigon (Vietnam) and, together with Job (another one of Juan's sons), a factory was built near Ajaccio (France). In 1986, the local Juan Bastos Tobacco Company in Cameroon was bought out by British American Tobacco after the company could not compete in the region anymore. Sponsorship Grand Prix Motorcycle Racing Bastos sponsored the Cagiva factory team during the 1986 and 1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. Markets Bastos was or still is sold in the following countries: Netherlands, West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Spain, Hungary, Madagascar and Vietnam. In (un)popular culture Virginia Woolf smoked Bastos cigarettes, and in a letter of August 1917 asked her friend Saxon Sydney-Turner to get her 3 packs, price 1/- each. He could only find two.

A lochan between the dunes at Coul Links. Oystercatchers at the mouth of Loch Fleet, at the northern end of the links. Coul Links is an area of sand dunes (referred to as \\"links\\" in the Scots language) in Sutherland, on the east coast of Scotland. It is located between Golspie and Dornoch, lying just to the north of the small village of Embo. The links are considered unusual within Scotland in displaying a complete transition from the foredune to dune system and coastal heathland. They also include habitats such as flooded slacks (troughs between dunes) and seasonal lochs. The links lie on the eastern side of Loch Fleet, and form part of the Loch Fleet Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet Special Protection Area (SPA), and the Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet Ramsar site, but are outwith the Loch Fleet national nature reserve (NNR). Between 1985 and 2010 the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) managed Coul Links under an agreement with the landowner, however the agreement was not renewed when it expired. The SWT continues to be involved in the management of the adjacent Loch Fleet NNR. A wide variety of plants are found on the links, including variegated horsetail, purple milk- vetch, rue-leaved saxifrage, moonwort and frog orchid. The heathland parts of the links host areas of juniper scrub. The site is important for Fonseca's seed fly (Botanophila fonsecai), as it represents over 30 % of the known global range of the species, which is endemic to the sand dunes of the east coast of Scotland. The links also host several other nationally rare species of invertebrate. Dog walkers, horse riding and unauthorised vehicle use at the links have been known to disturb terns, which occasionally attempt to nest on Coul Links. Golf course proposals In 2015 a company led by American Todd Warnock proposed to build a golf course on the links, which would have involved disturbing about 13 ha of dune habitat at Coul Links. Objections to the golf course were submitted by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB Scotland, Plantlife Scotland, Ramblers Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland and the International Otter Survival Fund. The objectors claimed that creation of a golf course would fundamentally affect the natural processes which have created the links, ending the natural movement of material that was a key part of the dune system, and would adversely affect the unique and protected flora and fauna of the site, as well as failing to fulfil legal obligations in respect of international conservation designations such as the Ramsar listing. The developers claimed that a golf course would improve conditions for birdlife on the links, as shooting of wildfowl would no longer be permitted, and that disturbance from visitors would reduce, especially during winter months when the course was closed. They noted that site received no specific habitat management, and claimed that this would be undertaken as a legally binding planning condition if permission were to be granted. The developers also proposed to purchase adjacent land and manage this for conservation purposes, and forecasted potential economic benefits such as increased employment and more tourism in the local area. Objectors questioned the economic case, noting that the controversial Menie golf development at Balmedie (which was undertaken by The Trump Organization, and has been compared to the Coul Links situation) failed to create the number of jobs or economic benefits predicted. Highland Council approved the plan on 20 June 2018, however in August the Scottish Government decided to \\"call in\\" the decision for further scrutiny at a national level.

Narins was born Lillian Rabinowitz in Philadelphia in 1907. Her parents, David Rabinowitz and Anna Merraine Rabinowitz, were Russian Jewish immigrants who arrived in the city in 1900. She taught in Philadelphia's public schools and married Arthur Narins in 1930. Arthur served in World War II, and Lillian later became the chairwoman of the Jewish War Veterans' Ladies Auxiliary. During the war, Narins served on the Citizens Committee for the Care of Children in Wartime. She left the teaching profession around that time and became involved in local politics. Narins joined the Progressive Party that was founded in 1948 to support Henry A. Wallace's third-party bid for the White House. In 1949, she collected signatures on a peace petition encouraging the United States to stay out of the conflict that would become the Korean War the following year. Her position was unpopular, leading to her ouster from the Jewish War Veterans position and her husband's resignation from the organization. That same year, Narins ran for a seat on the Philadelphia City Council in a special election that followed the death of Republican L. Wallace Egan. She made an issue of a recent transit fare hike, saying that the situation \\"did not warrant an increase in fares.\\" She tallied 1,290 votes, but lost handily to Democrat Harry Norwitch. Narins ran for the United States Senate in 1950, again as a Progressive. Her platform was against conscription, poll taxes, lynchings, and the registration of communists. If elected, she pledged to work for a higher minimum wage and a nationalized healthcare system. She received 5,516 votes, falling well short of the winner, Republican James H. Duff. From 1952 to 1954, Narins was repeatedly investigated by the FBI as a suspected communist. After the demise of the Progressive Party, she remained out of public life. Arthur Narins died in 1988 and Lillian passed in 1993. She was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania, survived by two nieces.

History  Bodo is one of the settlements in Far North that is badly affected by jihadist group Boko Haram's insurgency which originated in neighboring Nigeria in 2009. They started attacking Cameroon (along with Chad and Niger) in the mid-2010s. Bodo is just across the border which is only marked by a small river. Suicide bombers and raiders have repeatedly attacked the village, resulting in locals setting up a self-defense group. The most deadly attack in the village took place on 25 January 2016, when Bodo was struck by four female Boko Haram suicide bombers. They had disguised themselves as traders, and managed to circumvent the local self-defense fighters by using the dusty Harmattan winds to their advantage. The bombers then detonated themselves on the village's market, killing 35 people and wounding 70. The government responded by launching an attack on a suspected insurgent base at nearby Achigashia, and by closing all border markets to prevent further similar attacks. After Boko Haram fighters overran the town of Rann in Borno State, northeastern Nigeria on 14 January 2019, about 8,000 of its inhabitants fled across the border to Bodo. Humanitarian groups set up a refugee camp to accommodate the arrivals. Regardless, Cameroonian authorities forced all but 1,500 refugees to go back to Nigeria after a few days.

Until its incorporation in 2019, Double Horn was part of the community of Spicewood. Geography Double Horn is located at (30.494052, -98.222719). It is situated just north of State Highway 71 in southern Burnet County, about four miles west-northwest of Spicewood and five miles southeast of Marble Falls. The nearest major city is Austin, Texas, located 26 miles southeast of Double Horn. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Double Horn has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Spicewood, Texas History The original settlement of Double Horn was established near the headwaters of Double Horn Creek in 1855, with the creek and town named for an incident where a pioneer found the remains of two bucks with interlocked antlers. It had a post office from 1857 to 1911, a school (the Double Horn School), a cotton gin, and two churches. In 1884, the population was fifty; by 1896, this population had halved, and by 1936, only the school remained marked on state road maps. Double Horn had completely disappeared from maps as a separate community by the second half of the 20th century.Handbook of Texas Online This location is close to a lightly populated ranching area marked on modern topographic maps as Shovel Mountain.Caltopo The modern city of Double Horn, centered on the Double Horn subdivision, voted to incorporate in 2018 by a margin of 75-65, as a direct response to neighborhood concerns about the environmental impact of the nearby Spicewood Crushed Stone Quarry. The city's first mayor (Cathy Sereno), a fire marshal, and five aldermen were elected in February 2019. In response to the incorporation, the office of State Attorney General Ken Paxton sued to challenge the validity of the city's status; however, this lawsuit was dismissed in early April 2019. Education Public education in the city of Double Horn is provided by the Marble Falls Independent School District. Zoned campuses include Spicewood Elementary School (grades K-5; located in Spicewood), Marble Falls Middle School (grades 6-8), and Marble Falls High School (grades 9-12).

Robinson, a former coal miner. Robinson was also the editor of The Lonaconing Star from 1886 to 1905 in nearby Lonaconing, Maryland. The Herald's motto proclaimed that the publication was \\"Independent--Not Neutral,\\" the same motto that Robinson used for the Star. The newspaper's editorial positions advocated for honest government and a fair shake for the working people of Maryland. Robinson made it known that the intent of his paper was \\"to boldly, jealously and relentlessly do all in its power to safeguard the interests of the people,\\" exemplifying this in the same issue with an expos√© of the Frostburg city council's secret meetings under the headline: \\"The People Were Not Consulted.\\" The Frostburg Herald set itself in opposition to Frostburg's other main newspaper, the Frostburg Mining Journal, and its editor J. Benson Oder targeted Robinson with continuous jibes. Robinson was no stranger to editorial conflict, having previously (and unsuccessfully) attempted to sue the editor of The Frostburg Forum, John Farrell, for libel in 1898. These attacks escalated in June 1900, when Robinson was assaulted by rioting miners in Lonaconing. The perpetrators would later be found not guilty. In 1905, Robinson was sued by western Maryland's chief organizer of striking mine workers, William M. Wardjon, for libel; Robinson had publicly accused Wardjon of assaulting a nineteen-year-old girl. As a result, the offices of The Lonaconing Star were burned down by rioters, forcing Robinson to move his operations to the Herald's offices. This did not deter the rioters, who subsequently smashed the Herald's office's front windows. Though the Herald featured a wealth of advertisements from local firms, it was ultimately unsuccessful. The exact date that the Herald ceased publication is unknown, but is conjectured to be between 1905 and 1910, when Robinson moved to Cumberland, Maryland to work for the Cumberland Evening Times.

Canul had previously been involved in conflict with the British authorities over alleged infringements of his people's land rights and non- payment of rent and one motive for the raid may have been to seize the district magistrate for ransom. Canul and his men crossed the border from Mexico the day before the battle and were able to reach the town undetected by the British. They launched a surprise attack that caught the small garrison unaware ‚Äì the British commanders were in the bath at the time the battle started. The British forces ‚Äì a small detachment of the West India Regiment ‚Äì successfully defended their barracks building for a number of hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the Maya and fatally wounding Canul. The Maya then withdrew into Mexico.  Background  Marcus Canul was a chief of the Icaiche Maya. The Icaiche were on friendly terms with the government of neighbouring Mexico but had a history of conflict with the colony of British Honduras; Mexico itself had a disputed claim over land in the colony. Canul had fought the British in 1866, capturing for ransom a number of woodcutters working for the British Honduras Company in the Rio Bravo region. Later in the same year, he successfully fought the British for control of the Maya village of San Pedro. In response to these conflicts, reinforcements were sent to the colony and a force of over 300 British soldiers burned down San Pedro and several other Maya villages in northwestern British Honduras in order to drive the Maya from the area. A small force of Icaiche Maya advanced into British Honduras again in 1868 and made demands for rent on land over which they claimed ownership; however Canul disavowed the actions of this force. Orange Walk Town located around from the Mexican border in northern British Honduras had its origin as a logging camp on the New River. In 1872 the town had a population of around 1,200 ‚Äì largely mixed race Native American or mixed race European-Native American workers and a small British garrison.  Battle  On 31 August or early 1 September 1872 Canul led a force of the Maya across the Rio Hondo from Mexico; this has been described as being 150‚Äì180 strong with around 100 non-combatant camp followers. On 1 September he launched an attack on Orange Walk, to further his aim of collecting rent payments and returning lands he claimed were seized from his people. A British press report of the time stated that Canul had intended to seize the town's magistrate with the intention of collecting a ransom. British forces comprised Lieutenant Joseph Graham Smith and 37 men of the West India Regiment, together with the unit's Assistant Surgeon John Dallas Edge. At around 8 am Canul led about 180 armed Maya against the garrison's barracks, a wide and long structure built from 3\\" wooden stakes and roofed in palm leaves, that was situated midway between the town and the river. The Maya forces were able to approach the town undetected, a fact which led the British to suspect they had sympathisers in the local population. Canul split his force into three equal portions: one that attacked and looted the town and two that converged upon the barracks. Edge and Smith were out of the barracks bathing at the time of the attack and upon hearing the first shots had to make a desperate rush over the from their bath tubs to the building. Edge was completely naked and Smith clothed only in his drawers. Details of the subsequent battle are recorded in the West India regimental history published in 1885, an 1872 report in the Spectator and also in the personal correspondence of Edge; there are differences in some details. According to the Spectator, Smith was shot in the back during the run from his bath. The bullet is said to have struck near to both his heart and spinal column and both he and Edge thought the wound to be fatal. Edge states that Smith was incapacitated and that he subsequently took over command of the garrison. The regimental history records instead that Smith and Sergeant Belizario made a dash back to his quarters, braving the Maya cross fire to retrieve the key for the garrison magazine. Belizario then retrieved the portable magazine from an adjoining room and passed the contents through the wall to the garrison, all the while under heavy fire. Smith is then said to have taken up a position in the door of the barracks and returned fire against the Maya when he was struck by a bullet. By Edge's account he ordered the defenders to reinforce the walls of the barracks with their mattresses ‚Äì which apparently were sufficient to stop bullets; in the regimental history this action is attributed to Smith. One of the garrison, Private Bidwell, had been on detachment at a commissariat store in the town when the attack occurred. He took position in a compound overlooking the barracks and fired off his ten rounds of ammunition at the Maya. He then ran for the barracks to rejoin his comrades but was mortally wounded in doing so. The garrison kept up a defence of the structure for some four to six hours, during which time the Maya set fire to the town. At one point two American settlers ‚Äì Price and Brudrow ‚Äì joined the battle. Arriving from an outlying ranch they found themselves to the rear of the Maya; by opening fire they were able to cause enough confusion to ride over to the barracks. The Americans advocated a retreat over the river. Edge disagreed, stating that the act would kill Smith and endanger the men ‚Äì though he would permit the Americans to try on their own. Both Price and Brudrow decided to remain in the barracks. A number of civilian refugees from the town also joined Edge and his men. Many of the others including all the European women and children escaped from the town by boat to nearby San Estevan. Eventually Canul was mortally wounded and the Maya defeated, suffering some 30 to 50 men killed and an unknown number of wounded. The survivors escaped into Mexico. British losses were two men killed and 14 severely wounded. More than 300 bullet holes were recorded in the walls of the barracks. The morning after the attack a rumour spread that another force of Maya was forming to resume the assault. A British patrol was sent out which found only a scattered few in the bush. Edge claims to have spent the next three days in leading patrols to secure the town and extracting more than 26 bullets from the defenders. A 20-man British relief force arrived on the third day with a more substantial reinforcement arriving on the fourth day.  Aftermath  The battle was the last act of armed Maya resistance in British Honduras and also the last serious attack on that colony. The Icaiche Maya thereafter maintained an uneasy peace with the British authorities. The garrison was reinforced by a further 50 men of the West India Regiment from Jamaica on 25 September as a direct result of the attack. In 1874 the British constructed a fort on the site on the battle. Lieutenant Smith recovered from his wound and was promoted to command a company of the 97th Regiment. Assistant Surgeon Edge was promoted to Staff Surgeon on 3 December 1872 for his role in the battle and later became a major-general in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Belizario was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

Drafted into the Red Army in the late 1920s, Shugayev became a junior officer in cavalry units after enlisted service. After graduating from the Frunze Military Academy's staff department in the late 1930s, he served in staff positions, which he held by the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. After fighting in the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Moscow, Shugayev became a regimental commander in the 154th Rifle Division in early 1942. He continued in command of the same regiment when the division was converted into the 47th Guards Rifle Division, leading it during the division's advance into Ukraine from mid-1943. Given command of the division in March 1944, Shugayev was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership in the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive in August, but was severely wounded in late August and evacuated. Returning to command of the 47th Guards after nearly two months, he led it for the rest of the war, which it ended in the Battle of Berlin. After graduating from a course at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy in the late 1940s, he commanded the 180th and 36th Rifle Divisions before his 1954 retirement for health reasons.  Early life and interwar period  Shugayev was born on 9 April 1905 in the stanitsa of Ptichye, Stavropolsky Uyezd, Stavropol Governorate to a peasant family. He was drafted into the Red Army in November 1927 and became a Red Army man in the 28th Cavalry Regiment of the North Caucasus Military District, stationed in Novocherkassk. From November 1928, after graduating from the regimental school, he served in the regiment as an assistant platoon commander and starshina in the regimental school. Having became a Communist Party of the Soviet Union member in 1929, Shugayev decided to continue his service as an officer and entered the North Caucasus Mountain Peoples Cavalry School in Krasnodar in 1930. Upon graduation in 1932, he was assigned to the 76th S.M. Budyonny Red Banner Cavalry Regiment of the 12th Cavalry Division, serving as a commander of cavalry and regimental school platoons before becoming a machine gun squadron commander. From September 1935, he commanded a platoon of the 1st Cavalry Army Red Banner Combined Cavalry School in Tambov, and a year later transferred to the 5th M.F. Blinov Stavropol Cavalry Division, based at Slavuta in the Kiev Military District. There, Shugayev served as a squadron commander in the 29th Cavalry Regiment, and from December 1937 as assistant chief of staff of the 26th Cavalry Regiment. Between November 1938 and May 1939 he studied at the 5th faculty (staff work) of the Frunze Military Academy after passing examinations for seven years of schooling, then returned to his previous position. In September 1939 he was transferred to become temporary assistant head of the 1st staff department of the 2nd Cavalry Corps in the Odessa Military District. From December 1939, Shugayev served as chief of staff of the 101st Separate Reconnaissance Battalion of the Kiev Special Military District in Chernigov. In February 1940 he became head of the regimental school of the 33rd Rifle Regiment of the 187th Rifle Division, and in April was appointed assistant chief of staff of the division's 1st staff department. In that year, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.  World War II  At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Shugayev was appointed assistant chief of staff of the 2nd staff department of the 45th Rifle Corps of the Western Front. Elements of the corps fought with the 13th Army in the defense of the Minsk Fortified Region, but were forced by German attacks to withdraw beyond the Berezina in the area of Borisov. Between July and September, the corps as part of the 13th Army with the Central and then Western Fronts fought in the Battle of Smolensk. From 5 September, Shugayev was temporary chief of staff and deputy commander of the 510th Rifle Regiment of the 154th Rifle Division of the Bryansk Front. In October the regiment with the division fought in the Oryol-Bryansk defensive operation against Operation Typhoon. In November, as part of the 50th Army, it participated in defensive battles near Tula, fighting in the Tula defensive operation. From December, during the counteroffensive near Moscow, the regiment and division as part of the 50th Army fought in the Tula and Kaluga Offensives, during which they helped recapture Kaluga. In February 1942, Shugayev, now a captain, was appointed regimental commander, distinguishing himself in battles in the area of Vyshnee and Barsuki between 13 and 14 February. On 13 February, in the battle for Vyshnee, Shugayev was reported by his superiors to have \\"personally led the regimental attack\\", which was credited with destroying several firing points and killing up to 180 German soldiers. On the next day, in the battle for height 186.1 near Barsuki, he was wounded, but remained in the action. For his actions, Shugayev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 28 February.

Although the several forms of this city's name occur in ancient authors, yet on coins and in inscriptions the word Lappa is alone found. Stephanus of Byzantium shows plainly that the two names denote the same place, when he says that Xenion, in his Cretica, wrote the word Lappa, and not Lampa. The same authorsays that it was founded by Agamemnon, and was called after one Lampos, a Tarrhaean; the interpretation of which seems to be that it was a colony of Tarrha. When Lyctus had been destroyed by the Cnossians, its citizens found refuge with the people of Lappa. After the submission of Cydonia, Cnossus, Lyctus, and Eleutherna, to the arms of Metellus, the Romans advanced against Lappa, which was taken by storm, and appears to have been almost entirely destroyed.Dio Cassius 36.1.

It is maintained that it was Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo who devised the sky blue and white pavilion, being himself the one who designed the current coat of arms of the city. The flag is divided into 5 horizontal stripes, 3 of them sky blue and the other 2 white. In addition in the central sky blue fringe there are 3 white stars. In his \\"Historical Review\\", Jos√© de Villamil states that on October 9, 1820 \\"...by arrangement of the Junta (Government) was deployed the independent Guayaquil flag composed of five horizontal strips, three blue and two white and in the one from the center (blue) three stars...\\". Within the history of the Ecuadorian flag, this flag is considered the 4th national flag, which flamed on the battlefield, as the insignia of the Yaguachi Battalion, during the victory of the independentist troops over the Spanish troops in the Battle of Pichincha. Within the republican history, it is the second one, if the red flag with a white X-cross is supposed to be valid, which was supposedly the one of August 10, 1809. In practice, it is the first flag that represented a truly free territory as that today is Ecuador. There is still confusion about the representation of the 3 stars of the central strip. It's believed that the stars represent the 3 main provinces of the Royal Audience of Quito, these being: Quito, Cuenca and Guayaquil.

The Chad Basin witnessed an upsurge of insurgent activity from early November 2018, as rebels belonging to the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram launched offensives and several raids to regain military strength and seize territory in a renewed attempt to establish an Islamic state in the region. These attacks, especially those by ISWAP, met with considerable success and resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The member states of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF), namely Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon responded to the increased insurgent activity with counter- offensives. These operations repulsed the rebels in many areas, but failed to fully contain the insurgency.  Background  The Salafi jihadist Boko Haram movement launched an insurgency against the Nigerian government following an unsuccessful uprising in 2009. Supported by several other Jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda, the group aimed at establishing an Islamic state in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram greatly increased its power and territorial holdings in the Chad Basin in 2014, and its de facto leader Abubakar Shekau consequently attempted to increase his international standing among Islamists by allying with the prominent Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Boko Haram thus became the \\"Islamic State's West Africa Province\\" (ISWAP). When the insurgents were subsequently defeated and lost almost all of their lands during the 2015 West African offensive by the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF), a coalition of Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon, discontent grew among the rebels. Shekau had always refused to fully submit to ISIL's central command, and the latter consequently removed him as leader of ISWAP in August 2016. Shekau responded by breaking with ISIL's central command, but many of the rebels actually stayed loyal to ISIL. As result, the rebel movement split into a Shekau-loyal faction (\\"Jama'at Ahl al-sunna li-l-Da'wa wa-l-Jihad\\", generally known as \\"Boko Haram\\"), and a pro-ISIL faction led by Abu Musab al- Barnawi (which continued to call itself \\"Islamic State's West Africa Province\\"). These two groups have since clashed with each other, though it is possible that they still occasionally cooperate against their common enemies, namely the local governments. In addition, Shekau did never officially renounce his pledge of allegiance to ISIL as a whole; his forces are thus occasionally regarded as \\"second branch of ISWAP\\". Overall, the relation of Shekau with ISIL remains confused and ambiguous. As the Islamist rebels were driven back into more remote areas and became embroiled in infighting, local governments claimed that the insurgency had been defeated.  Prelude  Visual representation of Boko Haram fighters After their massive losses in 2015, Barnawi's ISWAP and Shekau's Boko Haram both reconsolidated, though ISWAP grew into the more powerful group. Whereas Shekau had about 1,000 to 1,500 fighters under his command by late 2018, the Islamic State loyalists counted about 3,000 to 3,500 troops. Furthermore, ISWAP displayed signs of increasing sophistication and growing connections to ISIL's core group. Barnawi's followers did not just align ideologically with ISIL, but also adopted its technologies and tactics. They began using suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and drones which experts considered proofs of support and advice by exiled ISIL members from Syria and Iraq. In addition, ISWAP deviated from Shekau's brutal and autocratic leadership style by organzining a powerful shura or committee that gave the group an element of \\"democracy\\". As result, ISWAP gained more popular support, yet also became more prone to leadership struggles. As ISWAP grew closer to its parent organization, it also became more hardline in its policies, resulting in a renewed internal struggles. Following the Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapping in February 2018, ISIL central command ordered the purge of Mamman Nur and his followers within ISWAP. Although Nur was a close ally of Barnawi and had risen to the de facto leader of ISWAP (with Barnawi serving as figurehead), the order was carried out, and Nur killed by his comrades. As he was believed to be a moderate, Nur's death was interpreted as sign that ISWAP was directed by the ISIL central leadership to fully restart its war against the local governments which resulted in the Chad Basin campaign from late 2018. Furthermore, ISWAP and Boko Haram agreed to a ceasefire, allowing both groups to focus yet again on their insurgency. It has also been speculated that ISWAP decided to become more aggressive in order to prevent al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin from gaining influence in Nigeria, especially as another Islamic State faction in West Africa (namely the \\"Islamic State in the Greater Sahara\\") had lost numerous of its fighters to defections to al-Qaeda.  Campaign   Insurgent offensives  Boko Haram vehicles which were destroyed by the Cameroonian military in Amchide in December 2018. ISWAP began to launch a series of intense attacks on Nigerian Army positions near Lake Chad from early November 2018, scoring a number of victories (most notably near Metele) and killing over a hundred government troops between 18 and 22 November. Following the success of these raids, ISWAP overran and captured the village of Kangarwa near Lake Chad, where it also seized military equipment such as one tank. Though Kangarwa is a small settlement, and strategically not important, it demonstrated the militants' ability to still conquer and hold territory. Insurgents also launched several raids into Niger in course of November, kidnapping about a dozen girls from border villages. Shekau's Boko Haram launched at least one major attack in November, raiding a military base in Borno State. Rebel forces also targeted some villages in northern Cameroon, prompting local authorities to reactivate a number of village self-defense militias. The Islamic State fighters continued their offensive in Borno State by attacking and reportedly capturing Arege on 30 November after a failed attempt two days earlier, and also launched further raids on Nigerian Army positions. Military bases which were attacked, though not captured by ISWAP, included Gambaru (1 December), Buni Gari (3 December), Mallam Fatori (3 December), and Gudumbali (4 and 14 December). In contrast, ISWAP managed to capture the villages of Cross Kauwa, Kukawa, Kekeno, and Bunduram sometime in December, and also overran a base at Mairari on 17 December, though retreated from it shortly afterward. Meanwhile, Shekau's Boko Haram also increased its attacks, though to a lesser extent than ISWAP, and began to greatly increase its propaganda output. ISWAP attacked the harbor town of Baga at the shore of Lake Chad on the night of 26‚Äì27 December, and overran its garrison after heavy fighting. The local military base was plundered, the local Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF) headquarters destroyed, and the naval base set aflame, while the militants managed to take control of tanks, APCs, boats, and much other equipment. Hundreds of local civilians fled the town after the takeover, even though the rebels had pledged to leave the local civilians alone. With the fall of Baga, rebels controlled most of Lake Chad's shoreline. The MJTF troops that survived the attack on Baga retreated to another harbor base at Fish Dam in Monguno. Miltants launched three attacks on Monguno on 29‚Äì30 December, though these were repulsed. At the same time, the MJTF member states began to prepare counter- offensives in order to push the insurgents back. The Nigerian Army was preparing a counter-attack to retake Baga by 31 December, though ISWAP still held the town by mid-February 2019. In contrast, an offensive by Niger reportedly met with more success. The Niger Armed Forces began to target islands on Lake Chad, and the area along the Yobe River at the Niger-Nigeria border from 28 December. While the Niger Army advanced on the ground, the Niger Air Force launched intense airstrikes, with the Nigerien government claiming to have killed 287 rebels by 2 January 2019. The Cameroonian Armed Forces also mobilized their troops in the north to counter the Islamist rebels. Rapid Intervention Battalion in Maroua during counter-insurgency operations on 17 January 2019 On 13 January, ISWAP attacked a military base near Magumeri. On the following day, Shekau's Boko Haram attacked the refugee town of Rann which had been reportedly abandoned by its Nigerian garrison shortly before. The insurgents proceeded to destroy much of the settlement, including local clinics, causing much of the local civilian population to flee, with about 9,000 crossing the border and relocating to Bodo in Cameroon. ISWAP also raided Gajiram on 16 January. In the next days, the Nigerian Army and Cameroonian Armed Forces retook Rann. Authorities consequently forced most of the refugees who had fled to Camerron to return to Nigeria. On 23 January, the Cameroonian military retreated from Rann, whereupon the Nigerian soldiers also withdrew, as they considered the town undefendable without Cameroonian help. About 35,000 residents of Rann promptly fled, believing that Boko Haram would surely return with the government troops gone. Most relocated to Goura in Cameroon, and this time the authorities allowed them to stay. As expected, Boko Haram indeed raided Rann after its garrison had left, setting the settlement ablaze, and murdering 60 people, including the local elders. More people subsequently fled, with about 60,000 being displaced in the region by early February. Overall, 39 insurgent attacks were recorded in Nigeria's Borno and Yobe States in January 2019, while five attacks took place in Cameroon from 1 to 22 January. A series of clashes between the Nigerian military and ISWAP occurred near Mallam Fatori at the Nigerian-Nigerien border in early February, with both sides claiming to have inflicted heavy casualties on their opponents. From 14 to 16 February, insurgents launched a number of major attacks, targeting Maiduguri, Buni Yadi in Yobe State, and the border village of Chetima Wangou in Niger. Whereas the rebels managed to capture a military base near Maiduguri, the assaults on Buni Yadi and Chetima Wangou were reportedly repelled amid heavy insurgent casualties, including several military vehicles.  Operation Yancin Tafki   Initial government successes and deposition of Abu Musab al-Barnawi as ISWAP leader  Rapid Intervention Battalion Ratel IFVs in Maroua, January 2019 Around 21 February 2019, the MJTF coalition launched an offensive codenamed Operation Yancin Tafki around Lake Chad in order to drive the rebels back, and destroy their bases in the Lake Chad region. As part of this operation, about 500 Chadian soldiers entered Nigeria to assist the Nigerian military in its home areas. Nevertheless, terror attacks and continued offensive operations by the insurgents greatly hindered the general elections in northeastern Nigeria on 23 February 2019. Most notably, ISWAP fired several Grad rockets at Magumeri, and launched an unsuccessful attack on Geidam, while Boko Haram assaulted Gwoza. Several other, smaller clashes also took place on 23 February. As part of Operation Yancin Tafki, MJTF increasingly began to apply pressure on the insurgents around Lake Chad from late February. The air forces of the coalition states struck several rebel camps and vehicles around Lake Chad, reportedly weakening ISWAP significantly. Insurgent \\"logistics bases\\" near Dorou (west of Damasak), Arege, Abadam, Dagaya, Tumbum Gini, and Tumbun Rego had reportedly been destroyed by 11 March 2019. Heavy fighting also took place along the Nigerian-Nigerien border, as ISWAP troops attacked Gueskerou and the Niger Armed Forces responded with counter-attacks near Lake Chad. At the same time, reports emerged according to which Abu Musab al-Barnawi had been deposed as governor of ISWAP, and been replaced by Ba Idrisa (better known by his alias \\"Abu Abdullah Idris ibn Umar al-Barnawi\\"). The leadership change was initially not confirmed by either the Islamic State or ISWAP, leading to speculation about whether the reports were true, and why Abu Musab al-Barnawi had been deposed. MJTF claimed that his dismissal was the result of the successes of Operation Yancin Tafki. MNJTF Chief of Military Public Information Col. Timothy Antigha also argued that the coalition's intense air attacks had greatly damaged the insurgents' supply lines as well as undermined their morale. It was later confirmed that Abu Musab al-Barnawi had been demoted to shura member, though the reasoning behind his deposition as ISWAP leader remained unclear. Despite suffering several defeats and the leadership change in February and March, ISWAP did not become passive. It continued to launch offensive operations and counter-attacks, and still achieved a number of minor victories against the security forces. The Islamic State forces also became more active in Niger in course of March, repeatedly attacking Diffa, Toumour, and smaller villages. About 18,480 people were displaced due to these attacks, while the overall number of refugees in the wider Diffa region rose to 250,000, half of them Nigerians who had fled the violence in their home country. Following the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani's official end on 23 March, ISIL affiates around the world launched a \\"Vengeance for Sham\\" campaign. ISWAP took part in the revenge campaign as well, bombarding Diffa with Grad rockets in late March and early April. The Islamic State loyalists also attacked and destroyed a military base at the village of Miringa in Borno State on 27 March, though Nigerian soldiers were able to fend off an assault on the village itself. On 4 April, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned of a \\"rapid deterioration of the security situation\\" in the Lake Chad region. Insurgents launched numerous raids in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon in April. These included minor attacks on checkpoints, suicide bombings, and larger cross-border operations involving inghimasi elite fighters. Notable rebel raids targeted Diffa, Bohama in Lac Province and Tchakamari in the Far North Region. At the same time, coalition forces continued their counter-insurgency campaign. One major joint Nigerian- Chadian operation aimed at evicting insurgents from the Ngala-Gamboru area in Borno State, where they had reportedly sought refuge after retreating from advancing government forces. Heavy clashes took place at the villages of Wulgo, Tumbuma, Chikun Gudu and Bukar Maryam, with the coalition claiming that they had won a victory. About 2,000 civilians were forcibly relocated from Jakana near Maiduguri by the Nigerian Army. Officials declared that this was part of preparations for offensive operations against ISWAP routes between their bases in Buni Yadi (Yobe) and Benisheikh forest (Borno). Fighting also continued in the area around Cross Kauwa on 15‚Äì16 April, with both sides claiming to have eliminated enemy vehicles and troops.  Renewed rebel offensives  On 25 April, Nigerian Defense Minister Mansur Dan Ali declared that \\"the Boko Haram terror network has been overwhelmed and the leadership structure is presently decimated\\". Analyst Andrew McGregor commented this claim by noting that \\"despite the Nigerian Army's repeated claims of imminent victory, villagers and forest workers continue to be slaughtered\\" by the insurgents. Two days later, ISWAP launched a major attack on the military base at Mararrabar Kimba, using motorcycles, 12 technicals as well as three armoured personnel carriers. The Nigerian defenders were overrun, and forced to retreat, whereupon the rebels captured much military equipment and withdrew with their loot. By late April, analysts estimated that ISWAP had grown to between 5,000 and 18,000 fighters, and had begun to raise taxes around Lake Chad. In early May, ISWAP attacked the town of Gajiganna, Borno, where it destroyed the local barracks before retreating. In the same month, Shekau's Boko Haram faction initiated a series of attacks near Lake Chad, targeting Bama, Banki, Ngom, Tungunshe, and Maiduguri. These operations, far north of Shekau's traditional base of power, were possibly the first ones carried out by the newly organized \\"Bakura Faction\\", a militia led by an individual only known as \\"Bakura\\". In June, ISWAP launched a series of attacks around Lake Chad, targeting Nigerian and Chadian forces. In response, the Chadian government decided to restore a \\"red zone\\" in Lac Region where it had previously banned fishing and grazing. This \\"red zone\\" had been intended to separate the rebels from the population and reduced their access to food, yet had been allowed to lapse. On 25 May, Shekau's Boko Haram faction released a video eulogizing dead fighters, one of whom was Man Chari (alias \\"Abu Sadiq al-Bamawi\\"). Chari had been a high-ranking commander and long-time Shekau loyalist; analyst Jacob Zenn argued that Chari had probably been killed in combat. In September, rebels launched several raids against villages and military posts along the Nigerian-Cameroonian border. Many civilians and several soldiers were killed, while the insurgents retreated with captured livestock, weapons, and ammunition. Cameroon's chief of defense staff General Ren√© Claude Meka responded by shifting more troops to the border. The sporadic border raids into Cameroon were continuing as of December 2019. By this time, the Cameroonian government declared that \\"122 Boko Haram terrorists\\" had surrendered to Cameroonian security forces in the course of 2019. By February 2020, Operation Yancin Tafki was concluded, and the 1,200 Chadian troops which had been operating in Nigeria as part of the operation were withdrawn. Nigerian Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai declared that the insurgent forces had been driven back to a large degree. Though admitting that the rebels remained active, he downplayed the latter's more recent successes as being part of a \\"minimal resurgence\\". Heavy fighting continued, however, as Nigerian forces began an assault on Baga to retake it from ISWAP. Meanwhile, ISWAP began to experience extensive internal struggles, as its commander Ba Idrisa was deposed. Bo Lawan (alias \\"Lawan Abubakar\\") succeeded him, and promptly purged ISWAP's shura of suspected dissenters, reportedly imprisoning Ba Idrisa and four top commanders loyal to him, namely Mohammad Bashir, Mustapha Jere, Ali Abdullahi, and Baba Mayinta. Unidentified sources claimed that ISWAP experienced a mutiny on 26‚Äì27 February that resulted in the execution of the five imprisoned commanders, the desertation of another commander, Mustapha Kirmimma, while former ISWAP leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi was shot in the confusion, his fate unclear. However, this information remained unverifiable.  Aftermath  Chadian troops return to N'Djamena on 13 April 2020 after having taken part in Operation Boma's Wrath Despite the infighting among its forces, ISWAP remained operational and continued to release propaganda as well as initiate attacks in northern Nigeria and southeastern Niger. Soon after the conclusion of Operation Yancin Tafki, the MJTF launched another counter-insurgency operation codenamed \\"Boma's Wrath\\". ISWAP also launched a southward offensive with several brigades, attacking Garkida in northern Adamawa State and Damboa in southern Borno. In March, the Nigerian and Nigerien militaries claimed to have killed the Boko Haram commander known as \\"Bakura\\".

While the traditional religion of the Maroons was absorbed by Christianity due to conversions in Maroon communities, many old practices continued on. Some have speculated that Jamaican Maroon religion helped the development of Kumina and Convince. The religious Kromanti dance is still practiced today but not always with the full religious connotation as in the past. History What can be deduced today about the religions origins points to the idea that it is founded upon Akan religion but syncretized with other African beliefs. This is evident by the many specifically Akan aspects found in the religion. Very little was written about the original religion of the Jamaican Maroons because of little contact Maroons had with the outside world. What was written at the time by Bryan Edwards (a British slaver and planter) was the practice of Obeah by Maroons. When Anglican Christian churches were established in Maroon towns the traditional religion began to be practiced separately from Christianity and served a different religious purpose. As other non-Anglican churches appeared in Maroon communities they rallied against traditional Maroon beliefs and they became less popular. Today the Kromanti dance still is practiced on occasion even by self identified Christians. Beliefs Cosmology According to the faith a supreme deity named Yankipong rules the cosmos and is generally unconcerned with human life. Below Yankipong exists ancestor spirits called \\"duppies\\", \\"jumbies\\", or \\"bigiman\\". These spirits have hierarchies of their own and can be communicated with by humans so their powers can be used for worldly matters. The matter of spirits and their influence on Earth is considered to be Obeah (although the use of that specific term is controversial and some instead call it \\"science\\"). It is believed that the omnipotent god \\"Yankipong\\" is the Jamaican Maroon's conception of the omnipotent god Nyame from Akan religion. Other Akan deities are reported to have been recognized like Asase Yaa and Epo. The Akan based word \\"Kumfu\\" was used for the total spiritual system and understanding of the world. Practices A priest of the religion is referred to as a \\"kumfu-man\\". The word \\"kumfu\\" itself has its origins Twi language. Ceremonies are involved in Jamaican Maroon religion but no worship of the god Yankipong is practiced, unlike in traditional Akan religion. An important ceremony of the religion is the Kromanti dance which involves the direction of a \\"fete- man\\" (ritual specialist) and the sacrifice of an animal to the pakit (ancestral spirit). The purpose of the dance is for participants to be possessed by ancestral spirits. The Jamaican Maroon Creole language is used during the Kromanti dance ceremony when addressing people possessed by old Maroon ancestors.

In physics, Moses effect is a phenomenon of deformation of the surface of a diamagnetic liquid by a magnetic field. The effect was named after Biblical figure Moses, inspired by the crossing of the Red Sea in the Old Testament. The rapid progress in the development of neodymium magnets, supplying magnetic fields as high as ca. 1 T, allows simple and inexpensive experiments related to the Moses effect and its visualization. The application of magnetic fields on the order of magnitude of 0.5-1 T results in the formation of the near-surface ‚Äúwell‚Äù with a depth of dozens of micrometers. In contrast, the surface of a paramagnetic liquid is raised by the magnetic field. This effect is called as the inverse Moses effect. It is usually latently suggested that the shape of the well arises from the interplay of magnetic force and gravity and the shape of the near-surface well is given by the following equation: :h(r)= \\\\frac{\\\\chi \\\\mathbf{B}^2(r)}{2\\\\rho g\\\\mu_0} where œá and œÅ are the magnetic susceptibility and density of the liquid respectively, B is the magnetic field, g is the gravity acceleration, and Œº0 is the magnetic permittivity of vacuum. Actually, the shape of the near surface well depends also on the surface tension of the liquid. The Moses effect enables trapping of floating diamagnetic particles and formation of micro-patterns. The application of a magnetic field (B‚âÖ0.5 T) on diamagnetic liquid/vapor interfaces enables the driving of floating diamagnetic bodies and soap bubbles.

The novel was written for the working class and meant to give a shock to its readers through its use of graphic violence among several characters and sexual promiscuity, specifically among women. It is considered by critics to fall within several genres such as sensational literature and urban gothic and to have laid the groundwork for the city mysteries genre.  Background  Sensational Urban stories such as City Crimes were extremely popular in the 1840s and 1850s, which is around when slave narratives gained traction in the public sphere. Some parts of City Crimes borrow from these slave narratives, such as Narrative of The Life of Henry Box Brown. Another contemporary genre was the domestic novel, a sort of antithesis to the more sensational novels such as City Crimes. Where domestic novels avoided topics such as the body and sexuality altogether, sensational novels strove to deliver both in a way as gripping as possible to the audience. They tended to be concerned with greed and virtue, often intertwined with sexuality (a trend which City Crimes follows), where men and women alike are cautioned to avoid or repress their sexual impulses. Sensationalist books like City Crimes tended to be considered as lesser than other types of literature, and as such sold as cheap books for travelers. They were written to appeal to a masculine audience, specifically those in cities, and books like City Crimes are seen as a reaction both to domestic novels and to the rise of urban life.Dalke, Anne French. \\"The Shameless Woman is the Worst of Men: Sexual Aggression in Nineteenth-Century Sensational Novels.\\" Studies in the Novel 18.3 (1986): 291-303.  Characters and Plot  Though the narrator generally follows the protagonist Frank Sydney, it bounces around between characters. It tends to show the city in very close-up and claustrophobic ways, as opposed to broadly, and favors individual experience over crowd experiences.Thompson, George, et al. \\"Introduction.\\" Venus in Boston: and Other Tales of Nineteenth-Century Life,. University of Massachusetts Press, 2002, pp. ix-liv. The reader follows the narrator as they reveal to the reader the dark underbelly of life in the city. It features several characters at odds with one another, chief among them being Frank Sydney and The Dead Man.  Main characters   Frank Sydney  Frank Sydney is the protagonist of the story. He is engaged to Julia Fairfield, and has an affair with Maria Archer during this time. Some of his exploits include thwarting robbers intending to steal from him and helping to rehabilitate other characters and turn them away from crime. Early on, he's a rich man who abandons his life to help people, but is quickly whisked into the crime-ridden city and finds himself the victim of extreme violence. In the course of this he stumbles into several perilous situations, including facing imprisonment and torture by The Dead Man. He's often reliant on others to help him understand this world he enters, and uses guides on his journeys into, and escape out of, The Dark Vaults.  The Dead Man  The main antagonist in City Crimes is The Dead Man. The Dead Man is a character who, in order to conceal his identity, horribly disfigured and scarred his face through chemical means. Throughout the book, he commits several violent crimes, including blinding Josephine Franklin with sulfuric acid. He held several positions in the past, including that of a physician and temperance supporter, and reveled in immorality in these roles until he eventually turned to remorseless murder and crime. When the book takes place, he lives in the underground \\"Dark Vaults\\", characterized by violence, cannibalism, sexual taboos such as incest, and decaying animals and human corpses. His familial ties begin when he murder's a woman's husband, blinds and murders her two children, and has two children by her. One is called \\"The Image\\", and is a ghoulish subhuman creature that lives hidden away. The other is a criminal child taught to disregard morality and seek success in criminal acts. Some of his other wicked deeds in the book include torture, rape, mutilation, and arson. At the end of the story, he, after undergoing torture himself, is blown up and thus killed.  Maria Archer  Maria Archer is a prostitute who witnessed her parents cheat on each other as a child. This marked the beginning of her slip into social and moral decay, which culminates in her husband, Fred, forcing her into prostitution. Due to her upbringing and oppressive husband, her prostitution is partially apologized for by the narrator, though she still ends up dead (like the other women in the novel) at the hands of her husband when she refuses to keep paying him the money she earns. Later on, Fred becomes trapped in a vault and suffocates within, meeting his end.  Julia Fairfield  Julia Fairfield, while in a relationship with Frank Sydney, resists Frank physically, and has an affair with the African-American servant Nero. Frank is furious with her for cheating on him and separates from her, an act which Julia celebrates as it gives her newfound freedom to pursue her desires. As a result of this affair, Julia becomes pregnant. She kills the child of the affair with Nero soon after giving birth to it, then moves on from her relationship with Frank Sydney to a man named Mr. Hedge. Julia marries Mr. Hedge for his money, which facilitates her lifestyle, until eventually she kills him and then herself.  Sophia Franklin  The only non-sexually aggressive woman in the novel is Sophia Franklin. She is fully non-sexual, rebuffing advances made on her, until she unites with Frank Sydney at the end of the book. She is upheld by the narrator as a pillar of good, and is meant as the example to be followed for women. Beyond this, she plays an insignificant role in the story. Her sister Josephine and mother Lucretia, however, are both incredibly deviant sexually and morally, and greatly overshadow her in the book. Lucretia connives with Josephine to have her husband, Edgar Franklin, killed, so she may pursue her desires with pride, and encourages her daughters to do the same. After being blinded and facially disfigured by The Dead Man, Josephine marries a man named Thurston, and, upon the reveal that her face is now horrifically scarred, both parties kill themselves.  Genre  City Crimes belongs to a number of different genres, one of which being sensationalist literature. As a member of the sensationalists, City Crimes emphasizes decadence in city life. The genre tended to highlight the downsides of the urban world, and uphold the idea of the simple rural life. Part of this emphasis on urban ills involves showing what they dub the \\"real\\" world, as opposed to what readers would want to see the real world as.White, Zaren. \\"(Illicit) Sex and the City: Transgressive Female Sexuality and the 'Porno Gothic' Genre in George Thompson's City Crimes.\\" at the EDGE , 2 (2012): 156-80. Retrieved 10 March 2019. Though they made use of violence and sex as shocking devices, they did so as a cautionary tale against sex and violence. Sexuality is seen as a vice as well as a tool, used by characters for financial gain and security, and is punished accordingly. This is seen in City Crimes specifically when the sexually active women, such as Maria Archer, die at the end of their arcs. City Crimes is also considered an urban gothic book, exhibiting a penchant for grotesque and deformed characters and horror elements, and considered to have lain the foundation for the City-Mysteries genre that Thompson and later writers wrote in. Thompson draws on the Gothic with his use of underground passages and hideouts, supernatural-seeming entities, and disfigured servants of evil such as The Dead Man and his hidden dwarf-like child \\"The Image\\". This is further exemplified with the use of scenes of graphic violence.  Reception  City Crimes draws from the life of Henry Box Brown. The reception of City Crimes at the time of publication was fairly negative, and remained as such for much of its existence. Overall, for contemporary readers and for critics reading when it was first published, City Crimes has a mixed reception. One criticism by Carl Ostrowski of City Crimes is that Thompson profits off of slave narratives, such as that of Henry Box Brown. In Henry Box Brown's narrative, he escapes slavery by physically mailing himself away in a package. He prepared a few supplies for his journey, but was met with a new trouble when the box he encased himself in was stored upside-down for transit. As a result, Henry wrote of painful complications involving the blood rushing to his head. Drawing from this, in City Crimes, the antagonist, The Dead Man, does the same thing, mailing himself out of Sing Sing prison and encountering the torment of being stored upside-down. Thompson makes a few changes to Henry Box Brown's story as he details a grotesque flow of blood from The Dead Man, while also sizing up the dimensions of the box as compared to Henry Box Brown's. The connection between The Dead Man's fictional trouble and Henry Box Brown's factual experience is further strengthened by the fact that City Crimes was published soon after Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, which suggests the prison escape of Thompson's was adapted from Henry Box Brown's work. Another criticism by Zaren White is that City Crimes is pornographic in its extreme interpretation of the Gothic genre and treats male and female sexuality differently. Where both are criticized, sexual women in the novel are killed and meet terrible fates, where sexual men are apologized for. Further, male sexuality isn't connected as closely to crimes such as murder as female sexuality is. Scholars such as David S. Reynolds, however, assert that, though City Crimes and sensational novels like City Crimes have been shunned by critics, they have a place in the greater context of literature. Sensational literature like City Crimes was cheaper than the other side of the literary coin of the time, domestic novels, and had an incredibly wide readership, making City Crimes, as a popular sensational novel, an important part of literary history. Further, City Crimes subverted the status quo in terms ideas of institutions and power, as well as prevalent ideas of righteousness, and helped open up the idea that literature didn't have to have a distinct moral compass.  Analysis  Throughout City Crimes, the sexuality of women is something to be repressed and fought against. Any deviation from the sexual norm for women is punished in the story. Female sexuality and crime are linked together, creating an association in the narrative between sex and immorality. It seeks to be a cautionary tale about rampant sexuality, and swings from explicit violence to heavily implicit sexual encounters. It seeks also to show the failings of the city's moral fiber and use exciting material to grab a reader's attention. To keep this interest, it employs use of titillating images and couples it with shocking revelations. City Crimes also has several social concerns, such as a concern for the danger of being a prostitute and the reluctant life of prostitution in the city, as illustrated by Maria Archer, and some concerns for working class struggles. It's also very concerned with class structure. Thompson portrays the rich as enemies of the middle class, and while the protagonist is a rich man, he's associated with the \\"lower\\" classes, and is abandoned by his upper echelons (who he also doesn't hesitate to criticize). Thompson also illustrates how the rich are held less accountable than other people when, in one scene, a police officer pardons Frank when he finds out who he is, disgusting frank. A judge pardons another character, Dr. Sinclair, in a similar fashion, and is also depicted stealing money through the corrupt legal system. It then continues with social commentary to bemoan how prisoners are treated excessively poorly. Religious systems are also up for scrutiny, as Thompson showcases drunken temperance speakers and other hypocrisies of priests and reverends. City Crimes, as a city-mysteries novel, appealed mainly to the working class, and used an underlying upset with the upper class as a means to be relatable for the working class readership. Upper-class people being immoral and wicked in the book tended to be the result of such a design, and the book portrayed itself as shining a light on something unspoken in society. For example, after The Dead Man mails himself out of Sing Sing Prison, he arrives at a warehouse, where, from within the box, he overhears the owner boast about taking advantage of prison labor to pay lower wages. He also overhears the same man say his insurance will no longer be covering the warehouse. He burns down the warehouse in the name of the working class, making the scene a sort of sympathetic scene for The Dead Man to Thompson's readership (middle class workers). In this way, Thompson utilizes and warps what was effective about Henry Box Brown's narrative to appeal to a different audience, including language such as \\"master\\" to keep a similar emotional attachment.  Publication  City Crimes was published in the newspaper Sporting Chronicle on September 1, 1849, under the pseudonym \\"Greenhorn.\\" It was then published again in two parts, with the first part being published in June 1850 in Police Gazette. City Crimes was also included in a book list in The Miscellany in 1857, though Thompson himself was never explicitly mentioned.

Milford was built at Devonport Dockyard in 1931‚Äì1932. Milford served during the Second World War, and was sold in 1949. Construction and design The British Admiralty ordered four sloops as part of the 1930 construction programme, with two each ordered from Devonport and Chatham dockyards. Classified as repeat Shoreham or Falmouth-class ships, they, like the four Shoreham-class sloops ordered under the 1929 construction programme, were a lengthened and improved version of the of the 1928 programme, which were themselves a modification of the . They were intended for a dual role of patrol service in overseas stations in peacetime and minesweeping during war. Milford was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of at full load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Two Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers fed two geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ship's main gun armament consisted of two 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk V guns mounted fore-and-aft on the ship's centreline, with the forward gun on a High-Angle (HA) anti-aircraft mounting and the aft gun on a Low-Angle (LA) mounting, suitable only for use against surface targets. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ship's gun armament. The initial anti-submarine armament consisted of four depth charges. The ship had a crew of 100 officers and other ranks. Milford was ordered from Devonport Dockyard on 24 April 1931 and was laid down on 14 September 1931. She was launched on 11 June 1932 and completed on 22 December 1932. Modifications Milfords anti-aircraft armament was improved during refits in 1937 and 1939 by replacing the aft LA 4-inch gun by a HA gun, and adding a quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount for close-in anti-aircraft duties. A second quadruple .50 machine gun mount was added in 1940, with the machine guns replaced by four (later five) Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon later in the war. The ship's anti-submarine armament was also gradually increased during the war, with the number of depth charges carried increasing from 15 to as many as 60‚Äì90. Other wartime changes included the fitting of radar. Service On commissioning, Milford joined the Africa Station, operating off both the west and east coast of Africa. In February 1934, she visited Bouvet Island in the far South Atlantic, carrying out survey operations and confirming the location of the remote island. Milford returned to the UK for refitting at Potrsmouth Dockyard in May 1935, having sailed over 50,000 miles in her first commission. After this refit, she returned to the Africa Station, and was refitted again at Portsmouth from October to December 1937. In March 1938, Milford visited Tristan da Cunha, and she was refitted at Simonstown in South Africa in January to May 1939. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 saw the Africa Station being renamed the South Atlantic Station, with Milford transferring to her war station at Freetown, Sierra Leone. Milford was used to escort convoys between South Africa and Gibraltar, before undergoing another refit at Simonstown from January to March 1940. On 7 July 1940, Milford, together with the aircraft carrier and the cruisers and , arrived off Dakar, Senegal, in order to force French Navy ships (especially the battleship ) to either join with the Royal Navy or be neutralised so they could not be seized by the Germans (a similar operation had resulted in the British attack on Mers-el-K√©bir on 3 July). Milford attempted to enter Dakar harbour with an emissary to carry out negotiations, but the French refused entry. On the morning of 7/8 July a launch from Hermes sneaked past the French defences and dropped a number of depth charges under Richelieus stern, then Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from Hermes attacked Richelieu, scoring one torpedo hit on the battleship, badly damaging the French ship. On 23 September 1940, Milford took part in Operation Menace, an unsuccessful attempt to seize Dakar by landing Free French forces with Royal Navy support.

After some time derelict, and a major fire, it was demolished in 2018.  History  The derelict pub in July 2016 - note missing roof Parts of the building dated from the late 17th or early 18th century. A public house had stood on the site, at 16 Freeman Street, on the corner of in Park Street, since at least 1829, and possibly as early as 1815. The name \\"Fox and Grapes\\", which refers to one of Aesop's Fables, The Fox and the Grapes, was in use by 1849. The facade was remodelled in the mid 19th century. The pub was owned by Smiths Brewery, until taken over by Butlers (later Mitchell & Butlers), in 1957. One wing of the stuccoed brick building, which had a tiled roof, included a former coach house. The already-derelict building was badly damaged by fire on the afternoon of 3 January 2015 - an incident which was attended by eight fire appliances from the West Midlands Fire Service. The building was given grade II listed status in July 1982, legally protecting it from unauthorised alteration or demolition. Despite this designation, the building was demolished overnight on 15/16 September 2018 - a Saturday and Sunday. The demolition was strongly criticised by the city's leading historian, Professor Carl Chinn, who described the act as being \\"as mystifying as it is upsetting and disgusting\\". Birmingham City Council said that the demolition was \\"part of the HS2 Curzon Street Station development\\", referring to construction of the northern terminus of phase one of the High Speed 2 railway, nearby, and citing \\"structural issues\\" identified by \\"HS2's surveyors\\".

Dr Warren Feeney has referred to him as \\"alongside [David] Low [...] undoubtedly New Zealand's most famous international illustrator\\".  Early life  Colvin was born in Dunedin and educated at Otago Boys' High School. His skill in illustration and satire were already evident at high school, where he contributed cartoons and caricatures to the school's quarterly magazine. His school career appears to have been successful: \\"He was a member of the first eleven cricket team and a scholar in English, Chemistry and Latin, as well as a regimental sergeant- major of the cadet corps and head boy in his final year.\\" He attended the Dunedin Training College between 1938 and 1940, training to be a teacher and studying for an arts degree.  Career  Colvin volunteered for World War II, initially training as a commando in Australia before being conscripted into the Second Expeditionary Forces (2NZEF). He arrived in Egypt in October 1941, working as a draughtsman. When Peter McIntyre took on the role of war artist, Colvin took over his role as 'camp humorist', contributing regular cartoons to the 2NZEF Times. It was during this time that he developed the soldier characters Johnny Enzed and Fred Clueless. The latter has been described by Ian F Grant as, alongside Gordon Minhinnick's Soldier Sam, New Zealanders' 'best-loved cartoon characters' during the War. Colvin's reputation as a cartoonist was well established through is work on the 2NZEF Times when he returned to New Zealand. He took up the high-profile role of editorial cartoonist for the Evening Post in 1946, a post he held until 1956. Colvin emigrated to England in 1956, having become 'increasingly frustrated with criticism of his work by senior staff at the Evening Post' and, more generally, with the stifling environment of 1950s New Zealand. He soon found work on Fleet Street, working for the News Chronicle, Daily Telegraph, News of the World, the Daily Sketch, the Daily Express, and the Sunday Express. He branched out into serialized newspaper strips in the 1960s, working on a number of titles before, most famously, working on the comic strip Modesty Blaise.

The event took place on August 3, 2019, at the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. It was the eighth consecutive Tripleman√≠a to be held at the arena, and marked the 27th year in a row that AAA had held a Tripleman√≠a show, and the 32nd overall show held under the Tripleman√≠a banner since 1993. The annual Tripleman√≠a show is AAA's biggest event of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl. In the main event match, Blue Demon Jr. successfully defended his mask and won the hair of Dr. Wagner Jr. in a Lucha de Apuestas; after the match Wagner announced his retirement from professional wrestling. Other featured matches saw former UFC Heavyweight Champion Cain Velasquez make his professional wrestling debut and new AAA World Mixed Tag Team, AAA World Trios and Reina de Reinas champions crowned. Wrestlers from the American promotions All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and Impact Wrestling - with which AAA has partnerships - also appeared on the card. Production Background Outdoor view of the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico building. 2019 marked the 27th year that the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (Triple A or AAA) has held their annual flagship Tripleman√≠a show and the 31st overall Tripleman√≠a show promoted by AAA (AAA promoted multiple Tripleman√≠a shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997). Since the 2012 event, Tripleman√≠a has taken place at the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico (Mexico City Arena), an indoor arena in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, Mexico that has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. Tripleman√≠a XXVII is the eighth consecutive Tripleman√≠a (XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV and XXVI) held at the venue. AAA's Tripleman√≠a is their biggest show of the year, AAA's equivalent of WWE's WrestleMania or New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom event. Storylines Tripleman√≠a XXVII featured eight professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in wrestling matches. On August 25, 2018 at Tripleman√≠a XXVI, L.A. Park won the P√≥ker de Ases four-way steel cage match, forcing El Hijo del Fantasma to unmask. After the match, Rey Wagner came to the ring and challenged L.A. Park to bet his mask at Tripleman√≠a XXVII, a challenge that was accepted by L.A. Park. However, in October 2018, L.A. Park left AAA, citing his unhappiness with how the company was treating him. On October 26 at H√©roes Inmortales XII, Blue Demon Jr. betrayed Rey Wagner during Wagner's match against Jeff Jarrett, which Wagner still won. In December, Blue Demon Jr. continued to cement his role as Rey Wagner's rival. On February 10, Wagner emerged victorious against Blue Demon Jr. in a Street Fight and that same night, challenged Demon to a Lucha de Apuestas, a challenge that was not answered at the time. On February 27, AAA announced that Blue Demon Jr. and Rey Wagner will face off in a Luchas de Apuestas as the main event of Tripleman√≠a XXVII.

Barry Corporation, stylized RG Barry, is a developer and marketer of footwear, handbags, and foot care products. It was founded by Florence Melton, Aaron Zacks, and Harry Streim in 1947 in Columbus, Ohio. It is known for its Dearfoams foam insole slippers, Baggallini, and Foot Petals brands. It is headquartered in Pickerington, Ohio.  History  In the 1940s, Florence Melton had developed a removable shoulder pad. She, her husband Aaron Zacks, and businessman Harry Streim started a business called Shoulda-Moulders Co, and worked on developing slippers, bathrobes, and pillows. In 1947, the company was renamed to R.G. Barry, which was named after their children: Richard Streim, Gordon Zacks and Barry Zacks. In 1949, R.G. Barry released Angel Treads, the first foam-cushioned, washable slipper, as one of their featured products. The Dearfoams slipper brand was introduced in 1958. Following the launch of Dearfoams, R.G. Barry added operations in Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, North Carolina, and New York, in an effort to boost company business. R.G. Barry went public in 1962, and was listed in the American Stock Exchange. In 1965, Gordon Zacks became the company president, In 1974, they sold the Mushrooms brand sandals and footwear. They were the subject of a trademark lawsuit with Mushroom Makers, which sold women's sportswear. Sales of Mushrooms were reported to have peaked at $120 million in 1978. The company would later sell the Mushroom brand to United States Shoe Corporation in 1982. In 1979, Gordon Zacks became Chairman of the Board and CEO Following a reorganization effort in the 1980s, Dearfoams launched a line of men's slippers and redesigned its women's line with an emphasis on ‚Äúgiftability‚Äù R.G. Barry also broadened its retail distribution, branching out from department stores to mass merchandisers like Kmart and Wal-Mart. The company launched a series of television commercials promoting Dearfoams. In 2004, Zacks stepped down from his position due to disappointing sales. The company had also closed its plants in Mexico. Thomas von Lehman served as the interim CEO, and in 2006, Greg Tunney, formerly with Phoenix Footwear, became the new CEO. In February 2008, the company switched its listings from American Stock Exchange to NASDAQ (). In January 2011, R.G. Barry acquired the Foot Petals brand, from a Long Beach-based insole maker . The company was founded by Tina Aldatz in 2001 with products for high heels wearers, and has since expanded to various footwear. In March 2011, R.G. Barry acquired the Baggallini brand, from a maker of handbags and travel accessories, in a $33.8 million deal. Baggallini was started by two Delta Airlines flight attendants Dixie Powers and Ann Simmons in 1996 when they were selling currency bags to airline employees in airport lounges. On September 3, 2014, R.G. Barry was taken private by Mill Road Capital and The Blackstone Group. In November 2017, Greg Tunney stepped down as CEO. Bob Mullaney, former COO of Shoes.com was named the CEO in December. In 2017, the Pickerington City Council voted to help fund an upgrade to the company in order for it to keep its presence in the city and grow its employee base from 100 to 120 jobs.

LDT values are relevant to both transmissive and reflective optical elements and in applications where the laser induced modification or destruction of a material is the intended outcome.  Mechanisms   Thermal  For long pulses or continuous wave lasers the primary damage mechanism tends to be thermal. Since both transmitting and reflecting optics both have non-zero absorption, the laser can deposit thermal energy into the optic. At a certain point, there can be sufficient localized heating to either affect the material properties or induce thermal shock.  Dielectric breakdown  Dielectric breakdown occurs in insulating materials whenever the electric field is sufficient to induce electrical conductivity. Although this concept is more common in the context of DC and relatively low frequency AC electrical engineering the electromagnetic fields from a pulsed laser can be sufficient to induce this effect, causing damaging structural and chemical changes to the optic.  Avalanche breakdown  For very short, high power pulses, avalanche breakdown can occur. At these exceptionally high intensities, multiphoton absorption can cause the rapid ionization of atoms of the optic. This plasma readily absorbs the laser energy, leading to the liberation of more electrons and a run-away \\"avalanche\\" effect, capable of causing significant damage to the optic.  Mitigation  Optical systems can mitigate the effects of laser damage both by increasing the LDT of the optics used and by changing the laser beam characteristics. The use of high reflectivity (HR) dielectric mirrors instead of metal mirrors is a common strategy. Further, the beam can be expanded, reducing the fluence present on optics. Finally, the beam can be temporally stretched, i.e. \\"chirped\\", to reduce the power incident on the optic. The use of chirped beams was the key innovation in chirped pulse amplification, a technique which permits the generation of petawatt class beams which was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Applications  Some applications make use of laser breakdown directly, necessitating knowledge of the materials' LDT properties. Some examples include: * Laser cutting * Pulsed laser deposition * Certain laser medicine techniques * Plasma generation, especially for wakefield acceleration * Laser weapons  External links  * Thorlabs - Laser Induced Damage Threshold Tutorial * Edmund Optics - Laser Damage Threshold Testing * Newport - Technical Note: Laser Damage Threshold * RP Photonics - Laser-Induced Damage Category:Lasers ","title":"Laser damage threshold"},{"id":"60092384","text":"Three/Three is the third studio album by American musician Tadd Mullinix, under the name Dabrye.

The bill was introduced in the 116th Congress as H.R. 1423 and S. 610. The bill‚Äôs sponsors include Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). Similar versions of this bill were previously introduced in the 115th United States Congress as H.R. 1374 and S. 2591. The FAIR Act passed the House of Representatives on September 20, 2019, by a vote of 225 to 186.  Background  Forced arbitration clauses are commonly found in contracts between individuals and businesses. In cases where individuals bring legal claims against their employer or a business, forced arbitration generally prohibits them from the choice of taking such claims to be heard in court and instead to closed-door arbitration proceedings, where they are less likely to receive an impartial hearing. Some employers have removed provisions from contracts subjecting their employees to forced arbitration amid public pressure regarding concerns that the practice inhibits the rights of workers to hold their employer accountable for allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination, and wage theft. In November of 2018, over 20,000 employees of the technology giant Google organized a walkout protest against the company in response to Google‚Äôs policies around ‚Äúequity and transparency in the workplace,‚Äù which includes forced arbitration in worker contracts. In February 2019, Google announced they were ending their policy of forced arbitration for full-time employees.

It was established in 2009 by brothers Nir and Ofer Gaist. Nir Gaist is the CTO, and Sagit Manor (a former executive at Verifone) became the CEO in 2017. The company is based in Santa Clara, CA, with an R&D; office in Herzliya, Israel.  History  In 2006 18-year-old Nir Gaist created the original concept for the technology that became Nyotron's flagship product, Paranoid. In 2007, he and Ofer traveled to Bucharest, Romania to develop the prototype. In 2008 he returned to Israel seeking support from investors. Major General (ret.) Amos Malka, former Director of Intelligence of the IDF, was among the first investors and served as Nyotron's first Chairman of the Board. In 2014, the first official version of Paranoid was shipped. In 2016, Nyotron moved its headquarters to Santa Clara, CA. The company launched the Global War Room SOC console in 2017 and began offering Paranoid as a service. This \\"Managed Detection and Response\\" (MDR) service, provided a solution for companies that require protection against advanced attackers and unknown threats, but have limited security staff. In 2018, Nyotron signed a distribution agreement with Ingram Micro. The company published an in-depth research report on the activities of the OilRig nation-state actor (aka APT34). Nyotron also joined the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO).  Paranoid Technology  Paranoid's anti- malware and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology are grounded on three realizations: * There are a handful of major Operating Systems. * Their designed (good) behavior is finite. * Their core functionality changes infrequently. Nyotron created a map of the known good behavior of the operating system in the areas where malicious activity would attempt access, such as file systems, process and thread management, networking and registry, and partition modification. This approach is called OS-Centric Positive Security, or automatic OS behavior whitelisting. The language used for describing these ‚Äúmaps‚Äù is called Behavior Patterns Mapping (BPM). This patented language does not require machine learning/artificial intelligence or any other statistical or math-based algorithm. Instead, it is deterministic. Its algorithm's complexity is O(1), which means the performance doesn't degrade with the volume of input. As its OS-Centric Positive Security approach focuses only on the ‚Äúgood‚Äù behavior of the operating system, Paranoid detects and blocks both known and unknown malware (including zero-day exploits). The company calls this ‚Äúthreat-agnostic defense‚Äù. In addition to protection, Paranoid provides visibility into the attack's timelines, root cause and attacker's methods (TTPs).  Funding  In 2015 the company raised $10 million from Mivtach Shamir Holdings and other investors. In 2017, $21 million was raised by Douglas and Sandra Bergeron, founders of DGB Investments, with other investors. In 2018 Ingram Micro made a strategic investment of $10 million.  Certifications, reviews and awards  In July 2017 Paranoid was a part of SC Magazine's Endpoint Security Group Test and received 5 out of 5 stars. The publication stated, ‚Äúfrom the perspective of breadth and depth of analytical capability, it is one of the best, if not the best, displays of its type that we have ever seen.‚Äù In September 2017, Nyotron was labeled as a ‚ÄúVendor to Watch‚Äù by Enterprise Management Associates. Nyotron was also named as a Top 50 Cyber Security Leader of 2017 by Cyber Defense magazine. In 2018, Paranoid was named ‚ÄúThe Innovator in Endpoint Security for 2018‚Äù by Cyber Defense. In September 2018, IT Central Station released a review of Paranoid, giving it 4 out of a possible 5 stars, stating ‚ÄúAll the ransomware that is now happening in many companies, this product is a solution for that. Ransomware is like a virus and transforms - it's changing every day. This product really is the best solution for this security issue. It's protecting the end-point from a ransomware threat.‚Äù In October 2018, ICSA Labs released a report, stating Nyotron's Paranoid was ICSA Labs certified in Advanced Threat Defense. The report goes on to say that Nyotron detected 100% of the 441 malicious samples tested, and had only 1 false positive out of 721 innocuous apps in the test. In February 2019, Nyotron won silver Cybersecurity Excellence Awards in the categories of Most Innovative Cybersecurity Company and Advanced Persistent Threat Protection.

Biography Morris was born Moritz Beisinger on January 21, 1838 to a Jewish family in Hechingen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg Germany. His family raised cattle. In 1848, his family's property was confiscated during the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49 and young Moritz was sent to the United States to live with an uncle in New England. In the US, he changed his name to Nelson \\"Nels\\" Morris. At the age of 15, he left his uncle to work in a succession of jobs first as a coal miner in Pennsylvania and then on a canal boat which took him to Buffalo and then on a lake ship which took him to Michigan City, Indiana, and finally to Chicago in 1853 where he worked at a stockyard. Leveraging his skills learned by observing his father in southern Germany, he became very successful as a cattle trader which allowed him to buy a slaughterhouse and butcher shop; and eventually a lucrative relationship with the Union Army during the American Civil War. His business continued to grow and by the 1880s, Morris & Company had over 60 buildings in Chicago employing 3,700 and slaughtering 5,000 cattle, 10,000 pigs, 6,000 sheep, and 1,000 calves per day. At the time of his death, company sales were $100 million and had 100 branches throughout the country. Morris served on various boards. In 1872, he was named as the first Jewish director at the First National Bank of Chicago; he also served as a director at the Drovers Bank which serviced the stockyards. Personal life In 1863, he married Sarah Vogel (born 1852 in Chicago), who was also Jewish. They had five children: diplomat Ira Nelson Morris; Edward Morris (married to Helen Swift, daughter of Gustavus Swift, and father of Muriel Gardiner and Ruth Morris Bakwin); Herbert Morris (who died suddenly in 1898); Augusta Morris Rothschild (married to retailer Abram M. Rothschild); and Maude Morris Schwab (married to Henry C. Schwab). He died on August 27, 1907. His wife was killed on September 16, 1909 in an automobile accident at Fontainbleau, France.

American Humanist Association, No. 17-1717, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the separation of church and state related to maintaining the Peace Cross, a World War I memorial shaped after a Latin cross, on government-owned land, though initially built in 1925 with private funds on private lands. The case was a consolidation of two petitions to the court, that of The American Legion who built the cross (Docket 17-1717), and of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission who own the land and maintain the memorial (Docket 18-18). Both petitions challenged the Fourth Circuit's ruling that, regardless of the secular purpose the cross was built for in honoring the deceased soldiers, the cross emboldened a religious symbol and had ordered it altered or razed. The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit's ruling in a 7‚Äì2 decision, determining that since the Cross had stood for decades without controversy, it did not violate the Establishment Clause and could remain standing.Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass'n, . Background The Peace Cross The -tall Peace Cross (officially, the Bladensburg World War I Memorial) was constructed in Bladensburg, Maryland by the American Legion with private funding in 1925 to honor the local servicemen that died during World War I. The creators opted for the cross shape to mirror the gravemarkers that were left in the war theaters to commemorate the dead buried there. At the time it was built, the monument was on private land, but the land was donated in 1961 to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a bi-county agency in Maryland, making it parkland owned by the state. The Commission continued to maintain the Cross even as additional highways were laid down across the land; the Cross eventually became a structure on the median of a highway, creating a potential safety hazard. The Commission provided illumination for the monument at night, and allowed the Cross to be used as a central point for Memorial Day and Veterans Day observances. Additional war memorials were built on nearby lands, creating the local Veterans Memorial Park. Around 2012, local residents recognized that the placement of the Cross on state lands and the Commission's continued care for it with taxpayer funds may be against the principle of the separation of church and state. A formal lawsuit was filed by the American Humanist Association, an atheist advocacy group, that argued that the Peace Cross violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. The case was heard by Judge Deborah Chasanow of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which granted summary judgement for the Commission. Chasanow wrote that under the tests established in Lemon v. Kurtzman and Van Orden v. Perry, that the purpose of the Peace Cross was secular to honor fallen soldiers and did not violate the Establishment Clause. The American Humanist Association appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In October 2017, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court, with Judge Stephanie Thacker's opinion joined by Judge James A. Wynn Jr... Chief Judge Roger Gregory dissented. The majority found that despite the Commission's argument on the monument's secular nature, the symbol of the cross had been considered a religious icon for centuries, and thus they considered that its installation and maintenance on public lands violated the Establishment Clause. Further, the majority held that the Commission's continued maintenance of the memorial contributed to entangling the state with a religious figure, further violating the Establishment Clause, even though the Commissions argued this was for purposes of motorist safety. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the Commission's maintenance of the Peace Cross has \\"a primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government and religion\\". In March 2018, the full circuit denied petitions for rehearing en banc by a vote of 8‚Äì6, with Wynn authoring a concurrence. Gregory who dissented again, feared that the ruling could affect thousands of cross-shaped memorials on public lands even though they were built under similar secular purposes as the Peace Cross. With the refusal, the Fourth Circuit subsequently ordered the Peace Cross to be altered so that it no longer resembled a cross, or to be razed. Judges Paul V. Niemeyer and J. Harvie Wilkinson III also wrote dissents. Supreme Court Both the Planning Commission and the American Legion petitioned for writs of certiorari from the Supreme Court, asking it to review the Fourth Circuit's decision. Both petitions were granted and consolidated to a single case. Questions asked included whether a memorial having the shape of a cross placed on public lands should be considered a violation of the Establishment Clause, or under what past tests they should be considered, and whether maintaining such memorials for other interests of the state, such as road safety, creates entanglement under the Establishment Clause. Among those supporting the Commission and American Legion included numerous veterans groups, the Trump Administration, and several Congresspersons. The Court accepted the case in November 2018. The issue of cross-shaped memorials on public lands had been previously heard in Salazar v. Buono in 2010; while the 5‚Äì4 majority ruled that the cross could stay, the rationale was heavily divided by the justices, with a total of six different opinions submitted as part of the case. This had made it difficult to use Salazar as case law for other related cases, such as this one. On February 27, 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments, including appearances from Neal Katyal for the state petitioner and acting Solicitor General Jeffery Wall for the Federal Government as a friend of the petitioners. Observers to the court believed the justices were in majority to support reversing the Fourth Circuit, believing that the memorial as built had secular purposes reflecting the way soldiers were memorialized at the time. However, how to qualify this under past case law was left as a question, and that if new memorials carrying the cross shape were installed today, they may not be acceptable under the Establishment Clause. Opinion of the Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority and for the plurality On June 20, 2019, the Supreme Court announced judgment in favor of the American Legion, reversing the lower court by a vote of 7‚Äì2. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and partially by Justice Elena Kagan, wrote for the Court and, in some sections, for a mere plurality. The Court declared that it generally does not apply the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman to longstanding monuments for four reasons.. First, the passage of time makes it difficult to identify a monument's original purpose. Second, multiple overlapping purposes may emerge as time goes by. Third, the primary effect of a monument may change as it becomes embedded in a community's sense of place. And fourth, court ordered removal of a longstanding monument may create the appearance of a government ‚Äúaggressively hostile to religion.‚Äù Applying these principles, the Court held that the humanists could not overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality the passage of time had given to the Peace Cross. Historically, the Court found that the World War I context contributed ‚Äúadded secular meaning‚Äù to the cross; quoting as support In Flanders Fields' poetic allusion to rows of crosses,American Legion v. American Humanist Association, 139 S. Ct. 2067, 2076 citing and noting that the Army Distinguished Service Cross and Navy Cross were both established in the immediate aftermath of the war.Am. Legion, 139 S. Ct. at 2076 citing Furthermore, the Court recognized that many of the bereaved local parents would never be able to visit the foreign gravesites of their war dead sons. Overlapping purposes for the cross, thus, evolved through time as first a place of grieving, then of remembrance, and, now, as a busy intersection. Likewise, the Court credited the planning commission's argument that the modern effects of the cross include historic preservation and improved traffic safety. Finally, the Court found that ordering destruction of the cross would not be perceived as a religiously neutral act and viewed the Fourth Circuit's suggested remedy of \\"amputating the arms of the Cross\\" as \\"profoundly disrespectful.\\" Alito stated that \\"The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent\\", and that \\"destroying or defacing the Cross that has stood undisturbed for nearly a century would not be neutral and would not further the ideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment\\". Plurality sections Justice Alito continued, in a four justice plurality opinion that Justice Kagan did not join, to expressly disapprove of Lemon for, he argued, its failed attempt to create a \\"grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause\\". Alito went on to praise the Court's \\"more modest approach\\" in earlier legislative prayer cases, such as Town of Greece v. Galloway (2014). Concurrences Justice Breyer, joined by Kagan, concurred. Breyer quoted his earlier opinion in Van Orden v. Perry (2005) to explain where here, again, a longstanding monument does not pose a real threat to secular tolerance. Breyer, however, rejected arguments advanced by Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch that history and tradition create license to erect new monuments in the old style. Justice Kavanaugh also concurred. Kavanaugh praised the Court for rejecting the Lemon test as it should, he argued, in all cases. Instead, Kavanaugh posited that any government practice rooted in history and tradition that is not coercive should not violate the Establishment Clause. Justice Kagan concurred in part. Kagan agreed that the Lemon test is not always useful, but she rejected the plurality's general disapproval of that precedent. Likewise, in \\"perhaps an abundance of caution\\" Kagen did not join in the plurality's reliance upon history, instead arguing that cases are best decided case-by-case. =Concurrence in the judgment= Thomas and Gorsuch voted for the majority's judgment but did not join Alito's opinion. Thomas, alone, asserted that the Establishment Clause has not been incorporated and so does not apply to the states. Regardless, Thomas believed that sectarian religious displays on public property do not violate the clause anyway. Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, argued the humanists had no standing to sue under the Case or Controversy Clause because they are merely an ‚Äúoffended observer‚Äù. Regardless, Gorsuch praised the plurality for rejecting the Lemon test. Dissent Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Ginsburg read aloud her dissent on the bench at the opinion announcement. According to Ginsburg, all crosses displayed on public property are a presumptively unconstitutional endorsements of Christianity. This presumption may be overcome in some contexts, she offered, such as in a museum display or in a history class. Ginsburg argued that crosses remained unconstitutional in the World War I context by noting that the mass-produced Spirit of the American Doughboy statue was far more common and that the National Jewish Welfare Board had successfully objected to the inclusion of a cross on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.Am. Legion, 139 S. Ct. at 2111 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) citing In Ginsburg's view, the Peace Cross unconstitutionally ‚Äúelevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over non religion.‚Äù Although the dissent refers to the Latin cross as exclusively Christian, the majority opinion notes that the Swiss flag consists of a white cross on a red background.

It is produced by Cave Bear and Tiger Aspect Productions for digital channel BBC Three and is written by Guz Khan and Andy Milligan. Plot Man Like Mobeen follows the life of the titular Mobeen as he spends time with his friends Nate and Eight and, in the absence of their parents, raises his much younger sister, Aqsa, in Small Heath, Birmingham. Mobeen tries to live a good life as a Muslim and ensure his sister reaches her potential while escaping his murky past as a drug dealer. Cast and characters * Guz Khan as Mobeen: A reformed former drug dealer raising his younger sister and trying to improve his community. * Tolu Ogunmefun as Nate: Mobeen's best friend and advocate. * Tez Ilyas as Eight: Mobeen and Nate's close friend, part of the chosen family to Aqsa. * D√∫aa Karim as Aqsa: Younger sister to Mobeen, often exasperated with him but loves and looks up to him. * Perry Fitzpatrick as Officer Harper: The strict but ultimately fair police officer who helps and is helped by Mobeen. Background and production While working as a humanities teacher in a secondary school in Coventry, Guz Khan began making YouTube videos in character as Mobeen, an opinionated care worker who is raising his sister Aqsa. One video reacted to Fox News's suggestion that Birmingham was a no-go area for non-Muslims while another went viral after calling for a boycott of Jurassic World due to its use of the word \\"Pachy\\" to refer to the dinosaur Pachycephalosaurus, as it sounds like the racial slur for people of Pakistani descent, \\"Paki\\". Steve Coogan's production company Baby Cow picked up on Khan's YouTube videos and made a pilot for BBC Three's new talent show, Comedy Feeds. Khan has described the pilot as \\"very generic, super-sitcomy\\" and stated that he wanted to make \\"something more substantial\\" with Man Like Mobeen. The four part first series, produced by Cave Bear and Tiger Aspect Productions, was announced by BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival and was released on iPlayer in December of the same year. The show was picked up for a second series of four episodes in September 2018. During filming for the second series' first episode, which deals with knife crime, Khan and other members of the production called an ambulance after seeing a young boy attacked and threatened with a knife. Khan has stated that while waiting for the ambulance he felt that \\"nothing was more real than the very subject we were filming and talking about\\". In response to the success of the programme with younger audiences, the BBC announced in March 2019 that a third series of Man Like Mobeen had been commissioned. Scripts for Man Like Mobeen were written by Khan and Andy Milligan, creator of the comedy drama Undercover and script writer for TV presenters Ant & Dec. Khan has stated that he wanted the show to portray \\"the funny yet complex realities of life for young working class men and women in Britain today\\", alongside an authentic account of Birmingham, which he feels \\"gets almost no positive representation in the media\\".

She also had a substantial collection of pre-Columbian artifacts and indigenous art pieces. She worked closely with the artist Wolfgang Paalen and other surrealist emigres in Mexico during the early 1940s. Photographs Many of her photographs were published in the DYN surrealist journal written and published by Wolfgang Paalen. Sulzer's intimate images and subtle focuses on feminine icons in pre-Columbian art ring a strong feminist undertone to her images and set her aside from her male contemporaries in Paris and New York. While mainly referred to in context of Paalen, Sulzer was an artist in her own right and continued to live and work in Mexico as a photographer and filmmaker until her death in 1990. As well as contributing to the artistic sensibilities of the Dyn surrealist circle, Sulzer also implemented archeological and anthropological aspects to her and her colleagues writings and works. Sulzer also contributed from her collection of pre-Columbian art to Miguel Covarrubias popular anthologies about Mexican anthropology. In 2012 an array of Sulzers photographs were displayed in an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúFarewell to surrealism: The Dyn circle in Mexico‚Äù as an homage to the Dyn circle journals debut publication; Bringing to light a seemingly under researched and unknown female artist of the 20th century. Much more research is still to be done on Sulzer as a singular entity working in the art world and mediums of photography, film, and music.  Wolfgang Paalen and Eva Sulzer  Paalen and Sulzer met at a Baltic resort in 1931, Sulzer then decided to return to Paris with Paalen and remained close for the remainder of Paalens life Although Paalen was married to the artist Alice Rahon, it has been stated that Rahon, Paalen, and Sulzer were involved in a polyamorous triad, which is highly representative of the open minded sensibilities of the Dyn circle.

Life He was born in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies and studied at the University of Leiden before the outbreak of war. Eight weeks after the Germans occupied the Netherlands in 1940 he and Karel Michielsen (a rower at KSRV Njord, a swimming association at the University) decided to escape to the United Kingdom. Van Eendenburg had a 12-foot motorless gig, named De Beb√®k (the duck), which they brought from the Kaag to the beach near his home in Oegstgeest using a horse and cart. Friends living on the boulevard stored water and life-jackets ready for the voyage and just before the crossing they were joined by a third man Fred Vas Nunes. The first major obstacle would be the surf but the escapees had practiced getting through it in swimming trunks in full sight of the Germans. The date for the escape was set as 5 July 1940. The weather was bad on that day but news came through that there were no other ships on the beach and so the three men stuck to the date. Boats were banned on the beach, but they informed the Germans that they were taking the gig to Scheveningen and were allowed to sail it away. By the time the Germans noticed that the gig was not heading for Scheveningen, it was out of range of their guns. Two days later it reached the British coast, the first Dutch party to do so successfully. The three men were received at Roehampton Park by Queen Wilhelmina, who awarded them all the Bronze Cross without consulting the Dutch government in exile. Radio Oranje also announced that \\"the duck has arrived\\", a coded reference to the successful crossing. Van Eendenburg joined No. 322 (Dutch) Squadron RAF. On 1 September 1944 Squadron Leader K C Kuhlmann, Flight Commander Jan Leendert Plesman (1919-1944) and Van Eendenburg took off on an armed reconnaissance flight. After attacking several ground targets, Kuhlmann was shot down (probably by anti-aircraft fire) and captured. Plesman was shot down and killed. Van Eendenburg's plane was heavily damaged near Lille, though he managed to crash land and escape the Germans. On 11 September he rejoined his squadron and the following day he replaced Kuhlmann as Squadron Leader. He left the air force soon after the end of the war.

Route  Concorde (Esplanade des Invalides) Underpass at Eiffel Tower (Pont d'I√©na) Station de la Tour Eiffel (Pont d'I√©na) Station du Palais des Machines (Avenue de Suffren) The site of the 1889 Exposition Universelle was too large to be explored on foot only. Therefore, an internal railway was built to connect the exhibition buildings on the Esplanade des Invalides with those under the Eiffel Tower. The more than long railway line began from the Concorde Bridge at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs near the Seine. It crossed the Esplanade des Invalides and followed the Quai d'Orsay on the banks of the Seine, within the fence of the Universal Exhibition, between the two rows of trees furthest away from the river. It crossed the Boulevard de la Tour-Maubourg at a level railroad crossing, ran through a 106-meter tunnel underneath Avenue Rapp and Avenue Bosquet, crossed the Avenue de la Bourdonnais and ran then through a deep cut past the Eiffel Tower, made then a perpendicular turn left onto Avenue de Suffren and followed it to the final stop at the Galerie des Machines. In addition to the two termini, there were three stops at the Quai d'Orsay: the first at the Malar intersection, the second opposite the Palais des Produits Alimentaires, the third at the corner of Quai d'Orsay and Avenue de Suffren. The infrastructure and rolling stock were supplied by the Decauville company. The line was double-tracked with a distance of two meters between the opposing tracks. The station buildings at the stops were visible from afar sights to attract the passengers. The son of one of the concessionaires, Louis Gaillot, a young architect, gave them shapes of unusual originality and functionality. The awnings, which covered the platforms, protected the passengers from the weather. At the final stations, the passengers could meet and rest at buffets.  Construction  The track was designed by Monsieur Alphand, the general manager of the works, who commissioned Antoine Gaillot and Paul Gallotti of Gaillot et Cie to build the track under the supervision of Monsieur Lion, the exhibition's engineer. The works were led by the Deputy Chief Engineer J. Charton, who was responsible for the metalworking and dealt in particular with the construction of the railway on the Champ de Mars.  Operation  Some specifications regulated the operation of this railway line by the concessionaire. The trains had to leave every ten minutes from 9 am to midnight from the terminus stations, i.e. six trains per hour or 54 trains per day in each direction. Although the route was completely fenced-off to the public over most of its length, a low top speed of was set. This maximum speed should even be reduced to at certain points along the route, especially at level crossings, where each train was preceded by a flagman. The length of the trains should not exceed , and all trains were equipped with a fast-acting brake. The transport price was uniformly set at 0.25 Francs per person and 0.50 Francs for a seat in the saloon car, regardless of the length of the journey. The passengers were able to buy their tickets in advance at many places. It was sufficient to submit the tickets to the railway staff to get in the car. At the exit they were deposited at the turnstiles. It was claimed that the railway carried 6,342,446 visitors in just six months of operation. For safety, there was a remote- controlled semaphore disc signal at each stop, which could only clear, when the barrier was closed. All trains were announced by a system of electric bells that led from the level crossings to the nearest station. Finally, there was a telephone service in each station.

One of the most interesting came from the artillery captain P√©chot. This Fairlie locomotive and was specially designed for being used by the army. There were also Mallet locomotives that were used under the same conditions as the previous ones. The cars, which were used for passenger traffic, were of different designs, which resembled those of the Ministry of the Armed Forces. Approximately 12 steam locomotives and 100 carriages of different types were used. They had names like Australie, Turkestan, Massouah, Kairoruan, Dumbarton and Hanoi after the locations, where Decauville trains were used. Two of them, Massouah and Turkestan, two passenger cars and some pieces of rail track were subsequently sold to the Helsingborg‚ÄìR√•√•‚ÄìRaml√∂sa J√§rnv√§g in Sweden.

The EP was released on October 26, 2018.  Recording and release  The EP was recorded during the summer of 2018 in vocalist Elliott Wan's home. Production on this EP was also done by Wan, combining his indie influences with various genres such as pop punk, hard rock, and synthpop. The album spawned singles \\"Losing You Again\\" and \\"A Dream Away\\", released August 24 and October 4 on the same year respectively.  Critical reception  Critical reception of the EP was positive upon its release. In a positive review for SCMP Young Post, Chris Gillett described the album as \\"[a] promising debut show[ing] us they have the songwriting potential to make it big\\", and gave the album 4 stars out of 5. Gillett describes \\"Colors\\" as \\"instantly reminiscent of many indie rock bands of the mid-2000s. The understated post-punk bass lines, guitar riffs and soft melodic vocals from Elliot Wan feel like Snow Patrol meets The Fray, but with a little more grit, along with some interesting wordplay.\\" Simon Donald Jones from The Underground HK, praised the production of the album, saying that \\"with seemingly limited time and experience, this trio of HK indie rockers have crafted a self-titled EP that really is very, very good,\\" singling out opening track \\"Colors\\" as an example. \\"The beautifully uplifting chorus reminds me of the 00s UK rock band Elliot Minor, who as it happens were incredibly young when they first found popularity and share their name with lead singer Elliot Wan.\\" Adding on, he praises the whispered spoken word middle eight, and compares it with something that American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars would do. Furthermore, Jones comments that \\"Strange Lives seem to know what their sound is and to me there‚Äôs cohesion in their sonic voice. At times you might find their lyrical content immature ‚Äì teenage jealousy and infatuation ‚Äì but these are emotions we can experience at any age. This a band for everybody. Not just teenagers.\\" He concludes that \\"sometimes age and experience don‚Äôt matter when something is good. And Strange Lives are good. It‚Äôs about time Hong Kong produced some world beaters and these guys have just the right tools to maybe be it.\\" NewEars Music described the album's musical style as 'teeming with brit-rock', and praised the group for actively using synthesizers in addition to basic 3-piece instrumentation during the production of the EP.

The three-winged Renaissance Revival style main building is from 1857 and was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1978. History Early history Gundetved is first mentioned in 1339 when it was owned by Mathias Jensen. It was in the 15th century owned by the Limb√¶k family. In 1451, it was thus owned by Otte Limb√¶k. His daughter, the widow of Jon Bille, was the owner in 1489, The ownership of the estate was later ceded to Niels Henriksen as dowry in connection with his marriage to their daughter Margrete Bille. He was later ennobled under the name Arenfeldtand and succeeded J√∏rgen Mrrsvin as Chancellor of the Realm in circa 1526. After Niels Henriksen Arenfeldt's death in 1533, Gundetved was passed to his sons Henrik and Torben Arenfeldt. Henrik Arenfeldt's son Niels Arenfeldt was from circa 1580 the owner of the estate. He is known to have had at least 13 children with four different women. This led to an impeachment for breach of the Sixth Commandment in which he was sentenced to paying a fine to a hospital and secretly make his confessions of penitents. In 1628, Gundetved was acquired by Ernst Normand. He sold the estate to Joachim Normand in 1636. They had both come to Denmark from R√ºgen. In 1645,Gundetved was acquired by Axel Juul of Volstrup who would later also acquire S√¶bygaard and Kattrup. In 1664, he sold all his estates to Treasure Henrik M√ºller. M√ºller's son, Frants M√ºller, sold the estate to Bertel Jensen, who in turn sold it to Axel Nielsen. In 1696, Gundetved was acquired by Brostrup Albertin. Ge was a Supreme Court attorney. In 1710, he sold the estate to Henrik Wigant Michelbecher,. His widow sold it at a very low price to Jacob Benzon in 1720 . In 1820, Benzon sold the estate to Frederik Adeler for just over twice the price that he had paid nine years earlier. The Selchau family, 1782‚Äì1940 Christian Andreas Selchau In 1782, Gundetved was acquired by Christian Andreas Selchau, a son of the owner of Benzonslund at Ringsted, who renamed the estate Selchausdal in 1799. Ob his death in 1816, Selchausdal was owned by his widow until their son Jens Christian Selchau took over in 1821. The new main building seen on a drawing by Ferdinand Richardt Jens Christian Selchau died in 1920. His widow, Annette Christiane von Herbst, ceded the to their son Christian Andreas Selchau when she remarried in 1842. Christian Andreas Selchau commissioned Johan Daniel Herholdt to design a new main building which was completed in 1857. Christian Andreas Selchau died unmarried in 1893. Selchausdal was then passed to his sister, Michelle Christiane Selchau. She converted the property into a home for 12 elderly women. After her early death, Selchausdal passed to her cousin, Gundo S. Vogt. Later owners, 1940‚Äìpresent In 1940, Selchausdal wqs acquired by Consul General H. O. Lange. He left the estate to a foundation. Architecture The two-storey main building is designed with inspiration from Renaissance architecture. The building is constructed in red brick with horizontal bands and other details in cement. The north-facing principal facade features a central tower topped by an onion dome while the two outer bays at each end are topped by tall gables. Two short side wings project from the rear side of the building. The building was refurbished in 1940-41 under supervision of A. Maar. The original open porte-coch√®re was at this event converted into a closed structure. Today The main building is now operated as a venue for meetings and other events. Selchausdal is a member of Small Danish Hotels.

Chillon's third short film was shown at well over 300 film festivals between 2015 and the end of 2019, and has won approximately sixty awards and honours, including Best Short Film from the 2015 Sitges Film Festival, the most important fantastic film festival in Spain. In 2017, They Will All Die in Space received a general theatrical release through its inclusion in the Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film, Galaxy of Horrors. Plot Phil Eberhart (Ben Temple) and Dan Atenas () are crew members of the starship Tantalus. Dan removes Alexander Talabot (Julio Perill√°n) from one of dozens of cryogenic chambers aboard the ship. Phil explains to Alexander that they have reanimated him because an asteroid shower nearly destroyed the Tantalus four months after departure; the crew has been adrift for six months without any form of communication and having lost its main engine. Alexander suggests that they reanimate his wife, who has the technical skills to help the men out of their predicament, but Eberhart tells him that the ship is doomed to drift through space until supplies run out, and asks Alexander if that is the fate to which he wants to subject his wife. As Alexander works on repairs, he grows more suspicious about Phil and Dan. Cast * as Dan Atenas *Julio Perill√°n as Alex Talabot *Ben Temple as Phil Eberhart Themes, genre, and influences After directing two other short films involving returning astronauts (one of which a chimpanzee), the mockumentary Die Schneider Krankheit (2008) and Decapoda Shock (2011), Javier Chillon wanted to do something a bit more conventional, a film that was \\"straight up science fiction\\" with no supernatural elements, something closer to a detective story: he had always liked the idea of a starship stranded in space, and one day the story just came to him. While classic science fiction films like Alien and Outland were major inspirations, Chillon was mainly influenced by what helped inspire those films in the first place: \\"the whole French new wave of science fiction comic books in the 60s and 70s,\\" such as M√©tal hurlant, Val√©rian, and artists such as Moebius, Enki Bilal, Juan Gim√©nez, and Frederik Peeters. Production Development and support Chillon worked on the film for four years (from script writing to filming was three years), keeping costs down by borrowing space and equipment from his associate producers: a sound stage belonging to Behind the Movies, and a RED camera from Morituri. Design, effects, and filming The biggest part of the project was the sets, which Chillon and his crew built \\"from scratch\\" with a view to minimising the need for CGI, but also for aesthetic reasons related to his influences. Most of the visual effects are old-fashioned models made with the help of Jos√© Luis Orive (called \\"Rambo\\") to create different spaces on the ship; the relatively little CGI was done by User T38, integrating, creating the astronaut in 3D, the spacecraft, and so on. Julio Perill√°n Chillon said the three actors, , Julio Perill√°n and Ben Temple, understood their roles and the tone of the story perfectly. Chillon and his director of photography, Luis Fuentes, thought of the film as something of a mixture of science fiction and thriller, and decided to shoot the film in black and white to inject a sense of noir into the story. Release They Will All Die in Space had its premiere at the 35th Fantafestival in Rome on 25 June 2015. In less than two years, the short had been selected for nearly 300 film festivals worldwide, where it received much praise. By March 2019, the short had been shown at 336 festivals. Anthology film They Will All Die in Space is included in the 2017 Canadian science-fiction horror anthology film Galaxy of Horrors, which comprises eight shorts within a larger narrative frame in which a man awakens from a cryogenic sleep pod and is forced to watch the shorts as entertainment while his damaged life-support runs out. The anthology film had its premiere in Toronto at Imagine Cinemas Carlton on 1 March 2017. the feature was conceived by Little Terrors short films festival founder Justin McConnell, who directed the narrative frame, and Indiecan Entertainment's Avi Federgreen. The production is the second collaboration between Rue Morgue Cinema and Little Terrors, following Minutes Past Midnight. Home media and streaming The film is available to view on Vimeo in its entirety, and is a Vimeo Staff Pick. The Galaxy of Horrors anthology was released on DVD and special edition Blu-ray in 2017. The anthology was made available through various video on demand options on the IndieCan Entertainment website, on 7 March 2017, and on Amazon Prime. Reception Critical response They Will All Die in Space made Shawn Herbert's top ten list of \\"life changing short films\\" in 2018, saying it was \\"an interesting watch, especially for those who enjoy having goosebumps!\\" Peter Martin called the film an \\"extremely well-crafted film\\", while Terek Puckett said \\"Chillon delivers a great piece of space horror with a grim tone reminiscent of many American science fiction feature films of the early 1970s.\\" Richard Sopko concurred, and averred: \\"It's well acted so there's an immediate engagement with the characters.\\" Carl Fisher compared the claustrophobic feel to Alien and considered the film the best of the eight in the Canadian anthology. Jeff Spry, writing for Syfy Wire, called it \\"an exceptional example of the short film form, filled with fluid camerawork\\", actors who are \\"invested in the material,\\" brooding music, and \\"an unappetizing twist on a familiar trope in outer-space movies\\"; a film \\"gorgeous to watch, even when the horrifying mystery unfolds\\". Andrew Liptak said it channels the claustrophobic tension of Alien and the desperate situation of Passengers, and \\"ends with a neat twist that pays off exceptionally well.\\" Cheryl Eddy of io9 enjoyed the \\"crisp black-and-white\\" and \\"sinister new spin\\" on the otherwise familiar story of a space ship filled with humans slumbering in cryogenic chambers encounters catastrophic troubles in deep space. Joseph Perry praised all elements of the film: > Chillon's script runs lean and mean, building toward an exciting payoff. The > three actors turn in splendid performances. Art direction/production design > head Idoia Esteban and her visual effects crew have created a stunning world > of, in, and outside of the spaceship, including a marvelously rendered > design of the Tantalus by Stephane Chasseloup. Set dressers Victor Lopez and > Alvaro Suarez, along with the rest of the short's art department, have done > a first-rate job building impressive set designs for the ship's interior. > Luis Fuentes's cinematography is striking, and the choice of filming in > black-and-white fits the somber tone of the proceedings perfectly. A > fittingly eerie synthesizer score by Cirilo Fernandez works in tandem with > Roberto Fernandez's sound design. Alisha Bunting praises the cinematography, sound design, and the acting, which \\"matched the film\\", wishing there had been a bit more shown of the two waking crew interacting while the protagonist is in cryogenesis, and hoped the short would be converted into a feature.

She also exchanged letters with philosopher Eric Voegelin, both of them having been Rockefeller Foundation fellows at Columbia University. After marrying Hendrik de Waal in 1939, she lived in Paris and Switzerland before settling down in Tunbridge Wells. Writing de Waal wrote five novels in her lifetime, \\"two in German and three in English.\\" The only one published was The Exiles Return which was released posthumously when her grandson, the artist and writer Edmund de Waal, brought it to the attention of publishers. The novel follows three Austrian exiles returning to Austria in 1954. A New York Times review by Andrew Ervin wrote, \\"De Waal brings these characters together in a tightly wound story of love, betrayal and class tension among Austria's aristocratic, clerical and intellectual spheres. If the plot can seem a bit like a PBS costume drama waiting to happen, so does de Waal's personal history.\\" Edmund de Waal introduced the novel at the Austrian Cultural Institute in London. He observed that it \\"was not a melancholic occasion. It was a powerful affirmation of how stories can survive and find audiences.\\" Persephone Books released an issue of The Exiles Return which donates proceeds to the Refugee Center with every copy.

Silver-Greenberg was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for a series of New York Times articles that revealed how corporations use binding arbitration to prevent American consumers from suing for relief in the judicial system. She was also a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for her 2011 series in The Wall Street Journal revealing the increasingly exploitative tactics of debt collectors. Additional recognition includes the New York Press Club Award for consumer reporting and the Newswomen's Club of New York Award for Best Bylined Front Page Story. Silver-Greenberg has reported for The New York Times since March 2012. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.  Early life and career  Silver-Greenberg was born in New York City but grew up in Los Angeles. An early influence was her grandmother, ‚Äúwho never forgot a birthday and taught her how to be a sleuth.‚Äù In 2004, Silver-Greenberg earned her bachelor's degree in English literature and American studies from Princeton University. After a stint as an investigator in the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, Silver-Greenberg began her journalism career in 2007 as a consumer finance reporter for BusinessWeek. She then worked as a projects and investigations reporter at Bloomberg between in 2010 before serving as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Money & Investing section from July 2010 to March 2012. She joined The New York Times in March 2012.  2012: Wall Street Journal investigation of debt collectors  In 2012, Silver-Greenberg was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for her Wall Street Journal investigation on the U.S. debt collection industry. The Pulitzer citation highlights ‚Äúher compelling examination of aggressive debt collectors whose often questionable tactics, profitable but largely unseen by the public, vexed borrowers hard hit by the nation's financial crisis.‚Äù Her March 17, 2011 article, ‚ÄúWelcome to Debtors‚Äô Prison, 2011 Edition,‚Äù revealed that the debt collectors increasingly sought in the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis to have borrowers who couldn‚Äôt pay arrested and put in jail, often as a result of ‚Äúsloppy, incomplete or even false documentation that can result in borrowers having no idea before being locked up that they were sued to collect an outstanding debt.‚Äù Other articles in the series reported on the record number of complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 against the debt collection industry and the aggressive tactics used by ‚Äúdeath debt collectors‚Äù to collect money from family members of the deceased. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown cited one of Silver-Greenberg's articles on the use of credit card offers to secure payment on already-expired debts in a letter calling on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ban the practice.  2016: New York Times investigation of forced arbitration  After moving to The New York Times in 2012, Silver- Greenberg became a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for her reporting, along with New York Times reporters Michael Corkery and Robert Gebeloff, on the growing pattern of companies and banks using obscure clauses in contracts to require consumers to resolve disputes through private arbitration, effectively preventing consumers from using the judicial system to do so. Six articles in this series between November 1 and November 21, 2015 were nominated. ‚ÄúBy inserting individual arbitration clauses into a soaring number of consumer and employment contracts,‚Äù Silver and her fellow New York Times reporters explained, ‚Äúcompanies like American Express devised a way to circumvent the courts and bar people from joining together in class-action lawsuits, realistically the only tool citizens have to fight illegal or deceitful business practices.‚Äù The reporters combed through thousands of federal court records between 2010 and 2014 and conducted interviews with people involved in those cases to produce the series. The series had an immediate impact. In Washington, U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy and Al Franken, joined by 14 others, wrote a letter to President Obama the month the series was published highlighting the New York Times reporting and calling for more action on forced arbitration. Leahy and Franken introduced a bill the following year seeking to impose new restrictions on arbitration. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Hank Johnson said the ‚Äúexhaustive and thoughtful series by The New York Times cataloguing the immense harms of forced arbitration should shake Congress into action.‚Äù Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited the first article of the series in her dissent in the case Directv, inc. v Imburgia et al. A backlash from supporters of arbitration also followed the publication. Theodore J. St. Antoine, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Law School and former president of the National Academy of Arbitrators, wrote in a letter to the editor in The New York Times that private arbitration is ‚Äúcheaper, faster, at least as fair and far more accessible to the average consumer or employee than a costly, complicated court action‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe ban on class actions is the true villain.‚Äù Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Action Network purchased attack ads against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which sought to restrict arbitration, and lobbied in Congress to restrict the CFPB's powers. The forced arbitration series continued to receive attention in Washington well after its initial publication. In 2017, during the Senate confirmation hearing of Neil Gorsuch as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Senator Al Franken asked Gorsuch directly if he had read the New York Times investigation and pressed Gorsuch regarding his stance on forced arbitration.

Early life and education Chalker was born in Mobile, Alabama and entered the United States Coast Guard Academy, from which he graduated, in 1903. Career During his early Coast Guard career, Chalker served on three Bering Sea ice patrols. In World War I he was posted to the Columbia-class protected cruiser USS Minneapolis and, following the war, was navigator of USS Von Steuben and commanding officer of the destroyer USS Ericsson. He later went on to command Coast Guard Destroyer Division One and the Coast Guard Destroyer Force. From 1931 to 1934 Chalker was chief of personnel of the Coast Guard. On March 27, 1935 Chalker ‚Äì then a commander ‚Äì was given charge of Coast Guard Air Station Dinner Key. Four months later he was made head of Coast Guard Aviation. In 1939 Chalker represented the Coast Guard at an intra-government conference held in the office of General Hap Arnold which was charged with setting performance standards for the U.S. government's future acquisition of helicopters; other agencies involved in the conference included the United States Army, United States Navy, United States Department of Agriculture, and the United States Department of the Interior. During World War II Chalker served as Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard. During this time he resisted the acquisition of helicopters by the Coast Guard, a position supported by the Coast Guard's Engineer-in-Chief Rear Admiral Harvey Johnson, due to the expense of the aircraft and the limited utility of nascent helicopters in the prosecution of the war effort versus their significant cost. In 1942 he was principal speaker at the Miami Navy Day celebrations held at the Miami Orange Bowl. He retired in 1946 and was advanced to the rank of vice admiral. In the year of his retirement he was invested into the Legion of Merit. Chalker has been credited as the \\"father of Coast Guard aviation\\". Personal life Chalker married Aline Brooks Risque with whom he had one daughter. During retirement he moved from his longtime home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, to San Diego, California, to be closer to his daughter. He lived in San Diego until his death. He was interred at the Arlington National Cemetery on March 17, 1981.

Anderson is an American sociologist and entrepreneur. He is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Raheem.ai, a chatbot which helps the public monitor police interactions. He was the 2018 Echoing Green Black Male Achievement Fellow and is a 2019 TED fellow.  Early life  Anderson was born in Oklahoma. His mother is a rental car clerk and his father a forklift truck driver. He has described his childhood as being \\"characterised by violence\\". He was kicked out of his grandparents house as a teenager and made homeless. Anderson ran away with his best friend, with whom he later fell in love. Anderson enlisted in the Army in 2003, where he worked as a satellite engineer. In 2007, while Anderson was serving as an engineer in the army overseas, his partner was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop.  Education and career  Anderson became a community activist and organiser, earning a degree at Georgetown University in 2015. At Georgetown he studied sociology and philosophy. He served as a Racial Equity Fellow at the Washington, D.C. Center for the Study of Social Policy. Anderson learned that the majority of people don't report negative interactions with police officers because they \\"do not trust the system\\". In 2014 Anderson was awarded money from Fast ForWord and the My Brother's Keeper Challenge to build Raheem.ai, a Facebook messenger chatbot that eliminates barriers to reporting police misconduct. The chatbot allows the public to evaluate police interactions and offers follow-on support for users. Raheem.ai was inspired by Waze, who, alongside offering navigation information, use user-generated information to inform local government about fill potholes. The chatbot asks questions about recent interactions with the police, anonymises the data that is collected and shares them in real-time to a public dashboard on police performance. Raheem.ai publishes reports about where police are working well and where they are failing communities. It aims to reach all fifty states by 2020. With Raheem.ai Anderson looks to build the first crowdsourced database of police interactions. In 2016 Anderson delivered a TED talk at Georgetown, where he discussed what it means to be vulnerable. He was named as one of the National Black Justice Coalition 100 Black LGBTQ/SGL Emerging Leaders. Anderson was made an Echoing Green Fellow in 2018.

Themes * Targeting pro-Palestinian politicians: Shai Masot, an official at the embassy, was recorded as seeking in a conversation with a British civil servant to ‚Äútake down‚Äù British politicians, including Alan Duncan, then Minister of State for Europe and the Americas. Crispin Blunt, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, was said to be on a ‚Äúhitlist‚Äù. * Supporting lobbying groups: Masot was also recorded as seeking to promote the establishment of a pro-Israel youth organisation, intended to be linked to the existing Labour Friends of Israel. He was also recorded as telling Joan Ryan, Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, that he had ¬£1 million to fund trips to Israel. * Allegations of antisemitism: Joan Ryan was shown arguing with Labour Party member and pro-Palestine activist Jean Fitzpatrick about a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestine at the 2016 Labour Party Conference. Ryan lodged a formal complaint of antisemitic behaviour as a result of this conversation. Her account of the incident was disputed and her complaint was later dismissed. Fitzpatrick told al Jazeera that \\"If you do talk about Palestine, it would appear you're kind of sucked into having an accusation of anti-Semitism brought against you\\". The film also included an interview with Jackie Walker, who was accused of antisemitism in relation to remarks she made at the conference. Walker told al Jazeera that \\"I would say there is a crisis in the way the anti-Semitism is being manipulated and being used by certain parts ‚Äì not just in the Labour Party but other parties and the media to discredit Jeremy Corbyn and a number of his supporters\\". Consequences and responses The Israeli ambassador, Mark Regev apologized to Alan Duncan for the comments made by Masot. Masot was sent back to Israel and resigned, as did the civil servant involved. The Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, called on the Commons foreign affairs committee to conduct an inquiry into what appeared to be improper interference in British politics by a foreign power. The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote to the Prime Minister along the same lines. Alex Salmond, the Scottish National Party‚Äôs foreign affairs spokesman, asked for a full investigation, while Crispin Blunt questioned whether Israel's interests were best served by such methods. However, Boris Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, rejected calls to take action against the Israeli embassy and said that he regarded the matter as closed. The National Union of Students said it was investigating alleged attempts to influence last year‚Äôs leadership election, which saw its first black, Muslim, female president Malia Bouattia voted in. Following claims that opposing NUS members held ‚Äúsecret meetings‚Äù with activists supported by the Israeli embassy, a spokesperson for the union said the organisation was looking into the allegations, particularly regarding NUS officers. The Labour Party declined to investigate complaints arising from the programme against Joan Ryan and the Jewish Labour Movement director. The Jewish Chronicle dismissed the film as \\"the stupid bragging of two junior aides with close to zero influence\\". In October 2017, Ofcom rejected complaints that the series was antisemitic or had breached impartiality rules. Second series (The Lobby ‚Äì USA) The US version of the film was leaked by a third party and Al Jazeera issued a statement condemning its release. In the US version an Al Jazeera reporter named James Anthony Kleinfeld had infiltrated several pro-Israel advocacy organizations in Washington, D.C. including Stand With Us, Brandeis Center, The Israel Project, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Israel on Campus Coalition, the Zionist Organization of America's (ZOA) Fuel For Truth, and the Canary Mission. One of the major claims in the film is that Israeli-American real estate investor Adam Milstein, a major donor to pro- Israel campus groups, funds Canary Mission, an anonymous website that names and shames pro-Palestinian activists at North American universities. The evidence for the claim is an exchange between Al-Jazeera's undercover reporter \\"Toby\\" who is posing as an intern and Eric Gallagher, an employee at The Israel Project: In a statement to JTA, a spokesperson for Milstein denied that he funded Canary Mission. The spokesperson also provided an email from Gallagher where he denied having referred to Milstein.  Publication and censorship  On October 11, 2017, Al Jazeera announced that it had installed an undercover journalist inside several Washington‚Äìbased pro-Israel organisations in 2016 and that it was planning to air a documentary film based on the reporter's work. Clayton Swisher, Al Jazeera's director of investigative reporting, also acknowledged that the network had stationed an undercover journalist in both the UK and US at the same time. On February 8, 2018, it was reported that Qatari leaders had reassured the leaders of Jewish American organisations that Al Jazeera would not be airing its companion documentary series on the Israel lobby in the United States. According to Haaretz, the Qatari government had reportedly hired Republican Senator Ted Cruz's former aide Nicolas Muzin to open communications channels with Jewish American organisations. Earlier, the network had sent letters to several American pro-Israel organisations informing them that their employees would appear in the documentary. These letters generated speculation that the Qatari government had reneged on its earlier promise to block Al Jazeera from screening the controversial documentary which, like the earlier British series, had utilized clandestine footage and recordings of pro-Israel activists. Al Jazeera's decision not to screen the documentary drew criticism from Clayton Swisher, who defended the network's investigation unit's use of undercover journalism and accused the network of capitulation to outside pressure. Swisher also took a sabbatical from Al Jazeera to express his disagreement with the network's handling of the situation. In March 2018, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers including Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, and Ted Cruz penned a letter urging United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate whether Al Jazeera should register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They also urged the Justice Department to investigate reports that the network had infiltrated non-profit organisations and accused Al Jazeera of broadcasting antisemitic, anti-Israel, and anti-American content. On April 10, 2018, the Zionist Organization of America's president Morton Klein claimed credit for lobbying the Qatari government not to screen Al Jazeera's companion documentary series focusing on American pro-Israel lobby. In late August and early September 2018, leaked portions of the documentary series were aired by several outlets including The Electronic Intifada. In early November, The Electronic Intifada released the four episodes of The Lobby‚ÄîUSA simultaneously with the French media outlet Orient XXI and the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar.  Reception  Asa Winstanley called it a \\"superb undercover investigation.\\" Ali Abunimah called it a really \\"important film.\\" See also *The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy References External links * The Lobby * The Lobby ‚Äì USA * IMDB - The Lobby * IMDB - the Lobby - USA Category:Al Jazeera Category:Israel‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Category:Documentary films about antisemitism Category:Documentary films about American politics Category:Documentary films about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Category:Documentary films about British politics Category:Films about propaganda Category:Labour Party (UK) Category:Lobbying in the United Kingdom Category:Political advocacy groups in the United Kingdom Category:2010s political films Category:Political television series Category:Zionism in the United Kingdom Category:2010s documentary films ","title":"The Lobby (TV series)"},{"id":"60093150","title":"Evergreen (After the Burial album)"},{"id":"60093153","text":"The Port Authority Police Department is a law enforcement agency in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. It is a transit police agency, authorized by Title 22, Chapter 33 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, which provides policing, investigation and crime prevention services to Port Authority of Allegheny County facilities, routes and services.  History  The first officer attributed to the Port Authority Police Department, Rege Kelly, was appointed in 1968 to investigate security issues and serve as a liaison with other law enforcement agencies. At that time, patrol services were provided by the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office on a contract basis. Kelly, a retired officer of the Pittsburgh Police Department, was subsequently appointed as the first Chief of Police upon the formal formation of the department. In 1985 the Port Authority Police Department reorganized as a police department under Title 22, Chapter 33 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. The Allegheny County Sheriff's Office withdrew all services in 1997, placing full responsibility for transit policing on the PAPD. The then Chief, William T. McArdle, directed the expansion of the department, including creation of a number of specialized units, and prioritized officer education. The merger of the PAPD with the Allegheny County Police Department for cost-saving and oversight purposes has been explored on a number of occasions.  Organization  A PAPD Ford Police Interceptor Utility patrol vehicle.The executive of the Port Authority Police Department is the Chief of Police, currently Matt Porter, and is appointed by the Port Authority of Allegheny County. In addition to regular patrol officers which conduct foot and motor patrol, the department comprises several specialized units. * Bike Unit - The Bike Unit provides patrol, traffic enforcement, crowd control and community relations services and are regularly deployed to Pittsburgh's central business district, Port Authority park and ride lots and pedestrian and bicycle throughways. The unit utilizes mountain bikes, and officers are certified by the International Police Mountain Bike Association. * Emergency Services Unit - The Emergency Services Unit provides tactical, counter-terrorism, protective, hazardous materials and explosives services. Officers also conduct routine patrol duties and operate in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Police Department, Allegheny County Police Department and Pennsylvania State Police to respond to critical incidents both on and off the Port Authority system. * Plain Clothes Unit - The Plain Clothes Unit, also referred to as the detective unit, provides investigative services for crimes which occur on or against Port Authority property. Serious offences, such as sexual assault or homicide, are referred to the Allegheny County Police Department. * Digital Forensics Unit - Formerly the Computer Forensics Unit, the Digital Forensics Unit provides video, audio, and cell phone evidence analysis. This unit regularly assists outside agencies due to its unique specialist nature. * Collision Investigation Unit - The Collision Investigation Unit, also referred to as the traffic or accident unit, investigates serious collisions involving Port Authority vehicles. * Canine Unit - The Canine Unit provides patrol and explosives detection services throughout the Port Authority system.  Vehicles  The PAPD utilizes the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, Chevrolet Suburban and Chevrolet Impala as marked patrol vehicles. It also operates a Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD with a utility body as the primary Emergency Services Unit vehicle. All SUVs are fitted with full-coverage wrap-round push bars for moving disabled vehicles. The department is in transition between an all white paint scheme with a blue stripe and department seal on the front doors, and a more complex blue-and-white LAPD-style color scheme featuring large lettering across both doors and the department badge on the front quarter-panel.

Pendleton earned degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the University of California at Santa Cruz and was hired by NASA as a civil servant in 1979. She served as a research scientist in the Space Science and Astrobiology Division at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) until 2007, including as Division Chief from 2006-7. In 2007 she was promoted to the Senior Executive Service, the highest level of civil service within the Federal government, and throughout her career has served in high-level leadership positions at both NASA's ARC (in California) and Headquarters (in Washington, D.C.). Her scientific research has investigated the origin and evolution of organic material in our galaxy and is currently focused on the composition of the solar nebula from which our Solar System formed. She is an elected fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and Asteroid 7165. Pendleton was named by the International Astronomical Union in honor of her research contributions. Early life Pendleton grew up in Key West, Florida, the youngest of two children born to Willie G. Pendleton and Emilia Claudia Pendleton. Yvonne has wanted to be a part of NASA since she was 10 years old when she could sometimes watch Apollo rockets from her back yard just after they would launch from the Kennedy Space Center.https://lunarscience.nasa.gov/?profile=yvonne-pendleton Her older sister, Olga Pendleton Herman (Ph.D. in Statistics), played an important role in Yvonne's career path, as she served as her role model to stay in school and get her Ph.D. Personal life Pendleton is married to a planetary astronomer, Dale Cruikshank. They married in 1996, joining together a total of five children from previous marriages. Pendleton and Cruikshank merged not only their families, but also their interests in the origin and composition of primitive Solar System objects, and have published research papers together. They are also raising a golden retriever therapy dog, Toby, to go into schools and hospitals. Pendleton has taken Toby, whose American Kennel Club registered name is ‚ÄúCosmic Rover‚Äù, to work with her to complete his socialization training, and he has become the institute's mascot. In her spare time, Yvonne is an avid scuba diver, having earned her open water certification in 1985. Entering the professional dive industry in 2015, she became a divemaster, and then an Assistant Instructor (2018) through the PADI dive association. Since 2015, she has assisted several scuba classes through a local dive shop in northern California. Education Pendleton earned her Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1979. In her senior year at Georgia Tech, NASA Ames Research Center recruited her to work at ARC in California, offering to pay for her continued education while working part- time at ARC, if she could be accepted into a graduate-level engineering program at a local university. She applied to the Aeronautics and Astronautics engineering program at Stanford University, and once accepted, was hired as a civil servant at NASA ARC. While working part-time at ARC, she completed the master's degree program at Stanford University in 1981, after which she returned to full-time employment.https://introductionsnecessary.com/2016/06/22/yvonne-pendleton/ In 1982 she applied for admission to the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and upon acceptance, was awarded another NASA graduate study fellowship which enabled her to complete her PhD, ‚Äú Analysis of Dust Grain Properties in Two Star Forming Regions Through Comparison of Theoretical Models to Observations‚Äù, in 1987. Her thesis advisor at the University of California, Santa Cruz was David Rank, and her advisors at NASA ARC were Michael Werner and Alexander Tielens. Career Pendleton's career path was influenced by the academic environment of the Planetary Systems Branch of the Space Science and Astrobiology Division at NASA's Ames Research Center, especially in the 1980s. The role NASA scientists played in the Voyager and Pioneer missions enabled Pendleton to meet scientists from many universities and other NASA centers when they would come to Ames to give seminars or meet with colleagues. One, in particular, Carl Sagan, had a profound effect on her career, stemming from their meetings in those formative years soon after finishing her Ph.D. He encouraged her, as he did many young people, by taking the time to write her the occasional letter commenting on the importance he saw in a recent paper she had published. On one occasion when he was attending a conference held at Ames, at which she gave a talk, he encouraged her to pursue her investigations into the organic component of the interstellar medium, work that was in the very earliest stages at that time. Many of her colleagues in the Space Science Division were similarly supportive of her work over the next two decades, and her career developed a strong national and international reputation as she continued her observational work at major observatories and published more than 80 scientific papers. From 1994 to 2006, she was the Principal Investigator of high-profile observational programs, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and ground-based observatories around the world. In 2006, she was asked to become Chief of the same division in which her career had started in 1979. Appointed Chief of the Space Science and Astrobiology Division at NASA Ames Research Center in 2006, she led a scientific and technical staff of 160 people. In January 2007, she was selected to become a member of the Senior Executive Service (SES). In March 2007, Pendleton was appointed Senior Advisor for the Research and Analysis programs in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. She and her husband, Dale Cruikshank, moved to Washington, DC, where she provided independent assessments and guidance to the Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate concerning NASA's science research programs (March 2007 through May 2008). During that time, Pendleton and her team increased scientific productivity across the nation as the time required to evaluate and award research grants was significantly reduced. In January 2008, she was given the additional responsibility for oversight of the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) of NASA's Science Mission Directorate and led a team that managed the nearly 50 million dollar investment made in EPO activities, including those from NASA's science missions. At the completion of her detail to NASA Headquarters, Pendleton returned to NASA ARC (June 2008) and was appointed Deputy Associate Director of NASA Ames Research Center. In this position within the Center Director's office, she provided guidance and direction to collaborative scientific and technical efforts and served as the first academic Dean of Students for the several hundred students on the Ames campus each summer.is https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior- executive-service/overview-history/ NASA-Ames Research Center In July 2010, the Ames Research Center Director appointed Pendleton to be the first Director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI), a virtual institute supporting scientists across the nation, managed by a central office at NASA ARC. In 2013, the scope of NASA's human exploration program expanded to focus on near-Earth asteroids, resulting in an expansion of the portfolio the virtual institute covered, to include not only the Moon but also the moons of Mars and the near-Earth asteroids. This required the creation of a new institute, the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) and Pendleton was named its first Director. She served in that capacity for eight years, but in 2018 requested to return to full-time astronomical research as the promise of the James Webb Space Telescope offers such tantalizing opportunities to address the questions in her original line of research. Having won the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Executive in 2017, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2015, and earning the San Jose Business Journal Top 100 Most Influential Women in Silicon Valley award in 2014, Pendleton's success as an executive leader was well established, but so too was her scientific research career. Her request was granted by NASA with the caveat that she remain a part of the institute she had helped to create, as the first Chief Scientist of the institute. In this newly developed role, she provides technical guidance for the institute, while pursuing her independent astronomical research in support of NASA's mission to explore our origins. Publications Pendleton has authored more than 80 publications throughout her career.https://sservi.nasa.gov/?profile=yvonne-pendleton Awards and recognition Pendleton has received numerous awards for her scientific research and her leadership roles at NASA. In addition to becoming the first woman Chief of the Space Science and Astrobiology Division at NASA Ames Research Center, she was also the first Dean of Students at NASA ARC and the first Chief Scientist of the virtual institute that she led as Director for 8 years. The International Astronomical Society named Asteroid 7165 Pendleton after her contributions to the study of organic material in space in 1997. She was elected, in 2003, a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. She was competitively selected for the Federal Government Senior Executive Service in 2007. In 2014, she was named one of the top 100 most influential women in Silicon Valley by the San Jose Business Journal. In 2015, she was awarded one of NASA's highest awards, the Outstanding Leadership Medal. In 2017, she was honored with the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Executive by the federal government. She was also competitively selected for Federal Government Senior Executive Service from 2007 to now.https://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/sservi-director-yvonne-pendleton- receives-presidential-rank-award/.

He also was a member of the Michigan Panthers, Oklahoma Outlaws and Jacksonville Bulls in the United States Football League. He played college football at Central State University. Early years Anderson attended Withrow High School. He accepted a football scholarship from Central State University. He was a three-year starter at defensive end and also played defensive tackle occasionally in a five-man defensive line. He led the team in sacks and tied for the lead in interceptions in his last 3 seasons. As a junior, he had 12 sacks in 10 games. As a senior, he registered 7 sacks in 9 games. In 2011, he was inducted into the Central State University Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career Anderson was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 5th round (128th overall) of the 1979 NFL Draft. He was waived on August 18. On October 9, 1979, he was signed as a free agent by the Kansas City Chiefs to replace an injured Mike Bell. He was released on July 21, 1980. In 1980, he signed with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He was released on June 29, 1981. On November 23, 1982, he was signed by the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League. In 1983, he played only 3 games (2 starts) because of a hand injury, for a team that would become the USFL champion. He was selected by the Oklahoma Outlaws in the first round of the United States Football League expansion draft at the end of the season. In 1984, he led the Outlaws in sacks with 11. At the end of the season, the league consolidated from 18 to 14 teams and Anderson was allocated to the Jacksonville Bulls. In 1985, he had 3 sacks. The league folded in 1986. On July 23, 1986, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He left training camp on August 2. On July 14, 1987, he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals. He was released on August 2. After the NFLPA strike was declared on the third week of the season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. In September, he was signed to be a part of the Green Bay Packers replacement team. He was released at the end of the strike.

The men were recruited from the 184th Regiment of Virginia Militia and the company strength was 125 men. It was mustered into Confederate service on June 22, 1861. They were sent to White Sulphur Springs and assigned to artillery service. They were supplied with 4 artillery pieces, three 6-pounder smooth bore and one 10-pounder, which had been locally made. It was 2 months before enough horses were found to compose the teams for the unit. During this time an outbreak of measles was infecting the area. The battery was assigned to the command of Brig.

He is a tenured professor of developmental biology and genetics at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and director of the stem cell and cancer lab at its Faculty of Medicine. He was one of the first researchers in the world to use cell lineage tracing in cancer research and he showed for the first time the existence of cancer stem cells in solid tumors in vivo. He was selected by Nature as one of 10 People who mattered most in 2012 and he received the outstanding young investigator award of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Biography Born in Uccle in 1970., Cedric Blanpain attended Coll√®ge Saint- Hubert for his secondary education. Graduating in 1987, he started medical school with an aim of becoming a psychiatrist. As soon as his first year, he started doing research in human physiology at the Institut de Recherche Inter- Disciplinaire en Biologie Mol√©culaire and was thereafter introduced to molecular biology by Gilbert Vassart, the director of the IRIBHM. After graduating summa cum laude from medical school in 1995, Cedric Blanpain started a specialization in internal medicine. In the third year, he interrupted his clinical education to focus on research. He did his PhD in the lab of Marc Parmentier, dedicated to the study of G-protein coupled receptors. During this period, the Parmentier lab characterized the CCR5 GPCR and discovered its role as a co-receptor in HIV infection. Cedric Blanpain earned his PhD in 2001 for his work on CCR5 and HIV infection and received the 2002 Galen Award of Pharmacology in recognition of his graduate work. After earning his PhD, Cedric Blanpain went back to finish his board certification in internal medicine, sub-specializing in genetics. From there on, his career would be entirely dedicated to research. In 2002, he earned a fellowship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation to study in the USA. He did his post-doc with Elaine Fuchs (a lifelong mentor) at the Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development of Rockefeller University, studying epidermal stem cells and tissue differentiation. The Fuchs lab was one of the few labs then studying epidermal stem cells. He was also a long-term fellow of NATO and the Human Frontier Science Program during this period. In 2006, he accepted an offer from the Belgian National Research Fund to become an independent group leader at his home institute, the IRIBHM. He established the stem cells and cancer lab at ULB, becoming professor in 2013. He received a starting grant from the ERC in 2008 and a consolidator grant in 2014. He received a career development award from the Human Frontier Science Program. Since 2011, he is also an investigator of the Walloon Excellence in Life Science and Biotechnology (WELBIO). He pioneered the use of lineage tracing in cancer research. Ever since establishing his lab, Blanpain received several international awards, including the EMBO Young Investigator Award and the Liliane Bettencourt Award for Life Sciences 2012. He has also written several authoritative reviews on stem cells for journals such as Cell, Science, Cell Stem Cell and Nature. Research Cancer cell of origin, tumor stem cells and heterogeneity The Blanpain lab has been studying the cells at the origin of epithelial tumors as well as the role and the mechanisms by which cancer stem cells regulate tumor growth and relapse after therapy. His lab showed that basal cell carcinoma stem from cells of the interfollicular epidermis and infundibulum rather than hair follicles. In 2018, his lab identified the cell population in basal cell carcinoma that mediates vismodegib resistance. They also showed that the administration of Vismodegib in combination with a Wnt inhibitor leads to tumor eradication, a potential new strategy against BCC. They defined for the first time the quantitative dynamics of tumor initiation at the single cell level from the activation of the oncogene to the development of invasive tumors and demonstrated that the capacity of oncogene expressing cells to induce tumor formation depends on the specific clonal dynamics of the oncogene targeted stem cells at the origin of the cancer. The Blanpain lab has been studying the different cell states of the epithelio-mesenchymental transition that invasive tumor undergo: they demonstrated that different epidermal stem cells are responsible for invasive squamous cell carcinoma, that hair follicle lineage is primed to undergo EMT during tumorigenesis. They characterized the different transitional states of tumor cells during EMT, in particular they showed that specific subpopulations have higher potential to undergo EMT and metastasize. By screening a large panel of cell surface markers, Blanpain and colleagues identified the existence of different tumor subpopulations in skin and mammary primary tumors associated with different stages of EMT from epithelial to completely mesenchymal states passing through intermediate hybrid states. Although all EMT subpopulations presented similar tumor propagating cell capacity, they displayed different cellular plasticity, invasive and metastatic potential. The lab also showed the role of PIK3CA in inducing heterogeneity in breast tumors, especially its role in reprogramming basal cells into luminal ones and vice versa. They showed that cell fate reprograming during tumorigenesis correlated with the cell of origin, tumor type and different clinical outcomes of breast tumors. His team showed the first experimental evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells during unperturbed solid tumor growth in vivo. They also showed the role of VEGF in regulating cancer stem cells. In squamous cell carcinoma, his group also identified a novel population of cancer stem cells in skin cancers expressing Sox2, they demonstrated by lineage ablation that Sox2 cancer stem cells are essential for tumor initiation and progression in primary tumors and identified the gene network regulated by Sox2 in primary tumour cells in vivo as well as several direct Sox2 target genes controlling critical tumor functions. They also demonstrated the role of the Twist1 gene in cancer for tumor maintenance and growth, within squamous cell carcinoma again. Breast Gland Development Using lineage tracing of basal cells and luminary mammary gland cells during embryonic development and post-natal development, the Blanpain lab showed that different mammary tissue lineages stem from multipotent embryonic progenitors. These multipotent progenitors are replaced soon after birth by unipotent stem cells. His group developed new techniques to perform quantitative lineage tracing to unravel the multilineage differentiation potential of stem cells during development and adult homeostasis. Using novel lineage tracing strategies, they demonstrated that ER positive cells in the mammary gland developed and are maintained in adult gland through unipotent progenitors that are restricted to hormone receptor expressing cells. The differentiation of the multipotent progenitors into basal cells is mediated through p63 activation. Finally, these multipotent progenitors express similar genes as breast tissue tumors (e.g. Sox11, Stmn1 and Mdk), showing that reactivation of multipotency is involved in tumorigenesis. Epithelial stem cells After he started work at the Fuchs lab, Blanpain was part of a world-first: isolating stem cells based on their quiescence using histone H2B-fluorescent protein. The paper, cited more than 1900 times, has been seminal in subsequent work on stem cells. Using monoclonal antibodies, Blanpain managed to isolate hair follicle bulge stem cells and demonstrated their multi-potency (the fact that a single bulge stem cell can differentiate into all epidermal cell lineages). He also transplanted these mouse HF stem cells through grafts, leading to hair growth. Furthermore, he co-authored several papers characterizing the role of Wnt/Beta-Catenin stabilization in precocious bulge stem cell activation and the role of Notch signaling pathway in promoting spine cell development. CCR5 and HIV Cedric Blanpain started his research career working on the CCR5 co-receptor which had been characterized by the Parmentier lab. He worked on understanding the function of the receptor and how the HIV interacts with it. The young researcher showed that endocytosis of the HIV is essential to the cell's infection. He was able to find the first chemokine antagonist to the receptor as well as antibodies that could mediate the oligomerization of the receptor. He also studied the Delta32 inactivating allele of CCR5 which prevents HIV infection Awards and honors *Member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium *Member of Academia Europaea *Long-Term Fellowship (2003-2006) and Career Development Award (2006-2009) Human Science Frontier Program *Two ERC grants: Starting 2008-2013 (CancerStem) and Consolidator 2014-2018 (EXPAND) *EMBO Young Investigator Award *Outstanding Young Investigator Award of the ISSCR 2012 *Fondation ULB award 2010 *Joseph Maisin Award for basic biomedical Science- ‚ÄúPrix Quinquennal‚Äô‚Äô Belgian National Scientific Research Fund (FNRS) 2015. *Principal investigator of the Walloon Excellence in Life Science and Biothechnology (WELBIO) since 2011 *Fondation Leducq 22q11 Deletion Syndrome Grant *Liliane Bettencourt award for life sciences 2012 *Nature: ‚Äú10 scientists who mattered most in 2012‚Äù *Bauchau Chair award 2012 *Fond Gaston Ithier Award 2010 *Research Fellowship of the NATO (2002-2003) *Collen Research Fellowship of the Belgian American Educational Foundation (2002-2003) *Galien Award in Pharmacology 2001 *Prix Fleurice Mercier 1992 (medical school valedictorian)  References  Category:Belgian medical researchers Category:Living people Category:1970 births Category:People from Uccle Category:Universit√© libre de Bruxelles ","title":"C√©dric Blanpain"},{"id":"60093601","text":"Thomas Ellis Glover (1891‚Äì1938) was a cartoonist, caricaturist, court reporter and journalist, working in New Zealand and Australia.

It is located at a distance of circa 90 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 2974 is about 90,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on January 6, 1785. NGC 2974 is located in the sky about 2 and a half degrees south-south east of Iota Hydrae and more than 6 degrees northeast of Alphard. A 10th magnitude star lies next to the galaxy, thus making it a challenging object at low magnifications. NGC 2974 is part of the Herschel 400 Catalogue.  Characteristics  NGC 2974 by GALEX in ultraviolet, where an outer ring becomes visible. NGC 2974 has been categorised by G√©rard de Vaucouleurs as an elliptical galaxy, however there is evidence the galaxy has a disk. A rotating disk of neutral hydrogen with axis similar to that of the optical isophotes of the galaxy was detected in 1988 by Kim et al. They estimated the total HI mass to be . The galaxy in ultraviolet, as observed by GALEX, features an outer ring structure that holds about 1% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy and has a population of young stars. The radius of the ring is about 60 arcseconds, while one more, partial, ring has been detected in large radii. The galaxy also features multiple shells, which indicate that it has accreted material, probably by the merger of smaller galaxies. More detailed observations of the galaxy in HI by the Very Large Array revealed that the HI disk is in fact a ring. The observations also made it possible to measure the rotation curve of HI. The rotation curve rises quickly to a maximal velocity and then declines slowly until it flattens out at a lower velocity. This rotation curve is typical of galaxies with concentrated light distribution and could indicate that while the central part is dominated by visible mass, the outer parts are dominated by dark matter. The mass-to-light ratio is 4.3 /I at one effective radius and increases to 8.5 /I at 5 effective radii, where dark matter comprises at least 55 per cent of the total mass. Observations of the central area of the galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope revealed the presence of two gaseous spiral features, extending for about 200 parsecs. The kinematics of the central area show significant deviations from circular motions and they have been interpreted as the signature of a bar which is about 540 parsecs in diameter. The bar, although too weak to be detected in visual light is considered strong enough to channel material towards the central parsecs of the nucleus. Observations by SAURON (Spectrographic Areal Unit for Research on Optical Nebulae) confirmed the presence of the inner bar, while it was noted that it is possible that a large-scale bar exists too. The current star formation activity and morphological evolution of NGC 2974 has been attributed to the large bar. A ring observation in O III images may be associated with the inner bar or a nuclear ring. The nucleus of the galaxy has been found to be active and it has been categorised as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the centre of NGC 2974 is estimated to be between 140 and 210 million (10) based on the stellar velocity dispersion.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 2974 is the largest and brightest galaxy in the NGC 2974 group. Other members of the group include the galaxies MCG -01-25-024, UGCA 173, and UGCA 175. Other nearby galaxies include NGC 2967 and UGC 5228 with their groups.

The story is commonly handed down by parents to their children in order to instill moral values, as it is grounded in Buddhist thought. An alternative title, Kasako Jiz≈ç can be found in Iwate and Fukushima Prefectures. Its origins belong in the T≈çhoku and Niigata regions, with the oldest dispensations coming from Hokuriku, as well as areas of Western Japan such as Hiroshima and Kumamoto Prefectures. Its precise origin, however, remains unknown. Summary One day in the snowy country there lived an incredibly impoverished elderly couple. On New Year's Day, the couple realized that they were unable to afford mochi (a staple form of rice eaten during the New Year). The old man decided to go into town to sell his home-made kasa, but his endeavors proved unsuccessful. Due to the horrible weather conditions, the old man gave up the task and made his trek back home. In the blizzard, the old man came across a line of Jiz≈ç statues, to whom he decided to give his kasa as an offering, as well to keep their heads clear of snow. However, he only had enough kasa on hand to give to all but one statue. He gave the remaining statue his tenugui and went on his way. Upon returning home, he relayed the scenario to his wife, who praised him for his virtuous deed, without criticizing his inability to purchase any New Year mochi. That evening, while the couple was asleep, there came a heavy thumping sound from outside the house. They opened the door to find a great pile of treasures, consisting of such goods as rice, vegetables, gold coins, and mochi. The old couple watched on as the Jiz≈ç statues marched off into the snowy distance. Having repaid the old man for his selflessness, the couple was able to celebrate the New Year. Analysis While the tale has its visual basis in the bodhisattva K·π£itigarbha, the reciprocal character as expressed by the statues is reminiscent of the Shint≈ç deities known as toshigami. These deities are generally believed to bring about good fortune for the New Year and exist in a variety of regional forms, such as the Namahage of Akita Prefecture and the Toshidon of Kagoshima Prefecture. A similar comparison can be made regarding the marebito. Furthermore, while the presence of multiple Jiz≈ç tends to amount to six (in reference to the Jiz≈ç of the Six Realms motif), variations within the story exist such as there being only one, three, seven, or as many as twelve statues. Variations Some variations of the story are as follows: *The old man gives his own kasa in place of a tenugui *One Jiz≈ç statue returns the old man's gift rather than a group of statues *In place of Jiz≈ç, the Seven Lucky Gods repay the old man *In place of gifts, the old couple are escorted to the Western Pure Land There is a version of this story in Niigata called Chijimi Jiz≈ç wherein the old man uses ojiyachijimi fabric instead of a kasa. In another version, the old man's wife creates spools of thread to be sold in town. In Western Japan, there is a variation wherein the old man carries a Jiz≈ç statue back to his house. His wife becomes angry and rice pours out of the statue's body. Greedy for more rice, the wife pounds the statue's belly, at which point the rice stops flowing. Modern references In the Nintendo Switch video game Super Mario Odyssey, Bowser's Kingdom features an area where a row of five Jiz≈ç statues can be seen. They are all wearing kasa, possibly in reference to the folktale. This connection is further implied by the ability to possess a statue by striking it with Mario's cap. Also, Kasa Jiz≈ç is a unit in the game The Battle Cats, with one of the forms showing Jiz≈ç without his hat on, in reference to giving his last kasa away.

He worked at the history department of Montreal University.  Biography  Fr√©gault was born in Montreal on June 16, 1918. He lived his childhood and adolescence in Hochelaga, a working-class neighborhood of East Montreal. In 1937, he began publishing his first articles in L'Action nationale and La Rel√®ve. He studied at the Saint-Laurent College and, later, the Coll√®ge Jean-de-Br√©beuf. He soon enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, becoming a Bachelor of Arts in May, 1940. In the beginning, nothing special predisposed Fr√©gault to becoming one of the first \\"professional\\" historians of Quebec; on the contrary, he had devoted himself to teaching Greek, studying at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in Paris funded by the patronage of Bishop √âmile Chartier, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Vice- Rector of the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Chartier had been very impressed with Fr√©gault's excellent academic record, so Chartier assured him, on Fr√©gault's return from Paris, of his success to the profession of Greek. This program was about to end when the Second World War ruined his plans, along with the plans of many other young intellectuals also looking to stay in Europe. In 1937, his patriotic concerns led him to contacting Lionel Groulx, who, after having carefully read his plan for the R√©volution de l'Ordre laurentien (Revolution of the Laurentian Order), was \\"immediately interested in him.\\" In 1940, when hostilities became far more serious, remaining in France remained increasingly improbable. Groulx began to see Fr√©gault as a possible successor. Groulx offered that Fr√©gault studies in the Loyola University Chicago under the direction of Jean Delanglez. However, while Chartier wanted to make him a Classicist, Groulx tried to interest him with history. These prestigious offers give us a glimpse of the talent his contemporaries recognized in him (but they didn't fail to deeply embarrass him). In the end, the capitulation of France in June, 1940, was what decided his final choice of career. When Paris surrendered, Fr√©gault had no choice but to accept Groulx's offer and go to study as a historian in the United States. As Groulx was looking for a successor, he spares Fr√©gault a training stay in the United States to avoid what he experienced himself, \\"the chore of improvisation in a profession where one does not improvise.\\" Upon his arrival at Loyola University Chicago, Fr√©gault had no research subject. Father Delanglez, who was to be his advisor, offered him a spot at \\"The quarry of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville\\". Delanglez would come to strongly influence Fr√©gault. At first, he was a little disconcerted by the learning required as a historian, but he quickly adjusted and completed his studies at a fast pace. In June, 1942, just 18 months after his arrival in Chicago, he began writing his doctoral thesis, entitled Iberville the Conqueror, which was published in 1944. In the fall of 1943, Fr√©gault inaugurated the first historical methodology course that had ever been offered in a Quebec university and, at the same time, introduced the practice of history seminars while teaching a course on the public institutions of New France. Chartier, who was asked to appoint his successors for the seven positions he held at Universit√© de Montr√©al on June 24, 1944, entrusted Fr√©gault with Canadian literature. At the same time, also thanks to Chartier (who had a long-standing relationship with Grolier), Fr√©gault became one of the principle contributors to the French-Canadian of its encyclopedia, which began to appear in 1947. At the creation of the Institut d'histoire (Institute of History), Robert Rumilly took over from Fr√©gault at Grolier. A few months after the publication of Iberville the Conqueror‚Äîa book through which he would become the first winner of the Duvernay Award of the Saint- Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal‚Äîhe published The Civilization of New France. The close publication of the two works earned him a solid reputation as a historian as early as 1944. In 1945, aged 26, Fr√©gault became a founding member of the Acad√©mie des lettres du Qu√©bec and received the Vermeil Medal from the Soci√©t√© historique de Montr√©al (Montreal Historical Society). In 1947, he was the first recipient of the prix David, which he was awarded for Iberville the Conqueror and The Civilization of New France. From September, 1946, to May, 1947, he was the director of L'Action nationale. When he turned 30, Fr√©gault agreed to take over the direction of the new Institute of History at Universit√© de Montr√©al, having had already published over 100 articles and reports during the previous 10 years in major journals at the time. On top of this achievement he also wrote biographies and historical texts for the first French-Canadian edition of the Grolier encyclopedia in 1947‚Äî1948. After the creation of the Institute of History in early 1947, he became the Associate Professor and Director of it, a position he occupied (jointly with the vice- president of the Institute of History of French America, which was recently founded by Groulx) until his departure for the University of Ottawa in 1959. From the start of his directorship of the Institute of History of Montreal, Fr√©gault devoted himself entirely to the development of scientific history, which he conceived in an essentially national perspective. From 1948 to 1961, he received many honors and administrated responsibilities. Notably, he delivered three public works that definitively established him as the specialist on New France. In 1948, he published a large study named Fran√ßois Bigot, administrateur fran√ßais (2 volumes). Then, starting work with Groulx in the fall of 1949, he held the professorship of the same name, created for the occasion, until Maurice S√©guin replaced him in 1959. In 1949, he became permanent secretary of the Academie canadienne-francaise. In the fall of 1950, Fr√©gault was made the vice-dean and a professor of the Faculty of Arts; likewise, he held this role until his departure in 1959. In 1951, he was elected to the Canadian Historical Association Board of Directors, a position he held until 1954. In 1951, he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Latin Order of Charity. In parallel with his lectures and administrative activities, he and his wife pursued intensive research throughout the United States, which led to the publication of another biography in 1952, entitled The Grand Marquis - Pierre de Rigaud of Vaudreuil and Louisiana. In the same year, he visited a professor at the University of Toronto and participated in the creations of the History of Canada by the texts - 1534-1854 along with Michel Brunet and Marcel Trudel. Between 1952 and 1955, in secrecy, he worked to lay the foundations of what would, in 1955, become the Association of Professors of the University of Montreal, of which he was the first president. Also in 1955, Fr√©gault published what was to be his magnum opus, his masterpiece; The War of the Conquest. Thanks to this book, he became‚Äîfor the second time‚Äîa recipient of the prix David in 1959. In the meantime, in 1954, he published The Canadian Society under the French Regime and, in the same year, received the L√©o-Pariseau Prize of the French-Canadian Association for the Advancement of Science. At that time, his reputation as a historian reached its peak. \\"No jury,\\" writes Marie-Claire Daveluy, \\"is formed without him, if this jury exercises its mandate in the field that the historian has conquered by his personal culture and the publication of books that attest to his lucid version of the facts.\\" In 1959, Fr√©gault decided to leave the University of Montreal for the University of Ottawa, where he held the A.-J. Freiman, of which he was the first holder. From 1956 to 1961, he published several important articles which would later be put together in 1968 in a volume entitled The Eighteenth Century Canadian. He also received the J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal from the Royal Society of Canada in 1961 and the university of Ottawa recognized his outstanding contribution by giving him an honorary D.A. Beginning in 1961, he began a new career as the first Deputy Minister of the newly created Minist√®re de la Culture et des Communications (Ministry of Culture and Communications), a position he held from 1961 to 1966 and from 1970 to 1975. In the meantime, he held the positions of Commissioner General for External Cooperation at the Quebec Department of Intergovernmental Affairs and Special Advisor for the Prime Minister on Language Policy. Then, starting in 1975, he was special advisor on cultural matters to the Executive Council until his sudden death in 1977. In addition, in 1962 and 1968, he received two honorary doctorates, one from the Universit√© Sainte-Anne in Pointe-de-l'√âglise, Nova Scotia and the other from the University of Waterloo. He also received the Centennial Medal in 1982 and, in 1969, the Prix France-Qu√©bec from the Association des √©crivains d'expression fran√ßaise as well as the prix Montcalm from the Syndicat des journalistes et √©crivains for the 18th Century. Furthermore, also in 1969, he was the recipient of the Prix de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. When Groulx died in 1967, the Institute of the History of French America (May 1968 to May 1970) and the University of Montreal named him professor emeritus in 1970. Finally, during his years in the public service, Fr√©gault wrote and published two other important books: Chronique des ann√©es perdues in 1976 and, notably, Lionel Groulx tel qu'en lui-m√™me in 1978.

Anxious to compete at the Rossitten coastal gliding competition in 1923 Tank had the LFG-Stralsund works complete the glider in time for the competition; transporting the aircraft by horse-drawn cart. The 'B2' was characterized by warping wing-tips, in the hope of dispensing with ailerons. Construction was mixed with wooden structure covered with aluminium sheeting, which earned the Teufelchen a prize for best construction. After Tank crashed the B2 it was returned to Berlin and repaired at the Sablatnig works where it had been built. The B2 next attended the 4th Rh√∂n meeting in August 1923, where Tank had a hard landing. The 2nd Rossitten coastal meeting saw many of the competitors flying over the dunes and sea, including the B2, which M√∂ller was forced to land in and the B2 sank.

As of 2018, it remains an unsolved mathematical problem. Chern's conjecture states that the Euler characteristic of a compact affine manifold vanishes.  Details  In case the connection ‚àá is the Levi-Civita connection of a riemannian metric, the Chern‚ÄìGauss‚ÄìBonnet formula: : \\\\chi(M) = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\right )^n \\\\int_M \\\\operatorname{Pf}(K) implies that the Euler characteristic is zero. However, not all flat torsion-free connections on T M admit a compatible metric, and therefore, Chern‚ÄìWeil theory cannot be used in general to write down the Euler class in terms of the curvature.  History  The conjecture is known to hold in several special cases: * when a compact affine manifold is 2-dimensional (as shown by Jean-Paul Benz√©cri in 1955, and later by John Milnor in 1957) * when a compact affine manifold is complete (i.e., affinely diffeomorphic to a quotient space of the affine space under a proper action of a discrete group of affine transformations, then the conjecture is true; the result is shown by Bertram Kostant and Dennis Sullivan in 1975; the result would also immediately follow from the Auslander conjecture; Kostant and Sullivan showed that a closed manifold with nonzero Euler characteristic can't admit a complete affine structure) * when a compact affine manifold is a higher-rank irreducible locally symmetric manifold (as shown by William Goldman and Morris Hirsch in 1984; they showed that a higher-rank irreducible locally symmetric manifold can never admit an affine structure) * when a compact affine manifold is locally a product of hyperbolic planes (as shown by Michelle Bucher and Tsachik Gelander in 2011) * when a compact affine manifold admits a parallel volume form (i.e., with linear holonomy in SL(n, \\\\mathbb{R}); it was shown by Bruno Klingler in 2015; this weaker proven case was known as Chern's conjecture for special affine manifolds; a conjecture of Markus predicts this is equivalent to being complete) * when a compact affine manifold is a complex hyperbolic surface (as shown by Hester Pieters in 2016) Additionally obtained related results: * In 1958, Milnor proved inequalities which completely characterise those oriented rank two bundles over a surface that admit a flat connection * In 1977, Smillie proved that the condition that the connection is torsion-free matters. For each even dimension greater than 2, Smillie constructed closed manifolds with non-zero Euler characteristic that admit a flat connection on their tangent bundle For flat pseudo- Riemannian manifolds or complex affine manifolds, this follows from Chern‚ÄìGauss‚ÄìBonnet. Also, as proven by M.W. Hirsch and William Thurston in 1975 for incomplete affine manifolds, the conjecture holds if the holonomy group is a finite extension, a free product of amenable groups (however, their result applies to any flat bundles over manifolds). In 1977, John Smillie produced a manifold with the tangent bundle with nonzero-torsion flat connection and nonzero Euler characteristic, thus he disproved the strong version of the conjecture asking whether the Euler characteristic of a closed flat manifold vanishes. Later, Huyk Kim and Hyunkoo Lee proved for affine manifolds, and more generally projective manifolds developing into anaffine space with amenable holonomy by a different technique using nonstandard polyhedral Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem developed by Ethan Bloch and Kim and Lee. In 2002, Suhyoung Choi slightly generalized the result of Hirsch and Thurston that if the holonomy of a closed affine manifold is isomorphic to amenable groups amalgamated or HNN-extended along finite groups, then the Euler characteristic of the manifold is 0. He showed that if an even-dimensional manifold is obtained from a connected sum operation from K(œÄ, 1)s with amenable fundamental groups, then the manifold does not admit an affine structure (generalizing a result of Smillie). In 2008, after Smillie's simple examples of closed manifolds with flat tangent bundles (these would have affine connections with zero curvature, but possibly nonzero torsion), Bucher and Gelander obtained further results in this direction. In 2015, Mihail Cocos proposed a possible way to solve the conjecture and proved that the Euler characteristic of a closed even-dimensional affine manifold vanishes. In 2016, Huitao Feng () and Weiping Zhang, both of Nankai University, claimed to prove the conjecture in general case, but a serious flaw had been found, so the claim was thereafter retracted. After the correction, their current result is a formula that counts the Euler number of a flat vector bundle in terms of vertices of transversal open coverings. Notoriously, the intrinsic Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem of Chern that the Euler characteristic of a closed affine manifold is 0 applies only to orthogonal connections, not linear ones, hence why the conjecture remains open in this generality (affine manifolds are considerably more complicated than Riemannian manifolds, where metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness). There also exists a related conjecture by Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov on the vanishing of bounded cohomology of affine manifolds.  Related conjectures  The conjecture of Chern can be considered a particular case of the following conjecture: > A closed aspherical manifold with nonzero Euler characteristic doesn't admit > a flat structure This conjecture was originally stated for general closed manifolds, not just for aspherical ones (but due to Smillie, there's a counterexample), and it itself can, in turn, also be considered a special case of even more general conjecture: > A closed aspherical manifold with nonzero simplicial volume doesn't admit a > flat structure While generalizing the Chern's conjecture on affine manifolds in these ways, it's known as the generalized Chern conjecture for manifolds that are locally a product of surfaces.

A.G. Elias sat on the Manufacturers Aircraft Association's board of directors along with President Frank H. Russell, VP Glenn L. Martin, Charles L. Laurence, Chance M. Vought, S.S. Bradley, George P. Tidmarsh, and Donald Douglas. E.J Elias promoted the construction of a Buffalo municipal airport to aid the local fledgling airplane industry of five aviation companies constructing airplanes and airplane parts. From 1920-1925, Elias company's chief engineer, David Earle Dunlap (1896-1957), designed the Elias EM-2 Expeditionary planes. He designed the NBS-3 bomber fuselage and the Elias M-1 Mail plane. Dunlap's Elias TA-1 design was the first United States Army Air Corps Trainer to have a radial engine. After tests a McCook Field, the Army Air Corps selected other manufacturers over the Elias bomber and trainer. The company designed the Elias EM-1 to meet requirements for a multirole amphibian marine expeditionary aircraft. Elias delivered six production Elias EM-2 aircraft with Liberty engines to the United States Navy in 1922. Aircraft Elias Airmobile *Elias Airmobile *Elias EC-1 Aircoupe The EC-1 Aircoupe was a parasol wing monoplane powered by an Anzani engine which first flew in 1928. Orbis 1985, p. 1599 Designed by Joseph Cato, it had an open cockpit with a removable cabin enclosure. The airplane was known as the Airsport when flown without the cabin enclosure. The EC-1 was also available with a Kinner K-5 engine. One prototype is known, but more may have been produced. *Elias EM The Elias EM-1 was designed to meet a United States Marine Corps requirement for a multirole marine expeditionary aircraft. It was required to operate on either floats or wheels. The EM-1 was a tandem two-seat unequal- span biplane powered by a 300 hp (224 kW) Wright-Hispano H engine. The prototype was modified with equal-span wings and delivered to the Marine Corps in 1922. Six production aircraft were built (designated EM-2) having equal- span wings, being powered by 400 hp (298 kW) Liberty 12 inline engines. One production aircraft was delivered to the United States Marine Corps and five to the United States Navy. One of the Navy aircraft was modified as an observation aircraft and redesignated EO-1. Variants include: * EM-1: Prototype with a 300hp (224kW) Wright-Hispano H engine, one built. * EM-2: Production aircraft with a 400hp (298kW) Liberty 12 inline engine, six built including one later converted to an EO-1. * EO-1: One EM-2 aircraft converted as an observation aircraft. *Elias XNBS-3 The Elias XNBS-3 was a 1920s prototype biplane bomber built for the United States Army Air Corps. Andrade 1979, p. 136 The bomber had a steel tube fuselage and was powered by two Liberty 12A piston engines. It had a conventional landing gear with a tailskid and a crew of four. The prototype was designated XNBS-3 (XNBS=prototype night bomber short distance). On 13 August 1924 Lieutenant John A. Macready test piloted the Elias XNBS-3 twin engine bomber for the United States Army Air Corps at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. The XNBS-3 had New York to Chicago non- stop range and five machine guns for defense. It was similar to the earlier Martin NBS-1 and was no real improvement, so it was not ordered into production. *Elias TA-1 The Elias TA-1 was a 1920s American biplane training aircraft. Only three aircraft were built for evaluation by the United States Army Air Service. The TA-1 (a United States military designation Trainer, Aircooled No. 1) was designed to meet a United States Army requirement for a training aircraft for the air service. The TA-1 was a conventional two-seat biplane. Three were built, two with a Lawrance R-1 engine and another with an ABC Wasp, the last two under McCook field project numbers Elias P-178 and Elias P-179. The aircraft performance was inferior to the other aircraft under evaluation (the Dayton-Wright TA-3) and no orders were placed or further aircraft built.

The club includes a golf course, tennis courts, an aquatic facility, and two clubhouses. The golf course and the main clubhouse have impressive views of New York Harbor, the Atlantic Ocean, and the New Jersey highlands. For more than a century Richmond County has been the only private county club in New York City and is one of the oldest in the United States. History Richmond County Country Club was organized on April 18, 1888 by Clarence Whitman, W. Henry Motley, Adolph J. Outerbridge, Gugy M. Irving, Wethered B. Thomas, and Eugene H. Outerbridge. The club was officially incorporated in 1891. Richmond County Hunt Club had formed in 1887, and some of their members established RCCC to provide a place where people could socialize while participating in fox hunting and other sports that would eventually include golf and lawn tennis. For years Richmond County Hunt Club operated in close affiliation with RCCC sharing social activities and facilities. RCCC was founded in the same year as The Saint Andrews Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. St. Andrew's is one of the founding member of the United States Golf Association (USGA) and is considered the oldest continuously operating golf club in the United States. In 1901 RCCC had four classes of membership: Resident, Non-resident, Associate, and Summer. Summer members were permitted to join for 5 months only without an initiation fee. Resident and Non-resident membership had an initiation fee of $30, with the annual dues of $50 for Residents and $25 for Non-residents. Summer members paid dues of $35. Original location RCCC's original location was on the grounds of the former Vanderbilt estate, near Ocean Terrace and Little Clove Road on Staten Island, utilizing property that was owned by the Wittemann family. A two-story Victorian house was used as the clubhouse. When the club incorporated in 1891 it had over 60 members. In 1906, after the club moved, Charles Rudolph Wittemann established Wittemann Aeronautical Engineers and built the world's first commercial airplane manufacturing plant at the location. Golf Golf began at RCCC in 1894 led by club members George Hunter, George Armstrong, and James Park. The three members, who were all from England, had played golf at Harbor Hills Golf Course in New Brighton, which had opened in 1878, while visiting the island the previous year. At the time, Staten Island was a retreat for people living in the New York metropolitan area. Hunter and Armstrong were members at St. Andrew's, and had participated in one of the two \\"National Amateur Championship\\" that were conducted in 1894. Hunter, Armstrong, and Park designed a 9-hole course near the clubhouse, and Hunter donated a golf championship medal to the club. This medal has been awarded every year to the winner of the RCCC club championship qualifier since 1895, and remains one of the oldest commemoratives used continuously in American golf. In 1897, RCCC moved to its present location in Dongan Hills (also known at the time as Garretson), near Todt Hill, to accommodate the rising interest in golf. Member and property owner George Cromwell allocated land that was north of Four Corners Road on which the club built a nine-hole golf course. A year later, nine more holes were added on land rented from Cromwell that was routed away from the original nine. The new nine became known as the Meadow Holes. It was noted in the New York Times in 1898 that Albert E. Paterson won the opening day tournament with a score of 83. The early course totaled 5,175 yards, \\"with bogie figured at 77\\" and covered about 90 acres. The golf course's signature hole was the same hole as the current signature hole, the short par 3 third hole with a drop of over 100 feet from the tee to the green. In 1901, Paterson, who held the Hunter Medal at the time, was the owner of the amateur course record of 80 and Harry Vardon held the professional record of 71. At the time, the golf course scorecard looked as follows: Scorecard note: Bogey is considered PAR. The New York Tribune published a description of each hole, highlights of which included: *The 1st hole is known as \\"The Bay\\" on account of the fine view of the water. The ground slopes slightly to the right and the only notable hazard is a road 235 yards from the tee, which much be carried on the second shot. The green is terraced at the back and to the right, making judgment necessary in approaching it. *The 3rd is one of the distinctive features of the course, and though jocosely dubbed \\"Wee Drop\\", is in reality a descent of 100 feet in 112 yards. *On the 9th the bunker is only 85 yards out, but a road must be crossed on the second shot, and the bogie of 5 must be regarded as a fair one. *16th Now comes the longest hole on the course, \\"The Highlands\\", 480 yards from tee to green. *18th The home hole is only 144 yards long, but it requires the accurate play to cover it successfully in 3, the bogie figure. The first 50 yards is over an abandoned mine dump. A line of trees skirting the road will catch a slice, but a straight drive of 125 yards will lay the ball on the green, and will enable the player to equal bogie. On October 13, 1901, the New York Tribune described RCCC's location as \\"a 10 minute ride on the Midland Railway from the St. George ferry. Three-quarters of a mile away is Midland Beach, in plain view from the clubhouse, and the trolley service has been thus proved excellent for members running down from Manhattan for an afternoon's outing on the links.\\" In 1908, the original nine holes north of Four Corners Road were abandoned and sold as home sites, and the club bought additional land from which an 18-hole golf course on Todt Hill Road would be completed. In 1916, the current course layout was designed by Robert White, the first President of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) of America. In 1947, White was a founding member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects. In 1956 the 1st and 18th holes were par threes. The holes were laid out in 1916 to replace the longer 1st and 9th holes of the 1898 course. The par threes were created to eliminate the need to hit shots over Todt Hill Road. But golfers were still required to walk across the road to play the 2nd hole (today's 4th hole) and at the completion of the 17th hole (today's 3rd hole). In the 1950s, increased traffic was becoming an issue and the land used for both holes on the clubhouse side of Todt Hill Road was sold. The par threes were replaced by the current 11th and 12th holes. The land sale created some distance between RCCC's clubhouse and the golf course so a modern facility was built at the course to support all golf activities. The club's 124-acre golf course adjoins the domain of the Staten Island Greenbelt. The 10th and 11th holes skirt the mapped right-of-way, but never built, portion of the Willowbrook Parkway which was cancelled in the 1970s due to its impact on the Greenbelt. In 1989, the State of New York substantiated its commitment to the Greenbelt by purchasing the golf course, and then gave RCCC a 99-year lease for the land at a cost of $1 annually. In 2006, RCCC began working with golf course architects Ron Prichard, and Tyler Rae. With their help RCCC created a master plan that included deepening bunkers, expanding greens, and adjusting mounding. In 2018, the 17th and 18th holes were redesigned to lengthen the course and to take advantage of the golf course's topography capturing views of earlier versions of the golf course. Staten Island Amateur The Staten Island Amateur was first played in 1899 and was conducted each year at either RCCC or Fox Hills Golf Club, which had opened in 1900, through 1926. Through those years almost all participants were from one of the two clubs, and those who had duel memberships declared which club they were representing when submitting their application. The tournament has been played each year at RCCC since 1950. Bill Britton a tournament winner on the PGA Tour played in the championship twice before turning pro and won each time, defeating his brother Bob both times. Clubhouse In 1897, George Cromwell, who would soon become Staten Island's first borough president, assisted with the club's purchase of an estate on Todt Hill that included a large stately home. RCCC's clubhouse, known as the Alexander House, is a rare surviving antebellum mansion on Staten Island. It was built on 36 rolling acres in the 1840s or 1850s and originally attributed to Agatha Mayer (or Meyer). When the club bought the house, one side featured large stone retaining walls while the other side of the house had extensive grass lawns. The residence was owned by Junius Alexander who named the house ‚ÄúEffingham‚Äù after his family origins in Virginia. Mr. Alexander, who made money on Wall Street and through his railroad connections, lived with his family in the home from 1878 until his death in 1893 enjoying the views his property gave him of New York Harbor. Tennis Lawn tennis was growing in popularity in the 1890s. Americans had been introduced to the sport on Staten Island in the 1870s by Mary Ewing Outerbridge, a woman from a well known family in Bermuda, who had two brothers who were RCCC founders. One of these brothers, Eugene Outerbridge, was part of a small group of men who came together to establish the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1881. In September 1880, the first American national tennis championship had been organized and played at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club (now known as the Staten Island Cricket Club).\\"Lawn-Tennis on Staten Island\\". The New York Times. September 4, 1880. Retrieved May 2, 2012. In 1899, RCCC members took advantage of the lawns that surrounded the clubhouse to create quality grass tennis courts. In the early part of the 20th century RCCC summer members included International Tennis Hall of Fame member Robert \\"Bob\\" Wrenn, a winner of four United States singles tennis championships and future president of the United States Tennis Association; his brother, George Wrenn; and Arthur E. Foote, a winner of the New England tennis championship. Today, RCCC's Tennis Pavilion includes eight Har-Tru courts; a spa-like lounge, and a Pro Shop staffed with United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) professionals. Fox hunting RCCC was originally established to maintain a pack of hounds and to hunt fox, and quickly became one of the top hunt clubs in the area. But as the popularity of golf and tennis grew, and homes started to be built around Staten Island, fox hunting became impractical and was ceased in 1915. RCCC sent the club's English fox hounds to New Jersey where they were given to Monmouth County Hunt which had been operating since 1885. Club culture  Dress code  To maintain its standards as a privileged and exclusive establishment, the club, like many other older clubs, has a strict dress code with a detailed schedule of rules on what may be worn where and when.Dress code page of the club's website Course description Todt Hill postcard with player on the 3rd green, in front of the 5th green and the 9th green at the \\"highest point\\" on top of the hill in the background. RCCC's golf course routing is out and back, i.e. once you leave the 1st tee you will not return to the clubhouse until you reach the 18th green. There is a half-way house near the 10th green and the 13th tee. The course has a number of elevation changes with the front 9 eventually working its way close to the top of Todt Hill, the highest point along the American Atlantic seaboard south of the State of Maine. The 10th tee offers a wonderful view of the surrounding area. The golf course has small to medium size greens, some of which have multiple plateaus. The rolling topography and the course's proximity to New York Harbor make for some interesting putting challenges - first time players of the course will claim that some putts defy gravity and break uphill. Club member Ernest Flagg was considered one of the world's leading architects while he lived on Staten Island. He owned a large amount of land on Todt Hill, especially near the grounds of RCCC. Flagg was noted for his unique designs in which he used serpentine rock that was quarried from Todt Hill. The remains of one quarry can be seen below you as you move from the 2nd green to the 3rd tee. Many of the homes near RCCC, along Todt Hill Road and Flagg Place, were built using the quarried serpentine. St. Charles Seminary, a large mansion like structure near RCCC's main clubhouse, was Flagg's home.

The site was founded in 1997 with an initial focus on the major sports leagues in the United States and Canada and their individual teams, but has since grown to include a number of additional related features. Historical and commemorative logos and uniforms are included for teams and leagues, along with those for collegiate athletic programs and conferences, minor leagues, and international leagues. The site also hosts a discussion forum with nearly 40,000 registered users as of 2020, and posts regular news updates related to logos and team uniforms. History The site was founded by Chris Creamer in 1997, then a 14-year-old living in Oshawa, Ontario. He created it as a personal website to share his interest in sports logos. His family had gotten home Internet service the year before and he had previously set up an earlier personal site that covered a broader range of interests. It was at the recommendation of his father that he focus on one particular interest, so he chose sports logos. The website, which was hosted for many years on free servers like Angelfire, GeoCities, and Tripod.com using inline linking to images of the logos, was eventually able to move to its own hosting space through donations. The initial focus of the website was exclusively sports logos, both current and historical, from the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and was intended simply as a personal interest website. Being based in Canada, the site first featured logos from the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the National Hockey League (NHL). Over time, logos were added from other North American sports leagues from Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Basketball Association (NBA) to lesser known leagues like the American Basketball League. The site has grown to include logos from a number of additional professional and collegiate leagues, conferences, and organizations both in and outside of North America such the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), FIFA, the Olympic Games, and NASCAR. Uniform images‚Äîhistoric, current, and commemorative‚Äîwere later added for many of the sports, particularly the North American major professional leagues. Discussion forums were added as early as 1999 and have since grown to include nearly 40,000 registered users as of 2019. Regular news updates related to logos and uniforms were added around 2012, along with a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. By late 2015, SportsLogos.net had nearly 35,000 logo images hosted on the site and generated approximately 100 million hits per year. Both Creamer and the site are regularly referenced for logo and uniform-related news and imagery from a variety of media sources, including NHL.com, the Toronto Star, FoxSports.com, and CBSSports.com. As part of the redesign of the Sports Reference websites in 2016, an agreement was reached to use copies of the logo files on their various sites and pages, such as Baseball-Reference.com and Pro-Football-Reference.com.

Part of Sony's flagship Xperia series, the device was announced to the public at a press conference held at the annual 2019 Mobile World Congress event on February 25, 2019. It is the world's first smartphone with an ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio 4K HDR OLED display, dubbed CinemaWide, and Sony's first triple lens camera system featuring Eye AF eye-tracking technology seen in the company's Alpha line of professional-grade cameras. The Xperia 1 was later joined by a more compact variant, the Xperia 5, which was revealed on 5 September 2019. Compared to the Xperia 1, the Xperia 5 has a smaller 1080p screen, a smaller battery and a non-centrally aligned camera module. On 25 October 2019, a slightly revised version of the Sony Xperia 1 called the Sony Xperia 1 Professional Edition (J9150) was released exclusively in Japan,Sony Xperia 1 Professional Edition launched in Japan - GSMArena.com news which is mainly sold SIM-unlocked and unlike the Japan-only carrier models, features a hybrid dual-SIM slot and has an internal storage capacity of like the J8110, J8170 and J9110 models. The J9150 model however does not include support for 1seg mobile TV as well as Mobile FeliCa and Osaifu-Keitai, unlike said carrier-only models.Xperia 1Ôºà„Ç®„ÇØ„Çπ„Éö„É™„Ç¢ „ÉØ„É≥Ôºâ„Éó„É≠„Éï„Çß„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„Éä„É´„Ç®„Éá„Ç£„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ ‰ªïÊßò „ÇΩ„Éã„Éº„É¢„Éê„Ç§„É´ÂÖ¨Âºè„Çµ„Ç§„Éà Hardware Design and build The Xperia 1 is designed around the new 21:9 aspect ratio display, a rework from the previous \\"Ambient Flow\\" design seen in the Xperia XZ3. It consists of a 7000-series aluminum alloy chassis that has a curved edge all around the device, a 2.5D scratch-resistant front and curved-edged back glass panels made of Corning Gorilla Glass 6, resulting in a more squarish but symmetrical design aesthetic, reminiscent of the classic \\"OmniBalance\\" design language of old Xperia Z-series flagships. The most defining change in the Xperia 1, as it was in the Xperia XZ2 trio and the XZ3, are the placement of the camera on the back. It is centrally aligned on the upper half of the device, as opposed to being placed on the top-left side like in previous Xperia devices. The NFC antenna is placed on the left-hand side of the new triple-lens camera system, housed in a raised module with chrome beveled edges surrounding it, along with the color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) and the single LED flash up top. The front houses the ultra-wide 4K HDR OLED display with a slight curve corners and very minimal bezels on both sides, and a significantly slim (when compared to the XZ3) but asymmetrical top and bottom bezels. On the top bezel are the earpiece that acts as part of the hybrid dual-stereo speaker setup, the 8 MP front-facing camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and a notification LED. The hybrid SIM tray is located on the top of the device, with a sealed pull-out type cover for added ingress protection. The bottom bezel has shrunk significantly and is blank, omitting the company logo entirely, with the second part of the stereo speaker relegated to the bottom along with the lone USB Type-C port and primary microphone. The fingerprint sensor is now re-positioned back to the right-hand side of the device as with previous XZ Series devices, and is now activated even in the US market. This is possible, in part because the power button is now separate. To mitigate this, scanner is now an always-on affair. Directly above the fingerprint scanner is the volume rocker, and below the power button near the bottom edge is the 2-stage camera shutter button, very rare in smartphones nowadays and a unique staple of Xperia devices ever since. The Xperia 1's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . It is rated IP65/IP68 dust/water-proof up to 1.5 m for 30 minutes. The device comes in 4 colors: Black, White, Gray and in some markets, Purple . Performance The Xperia 1 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, built on a 7 nm process technology with 8 Kryo 485 processors in a 1 + 3 + 4 configuration (1x 2.84 GHz Gold Prime, 3x 2.42 GHz Gold, and 4x 1.8 GHz Silver), 6 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and an Adreno 640 for graphics rendering. It has the option of a 64 GB (SO-03L, SOV40 and 802SO models) or 128 GB (J8110, J8170, J9110 and J9150 models) UFS 2.1 internal storage and comes in a single-SIM or hybrid dual-SIM versions depending on region, with both featuring 5CA LTE Cat.19 of up to 1.6 Gbit/s download speeds. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 512 GB in a hybrid SIM 2 slot setup. Display The Xperia 1 showcases the world's first 21:9 aspect ratio 4K HDR OLED display officially called CinemaWide, with a 1644 x 3840 pixel resolution and 643 ppi pixel density. This aspect ratio was previously found in LG New Chocolate (BL40). In a more practical approach, the display resolution on regular usage and throughout the UI only is at 420 ppi, which is still considered sharp and is especially beneficial for the battery. The full 4K resolution only triggers automatically when compatible content is displayed on-screen. The Xperia 1 also has a new system-wide color setting feature, called \\"Creator mode\\", alongside the \\"Standard\\" and \\"Super-vivid\\" modes. When activated, the Xperia 1 tries its best to display accurate colors as close as possible to the original intention of the content creator. It has a BT-2022 certification for the HDR, which is more versatile than HDR10. The display itself supports the wide color space ITU-R BT.2020m as well as DCI P3 and Illuminant D65. It does however require the source to be encoded with the proper color info to take advantage of the feature. The device also has the new X1 for mobile engine borrowed from their BRAVIA TV line, optimizing content that is not natively-created for the high contrast and color palette of the OLED panel. Camera The back of a newly purchased Sony Xperia 1 (SO-03L model), showing the triple lens camera The Xperia 1 further improves and upgrades the previous Motion Eye camera from the XZ3 with a Sony-first Triple lens camera system. It is composed of the primary 12.2 MP 1/2.55\\" Exmor RS for mobile memory-stacked Dual Photo Diode (2PD) sensor with a 1.4 Œºm behind an f/1.6 aperture, 26 mm \\"regular wide\\" lens; a second 12 MP 1/3.4\\" RGB sensor with a 1.0 Œºm behind an f/2.4 aperture, 52 mm lens and 2x optical zoom for \\"telephoto\\"; and a third 12 MP 1/3.4\\" RGB sensor with a 1.0 Œºm sitting behind an f/2.4 aperture, 16 mm 130¬∞ \\"ultra-wide-angle\\" lens. They are paired with the RGBC-IR color spectrum sensor that assists the white balance of the camera by providing additional light data from the surrounding conditions of the scene, and a single LED flash. The front selfie camera has a 1/4\\" 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization). The Xperia 1 is capable of capturing 4K HDR video, and the two sensors (primary and telephoto) are optically-stabilized, a first for an Xperia device, dubbed Optical SteadyShot. It has an Intelligent Active Mode where it works alongside the standard electronic SteadyShot (5-axis EIS + OIS) for better video stabilization. Exclusive for the Xperia 1 is the BIONZ X for mobile image-processing engine, borrowed from Sony's Alpha professional cameras. This brings pro camera Alpha technologies to the Xperia line for a more professional approach to mobile photography. First and unique for the Xperia 1 is the new fast Eye AF. It is an intelligent focusing system that focuses and locks into a subject's eye for an impressively-accurate subject tracking. It can accurately calculate and measure the distance of the subject it is currently tracking from the device, and, through machine learning, can also remember the particular person's eye if he/she was either blocked by view or moved out of the frame for a while and then back in. An additional camera feature is Cinema Pro, which is a video capture application designed in collaboration with Sony's CineAlta division and squarely aimed at cinematography enthusiasts. Other unique camera features of the Xperia 1 include an Autofocus burst with up to 10 fps of AF/AE tracking, Predictive Hybrid Autofocus, an Anti-distortion shutter and RAW image file recording with RAW noise reduction. The Xperia 1 also has Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in DRAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos. Battery The Xperia 1 is powered by a non- removable 3,330 mAh lithium-ion battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C 3.1 port with support for USB Power Delivery. It also has Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in which allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. Battery Care The Xperia 1 also comes with Battery Care, Sony's proprietary charging algorithm that controls the charging process of the phone through machine learning. It recognizes the user's charging habits for a certain period and automatically adjusts itself to the pattern, for example an overnight charge, by stopping the initial charging to about 80‚Äì90 percent, and then continuing it until full from where it left off the next day. This effectively prevents the unnecessary damage to the battery's cells from excessive heat and current due to overcharging, further increasing the battery's life span. Audio and connectivity The Xperia 1, like the Xperia XZ2 that started it, has the standard 3.5 mm audio jack omitted in favor of wireless. To make up for the removal, it has improved wireless audio connectivity along with LDAC, an audio coding technology developed in-house by Sony which is now a part of the Android Open Source Project, that enables the transmission of 24-bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. It also comes with Dolby Atmos for a better sound reproduction. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX HD and Low Energy, NFC, 4x4 MIMO antennas for fast WI-Fi and cellular upload/download speeds, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia 1, like most high-end smartphone nowadays, has no FM radio. Software The Sony Xperia 1 is launched with the Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps. It features an improved Side Sense. It works through a pair of touch-sensitive areas on either side of the phone. A tap or slide triggers various actions set by the user, most of which configurable including the sensitivity of the touch areas. Another feature by the Side Sense is Pair shortcut which, upon launch from the Side Sense window, will trigger a split-screen setup with the selected pair of user-customizable apps instantly. In December 2019, Sony began to release Android 10 for the Xperia 1.

Representing (r,\\\\theta,z) as coordinates in the sense of cylindrical coordinate system with corresponding flow velocity components denoted by (v_r,v_\\\\theta,v_z), the stream function \\\\psi that defines the meridional motion can be defined as :rv_r = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z}, \\\\quad rv_z = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} that satisfies the continuity equation for axisymmetric flows automatically. The Hicks equation is then given by Batchelor, G. K. (1967). An introduction to fluid dynamics. Section 7.5. Cambridge university press. section 7.5, p. 543-545 :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r^2} - \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z^2} = r^2 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}H}{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\psi} - \\\\Gamma\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi} where :H(\\\\psi) = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} + \\\\frac{1}{2}(v_r^2+v_\\\\theta^2+v_z^2), \\\\quad \\\\Gamma(\\\\psi) = rv_\\\\theta where H(\\\\psi) is the total head and 2\\\\pi\\\\Gamma is the circulation, both of them being conserved along streamlines. Here, p is the pressure and \\\\rho is the fluid density. The functions H(\\\\psi) and \\\\Gamma(\\\\psi) are known functions, usually prescribed at one of the boundary. Derivation Consider the axisymmetric flow in cylindrical coordinate system (r,\\\\theta,z) with velocity components (v_r,v_\\\\theta,v_z) and vorticity components (\\\\omega_r,\\\\omega_\\\\theta,\\\\omega_z). Since \\\\partial/\\\\partial \\\\theta=0 in axisymmetric flows, the vorticity components are :\\\\omega_r = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_\\\\theta}{\\\\partial z}, \\\\quad \\\\omega_\\\\theta= \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_r}{\\\\partial z} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_z}{\\\\partial r}, \\\\quad \\\\omega_z = \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial (rv_\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial r}. Continuity equation allows to define a stream function \\\\psi(r,z) such that :v_r=-\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z}, \\\\quad v_z = \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} (Note that the vorticity components \\\\omega_r and \\\\omega_z are related to rv_\\\\theta in exactly the same way that v_r and v_z are related to \\\\psi). Therefore the azimuthal component of vorticity becomes :\\\\omega_\\\\theta = - \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi }{\\\\partial r^2} - \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi }{\\\\partial z^2}\\\\right). The inviscid momentum equations \\\\partial\\\\boldsymbol{v}/\\\\partial t-\\\\boldsymbol{v}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = - abla H, where H= \\\\frac{1}{2}(v_r^2+v_\\\\theta^2+v_z^2) + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} is the Bernoulli constant, p is the fluid pressure and \\\\rho is the fluid density, when written for the axisymmetric flow field, becomes : \\\\begin{align} v_\\\\theta \\\\omega_z - v_z\\\\omega_\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_r}{\\\\partial t} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial r},\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_z\\\\omega_r - v_r \\\\omega_z - \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_\\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}&=0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_r\\\\omega_\\\\theta - v_\\\\theta \\\\omega_r - \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_z}{\\\\partial t} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial z} \\\\end{align} in which the second equation may also be written as D(rv_\\\\theta)/Dt=0, where D/Dt is the material derivative. This implies that the circulation 2\\\\pi rv_\\\\theta round a material curve in the form of a circle centered on z-axis is constant. If the fluid motion is steady, the fluid particle moves along a streamline, in other words, it moves on the surface given by \\\\psi=constant. It follows then that H=H(\\\\psi) and \\\\Gamma=\\\\Gamma(\\\\psi), where \\\\Gamma=rv_\\\\theta. Therefore the radial and the azimuthal component of vorticity are :\\\\omega_r = v_r\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\psi}, \\\\quad \\\\omega_z = v_z\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\psi}. The components of \\\\boldsymbol{v} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} are locally parallel. The above expressions can be substituted into either the radial or axial momentum equations (after removing the time derivative term) to solve for \\\\omega_\\\\theta. For instance, substituting the above expression for \\\\omega_r into the axial momentum equation leads to : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\theta}{r}&= \\\\frac{v_\\\\theta \\\\omega_r}{r v_r} + \\\\frac{1}{rv_r}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dH}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\psi} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d\\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\psi}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm dH}{\\\\mathrm d\\\\psi}. \\\\end{align} But \\\\omega_\\\\theta can be expressed in terms of \\\\psi as shown at the beginning of this derivation. When \\\\omega_\\\\theta is expressed in terms of \\\\psi, we get :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r^2} - \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z^2} = r^2 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}H}{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\psi} - \\\\Gamma\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\Gamma}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi}. This completes the required derivation.

Mostly uneducated, he made a living as a hunter and trapper until the American Revolutionary War broke out, whereupon he served for a while as a scout for the Continental Army, then switched sides, and became one of the more picturesque minor figures of the war. Early years Daniel McGirt was born to James McGirt and Priscilla Davison; the family was respected and well- established in the Camden area. His father was a prosperous miller who had acquired a grant on the Wateree River of 400 acres of land five miles below Camden, at the horseshoe bend in the river then called the \\"Great Neck, near Mulberry. McGirt was probably born here at the plantation the family called the ‚ÄúHermitage‚Äù, though most of his father's lands seem to have been lower downstream. Wells' Register and Almanac for 1775 records that James McGirt held offices of trust and confidence, serving as a lieutenant-colonel in Richard Richardson's regiment of the provincial militia. It was probably he, and not his son Daniel as stated in the South Carolina Gazette of April, 1769, who, with Cols. Richardson and William Thompson, acted with such \\"great spirit, discretion and success\\" in suppressing the Schofield provocations on the Saluda River. The Gazette characterizes the three colonels as \\"gentlemen of great reputation and highly esteemed by the whole body of backsettlers.\\" The elder McGirt later served as a court justice,Ward 2002, p. 203 and one of his daughters married Capt. John Cantey, the founder of the Camden branch of that family. Dr. Joseph Johnson says in his book, Traditions and Reminiscences, Chiefly of the American Revolution in the South, that the elder McGirt remained loyal to the American cause throughout the war, but there is no evidence to confirm this. Kirkland and Kennedy, authors of Historic Camden: Colonial and Revolutionary, are inclined to believe that he remained true to the Crown, and retired with his family to East Florida around the beginning of the conflict. This might be inferred from a letter written by William Ancrum, who lived in Charleston but was one of the largest landowners in the Camden area, and who knew all the families thereabouts. It is directed to his agent at the Congarees, on May 9, 1778, and concerns the recent stealing of three slaves from his plantation at that location. He writes: \\"It is suspected that some of the McGirts who were formerly settled near Camden and some time ago retired to East Florida and who, it seems, have given themselves up to these scandalous practices are the perpetrators of this villainy, who have also taken off with them a great many horses from the settlements on the Wateree River.\\"Kirkland Kennedy 1905, pp. 298‚Äì299 It is unlikely that James McGirt, given his reputed character, would have participated in these thefts; it was almost certainly another son, James, Jr., who joined Daniel McGirt in his misdeeds. Scout for the Continental Army In the early days of the Revolutionary War, Charles and Jermyn Wright, brothers of Georgia's Governor Wright, built a fort at their plantation on the Florida side of the St. Marys River. This fort, which was named Fort Tonyn for the governor of East Florida, Patrick Tonyn, became a refuge for the Tories of Georgia, from which they made numerous raids on the southern settlements of that province. In mid-May 1776, Capt. John Baker marched against the fort with 70 mounted men. His plan was to wait until nightfall, surprise the fort by a sudden assault and then make a rapid retreat. His movements were conducted with great secrecy, but his approach was discovered by a slave, who alerted the fort's defenders. Three cannon were fired from the fort and were answered by the schooner St. John of eight guns lying in the river a short distance below. Baker, surmising that this was a signal for reinforcements from the schooner, placed his men in ambush along the banks and fired on the boats as they came up the stream. Several of the British were killed, wounded or captured, and from one of the prisoners Baker learned that a large body of Indians was encamped near the fort. He then retreated eight or nine miles before making camp for the night. During the darkness two of his men, Daniel and James McGirth, stole nearly all the horses belonging to the company and deserted to the enemy. The loss of the horses caused the failure of the expedition and Baker returned north to Georgia. For his act of daring Daniel McGirth was later made a lieutenant colonel in the Florida Rangers. Daniel McGirth escapes from jail on his fleet mare, ‚ÄúGrey Goose‚Äù. Dr. Johnson recounts a tradition purporting to explain the reason for young McGirt's desertion of the patriot cause. He says that as a young man, Daniel McGirt was an accomplished hunter and rider, intimately familiar with the woods and trails from the Santee River to the lands of the Catawba Nation. He was a valuable scout to the Americans, as much for his courage as for his accurate knowledge of the countryside.Kirkland Kennedy 1905, p. 299 McGirt's driving passion before the war had been the breeding and racing of fine horses.Kirkland Kennedy 1905, p. 300 His favorite mount was an iron-grey mare that he called ‚ÄúGrey Goose‚Äù. At Satilla, Georgia, a militia lieutenant, Clarke Christie, coveted the horse, and offered McGirt a lieutenant's commission in exchange for it, but he was refused. Not being able to get the horse by other means, Christie swore that he would have her by force. The threat led to a confrontation in which Daniel either struck the officer or threatened to do so. For this he was court-martialed and found guilty of striking an officer, a very serious offense, then publicly whipped with ten lashes and confined in the local jail. By the terms of his sentence, two more whippings were subsequently to be inflicted. Stung by this disgrace, McGirt determined to escape, and succeeded by dislodging the window bars of his cell with a broken trowel probably passed to him by a guard. Mounting ‚ÄúGrey Goose‚Äù, who happened to be tethered nearby, he dashed away, turning in his saddle as he rode off to hurl threats of vengeance. McGirt fled to St. Augustine where he was made a lieutenant colonel in Thomas Brown's East Florida Rangers. Loyalist raider Daniel McGirt was attached to Brig. Gen. Augustine Pr√©vost's army on its devastating raid of 1779 through lower Carolina in which plantations were laid waste and robbed of all their valuables‚Äî live stock, silver plate, provisions, and enslaved blacks. Commenting on this, the Gazette of July 7, 1779, says that with Prevost was: Again, on July 28, 1779, the same journal remarks: {{quote|\\"A report prevailed that Brig.- Gen. Prevost was ordered to New York under an arrest for not having done more mischief in this State than he did. But, if it be true that he was in copartnership to share all plunder, whether in plate, horses, or Negroes, with the famous McGirt (as was confidently affirmed by most of the British officers while they were in this neighborhood), the general will have no cause to regret even a dismissal from their service, for McGirt himself has declared that his own share of what he has stolen amounting to his weight in gold, he is now satisfied and will immediately quit his thieving and settle in West Florida.\\"Kirkland Kennedy 1905, pp. 300‚Äì301 One of Daniel McGirt's alleged acts of daring was commonly believed to have given a name to a locality in his home province. It was said that with a companion he once ventured to make a secret reconnaissance in the swamps on the western side of the Wateree River. Some patriots of the area, learning of his presence, determined to entrap him. Suspecting that he would wish to cross a creek with very high banks, on the Bettyneck plantation ten miles below Camden, they removed the only bridge at that point and concealed themselves on either side of the way. McGirt and his comrade rode blindly into the ambuscade, but, putting spurs to their horses, passed unscathed by the musketry fire until they reached the chasm. Retreat was impossible, so both urged their horses to the leap, the distance from bank to bank being about twenty feet. McGirt passed safely over, but his attendant perished in the attempt. The stream has since been known as ‚ÄúJumping Gully.‚Äù Despite this tradition, a plat of James McGirt's lands in the Fork of the Wateree, made May 4, 1756, shows that this stream was, even at that early date, already known as ‚ÄúJumping Gully.‚Äù After the war, McGirt took his band of brigands to Florida, where they seem to have maintained themselves for a while by their wits and skillful use of their weapons. The contemporary Charleston papers provide occasional glimpses of McGirt and his band. The South Carolina Gazette and Public Advertiser of April 3, 1784, says: ‚ÄúBy a gentleman arrived this week from St. Augustine, we learn that the notorious McGirt, who came into this State with Prevost's army in 1779 and committed numberless depredations on the inhabitants, is confined in the castle of that place for several robberies committed by him and his party in that province.‚Äù The historian David Ramsay summarizes McGirt's career thus: After Gen. Cornwallis and Col. Tarleton defeated Gen. Gates and the Patriot forces at the Battle of Camden in 1780, McGirt and his fellow Loyalist Rangers Thomas Brown and William Cunningham returned to South Carolina from their exile in East Florida to exact revenge for the mistreatment they had suffered at the hands of their former neighbors. During and after the war, McGirt led an interracial gang that relied on corrupt government, intimidation of local officials, and election fraud to avoid accountability for their thefts of livestock and other property, as well as the kidnapping of slaves, in Georgia. They terrorized the populace with rape and violence, using the international border between that state and East Florida to escape justice. With the proclamation of Britain's return of Florida to Spain by terms of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, disorder and confusion were rampant in East Florida. Lawless men took advantage of the situation to raid plantations and houses along the lower St. Johns River, looting slaves, provisions, and livestock. The most notorious among them was the gang led by McGirt, who had assembled a band of mounted men, mostly refugees and vagrants, with the Loyalist John Linder from the South Carolina Lowcountry as his chief lieutenant. To protect the settlers from the \\"banditti\\", as he called them, Governor Tonyn raised two troops of light horse under the command of Lt. Col. William Young, and ordered him to bring the marauders to justice, characterizing them as \\"murderers and assassins\\". When the bandits William Cunningham, Stephen Mayfield, and Daniel Cargill were implicated in the theft of silver and other valuables from houses at St. John's Towne (St. John's Bluff), Governor Z√©spedes had them and McGirt arrested and thrown into the Castillo de San Marcos (St. Mark's Castle). The prisoners were transported to Havana in late April 1785, along with papers containing the petitions for leniency recommended by Tonyn and a decree of exile issued by Z√©spedes. These were forwarded to Bernardo de G√°lvez, the Captain General of Cuba, who had gone to Mexico to take office as the newly- appointed Viceroy of New Spain. G√°lvez approved their banishment, and ordered that the prisoners be permitted to emigrate to any non-Spanish territory and to take their families and property with them. A few weeks later the troublemakers left Havana with passports for New Providence in the Bahamas; Mayfield arrived, but McGirt and Cunningham had jumped ship and landed on the East Florida coast. They were soon caught and again put aboard a ship to New Providence. Later years The history of McGirt's later years is uncertain. McGirt's confinement for several years in the damp dungeons of the fortress permanently damaged his health. Kirkland and Kennedy assert that he abandoned his life of adventure and outlawry, seeking asylum at the home of his brother- in-law, Col. John James, of Sumter District in South Carolina, where his wife, a sister of Colonel James, had lived in seclusion during the war, faithful to her husband. Supposedly McGirt passed the remaining years of his life peacefully in her company, his identity carefully concealed. Part of this time was passed under the protection of his nephews, Zachary and James Cantey, in Camden. The Georgia historian Lucian Lamar Knight agrees that McGirt was ill and retired to Sumter District in South Carolina, where he soon died, while Joseph Johnson also gives the story that Daniel McGirt ended his checkered career at the home of Col. James, in misery but not in want, and that his widow long survived him.\\"Knight1917\\", p. 295 However, a land grant by Enrique White, the governor of East Florida, dated 20 November 1797, gives Daniel McGirt permission to return to Florida and settle on his father's lands. He was found living on those tracts in Nassau along the St. Marys River in the general survey made by the Spanish government in 1801. There is an entry in the baptismal records of the Catholic church at St. Augustine recording the birth of John Robert McGirt to Daniel McGirt and Susana Ashley in that city on 4 September 1798.

Mar√≠a Esperanza Bofill Ferrer (30 March 1888 in Villahermosa, Tabasco - 7 November 1962 in Mexico City), better known by her stage name Esperanza Iris, was a Mexican singer, leading lady, and stage actress.  Early life  Tovar Born in Villahermosa, Tabasco March 30, 1888, her birth name was Mar√≠a Esperanza Bofill Ferrer, but her stage name was Esperanza Iris. She began her artistic career in the theater company Austri and Palacioscon in the play Las campanas de Carri√≥n, which lasted for five years. Then in 1902 in the Teatro Principal she participated in La cuarta plana, for which she won the respect of the public. In Brazil she was famous for \\"La Reina de la Opereta\\" and ‚ÄúEmperatriz de la Gracia,‚Äù and in Spain she was decorated by King Alfonso XIII. Iris went on an international tour to Cuba between 1910 and 1911 with the play La viuda alegre.  Construction of her theater  In 1918 she constructed her own theater, el Gran Teatro Esperanza Iris, built by architect Federico E. Mariscal. It was inaugurated in the presence of President Venustiano Carranza. In 1922 she was declared \\"Hija Predilecta de M√©xico,\\" or \\"Favorite Daughter of Mexico\\" and filmed two movies: Mater nostra and Noches de gloria. She organized a choir in the penitentiary Lecumberri when her husband Paco Sierra was a prisoner after an incident in 1952. Her last theater performance was in the play La viuda alegre. Esperanza Iris died on November 7, 1962 in Mexico City. Her remains were interred in the Pante√≥n Jard√≠n.  Homage  To pay homage to her artistic trajectory in Mexico, the state theater of Tabasco was rechristened Teatro Esperanza Iris. After a period, the theater Iris built in Mexico City went only by \\"Teatro de la Ciudad,\\" but during the government of Marcelo Ebrard it returned to its original name: Teatro de la Ciudad Esperanza Iris. Mexico City's Historical Center was named a World Heritage Site in 1987 by the United Nation's Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

It is owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), and operated by the Kituwah Preservation and Education Program (KPEP); New Kituwah is a separate entity from Cherokee Central Schools. The school is part of a larger effort by the EBCI to save and revitalize the heavily-endangered Cherokee language and instill Cherokee cultural pride. The word kituwah () is used by the Eastern Cherokee to refer to both themselves and their language; it can also mean \\"center\\" or \\"mother town\\" depending on context. Background There were 1,520 Cherokee speakers out of 376,000 Cherokee in 2018 according to Ethnologue, which classified the language as \\"moribund\\", meaning children are not learning and speaking the language. Only a handful of people under 40 years of age are fluent in Cherokee, and about 8 Cherokee speakers die each month. The Eastern dialect present in North Carolina (which is taught at New Kituwah) was known by about 220 Eastern Band speakers in 2018. UNESCO considers the North Carolina dialect of Cherokee \\"severely endangered\\". In June 2019, the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes‚Äîthe EBCI, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians‚Äîdeclared a state of emergency for the language due to the threat of it going extinct, calling for the enhancement of revitalization programs. A tally by the three tribes had garnered a list of ~2,100 remaining speakers. There is also the Cherokee Immersion School (Tsalagi Tsunadeloquasdi) in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. History and operations In the 1990s, Cherokee Chief Joyce Dugan oversaw the creation of the Cultural Resources Division of the EBCI. The idea of an immersion school came up as other native peoples worldwide, such as the MƒÅori, Hawaiians, Mohawk, and Piegan, had successfully created their own immersion programs. Later, in April 2004, a preschool immersion program was opened in the Dora Reed Childcare Center; these children comprised the first kindergarten class when the school opened. Chief Michell Hicks was largely responsible for finally establishing the academy, which before opening in its current location underwent a $6.5 million renovation funded by the EBCI and a $1.3 million grant from the Cherokee Preservation Foundation. The academy is located on the 309-acre site of the former Boundary Tree hotel and resort. After four years of moving between buildings, New Kituwah opened in its newly remodeled, permanent building on September 8, 2009, and the school held its grand opening ceremony on October 7, 2009. Cherokee instruction in a classroom at New Kituwah Cherokee language instruction is a feature of New Kituwah, and inside the school is a prominent sign that states \\"English stops here.\\" However, in order to meet North Carolina's education standards, the school begins to introduce English to students in the later grades. Similar to many other indigenous languages, there are few living fluent speakers of Cherokee, so many of the school's instructors are not fluent themselves. As of 2019, after 15 years of operations, the school has not yet produced a fluent speaker. The school was featured in the 2014 documentary First Language: The Race to Save Cherokee, which focuses on the dialect of Cherokee spoken in North Carolina, and was also the focus of an undergraduate honors thesis project in 2017.Albee, Elizabeth, \\"Immersion Schools and Language Learning: A Review of Cherokee Language Revitalization Efforts among the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians\\" (2017). University of Tennessee Honors Thesis Projects. Tribal elder Myrtle Driver Johnson, who was given the title of Beloved Woman from the EBCI and is fluent, has been an active volunteer translator for the school. For New Kituwah, Johnson translated E. B. White's Charlotte's Web; one copy was given to the White estate and New Kituwah kept 200 books. Other posters and materials in Cherokee are designed by local artists and printed nearby. New Kituwah was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in January 2015.

Career  Henry was born in Bristol in 1969 where she attended Bristol Grammar School, an independent day school. She later studied economics at University College London (UCL), graduating in 1990. Henry followed her older brother in studying economics and later on stuck with her studies as she learned to appreciate economics and politics, while being quite proficient at the subject. During her academic years, pursuing a career in finance was not her ambition. After graduating from UCL, Henry aspired to become a foreign correspondent at the Financial Times, however Henry began her career as an Assistant Economist, analysing economic data for Asia under the Economic Intelligence Unit in 1991, and later become the main analyst in 1994. The EIU provides business and governments with economic data, and provides detailed reports on trending business challenges through a client based operation. While her time at the EIU, she relocated from London to Hong Kong, where she was later scouted by a former EIU colleague to join HSBC near the beginning of the Asian financial crisis. By 1996, Henry started her career with HSBC at HSBC Securities as an Asia Economist for two years before moving to HSBCIB (Investment Banking) as a Global Economist for 8 years. Henry later on became the Chief European Economist in 2007 for 8 years and finally her current position as Global Chief Economist in 2015. Janet Henry will be replacing Stephen D. King as he takes the role Senior Economic Advisor after being with the bank for 17 years. Henry will be responsible for HSBC's economic forecasts and reporting to the head of research David May. Henry is also a member of Handelsblatt's Shadow ECB Council.  LSE Emerging Markets Forum 2018  Henry spoke at the London School of Economics' 9th annual Emerging Markets Forum that was hosted in London, United Kingdoms. The two-day forum was held at De Vere Grand Connaught Rooms between 9 and 10 March. This conference invited over 200 global leaders in the economic field ranging in different industries including real estate, pharmaceuticals and finance. This event also hosted a wide range of media coverage including Bloomberg, The Economist, and BBC News. Henry participated in a panel discussion on 9 March named \\"Central Banking and FX ‚Äì Looking for a route in turbulent waters; Emerging markets challenges in the rate normalisation era\\", which included five other speakers from the industry, hosted by Esteban Lee, Speakers officer of LSE and moderated by Lyubov Pronina, Bloomberg EMEA reporter.  Global Female Leaders 2019  Henry will be attending the Global Female Leaders Summit between 12 and 14 May. The summit focuses on gathering female leaders from different industries to share about their successes and experiences, contributing to the dialogue of women empowerment in society. The summit is designed to promote dialogue around how female business individuals can make an impact in the growing global climate of economics and business relations to better improve diversity and use leadership skills between both men and women.  Publications and appearances   HSBC News and Insight article  On 17 October 2018 Henry published an article named \\"Diverging fortunes for world economies\\" on HSBC's News and Insights section of their website. She discusses economic growth trend of several states, mentioning that the United States are benefiting off of personal tax cuts and low unemployment and have contributed to their high rate of consumer confidence. Henry continues on to state that after raising their 2018 growth forecast for the United States to 3%, their estimate for global growth for 2018 to be 3%, followed by 2.7% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020. Henry states that emerging economies have long-run potential in growth compared to pre-existing developed countries. Emerging economies have advantages in demographics and will to grow rapidly if they continue to improve social infrastructures and programs such as education, health care, and technological advances. According to Henry's model projections, China will outgrow the United States as the largest economy by 2030, in addition to India growing ahead of Germany and Japan as the third largest economy.  HSBC Insights video  On 25 March 2019 Henry appeared in a HSBC Insights video \\"The world slows down‚ÄîCentral banks pivot on interest rates in case downturn worsens\\". In the video, Henry discusses the reasons behind the central bank pivots due to a slowdown in global economic growth and inflation. She forecasts that by the midyear of 2019, China will stabilise and the United States growth will revive after the recent government shutdown. She mentions that two sectors are particularly impactful to the economic downturn, the auto and electronic industries, both of which account for a majority of production in countries like South Korea and Germany. Henry predicts that economic growth will not rapidly grow globally solely from a US-China trade deal because of rising tensions arising between US and European countries. She concludes that federal interest rate setters will cut in 2020, but that will be dependent on the expectations of the effects of a rising inflation rate to prevent the dollar from rising.  Bloomberg  On 7 August 2018 Lucy Meakin and Jeanna Smialek from Bloomberg Markets interviewed three women who are now Chief Economists in the world's few largest banks. The article \\"These Three Women Made It to Chief Economist at Big Banks. Here's How They Got There\\" included Henry as one of the three women. Through this interview, Henry discussed some of the difficulties and experiences of being a women in her occupation. She mentioned that when she joined HSBC back in 1996, she was the only woman on her global economics team and now 13 out of 39 of her global group are women. Bloomberg highlights Henry's recent accomplishments, such as forecasting that the European Central bank will undergo quantitative easing or warning that the U.S. tightening of finances along rising oil prices and President Trump's \\"aggressive trade policies\\" will harm the global economy. Henry laughs while describing her career, saying that \\"A lot of the progress in my career happened as a consequence of the euro crisis. You‚Äôre always going to have a higher profile as an economist when things are not going well.\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:1969 births Category:British economists Category:British women economists Category:Alumni of University College London Category:People educated at Bristol Grammar School ","title":"Janet Henry (economist)"},{"id":"60096071","text":"This article lists the main modern pentathlon events and their results for 2015.

She arrived to the New World in 1528 to reunite with her husband, Alonso de Estrada. Ancestry and early life She was born in Almagro, a city that was home to a powerful Jewish community. Her mother was Mayor Flores de Guevara, belonged to the local nobility and was distantly related to Isabella I of Castile. She was part of a well-respected and prosperous family. Through her, Marina acquired noble status and the right to the title of do√±a. Her father, Juan Gutierrez de la Caballeria was a highly successful merchant and supplier of the Order of Calatrava. Marina had five siblings who lived until adulthood. Four of them, like Marina, kept their mother's last name first, a common practice in Spain when the mother's last name was the most prestigious; a fifth one kept his father's last name first and his mother's second. Modern historians believe that Marina belonged to a family of New Christians. Marina's family were known as a converso family in the city. Despite this, the family was well respected, strongly involved in the city's daily life, and in its power structure. Five of Marina's relatives were members of the city council, and the family's forebears had been long time royal advisors. The ambience of tolerance towards the Jews and conversos in Spain was approaching its end though. After the Alhambra Decree various Jewish families of Almagro chose to leave the city instead of converting. Those who converted faced a period of close scrutiny by the Spanish inquisition due to concerns of Crypto-Judaism. Marina's family didn't suffer this inconvenience as much as others. In their case, as in the case of many other converso families that were considered of proven loyalty or towards whom the crown felt indebted, the crown issued special documents declaring them pure of blood regardless of their ancestry. Marina spent her youth being taught the proper ways for a woman. Elizabeth Howe believes that, thanks to her family's proximity to Isabella, Marina probably benefited from the insistence of Queen Isabella on the education of noble women in every other subject, such as math and history. This would explain her impressive future impact on Mexican society. Despite their certificate of purity of blood, it's possible that the growing religious tensions limited Marina's options to marry within her own city.\\"La-sangre-limpiada of Marina Flores Gutierrez de la Caballeria\\" Colonial Latin American historical review: CLAHR 11(1):35-54 ¬∑ December 2002 Married life In 1508 Marina married Alonso de Estrada in Ciudad Real. Alonso de Estrada was the illegitimate son of King Ferdinand II and had been raised in the royal court, was of old Christian blood, respected in Ciudad Real, wealthy, and fiercely intelligent. Their partnership produced the best possible scenario. As the nephew of Charles I of Spain, Alonso ascended quickly. Marina took charge of the administration of the couple's ever-growing estates and possessions, while her husband traveled to Mexico City in service of the king. They had five children together. In 1522 Alonso was given the position of treasurer and governor of New Spain and had to depart for the New World. Marina stayed behind with their children until she considered that her eldest child--a son--was ready to take charge of the family's properties, then she readied to travel to the new world. Trip to America There were various voyages organized by the crown to reunite conquerors in America with their families. It is likely that she traveled along with a group of women in 1523 to Mexico City to rejoin her husband, Alonso. During that voyage, Marina traveled along with her two youngest children, and her brother, Diego de Caballeria. The group arrived to Mexico City and rejoined Alonso. The city was mostly populated by natives, especially from the nations allied to Cort√©s. Marina surrounded her household with native women and learned basic Nahuatl in order to interact properly with merchants and neighbors. Her home soon became one of the centers of local social life. Widowhood In 1530 Alonso died. Marina was left to fend for herself and three unmarried daughters. According to Spanish law, a widow was to receive the same social status and courtesies as her deceased husband until she remarried. She was also the universal heir of her husband and administrator of her daughters' inheritance. She fought several litigations in court, both for control of her husband's assets and for the right to bury him in the manner she considered proper for his rank. Marina was also in charge of carrying her husband's last year as treasurer to term. The Spanish crown audited the accounting books of their secretaries yearly, in search of discrepancies or irregularities that needed punishment. In Alonso's absence it fell on his widow to provide explanations and reconcile the reports of all New Spain, which she successfully managed to do. Alonso's books turned out to have large amounts of missing money in them. Marina's properties in Ciudad Real were confiscated by the crown in reparation for the missing money, until she could repay it. For three years Marina wrangled with the Council of the Indies about a shipment of silver that Alonso had sent to his children in Spain. The argument was whether this money was personal or official, and therefore stolen. She also fought in court for the ownership of various encomiendas with so much insistence that Joanna of Castile personally intervened. She married her daughters to the most important people in Mexico. One of them she married close to the Mendoza family, powerful thanks to Antonio de Mendoza¬¥s influence, and no friends of Hernan Cortes, to help her pursue her claims. The other she married to the new treasurer. Marina also fought to receive all the recognition her husband used to enjoy. After several years she was granted an exception to the Spanish anti-slavery law and permission to own two slaves, a special privilege her husband and other first-line-conquerors had enjoyed.Robert Himmerich y Valencia \\"The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555\\" University of Texas Press Legacy Marina kept using this strategy of social influence, use of the legal system, and strategic marriages of her children to expand her influence and patrimony, while reporting poorness and economic misery in her letters to the king of Spain. By the end of her life Marina had accumulated one of the largest patrimonies and richest encomiendas of New Spain. Beyond her personal ambition, Marina's relentless energy was instrumental in returning order and stability to New Spain. She laid down the bases for social life, routines and social rites, and worked to establish a more organized trade, as well as to help the interaction between native noble allies and Spanish newcomers. She became a reference for new settlers, and worked hard to build a stable foundation for the daily workings of the city.Shirley Cushing Flint \\"No Mere Shadows: Faces of Widowhood in Early Colonial Mexico\\" University of New Mexico Press 2013 pp 13-37 References Category:Spanish emigrants to Mexico Category:16th-century Spanish women Category:Spanish conquistadors Category:Women in the Conquest of Mexico Category:Encomenderos Category:Conversos Category:1540 deaths ","title":"Marina de la Caballer√≠a"},{"id":"60096265","text":"Charanjeet Kaushal (born 3 August 1974 at Dehradun) is an Uttarakhand politician belongs to Indian National Congress.

Her \\"Brown Baby Plan\\" led to the adoption of 500 mixed race German orphans after World War II.  Early life  Grammer was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas to Pearl and Edward Treadwell. As a child she suffered from peritonitis, which ruptured her appendix. After she recovered, she found her illness left her infertile. She graduated from Ohio State University. During the 1940s she was a civil rights activist and wrote for the Washington Afro-American.  Germany  She married Oscar Grammer in 1950, and moved to Mannheim, Germany with him when he was stationed there by the United States military. While there, Grammer visited orphanages and learned that mixed German and African American children were not being adopted because of the stigma against mixed race children. She began adopting 12 children over the years that she lived in Germany. Grammer publicized the issue in the United States, writing regular announcements and articles in the Afro-American, a Baltimore newspaper, from 1951 to 1954. She encouraged African American families to adopt these German children, calling it the \\"Brown Baby Plan\\". She arranged for the adoption of German children into American families, working with so many German organizations that it is difficult to count how many children she helped. Working with the Refugee Relief Act, International Social Service, and American international adoption agencies generated a lot of red tape, so she acted as a private agency, simplifying the process for German orphanages and prospective parents. This also shielded parents from those at American adoption agencies who discriminated against African Americans. Her work was viewed very favorably by the German press, who called her \\"Mommie Mabel, the mother of the colored occupation babies\\". However, she was criticized by the German Child Welfare Office because she did not have a system in place or connections with American social welfare services to check up on the children after they were adopted. She was also criticized by American adoption agencies for the same reason. In 1965, her family returned to the United States and settled in Washington, D.C.. In 1968, Grammer received a humanitarian award from Pope Paul VI. Grammer died of hypertension on June 5, 2002.

The blending of definitions of motherhood and womanhood had been occurring in Spain long before this though, with a woman's role being defined as being in the house part of a biological determinism perspective supported by male run institutions in Spain, including the Government and the Catholic Church. The role of motherhood was debated when it came to women's education. Those on the left argued it was important for the emancipation of women, while those on the right argued it was important for preparing girls and young women in becoming mothers. Little changed during the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, except biological determinism became more prominent. The Second Spanish Republic allowed them to formally enter the public sphere en masse, while also seeing a number of rights available to women for the first time like the right to vote, divorce and access to higher education. Motherhood became more political, and in some circles gender non-conforming women and mother were met with increased hostility. Rights earned by women were viewed by Nationalists as a degeneration of Spain, which would result in the destruction of the Spanish family. Organizations were created to support traditional definitions of Spanish motherhood. Public violence against women and mothers defending striking workers also increased. The Spanish Civil War saw definitions of motherhood become more political, but still traditional in that womanhood was defined as motherhood. Life in rural areas for mothers could remain largely apolitical but it also saw the upset of the family structure in some places as houses emptied of men or those who remained had to be less traditionally masculine in order to survive. Gender roles were also broken as many women went to the front and many mothers needed to work outside the home to serve war efforts. The end of the war ushered in the period of Francoist Spain, and the return of motherhood defined around traditional Spanish Catholicism supported by a series of laws that made women wards of their fathers and husbands. Education for girls and women again focused on maintaining the home and becoming good mothers.  Definition of motherhood  The definition of motherhood in from the pre-Second Republic to the Francoist period is womanhood is motherhood, and motherhood was womanhood. This definition of motherhood as womanhood was rarely challenged, and would remain part of a Spanish status quo dating back to an earlier period of Catholic Spain.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800‚Äì1922)   Definition of motherhood  During the late 1800s, women and mothers were viewed by men as fragile creatures, subject to the whims of their body, and captive to illness and suffering centered around menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. According to male thought leaders in Spain, these illnesses necessitated women to remain at home and serve in their natural duty of procreation. Social order was defined around biological order expressed through sex differences. These beliefs were supported by male physicians inside Spain and around Europe. Motherhood was defined around biological determinism.  Education  The cultural situation in Spain resulted in a largely uneducated female population, with the literary rate for women only at 10% in 1900. The number of women known to have university titles in the period between 1800 and 1910 was around one, with Mar√≠a Goyri being the exception among Spanish women. This began to slowly change, with the literacy rate for women being 62% by 1930 and the gender ratio in schools being close to 50/50 on the primary school level. Motherhood would play an important role around education in Spain starting in the 1860s, as a debate began to emerge over what role education should play in the lives of women. Women's rights advocates, like Concepci√≥n Arenal who posed as a man to get a law degree in the 1860s, argued that women were just as smart as men. The only difference was that women lack access to education, and providing women with an education would open up opportunities for them outside the home. Emilia Pardo Baz√°n was another voice in this period advocating for increased access to education for women from a feminist perspective. She published her ideas in publications like London's Fortnightly Review and Spanish magazine Nuevo Teatro Cr√≠trico. On the other side, male leadership often argued for education for women as part of their goals of strengthening the state. They believed educating women in schools to become better wives and mothers would aid the state, by providing a backbone to support the next generation of male leaders.  Childbirth  The birthrate for women in Spain in the 1800s was 44 per thousand people. Midwives needed to be approved before being given a license. Women were sometimes confined to bed for a period of sometime after giving birth. Francisca Iracheta published the first book by a woman on midwifery in Spain in 1870. It used a question and answer style method to teach future midwives, and also contained illustrations of the pelvis. Infant mortality rates were very high in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and many children in Spain were born out of wedlock.  Organizations   Agrupaci√≥n de Trabajadores  Agrupaci√≥n de Trabajadores was created as a labor organization in 1891 by Teresa Claramunt to support her feminist ideals, and soon organized public meetings. The organization argued that women were being doubly punished by society, as women were expected to work outside the home to provide for the family while at the same time to meet all the domestic needs of the households. The organization was never particularly successful in its goals as many women in the workforce did not see a need for representation by a union.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)   Definition of motherhood  Maternidad y Feminismo was published in 1926 and written by Gregorio Mara√±on. A leading medical figure of the time, Mara√±on defined both genders in the book by their biological roles, using science to justify women's role as mothers as women where characters by an anabolic metabolism, which made them have a need to synthesize and accumulate things in a passive manner. The passive nature of an egg in the fertilization process and its need to nest in the uterus during pregnancy explained the need, according to Mara√±on, for women to maintain passive roles in the home taking care of children as a primary function. This definition was mirrored by Antonio Vallejo-N√°gera in his 1937 text, Eugenesia de la Hispanidad. He also argued that this definition was important for the continuation of the state.  Feminism  In the lead up to the founding of the Second Republic and the Civil War, many middle class and upper class women who became feminists did so as a result boarding school educations resulting in parents unable to guide the evolution of their political thoughts, fathers encouraging daughters towards political thinking, or being indoctrinated in classes essentially aimed at reinforcing societal gender norms. Left leaning families were more likely to see their ideas manifested by their daughters as feminists through active influence. Right leaning families were more likely to see their daughters become feminists through rigid gender norms resulting in a familial break.  Education  For many leading male figures in this period, the education of girls and women was not important in substance. What mattered was the content should be focused around preparing girls and women in serving their husbands and in becoming good mothers.  Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937)  leftOne of the most important things about the Second Republic for women is it allowed them to formally enter the public sphere en masse. The period also saw a number of rights available to women for the first time. This included the right to vote, divorce and access to higher education.  Elections in the Second Republic  \\"Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola\\" (1931) by painter Teodoro Andreu. The Spanish monarchy ended in 1931. Following this and the end of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic was formed. The Second Republic had three elections before being replaced by the Franco dictatorship. These elections were held in 1931, 1933 and 1936. A few on the right supported women's suffrage as they saw it as likely benefiting them, which it did in the sense of providing additional support in the 1933 elections that saw a right wing government come to power. This support was based around their idea of Spanish motherhood, where women were subservient to men, men were subservient to the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church could then influence election outcomes through the women's vote. This was indeed part of the reason some prominent women on the left, including Victoria Kent Siano and Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen, opposed women's suffrage.  February 1936 elections  During the elections, pamphlets were distributed in Seville that warned women that a leftist Republican victory would result in the government removing their children from their homes and the destruction of their families. Other pamphlets distributed by the right in the election warned that the left would turn businesses over to the common ownership of women.  Attitudes regarding non-conforming women  For the 1936 May Day celebrations, the Communist Party of Spain worked hard to convey a perception that they were one of the dominant political groups in the country by turning out party members in Madrid. They successfully organized hundred of Communist and Socialist women to participate in a march, where they chanted \\"Children yes, husbands no!\\" () with their fists clenched in the air behind huge Lenin and Stalin banners. This was particularly upsetting to male military members on the National right, including General Primo de Rivera who wrote about the incident in a letter. They saw it as women wrongly challenging Spain's traditional gender roles.  Women's rights  Legal equality for women was opposed by many on Spain's right. They saw it as a degeneration of Spain, which would result in the destruction of the Spanish family. This tension about the rights of women was part of their tension over the existence of the Republic, and one of the reason they were opposed to it.  Organizations   Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola  The comrades of Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange de Santa Marta. Photo by In√©s Cabellero de Le√≥n. 1936. Secci√≥n Femenina de la Falange Espa√±ola was founded in 1934. It was led by Pilar Primo de Rivera, sister of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, as an women's auxiliary organization of Falange. Fascist in the mold of Mussolini's Italian party, both organizations were misogynistic in their approach to the goals of building a revolutionary organic society that would support traditional Spanish values. There were three things they saw as critical to doing this: the family, the municipality and the syndicate. Using traditional gender roles from the Catholic Church, they would impose their values on women in the home. Given its goals of making women docile participants in civic life, the women's organization does not meet the definition of a feminist organization. It was the only major Nationalist women's political organization, with a membership of 300 in 1934. By 1939, Secci√≥n Femenina would eclipse the male run party in memberships, with over half a million women belonging to the group.  Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica de la Mujer  Women involved in Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica de la Mujer (ACM) were involved in challenges to the Second Republic's laws that prohibited Catholic ceremonies and civic activities, including religious processions through towns. They often defied these laws, and were at the front of processionals in order to insure they were allowed to practice their more conservative version of Catholicism. Mothers also continued to enroll their children in and support Catholic education in spite of government attempts to limit it. Despite these political activities, male leadership in the Catholic Church and broader right leaning society attempted to get the ACM to be less political during the Second Republic. They encouraged ACM leadership to focus more on doing charity work, and on assisting working-class families. To this end, conservative leaders successfully oversaw the merger of ACM with the Uni√≥n de Damada del Sagrado Coraz√≥n in 1934. The new organization was called the Confederaci√≥n de Mujeres Cat√≥lics de Espana (CMCE). As a successful consequence, membership numbers dropped from 118,000 in 1928 to 61,354 members. It also saw the resignation of the more politically active women leaders from the newly formed CMCE. The newly merged organization also encouraged women explicitly to be less political, and participate in at most one or two demonstrations a year.  Education  The Second Republic had a goal of educating women. This was viewed as a radical concept, and many reactionaries inside the Republic were opposed to it. Many others supported it, seeing education as a tool to allow women to pass along Republican values to their children.  Childbirth  The Second Republic saw for the first time the introduction of maternity care being offered by the government. Women were also given access to contraception for the first time. In the latter part of the Republic, women would also be given access to abortion during the first three months of their pregnancies. Divorce by mutual consent was allowed for the first time, and the law made no distinction between illegitimate and legitimate births. Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n played a critical role as a medical professional during the Second Republic in Madrid. She published Cartilla de Consejos a las Madres in December 1931. She set up Puente de Vallecas Medical Clinic in Madrid in May 1934. Focusing on improved sanitation at medical facilities and encouraging women to change their lifestyles during pregnancy, her worked helped result in a drop in infant deaths by 1936 across the city. Her work on infant mortality continued into the Civil War period.Rodrigo, Antonina. ‚ÄúAmparo Poch y Gasc√≥n: La Doctora Libre.‚Äù El Peri√≥dico, 15 Apr. 2018, www.elperiodico.com/es/mas-periodico/20180414/amparo-poch-gascon- doctora-libre-6750793.  Pre-war interactions with the Guardia Civil and Falange  La Rioja, home region to Arnedo near Logro√±o , where four women were killed in 1931. Near the end of 1931, workers at a shoe factor in the village of Arnedo near Logro√±o were fired because they were members of Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT). Villagers decided to protest their firing outside the townhall, and were fired upon for no discernible reason by the Guardia Civil. Four women, a child and a male worker were killed, while another thirty were injured. Falangists were seeking to engage in attacks that would provoke Republican reprisals in 1935 and 1939. One such attack occurred on 9 March 1936 in Granada during a strike by workers. A squad of Falangist loyalist fired on workers, and their families who were protesting with them. Among the wounded were many women and children. The left in the city immediately retaliated by calling for a general strike, and people in the city setting fire to the offices of Falange, Acci√≥n Popular, the offices of the newspaper Ideal and two churches.  October Revolution of 1934  Asturias, Spain. Women played roles behind the scenes in one of the first major conflicts of the Second Republic, when workers' militias seized control of the mines in Asturias. Originally planned as a nationwide strike, the workers collective action only really took place in Asturias. Some women were involved in propaganda and others in assisting the miners. After the government quelled the insurrection by bringing in Moroccan legionaries, some 30,000 people found themselves in prison and another 1,000 were put into graves. A large number of those put into prison were women. Women also played an advocacy role in trying to see their husbands and male relatives released. During the Austrian miners action, the government of the Second Republic responded by arresting thousands of miners and closing down their workers centers. Women rose up to support striking and imprisoned miners by advocating for their release and taking jobs to support their families. Partido Comunista de Espa√±a (PCE) male leadership strove to find roles for women that better comported with what they saw as more acceptable for their gender and better fit into the new, more conservative legal framework being created by the Second Republic. This included changing the name of the Committee for Women against War and Fascism to Pro-Working Class Children Committee. PCE's goal and the actual result was to discourage women's active participation in labor protests. During the Asturian conflict, there were a few instances of women initiated violence. This fed into paranoia among those on the right that women would violently try to seize power from men. Both on the left and the right, these women were not viewed as heroic, and men wanted to limit their potential for further political action. Women were also involved in building barricades, clothing repair, and street protests. For many women, this was the first time they were civically engaged without a male chaperone as in many cases, they were working on behalf of imprisoned male relatives.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  Spanish Civil War Memorial in its original location between the former Civic Centre and the Broad Street Mall in Reading, England depicting mother and dead child.  Definition of motherhood  Definitions of motherhood became explicitly political in this period. On the Republic side, the concept of \\"combative motherhood\\" began to develop, where motherhood was defined by a willingness to heroically their sons on behalf of Republican ideals, and mothers encouraging their sons to be willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of those ideals. Unlike Nationalist definitions of motherhood in this period, Republican definitions allowed women some autonomy outside that of their husbands or the fathers of their children. These Republican definitions were also aided by figures such as Dolores Ib√°rruri, who portrayed motherhood as similar to that of Mary and the Passion of Christ. These Republican definitions though continued to support a basic definition of womanhood as motherhood.  Role in the family  Mothers had a variety of different experiences during the Civil War depending on their personal situations. Many mothers in rural areas were apolitical, no matter what side of the front they lived on. They had little access to resources that would have allowed them to be politically engaged, and were often short on resources required for basic living. During the war, mothers worked hard to try to maintain a sense of normalcy. This included continuing domestic education, both among Republican and Nationalist women. Topics of focus included understanding the water, agriculture and religious education. Spanish sayings used by mothers at this time included, \\"After you eat, do not read a single letter.\\" Reading was not viewed as good for digestion. Children were also encouraged by their mothers in rural areas to take a siesta after a meal. Mothers would often engage in activities like slapping and hitting their children as a way of reinforcing social education. Songs played an important part of rural life for women, in that singing signaled a woman was happy. For mothers, songs served another important function of passing along social values to their children. Songs also passed along messages about gender roles, including the importance of outward appearance. During the war, many mothers went to great lengths to try to feed their children during periods of food shortages. They might sneak into other towns to try to get food rations when the ration in their town was too small. They might forgo eating themselves so their children could have bigger portions. For many mothers in rural areas, the idea of being politically engaged was not possible. They had too many things they had to do at home to have time for that. They had to make soap. They had to work in the fields because of national rationing. Most Spanish homes during the war lacked running water at home. Mothers had to acquire water from local wells, lakes or rivers. They had to wash clothing for the whole family, making a journey to a body of water to do that. They also had to be home to prepare food when it was available. Most homes at this time did not have modern kitchens, and mothers had to cook over open flames using hay and wood for heat. The war upset the social structure inside the family. Because of survival issues related to food and fear of political persecution, the skills of mother in acquiring and preparing food while also remaining politically invisible meant they began to take on the role of head of household. Silence became a virtue, because doing or saying the wrong thing could lead to death at the hands of Nationalist forces. Women were less likely to be harassed than men, which meant they were often more out of the home. This could create tensions behind closed doors, as it attacked traditional Spanish definitions of masculinity as it made the home the domain of the mother. This change of women being the boss of the home would continue after the Civil War for both Republican and Nationalist families. Republican mothers had to deal with conflicting definitions of motherhood, and an increasing realization that the Republican side would lose. They were left with few choices in how to deal with this. Some responded by trying to instill Republican values in their children with a belief that the Republic would return. Others responded by hiding their own Republican leanings and having their children avoid Republican related activities in order to avoid them facing consequences during a Francoist government.  Gender roles  The Spanish Civil War served to break traditional gender roles on the Republican side. It allowed women to fight openly on the battlefield, a rare occurrence in twentieth century European warfare. The war also served to remove the influence of the Catholic Church in defining gender roles on the Republican side. While the war broke down gender norms, it did not create an equitable employment change or remove the domestic tasks as the primary role of women. Behind the scene, away from the front, women serving in personal family and Republican opposition support roles were still expected to cook for soldiers, launder their uniforms, look after children and tend to dwellings. Women supporting CNT militants found themselves at once liberated from these gender roles, but still expected to serve male fighters in traditional roles. The most successful female political periods in this period survived by not challenging these gender norms and not threatening their male colleagues. Examples of such women include Dolores Ib√°rruri. This contrasted with figures like Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen whose gender presentation upset men.  Media depictions of women  Republican milicianas in training during the Spanish Civil War. Nationalist propaganda held help the image of the mujer castiza. She was modest, pure, asexual, self-sacrificing and traditional, supporting the Spanish family through work at home, She was the anti-thesis of the Republican fighter in that she was far away from the front, serving an important role as a mother and would never leave her family to be involved in combat. This contrasted with the imagery of Republican milicianas, who were sometimes depicted as mothers who went to the front to fight for their families.  Civilian women on the home front  Many poor, illiterate and unemployed women often found themselves immersed in the ideological battle of the Civil War and its connected violence as a result of forces beyond her control. Some of these women, mostly on the left, chose to try to reassert control by becoming active participants in the violent struggle going on around them. When it came to deciding who was right and wrong, many women had to use their own moral judgement formed by a lifetime to do so. They were not guided by political radicalization leading to ideological based morality. Women and children behind the lines were used by all sides, as a way of trying to garner support for their sides in the Civil War both internally and internationally. Nationalists often appealed to Catholics overseas, condemning Republican bombings on women in civil populations, claiming over 300,000 women and children had been killed. This met with limited success in the United States, where Catholics were uneasy with bombings against women and children that were being committed by both sides. In the Republican offensive against Nationalist held Teruel from December 1937 to February 1938, brigades on the ground tried to honor Indalecio Prieto's call to protect civilians, and particularly women and children. They sometimes stopped shelling buildings when people inside made clear they were non-combatant women and children. The reality of the offensive and life on the front lines meant many of those civilians had nothing. Women would often risk their lives to loot recently shelled buildings. They needed furniture to burn to melt snow for water, to cook and to provide some heat. Many women, on both sides in the city, died of starvation during the month long battle.  Nationalist women on the Nationalist homefront  Memorial plaque in left Falangist women activists were often divided into groups, which were largely based on age. Younger activists often to be outside the home, working on Nationalist goals in Nationalist women's organizations. Older women Nationalist activists believed they should be outside the public eye, serving Nationalist interests by working in the home. Nationalist women in more rural, less cosmopolitan cities, often had more privileges than their urban counterparts. They were able to leave the house, regardless of their marital status, and engage in the everyday tasks required for living. Few people noticed and cared. While Nationalist forces believed women should be at home, the realities of war meant that women were required to work outside the home, in factories and other businesses. During the war, Nationalist publications encouraged women to stay at home in service of the family. They were discouraged from shopping, going to the movies and engaging in other behavior viewed as frivolous by Nationalist male leaders.  Republican women behind Nationalist lines  A girl with her doll in 1938 after a bombing. Behind Nationalist lines, all women were forbidden from wearing pants. Instead, women were to wear skirts, which had to be long. Shirts were required to be long sleeved. Rape was so common that many pregnant women did not know who the fathers of their children were. Rape, along with murder and torture, were frequent tools used by Nationalist forces to instill terror in women and keep them in line. When Constantina was taken by Nationalist forces on 7 August, those forces sought revenge for anarchist shooting of Nationalist prisoners. Women who had found themselves widowed recently or who had husbands serving with the Legionaries were raped in a mass orgy event fueled by alcohol provided by local wineries. On 10 August, show trials were held and many women were given death sentences for things like displaying Republican flags, expressing admiration for President Roosevelt or criticizing their employers. Among the women executed were two pregnant girls. 20 women believed to be Republican sympathizers were removed from a maternity ward in Toledo and executed. The Nationalist soldiers then threw their bodies down a nearby well, and proceeded to parade through a local village with the dead women's underwear draped on their rifles.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)   Definition of motherhood  Following the end of the Second Republic, Francoist propaganda set about to eradicate beliefs that had arisen during the Second Republic that suggested womanhood had a definition of emancipation and was beyond that of biological motherhood. It strove to recast women and mothers as \\"Angels of the Hearth\\" who were courageous, modest, moral and self-sacrificing. Women were defined as a separate species, where sex definitions were based on being a natural species that exists purely to procreate. The fascist regime was supported by the Catholic Church and Secci√≥n Feminina, who all saw defining women as mothers as important for supporting the structures of the state. This definition of motherhood was then frozen, remaining until the end of the regime.  Identities as women and mothers  Overall, the end of the Civil War proved a double loss for Republican women, as it first took away the limited political power and newly won identities as women they had won during the Second Republic and it secondly forced them back into the confines of their homes. Life in exile dislocated some Republican mothers from their identities as mothers. While mothers, they created identities based around being political activists. Motherhood was not an identity some of them felt they could afford, as they saw greater importance in accomplishing political goals and their identities around that. Priorities changed after the war. For many women in rural Spain and many mothers living in pueblos, the repressive nature of the Civil War and women needing to take charge of the family in rural Spain led to feelings of solidarity among women. It led to mothers creating a form of female specific identity that had largely not existed in rural Spain prior to the war.  Role in the family  Motherhood became the primary social function of women in Francoist Spain. Still, this critical societal role it was one the regime only wanted to see perpetuated among those who shared in their political ideology. Children of mothers with leftist or Republican leanings were often removed from their care in order to prevent mothers from sharing their ideology with their offspring. A law passed on 30 March 1940 meant Republican women could keep their children with them in prison until the child turned three years old. At this point, children were then put into state care to prevent the contagion of Republican thinking from spreading. The number of children removed from Republican mothers between 1944 and 1954 was 30,960. These children were not allowed to remain in contact with their families, and many found themselves in centers run by Auxilio Social. When mothers were released from prisons, they were often watched to make sure they were good mothers as defined by the state. Actively surveiled, many women lost custody of new children they had. Because many women and mothers had husbands, sons and fathers in prison, Republican mothers in this period had their specific role of mother defined and organized around providing support for family members behind bars. It was expected of them, and these mothers often formed support groups among themselves and in aide of prisoners. The included getting books for prisoners, raise funds for prisoners, campaign for better treatment of prisoners, and campaign for their release. Republican mothers abroad addressed the problem of specifically being targeted by Franco's regime by created the Uni√≥n de Mujeres Espa√±oles (UME) in France. The purpose of the organization was to legitimize political activity of mothers as being part of the broader efforts of \\"female consciousness.\\" UME published a magazine called Mujeres Antifascistas Espa√±olas. The publication linked Republican women in exile with those in Spain, including some who were in prison. It honored women's roles as front line combatants, and suggested the special role of motherhood made their voices more valuable when it came to speaking out against the problems of the Franco regime. This contrasted to Spanish Communist women in exile beliefs, which suggested mothers in this period should fade into the background, serving in roles that supported single women and men who could be more visible in the struggle against Franco. Communists emphasized a traditional view of motherhood espoused by Franco.  Gender roles  The end of the Civil War, and the victory of fascist forces, saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain. This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military. Where gender roles were more flexible, it was often around employment issues where women felt an economic necessity to make their voices heard. It was also more acceptable for women to work outside the home, though the options were still limited to roles defined as more traditionally female. Women were still required to get permission from their husbands before outside the home. This included working as nurses, or in soup kitchens or orphanages. The Civil War proved a loss for many Republican women. For some women in Spain, the Francoist period represented a continuation of the Second Republic. Many never felt empowered during the Second Republic and Civil War, and because they were largely behind fronts that saw less disruption to the family structure, the family had never been become matriarchal with a mother running the home. This was particularly true in conservative parts of the Basque Country, where a patriarchal family structure with fixed gender roles of men as the head of household and women as subservient mothers continued into the Francoist period. With strict gender norms back in place, women who had found acceptable employment prior and during the Civil War found employment opportunities even more difficult in the post war period. Teachers who had worked for Republican schools often could not find employment. Gender norms were further reinforced by Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange. Opportunities to work, study or travel required taking classes on cooking, sewing, childcare and the role of women before they were granted. If women did not take or pass these classes, they were denied these opportunities.  Education  Falange party schools teaching girls focused on the home during the post war period. Girls in the first through third grades were instructed in tidiness of the home and their immediate environments. They were instructed in bringing harmony, balance and softness to their domain of the home. Other school lessons included ones on the virtue of silence or how to carry on audience appropriate conversations. Lessons also explained what was and what was not acceptable for women in the company of others for activities like laughing, sneezing and copying with pain. Such lessons would continue until the late 1950s.  Feminism  Isabel the Catholic in Alcala de Henares. Secci√≥n Femenina de Falange worked to depict feminism as a form of depravity. It associated feminism with drug abuse and other evils plaguing society. State supported feminism, expressed through Secci√≥n Femenina, offered Isabel the Catholic and Teresa of Avila as symbols for Spanish women to look up. They had first been used by Francoist women during the Civil War, and reminded women that their role was to become mothers and to engage in pious domesticity.  Women's rights  The pillars for a New Spain in the Franco era became national syndicalism and national Catholicism. Following the Civil War, the legal status for women in many cases reverted to that stipulated in the Napoleonic Code that had first been installed in Spanish law in 1889. In March 1938, Franco suppressed the laws regarding civil matrimony and divorce that had been enacted by the Second Republic. The post Civil War period saw the return of laws that effectively made wards of women. They were dependent on husbands, fathers and brothers to work outside the house. It was not until later labor shortages that laws around employment opportunities for women changed. These laws passed in 1958 and 1961 provided a very narrow opportunity, but an opportunity, for women to be engaged in non-domestic labor outside the household. The Franco period saw an extreme regression in the rights of women. The situation for women was more regressive than that of women in Nazi Germany under Hitler. Women needed permission to do an array of basic activities, including applying for a job, opening a bank account or going on a trip. The law during the Franco period allowed husbands to killed their wives if they caught them in the act of adultery. Mothers could only get state benefits if they were lawfully married and their children were legitimate.

Created in 1919 as a Carlist social aid organization for the poor, they went into decline during the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as there was less of a perceived need for promotion of their ideals. The Second Republic saw conservative women join and form women's groups in response to what they saw as an attack on their traditions and culture. Women went into homes, organizing musical evenings, religious actions and proselytizing. Organized by regions, the Narvarre group would become one of the biggest. Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor's prominence grew during this period, becoming the national face of the Margaritas. Despite men traditionally opposing political empowerment of women, Communi√≥n Tradicionalista supported the Margaritas to further their own political goals and so long as the Margaritas did not challenge male leadership. Despite a National policy that women should stay well away from the front and Carlists supporting traditional gender roles, Margaritas were very active on the front. They delivered mail, collected Nationalist corpses, laundered clothes, and taught men how to read. In more rural areas, they also took over agricultural activities. The end of the Civil War and the start of the Francoist period saw Carlism become illegal and the Margaritas disbanded, with official restrictions not being lifted until the mid-1940s. The important contributions of the women of the Margaritas would largely be forgotten and ignored even as the Carlist militia, the Requet√©s, enjoyed new popularity in the 1950s.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800‚Äì1922)  The Margaritas were founded in 1919 as a social aid organization for the poor. They came from a Carlist tradition, and were part of the Communi√≥n Tradicionalista party as women's auxiliary service organizations. Their youth movement counterparts were the Pelayos, and the Carlist militia was the Requet√©s. The Margaritas were named after Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma, wife of Carlos VII. Princess Margarita had served as a nurse during the Second Carlist War. The ordinance of the Margarita was to be \\"an example of Spanish woman, intrepid defender of the Christian family, vigilant guardian of the traditions of the patria.\\" Carlism supported Don Carlos of the Borb√≥n monarchy, and supported a form of traditionalist Catholicism alongside a strong, traditional Catholic monarch. They opposed King Alfonso XII during the nineteenth-century as they believed he led Spain into a much more liberal and secular direction. Leadership in the movement tended to come from the Spanish monarchy's court. Margarita had been called on before as a name to represent a group of Carlists. A faction of Carlist in √Ålava ran a slate of candidates under the name Los Margaritos in the 1910s provincial elections. Identifying with the Carlist princess, they wanted to offer a more authentic and simpler version of self-sacrificing Carlism. Carlism had become less important in Spanish politics following the end of the Second Carlist War. The movement would continue to lose influence going forward until the start of the Second Republic.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)  Historically, there had been few organizations for Carlist women. During the Dictatorship, the Margaritas were relatively quiet compared to earlier periods as there was less of a perceived need for them to serve in defense of the Spanish family. At the end of the Dictatorship in Navarre, Carlist women had only three options. One was Juntas de Damas Cat√≥lico-Mon√°rquicas, but it lack popular support nationally among Carlists. In Catalonia, the Margaritas ran a few work centers and neighborhood centers. There was a breakdown between Carlists and Sindicatos Libres starting around 1924. In Catalonia, this split meant the Carlism in the region no longer had to concern itself with trying to accommodate both Spanish nationalists and Catalan nationalists. In 1927, this allowed for the closure of the La Margarite Carlist work center in Barcelona. It was subsequently taken over by Sindicatos Libres's Severiano Mart√≠nez Anido and Civil Governor Milans del Bosch in 1931, which really upset Carlists. It also had the impact of making Sindicatos Libres completely isolated from other potential right wing partners in Barcelona.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)  The Second Republic saw an increase in the number of traditionalist women's organizations, and in Carlist women's groups, as this group felt a need to defend their Catholic beliefs and traditions. Their numbers were helped by women such as Dolores de Gort√°zar calling women to defend their views and become involved in that process. Carlists more broadly began using a mix of their traditional rallies and more modern political strategies to increase their political effectiveness and to avoid alienating people and minimize government scrutiny who feared another Carlist war.Blinkhorn, Martin.

Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor speaking, 1934 Some women in the Margaritas came from the women's section of Catholic Action. For many Margaritas, it was important to defend their religion and traditions. Their traditions revolved around creating an earthly version of the Holy Family. Fathers were in charge, and mothers were pious while their children were obedient. Pilar Careaga in 1932. One of the key organizational aspects among Margaritas in this period was local, with Margaritas asking that territorial boundaries be respected when it came to their work but also discussing the need for new organizational structures to be discussed. The largest group of Margaritas developed in Navarre, where they enjoyed political legitimacy that their male counterparts lacked. Women from the area included Dolores Baleztena, Carmen Villanueva, Clinia Caba√±as, Josefa Alegr√≠a, Isabel Baleztena, Ascensi√≥n Cano, and Rosa Erice. Pilar Careaga was the most active and visible Margarita from Valencia and Rosa Urraca from the Basque Country. After months of a Second Republic government dismantling institutions supporting and while challenging traditional values of Spain's right, Carlists began to become more politically relevant on the right. The Centro Tradicionalista Monta√±√©s held a conference in December 1931 where Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor spoke about the need to for women move from the church and to become actively engaged in the political struggle. The movement would soon see a number of female leaders emerge.\\"Elocuente conferencia de la se√±orita Pastor en Santander‚Äù, El Siglo Futuro, 30 December 1931, n¬∫ 17.296, p. 3, secci√≥n Movimiento Tradicionalista. Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor's prominence grew during this period, as she traveled around the country advocating her Catholic ideals and calling others to become more involved.‚ÄúElocuente conferencia de la se√±orita Pastor en Santander‚Äù, El Siglo Futuro, 30 December 1931, p. 3. In the 1933 elections she had ran for the Cortes from Gipuzkoa as Carlist representative in Uni√≥n Regionalista Gipuzcoana, but had narrowly lost and emerged bitter about the political process.she did not want to run, but was persuaded to, initially on Candidatura Cat√≥lico-Agraria de La Rioja, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72Andr√©s Prieto 2012, p. 70, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 215; having gained 31618 votes she missed 1702, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72taking place and concluded that ‚Äûla Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista me ha vendido por unas miserables pesetas Moral Roncal 2011, p. 216, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72 Still, she would become the most high-profile women in the Carlist movement since Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma. Urraca Paster was unique in this period in being one of the few Carlists concerned about the class struggle, with the topic coming up in many of her speeches and in her decision to directly speak to workers groups.‚ÄúVibrante acto de afirmaci√≥n tradicionalista. Discursos de Ana Ben√≠tez y Mar√≠a Rosa Pastor‚Äù, El Siglo Futuro, 28 October 1935, p. 20. During the Second Republic, Margaritas were involved in organizing Catholic schools as an alternative to government run public schools. Many more traditional Catholics removed their children from public schools and then enrolled them in Margaritas run ones. Socorro Blanco was created in 1933 by Margarias to support Carlist political prisoners. They sent postcards to prisoners and their families. They visited prisoners and their families, and organized for families to visit members in prison. They made public allegations of abuse inside prison. Carlist men had traditionally been opposed to women's political empowerment. They believed women should occupy a spot on the political margins. Changes in the Second Republic that allowed women to vote made male leaders start to slowly change their position starting around 1932, sensing a potential to gain political capital by having women as their more visible face. They wanted this to only happen though if Carlist women maintained their traditional values and put forth messages that also supported this. While being more visible, they did not want women to challenge their leadership.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  During the Civil War, many Catholic women were less willing to join Secci√≥n Femenina because it was less aristocratic. They also viewed them as more plebeian. This made them more hesitant to join them. As a result, these more middle-class women joined the Margaritas, where they had strong organizational skills, loyalty and a willingness to take on dangerous tasks in support of their beliefs and their hometowns. While Nationalists believed in traditional Spanish gender roles where women should be at home despite official National government policy saying this, their war efforts required many women to leave their houses and serve in a variety of roles such as nurses, social care workers and teachers. During the war, the Alfonso Carlos veterans' hospital published a one-page dedication to Margaritas, apologizing to them for requiring their services in masculine roles, saying in part, the \\"restless bees extract the richest honey of their labour ... accepting with resignation their roles as instructors, pharmacists, office workers and radiologists.\\" Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor went on the radio during the Civil War, encouraging women away from the front because a woman's real glory was in the role of mother and queen of her household. While requet√©s served bravely on the front, Margaritas were supposed to serve just as bravely in their homes and, through their hard work, shame men who had not gone to fight into heading to the front. During the early stages of the Spanish Civil War, many Margaritas were volunteers near the front, working as nurses, or in hospitals, workshops and canteens in support roles. They were highly trusted by military leadership. One of the most important contributions during the Civil War Margaritas was with Asistencia a Frentes y Hospitales organized by Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor. During the last winter of the Spanish Civil War, Margaritas were involved with distributing food to the troops. For the Navarre Margaritas of the Asistencia a Frentes y Hospitales, food took up the vast chunk of their budget in 1938 and 1939. The Navarre Margaritas provided 200,000 cans milk and jam to troops, along with hundreds of thousands of dulces and chocolates. They also provided alcohol and tobacco, occupying their third and fourth biggest food related expenses. This included 40,000 bottles of cognac, 4,600,000 cigarettes and 60,000 cigars. The Margaritas got a lot of financial support from the townpeople of Pamplona. During the Civil War, Margaritas operated their own postal service, providing daily mail to troops on the front lines near Somosierra and Guip√∫zcoa. Their postal service expanded as the front expanded during the war. They would sometimes use their postal service vehicles to follow requet√©s to the front, often returning with bodies of their fellow Carlists after delivering the mail. Before the end of the war, they would deliver 216,000 parcels to the front. Beyond mail, their postal service also provided militiamen with rosaries, crucifixes and Catholic medallions. Their final budget for the latter was 21,600 pesetas. Margaritas also supported the war efforts by working as seamstresses and launderers. They would often sew their slogan, \\"Detente bala\\" and burgundy crosses into uniforms they made for requet√©s. They would retrieve dirty clothes and uniforms from the front, mend them, launder them, disinfect them, and then return them within a week. They would return 116,000 bags of laundry to troops on the front by the end of the war. Margaritas served an important communications role for requet√©s, their families and towns they were from. They would provide updates on conditions of injured requet√©s to their family members and mayors of their towns. They would collect personal items from dead requet√©s on the front, deliver them to their family, and stay to provide comfort to the family of the dead. While incidents of Nationalist women being armed on the front were rare, Margarita Agustina Sim√≥n Sanz is one example of a woman who did. Caught up in the Republican assault on Belchite in August 1997, she fought the Republican forces surrounding her, attacking them with a pistol she acquired. She was captured by Republican forces, and subsequently executed alongside requet√©s she was with. Her story would subsequently be immortalized in a play based on her life performed in Pamplona on 8 November 1938 as part of Margarita fundraising efforts. Teaching was another task some Margaritas took up during the war, working alongside priests to teach illiterate soldiers on front how to read. Literacy classes were more beneficial in rural areas than urban, because literacy rates were much lower there. Many soldiers from these areas did not know how to write, and could not read or sign loan documents without using a thumbprint as a signature replacement. This was particularly the case in Ciudad Real. Margaritas often enjoyed these experiences. The impact of their teaching had the added goal of bringing Catholicism to parts of the country where it was much less practiced, including Asturias, Andalusia and the Canary Islands. In more rural areas depleted of men who left to fight for the Nationalists in the war, Margaritas often took over agricultural at home.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)  Factionalism following the end of the Civil War largely saw officially recognized Carlism political organizations fall to the wayside, and a period of limited official oppression started. The Francoist government began to relax these restrictions by the mid-1940s. In February 1947, forty-two members of the Junta of Regional and Provincial Chiefs met to talk about the future of Carlism and its structures. Among other decisions made at this meeting was the decision to restore the Margaritas. During the 1950s, the role of the Margaritas and their importance in providing support to those on the front was largely forgotten and erased, even as the Requet√©s enjoyed new popularity, with their male stories being told in newspapers like El Pensamiento Navarro. In ceremonies in Navarre commemorating Carlists in the Spanish Civil War, women were never on stage and were ignored by media except in background shots of those attending the festivities.

During the Civil War, POUM women served in many important roles including POUM governance, POUM militias, writing and publishing POUM-affiliated publications, and serving as teachers among the civilian population. Despite POUM having one of the smallest contingents of women among any leftist organizations, women played an important role in the organization's militias. POUM was unique in that it was the only organization that had not only accepted women but had provided them with weapons training. The group was eventually outlawed, and the May Days events of 1937 saw many POUM women imprisoned or forced into exile. POUM- affiliated women continued to be excluded after the Civil War. In exile, some POUM women were once again imprisoned. During World War II, the American Nancy MacDonald worked to assist Spanish POUM exiles and refugees in France and elsewhere around the globe.  Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937)   Founding  A plaque commemorating the location where POUM was founded on Calle Montserrat de Casanovas. The Second Republic formally came into existence on 14 April 1931. With it would come a number of rights for women, including the right to vote. Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista (POUM) was founded in September 1935. POUM came out as a result of the merger of Izquierda Comunista de Espa√±a (ICE) and Bloque Obrero y Campesino (BOC), representing Trotskyist factions in the anarchist and communist movements. It was led by Andreu Nin, Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n and Juan Andrade. It saw its greatest support in Catalonia, where BOC had already developed a large support organization. As dissenting communists, they would soon find themselves in conflict with the Communist Party of Spain, and CNT who saw them as potential rivals. Inside POUM, Federica Montseny quickly became the Anarchist counterpart to the Communist Stalinist Dolores Ib√°rrui.  Political activity  Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista was the dissident communist party during this late Second Republic and Civil War period. Their engagement for women involved trying to create specific female sub-organizations for them to join. They were primarily active in Catalonia. One of POUM's goals during the early part of the Second Republic was to give working-class women a feeling of empowerment. To do this, the Women's Secretariat set about organizing neighborhood women's committees to address day-to-day concerns of women living in specific areas. Known as the Women's Cultural Grouping in Barcelona, POUM's women's group also organized classes in Barcelona attracting hundreds of women participants. Classes focused on hygiene, knitting, sewing, reading books, children's welfare and discussing a broad range of topics including socialist priorities, women's rights, and the origin of religious and social identities. POUM's Women's Secretariat also trained women in cities like Barcelona in using weapons. They wanted women to feel prepared for the war that seemed inevitable. Women in POUM often had to deal with rank hypocrisy by revolutionary and leftist men, and men from POUM more specifically on the political and government side of the Second Republic and Civil War. While supporting reforms like divorce, gender-neutral clothing, and women's involvement on the front, these men would often have a wife back home and a mistress on the front, while also eschewing revolutionary apparel in favor of a suit and a tie. Even before the Communist purge in the government and in militias that peaked with the May Days in Barcelona in 1937, POUM's male leadership would advocate for women on the front, even as they encouraged women off it. Contacts took place in this period between POUM's Alfredo Mart√≠nez and leadership in Mujeres Libres in Madrid about possibly forming an alliance. These talks never went anywhere. Swiss journalist Clara Ensner, along with her companion Pavel Thalmaen, arrived in Barcelona in June 1936, shortly before the start of the war. They quickly became involved in journalism activities in support of POUM. Much later, they would controversially write about their experiences because of the many false statements found within them.  Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939)  POUM women served on the front, but were also engaged in many other important roles, including POUM governance, writing POUM-affiliated publications, and serving as teachers among the civilian population. POUM members in Madrid at times feared the domination of anarchists in Barcelona. This caused some internal conflicts within the group. They also had to deal fears of more bourgeois elements in society of the revolutionary nature of the Civil War, and what that would mean in the long term.V√≠ctor Alba and Stephen Schwartz, Spanish Marxism versus Soviet communism: a history of the P.O.U.M., , 1988 Katia Landau arrived in Spain from France, with the purpose of supporting POUM in the media against slanders by Stalinist Communists. The 1938 Les Stalinienes en Espagne pamphlet published in Paris was her most important contribution in this regard. Lois Orr served in the POUM female militia in Barcelona in the early part of the war.Lois Orr, Letters from Barcelona: An American Woman in Revolution and Civil War, edited by Gerd-Rainer Horn, , 2009Jeremy Harding, Paralysed by the Absence of Danger, London Review of Books, 31(18), 2009 Orr left POUM to work for the Catalan Regional Government Office of Propaganda. Mary Low organized a women's POUM militia. She also edited Spanish Revolution, an English language POUM newspaper. Soon after, Low fled to Cuba. Female Stalinists actively participated in POUM and Trotskyite purges in Barcelona. Women like Teresa P√†mies and Dolores Ib√°rruri intentionally excluded POUM- affiliated women even as they tried to build bridges with PSOE.Ib√°rruri, Dolores. Reply to the Enemies, Slanderers and Undecided. Marxists Internet Archive. P√†mies would also be responsible for isolating POUM's youth organization, Juventudes Comunistas Ib√©ricas, in such a way that it would leave blood on her hands. Teresa P√†mies' exclusion of POUM is notable as her cousins were part of the organization, and she considered them committed anti- Fascists. Ib√°rruri set out to destroy POUM. In June 1937, the Franco regime and the Communists in control of Republican areas both declared POUM illegal, leading to the dissolution of the group.  Women in Combat  Milicianas with their weapons during the Spanish Civil War. Of all the political groups on the Republican front, communist and anarchist columns attracted the most women. POUM attracted women fighters, but in smaller numbers. Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE) was one of the only major actors on the left to reject the idea of women participating in combat as it was too radical for them. They believed women should serve as heroes at home, providing support to civilian populations well behind the front lines. Those women members of PSOE who found their way to combat did so by joining communist, anarchist and socialist youth organized columns like those of POUM. Most of the women serving in front line roles had their positions defined by the communist, anarchist or POUM leadership, generally giving women equal roles when it came to combat, and providing the same military contribution. Combat experience did not significantly differ based on the political affiliation of the battalion that women in combat were attached to. POUM initially required both men and women in combat to engage in support roles as needed. Women were in the trenches and stood guard. Captain Fernando Saavedra of the Sargento V√°zquez Battalion said these women fought just like men. POUM had a column that included milicianas in the Mallorca campaign. POUM was the only organization that had accepted women and provided them with weapons training. The lack of weapons training by women in other militias would later be used as a reason to try to remove them from the front, even as those militias also failed to prove their male recruits with weapons training. Argentine-born transnational anarchist Mika Etchebehere served in a POUM militia during the Civil War. A self-described Trotskyist, Etchebehere moved to Madrid from Paris a few days before the outbreak of the War, enlisting immediately and then being deployed as part of the Hip√≥lito Etchebere column to the front near Madrid. By September, Etchebehere had become a commander after her own commander was lost in battle. Mika Feldman de Etcheb√©h√®re was among those at the Cathedral. She was one of the approximately one third of people who fled who survived. Her bravery during the Siege of Sig√ºenza earned her a promotion to POUM's Lenin Battalion Second Company Captain. After recovering from the siege in Barcelona, she was ordered to Moncloa, where she was in charge of a special shock troop brigade. Etchebehere survived the Civil War, hiding in Spain for several months following its conclusion before sneaking over the border and into France. POUM milicianas in Madrid during the siege in March 1937 were prohibited from taking up arms by the Communist-organized La Pasionaria column. These women were instead required to cook and do laundry for men serving on the Madrid front. After women were told to leave the front in March 1937, feminists in PSUC and POUM responded by changing their messaging, either suggesting women should be deployed on the home front or that women had a different role to play than men during times of war.  May Days of 1937  In the lead up to the May Days events, Communists aligned with the Soviet Union had largely taken control of the ports, where most of the support materials and relief aid coming in for distribution around the country were from the Soviet Union. They soon became a de facto police force, and were already working to undermine anarchists.\\"Rescuing Memory: the Humanist Interview with Noam Chomsky\\" The Humanist TheHumanist.com N. p., 2016. Web. 30 June 2016. On 1 May 1937, thousands of armed anarchists took to the streets, daring the government and police to disarm them. Open conflict started on 3 May in front of the Telef√≥nica building. On 4 May, the city had come to a complete work stoppage, with machine guns appearing in placements along the major streets in the city. By the conclusion of major fighting on 8 May, over 1,000 people had died and another 1,500 were wounded.How the NKVD framed the POUM. What Next? Marxist Discussion Journal. The POUM leadership saw it all come to a tragic head on 16 June 1937 when Andr√©s Nin and the POUM executive were arrested. The next day, foreign POUM members and supporters were arrested en masse at the Hotel Falcon and taken to prison. Eventually, many foreigners in the group were rescued, thanks in part to the journalist George Tioli. Informed of their imprisonment by Tioli, the US Consulate worked to secure the release of Cusick and Orr. The May Days events involved a number of POUM affiliated women. Nurse Teresa Rebull was among them. Her involvement led to punishment, which was part of the reason she subsequently fled Spain. Lois Orr was also involved in the Barcelona May Days. Lois Cusick was caught up in the May Day events. Cusick and her companion's apartment at Avinguda Republica d'Argentina 2 was raided and the pair were arrested along with other POUM foreigners in the area like Katia Landau. The raid was conducted by a Russian and three plainclothes policemen affiliated with the guardias de asalto. As night fell, they were marched through the blacked out streets of Barcelona to Portal de l'Angel, 24. Eventually they were rescued in part because of the actions of the journalist George Tioli. With assistance from the United States Consul Mahlon Perkins, informed of the imprisonment thanks to Tioli, her group, which included Orr, Cusick and Landau, was released on 1 July. Two days later, they departed Spain aboard a ship bound for France.  Francoist Spain (1938 - 1973)  In the immediate postwar period, the Second World Youth Peace Conference was held at Vassar College in the United States in 1938. While most of the leftist factions of Spain were represented, POUM was deliberately excluded following efforts to isolate and dismantle them by Stalinist Communists during the May Days events. A number of women had been imprisoned for a second time as a result of lingering distrust and active persecution of communists and anarchists in France during World War II. Their first prison sentences had often been in Spanish prisons, jailed by either Nationalist forces or Communists. Following the end of the Civil War, during World War II, American Nancy MacDonald worked to assist Spanish POUM exiles and refugees in France and elsewhere around the globe. She created the organization Spanish Refugee Aid, which served as a larger umbrella organization to coordinate efforts with anti-Stalinist groups to assist former POUM members. During the later parts of the war and at its conclusion, some women from POUM were coerced into making false confessions in Moscow courtrooms, and then sent to Soviet prisons. Their major crime was being Trotskyites. It was only during the 1950s and 1960s that some of those women involved with POUM and Trotskyite purges began to re-evaluate their role in them; their change of heart occurred only after Stalinist Communism lost its prestige among leftist circles.

He established China's first laboratory for radiation toxicology, and is considered a founder of radiation toxicology and radiation protection studies in the country. He was a professor and president of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and served as president of the China Toxicology Society, deputy representative of China to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and as a committee member of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1995.  Life and career  Wu was born in Beijing, Republic of China on 22 October 1927, with his ancestral home in Wujin, Jiangsu. After graduating from Peking University in 1949 with a degree in chemistry, he taught as an assistant professor and later lecturer at Peking Union Medical College. In 1956, Wu was selected by the Ministry of Health to study in the Soviet Union for a year. After returning to China, he taught at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS) as an associate professor. He was later promoted to professor, Chair of the Department of Toxicology, Dean of the AMMS Institute of Radiation Medicine, and eventually President of AMMS. Outside of the AMMS, Wu served as President of the China Toxicology Society, China's deputy representative to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), and as a member of Committee 1 (Radiation Effects) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). On 10 May 2018, Wu died at the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing, at the age of 90.  Contributions  Wu established China's first laboratory for radiation toxicology. He demonstrated the contamination patterns and hazards of nuclear fallouts and proposed corresponding measures of protection. In the 1970s, he studied the toxicology of plutonium and discovered the mechanism of carcinogenesis in the lung cells and the lymph nodes. In 1976, a failed Chinese nuclear test caused large-scale plutonium contamination at the test site. Wu, who was in charge of training medical personnel to prepare for a potential fallout, managed the emergency response after the accident to protect the health of the workers. In the 1980s, he oversaw a systematic study of the emergency medical response to the accident, which won the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award. He was later involved in designing radiation protection measures at the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants. From the 1990s, Wu studied the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis by alpha particle radiation. He published more than 210 scientific papers and 7 books.

He died at only 24 years of age, soon after returning from his African trip, having collected a large number of natural history specimens including over 2000 insects. He was the eldest son of Per Henric Victorin (1790‚Äì1857), an industrialist from Kvarns Bruk, and his cousin 'Hedda' Hedvig Lovisa Westring (1804‚Äì1864), the daughter of Johan Petter Westring, physician to Karl XIV Johan of Sweden. Johan Fredrik's siblings were Carl Henrik Victorin, Eric Gabriel Victorin, Axel Rickard Victorin, August Christoffer Victorin, Ture Otto Victorin and Per Arvid Victorin. Johan Fredrik was first home-schooled by his father before attending a primary school in Link√∂ping in 1844 and then a high school in 1847. He proved to have a sharp mind and excellent memory, with a talent for drawing and painting. Natural history, and in particular vertebrate zoology, soon captured his interest. In the autumn of 1851 he enrolled at Uppsala University, studying natural history and mathematics. Throughout the summer of 1852 he studied the birds on the island of √ñland. Victorin suffered chronic tuberculosis, which eventually led to his death, and in an effort to convalesce he left for the Cape of Good Hope. Docking in Cape Town on 11 November 1853 he set about collecting in the vicinity. He happened to meet fellow naturalist Johan August Wahlberg, who advised him to extend his travels to the eastern parts of the Cape. On 27 February 1854 he sailed to Mossel Bay and then overland to George and Knysna. He stayed there until 1 December, finding a rich collecting ground in the forests. He became acquainted with members of the George Rex family, travelled to Plettenberg Bay, with excursions to Westford and Redburn. Returning to George he crossed over Montagu Pass into the Little Karoo, staying on the farms Roodeval (now Van Wykskraal) and Zeekoegat, near Oudtshoorn, until February 1855. His health declined over this period. He visited to the Cango Caves on 8 February, sailing for Cape Town from Mossel Bay on 9 March. Nine days later he sailed for Sweden and settled in Qvarn, where he died later that year. Victorin's collection from the Cape included 83 mammals (of 30 species), 517 birds (153 species), and 20 amphibians (14 species). The birds he prepared and preserved by himself. He also collected 31 bird's eggs (11 species), some 2000 insects, several shells and other invertebrates, plants, seeds, bulbs, and lichens. Two mammals and two birds from his collection were new to science. Generally his specimens were well prepared and his descriptions meticulous. Most of his collection was housed in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences which became the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Most of his insects were Coleoptera; his Hemiptera and Orthoptera were described by Carl St√•l (1856, 1871) and the Diptera by Hermann Loew (1858, 1860, 1862). The hemipteroid Pentatoma victorini was named after the collector. Victorin's notes on his collections at the Cape were edited by J.W. Grill and published as \\"Zoologiska Anteckningar\\" in the \\"Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science\\". Two new bird descriptions by Carl Jakob Sundevall were included in this paper and one of them was named Bradypterus victorini (now Cryptillas victorini, Victorin's Warbler). Grill also published a book in 1863 compiled from Victorin's letters and diaries, \\"J.F.

The issuance of fatwa garnered substantial controversy and scholarly attention. The fatwa addressed the reformist trend of Islam which had been popular among the broad Indonesian society over the past 25 years.Gillespie 2007, p. 206. Such trends advocated for a more substantive reading of the Quran and Hadith, instead of literalist approaches taken by the majority of ulamas (Islamic clerics). MUI considered such ideas as incompatible with Islamic teaching, releasing the fatwa to promote a more literal reading of the Islamic scriptures. The fatwa was heavily criticized by progressive Muslim intellectuals. Background Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) was established in 1975 by the Suharto regime, aimed at monopolization of the Islamic orthodoxy in Indonesia at the direction of the government.Gillespie 2007, p. 207. After the fall of Suharto in 1998 and the beginning of reformasi era, MUI was pressed to reformulate its role within the society. Initially, MUI aligned with B. J. Habibie who was deemed to be more friendly toward the political demand of puritanical Muslims. Habibie withdrew from the 1999 election, and Abdurrahman Wahid, a progressive figure, was elected as president from 1991 to 2001. Through the course, MUI lost its pipe with the government, prompted them to be an independent organization.Nur Ichwan 2013, pp. 65-68. They sought to establish its position as a religious authority representing the Muslim society. Suharto, during his rule, heavily suppressed the political Islamic movements and forced them to align with the state ideology of Pancasila. During this time, liberal and progressive interpretations of Islam gained societal traction. This includes neo- modernism, a derivation of reformist Islamic modernism which inclined toward more substantive reading of the Islamic scripture.Barton, 1997.Gillespie 2007, pp. 236-239. The substantive reading was justified as accommodating the societal reality of Indonesia as a religiously plural and secular state. Abdurrahman Wahid, then chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, was among the proponents of such ideas. The ideas were controversial especially among the ulamas, and puritanical organizations such as Indonesian Islamic Dawah Council (DDII) had been consistently criticizing them.Nur Ichwan 2013, pp. 80-83. After the collapse of Suharto regime, the substantive interpretations of Islam were succeeded by Liberal Islam Network (JIL) founded in 2001 by Ulil Abshar Abdalla among others. JIL was highly controversial due to Ulil's critical and contextual approach toward Sunnah (traditions and customs). There was also an ascendance of Islamist movements after the democratic transition, formerly suppressed by the Suharto regime. Notable organizations include Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), and Indonesian Mujahedeen Council (MMI). These organizations, in addition to DDII, were also staunch critics of the neo-modernist strand as well as JIL and Ulil. MUI, in order to bolster its position as a religious authority, issued eleven fatwas in 2005, incorporating the demands by the puritanical and Islamist bloc of the Muslim society. Among them was a fatwa against Ahmadiyya, a heretic and minority Islamic group, as well as the fatwa against religious pluralism, liberalism, secularlism, often collectively called SiPiLis.Van Bruinessen 2013. Content Fatwas by MUI consist of three sections; 'consideration', 'reminder', and 'clarification'. 'Consideration' section of the fatwa addresses the background of the issuance. 'Reminder' section provides the Quranic and Hadith accounts to justify the fatwa. 'Clarification' section makes up the core of the fatwa, divided into public and legal certainty sections. 'Public certainty' section delineates definition of concepts brought up in the fatwa. 'Legal certainty' section gives rulings that advised to be prescribed.Gillespie 2007, pp. 218-223. Piers Gillespie of the Australian National University translates the 'consideration' section as follows: > (a) Recently there has been a growth of religious pluralism, liberalism and > secularism which has been understood in a variety of ways in the community; > (b) This growth of religious pluralism, liberalism and religious secularism > within the society has created an uneasiness and a concern to the extent > that part of the community has asked the MUI to give some clarification by > means of a fatwa in relation to this problem; (c) Therefore, the MUI feel > that it is necessary to formulate a fatwa about the understanding of > pluralism, liberalism and religious secularism in order for it to provide > guidance to the Islamic community. He analyses that the (b) section facilitates the MUI's position as a representative of the Muslim society. Overall, the section sets the debate by considering reformist thoughts as problematic. On the 'reminder' section, several Quranic verses and Hadith accounts are cited. Among them, Al Imran verse 19 and 85 are cited to assure the existence of only one valid interpretation of Islam. Al-An'am verse 116 is cited to warn against the majority of people who believe in liberal interpretations of Islam. Al-Kafirun verse 6 is also cited to clarify that the fatwa is not directed against other religious groups. There are overall eight Quranic verses as well as three Hadith records being used in the fatwa.Majelis Ulama Indonesia 2005. 'Clarification' section consists of public and legal certainty sections. 'Public certainty' section defines four concepts that are being used in the fatwa, namely religious pluralism, religious liberalism as well as religious secularism. Notably, the idea of religious pluralism and religious plurality are considered separate. Accordingly, the former is an ideology that relativizes all religions. The latter is a condition that different religions live side by side. Religious liberalism is an interpretation dictated by independent thinking. Religious secularism is an idea to demarcate religion into the private realm. Based on these definitions, on 'legal certainty' section, the fatwa declares religious pluralism, religious liberalism as well as religious secularism as contradictory with Islam. It also commands Muslims not to follow these thoughts. The fatwa states that regarding the issue of aqeedah (creed) and ibadah (worshipping), Islam needs to be exclusive. Accordingly, on the issues not related to aqeedah or ibadah, Muslims can interact with non-Muslims in a way to sustain the religious plurality. Response ;Criticism The fatwa brought a fierce backlash by progressive Muslim intellectuals as well as traditionalist ulamas. Notable critics include Abdurrahman Wahid and Hasyim Wahid of Nahdlatul Ulama, Ulil Abshar Abdalla of JIL, Azyumardi Azra of the Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta, Djohan Effendi of the International Centre for Religious Pluralism, M. Syafi'i Anwar of the International Center For Islam and Pluralism, as well as Dawam Rahardjo of the Institution of Religious and Philosophical Studies (LSAF). The board of Nahdlatul Ulama also immediately made a statement to defend both pluralism and secularism of the Indonesian state. The contentions are predominantly centered on the vague definition of pluralism, liberalism, and secularism set by MUI. From the religious perspective, critics questioned the methodology of ijtihad (independent reasoning) employed by MUI, and veracity of which categorizing all liberal Muslims who follow the Five Pillars of Islam as deviant. From the non-religious perspective, the fatwa was criticized as a violation of religious freedom as well as a breaching of freedom of expression.Gillespie 2007, pp. 223-231. ;Defense Din Syamsuddin, former chairman of Muhammadiyah who served the general secretary of MUI since 2000, as well as several authors including Adian Husaini and Abdusshomad Buchori responded to critics by reiterating the definition as valid. Syamsuddin responded to Rahardjo, who was among the progressive wing of Muhammadiyah, by expelling him from the organization. Syamsuddin's role as MUI spokesperson received criticism from some Muhammadiyah members. ;Impact The fatwa prompted Islamic preachers to avoid usage of the term 'pluralism' during a conversation about interfaith relations. Anti-pluralism speech has been widely made since then, especially in mosques as well as religious magazines with puritanical inclinations. Martin van Bruinessen of Utrecht University marks the fatwa among incidents that catalyze \\"conservative turn\\" of the Muslim society in Indonesia.

The practice relates to the tradition of oral storytelling and has been described as reaching a peak in the Victorian era before the development of broadcast entertainment. Origins and function The party piece relates to the tradition of oral storytelling but has literary connections. Berners Jackson writes that the party piece had a \\"long and honourable career in the English- speaking world rising to its height, perhaps, under [Queen] Victoria\\". Adding that there are many instances in the diary of Samuel Pepys and even speculating that William Shakespeare had a party piece that he performed for the entertainment of his fellows when he was a boy.Jackson, B.A.W. (1962) Stratford Papers on Shakespeare. W. J. Gage. pp. 58‚Äì60. Alan Warren Friedman has defined the party piece as follows: > \\"Party pieces\\" are a peculiar kind of public self-representation. Neither > formal recitals within a prepared program nor wholly spontaneous (like > bursting into a drunken song), \\"party pieces\\" are something in between. > Performed at festive gatherings to entertain the assembled group temporarily > configuring itself as an audience, they are intended to create an atmosphere > of conviviality, fulfill social expectations or requirements, and express or > repay hospitality within a reciprocal economy in which host and guest may > perform welcoming and after-dinner speeches.

The need to perform a party piece may occur at a seasonal holiday such as Christmas or New Year when family and friends are gathered and there is an expectation that everyone will contribute what they can to the entertainment. In December 1949, The Times wrote of the burden felt by children obliged to learn something by heart or of the adult who felt that he or she had little to offer, not being able to perform a card trick, bend a poker in half, or tear a telephone directory in two.\\"Party Piece\\", The Times, 13 December 1949, p. 5. In 2019, Rob Rawson wrote that although sometimes considered outdated, party pieces may provide opportunities for hidden talents to be revealed. Examples In 1717, the actor and playwright Colley Cibber wrote The Nonjuror as a party piece for King George II who paid Cibber ¬£2,000 and appointed him poet laureate as a result. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge's party piece was the recitation of his poem \\"Christabel\\" which he performed for others many times before it was published in 1816.\\"Coleridge's Literary Influence\\" by Seamus Perry in In the twentieth-century, the novelist D. H. Lawrence was said to recite the poetry of Swinburne as his party piece. Alan Friedman has described the special place of the party piece in Irish literary culture in his book that explored their role in the output of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. In 2004, the Scottish broadcaster Sally Magnusson described a traditional Hogmanay in her family at which party pieces were performed that included the songs of Flanders and Swann, a rendition of the folk song \\"Sisters\\", an Australian medley by visitors from that country, and \\"an actor friend doing his Hamlet-in-three-minutes monologue\\".

Etiology Splenomegaly Splenomegaly can result in hematologic disturbances and abdominal pain and can increase the risk for splenic rupture, which also causes spleen pain, from blunt trauma, resulting in life-threatening internal bleeding. Many conditions can cause splenomegaly, such as various infections, liver disease, and cancer. Splenic infarction Abdominal pain remains the leading chief complaint in patients diagnosed with a splenic infarct. Evaluation of patients who present with abdominal pain requires a broad differential approach. Lab evaluation may help rule in other causes of abdominal pain. Elevated liver function tests, bilirubin or lipase, may suggest a hepatobiliary or pancreatic source for pain. Leukocytosis and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be found in splenic infarction. However, these results lack specificity to splenic infarct. Radiographic testing is required to detect this rare illness. In the hyperacute phase of infarction, abdominal CT scan performed with intravenous contrast is the imaging modality of choice in suspected splenic infarction. Splenic infarct appears as a wedge-shaped area of splenic tissue with the apex pointed toward the helium and the base of the splenic capsule. As the infarction matures, the affected tissue may normalize, liquefy or become contracted or scarred. Abdominal ultrasound has also been used to detect splenic infarction. Ultrasound findings of the hypoechoic wedge-shaped region of splenic tissue indicate infarction. Evolution of infarction may appear as hyperechoic with retraction of the splenic capsule. Splenic abscess Fever is the most common symptom of splenic abscess, followed by abdominal pain and a tender mass on palpation of the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The common signs and symptoms described of a splenic abscess include the triad of fever, left upper quadrant tenderness, and leukocytosis is present only in one-third of the cases. Splenic rupture Trauma is the most common mechanism of splenic rupture, and blunt trauma involving the left-upper quadrant, left rib cage, or left flank should raise suspicion for splenic involvement. The absence of substantial trauma cannot exclude the possibility of splenic injury, as individuals with a history of splenomegaly require less force for traumatic rupture. Severally ill patients may present with hypovolemic shock manifesting as tachycardia, hypotension, and pallor. Other findings include tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant, generalized peritonitis, or referred pain to the left shoulder (Kehr sign). Kehr sign is a rare finding and should increase the suspicion of the peritoneal process and possible splenic rupture. Some patients also report pleuritic left-sided chest pain in the setting of a ruptured spleen. Caution should be used early in the evaluation of patients with a concerning mechanism of injury, since few symptoms may be present early in the course of splenic rupture. It is important to ask focused questions regarding previous surgical history, hepatic disease process, recent infections, anticoagulant, aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs usage and bleeding disorders. Visual inspection for signs of external trauma such as abrasions, lacerations, contusions, and classic seatbelt sign on the abdomen is helpful. The absence of external visual findings does not exclude intra-abdominal pathology, as up to 20% of patients with intra-abdominal injury may not display these findings upon initial examination. Also, examination on arrival may not reveal severe tenderness, rigidity, or abdominal distention in spite of rupture. Physical examination may also be limited in a patient with altered mental status or distracting injuries. Therefore, the physical exam alone is not always sensitive when evaluating a patient with a splenic rupture.

It has been in the Rijksmuseum since 2000. The sitter was identified in 2000 by Eveline Sint Nicolaas as Kees Pop, a KNIL soldier from Africa. Such men were recruited during the period 1831-1872 as Zwarte Hollanders in Elmina and given names that were pronounceable for their military superiors.SK-A-4954 painting record in the Rijksmuseum2018 blogpost by Esther Schreuder about this painting and the work done by Sint Nicolaas ‚ÄòPop‚Äô was possibly from Elmina, but could have been born as far north as Burkina Faso or as far East as Nigeria. He served 12 years in the Aceh War. Under his mitella the medals for the Expedition Cross and the Aceh Medal can be seen. His colleague Jan Kooi was portrayed in the same year by J.C. Leich in a much more heroic, realistic military fashion, whereas Israels was much more interested in the drama of the sitter's personal story. This portrait shows the effects of a long military career in a foreign country surrounded by African comrades who themselves spoke different languages, answering to a name from a foreign language. Isra√´ls had a fascination for Dutch East Indies, possibly fostered by his friendship with the Dutch painter Johannes Evert Hendrik Akkeringa, who was of mixed Indonesian heritage. Though the first World War caused him to delay, Isra√´ls did manage to visit Dutch East Indies himself, where he made many paintings during the course of a two-year stay in 1921, armed with introductory letters from Akkeringa. Legacy This portrait, along with the portrait of Jan Kooi, were featured in the 2008 art exhibition in the Amsterdam Nieuwe Kerk called \\"Black is Beautiful\\", and sparked a national conversation about the \\"Indo- African\\" community that nearly a century later arrived in the Netherlands from Indonesia after WWII and some of whose members were possible descendants of these men.

Despite the vessel's loss, the \\"gallant and desperate\\" defense of her crew against a superior force of the Royal Navy and the Corps of Royal Marines is commemorated by the United States Coast Guard. Along with the Royal Navy frigate which bested her in battle, HMS Narcissus, Surveyor is among six legendary ships memorialized in the lyrics of the Coast Guard march \\"Semper Paratus\\". Construction USRC Surveyor was laid down in 1807 and commissioned the same year. Her home port was Baltimore, Maryland. The ship measured on deck, had a beam, and carried a normal complement of 25. She was armed with six-pound cannon. War of 1812 Early war By the War of 1812, Surveyor had become ‚Äì according to one period account ‚Äì \\"an old vessel hardly worth repairing\\". Still, under the command of Captain Samuel Travis, on 1 July 1812 she engaged and captured a British brig off the coast of Jamaica. \\"The gallant and desperate\\" defense of Surveyor The following year, on the evening of 1 June 1813 and while anchored in Chesapeake Bay, Surveyor was attacked by a Royal Navy boarding party of approximately 65 sailors and marines operating from the frigate HMS Narcissus which had entered the bay under cover of darkness. Closing on Surveyor in small boats with muffled oars to conceal their approach, British forces navigated away from the cutter's six-pound deck guns and boarded the ship. A fierce effort by Surveyor's crew to repel Royal Navy and Royal Marine boarders followed, described by British Lt John Crerie as one in which \\"her deck was disputed inch-by-inch\\" in a \\"gallant and desperate\\" defense. During the engagement, Royal Marine Captain Thomas Ford was mortally wounded by Travis in a cutlass duel. Nonetheless, outnumbered more than two-to-one, Travis ultimately ordered the ship's surrender. In tribute to the ferocity of Surveyor's resistance, Travis' sword was returned to him by Crerie and he was paroled at Washington, North Carolina, on August 7, 1813, with the remainder of the crew transferred to a British prison camp in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later history Following her capture, Surveyor was re-flagged for Royal Navy use, but was no longer in service by 1814.J. J. Colledge and Ben Warlow (2010).

It depicts Surveyor with her boarding net raised and her crew armed at the rails as four Royal Navy small boats converge on the ship. On June 15, 2014, the defense and capture of the Surveyor was reenacted at the Watermen's Museum in Yorktown, Virginia.

Up to 30% of these children may develop SSC with a mortality rate of up to 15%. This crisis occurs when splenic vaso-occlusion causes a large percentage of total blood volume to become trapped within the spleen. Clinical signs include severe, rapid drop in hemoglobin leading to hypovolemic shock and death. Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia experience multiple splenic infarcts, resulting in splenic fibrosis and scarring. Over time, this leads to a small, auto infarcted spleen typically by the time patients reach adulthood. Splenic sequestration crisis can only occur in functioning spleens which may be why this crisis is rarely seen in adults. However, late adolescent or adult patients in this group who maintain splenic function may develop splenic sequestration crisis.

Although not fabulously rich, she was wealthy enough to move to and fro between The Gilded Age in America and La Belle √âpoque in Europe. Inspired by Robert Browning's verse, she published a volume of poetry which was well received at the time but which eventually became almost forgotten. She married into the English aristocracy to Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice until she was able to get the marriage annulled after a few years. After the end of her marriage, as a single woman she travelled widely in Europe becoming friendly with such luminaries as Henry James and Sir Frederic Kenyon. She had romantic relationships with two men, both at the start of their professional careers, who were neither particularly wealthy nor who moved in high society. In 1901 she married the Italian physician, academic, explorer and mountaineer Filippo De Filippi. Together they toured Central Asia and India. Their happy marriage was cut short by her death in 1911 at the age of forty-six. Her biography, published in 2018, points out the parallels between her life and that of several of the female protagonists in the earlier novels of a writer she knew well, Henry James, exemplified by Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady. Early years Caroline Fitzgerald was born on September 22, 1865 in Litchfield, Connecticut to William John Fitzgerald and Mary Ann White. Her father had been born in 1819, also in Litchfield, coming from a well-connected family of Irish descent. He attended Upper Canada College, later took a law degree at Trinity College, Dublin and then practised law in Toronto. Her mother's father was Eli White, a wealthy New York merchant. Caroline had two brothers: the elder, Augustine (known as Austin), was born in New York in April 1862, went to Yale and became a landscape painter. Her younger brother, Edward, was born in Litchfield on May 10, 1871, went to Trinity College Cambridge, became a mountaineer and joined the army. As a young woman Caroline was well known in New York literary society; she was a classics scholar and one of the first women to study Sanskrit. She went to Europe with her family for about eighteen months in 1876 and then returned to America to live on the island of Mount Desert, Maine. She recorded in her diary that she wrote her first piece of poetry in 1881. Between 1881 and 1882 the family moved between both continents spending some time in Switzerland. In 1883 they lived in London and then Geneva in 1884. Portrait by Edward Burne-Jones,1884 Piero di Cosimo's Maria Maddalena In 1884 Edward Burne-Jones painted her portrait and it was exhibited in the New Gallery in London. According to her biographer, Gottardo Pallastrelli, she appears melancholy, dreamy and hesitant ‚Äì and pensive ‚Äì likening the painting to Piero di Cosimo's Maria Maddalena. In London, very unusually for that time, she wore long oriental dresses, unlike the manner of American heiresses looking for an aristocratic husband. Also in 1884 she met the 72-year-old Robert Browning who was to become a major source of inspiration for her in her poetry writing. Caroline all her life was in rather frail health having problems with her lungs so she moved to the spa town of Cauterets in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es and then, next year, returned to Litchfield. In 1888 she met Browning in both London and Venice, at that time his home. She specially marked in her diary these meetings as significant events. In 1889 she wrote to Browning that the next best thing to having a conversation with him was to write a long letter and wait for the pleasure of receiving his reply. Sadly, Browning died shortly afterwards, on December 12, 1889. In 1888 the sixteen-year-old Bertrand Russell was at school with her younger brother Edward and he became a friend of the Fitzgerald family. Russell developed a romantic, though intellectual, attraction towards Caroline. Russell thought of her as \\"the ideal of young womanhood\\" and in her \\"I found liberalism in politics and religion, complete emancipation from vulgar prejudices, great culture and wide reading\\". Poetry in Fitzgerald's manuscript, 1887 Fitzgerald first published a collection of her poems in 1889 under the title Venetia Victrix and Other Poems , dedicated \\"To my friend Robert Browning\\". A manuscript version of the first poem in the book, \\"\\", exists dated 1887 and it is certain that Browning read some of her poems. Her second volume of poetry in 1904 was also dedicated to him. The first stanza of \\"\\" is ‚Äì Oscar Wilde reviewed Venetia Victrix in an article he wrote: \\"Three New Poets\\" in the Pall Mall Gazette. He approvingly noted Browning's influence and considered that \\"Venetia Victrix\\" \\"shows vigour, intellectual strength and courage\\". Wilde gave a lengthier review in The Woman's World magazine of which he was the editor. One of the poems \\"Hymn to Persephone\\" was included in the 1996 anthology British Women Poets of the Nineteenth Century and has been discussed in relation to the mythological figure . First marriage Vanity Fair\\" caricature) On November 23, 1889 she married Edmond George Fitzmaurice (styled Lord Fitzmaurice) ‚Äì he was 43 years old and she 24. Edmond had been educated at Eton and Cambridge and had been a Liberal party MP and junior minister though in 1889 he was out of office. It is likely they had met in Toronto when Fitzmaurice's elder brother Henry, Marquis of Landsdowne was Governor General of Canada between 1883 and 1888. From the start the marriage was not a success and quite rapidly became a failure. Fitzgerald's interests, her cultural interests, were completely unlike her husband's who enjoyed a country lifestyle with little intellectual stimulation. As time went by they came to live separately, she in their London townhouse. She often wrote (sometimes in Italian) explaining her unhappiness to an old family friend James Lacaita who was living in Florence. Despite her distance from her husband she remained on particularly good terms with her mother-in-law. Similar differences of interests would have affected many Anglo-American society marriages but few ended in separation because of the scandal of divorce. However Caroline was determined to be free again and, in particular, she had come to love Italy and wanted to live there. She set about getting her marriage nullified because, it was claimed, it had never been consummated. According to English law, a marriage could not be annulled on grounds of non- consummation before it had lasted three years so in August 1894 Caroline went to court ‚Äì her application was unopposed and a decree of nullity was made in October 1894 which became final in May 1895. After the divorce she sought to return some of her husband's family jewellery but his mother and aunt said they would like her to keep the jewels ‚Äì nothing had happened that should make her not want to keep them and they wanted to avoid increasing her suffering. In 1894 Russell had written to his fianc√©e Alys Pearsall Smith that, hearing of Caroline's impending divorce, he had always regretted Caroline's marriage and that \\"he couldn't help feeling a sort of joy to think she should get rid of him and start afresh\\". He supposed she married him for ambition rather than love. In Russell's 1967 autobiography he also said that \\"later she seemed an unmitigated bore\\" ‚Äì it may be that his sadness at her marriage still hurt. Henry James Henry James in about 1900 In the period leading up to her divorce Fitzgerald was busy reading books and keeping up with current affairs and she undertook an intense correspondence with Fanny Reay, wife of Donald Mackay, 11th Lord Reay. Despite the age difference the two women seemed to get on very well, sharing many interests and becoming close friends. From these letters it is clear Fitzgerald mixed with both aristocrats and intellectuals ‚Äì at a reception at her publishers in 1895 she met the eminent author Henry James and in the next year they started writing to each other regularly. James had already published his most famous novels and was undergoing a less successful phase with more experimental novels and plays. He was sometimes close to despair and no longer felt at home in London or its society. He contemplated leaving the capital finding he was happier enjoying the peace of the country at Rye whereas Fitzgerald enjoyed the social life of London. Life in Europe Fitzgerald travelled around Europe for extended periods of time visiting the major cultural cities, particularly admiring the architecture of Florence. Throughout her travels she met up with acquaintances, particularly American expatriates who welcomed her. In 1897 the cultural and intellectual environment of Rome intimidated her and when she met Max M√ºller, the German philosopher and orientalist, he told her his initial reaction had been the same. She became more confident in herself and as time went by she appreciated more the joy brought to her by seeing different places and meeting different people ‚Äì writers, painters, poets, intellectuals. Rome eventually became the city she preferred to live in. In Florence she met a young German archeologist, Georg Karo, who fell in love with her. She was happy for him to accompany her around, feeling safer with him than alone by herself and happy to meet his mother and sister. He introduced her to the new pastime of cycling. She became very attached to living in Rome, appreciating the cultural life, going to the opera, meeting many like-minded people. Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning Sir Frederic Kenyon was preparing a book on the letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning for publication and he consulted Fitzgerald to get her insight on Robert Browning as a person. She enthusiastically joined in with the project, carrying out some literary research, helping with selecting the letters and visiting Robert and Elizabeth's old haunts. Kenyon acknowledged her help (as Lady Edmond Fitzmaurice) when the book was published in 1897. She continued corresponding with Kenyon for the rest of her life. To illustrate the plane of criticism she could adopt, when Kenyon and Fitzgerald thought to collaborate on a possible biography of Robert Browning she wrote After she had been back in England for a while she went to Florence where she visited the Brownings' old house Casa Guidi and, with the help of Karo, she was able to meet their only son Robert Barrett Browning. Filippo De Filippi and second marriage Filippo De Filippi in 1900 In early 1898 Fitzgerald met Filippo De Filippi, a mountaineer, explorer and professor of surgery at the University of Bologna. De Filippi was 28 years old and the previous year on an expedition with the Duke of the Abruzzi he had climbed Mount Saint Elias. Fitzgerald met him when she went to a mountaineering lecture he gave in Rome. Shortly afterwards he went with Caroline's mother to a similar lecture given in London at the Royal Geographical Society given by her son Edward who was by then also a well-known mountaineer. As well as inviting De Filippi, Caroline had invited Henry James too but he was unable to attend ‚Äì from a letter he wrote to her a few days later it is clear that she had told him she had made a new friendship with \\"De Filippi\\", someone \\"extremely interesting\\". James and Fitzgerald wrote to each other more and more frequently with the writer encouraging her to pursue her friendship with De Filippi even though she still had an affectionate relationship with Karo. Caroline Fitzgerald in Florence De Filippi felt overawed by her intellect and by the high society she kept. In May 1898 he wrote to his mother doubting he had any hope of marrying Caroline but over a couple of years they kept on meeting ‚Äì with him telling her he was in love with her but she being unsure. By 1901 he was writing highly emotional love letters and was in despair when Caroline returned to England. Then, in May, she arranged a meeting with her mother and De Filippi and her mother approved of their marriage. De Filippi was now in the position of having to explain to his parents the reasons for Caroline's divorce, which he did by giving the example of the Ruskins. Other problems had to be overcome: the United States regarded Caroline as a British citizen and in Britain vice versa. Also by British custom she was still being called \\"Lady Edmond\\" and this was understood in Italy to mean that she was still a married woman. In August they visited Scotland together and on September 3, 1901 they married and toured the Swiss Alps for their honeymoon. The couple took a house in Rome and by 1902 they had bought a motor car for touring. They included Henry James on trips with them and he encouraged Edith Wharton to get a car as well, which she did in 1904. Since her childhood in America Fitzgerald had remained close to the Peskovs, a cosmopolitan Russian family who owned a castle in Salzburg. In 1903 with the Peskovs they travelled through Russia and the Caucasus to Turkestan including such places as Astrakhan, Bokhara, Samarkand and Tashkent and returning past the Black Sea and Crimea. De Filippi was to have gone on a 1906 expedition to the Rwenzori Mountains on the Uganda/Congo border, again led by Abruzzi, but Caroline was ill after the Turkestan tour so he stayed at home with her. In spite of her rather poor health they still travelled extensively in Europe and in 1907 met Edith Wharton in Paris. In 1909 Abruzzi again invited De Filippi on an expedition, this time to the Baltoro Glacier, near K2 in the Karakoram. Caroline travelled with him as far as Kashmir, sailing on the SS Oceana. She stayed at Srinigar and later Gulmarg while she waited for the expedition to return, before they travelled on together through Ladakh. For the massive two volume report , Fitzgerald was one of the translators for the English edition. Death and assessment Weakened by her travels and suffering from pneumonia, Fitzgerald died on December 25, 1911 at her home in Rome after a prolonged illness. While she is commemorated in a plaque with De Filippi at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, near to Shelley's grave, she is buried in her hometown of Litchfield, Connecticut, in the East Cemetery. De Filippi wrote to his friend, the explorer Aurel Stein, that his life no longer made sense and that he was shattered. According to Tom Longstaff writing De Filippi's own obituary in 1938 he never got over his wife's death. All the same he worked unceasingly, planning a large and very successful Kashmir‚ÄìBaltistan‚ÄìLadakh expedition he led during 1913 and 1914. Moving between The Gilded Age and La Belle √âpoque, according to her biographer, Fitzgerald's life strikingly resembled that of some of Henry James's American female protagonists in his novels ‚Äì Christina Light in Roderick Hudson (1875) and The Princess Casamassima (1886); the eponymous Daisy Miller (1878); Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady (1880) and Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove (1902). These women took responsibility for the choices they had personally made and lived their lives with a lack of compromise.

The road was incorporated into the Michigan State Trunkline Highway System in the 1910s, with a , pin-connected, Pratt pony truss bridge carrying the road over Sandstone Creek. In the 1920s, this bridge was deemed inadequate, and in 1927 the Michigan State Highway Department contracted with Walter Toebe and Company of Shingleton, Michigan, to construct a replacement bridge. The Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company of Milwaukee was hired to deliver the structural steel. Modern metal guardrails were later added along the inner faces of the railings, but the bridge still carries traffic along M-50. Description The M-50‚ÄìSandstone Creek Bridge is a steel deck, plate girder bridge with a span. It has a concrete deck with a two-lane, roadway. The deck is supported by nine concrete-encased plate girders. The bridge has concrete parapet railings, ornamented with recessed panels along the inner and outer faces.

Tropical Depression Usman originated first as a low-pressure area to the east of Palau on December 23. Slowly intensifying, the system became a tropical depression two days later. The system maintained its intensity while moving in a general west- northwestward direction approaching the eastern portion of the Philippine islands. However due to unfavorable conditions, the depression weakened into a remnant low on December 29, while making landfall over Eastern Samar thereafter. While the system possessed weaker winds, it brought torrential rainfall over much of Visayas, hitting the regions of Eastern Visayas and Bicol the hardest. Sea travel to the country was vastly disrupted during the holiday season. Torrential rain caused flooding to as high as 7 feet in Northern Samar. An estimated of 36,000 houses were damaged due to Usman. A total of 156 people perished during storm, while 26 people remain missing. Damage from Usman is estimated to be about ‚Ç±5.41 billion (US$103 million). After the season, the PAGASA struck off the name Usman from their naming lists because it exceeded more than ‚Ç±1 billion worth of damages. Meteorological history On December 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance that had developed about 657 km (409 mi) to the east of Palau. Around that time, the system was located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear and warm 28‚Äì30 ¬∞C (82.4‚Äì86 ¬∞F) sea-surface temperatures. The disturbance slowly intensified and the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert at about 09:00 UTC on December 24. At that time, the convection, or thunderstorm activity, around the system's low-level circulation center was rather sheared. Dvorak estimates were around T1.5 at the time, signalling that the system had 1-minute sustained winds of 45 km/h (30 mph). This prompted the JTWC to upgrade the disturbance to a tropical depression, with the system receiving the designation 35W. By 21:00 UTC of the same day, visible satellite imagery showed shallow rain banding (which is a cloud structure that is associated with an area of rain and thunderstorms) wrapping into a tight, but exposed center, with poorly organised convection. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system to be a weak tropical depression at around 06:00 UTC of December 25. Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) had reported that the depression had entered their area of responsibility and assigned the local name Usman. The JMA began issuing advisories on 12:00 UTC of December 25, when they considered that the tropical depression had 10-minute sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). With Usman's ragged center, the system remained disorganised, as wind shear was becoming displaced to the northwest. By 03:00 UTC on December 26, satellite imagery depicted that the system had multiple, minor circulation centers revolving around its original center. The storm's structure became somewhat disorganised due to the lack of convection, being blown off by the southeasterly wind shear. The system maintained its intensity until the next day, when satellite imagery showed a broad circulation with excellent outflow along with extensive deep convection flaring near its center. At this point, both the JMA and the JTWC predicted that the system would intensify into a tropical storm within the next 24 hours. Thereafter, convection had increased around the system, and the system's center became much more organised. At 00:00 UTC on December 28, the JTWC reported that the system's 1-minute sustained winds to 55 km/h (35 mph). A cold cold cover began obscuring the system's elongated center, thereafter. On December 29, the system's central cold cover began to dissipate, and the JTWC had stated that the system began weakening and deteriorating. Tropical Depression Usman made landfall in Borongan, Eastern Samar on 06:00 UTC of the same day, as the PAGASA downgraded the system to a low-pressure area. The JMA stated that the system was located in an area of increasing wind shear. Several hours later, both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system. Preparations and impact On December 27, as Tropical Depression Usman inches closer to the eastern portion of the Philippines, the PAGASA raised a Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #1 over much of the Bicol region and the Eastern Visayas region, with some even extending as north as Quezon province and as west as Cebu. Local officials advised residents at that time to take precautionary measures in areas of low- lying and mountainous areas, especially those living near river channels. The PAGASA also warned on sea travel, either to fishermen or those with small sea crafts, are risky in the seaboards of Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and the Surigao provinces due to rough seas combined with the northeast monsoon. Heavy rains that could trigger landslides and flashfloods were expected in the areas under the alert signals. Roughly 1,000 passengers later became stranded in Bacolod after sea travel was suspended. The region of Western Visayas, which includes the island of Palawan, was raised a TCWS #1 on December 28, as 851 passengers were stranded in that region alone. As of 5 p.m. local time, the NDRRMC raised the \\"blue alert\\" status in much of the Western Visayas region, meaning that 50 percent of the RDRRMC personnel are on standby for emergencies and it is the second highest alert level. At this point, the number of passengers stranded from the cause of suspended sea travel rose to 13,000, where 6,000 of them were from the Bicol Region. In the city of Tacloban, their mayor ordered to suspend work in government offices and their local officials have set up 71 evacuation centres ready for displaced families. Following the landfall and the deterioration of the tropical depression, widespread flooding and landslides were reported in many areas. Six towns in Masbate saw 61 families, or 259 individuals forced to evacuate their homes due to extreme flooding. Local officials in the area also lifted the temporary ban for sea travel on the morning of December 29 to allow the remaining stranded passengers to travel. This was the same in the Bicol Region were 3,900 people were evacuated. In Northern Samar, the heavy rained caused flooding to as high as 2‚Äì7 ft (24-84 inches). In Bicol, 473.1 mm (18.6 in) of rain was recorded for the two days of December 28 and 29. Strong winds and heavy rain from Usman caused the shutdown of some power plants, which led to power outages in some areas In Albay, Catanduanes and Eastern Visayas. On December 30, a state of calamity was raised in the provinces of Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte and Sorsogon, along with the municipality of Polangui in Albay. Eight other municipalities in Oriental Mindoro were also raised a state of calamity by local officials on the next day. Throughout the country, a total of 238,127 families were affected by Usman. About 36,574 houses were either partially or totally damaged. A total of 156 people have died from the storm, with 105 people being injured. 26 people have remained missing. An estimated cost of damages were toppled to ‚Ç±5.41 billion (US$103 million), where ‚Ç±1.95 billion (US$37.1 million) were to be part of agricultural damages and ‚Ç±3.46 billion (US$65.9 million) were to be part of infrastructure damages. Aftermath and retirement On January 2019, Mahar Lagmay, a Disaster scientist, claimed that the high death toll by the system was caused by the PAGASA issuing incorrect and misleading forecasts for Tropical Depression Usman. The PAGASA then responded to the scientist's statement regarding this claim, and stated that Lagmay had used the \\"hour rainfall intensity\\" classification instead of the \\"24-hour accumulated rainfall\\" classification, where it has been used commonly in their tropical cyclone bulletins. Local officials also criticised the PAGASA due to the fact how their residents became confused and complacent when Usman was downgraded to a low-pressure area, which also meant the PAGASA lifting any storm signals. The PAGASA later addressed and confirmed this, however they explained that the storm signals are distinct from the amount of rainfall accumulated, as the signals described more of the expected winds in the area. They also added that they did release a weather advisory on the low- pressure area (that was once Usman) on December 29 regarding that \\"moderate to heavy rains will continue over Bicol Region in the next 24 hours.\\" Because the system caused damages of over ‚Ç±1 billion, the PAGASA retired the name Usman, despite it being used for the first time in their naming lists. In March 2019, the PAGASA revised their lists and replaced the name with Umberto for the 2022 season.

She is currently Professor of World Christianity at the University of St Andrews. She is best known for her work studying khipus and hybrid khipu-alphabetic texts in the Central Andes and is credited with the first potential phonetic decipherment of an element of a khipu. She has also written extensively about the interaction between Spanish missionaries and the Inca in colonial Peru, focusing on language, religion and missionary culture, as well as the history of the Chanka people. Hyland's research has appeared in media outlets around the world, such as the BBC World Service, National Geographic, Scientific American, and Slate. In 2011, National Geographic filmed a documentary about her research on khipu boards as part of their series Ancient X-Files.  Life and career   Early life and education  Sabine Hyland (n√©e Campbell) was born in Maryland in 1964. She grew up in Dryden, New York, near Cornell University where her father, Joseph Kearns Campbell, was a Professor of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. Her mother Sigrid is a German immigrant to the United States. Sabine spent some of her formative years abroad when her father was working at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and the International Potato Center in Lima. The year she spent living in Lima as a teenager sparked her interest in studying Peru. Hyland received her first degree in Anthropology from Cornell in 1986, graduating magna cum laude with distinction and Phi Beta Kappa. She also studied Quechua at Cornell. She earned a PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 1994, where she was supervised by Richard Burger and also studied under Mike Coe and John Middleton. Her doctoral thesis on the subject of Jesuit Blas Valera was later reworked into her first monograph, The Jesuit and the Incas: The Extraordinary Life of Padre Blas Valera, S.J. (2003). Sabine married fellow academic William Hyland in 1989. They have two children, Margaret and Eleanor.  Career  After working at Yale as a teaching assistant, Hyland held subsequent positions at Conception Seminary College in Kansas and Columbus State University in Georgia during the 1990s, teaching Latin American missionary history and anthropology. In 1999 she was appointed as Assistant Professor of Anthropology at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, where she later achieved the rank of Associate Professor. She became a member of the American Anthropological Association and the American Society for Ethnohistory. While teaching at St. Norbert, she published widely on Peruvian ethnohistory and religion. Although she had always been interested in khipus and the possibility that they could be decoded, it was during this period that a desire to understand more about how khipus encoded information began to guide her research interests. In 2011, she was contacted by Rebeca Arcayo Aguado, a schoolteacher in Mangas, about a khipu board that had been kept in the local church. This board had a khipu cord associated with each Spanish name, making it an example of a hybrid khipu-alphabetic text. Funded by the National Geographic Society, Hyland travelled to Mangas to study the khipu. Her research on khipu boards, a herding khipu collected by Max Uhle in 1895, and other khipus surviving in Andean communities led her to argue that the ply direction of knots on khipu cords and the colour of the fibre were significant ways of encoding meaning in khipus. Aside from her khipu studies, Hyland also worked on the history of the Chanka with archaeologist Brian S. Bauer. In 2004, she was honoured by Miguel Suarez Contreras, the head of the Chanka nation, as an honorary member of the Chanka nation in thanks for her work \\"on behalf of the Chanka people\\". She also continued working on historical texts about the Inca, publishing an edition of the Quito Manuscript, a text on Inca history preserved by Fernando de Montesinos, and an edition of Blas Valera's work called Gods of the Andes: An Early Jesuit Account of Inca Religion and Andean Christianity (2011). In 2012, Sabine Hyland was appointed as a Reader in Social Anthropology at the University of St Andrews, later promoted to Professor in 2018. She served for five years as the Director of the Centre for Amerindian Studies. Her research into khipu epistles which were used in the Andes as part of rebellions against the Spanish government in the 18th century led her to argue that these khipu \\"letters\\" contained phonetic representations of the ayllus, or community lineages, who sent and received them. This information was encoded through colour, animal fibre, and ply direction. This revelation was the first potential decipherment of an element in a khipu since Leslie Leland Locke decoded how khipus recorded numbers in 1923. Hyland's research about khipus has featured in documentaries made by National Geographic and Discovery Channel. She has also served as a consultant for television and appeared on History Channel's series Mankind: The Story of All of Us. In 2018 she was interviewed on the BBC World Service. She has won several grants from institutions such as the Leverhulme Trust and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and she was made a Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 2019 after receiving a grant for her project \\"Hidden Texts of the Andes: Deciphering the Cord Writing of Peru\\". The work of Hyland and other researchers to decipher the khipus has been compared to a search for an Inca \\"Rosetta Stone\\" and seeks to reframe the question of whether indigenous American societies other than the Mayans had writing systems, and what it means to have a \\"three-dimensional writing system\\" recorded through textile.

Between 1956 and 1972 he was the leader of the powerful IG Metall (Industrial Union of Metalworkers). In a tribute published in 1967 to celebrate Brenner's sixtieth birthday the politician-commentator Peter von Oertzen wrote that \\"Otto Brenner ... embodies more than any other German trades union leader that generation - a link between the older generation of the Weimar years [before 1933] and the younger generation that grew to maturity after 1945 - which rescued the best traditions of the German labour movement to the present day, bridging the intervening abyss of the Fascist rule\\". The Otto-Brenner Foundation for the promotion of scientific research and knowledge is named after him, as is the annually awarded Otto-Brenner (journalism) prize. Life Provenance and early years Otto Brenner was born and grew up in Hanover, the third of his parents' four children. His mother was a \\"washerwoman\\". With the outbreak of war his father was conscripted for military service and life became harder: Otto was just seven. Hanover was (and remains) home to several large engineering/manufacturing businesses: Brenner eventually trained successfully for work as an industrial electrician. However, the family was not wealthy, and the immediate postwar period was one of acute economic hardship. When he first left school the family could not afford for him to embark on any sort of period of training. Instead he went to work first as a grocery store assistant and then for a small business that manufactured boilers. Here he was engaged in physically heavy work as a rivet-warmer and rivet-presser. He worked next to an extremely hot industrial furnace which produced high levels of carbon monoxide. By the time he reached the age of fifteen he had contracted a severe lung disease which would leave him vulnerable to lung disorders for the rest of his life. Politics and trades unionism He joined the Young Socialists in 1920 and the Metal Workers' Union in 1922. Driven by a conviction that alcohol and tobacco were contributing to the catastrophic material condition and what he perceived as the political lethargy of working people, he campaigned energetically against their misuse, and in 1926 founded a local branch of the German Workers' Abstinence League (\\"Deutscher Arbeiter-Abstinenten-Bund\\" / DAAB), taking on the chairmanship himself. He would remain a life-long non- smoker and vegetarian. He consumed alcohol only very sparingly. Meanwhile, it was at the social events organised by the Young Socialists that he met Martha Werner who would subsequently become his wife. It was in 1925, after a period of illness, that he took unskilled work in the electrical components section of the local Hanomag railway locomotive and road vehicle plant. Taking advantage of adult education opportunities and evening training sessions, he was soon able to qualify as a skilled assembly worker. As a young man he became a sports and fitness enthusiast. He also demonstrated a commitment to political education, leading the Marxist study circle of the Hanover Young Socialists and developing his own (not always uncritical) philosophy of socialism. At around the same time that he launched the local DAAB branch, by now aged 21, he also joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Between 1 November and 3 December 1928 he participated in the so-called Ruhr Iron Strike (\\"Ruhreisenstreit\\") which involved, according to at least one source, the largest industrial lock-out in the industrial north-west of Germany during the entire Weimar period. In the end the strikers succeeded in pushing through significant wage increases. Brenner drew valuable lessons about both the responsibilities and the sheer power of trades unions from the experience. However, the Wall Street Crash ten months later ushered in a period of sustained economic downturn across Europe. Unemployment in Germany rose to six million: those affected suffered real hardship. In 1931 Otto Brenner became one of them. Brenner had long held a strong belief in the power of self-education, however, and over the several years of unemployment that ensued he was able to devote more time to reading political books. As later as 1932 the SPD held the largest number of seats in the Reichstag (national parliament), and even at the July 1932 election they still comfortably out-polled the Communists. Nevertheless, the rise of the extremists and of other right wing parties meant the SPD were no longer part of the government coalition after 1930. It was therefore from a position of relative political weakness that in 1931 the party supported the building of a new generation of war tanks. Citing a \\"credibility deficit\\", Brenner resigned angrily from the party. According to some reports he was expelled from it. Either way, he now joined the breakaway Socialist Workers' Party (\\" Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD). By the start of 1932 the local SAPD for Braunschweig-Hanover had a membership of around 200, and they elected Brenner their branch chairman. The defining purpose of the SAPD was to promote a coming together between the SPD and the Communists (KPD) in order to protect the country from a take-over by right-wing populists. Brenner decried what he saw as the \\"capitulation policy\\" (\\"Kapitulationspolitik\\") of the SPD leadership and their trades union allies. Later he would make it clear that he believed that the SPD must accept a share of the responsibility for the collapse of Germany's first republic. He called for a \\"united proletarian front\\" of the KPD, SPD and SAPD. His urgent arguments, and those of fellow SAPD activists, failed to find significant resonance within the SPD and the KPD, however. In the light of developments in the German Federal Republic (West Germany) after the Nazi nightmare ended in 1945, it is nevertheless important to emphasize that through the 1930s Brenner never stopped supporting the economic positions of the SPD, especially with regard to economic democracy (\\"Wirtschaftsdemokratie\\") as propounded by two particularly influential economists, Peretz Naftali and Rudolf Hilferding. For them, and for Otto Brenner, economic democracy offered the route towards a socialist democratic structure by means of a gradual and peaceful transition. The 1929 market crash and the economic depression that followed, along with the subsequent paralysis of the Reichstag that was ended only by the National Socialist take-over in January 1933, all combined to strengthen Brenner's conviction that, in the context of the relationship between economics and the world of politics, the underlying principal for trades unions must always be that democracy is a prerequisite for trades union activities, and economic actions must be subject to democratic control. National Socialism and war Regime change was followed by a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship during the first part of 1933. The SAPD, like most other political parties, became illegal. Otto Brenner nevertheless believed in the need to use the party as an instrument of resistance to tyranny, and despite the ban continued to work on party recruitment and organisation. There are references to his having led and/or been part of the \\"SAPD Resistance Group\\" in Hanover with his brother and sister-in-law Kurt and K√§te Brenner. He visited a number of cities in order to create and build contacts with local SAPD parties across the country. During the summer of 1933 he was also involved with the Committee for Proletarian Unity, a resistance group built up since 1930 by the Hanover communist Eduard Wald, apparently in anticipation of the National Socialist take-over. The extent and nature of Brenner's involvement in the group is hard to determine, however, and it probably lasted for no more than a few months. An important personal development was Brenner's marriage to his long-time friend Martha Werner on 3 August 1933. In the immediate aftermath of the Reichstag fire the authorities concentrated their harassment/persecution on political activists identified as communists. Many were arrested and others fled abroad. On 30 August 1930, however, after he returned from one of his trips, Otto Brenner was arrested and taken into investigatory custody. During the eighteen months of uncertainty that followed he was permitted to remain in touch with his wife by letter. The charge, when it came on 9 May 1935, was the usual one under these circumstances: \\"Preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). The verdict was largely a foregone conclusion, but the sentence, delivered by the Hamm District Court on 25 June 1935, was relatively mild. He was sentenced to a two-year jail term. This had largely been spent in pre-trial detention, and a few months later he was able to return to his wife in Hanover-Buchholz. He remained under police surveillance till the end of the 1939-45 war, however. Following release he was permitted to work as an electrician in and around Hanover, though during the next ten years the risk of re-arrest never went away. He was deemed \\"wehrunw√ºrdig\\" (\\"unfit for military service\\") and therefore, despite the return of war in September 1939, he avoided conscription. He was, however, sent to work in Frankfurt on civil engineering projects and as a courier for the Frankfurter Zeitung. A couple of years after the war started, on 1 October 1941, Heike Brenner, the Brenners' only child, was born. During the final part of the war Brenner was back in Hanover, able to experience the destructive British and American bombing which peaked in the Autumn/Fall of 1943; but the bombs continued to drop till April 1945.Civil Defense Division: The United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Hanover-Field- Report. Second Edition, 1947, pp. 125‚Äì128.J√∂rg Friedrich: Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940‚Äì1945, p. 83 Having lived through the German disaster between 1933 and 1945, Otto Brenner drew one conclusion in particular to which he would remain true for the rest of his life: \\"Another 1933 must never be allowed to happen.\\" Aftermath of war Hanover was liberated by the US 84th Infantry Division on 10 April 1945.Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946 (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 156. Otto Brenner and his family had survived. Filled with the hope that it might at last be possible to build a new life Brenner committed himself unreservedly to rebuilding the city. True to his longstanding conviction that the war represented a crisis-management response to issues involving capitalist means of production, he concluded that under a capitalist system there could never be true peace. This meant that the post-war order must deliver a non-exploitative, non-capitalist socialist society. After various exploratory political contacts, he decided to rejoin the Social Democrats. Although the important decision would have been his alone, one factor in it will have been discussion with Kurt Schumacher who had settled in Hanover following his liberation from the Neuengamme concentration camp. Schumacher also persuaded Brenner to become active in local and \\"national\\" politics in (and possibly beyond) what was administered between 1945 and 1949 as the British occupation zone. Rebuilding trades unionism Early on Brenner decided to devote himself to recreating the trades unions, which had been destroyed under the Hitler government. In May 1945 he was a co-founder of the General Trades Union in the territory which by the end of 1946 had been relaunched as the state of Lower Saxony (\\"Allgemeinen Gewerkschaft Niedersachsen\\"). In 1947 he became chairman of the union's Metals Division (\\"Wirtschaftsgruppe Metall\\"), and thereby a paid trades union official. The structure of the General Trades Union reflected a compromise for the creation of a single unified trades union, free from political and religious, but also free of professional/vocational distinctions. Brenner however, like most trades unionists, advocated a structure involving individual industry-sector based trades unions organised under the aegis of a single trades union confederation: that is the structure that was subsequently adopted and which operates to this day. The first industrial strike in postwar Germany took place in December 1946 at the Hanover plant of Bode-Panzer. It lasted 23 days.Reinhard Schwitzer: 50 Jahre Bode-Panzer-Streik Hannover 1946‚Äì1996. Veranstaltung anl√§√ülich der 3. Vertreterversammlung der IG Metall- Verwaltungsstelle Hannover am 23. November 1996. Industriegewerkschaft Metall f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Verwaltungsstelle Hannover, Hannover 1997. Brenner was the most prominent of the strike leaders, and his name appeared in news reports far beyond the Hanover city limits. The dispute, taking place when Germany was still under the \\"dictatorship of military occupation\\", was in support of \\"the socialisation of production and economic democracy\\". Brenner demanded \\"full co-decision rights for factory and office employees in the enterprise and in the economy\\". After a hard-fought struggle Brenner succeeded in concluding a benchmark agreement, which gave the works council a comprehensive package of co-determination rights covering recruitment, remuneration, production planning and working methods. In most cases other businesses in the area, when threatened with strike action, chose to head off the threat by adopting equivalent agreements in respect of their own factories. His reputation buoyed by these successes, in 1947 Brenner became district head of what would become IG Metall Hanover. Trades unions as an engine for social reform For Otto Brenner political and social democracy were indivisible. Therefore, his principal twin-track objective for the postwar order was for economic democracy and co-determination. Even if the top priority for a negotiation was wage rates, his approach to trades union strategy was always a far wider one, grounded in a social philosophical vision. For him the unions had a comprehensive political, social and cultural mandate to fulfill: that involved achieving social change through democratic methods. That meant that for Brenner, capitalism, which after 1949 West Germans experienced as the \\"social market economy\\" (\\"soziale Marktwirtschaft\\"), also incorporated private ownnership of the means of production, giving rise to an unequal balance of power and control/ownership in the political sphere. From this clearly followed, for him, that the cream of sustained German postwar prosperity would fade relatively quickly. He therefore hoped for an overcoming of capitalism or, failing that, a far reaching taming of it. He summarized his underlying conviction in the following way: \\"The economy is not there simply to serve its own ends. It has to serve human needs and society's objectives\\". This also corresponded with the \\"Economic Policy Ground-rules\\" - generally referred to subsequently as the \\"Munich Ground-rules Programme\\" (\\"M√ºnchener Grundsatzprogramm\\") - adopted by the German Trades Union Confederation (\\"Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / DGB) at its (re)founding congress in Munich in October 1949. A particular case in point is the programme's demand for \\"the transfer of key industries to common ownership, especially the mining, iron and steel industries, as well as the major chemicals firms, the energy sector, major transport providers and credit institutes\\". During the early 1950s Otto Brenner was a member of the \\"Circle of Ten\\" (\\"Zehnerkreis\\"). This was an informal group of leading decision makers from IG Metall and the DGB. The fact that their regular meetings were \\"secret\\" seems, over time, to have intensified interest in the \\"Circle\\" among commentators and journalists. Other members included Brenner's former ISK friends Hermann Beermann and Werner Hansen. There were also three former communists: Eduard Wald, Kuno Brandel and \\"Siggi\\" Neumann. Behind the scenes the \\"Circle of Ten\\" exercised a powerful influence over key personnel selections and strategic decisions taken by the trades union movement. During the later 1950s the circle disintegrated as the members' socio-political ambitions diverged. The West German election result of 1949 saw Konrad Adenauer's CDU-FDP coalition narrowly winning power, which was both a disappointment for SPD supporters (such as Otto Brenner) and a surprise for commentators and others from across the political spectrum. For Brenner and the trades union movement more widely the result represented a temporary deferral but not an abolition for their shared objective of a rapid and fundamental transformation of social relationships in the newly launched German Federal Republic (West Germany). Between 1952 and 1956 Otto Brenner served as vice-chairman of IG Metall, with Hans Br√ºmmer as senior chairman. A second general election defeat for the SPD in 1953 was deeply disappointing. There would be no rapid end to \\"capitalism\\". Brenner refused to see that as a reason to compromise on the basic tenets of the \\"Munich Programme\\" agreed within the DGB in 1949. Indeed, he saw it as all the more reason to intensify pressure to address the most extreme social inequalities, even if in the short term the best - or only - route available to the unions in pursuit of that objective might be ratcheting up pressure in respect of wages negotiations. Eloquent testimony to this was commitment was the commitment he showed to the developing and implementing the DGB action plan which he himself co-initiated in May 1954.Otto Brenner: \\"Wir brauchen ein gewerkschaftliches Aktionsprogramm\\", in: \\"Metall\\" 12 May 1954 By means of significant wage and salary increases, the introduction of holiday pay and the gradual move to a 40-hour working week. IG Metall under his influence - and subsequently under his leadership - made a crucial contribution to improving the quality of life for both workers and employers, in a country where rapid economic recovery and growth were by this time opening the way to increased levels of general prosperity. Because of the extent to which Brenner set the course for IG Metall as vice-chairman, there was no major change of direction when he assumed sole leadership of the union in 1956. Brenner was feared as a tough negotiator, but capable of compromise, his demands were not simply for parity between negotiating partners, but also that employers and employees should receive a fair share of the wealth they jointly generated. The reduction in the working week was also, in part, an excursion into emancipatory social policy, giving as it did more free time both to workers and to employers. By 1965, step by step, the point had been reached where the union and the metals industry employers signed off on the core 40-hour week, running from Monday to Friday. But there was, again, a consciously social element in all this, which is expressed in the slogan \\"Dad belongs to me on Saturdays\\" (\\"Samstag geh√∂rt Vati mir!\\"). There was also an understanding that reducing the standard working week could be a way to secure more jobs, thereby doing something to counteract the steady march of \\"workplace rationalisation\\". Politics Alongside the business of wage negotiations and promoting a social-political strategy, there was necessarily always a more directly party-political dimension to trades union leadership during Otto Brenner's time at the top. From beyond the no longer so porous internal border, reports seeping through from friends and relatives of the short-lived and brutally suppressed 1953 East German uprising did nothing to refute the growing belief that the postwar Communist Party of Germany should best be understood as a proxy for Soviet imperialist aspirations. Nevertheless, the Communist party's rebranded sister party east of the \\"iron Curtain\\" had become the ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship. Despite the fact that in West Germany the Communist Party never came close to receiving the levels of electoral support it had enjoyed before 1933, the power underlying Soviet-backed communism was a reality in West Germany from 1945 till long after Brenner left the stage. In the inter-union conflicts that were a feature of the West German industrial scene during the 1950s he was uncompromising in his hostility to communist activism, which he saw as a serious threat to trades union solidarity. Within IG Metall Brenner rigorously excluded from positions of power any trades unionists who refused to distance themselves from the goals of the KPD and SED. Just as resolutely - if a little less brutally - he rejected aspirations to positions of power of any \\"Christian-Socialist\\" unionists who, even while they complained that the DGB's close links to the Social Democratic Party undermined party-political neutraility, were themselves closely associated with the centre-right CDU and (Bavarian) CSU whose influence within the DGB they were happy (if without much success) to try and promote. Under Brenner's leadership IG Metall saw itself explicitly as a \\"political trades union\\", with not just the right, but the duty to \\"take a position on political questions that affect the welfare of millions of working people\\", and not to restrict itself to the narrow fields of wages and social policy.Otto Brenner, \\"Gewerk- schaft und Kulturpolitik¬´.Referat auf der 12. Vertreterversammlung des Gesamtverbandes Braunschweigischer Lehrer, 10 April 1957, in: \\"Ausgew√§hlte Reden\\", p. 142. Brenner claimed this duty of intervene most especially if he saw that the democratic principles of the Federal Republic were threatened, because he recognised that preserving the rule of law in as democratic state governed by laws was the indispensable precondition for the successful operation of trades unions. His own experiences led him to doubt the democratic substance of postwar West German democracy. The Spiegel affair in 1962 confirmed him in his assessment that \\"the democratic order, and above all those called upon to serve as its guardians, are still not immune from the temptations of authoritarian undemocratic operations\\".Otto Brenner: Die Gewerkschaften in Staat und Wirtschaft, Vortrag vor dem Demokratischen Hochschulbund in Braunschweig, 13 February 1964, in: \\"Gewerkschaftliche Dynamikin unserer Zeit\\", Frankfurt/M.1966 p.11 A few years later he unhesitatingly lined up the union alongside the \\"Extra parliamentary opposition\\" during the run-up to the contentious \\"Emergency Acts\\" constitutional amendments eventually imposed on the country in 1968 by the Allied Control Council. His distrust of a resurgent authoritarian militarism caused him to reject West German re-armament and, in particular to oppose nuclear rearmament or the stationing of nuclear forces in German soil. His opposition to the arms build-up was reinforced by his conviction that militarisation on the ground made it even harder to envisage any future peaceful reunification of the two Germanies on either side of the iron curtain. That was also why he opposed the Paris conventions ratified in 1955, which he saw as a move to integrate West Germany into the west. He contended that if the two German states were integrated into competing international power blocs, a rapid peaceful reunification would become unthinkable. The real problem for Brenner and IG Metall was that during the postwar decades there was, in West Germany, no appetite for the politics of the left. At home the economic and socio-political fruits of the so-called Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) years did little to engender political protest. Internationally the use of Soviet military muscle in 1956 to crush reform movements in Hungary and Poland, the Suez Crisis of the same year, the sealing off of the internal German border during the 1950s, culminating in with the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the overall intensification of cold war tensions which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war combined to determine that during the 1950s and most of the 1960s insufficient West Germany voters were willing to vote against the centre-right CDU/CSU coalition under the reassuring leaderships of Adenauer, Erhard and Kiesinger. A succession of disappointing results in national elections persuaded the SPD to take a fundamentally new direction in the later 1950s, transforming itself from a \\"socialist workers' party\\" to a \\"people's party\\". The new strategy was embodied in the Godesberg Program, ratified at a party convention on 15 November 1959. Overtly Marxist terms such as \\"class struggle\\", \\"socialisation of key industrial sectors\\" and \\"planned economy\\" were consigned to history. There was to be no more talk of a new socialist order. In its place, the party committed to further developments, improvements and refinements of existing economic and social structures. This \\"course correction\\" to the party programme went decisively beyond what might have been acceptable to Otto Brenner, who argued consistently for the retention of the earlier party objectives, the most pressing of which was, for him and his union comrades, \\"socialisation of key industrial sectors\\". He campaigned with characteristic energy against the changes, both in the discussions that took place between 1954 and 1958 with the \\"programme commission\\" drawing up what became the Godesberg Program and, especially, in parallel discussions for a new Godesberg-compatible Trades Union Confederation (DGB) programme. Within the DGB this set him at odds with the so-called modernisers, such as Georg Leber, the long-standing leader of the IG Bau-Steine-Erden (loosely, \\"building workers' union\\"), who was advocating a departure from the \\"Munich programme\\" of 1949 and a new conception of trades unionism based on social partnership. For Brenner that was totally unacceptable. Specifically, if the need to obtain political power with a democratic parliamentary majority meant converting the SPD from a \\"class-party\\" to a \\"people's party\\", the result would be to blur the inherent conflict of interests between labour and capital, and involve transforming the two sides in a wages negotiation into \\"social partners\\". Brenner rejected such a model, as did his colleagues on the union executive. With equal vigour they rejected Leber's attempts to redefine the role of trades unions in the state and in society. Brenner also rejected repeated demands that trades unions must take a share in responsibility for the wider economy. He was challenged with the metaphor that the unions were in the same boat as other members of society. The destiny of the nation was a shared destiny for good and ill. Brenner would reply that everyone was indeed in the same boat and all could look forward to a shared destiny. But that was no reason to feign indifference as to the identity of the pilot, the composition of the ship's crew and the small matter of how decisions were made as to the direction of travel.Otto Brenner: Rede auf der SPD-Mit-gliederversammlung im Palmengarten Frankfurt/M.,20 August 1957, in: Ausgew√§hlte Reden, p. 153. It must be acknowledged that despite the vehemence with which he opposed the Godesberg changes and the differences of opinion involved, Brenner refused to infer any conflict of interest between the SPD and the trades unions. Between Social Democracy and the free trades union movement in West Germany there existed an \\"organic solidarity\\" firmly entrenched in shared underlying interests. City council and regional parliament Between 1946 and 1953 Brenner served as an SPD City councillor (\\"Ratsherr\\") in Hannover. Between 6 May 1951 and his exclusion from it 15 February 1954 he was a member of the Landtag of Lower Saxony, representing the Hannover-Linden electoral district. During that period he served, between 14 June 1951 and 9 February 1953 as chairman of the assembly's Social Affairs committee.Barbara Simon: Abgeordnete in Niedersachsen 1946‚Äì1994: biographisches Handbuch, 1996, p. 53 Fundamental beliefs Brenner never compromised his conviction that the \\"strike weapon\\" was inalienable as a means to enforce workers' rights in any bourgeois democracy. The absence of any \\"right to strike\\" was one of his core criticisms of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany): a party and a government that denied workers the fundamental right to strike had no right to hold itself out as representing the interests of the workers, nor any right to solicit favours from the trades union movement in West Germany or to impart \\"good advices\\" (\\"gute Ratschl√§ge\\") to them. For almost ten years Brenner was among those opposing the \\"Emergency Acts\\" constitutional amendments (which eventually came into force, as the 17th amendment, in 1968). In his judgement, consciously or unconsciously, they were a means whereby the political class put West Germany's young democracy on the line. It mattered. When they passed the so-called \\"Basic Law\\" (provisional constitution) in 1949, the legislators had left out any comprehensive regulation in respect of a potential emergency situation concerning the reservation of rights to the allied occupying powers. In the event of a domestic emergency (such as a natural catastrophe) or an international emergency (such as a war) there were simply a set of \\"laws in the cupboard\\" (\\"Schubladengesetze\\") which, if implemented, would impose severe constraints on citizens' rights. It was only on 5 May 1955 that West Germany was declared to enjoy \\"the full authority of a sovereign state\\", following the Paris agreements the previous year: this opened up the possibility for \\"completion\\" of the constitutional settlement, and the point was one which West Germany's allies had been insistent. A succession of West German governments set to work to make good the earlier omission, but every draft proposal for incorporating provision of \\"emergency acts\\" in the constitution involved drastic curtailments of fundamental human rights. Brenner was able to bring a keen historical perspective to the matter, having himself lived through the curtailment of basic rights during the Hitler years. The National Socialist government had invoked \\"emergency\\" conditions to introduce \\"emergency legislation\\" which had put an end to democracy for twelve years, and it was hard to find anyone who would assert that the government of that time had used its enhanced powers to benefit the people. The \\"emergency acts\\" constitutional amendments threatened to the constitutional legality of trades unions. Taking the matter back to first principles, Brenner was convinced that the constitutional rules imposed in 1919 and again in 1949 had left the way open for a \\"legally sanctioned\\" reversal of history, taking the country back to a pre-democratic condition (which, many believed, was already happening in East Germany). West Germany remained a \\"capitalist class-based society\\": the role of the trades unions in defending the positions of working people was an important one. Just as he compared the proposed \\"emergency acts\\" with the infamous Article 48 of the Weimar constitution, he recalled the greatest general strike in German history, which the unions had organised in 1920 (as requested by some government ministers) to defend the young republic against the Kapp Putsch. Otto Brenner always believed that there was a residual latent danger of Fascism in the German Federal Republic (West Germany), not because he feared a National Socialist revival in the state formed under Adenauer during the 1950s. The risk he saw was rather the progressive distortion of the democracy through a combination of mistakes by politicians, economic crises and socio-psychological insecurities. Within the DGB and the SPD only a minority of the memberships shared Brenner's views over this. Eventually, during the course of coalition negotiations in 1966, the SPD and the CDU agreed to a version of the \\"Emergency Acts\\" constitutional amendments which passed into law in 1968. Brenner respected the Bundestag decision, much to the disappointment of various younger union colleagues who had hoped that he would call a general strike over the issue. Brenner was adamant that as a democrat he had to respect a parliamentary majority decision even when he believed it to wrong. At the 9th IG Metall congress in 1968 he spelled out his position: \\"Calling a general strike against a decision by parliament, as some trades unionists had demanded, was quite impossible. It would have meant opposing the existing constitutional order, and in any case, there was no way that a call for a general strike would have been obeyed by a majority of the people\\". Expecting that Otto Brenner might call a general strike against a government in which his own party was a coalition partner would have involved expecting a long-standing champion of social-democracy to become a revolutionary. Brenner was no revolutionary and never wished to become one. Otto Brenner died of Cardiovascular disease in April 1972, aged just 64. Werner Th√∂nnessen, his former presschief, contributed an obituary to Der Spiegel: \\"achieving Civil democracy 'by democratising the economy became Brenner's greatest objective. He found his failure to achieve it a painful thing. Acutely aware of the inherent contradiction in which trades unions become enmeshed if they try to enforce improvements to the economic order from the bottom up, which nevertheless become necessary both to improve the condition of the workers and to extend the life expectancy of capitalism\\".Werner Th√∂nnessen:¬ªWas dann folgen wird,liegt noch im dunkeln¬´,zitiert nach ders.: Mein Torzur Welt.

Three years after L‚Äôodissea, Rossi realizes another quality peplum, spectacular (cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, costumes by Luciano Ricceri) but not without cultural depth. Giulio Brogi makes the protagonist a modern character, tormented and divided. The miniseries is later adapted for the big screen. * Il mulino del Po second series (The mill on the Po) ‚Äì by Sandro Bolchi, who had already directed the first series in 1963; in four episodes, from the second and third chapter of the Riccardo Bacchelli's trilogy; with Valeria Moriconi, Raoul Grassilli, Ottavia PIccolo and the singer Ornella Vanoni in the character role of a prostitute. * Riuscir√† il cav.

First Italian fantastic thriller, on the example of French productions as Belphegor. An English scholar, in Rome for a conference, meets the ghost of a woman loved in a previous life and is involved in the chase for a powerful talisman. Thanks to a suggestive direction and a well-conceived plot, the miniseries gets at an unexpected success (fifteen millions viewers) and becomes in the years a cult object. * Vita di Leonardo (The life of Leonardo da Vinci) ‚Äì in five episodes; by Renato Castellani; with Philippe Leroy in the title role. Docudrama highly spectacular (the lost fresco The battle of Anghiari is reconstructed for the shooting) but historically very accurate. An original idea is the insertion, in the Renaissance scene, of a teller modernly dressed (Giulio Bosetti) expressing the views of the author about the great artist. * Come un uragano (Like an hurricane) ‚Äì mystery in five episodes; by Silverio Blasi, from Francis Durbridge's Bat out of hell, with Alberto Lupo, Delia Boccardo and Corrado Pani.

At least 29 people were killed and dozens more were trapped due to the collapse. Location The mine collapse occurred at an illegal communal gold mine in Bakan village, Lolayan subdistrict, Bolaang Mongondow, North Sulawesi. The land where the mine is located is part of a concession belonging to J Resources Asia Pacific, which operates a site in the area. According to the company's management, the illegal mine had only been relatively crowded in the past few months leading to the event. Previously, in June 2018, the same mine had experienced a smaller landslide due to heavy rainfall, which killed 5 miners. Collapse The collapse occurred around 20:30 WITA (12:30 GMT) on February 26, while tens of locals were actively mining at the site. According to accounts from rescued miners, the collapse happened due to a fracturing of the support structures of the mineshafts. The number of people trapped in the mineshafts according to eyewitnesses varied, reaching up to more than 100 miners. Rescue Around 140 personnel from multiple agencies were involved in the evacuation process. Early in the evacuation process, rescuers reported hearing voices of the miners who were still trapped in the shafts, with pictures of hands reaching out through small gaps in the rocks. Due to fears of triggering further landslides, in addition to the difficult and unstable terrain, rescuers initially opted to not utilize available heavy equipment and delivered drinking water to allow the miners to survive longer. Later, on 1 March, the manual rescue was halted in favor of preparing the use of heavier equipment. As of 1 March, 8 miners had been confirmed dead and 20 had been evacuated alive from the collapsed mine. The injured survivors were brought to a hospital at Kotamobagu for treatment. On 2 March, there were believed to be over 30 miners still trapped inside the mines. By 3 March, the death toll was updated to 9 dead, with the still-to-be-found victims' families barred from the mine location to ease the evacuation. Further searches found 20 bodies of miners buried within the site. Reactions The provincial government of North Sulawesi remarked that the local governments had made plans to certify the communal mines to ensure compliance with safety regulations, and that the collapsed mine would not be closed, but turned into a legal mine. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources responded by sending inspectors to the mine, who were also to aid in the evacuations.

Eddie was originally portrayed by Enzo‚Äôs father, Moose; Enzo was one of a few puppies bred specifically as possible replacements for Moose, as it became clear that Frasier was a hit and would enjoy a long run. A daughter, Miko, was considered but never grew large enough (she was given to a technician); a son, Moosie, lived with Peri Gilpin, the actress who played Roz Doyle. Enzo, born to mother Chelsea Marvin (also a Jack Russell), was a closer match and turned out to have unusually similar facial markings to his father. Later in the series, he was used as a stunt double to perform the more physically challenging tricks for his aging father. Enzo and Moose took turns playing the role after the eighth season. Enzo was also used as one of the puppies that \\"Eddie\\" had fathered during the show. Off the set, trainer Mathilde de Cagny has stated that Moose and Enzo's relationship was so bad that the two \\"could not stand to be in the same room together.\\" Enzo was cast as Skip in the feature film My Dog Skip. Moose played the older Skip in a few scenes. His trainer and several actors have commented on Enzo‚Äôs skill and trainability; he performed tricks and portrayed a wide variety of emotions.

It traces its origins to the anthropology courses offered at the then Oxford Polytechnic in the 1970s and developed into a globally recognised centre for primate conservation. History Oxford Brookes University began as the Oxford School of Art in 1865; as early as 1975 primatology and primate evolution was taught as part of the anthropology programme which was also available to biology and psychology students. Research in these early days had a strong focus on ecology and behaviour in particular of nocturnal primates. In 2000 the MSc in Primate Conservation was established, allowing students from all over the world to focus on the conservation of primates. In 2008 it was the recipient of the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education. Areas of research Over 60% of the non-human primates are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations. Taking a holistic view, research on primates and conservation at Oxford Brookes University centres on the primates themselves, the human that live side by side with primates, globalisation and its effect on primates, and newly emerging trends that have the potential to impede on the conservation of primates and their habitat. Research takes place both in area where primates occur naturally (Central and South America, Africa and Madagascar, Asia, Europe) as well as in captive settings. The programme has strong links with (primate) conservation programmes in various parts of the world, including Neotropical Primate Conservation , Entropica , Monitor Conservation Research Society (Monitor), Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation , Orangutan Information Centre and Project Anoulak Teaching programmes Primatology and conservation is taught as part of the BSc/BA in Anthropology and Biological Anthropology; BSc Animal Biology and Conservation; the postgraduate diploma in Anthropology; the MSc in Conservation Ecology; the MSc in Primate Conservation; the MRes in Primatology and Conservation.

Early life Delano was born in Dartmouth, Massachusetts on July 27, 1813 and grew up in Fairhaven. He was a son of Captain Warren Delano and Deborah Perry (n√©e Church) Delano. Among his siblings was brother Warren Delano Jr. After his mother's death in 1827, his father, who was involved in the New England sea trade, remarried to Elizabeth Adams, a widow of Captain Parker of the United States Navy. A descendant of Philip Delano (a Pilgrim who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621), Franklin's paternal grandparents were Ephraim Delano and Elisabeth (n√©e Cushman) Delano, and his maternal grandparents were Joseph Church and Deborah (n√©e Perry) Church. Through his brother Warren, Franklin was the uncle of Warren Delano IV, Frederic Adrian Delano, and Sara Delano Roosevelt (the mother of Delano's grand-nephew and namesake, Franklin Delano Roosevelt). Career Delano was involved, and partners, in a number of financial ventures, including shipping ventures, with his brothers Warren, Frederick, and Edward. In January 1839, he became a partner in the New York shipping firm of Grinnell, Minturn & Company. He served as U.S. Consul for Chile at New York, from 1840 until 1851, when he resigned that office and also retired as an active partner in Grinnell, Minturn & Co. After his marriage, Delano joined his father-in-law in the Astor family business, located on Pearl Street in New York City, and assisted in control the large piece of property in New York City which his wife had inherited. After his retirement in 1851, Delano and his wife traveled to Europe, and later, spent much of their time in Italy and Monte Carlo. In the 1850s, Delano, along with his brother Warren and Asa Packer (the builder of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and founder of Lehigh University), headed a land company that purchased several thousand acres and established the town of Delano, Pennsylvania. Delano also served as the company president of the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad, the largest railroad in Alabama, due to the Astor family's ownership of a large block of stock. The Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad was formed by the consolidation of Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Co. (incorporated in 1848), the Georgia and Alabama Rail Road Co. (incorporated in 1854), and the Dalton and Jacksonville Railroad Co. (incorporated in 1854) on August 6, 1866.Interstate Commerce Commission, Southern Ry. Co., Volume 37, Interstate Commerce Commission Valuation Reports, November 6, 1931. Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1932. pp. 213-214. Delano handed over day-to-day management of the railroad to Captain E. G. Barney. Personal life In September 1844, Delano was married to heiress Laura Eugenia Astor. Laura was a daughter of William Backhouse Astor Sr. and Margaret (n√©e Armstrong) Astor, and a sister, among others, of John Jacob Astor III and William Backhouse Astor Jr. (husband of the Mrs. Astor). Reportedly, Laura was the favorite granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, the founding Astor family patriarch who was America's first millionaire who died in 1848, four years after their marriage. Her maternal grandparents were John Armstrong Jr. (a U.S. Senator, U.S. Minister to France under Thomas Jefferson and U.S. Secretary of War under James Madison) and Alida (n√©e Livingston) Armstrong. In New York City, the Delano's lived at 190 Madison Avenue, and where he was a member of the Union Club (which he joined in 1839, three years after its founding in 1836), the Knickerbocker Club, the Century Club, the New-England Society, ad the American Geographic Society. Around 1890, due to failing health, Delano moved abroad and after traveling for a year, took up residence in Monte Carlo, Monaco, where he died on December 23, 1893. His widow died in 1902. Steen Valetje As a wedding gift, Laura's father gifted the couple the southernmost 100 acres of his Rokeby estate. The estate came to be known as \\"Steen Valetje\\" (which means \\"little stone valley\\" in Dutch). The Tuscan-style mansion, designed by Frank Wills, was completed in 1851. In 1866 William Astor Sr. conveyed the adjoining 142 acres of Rokeby to his son, Henry. Henry Astor built a brick dwelling on this land, but in 1873 conveyed the property to Laura, thus expanding \\"Steen Valetje\\". A gatehouse, designed by Walter Schickles & Co. was added in 1874.\\"Atalanta/Steen Valetje/Mandara\\", Gatehouses of the Hudson River Historic District The mansion was expanded in 1881 by architect Thomas Stent. The Astors and the Delanos commissioned German born landscape gardener Hans Jacob Ehlers to improve the grounds at Rokeby and Steen Valetje. Ehlers converted an old farm track into a woodland path called the Poet's Walk in honor of poets Washington Irving and Fitz-Greene Halleck, who are said to have strolled there. It is now Poets' Walk Park, managed by the not-for-profit Scenic Hudson.\\"Poet's Walk Park\\", Scenic Hudson As Delano and his wife both died childless, he left Steen Valetje to his nephew, coal baron Warren Delano IV. Warren IV was very involved in horse breeding, with over sixty saddle, driving, and draft horses at his stables at \\"Steen Valetje\\". He died September 9, 1920, when, while picking up a trunk at the Barrytown Train Station, his carriage horse was frightened by an approaching northbound New York Central express, and dashed onto the tracks with the buggy carrying Delano, who was killed instantly. His funeral was held at \\"Steen Valetje\\" and was attended by his nephew Franklin, then the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Jennie Walters Delano, died two years later in 1922. Their son Lyman inherited \\"Steen Valetje\\" and his family kept the home until 1966 when it was sold.

After studying medicine, she had provided emergency services during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In 1889, she created the Ligue de l'Affranchissement des femmes (League of Women's Enfranchisement) calling for women to be added to the electoral lists.  Early life and education  Born in Paris on 30 September 1846, Marie Rose de Valsayre was the daughter of parents who had been ruined by the French Revolution. After her father had emigrated to the United States, she was brought up by her mother. She studied music, first under her mother's guidance, later in the hands of professional tutors. By the time she was 13, she was a competent violinist and was beginning to compose pieces for piano. Unusually for her day, she also studied medicine, allowing her to serve as a nurse in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Professional life Asti√© stood out as a woman who was unwilling to accept the conventions of the times. She rode a bicycle and dressed as a man. As Jehan des Etrivi√®res, in 1882 she published Les Amazones du si√®cle, ridiculing a number of feminists including Hubertine Auclert, Eug√©nie Potoni√©-Pierre and L√©onie Rouzade. From 1885, she became a critic on literature and education for La Citoyenne. Under the pen name Jean Mis√®re, she wrote the patriotic Le Retour de l'exil√©, telling the story of a Parisian soldier returning from Sedan. As early as 1880, she began work on a number of feminist issues, including an attempt to overturn legislation preventing women from wearing trousers. In 1886, she sparked a media controversy by duelling another woman, an American, sparked by a debate regarding whether French women doctors or American women doctors were superior. France won the duel, leaving the American, Miss Shelby, slightly injured. This established her, notoriously, as a fencer and duellist. While duels were not uncommon, they were a tradition only of men. Yet Asti√© went on to establish a women's fencing association. In 1887, as a delegate for Le Suffrage des femmes, at the congress of the Union f√©d√©rative du centre, together with Marie Bonnevial she presented a resolution titled \\"√Ä travail √©gal, salaire √©gal\\" (For equal work, equal pay). On 1 July 1887, she sent a petition to the Deputies and the Police Prefecture requesting repeal of the ordinance of 1800, which prevented women from wearing trousers.Henry Cossira, \\"Lorsque les femmes s‚Äôhabillent en hommes\\", in Le Monde illustr√© [ archive ] available on Gallica (in French)Laure Cometti, \\"Figures du f√©minisme: Le combat d'Asti√© pour autoriser les femmes √† porter le pantalon au XIX√®me si√®cle\\", 20 minutes, 19 July, 2018, (read online archive; in French) According to her, bulky women's clothes of the time condemned women to accidents and sometimes death. Her several attempts failed. In 1889, she ran as a candidate in the municipal elections, and founded the Ligue socialiste des femmes (the Socialist League of Women) and then, in the summer of 1890, the Ligue de l'Affranchissement des femmes (League of Women's Enfranchisement). It set out to fight \\"all injustices for which women are victimes in all classes of society\\" and had radical demands: equal pay, access for women to all studies and professions, and women's suffrage. At a well attended public meeting of the League on 3 February 1891, a motion was adopted calling on all theatre directors and newspaper and journal editors to ensure that women's salaries were equal to those for men on the basis of same work, same pay. In 1892, under the pseudonym \\"la m√®re Marthe\\", she published L'Aisance par l'√©conomie, a practical guide for intelligent working housewives. The same year, with the support of the 6th arrondissement of Paris, she clubbed together with other groups of feminists to establish the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise des soci√©t√©s f√´ministes. From 1897 to 1901, she directed a newspaper, that she had created, and published many books under the pseudonym Jehan des Etrivi√®res until her death in 1939.Christine Bard, Une histoire politique du pantalon, Paris, √©ditions du Seuil, 2010 (in French)Brimborion, \\"Le Droit aux bretelles\\", in Gil Blas [ archive ] available on Gallica (in French)Jean Frollo, \\"Petit Parisien\\", in La Revue des journaux et des livres [ archive ] available on Gallica (in French)  See also  * Feminism in France References Category:1846 births Category:1939 deaths Category:French feminists Category:French suffragists Category:French nurses Category:French violinists Category:French composers Category:People from Paris Category:Socialist feminists ","title":"Marie-Rose Asti√© de Valsayre"},{"id":"60098358","text":"Rose Stone Star () is a 2020 Italian drama film directed by Marcello Sannino.

The car is an update to the 488 with notable exterior and performance changes. It was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show.  Specifications and performance  F8 Tributo at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show The F8 Tributo uses the same engine from the 488 Pista, a 3.9 L twin- turbocharged V8 engine which has a power output of and of torque, making it the most powerful conventional V8-powered Ferrari produced to date. Specific intake plenums and manifolds with optimised fluid-dynamics improve the combustion efficiency of the engine, thanks to the reduction of the temperature of the air in the cylinder, which also helps boost power. The increase in performance is provided in a more reactive way thanks to lightening solutions on the rotating masses, such as the F1 derived titanium connecting rods. The exhaust layout and the Inconel manifolds have been completely modified up to the terminals. The F8 Tributo also uses turbo rev sensors, developed in the 488 Challenge, to maximise the efficiency of the turbochargers based on the demand for power from the pedal. The transmission is a 7-speed dual clutch automatic unit with improved gear ratios. Several new software features are installed on the F8 which are controlled via the manettino dial on the steering wheel. The car is equipped with Ferrari's latest Side Slip Angle Control traction- and stability-control program. Additionally, the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer, an electronic program for managing drifts, can now be used in the Race drive mode. Claimed manufacturer performance for the F8 Tributo is in 2.9 seconds, in 7.6 seconds, with a top speed of . Ferrari also stated that the Tributo's downforce has been increased by 15 percent as compared to the 488 GTB. Design Rear view The front of the car is characterised by the S-Duct (originally featured on the 488 Pista) around which the entire front end of the car has been redesigned, with additional air intakes above the headlights. The front is completed by side aerodynamic intakes which are integrated into the shape of the bumper and feature two aerodynamic side splitters in black. The radiator packs are tilted towards the rear, using a flat undertray to channel the hot air and minimise the thermal interaction with the flows inside the wheel arch. The car also features quad taillamps, a feature that was last seen in the V8 lineage on the F430. At the rear, it sports a louvered clear engine cover made from lightweight Lexan which pays homage to the F40 and a wrap-around rear spoiler inspired by the 308 GTB, with additional air intakes on either side. Interior The interior has received updates as well: the dashboard, instrument housing, and door panels are new. The two-tone colour scheme seen on the 488 has also been replaced. An 8.5 inch passenger touchscreen display is also standard as a part of the HMI (Human Machine Interface). The dash now incorporates an aluminium sail panel supporting the central satellite navigation system and continuing into the dash itself. Variants F8 Spider The F8 Spider is an open-top variant of the F8 Tributo with a folding hardtop as seen on its predecessors. The top takes 14 seconds for operation and can be operated with speeds up to . The F8 Spider features large air intakes on its rear haunches, moved rearward compared to the ones in the 488 Spider for improved airflow to the engine. The Spider's drivetrain is shared with the Tributo. The engine has a lighter crankshaft, flywheel, and connecting rods and weighs nearly less than the engine in the 488 Spider. Performance figures include acceleration from 0‚Äì100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds and from 0‚Äì200 km/h (124 mph) in 8.2 seconds. Top speed is unchanged from the coup√© at 340 km/h (211 mph). Dry weight of the Spider is . The boot capacity allows for 200 litres of luggage space.

Developers of this theory include Michael Shanks, Mike Pearson and Julian Thomas who in the 1990s at University of Wales, Lampeter began formulating concepts which view the social aspect of performance along with the artistic nature of theatre together through an interdisciplinary lens as \\"an integrated approach to recording, writing and illustrating the material past\\" thereby marrying the academic with the artistic. Performance archaeology has further expanded in the last decade upon the theories of presence. Geoff Bailey states that \\"because we believe that the present is known or knowable better than the past, we must seek our inspiration in studies of present phenomena and our concepts and theories from authorities on the present.\\" Michael Shanks along with Ian Hodder, Christopher Witmore, Gabriella Giannachi and Nick Kaye have recently expanded the theory further by calling for cooperation within the humanities and studying transdisciplinary research from archaeologists who are encouraged to become storytellers in order to more diversely analyze the engagement of the actor, the audience, the things and the space in which they perform by using an 'ecology of practices'.Witmore, C. and M. Shanks, 2013. Archaeology. An Ecology of Practices. In Rathje, W.L., M. Shanks, and C. Witmore (eds.) 2013. Archaeology in the Making: Conversations through a discipline. Routledge.Hodder, Ian. (ed.) 2012. Archaeological Theory Today. Second Edition. Polity Press. The theory of performance archaeology aims to give researchers a multi temporal link to the antiquated through studying the processual nature of \\"performance of presence\\" which is entangled within the 'multipleness' of time. Echoing theories posited by Martin Heidegger, the processual and temporal natures of performance are phenomenologically entwined with the experiences of the performers and audience. Stories are preserved by memory through performance. These performances can be seen both in the archaeological record as well in modern enactments or rituals. The landscape itself is an integral portion of performance memory. Performance archaeology sets itself apart from performance history by directing focus not toward the past itself but instead toward what has become of the past by taking an ethnoarchaeological approach of analyzing the 'archaeology of present' cultures which allows for a richer interpretation of past performance. Performance archaeology takes a cross-disciplinary approach with 'social archaeology' to studying the things, narratives or artifacts, that remain of ancient theatre, music, dance, art history and oral tradition in order to 'model the past'. The following examples illustrate components that might aptly demonstrate aspects of performance archaeology.  Oral Cultures  Oral cultures lacking text experience performance through epic poetry, storytelling and ritual passed down and circulated by elders, shamans and storytellers. Performance archaeology joins these experiences with material objects and geographic as well as architectural locales in order to analyze the archaic. Oral tradition utilizes bards and griots as singers of stories which are set to music in order to better retain the memory of their tales through song. 197x197px  Ancient Percussion Instruments (Idiophones)  Ancient idiophones were instruments intended to \\"support man's natural feeling for dance and rhythm\\" and included clappers, scrapers, rattles, sistra, cymbals and bells and have been found in both ancient Mesopotamia as well as ancient Egypt. The sistra has been linked to ancient performances associated with the goddesses Bastet, Sekhmet, and Hathor and were used in ceremonies for warding off evil spirits.  Ancient Drums (Membranophones)  Drums are prevalent among the Sumerians, Babylonian and Hittites, but rarely found among the Egyptians. Drumming with sticks was a technique not introduced into Mesopotamia or Egypt until the later Roman invasion in the 1st century CE.  Ancient Wind Instruments (Aerophones)  Flutes, oboes, horns, trumpets and pan pipes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt while clarinets are indigenous to Egypt alone where they may have also been called by the Arabic zummara. The organ originated in 3rd century BCE Alexandrian Egypt by fusing a pan pipe with a keyboard. 250x250px  Ancient Stringed Instruments (Chordophones)  Lyres of Ur have been found throughout what is modern-day Iraq at the Royal Cemetery at Ur \\"perhaps intended to provide melodic accompaniment for the dead\\" that date back to the 3rd millennium BCE.Schauensee, Maude De. \\"The Boat-Shaped Lyre: Restudy of a Unique Musical Instrument from Ur.\\" Expedition: The Magazine of the University of Pennsylvania 40.2 (1998): 20-28. Web. Sumerian lyres tend to be in the shape of an animal's head with the supporting sides mimicking animal horns. In Ancient Greece a lyre made of a tortoise shell was referred to as a chelys can be found on hydriai pots dating back as far as the 8th century BCE. These instruments played a daily role in child-related activities as well as during multiple performances such as symposia, weddings and komoi and were related to the god Hermes as referenced by Homer. Lyres were not indigenous to Egypt and did not become popular until centuries after being introduced by a Syrian nomad. Harps have been linked to ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian cultures, but were most popular in Egypt.  Ancient Theatrical Performance   Ancient Egypt  The earliest form of theatre was thought to have begun as early as the 19th century BCE in Abydos, Egypt in religious ceremonies known as 'Passion Plays' whereby priests annually and ritually reenacted the Osiris myth in performances that traveled with Osiris' sacred barque on a roundtrip journey from his temple to his tomb and back. This processional festival brought travelers from the entirety of Egypt. Those who could afford to erected monuments to themselves along the route so that even in the afterlife they would still be able to participate in the festival. Performance in Egypt persisted for another millennia as described by the Rhind mortuary papyri which records the burial ceremonies of Menthesuphis and his wife who perished circa 9 BCE entailing a \\"dramatic performance, with the priests assuming the roles of the gods.\\" In these instances ritual is enacted through performance in order to join the realms of the living with the dead and also to create a space where the worlds of the living and dead could simultaneously merge as \\"this complex festival culture connect(s) heaven, the earth, and the world of the dead\\". Recurring festival performances were held annually or seasonally. As festival culture emerged, so too did the ritual performances or 'festival plays' that served the purpose of both associating the ruling king with the gods as exemplified in the Luxor feast which was annually performed as a \\"cultic affirmation of the king as son of god (Amun)\\", as well as during the Festival of Valley when the king associated himself with his forefathers in the cult of the 'ancestor gods' in order to \\"assure himself of their blessings as the legitimate son of his bodily ancestors\\". Traces of the Osiris Myth as performance archaeology have endured and can be seen in modern stories such as Hamlet and The Lion King.  India  In Classical India, theatre was used as a way to both provide a source of entertainment as well as to relay moral advice from their epic poetry. The Natya Shastra is a Sanskrit text dating back to the 5th century describing the performing arts. Episodes of the performances are depicted in sixty-two reliefs found within Prambanan temple located in Java. Music, dance and theatre were all closely interwoven within both the Hindu and Buddhist cultures. A scene from kabuki stage (1885?)  Japan  Kabuki  Greece  Ancient Greek tragedy has been linked to rituals stemming from the cult of Cult of Dionysus.  Ancient Dance  Tomb of the Dancers, wall painting. 17th Dynasty, Thebes. Musicians and Dancers played important roles in ancient Egyptian performance. Elite women in ancient Egypt adorned their hips with trinkets including not only aesthetically pleasing ornamental gold, shells and jewels, but also noise- making trinkets that were thought to both ward off evil spirits and invoke the goddess Hathor and appeal to her sexual nature in order to promote fertility. Modern belly dance is thus a derivative of this older Egyptian practice. Through the archaeological record dancers can be seen in artwork such as the Tomb of the Dancers painting in Thebes. Procession of performers welcome child heir. Bonampak, Mexico. Violent war performances were reenacted in Mesoamerica by elaborately plumed war dancers. The representation of maize was personified by human/plant hybrid models which were utilized for ritual purposes. Dramatic enactments of this nature are presumed to have been used for the purpose of sympathetic magic in order to win in battle in the former instance, as well as to resurrect the spirit of the vegetation each Spring in the latter. A theatrical performance was reconstructed in Guatemala in 1543 CE that incorporated music along with the Dance of Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the Maya Hero Twins, which portrayed their descent into and resurrection from Xibalba. Theatrical performances also frequently incorporated both music and dance into a procession as exemplified on limestone murals found in Bonampak, Mexico. Here musicians playing drums, rattles and turtle shells accompany actors wearing bizarre costumes in an elaborate ceremony welcoming a child heir to the throne. Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions show people posed in \\"highly- stylized gestures...explicitly labeled in accompanying text as 'dance'\\" and are thought of as a form of sign language. Instruments used in Maya culture such as horns, turtle shells, drums and rattles can be found in their visual art. Alessandra Lopez y Royo analogizes dance to poetry describing the karanas, or dance movements artistically portrayed on the temple walls, as the 'sentences' left for us to re-embody the 'vocabulary' of the dance. 'Contemporary dance' of Indian performance arts on the other hand is a \\"distinct genre\\" and can be interpreted as the product of Western or 'non- traditional' influence.

He was sixteen years old when his apprenticeship as a stone carver was curtailed due to the death of his grandfather who was training him. He was versatile enough to turn his hand to wood carving, decorative ceiling work, stained glass and marble sculpture besides stone carving, so that from around the age of twenty-one years he was able to maintain a stoneyard and studio in Cookridge Street, Leeds, at least until 1891. He was generally known during his lifetime as a monumental mason. He is mainly known today in Leeds for his wooden Jacquemart figures of Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, Richard the Lionheart and the swineherd Gurth, which strike the hours on the Ivanhoe clock at one end of Thornton's Arcade in Briggate. He is also known for his figure of Old Father Time on the Tempus Fugit clock on the Time Ball Buildings, Leeds.

At this yard he was permitted to concentrate on carving. His grandfather's death in 1847 curtailed his apprenticeship at the age of 16, and he was back with his parents in Farsley by 1851, when he was 19 years old and already calling himself a \\"stone carver and cutter.\\" He plied his trade as a \\"sculptor, stone and marble mason and monumental mason\\" until at least 1891, although he tended to call himself simply a stone carver or sculptor. In 1892 Appleyard appeared as a witness, on behalf of architect E.W. Lockwood of Huddersfield, in a Court case brought by sculptor Samuel Auty for payment for some carving work. A comment from this case confirms that stones for architectural carving were roughed out by masons at ground level, and that the carving was completed when the stones were in situ on the building: \\"The stone for the gargoyles [was] roughened into shape,\\" then later \\"he could not work in such an exposed position as that in which the stone had in the meantime been placed, but that when the weather was better he would finish the work.\\" The Beckett Street Cemetery record keeper knew him as a monumental mason. By 1871 he had a workshop producing sculpture and designs in 16‚Äì18 Cookridge Street, Leeds, next door to architect George Corson, and he remained there as a monumental mason until at least 1891.McCorquodale & Co.'s Topographical and Commercial Directory of Leeds and Neighbourhood, 1876, p. 436Kelly's Directory of Leeds and Neighbourhood, 1881, p. 416Slater's Royal National Commercial Directory of the West Riding of Yorkshire, 1891, p. 331 Appleyard was also in his later years a teacher of cabinet-making at the Leeds Institute.

Old Father Time figure, Time Ball Buildings, Leeds, after 1872 This is part of a Grade II* listed building. Appleyard executed the sculpture on top of Dyson's cantilevered Tempus Fugit clock, which is suspended from the front of the Time Ball Buildings, Leeds. Although the clock is dated 1865, the figure of Chronos or Old Father Time above the clock was created by Appleyard after Dyson bought the building in 1872. * Old Father Time Tempus Fugit (9a).jpg|Close-up Old Father Time Tempus Fugit (11).JPG|Old Father Time, 1872 Old Father Time Tempus Fugit (1).JPG|Silhouette St Bartholomew's Church, Armley, Leeds, 1872‚Äì1877 Design for reredos, St Bartholomew's 1874 St Bartholomew's, Armley, Leeds, was founded in 1872, and consecrated in 1877. The Caen stone reredos of this church erected in 1877 has alabaster carvings, representing the Magi, crucifixion and Old Testament figures. Appleyard was present at the consecration on 24 August 1877, listed alongside the architects Henry Walker and Joseph Athron who designed the building and reredos. Since no other stone carver is credited for this work, it is reasonable to suppose that it could be the work of Appleyard. The pulpit is of alabaster and marble, designed by architect Thomas Armfield after the pulpit at the shrine of Sebaldus in St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremberg. It was carved originally by Mawer and Ingle for the former St Bartholomew's Church, on the occasion of its 1861 restoration, then moved together with the font to the new building after the consecration. Decorative ceilings, Grand Theatre, Leeds, 1877‚Äì1878 The Grand Theatre in Upper Briggate, Leeds, is a Grade II* listed building, designed by George Corson and his chief assistant James Robinson Watson, and opened in November 1878, having taken \\"thirteen months to build.\\" It originally consisted of a theatre and assembly rooms, with shops in between. The interiors have been much changed, especially in the 1930s. Appleyard carried out ceiling work inside this combination building, contracted by J. Pollard of Bond Street. The auditorium has a \\"ribbed and domed ceiling with central chandelier and plaster pendentives,\\" and the former assembly room (now the Opera North rehearsal room) has a \\"segmental-arched ceiling with ribs and panels decorated with reliefs of fruit and flowers.\\" Describing the auditorium in 1878, The Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer said: \\"The roof, lighted by one great chandelier, presents a very rich appearance.\\" \\"The prevailing colour of the decorations (was) crimson and gold.\\" Grand Theatre (6a).jpg|Part of auditorium ceiling of Grand Theatre, 1878 Ivanhoe Clock, Thornton's Arcade, Leeds, 1877‚Äì1878 Thornton's Arcade is a Grade II listed building, designed by George Smith, and located between Lands Lane and Briggate in Leeds, West Yorkshire. It was in the planning stage in 1875, approved in 1877 and completed in 1878. The Ivanhoe Clock is a large, automated, public timepiece manufactured by Potts of Leeds between 1877 and 1878 to strike on the hour and each quarter. Appleyard created the four life-sized, wooden, Jacquemart figures of Richard I, Friar Tuck, Robin Hood and the swineherd Gurth. The figures appear to strike the bells, which are actually hit by hammers hidden behind the display. The Arcade's founder Charles Thornton already owned the music hall which later became the City Varieties, so these pantomime figures are in keeping with his showmanship. The clock was once manually wound, but was automated in 1955, and was restored in 1997. The wooden female head, inside and above the door opposite the clock, is a likeness of Gainsborough's Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. It is likely to be the work of Appleyard because it is in the same theatrical style as the clock figures, it is worked in the same materials, and is also painted. It was placed here as a topical subject because Gainsborough's portrait painting was stolen in 1877 while the arcade was under construction.

It is a rotunda-shaped drinking fountain in Roundhay Park, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. Appleyard executed the carving on this domed fountain, which was donated by the founder of Roundhay Park, Sir John Barran. The fountain was opened for public use on Monday 3 April 1882. Around the inside of the dome is the inscription: \\"Presented to the Leeds Corporation by John Barran, M.P., April 3rd 1882.\\" As a drinking fountain, the structure is no longer functional. It originally had \\"ornate bronze vases through which the water issues, to the taps, the drinking cups, and their connections, all being very pretty.

The new church was built on the eastern side on the original Lupton family's Congregational Chapel, built in 1870. The new church had a 70-foot tower with a clock by Pearce & Sons; on each angle was a turret with an octagonal crocketed pinnacle. It had an octagonal nave with arcading and clerestory. \\"The pulpit and communion rails, of oak, are beautifully carved.\\" J. W. Appleyard was credited as one of the contractors, but it is not known whether he carved wood or stone here. At some point the clock was replaced by one by Potts of Leeds, which had originally been installed in Wellington Station, Leeds, in 1916. The building was deconsecrated in 1952 and became the Royal Air Force Association Club, The Old Central Hebrew Congregational Synagogue, then finally a Sikh temple. The original 1870 Chapel was damaged by fire in 2005 and is now derelict. Memorial to J.F. Longrigg, St Paul's, Shipley, 1890 This wall memorial to the Rev. John Fallowfield Longrigg MA, who died 8 September 1888, was produced in Appleyard's stoneyard. It is in St Paul's Church, Kirkgate, Shipley, West Yorkshire, a Grade II listed building, and consists of a white marble tablet on a slab of empress red marble which was originally \\"on the west wall, to the right of the central doorway, of St Paul's Church.\\" It is now on the left side of the door. Longrigg had initiated a young men's class during his curacy, and this group organised the funding by subscription of the tablet. Longrigg also initiated the poor children's annual Christmas dinner at Shipley, and this work continued for many years after he left St Paul's. The dedication is to the \\"rarest devotion to duty\\" by Longrigg, who was curate of St Paul's 1885‚Äì1887, after which he was vicar of Emmanuel Church in Woodhouse Lane, Leeds from November 1887. He died suddenly in September of the following year.

It is on the south-west side of Kirkgate (number 110) where it meets Vicar lane. It faces the south-west corner of Kirkgate Market. It was designed by William Bakewell (1839‚Äì1925) of Leeds at a cost of ¬£4,500, with carving by J.W. Appleyard. Work was begun in 1890. The walls of the banking hall were lined with light-veined Italian marble, the floor was of mosaic, the fittings included a five-foot dado and were of solid American walnut, and the ceiling was \\"richly panelled.\\" The stone for the exterior came from the Morley and Idle quarries, and the building carries the arms of Leeds and London. Heating was \\"effected by hot air pipes disposed in coils throughout the building,\\" and there was a hydraulic lift. It was open for business in December 1891, but did not move into the new premises until February 1892. The Pevsner Guide cites \\"fine carving, including King Midas.\\" English Heritage says that above the pediment there is a \\"draped female statue flanked by animals, a lion and unicorn at corners,\\" however the statue is of a bearded man with donkey's ears; he is isolated, representing tragedy - and he has no crown.

The exterior is of \\"cleansed Bradford stone ... the frieze and pediment being carried by polished red granite columns. The architecture of the first and second floors is of a Corinthian order, having coupled columns, and the whole is crowned by richly carved frieze, cornice, and vase terminals.\\" The walls of the banking hall were originally lined with Burmantofts faience. The hall's furnishings were of half-polished oak with specially-designed brass fittings. The first and second floors were intended as offices, with their own strong room on each floor, and their own Bond Street entrance. There was also a \\"fine suite of offices\\" on the ground floor, with its own Park Row entrance. The opening of this building was delayed due to a major fire at the saw mill belonging to Nicholson & Son of Prospect Works, Crown Point Road, Leeds. \\"The preparation of the woodwork, some of it of a highly ornate and valuable character, such as carved screens and the like, was in an advanced stage; but none had left the premises.\\" This work, intended for the York City and County Bank, was destroyed by the fire.

The ship was bought by a Danish businessman in 1819 and it became the first steamship registered in Denmark. It spent most of its active years in Denmark operating between the cities of Copenhagen and Kiel. Broken up around 1843.  Under British colours  Caledonia was launched on April 27, 1815 at John Wood & Co. in Port Glasgow, near Glasgow. The paddle-wheeler had two steam engines, supplied by the Greenhead Foundry Company in Glasgow. The combined engine power was 36 nominal hp, corresponding to between 100 and 180 indicated hp. The original speed of the ship was between 6 and 8 knots. The registration papers from July 1816 listed a number of owners, cooperating via the Caledonia Steam Boat Company. Caledonia was initially used on the route between Glasgow and Helensburgh. The sources describing the vessel differ somewhat, especially regarding her size, engines and speed. Knud Klem stated that the machinery was from \\"Cook and Henry Bill\\", giving 28 HP. Paul Bell spells the machinery purveyor \\"Cook and Henry Bell\\" and also gives 28 HP. Specification of ownership and first service are taken from here. In July 1816, Caledonia embarked on the long journey from Glasgow to the Thames, where the vessel was employed on a service between London and Margate. This is the primary source, listing the first 20 steamships built on the Clyde (Caledonia is no. 13). Machine builder and specifications are taken from here. In May 1817 the Caledonia was bought by James Watt Jr (nephew of the inventor James Watt) and Matthew Robinson Boulton (son of Matthew Boulton). The new owners worked together as second generation of the engine factory of Boulton and Watt and they had plans to add ship engines to their production in Birmingham at Soho Manufactory. Watts and Boulton gradually replaced the machinery with their own products, and in order to test the endurance they took the Caledonia on a trip to Rotterdam and up the Rhine. The sidewheeler Defiance had gone as far as Cologne in June 1816, and the Caledonia reached Koblenz in November 1817. It had, however, been necessary to use draft horses on the final part, and when the owners asked the Kingdom of Prussia for a concession for a regular service, their request was refused. Caledonia spent the winter at Rotterdam, and more machine parts were delivered from England for installation. In the spring of 1818, the sidewheeler was back on the Thames, and James Watt Junior continued his experiments, among other things varying the number of paddles on each wheel. While this was happening, the Danish solicitor, and later diplomat, Steen Andersen Bille (1781-1860), had petitioned the Danish King for the exclusive concession for a steamship connection between Copenhagen and Kiel in Holstein (then a part of the Danish Monarchy). There were two other applicants for the concession, but both withdrew, and in October 1818 Bille's concession was confirmed. He wanted to buy the Caledonia, but at the time he worked as an administrator in the Danish West Indies, so the bankers Hambro and Son in Copenhagen (later Hambros Bank in London) took care of the purchase. Steen Bille's brother, the naval officer Michael Bille travelled to England, where he took over the Caledonia and led the ship to Denmark by the Eider Canal.  Under Danish colours  The Caledonia spent every Sunday in Copenhagen and used the day for scheduled pleasure cruises on the Sound. Detail from an 1824 painting by C.W. Eckersberg. The ship's arrival at Copenhagen in May 1819 attracted considerable attention. The owners started advertising at once, and an 1819 advertisement said, that Caledonia \\"departs Copenhagen for Kiel every Tuesday morning at precisely 5 and calls in (to receive or embark passengers) at Coster's Ferrypoint on M√∏n at 2 in the afternoon, Gaabense Ferrypoint on Falster at 4 in the afternoon, Banholm on Lolland at 6 in the afternoon and is then expected to arrive at Kiel on Wednesday morning at 8.\\" The route was only operated during the summer season and Caledonia made 14 round trips in 1819 and 22 in 1820. The low number in 1819 was partly due to lack of passengers - there was a lot of mistrust against the use of steam - so every other week the ship stayed in Copenhagen and small excursions were sailed from the city. This provided more passengers, especially after the King and Queen had tried it. In January 1822, Steen Bille sold the ship and the concession to the merchant L.N. Hvidt.In Danish: \\"afgaaer fra Kj√∏benhavn til Kiel hver Tirsdag morgen Kl. 5 pr√¶cise og anl√∏ber paa denne Tour (saavel for at modtage som lands√¶tte Passagerer) Costers F√¶rgested paa M√∏en Kl. 2 om Eftermiddagen, Gaabense F√¶rgested paa Falster Kl. 4 om Eftermiddagen, Banholm i Lolland Kl. 6 om Eftermiddagen og antages at ankomme til Kiel Onsdag morgen Kl. 8.\\" Steamships were very rare in Denmark in the 1820s, so it is most certainly the Caledonia in the sound between Zealand and M√∏n, in this 1829 painting by Frederik S√∏dring. Spells of bad weather would jeopardise the timetable. That happened for instance to Hans Christian Andersen, who set out on June 30, 1829 from Copenhagen to M√∏n. In a letter to Edvard Collin he gave an account of the journey with the Caledonia: > \\"The sea journey was very unlucky, although now that it is over, it does > amuse me. We had a bit of a storm and had to work our way through black and > foam-white waves. Everybody got ill; Mrs. B√ºlow thought we were going to > founder, and I - You know I have no trace of valour - I lay wrapped in a > blanket on the deck, staring with a pale face at the grey skies that emptied > themselves over us. - At last the captain announced that we would have to > stay out at sea the entire night; a comforting outlook. Only the following > morning did we arrive at Koster, where everything was in a state of > commotion, because the King was due to arrive.\\"Letter no. 51. From H.C. > Andersen to Edvard Collin, July 18, 1829 (in Danish) The ship was fitted with tarpaulins fore and aft, giving cover to the passengers. Below deck there was a special cabin for ladies, a larger cabin for other passengers and a pantry where the heat from the engines was used for cooking. Extra payment would give access to one of eight cabins, where passengers could sleep during the trip. The satirical magazines wrote about the Caledonia sickness, which was due to the fact that the steam driven ship did not have sails to catch the wind and stabilise the movement in the water, and popular slang named the vessel \\"Plaske-Marlene (Splashing Marlene)\\".\\"Ildskibet i Boml√∏bet\\", Jyllandsposten, 1. maj 1999 (in Danish) After 12 seasons of service, the Caledonia was replaced in 1830 by the larger Frederik 6. The importance of the Copenhagen-Kiel connection was further enhanced in 1832, when the railroad from Altona to Kiel was completed.Kieler Erinnerungstag: 24. April kiel.de (in German) The paddle-steamer was still used occasionally, and could be found in the advertised itiniaries until 1834, but after that she went unmentioned until Hvidt informed the authorities that she had been scrapped - in either 1841 or 1843. Caledonia proved to be an excellent investment for L.N. Hvidt. The museum director Knud Klem went through the books and established that Hvidt made around 43,000 Danish rigsdaler from her.

Plot summaries  The book is a compilation of thirteen short stories, set against the backdrop of the Partition of India in 1947. The stories portray the psychological effect of communal riots during partition. The stories have been written mainly as first person narratives, and some as third person narratives.  \\"No Forgiveness Necessary\\"  Rulda and Fattu are inmates at the Mental Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Their mental health conditions are treated successfully, they cannot be discharged as neither of their relatives arrives to pick them up. Iqbal Junaid Hussain, a doctor at the hospital's asylum has been tasked to prepare a list of all the Hindu and Sikh patients, for deporting them to India after the partition. He is shot down on his way out of the hospital during the riots. After three decades, Iqbal's son Asif visits Phagwara, to find out the reason for his father's murder. He learns that Ramneek Singh, the person who killed his father, was a soldier who wanted to avenge his son's murder by killing a Muslim, who happened to be Iqbal.  \\"Belly Button\\"  Prakash Singh Kohli visits Pakistan as a part of a caravan of Sikh pilgrims going to Nankana Sahib. Although he has a visa to visit only Lahore, he goes on to visit Gujranwala where he was born in August 1947. He meets Roshaan Bibi, a midwife who helped his mother during Prakash's birth, but could not do it properly due to the terror outside. As a result, Prakash ended up with an abnormal navel for life.  \\"Partitioning Madness\\"  This story is about the exchange of mental patients between India and Pakistan, three years after the partition. Rulda Singh tells his story to the medical superintendent Mohinder Singh and Prakash. The story ends with Prakash questioning the medical superintendent on how it was possible that more than half the patients who were to be sent to India died in the years after the partition and before the exchange. The hospital report said they died due to cholera.  \\"Sita's Bus\\"  Harpreet Cheema from Jullundur was married to Manjeet Cheema who owned transport buses in Sialkot. She starts working as a physical training instructor after her marriage, despite her mother-in-law's reluctance. The family plans to move to Gurdaspur where Manjeet's sister in married. Post partition, Gurdaspur was likely to be in India, while Sialkot was sure to be in Pakistan. Their house is set on fire during riots and she passes out. Harpreet wakes up and see that she is in a Muslim household and Murtaza has brought her to his home. By the end of the month, Harpreet agrees to convert to Islam and is renamed Firdaus. She marries Murtaza's brother Aslam and returns to her previous job. On hearing about a bangle-seller who may be looking for Harpreet Cheema, Aslam goes to meet his police inspector friend Farukh who tells them that both the governments have signed an agreement cancelling religious conversions and subsequent marriages. Local police forces have been involved and incentivised to recover such women. Farukh suggests for them to escape to Bhimber, which is in Azad Kashmir. When they both return to Sialkot, a government officer is waiting for them and Harpreet is taken to Jullunder where her first husband Manjeet will receive her in a few days. She is pregnant at that time and her fetus is aborted without her consent. She then boards the bus to Delhi and on being asked her name replies, 'Harpreet' and then says Agge pichhe kuchh nahi (Nothing before or after).  \\"The Diary of a Mental Hospital Intern\\"  An intern goes to visit the Mental Hospital in Ranchi for two months. There are two separate hospitals, one for Indians and another for Europeans. When the Sikh and Hindu patients from Lahore were brought to India, Punjabis were kept at the hospital in Amritsar and the rest were brought to Ranchi.  \\"Folie √† Deux\\"  A story of shared psychosis, \\"Folie √† Deux\\", is about a couple who move from Multan to Patiala in 1948. A year later the woman goes through a nervous breakdown and develops a psychotic belief that bearded Muslims threaten to cut off her breasts. The woman runs out and is found at the railway station a few hours later. She is taken to a local Muslim healer and fully recovers over the next few months. Over the next 20 years she goes on to give birth to three children and also endures the loss of her husband. But one day, she breaks down again and jumps over the roof to her death. A year later, her son starts having visions that people are trying to kill him and an ISI agent is after him. Another year later, his younger sister becomes delusional that their mother has been killed by a Muslim doctor. The story ends when the eldest sister enters Kala's clinic screaming and accusing him of being a psycho killer.  \\"The Mad Prophesier\\"  Doctor Prakash Kohli visits Lahore to meet his friend, doctor Asif Junaid Hussain. He meets some of his patients, including Haq, who physically resembles Amitabh Bachchan and falls ill every time Amitabh Bachchan is sick. One day, Prakash and Asif visit the Lahore Mental Hospital. Prakash meets Fattu who has been living there for forty years and has become known as a prophesier among politicians who believe he can successfully predict events such as the breaking away of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He has been trying to build a tunnel to connect the hospital with Amritsar Mental Hospital, so that he can meet Rulda who was relocated after the partition.  \\"Love During Armistice\\"  Prakash and his wife Jasmeet visit Kufri to meet a boy named Brij who is in love with Benazir Bhutto, whom he had seen once, when she was visiting Shimla for the Simla Agreement in 1972 with her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He writes letters to her, which are intercepted by a teacher, and regularly dreams about her. A year later, after Prakash has joined the Post Graduate Medical Institute, Chandigarh, Brij is admitted to the hospital for his illness. He has stopped writing to Benazir now as she is visiting frequently in dreams and they no longer need letters to communicate. After three consecutive nights at the hospital and not dreaming of Benazir, he absconds from the hospital. Two years later, Prakash encounters Brij's father while coming out from the Delhi Airport. He tells Prakash that an acquaintance met Brij in Ajmer Sharif the previous week. Although the person did not recognize Brij's face, he could tell it was Brij for sure because he had a tattoo on his arm which read \\"Brij Bhushan Bhutto\\".  \\"Refugees\\"  Prakash has two children now, Anhad and Antara. One day during the Punjab insurgency, Prakash is approached by a beggar who gives him an envelope with his name on it, containing a letter and two close-ups of Anhad and Antara and asking him to contribute forty lakh rupees within 15 days to the Free Homeland Army for the War of Independence. Prakash moves to England with his family but months later he is approached once again by someone from the Free Homeland Army who invites him back to Punjab and gives him a letter which is a well-preserved copy of the letter that was given to him the previous year.  \\"Smart Aleck\\"  En route to Rawalpindi from Lahore to attend a conference, Prakash meets Jaffer Hussain who was a Barrister-at-Law at the Lahore High Court. Prakash expresses his interest in the reallocation of mental patients after the Partition and Jaffer starts discussing a similar exchange of prisoners and how under-trial Muslim prisoners charged with serious offenses opted for Pakistan. Jaffer tells the story of one of his clients, Ali, who was charged with murder and hailed from Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh. In the end, we find out that Jaffer and Ali were in fact one person, Ram Avtar Mishra from Ayodhya who loved a Muslim girl named Mehrunnisa. He got a fake certificate saying that he had converted to Islam as there were high chances of getting acquitted in Pakistan due to lack of witnesses. Eventually, he was acquitted and he got a permit to visit India using a fake certificate that his mother was on the verge of death. He took the train to India but was stopped at the first station and told that the permit is no longer valid and now, he needs an Indian visa on a Pakistani passport to visit India.  \\"Three Passports\\"  Anhad Kohli, an Indian national, married a Pakistani woman named Siddique. Together they have a 3-year-old daughter named Sehrish who is a British citizen. The family plans to visit India for Diwali which is only about 3 weeks away. The visa officer tells Siddique that getting an invitation to a conference will increase her chances for getting the visa on time. Anhad asks a favor from his father Prakash who arranges for them to attend a conference in Jalandhar. Although Siddique gets a visa to visit only Jalandhar, she still goes to Chandigarh with Anhad and Sehrish to celebrate Diwali with Anhad's family.  \\"A Spy Named Gopal Punjabi\\"  Sami is a former ISI agent who lives in Rawalpindi with his family and tells the story of a spy named Gopal, a Punjabi, whose parents were killed during partition. He worked with the Intelligence Bureau of India and after working as a stenographer at the Indian High Commission in Pakistan, he worked on behalf of the Intelligence Bureau in Amritsar. He also joined the mental hospital and worked to identify Indian antecedents of mental patients who had strayed across the border and were returned to India. One day, he crossed the border to meet an informer but was apprehended by the Rangers. On being caught he acted like a mentally ill person and he was pushed back into India. On returning, he was disowned by the Intelligence Bureau. After numerous attempts to try and connect with the IB office, he got frustrated and crossed the border again and on being caught, he asked to meet an officer from ISI and then joined ISI. He became a legend in Pakistan and led many successful operations and was responsible for killing many RAW agents. Sami goes on to tell that Gopal Punjabi led a team to Bangladesh 4 years after it was formed and died during that operation. A year later while on his deathbed, Sami tells his wife Aalia that he himself is Gopal Punjabi.  \\"Rulda's Discharge\\"  Rulda is discharged from the Amritsar Mental Hospital in 1984 and is taken to Delhi to live with his nephew's family by one of his nephew's assistants. When they reach Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station, Delhi, the city is gripped in anti-Sikh riots. The assistant is killed by the mob and somehow Rulda manages to escapes the mob. He stops a taxi and asks the driver, \\"Is there a mental hospital in the city?\\"  Themes  As the title states, the book contains stories about partition and its effects on mental health. Partition is not an event of the past rather a phenomenon that haunts people even today. The stories deal with both the Partition of India in 1947 and the 1984 Punjab insurgency. The author connects these two events and says that, \\"It made me realise that this partition of minds on communal lines can happen again, as it has so many times in the past.\\"  Reception  The book received mostly positive reviews with many critics comparing the stories with Manto's famous short-story Toba Tek Singh. Amandeep Sandhu feels that author's profession as a psychiatrist positions him \\"to uncover the trauma and psychoses that Partition caused in us as nations and in Punjab as a society.\\" Farah Yameen from The Hindu Business Line, who reviewed the book thinking it was a novel and not a collection of short-stories, feels that the author has done injustice to his work and that he should have explored more on the question of hundreds of mental patients who died of cholera in asylums or how did the partition cause collective psychosis. She also complains about the clich√©d cover of the book which displays a silhouette of a man with a tunnel going through it. Ranjit Powar's review in The Tribune called the book a must read for those who should know what happened and those who still feel the phantom limb pain of Partition and have inherited the loss of unrequited relationships through a collective subconscious. Nirupama Dutt wrote in the Hindustan Times, \\"Psychiatrist Anirudh Kala's 'The Unsafe Asylum: Stories of Partition and Madness' in interlinked episodes explores the impact of Partition on mental health in both countries, and even of the future generations.\\" Sakoon Singh reviews the book in DNA thus, \\"In a new offering, Anirudh Kala in The Unsafe Asylum: Stories of Partition and Madness, amplifies the voice of purported \\"lunatics\\". The naivety of \\"the rear end of humanity\\" duly punctures the sophistry of arguments advocating Partition. The book comes from the space of an insider, Kala's empathy drives this history from below. Overall, a sage addition to the existing and growing corpus of partition writing.\\"  Citations References * Category:Indian short story collections Category:2018 short story collections ","title":"The Unsafe Asylum"},{"id":"60099038","text":"The Friedrichshafen FF.63 was a German experimental floatplane produced by Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen.

He was first elected in the March 2019 mayoral election as the joint Nation Alliance candidate of the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the ƒ∞Yƒ∞ Party, but served only from 17 April 2019 until 6 May 2019, when the election was annulled. He was then reelected in a renewed election on 23 June 2019.Istanbul election rerun won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan He had previously been the Mayor of Beylikd√ºz√º, a western district of Istanbul, between 2014 and 2019. ƒ∞mamoƒülu emerged as a dark horse candidate to be the Nation Alliance's joint candidate for Istanbul Mayor, overtaking more prominent contenders such as Muharrem ƒ∞nce, the CHP's 2018 presidential candidate. On the eve of the elections, ƒ∞mamoƒülu gained a narrow lead in the mayoral race, with initial results showing his lead to be around 23,000 votes. His lead was eventually cut to 13,729 after a series of recounts backed by the government. ƒ∞mamoƒülu was sworn in as Mayor of Istanbul on 17 April, following the conclusion of all recounts. On 6 May 2019, the Supreme Electoral Council convened and voted to annul the results of the mayoral election. Members of the Council accepted the Justice and Development Party's objection to the local election results in Istanbul with seven members voting in favor of calling a new election and four against. The election board also cancelled ƒ∞mamoƒülu's mayoral certificate. A new election took place on 23 June 2019 in which ƒ∞mamoƒülu was re-elected as the mayor by a margin of approximately 800,000 votes. He was sworn into office on 27 June 2019. Because of the scale of his victory, he has been called a possible candidate for the Turkish presidency in the next elections. Early life ƒ∞mamoƒülu was born in June 1970, in the town of Ak√ßaabat, west of the city Trabzon, in Turkey, to a religious family. During early childhood, he lived in the rural communities Cevizli and Yƒ±ldƒ±zlƒ±, southwest of Ak√ßaabat. He graduated from Trabzon High School, where he played amateur soccer and handball. In 1987 his family moved to Istanbul. He attended Istanbul University, and received a Bachelor's degree in business administration and a Master's degree in human resource management. Following his graduation, he joined his family's business in construction. In 1995, he married Dilek Kaya, and together they have three children. In 2002 he became a manager with Trabzonspor, and he was also a vice president of the Trabzonspor B.K. basketball team. Political career ƒ∞mamoƒülu joined the Republican People's Party (CHP) in 2008, and was elected as the head of the party's youth wing in 2009. On 16 September 2009, he was selected by the CHP as the president of party's local chapter in the Istanbul district of Beylikd√ºz√º. He was then reelected to this position on 8 March 2012, before resigning on 15 July 2013 to run for mayor of Beylikd√ºz√º. The election was held on 30 March 2014, as part of the 2014 Turkish local elections, and ƒ∞mamoƒülu won with 50.44% of the vote, defeating the incumbent AKP candidate Yusuf Uzun. Following the announcement of Istanbul Municipality Mayor Kadir Topba≈ü's resignation on 23 September 2017, ƒ∞mamoƒülu was nominated by the CHP to replace him. In the Istanbul Municipal Assembly election to fulfill the remainder of Topba≈ü's term, ƒ∞mamoƒülu lost to the AKP candidate Mevl√ºt Uysal after three rounds, by a mostly party-line vote of 125 to 179.  2019 mayoral elections  Ekrem ƒ∞mamoƒülu and his spouse Dilek during his June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election campaign in Silivri. The CHP again nominated ƒ∞mamoƒülu for the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election on 18 December 2018. Both the ƒ∞yi Party, which formed an alliance with the CHP, and Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) declined to nominate candidates, which may have increased support for ƒ∞mamoƒülu. In the run-up to the elections, his campaign received worldwide attention for its mild-mannered and unifying approach, resulting in a narrowing of opinion polls against his rival, People's Alliance candidate Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m. The election was held on 31 March 2019, with ƒ∞mamoƒülu defeating AK Party candidate Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m by roughly 25,000 votes according to the election day totals released by the Supreme Electoral Council. Following his upset victory in which the ruling AKP significantly outspent him and received more media coverage, ƒ∞mamoƒülu was called a rising star in Turkish politics and a potential candidate to challenge Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan in the 2023 Turkish presidential election. The AK Party disputed the election results on behalf of its candidate, alleging that invalid votes may have swayed the election, and erected large posters in the city proclaiming Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m as the election's winner. ƒ∞mamoƒülu, in turn, accused the AK Party of being \\"bad losers.\\" Following a government-backed recount, ƒ∞mamoƒülu's lead was reduced to roughly 16,000 votes. ƒ∞mamoƒülu was sworn in as Mayor of Istanbul on 17 April, 17 days after the election, following the conclusion of all recounts. His mayoral tenure came to an end when on 6 May 2019, the Supreme Electoral Council annulled the results of the election and removed him as Mayor of Istanbul. According to the YSK, the decision was taken because some presiding officers and polling staff were not civil servants. Turkish law stipulates they must be civil servants. However, many have called this action as a move to undo the will of the voters, who handed a narrow but fiercely contested victory to the opposition candidate. Ali Yerlikaya was named as the interim mayor by the Interior Ministry of Turkey on 7 May 2019. A new election was held on 23 June 2019, in which ƒ∞mamoƒülu was re-elected as the mayor of Istanbul. Following his second loss to ƒ∞mamoƒülu, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m conceded defeat and also congratulated ƒ∞mamoƒülu on his re-election as mayor of Istanbul. Erdoƒüan also congratulated ƒ∞mamoƒülu and acknowledged that he won the election. ƒ∞mamoƒülu was then sworn into office on 27 June 2019. The same day he also received his mayoral certificate for the second time.

The LPD Protocol Specification is documented in RFC 1179.RFC1179 Line Printer Daemon Protocol, August 1990, edited by L. McLaughlin III. LPD printing normally happens over port 515. * AppSocket, also known as Port 9100, RAW, JetDirect, or Windows TCPmon is a protocol that was developed by Tektronix. It is considered as 'the simplest, fastest, and generally the most reliable network protocol used for printers' though 'it also offers no security and is often an attack vector with printers'. AppSocket printing normally happens over port 9100. * The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an Internet protocol for communication between client devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) and printers (or print servers). IPP can run locally or over the Internet. Unlike other printing protocols, IPP also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a much more capable and secure printing mechanism than older ones. IPP is supported by over 98% of printers sold today. IPP printing normally happens over port 631. It is the default protocol in Android and iOS.  Generic protocols  These protocols put the printer as similar class to remote disks, scanners and multimedia devices. This is especially true for multi-function printers, that also produce image files (scans and faxes) and send them back through the network. * Telnet is based on simply transferring data safely to/from TCP ports that are now being used for printing purposes. This approach is sometimes called raw TCP/IP, Stream, or direct sockets printing. * Server Message Block (SMB) is an application-layer network protocol for file and printer sharing originally developed by IBM in the mid-80s. It is the default method used by Windows based computers to share files and printers Common Internet File System, Microsoft TechNet Library.  Wireless protocols  Wireless protocols is designed for wireless devices. This kinds of protocols is based on one kind of printing protocols plus Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) mechanisms. In this way, printers can be used by wireless devices seamlessly. Note that the printer itself is not necessary to be wirelessed. * AirPrint is a feature in Apple Inc.'s macOS and iOS operating systems for printing via a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), either directly to AirPrint-compatible printers, or to non- compatible shared printers by way of a computer running Microsoft Windows, Linux, or macOS. AirPrint is based on mDNS (Bonjour, more specifically) and Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). It was originally intended for iOS devices and connected via a Wi-Fi network only, and thus required a Wi-Fi access point. However, with the introduction of AirPrint to the macOS desktop platform in 2012, Macs connected to the network via ethernet connection could also print using the AirPrint protocol‚Äînot just those connected via Wi-Fi. * Mopria Alliance provides a protocol which is adopted by Android and available in Windows 10. It uses mDNS for service discovery and Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) for printing, just like AirPrint. * Windows devices use Web Services for Devices (WSD) for service discovery and Line Printer Daemon protocol (LPR) or JetDirect (RAW) for printing. Windows 10 also supports Mopria Alliance's way.  Internet protocols  The computer and the printer usually should locate in the same local area network (LAN) when use all of above protocols. Internet printing protocols is designed for Internet printing. * Google Cloud Print  See also  * Common Unix Printing System * System V printing system * Spooling  References   External links  * TCP/IP Printing Overview on Brooksnet website Category:Printing protocols Category:Computer printing ","title":"List of printing protocols"},{"id":"60099363","title":"2019 Indian Super League Final"},{"id":"60099369","text":"The Devario monticola, is a fish belonging to the minnow family (Cyprinidae).

The current main building was constructed for Melchior Grevenkop-Castenskiold in 1861-62 and later expanded with a new north wing by Gotfred Tvede in 1900-1901. History Early history The first known owner of H√∏rbygaard is Else Tuesen who ceded it to her son Niels Tuesen 1314. It was later passed to his sons Peder Nielsen and Karl Nielsen. It was then owned by multiple simultaneous owners as was common at the time until it was acquired by the Diocese of Roskilde in the first half of the 15th century. It was then managed as a fief. Mogens Godskesen (Bielke) was one of the Seignories (lensmann). Godskesen was in 1526 granted the estate for life. Frederik Reedtz Crown land Mogens Godskesen kept the estate after it was confiscated by the Crown after the Reformation in 1536 and he was also granted Dragsholm. In 1589, H√∏rbygaard was granted to Peder Reedtz and his descendants. He was therefore succeeded by his son Frederik Reedtz as lensmann of H√∏rbygaard. Frederik Reedtz's son, Steen Reedtz, who was deep in debt, breached his obligations as lensmann. This resulted in a lawsuit in which his heirs renounced their right to succeed him at H√∏rbygaard. Changing owners Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll, a medical doctor and botanist, who was born on the estate in 1727 In 1692, Christian V granted the estate to Admiral Henrik Span who was at the same time raised to the peerage. He had been appointed as Head of Nyholm in 1690 where he had reorganized the naval base and modernised the operations at the Royal Danish Naval Dockyards. He settled on the estate and constructed a tower which enabled him to see the sea from the house. Volrad August von der L√ºhe with his family Span's widow kept the estate after his death just two years later. Their daughter and only child, Charlotte Amalie Henriksdatter Span, inherited it in 1722. The medical doctor and botanist Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll and the bishop Christian Michael Rottb√∏ll were born on the estate in 1727 and 1820. Their father, Christen Michelsen Rottb√∏ll, was manager of the estate. He died in 1820 and their mother later married the manager of nearby Hagestedgaard. Charlotte Amalie Henriksdatter Span had no children and returned the estate to the Crown in 1730. In 1744, H√∏rbygaard was granted to Volrad August von der L√ºhe. He had also been rewarded with the title of overpr√¶sident in Copenhagen. The Castenskiold family Jacoba von Holten, the widow of Johan Lorentz Castenschiold, acquired the estate in 1748. She ceded the estate to their second eldest son J√∏rgen Frederik von Castenschiold in 1760. He later also acquired Valbyg√•rd (1776-1803) and Store Frederikslund in Lille Frederikslund 1787. He implemented many of the agricultural reforms of the time. J√∏rgen Frederik von Castenschiold's son Casper inherited the estate in 1813. He adopted the name Grevencop-Castenschiold in 1826. His son Joachim Melchior Grevenkop-Castenschiold, who had inherited the estate in 1854, constructed a new main building in around 1861. The last copyholds were converted into freeholds in around 1900. The building was in the 20th century from 1935 for a while owned by a family trust and used as a summer camp for children from Copenhagen and a home for working class widows. Today The current owner is Christian Castenskiold. The estate covers 435 hectares of land.

The film is about allegations of antisemitism within the Labour Party. Pullman stated that he sought to place the allegations in a \\"wider historical context\\". The film features Jackie Walker, a Labour Party and anti-racist activist who was investigated by the party twice in 2016 following allegations of antisemitism. Members are suspended during investigations and the second suspension was still in force at the time of the film's release. The films covered some of the same ground as Walker's one woman show, The Lynching, and the television series, The Lobby. The film premiered at the Palace Cinema, Broadstairs on Sunday, 3 February 2019. A London screening followed on 10 February, followed by a Questions and Answers session featuring Alexei Sayle, Jon Pullman, Jackie Walker and Justin Schlosberg, chaired by Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi. Cancelled parliamentary screening The Labour Party MP, Chris Williamson was criticised by a Labour Party spokesperson for booking a room in the Houses of Parliament for a screening of the film scheduled for 4 March 2019, to be hosted by Jewish Voice for Labour. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and Labour MPs Tom Watson, Lilian Greenwood and Ruth Smeeth complained about the room booking to the Labour Party, despite the fact that none of them had viewed the film since it had not been publicly released. Jennie Formby, General Secretary of the Labour Party, and Nick Brown, Chief Whip of the Parliamentary Labour Party, stated they would ensure Williamson would cancel the screening, given that Walker was suspended. The screening was cancelled and Jewish Voice for Labour said that this was as a result of intimidation.
